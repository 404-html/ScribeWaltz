1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,220
Here we go.
Five,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,890
four,
three,

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,600
two,
one.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,050
David,
Joe,

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,590
how are you sir?
Great,

6
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:11,640
thanks.
Thanks for being here man.

7
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:13,220
I appreciate it.
Thanks for having me on.

8
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,260
I'm really looking forward to talking to
you very much so.

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,110
This is a fascinating subject for me.
Anti aging.

10
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,810
The idea that you'll be able to stop
aging or even possibly pull it back or

11
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:27,840
if they're very least slowed down.
What do you think?

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,500
I think that's all on the table.
We've been doing this for years in the

13
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,090
lab.
Now we've just got to figure out how to

14
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,190
do it in people.
When I talk to someone like you as an

15
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:36,960
actual research scientists to this
stuff,

16
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,180
I always want to know what are you doing
to yourself?

17
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,950
How long have you got?
Like what do you do a daily basis?

18
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:45,810
I do.
Are you 100 years old?

19
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,130
Uh,
getting there.

20
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,380
How old are you?
20.

21
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,030
50.
So if you're turning 50 and I wouldn't

22
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:54,150
have thought you were 50,
I would have figured you were for about

23
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:55,620
41.
Forty two.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,960
Oh,
that's kind of you.

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,340
One of my brothers,
the negative control and he's,

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
he's,
does he look like shit?

27
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,640
Well,
I can't say that,

28
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,570
but people say that he doesn't look as
young as me and he's about three and a

29
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:09,570
half years younger.
So what are you doing personally?

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,303
Uh,
well,

31
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,110
you know,
most of the time I'm in the lab and

32
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:16,410
trying to run a bunch of companies to
make these drugs are reality.

33
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,410
But daily I try to keep a healthy
weight.

34
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,250
I do intermittent fasting,
which is pretty easy because I'm so

35
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,240
busy.
I forget to eat.

36
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,910
How many hours do you give yourself
every night?

37
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,340
Uh,
well I suffer from a late night

38
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:31,050
snacking,
but I try to skip breakfast,

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,880
skip lunch if I'm busy.

40
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,870
So I'm a night eater,
but that seemed to be good because a

41
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,400
study came out about a couple of weeks
ago,

42
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:40,410
at least in mice that it's not what you
eat,

43
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:42,630
it's when you eat.
That's most important for longevity

44
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,440
really.
And when,

45
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,850
when being,
when like what's,

46
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,840
it doesn't actually matter if you eat a
lot in the morning or a lot at night.

47
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,130
I like nighttime eating,
but you need a period during the day at

48
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:58,050
least if you're a mouse,
probably if you're a human where you're

49
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,190
hungry,
um,

50
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,190
and that puts your body in a defensive
mode and these are the things that we've

51
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:04,020
been studying in my lab for the last 20
years.

52
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,850
What are the processes that died and
exercise do for us?

53
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:12,270
They keep us healthy and why does
calorie restriction and intermittent

54
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:16,380
fasting make animals live so much longer
and we think we figured out a large part

55
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:19,260
of how that works and now we're
mimicking that with molecules.

56
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,690
Um,
is the,

57
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,640
is the idea that you can mimic it with
molecules and it will be as effective as

58
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:29,880
intermittent fasting.
I think the molecules will be better.

59
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,230
And not only that,
when we add them onto a healthy diet and

60
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:36,240
exercise and the animals they do even
better.

61
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,840
It's like a supercharged mouse.
Now when you add them onto the mice,

62
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,360
do you also add them on with
intermittent fasting?

63
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:44,380
And is there an additional benefit?
Uh,

64
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,390
we do.
We do.

65
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,010
One of the first molecules that infants,
molecules that we are known for is

66
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:53,160
resveratrol from red wine.
That molecule discovered it in my

67
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,870
thirties,
or at least linked it to aging.

68
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,230
What we showed was that if you give it
to a fat mouse,

69
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,740
there was healthy as a thin mouse.

70
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,620
They live just as long.
They don't get heart disease and all of

71
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:05,290
the other bad stuff.
Then what we did was interesting.

72
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:10,291
We gave it to the mice either every day
in their food or let them skip a meal

73
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,610
every day so that they were fed every
other day.

74
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,120
And that combination of,
as virtual plus every other day feeding,

75
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,970
we had the longest lifespan we'd ever
seen.

76
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,230
And it was so.
It was additive.

77
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,980
Same with exercise.
If we give our latest molecule called

78
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,170
Ada men,
uh,

79
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,680
to a mouse and we exercise it,
it'll run even further than it could

80
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:33,070
with either of those alone.
So it's not an excuse to sit around and

81
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:37,510
just eat chips and watch TV.
It augments healthy lifestyle,

82
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:39,460
get you further than what you could get
naturally.

83
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,200
So in any,
are you seeing a benefit in addition?

84
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,480
So is the idea to compound all those
things together?

85
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,860
Exactly.
Right.

86
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,420
So you asked about myself.
So I,

87
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,820
I do,
I eat healthy,

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,560
I try to skip meals.
I also take supplements and in fact most

89
00:03:56,561 --> 00:04:00,640
of my colleagues are in the field of
aging or anti aging us as people call it

90
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,070
a.
So I take nmn every morning.

91
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,450
What is an m,
n?

92
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,490
Good question.
So let me take a quick step back.

93
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,630
Uh,
so about 20 years ago a Lenny Guarente

94
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:14,850
and a team of us at mit discovered a set
of genes that control aging in yeast

95
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,720
cells,
just bruise east,

96
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:20,740
what you find in beer and bread.
And those genes are called Sirtuin.

97
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,480
And there are seven of them in our
bodies,

98
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,050
five and yeast.
And what they do is they protect all

99
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,700
organisms on the planet,
plants,

100
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,810
bacteria,
humans from deterioration and disease.

101
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,690
They're like the Pentagon.
They sense when we're hungry since when

102
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,360
we're exercising and they send out the
troops to defend us.

103
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,950
So when you,
when you put more of these genes into a

104
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,260
reseller or a mouse,
they'll live longer between five to 20

105
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:46,930
percent longer.
And so we think that these genes are

106
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:49,510
responsible for the effects of dieting
and exercise,

107
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,680
which is great,
which what that means is we can now

108
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:54,670
mimic that with molecules.
So nmn is one of those molecules.

109
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:58,300
So Israel is virtual.
You can think of where as virtual as the

110
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,210
accelerator pedal for the Sirtuin genes.
And the sentiment is the,

111
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,850
is the fuel and without fuel reserve
virtual weren't works.

112
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,250
Nmn is the gas in the car I've heard of
resveratrol.

113
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:12,280
But as Nmn and new molecules is
commercially available,

114
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,730
some people started selling it on the
Internet as it related to an R,

115
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:22,960
which is sold by a bunch of companies.
And our year nicotine,

116
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:27,310
my driver's side is a supplement that
raises the levels of a molecule called

117
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,380
Nad feel like I should make a shopping
list.

118
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,940
So they get up here.
And so what are you writing that down to

119
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,940
that?
So the Sirtuins okay,

120
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,280
get this.
So sauternes need nad to work without

121
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:42,874
them.
Uh,

122
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,751
they're at work.
In fact,

123
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:46,420
if you don't have an ID in your body,
you'd be dead in about 30 seconds.

124
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,700
It's a really important molecule.
But as we get older,

125
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:51,070
we lose nad.
So by the time you're 50,

126
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:54,040
like I almost am,
you have about the half the levels of

127
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,950
once or you had when you were 20.
So that's not.

128
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,250
And these are two ends,
they don't protect the body without high

129
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:04,790
levels of Nad.
So what Nmn does and this other molecule

130
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,890
called nr,
which both you can get on the Internet,

131
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,510
they boost the body's levels of Nad
backup to youthful levels again,

132
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,750
and if we give them to mice,
these molecules t two mice Orient Worms

133
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,920
or yeast,
they live longer and they're super

134
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:19,754
healthy.

135
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,400
Now,
what level or how many milligrams are

136
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:24,290
you taking of these things?
Uh,

137
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,820
so yeah,
and a man is,

138
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,820
is um,
something I get from,

139
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,100
for myself,
I'm not selling anything.

140
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,630
So I take a gram of vitamin in the
morning based on clinical trials has

141
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,220
been shown that that will raise nad with
or without food.

142
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,500
Um,
I take a little bit of yogurt that I

143
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:43,310
make myself at home just to see,
uh,

144
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,170
you have been doing this for a while.
Uh,

145
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,300
and uh,
I only started doing stuff when I say

146
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:49,250
work in animals first.
So take,

147
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,330
take the yogurt mix in some ers.
Virtual research role is great,

148
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,400
but it's really insoluble.
It's like brick dust.

149
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,030
So in the yoga it'll dissolve.
Take another half a gram of reserve and

150
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,460
how much?
A half a gram.

151
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,730
Yeah,
it's,

152
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,860
it's a,
it's a powder.

153
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:06,710
I have a few kilos leftover from
clinical trials in my basement.

154
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,550
So yeah,
that's going to last me a few decades.

155
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,730
Uh,
and then I also take at night some

156
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,470
metformin,
which is probably the most radical thing

157
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:18,770
that I take,
which is a prescribed drug for diabetes.

158
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,390
Metformin met,
met him,

159
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,270
met and prescribable drug.
So you,

160
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,200
but you don't have diabetes?
I do not.

161
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,300
But you take it for,
for preventing cancer,

162
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,900
heart disease,
Alzheimer's and aging met.

163
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,120
Can you spell it?
Met F o r m I n

164
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,880
N.
and so studies have 10,000 people and

165
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,890
more.
It's been shown that people who take

166
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:49,670
metformin and even if they have diabetes
are protected against other diseases of

167
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:50,660
aging,
even frailty.

168
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,360
And so most scientists,
if you ask them in my field,

169
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:55,430
will say,
metformin is likely to extend your

170
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:58,130
lifespan.
It's just that the FDA doesn't let you

171
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,850
have it for aging because aging isn't a
disease yet.

172
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,650
So do you have to get diabetes to get it
or do you have to get a sneaky doctor?

173
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,060
Well,
I wouldn't call it sneaky doctor,

174
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:10,700
but the doctor typically has to be
convinced because they don't keep up

175
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:13,730
with the literature and it's off label.
Okay,

176
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,230
alright.
And how much do you take of that?

177
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,930
Uh,
I take a gram of that as well,

178
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,990
which is about a,
a low dose as some diabetics type two

179
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,400
grams.
So it's not crazy amounts.

180
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,110
Is there any side effects?
Well,

181
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,610
the good news is that it's extremely
rare that you get sick from any of these

182
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:31,250
molecules.
I'm in millions of patients around the

183
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:33,620
world.
Nobody's getting sick.

184
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:37,220
The worst you'll have as far as I can
tell is a stomach upset.

185
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,560
Um,
and I get that which is actually helpful

186
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,800
if I'm hungry or I lose my appetite.
But,

187
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:46,040
uh,
I think the downside is extremely low

188
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,510
and that the upside is,
you know,

189
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,900
anything's better than what's coming and
what is the mechanism that metformin is

190
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:53,894
operating.

191
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,910
So that,
so this is the great thing is that over

192
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,420
the last 20 years we have figured out,
we scientists have figured out that

193
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:04,790
there are universal regulators of aging
from yeast to worms to mice and in

194
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,990
treatments.
And there were three main pathways that

195
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:08,820
we figured out,
respond to what we eat,

196
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,660
how we exercise.
And one of them is called amp k a.

197
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,240
and this is a,
a target,

198
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:17,370
metformin.
And so I'm active.

199
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,650
When I take Metformin,
I'm activating my amp K,

200
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,700
which we'll send out the troops,
the Sir two ones I've mentioned.

201
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:28,170
That's the second of the pathways.
And so I take enemen and residual for

202
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:30,540
that.
And then third one is called

203
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,540
[inaudible],
which is a pathway in the body that

204
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,060
responds to how many amino acids,
how much meat you're eating.

205
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,460
And it will also protect the body if you
tweak it just the right way.

206
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,390
And as only besides eating low amounts
of protein,

207
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:48,060
the only way to,
to affect that pathways with a drug

208
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:50,100
called Rapamycin,
which is,

209
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,280
which is a little dangerous to try and
is used for a immunosuppressant.

210
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,290
So it's not something that I would
recommend a and I don't take it.

211
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,350
Wow.
So this is your daily routine along with

212
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,810
what,
what kind of Diet do you follow?

213
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,510
Well,
I,

214
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,030
I try to not eat too much.
It's pretty easy to overeat.

215
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,950
So I'd try to skip one or two meals a
day.

216
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,910
Um,
I avoid sugars and carbs.

217
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,070
I try to run once a week.
I do workouts on the weekend.

218
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,420
Like you,
I,

219
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,640
I love Saunas.
I like to put my body in some

220
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:30,140
temperature stress.
I go hate.

221
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,630
And then I jumped in a cold bath back
and forth that,

222
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,530
that works well for yeast.
We can do that in lab and they live 30

223
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:37,430
percent longer.
So

224
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,263
there's all that.

225
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,860
Do you have to try generally?
I normally.

226
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,440
Do you ever try going from Sauna to
cryotherapy?

227
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:46,790
Uh,
no.

228
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,570
I haven't tried actual cryotherapy.
Just a.

229
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,620
You haven't done it at all?
No.

230
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,100
You want to do it today?
Sure.

231
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:52,761
If he got one.
Yeah,

232
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:53,720
yeah.
We'll take you.

233
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,840
Take you down the street.
There's a great one because it's,

234
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,080
there's different kinds and some of them
are from the neck down.

235
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,810
Were they using liquid nitrogen?
The other ones,

236
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:06,410
they actually freeze the air.
So when they're using the nitrogen to

237
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,730
freeze the air and they're pumping in
air that's 240 degrees below zero and

238
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:11,240
you're,
you know,

239
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,840
you're going to do about two minutes.
I do three because I do it all the time,

240
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,460
but uh,
it's awesome.

241
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,220
I do three and then I take 10 minutes
off and then I go back in for another

242
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,054
three.

243
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,111
Yeah,
makes sense.

244
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:22,640
And what you're doing to your body when
you do that,

245
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,510
we think is to activate these longevity
pathways like this or two ends.

246
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,800
Yeah.
And uh,

247
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:30,470
and that's really the trick is to
activate your body's defenses against

248
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:32,020
aging.
I mean,

249
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,040
the old theories about aging,
you got to throw them out.

250
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,200
Most people at parties will tell you,
oh,

251
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,090
antioxidants,
free radicals,

252
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:43,010
DNA damage or mutations.
That is all for the most part,

253
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,023
incorrect

254
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,690
that antioxidants cause DNA damage.
No,

255
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:50,360
that's true.
That it repairs DNA damage.

256
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,740
Well,
intoxicants had been a rather big in the

257
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:54,130
aging

258
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,230
field,
but resveratrol and antioxidant,

259
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:57,130
correct.
Uh,

260
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:00,080
it's a mild antioxidant,
but it doesn't work by being an intox.

261
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,750
What does it work?
What is the pathway?

262
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,810
It steps on the accelerator pedal of the
Sirtuin enzymes.

263
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,160
And so it's directly controlling,
uh,

264
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,590
the body's defenses against aging.
So as we discussed it,

265
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,870
or as people discussed it as an
antioxidant,

266
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,880
it was just a mom,
a mild form of antibiotics,

267
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,610
an antioxidant,
but it didn't so much more.

268
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,460
Right?
And we know this because if you create a

269
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,350
yeast cell or a worm or a mouse,
and then you knock out the gene for the

270
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:29,110
Sirtuin,
now reversal doesn't help the animal

271
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:30,730
anymore.
That's interesting because when people

272
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:32,740
talk about wine,
that's the one thing they say.

273
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:35,170
There is very Charles and antioxidants
really good for you.

274
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,090
Yeah.
This is one of those urban myths that

275
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,670
never goes away and still fuels a
billion dollar industry.

276
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,740
But what we're finding is that the
molecules in plants like where's

277
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,100
virtual,
first of all that we think that produced

278
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:47,260
by plants,
because the plants are benefiting from

279
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,900
the stress,
we call it Hormesis,

280
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,060
a little bit of stress is good for you,
what doesn't kill you,

281
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:57,061
makes you stronger kind of thing.
And Hermes was discovered about 60,

282
00:12:57,641 --> 00:13:01,570
70 years ago when people were spraying
herbicides on plants and a little bit of

283
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:05,210
herbicide actually made them stronger.
And we think that these molecules in

284
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:07,840
plants are similar.
They make the plant stronger during

285
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:11,200
times of stress.
So if you stress a grape that's for

286
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,050
winemaking,
you'll get great wine,

287
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,100
but you also get a lot of resveratrol.
And so when we ingest that resveratrol

288
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:21,580
from the clients,
we get the same health benefits because

289
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:24,570
the plants are activating their
serotonin pathways and we have the

290
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,290
[inaudible] and they activate us as
well.

291
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,090
Ah,
interesting.

292
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,850
Interesting.
So low carb,

293
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,570
low sugar,
um,

294
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,100
any specific type of protein?
Do you limit your amount of protein?

295
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,580
Yeah,
I mean I enjoy eating memos just as much

296
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:40,400
as anybody.
But,

297
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,660
um,
I try to avoid them for the main,

298
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,220
were two main reasons.
One is that,

299
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,310
uh,
there's this tmao molecule that seems to

300
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,440
cause heart disease.
Tmao.

301
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

302
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,700
Um,
and how's it linked to heart disease?

303
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,830
A disease epidemiology studies,
I forget,

304
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:04,330
but I do recall it.
The study was able to give the Tmao to

305
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,220
animals and they developed heart
disease.

306
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,400
So it's somehow causing it.
I forget exactly how it might be

307
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:13,450
damaging the genome.
That's my recollection with a omnivores

308
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,090
or predators.
Uh,

309
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,910
I think as red meat is the culprit,
right?

310
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,360
So are they giving us to rats are the
given this too?

311
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,070
It was a mouse study again,
so I mean mice might be different from

312
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,830
humans of course.
Uh,

313
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,420
but the other problem with,
with meat in general from,

314
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,170
from animals is that there's a lot of
noise in there and it's easy to eat a

315
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,380
lot of meat.
And so if you have high levels of mino

316
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:39,070
acids,
it will activate this mtor pathway,

317
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:42,850
one of those three longevity pathways.
And you don't want that.

318
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,090
You don't want that.
You don't want that because [inaudible]

319
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,790
has evolved to cents times of adversity
and stress and hunger.

320
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,010
So why do people see a performance
benefit when

321
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,230
they consume branch chain amino acids?

322
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,310
A really good question.
So in the short run,

323
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:04,200
just like taking testosterone,
it will give you performance benefits,

324
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,010
but we think in the long run it'll
actually come back to bite you.

325
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,310
So how will blend branched chain amino
acids come back to bite you.

326
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,580
So branch chain amino acids will
activate this mtor pathway.

327
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,800
Um,
and

328
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,860
when we do that in animals,
we actually,

329
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,900
we reduced their lifespan.
So it's the opposite.

330
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:26,670
You want to keep those levels low.
That's interesting that that seems,

331
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,360
I mean,
for a dummy like me,

332
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,230
it seems counterintuitive because it,
what's making you perform better.

333
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,120
Currently you would see,
you would think,

334
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:37,120
especially something like amino acids
and natural part of the human body,

335
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,160
you would think that that would be
beneficial.

336
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,380
You're adding to your body.
It's something that it needs.

337
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,303
Yeah,
you would.

338
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,800
But,
but what you should consider is that

339
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:48,070
it's a tradeoff off.
There's a theory that's probably

340
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:49,450
correct.
Uh,

341
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,100
it's the,
uh,

342
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,570
some Tom Kirkwood's terror theory called
the disposable Soma and our bodies want

343
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:58,300
to do one of two things,
either want to grow really fast and

344
00:15:58,301 --> 00:16:01,750
reproduce fast,
build up a lot of muscle cells,

345
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:04,030
divide that's great.
In the short run,

346
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,800
you know,
you'd be fertile,

347
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:09,220
you can run,
but actually that set the expensive

348
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,390
hunkering down and building a long
lasting body and that's a tradeoff over

349
00:16:13,391 --> 00:16:15,760
time.
And so animals that grow fast and

350
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:18,640
reproduce fast,
like a mouse will only have a short

351
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:23,170
lifespan.
Whereas a whale that grows slowly and

352
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:25,780
reproduced slowly will live a long time.
Interesting.

353
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:26,763
So

354
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,220
the idea is you're,
you're limiting your calories,

355
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,180
eliminating your carbohydrates,
you're limiting your protein,

356
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:38,170
you're limiting your amino acids,
but you're ramping up on all these

357
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,400
beneficial molecules,
right?

358
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,280
These,
these pathways that have evolved since

359
00:16:44,281 --> 00:16:48,240
the beginning of life to make us live
longer during adversity so he can thrive

360
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,770
when times come back.

361
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,900
Do you take into consideration quality
of life versus length of life?

362
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,300
Like is there a sweet spot?

363
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,460
Yeah,
that.

364
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,530
Well,
it's hard to ask the mice how they feel,

365
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,950
but they,
we do test them and we do frailty

366
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:07,370
studies and we can see that they got
better memory and they can run further

367
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:11,180
on a treadmill.
The stronger those kinds of things they

368
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:14,780
see better and we think that that
probably means they're happier as well.

369
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,490
And when you're taking in protein,
so if you're not eating mammals,

370
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:21,210
are you eating a lot of fish?
Yeah,

371
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,270
fish is fine.
White meat.

372
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:27,040
I indulge A.
I like chipped in that kind of chickens,

373
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,880
fine.
I'm not too much of it,

374
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,370
but I'm trying to eat as many
vegetables,

375
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:35,080
especially the colored ones for the
reason that I said which is well,

376
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,280
a few reasons.
One is that you don't ingest as much

377
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:40,930
protein as you otherwise would.
You get all the vitamins,

378
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:44,750
but you also get those molecules from
plants that we think make you healthy.

379
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,620
So reserves will just one of a bunch of
polyphenols that plants make when

380
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:50,850
they're stressed and when plants are
stressed,

381
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:54,360
they go colored so that the purples and
the reds and blues,

382
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,670
yeah,
those are molecules that are generally

383
00:17:56,671 --> 00:18:00,780
healthy and I think one of the few
scientists who thinks this,

384
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:05,640
but I think we've evolved as animals to
sense the plant world and when our food

385
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:09,720
supply is stressed out,
then our body's sense that bite when we

386
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,660
ingest them,
we get these molecules like virtual and

387
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:17,040
we've evolved to sense that and we get
the benefits of longevity as a side

388
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,620
effect.
And so

389
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,940
this is really fascinating to me because
the idea that you're trying to balance

390
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:29,941
out this,
the concept of a mouse growing very

391
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,280
quickly but dying quickly as well versus
something that can extend and live

392
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:41,401
longer and be more vital or have more
vitality for a longer period of time.

393
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,380
Well,
so here's the great thing is that now

394
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:46,430
that we've,
we believe,

395
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:49,250
we figured out why,
not just why,

396
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:52,340
but how this all works.
What are the genes and pathways in the

397
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,760
body that control this?
We can have our cake and eat it too.

398
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,170
We can at least in a mouse and probably
in a human in a few years' time,

399
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,720
and maybe even with the supplements
we'll see.

400
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:08,290
We can trick the body into being hungry
and being in adversity or even if you're

401
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:13,730
eating a lot or you're not exercising
and so we can turn slowly,

402
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:18,731
but eventually turning a mouse into more
like a human so that you,

403
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,930
even though you can grow and reproduce
quickly,

404
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,110
you still turn on these protective
pathways and live a long time.

405
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,890
The best example is the nematode worm,
artsy elegance.

406
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,510
It's been studied a lot for longevity
and the mutations that make those worms

407
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:37,220
live sometimes two and up to 10 times
longer are activating genes that are

408
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,610
normally only turned on when they
hunkered down and turn into a little

409
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,670
dour,
dour or a stage,

410
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:44,660
which means that they're.

411
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,990
They're not really reproducing,
they're just hibernating.

412
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,040
So you can have a hibernation of
benefits but still live a normal healthy

413
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,860
life.
And this is from manipulating genes.

414
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,870
Right?
So this all comes from genetics.

415
00:19:56,871 --> 00:20:00,890
So I'm a geneticist at Harvard and the
way the breakthrough came,

416
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,570
so going back in the 19 eighties,
it was antioxidants mutations because

417
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,630
people really didn't have a handle on
what was going on and the idea that you

418
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:13,370
could slow down aging with one gene or
one drug was ludicrous because it's so

419
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:16,460
complicated,
but now we know from genetic studies is

420
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:20,180
that you can find mutations,
hundreds of them actually in organisms

421
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:23,690
that it linkedin lifespan.
So it's not as complicated as we

422
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:27,170
thought.
What about Myostatin inhibitors and the

423
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:30,290
studies that they've done with mice?
They turned them on and off and they've

424
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,420
grown those super mice.
Yeah.

425
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,300
Hock mice wellbeing.
A hulk doesn't mean you'll live longer,

426
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,100
right?
Didn't they live longer though?

427
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,110
I don't know.
Did they?

428
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,390
I believe they did.
I think that was one of the weird side

429
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:42,860
effects.
Well,

430
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,630
if you allow me to speculate as to why
that might've happened is so

431
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,410
being bulky is good,
let's find out what's correct for.

432
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,400
And Jamie will pull it up.
Well one of them,

433
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,680
but one of the things it bulky is good.
Bulky will increase your metabolism,

434
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:59,920
it'll get rid of the fat and the fat is
a real problem because fred fat will

435
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,340
make you inflamed.
Being fat is one of the worst things you

436
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:06,970
can you just fat shamed I did were very,
very upset at you right now.

437
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,980
Well,
build up muscle as well.

438
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:12,460
Some people are overweight and have a
lot of muscle and they're a lot better

439
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:17,170
off when you teach classes,
I assume I teach at Harvard.

440
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:20,770
Yeah.
And when you say that fat is bad,

441
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,590
do you get a new reaction over the last
couple of years?

442
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,450
Uh,
or do you,

443
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,450
do you find a way around saying it like
that you generally get okay.

444
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:32,350
Comments on my lectures,
but I wasn't saying fat people are bad

445
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,240
or saying having found in your vice
sells a bad.

446
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,240
Okay.
I like what you're saying.

447
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,320
So you're breaking it down to cells.
You're not picking on anybody here at

448
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,750
Myostatin.
Insufficiency produces 15 percent life

449
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:45,160
extension in mice.
So yeah.

450
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,370
So those milestone inhibitors make the
mice grow longer.

451
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:53,350
So you think that might have had an
effect by virtue of the fact that

452
00:21:53,351 --> 00:21:56,710
they're more bulky and they have more
muscle tissue and they burn off more

453
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,570
fat.
That's one theory.

454
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,770
The other thing would be that so muscles
are secreting molecules called myokines

455
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:05,980
into the bloodstream and we don't know
what they all are,

456
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,280
but when you exercise,
you do release some of these and they

457
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,520
may also be contributing because muscles
are signaling to the whole body.

458
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,230
When you go for a run,
it's not that your muscles get an

459
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,530
exercise.
Everything in your body gets an exercise

460
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:21,250
by these communication molecules and
that's why if you fuse and old mouse to

461
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,100
young mouse,
you can have these benefits that the

462
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:27,830
young mouse and parts on the olden
actually negatively vice versa.

463
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,360
And when you save by fuse you mean by
taking the blood of the old mouse and

464
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,910
putting it into the young man?
Right?

465
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,420
But what we.
What we actually do,

466
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,550
because that's too hard.
You don't need humans,

467
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:40,480
but in mice what you do as you saw the
skin together so that the blood flows

468
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:42,400
between them.
Yeah.

469
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:46,840
It's not so pleasant,
but they don't seem to be too badly

470
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,790
affected once they learn how to walk in
sync.

471
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,530
Now,
by the way,

472
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:55,840
to all your listeners,
we don't do those experiments in my lab,

473
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:59,740
but when I say we,
I mean the scientific community as a

474
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:00,750
whole.
Um,

475
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,400
what,
what are your thoughts on if you have

476
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:05,890
any,
about the startups that are actually

477
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:10,891
taking the blood of young people and in
injecting it into the bodies of older

478
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:12,814
folks?

479
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,400
So I don't think there's a scientific
reason to say it won't work and the

480
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:20,440
scientists are involved or some of my
great colleagues,

481
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,960
very smart people.
Have you ever done it?

482
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,300
No.
No.

483
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,010
That's a bit extreme for me,
but I think it could work.

484
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,480
It's just a little bit out there for me,
but what they're going to do,

485
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:34,720
what they're doing actually is treating
people with neurological disorders.

486
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,920
A lot of these startups,
and I'm involved in probably 15 startups

487
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:41,140
right now.
What we're trying to do is to treat

488
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:45,830
diseases of aging and even rare
childhood diseases because you can't

489
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:46,070
treat

490
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,940
it aging as a business model.
There is no disease called aging yet,

491
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,340
but anyway,
getting back to the science,

492
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:54,260
I think that it's based on solid
science,

493
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,580
but the future is,
is I think a better way to go about this

494
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:02,330
is to find what the actual molecules are
in the blood and just make those.

495
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:05,380
Don't give the whole kit caboodle.
Yeah.

496
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,790
When you said this twice,
you think aging is a disease or maybe

497
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:12,430
perhaps should be treated as a disease
or classified?

498
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,470
Oh,
absolutely.

499
00:24:13,471 --> 00:24:15,420
Think aging should be classified as a
disease.

500
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,110
We should think of it as a disease.
I mean why?

501
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,540
Why shouldn't we?
Everything else that goes on in the body

502
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:24,540
over time that's bad for us is
considered a disease.

503
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,270
Do you know why aging isn't considered a
disease?

504
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,430
Because it happens to everybody?
Exactly.

505
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,190
That's the only reason.
Well,

506
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,300
it happens to most people.
Ninety percent of people in the

507
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:35,610
developed world,
but why is that a reason to say,

508
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,301
oh,
it's natural.

509
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:39,990
We should just deal with it.
We used to say that about cancer and we

510
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:41,610
used to say it about dying from an
infection.

511
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,800
When you say it happens to 90 percent of
the people in the developed world,

512
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,910
what happens?
The other 10,

513
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,710
they die.

514
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,380
He'd play a boss I guess.
Okay.

515
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,270
Let's see what you're saying.
So they die young.

516
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,483
Yeah.
Okay.

517
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,030
Just clarifying.

518
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,251
Yeah,
I agree.

519
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:58,580
I mean it's dis ease.
It's a problem,

520
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,910
right?
Aging is a problem with you.

521
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,580
I saw an old gentleman yesterday and it
was painful just to watch this poor guy

522
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:09,581
walk hunched over and just struggling to
move at an incredibly slow pace.

523
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,870
That seems like a person with the
disease.

524
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:12,981
Well,
it is.

525
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:16,340
And imagine if we were on a planet now
or you know,

526
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,650
an island where everybody leaves 300
years and we'd show up and you and I in

527
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:24,530
our midlife was signed to look older
already.

528
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:27,380
They're going to look at us and say,
what is wrong with you guys?

529
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,820
We need to treat you urgently.
We need to call this a new type of

530
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:35,870
syndrome.
And it's only because we all tend to go

531
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:37,640
through this that we think it's
acceptable,

532
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:43,180
but I would argue it's the biggest
threat to the healthcare system is the

533
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:45,080
biggest threat to the world's economy,
actually,

534
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,610
is the inability of us to treat people
in their old age and keeping them

535
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:50,990
healthy.
Mm.

536
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:56,580
Now some people look at it a different
way and their consideration is that

537
00:25:56,581 --> 00:25:59,280
there's an overpopulation problem as it
is.

538
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:04,050
And folks like you want to walk around
living to be 300 years old,

539
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,380
have a gang of kids.
You could create a mess.

540
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,330
Right?
Well I have three kids.

541
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,040
That's enough.
That's more than I was going to have a.

542
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,130
But yeah,
it,

543
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,600
we do.
You have to do the math though.

544
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,710
How much with the population grow,
and

545
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,500
I'm actually working with a number of
people to try and calculate this.

546
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,130
A couple of economists in London that
we're working on.

547
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,960
So this is this really a problem.
I agree with you that if this comes in,

548
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:34,630
I would actually say when this comes,
when this comes is,

549
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,840
I mean it's coming as there's dozens of
companies working on drugs.

550
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,650
The sciences here,
so let's say it's coming anyway,

551
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:44,490
so we have to deal with how are we going
to deal with it?

552
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,960
Well,
let's first of all understand what the

553
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:48,420
future looks like.
We can't look backwards,

554
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,250
right?
Because no one's ever invented this

555
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:52,050
stuff before,
so we have to look forwards.

556
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,110
What's the world look like in terms of
population?

557
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,640
It's not as bad as you might think.
If you stopped aging today and everybody

558
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:04,641
just went on forever,
the population growth rate would be less

559
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,820
than the rate of immigration.
Now that's not.

560
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,020
I can't go on forever of course,
but what we find is as people healthier,

561
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,260
especially in developing nations,
they have fewer kids,

562
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,560
so the calculation shows that it would
eventually taper off,

563
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:23,400
so the human population will taper off
about nine to 10 billion people and then

564
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:26,070
stay there and that population will be
the happiest,

565
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:27,360
healthiest people in the world.

566
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,160
Now,
why do they predict that?

567
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,340
Because I was having this conversation
with someone the other day that as

568
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,590
people become more affluent and society
becomes more urban,

569
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,710
people will have less and less children
and the population will stabilize.

570
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:42,930
Is that the theory behind this?

571
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,650
Right.
And we'll actually education is a major

572
00:27:45,651 --> 00:27:46,760
part of that as well.
Yeah.

573
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,610
Women's education is the main thing,
uh,

574
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,980
but also just being healthy or lifts
the,

575
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,210
the wealth of a nation.
And by women's education,

576
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,760
do you mean extended education so that
they,

577
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,620
the,
they pursue careers?

578
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:00,870
Is that

579
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,190
the,
the idea or is it,

580
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,830
I mean,
obviously most people understand

581
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,430
these are made like where?
Where's the education contributing to a

582
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:10,290
lower population?
Well,

583
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,990
so my understanding is that the first
thing you do,

584
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,610
if you,
if you educate young women,

585
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:17,100
is that they can make choices for
themselves and they are not just

586
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,580
subjugated,
uh,

587
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,650
you know,
most men would like to have more so,

588
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,790
right.
So you're thinking of like third world

589
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:26,760
and write the real developing world,
but that's where the population is a

590
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:29,160
real problem in Europe.
They actually are struggling to keep up

591
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:33,600
with their population,
know they've got an aging tsunami,

592
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:35,310
so to speak.
Same with Japan.

593
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:37,350
The average farmer in Japan is 65 years
old.

594
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:39,960
They got a real problem.
China's about to head that way too,

595
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,230
and that's going to drag the economy of
the planet down and it's gonna be a real

596
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:45,060
problem.
We're going to waste so much money on

597
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:46,950
keeping older people alive for the last
10,

598
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:48,540
20 years of their life with dementia.

599
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,090
Frailty,
that could be trillions of dollars,

600
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,480
just $50,000,000,000,000 just in this
country alone that could be spent on

601
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,090
figuring out how to solve global
warming,

602
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,910
better education,
the environment,

603
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,660
saving the one third species that are
becoming threatened.

604
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,180
That,
that's why I think tackling aging isn't

605
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:08,290
a selfish act.
It's probably the most generous Dec

606
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:12,450
action that I could give the planet.
That's an interesting way of looking at

607
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,350
it.
Um,

608
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,110
what populations as a whole,
you know,

609
00:29:16,111 --> 00:29:17,830
when you look at the world,
um,

610
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,340
what,
where are the people living the longest

611
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,470
and why?
Well,

612
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:24,930
it's debatable.
There are these blue zones.

613
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,330
I think many of your listeners will have
heard about those.

614
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,570
Um,
but there are pockets that have great

615
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,630
genes,
but they also have great diets and

616
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:34,680
lifestyles.
And so the,

617
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,910
the best one that I'm familiar with is
the island of Okinawa in Japan.

618
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,980
And uh,
and by the way I used to follow the

619
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,830
Okinawan Diet,
a couple of my good friends wrote a book

620
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:48,070
about it,
so I was on to when some fish felt

621
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:49,270
really great,
couldn't keep it up,

622
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,310
but those,
why couldn't you keep it up?

623
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,280
I had kids and our meals turned into
pizzas and pasta.

624
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,770
Yeah,
unfortunately.

625
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:59,590
But I'm getting back there now that my
kids are teenagers,

626
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:04,591
but the Okinawans date,
they live into their hundreds of,

627
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,000
fairly frequently.
It's not one in a million.

628
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,580
It's more like one in 100,000 or
something.

629
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:11,460
So it's 10 times higher.
They,

630
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,560
they work most of their lives.
They physically active,

631
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,300
they fast a lot and they have a lot of
green leafy vegetables and that seems to

632
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:21,370
be the secret.
And there's,

633
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:22,520
uh,
there were,

634
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,340
there were selling something was
something about their mineral rich diet.

635
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,960
Remember they were selling,
it was like a big thing for awhile.

636
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,310
Coral calcium.
And they were using that as an example

637
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:35,950
of why the Okinawans were living so
long.

638
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:37,650
Do you remember that?
I do remember add,

639
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,480
yeah.
But in scientific circles we weren't

640
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:41,314
really bothered with it.

641
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,530
Yeah,
like there's calcium is calcium,

642
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:45,520
right?
Yeah.

643
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,940
I didn't know better,
better,

644
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,920
better calcium from coral or something.
I might even be wrong about that,

645
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:56,260
but I just remember reading about the
Okinawans and the speculation.

646
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,940
They seaweed as well.
Right?

647
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,600
Which is very healthy.
Probably the best thing that they do is

648
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,140
they don't overeat.
Stop at 70 percent.

649
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,600
Yeah,
I'm a glutton.

650
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,050
That's my number one problem.
I just love to eat.

651
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,771
Yeah.
Yeah.

652
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:14,020
Me Too.
I keep going once I'm in it,

653
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,420
I just want to just keep shoving it in
my face,

654
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,750
but I've done a good job over the last
few years of tapering that off and the

655
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:22,510
intermittent fast and I think is
probably one of the best things I've

656
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:24,040
ever done in terms of,
you know,

657
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:28,030
just maintaining energy levels,
maintaining body weight,

658
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,360
that kind of stuff.
Yeah.

659
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,300
Yeah.
You,

660
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,650
you look good.
So I think that that's one of the best

661
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:33,550
things that people can do.

662
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,110
What we've known for 70 or more years
actually as if you calorie restrict

663
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,200
animals actually even eat cells and
worlds.

664
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:45,820
They live longer and this is the most
robust way to to prevent cancer,

665
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,740
heart disease,
Alzheimer's in the mouse,

666
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,020
and so intimate and fasting is just a
way of me making this calorie restricted

667
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:55,210
diet.
So what is calorie restriction?

668
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:58,390
It's reducing what would your doctor
would recommend for your body,

669
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,880
but reducing it back to about 20 to 30
percent.

670
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:03,340
So it's quite extreme.
That's not pleasant.

671
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,260
I tried that for a week,
gave up too hard,

672
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,440
but intermittent fasting like yourself,
it's doable.

673
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,870
It's not always pleasant,
but uh,

674
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:14,140
I think that's the best way to do it.
And with the mice it works just as well

675
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,860
as calorie restriction,
which is pretty much always being a bit

676
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:20,980
hungry now.
What other things are you looking at in

677
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:25,981
terms of mitigating stress or like what
other factors are there that you have to

678
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:27,304
keep an eye on?

679
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,810
Yeah,
stress is a bad one.

680
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,850
I try to
take life in my stride,

681
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,190
not get too worried about it.
Remember what's important.

682
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,430
So my heart rate rarely goes up.
Um,

683
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,150
even under a really extreme
circumstances and that that's about it.

684
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:49,180
I try to balance my life as best I can.
I don't go through airport scanners as

685
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:52,580
much as I can and have x rays,
these little things.

686
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,670
Do you think those are bad for you?
Those are the new ones.

687
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:57,380
Aren't there like a radio wave?
Yeah,

688
00:32:57,381 --> 00:32:58,910
they're,
they're millimeter radio waves.

689
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,790
I don't want to take any chances and
also don't want to freak people out.

690
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,670
But the old style ones that were banned
in Europe first,

691
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,790
they were potentially damaging x-rays.
Definitely.

692
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,870
Uh,
try not to have as many as you can,

693
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:17,350
but flying is just as bad as an x ray.
Well that's the problem that I was going

694
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:20,420
through a scanner and I said I don't
want to go through the scanner and they

695
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:23,810
got quite upset because it's a bother,
but they said,

696
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,600
you know,
it's just as much damage to your body as

697
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:27,350
the flight.

698
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,150
And so I said,
why do I want to double it?

699
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,730
So anyway,
so I go through scan is,

700
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,250
but I try not to.
But let me tell you why I think it's so

701
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:39,251
bad because scan isn't going to change
what we call the epigenome.

702
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,060
Now,
a lot of people haven't heard of the

703
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,160
epigenome,
the genome,

704
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:49,040
everybody knows it's your DNA.
Uh,

705
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,660
the code of life,
the epigenome is what regulates and

706
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:55,590
reads those genes at the right time.
Okay?

707
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,830
And so we've,
we knew about DNA,

708
00:33:57,831 --> 00:33:59,390
we know how to read the genome pretty
easily.

709
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:03,530
We can do that now on a Mozbar sized
device in a day.

710
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,420
Uh,
the epigenomes quite difficult

711
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:08,840
different.
The epigenome is that the structure of

712
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:11,300
how the DNA is looped around.
If you look at the chromosome,

713
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:14,020
you're not seeing the genome,
you're really basically saying

714
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,440
epigenomes and what w,
what I think is causing aging is not

715
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:22,220
that you're losing the DNA structure,
you're not having mutations,

716
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,580
you're actually changing the epigenome,
which is the,

717
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,700
the reader of the genes to put another
way,

718
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,730
a compact disc,
okay?

719
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,690
Uh,
for the young audience,

720
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,860
a compact discs are little things we
used to put music on a.

721
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,033
But anyway,
these are,

722
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,130
these are digital information of course.
And the reason we switched to digital in

723
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:44,390
the first place is that it's very
copyable and it doesn't wear out.

724
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,100
Reza,
a cassette tape,

725
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,920
you know,
people our age know that if you try to

726
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,200
copy that a thousand times,
there's not much left at the end.

727
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,310
So the,
the Compact disc inflammation is the

728
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:58,700
genome,
the epigenome is the reader of the CD,

729
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,260
that little laser that goes around and
what I think is causing aging is not the

730
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:06,140
loss of the digital information,
but it's the reader,

731
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,800
the analog part,
and that's like a cassette tape that

732
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:12,070
eventually runs out.
So what we,

733
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,340
what's going on really is that your
cells are losing the ability to read the

734
00:35:16,341 --> 00:35:18,950
right genes the way they did when you
were 20.

735
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,450
And that's basically noise informational
noise that gathers over time.

736
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,530
Um,
and so what we end up with when we're 80

737
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:32,000
is a compact disc or DVD that scratched.
So the reader cannot read the right

738
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:34,430
genes,
that right time in the cells become

739
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:37,620
dysfunctional.
Now what we're working on is highly that

740
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:41,040
cd or that DVD to get that information
back again.

741
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,580
And if you can do that,
I think that's really the best way to

742
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:48,000
reset your age.
And we haven't published it yet,

743
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:50,610
but uh,
we're working on ways to actually reset

744
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,470
that genome and actually get back the
information that we once had when were

745
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:57,960
20.
So what is happening to the epigenome

746
00:35:57,961 --> 00:35:59,190
when you're going through those
scanners?

747
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,440
Well,
so what we found is the biggest

748
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:05,340
disruptor of the epigenome is a,
a broken chromosome,

749
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,610
DNA break,
and I don't know about scanners,

750
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:10,440
that's just an abundance of caution.

751
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,350
But an x ray will damage your DNA.
No question.

752
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,770
I'm even going out in the sun,
will do a bit of that.

753
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:22,140
And we think that the cells reaction to
that break having to unwrap the DNA from

754
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:24,480
its Chromatin,
we call it and uh,

755
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,450
and then rewrap it is what eventually
disrupts the ability to read the right

756
00:36:29,451 --> 00:36:33,210
thing at the right place.
So Dna damage is essentially a little

757
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:35,100
scratch on,
on the DVD.

758
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,170
And that accumulates over time.
So being out in the sun does that,

759
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,820
but being out in the sun also is
beneficial.

760
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:44,700
Your body produces more vitamin D.
Yeah.

761
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:46,230
Well,
so there's also a theory called

762
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,690
antagonistic pleiotropy,
which is what's good for you when you're

763
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,610
young.
Comes back to bite you when you're old,

764
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,390
so you might look good and feel good and
get vitamin D when you're young.

765
00:36:54,391 --> 00:36:59,010
But the accumulation of these scratches
on the epigenome ends up.

766
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,440
You know,
I'm formally in an Australian originally

767
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:03,540
in Australia now,
American and Australian.

768
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,560
I grew up in this straight and son.
And I can tell you that,

769
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,260
you know,
most Australians look older than they

770
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:15,261
should know ozone now.
Ozone and lack of sunscreen in the 19

771
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:17,430
seventies.
Why do you guys have a whole nails on

772
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:19,140
over Australia?
What's that all about?

773
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,370
What you do?
No,

774
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,650
it's what,
what did the world to chloroform Cognos

775
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,130
to assure a well,
hairspray.

776
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,150
Why does it accumulate over Australia as
a theory?

777
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,230
It started in Antarctica and uh,
so ozone will.

778
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,030
That had been convenient.
Nobody's up there.

779
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,160
Leave it up there.
Yeah.

780
00:37:36,161 --> 00:37:38,910
Well,
if you need to blow it that way.

781
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,080
Yeah.
Well,

782
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,080
yeah,
that the ozone layer is fairly

783
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:43,830
important.
Uh,

784
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,810
if you don't want to get singed by UV
light.

785
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,191
Yeah.
Well,

786
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:50,310
that's one of the first things I noticed
when I went to Australia was a,

787
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,270
there's all these sun cancer warnings,
skin cancer warnings everywhere.

788
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,610
Well,
a third of Australians get some form of

789
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,590
skin cancer,
so that's crazy.

790
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,420
Yeah.
But what's also gonna happen is it'll

791
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,970
disrupt your epic genome over time and
you'll look old,

792
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,000
but if you have an extra,
you're going to damage your organs.

793
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:08,190
You can accelerate aging,
I believe in your body.

794
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,570
Um,
and it happened.

795
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:12,660
You can't avoid double strand breaks.
Cra broken chromosomes happens all the

796
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:14,760
time.
There's trillions of cells in your body

797
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:17,670
and it's happening all the time.
So living is a problem.

798
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,230
Okay?
Flying,

799
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,880
flying is even worse about what you're
working on is how do you get back that

800
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:26,970
original information into the cell and
make a sell.

801
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,360
Not just believe that it's 20 again,
but actually be 20.

802
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,540
So what do you do?
We reprogram them.

803
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,980
There are a set of genes that we and
others have found a three main ones that

804
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,760
when you put them into a cell or even
into a mouse,

805
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,950
uh,
they become younger again.

806
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,460
Whoa.
How far do you think you are from

807
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,460
implementing this on human beings as
well?

808
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:53,990
So theoretically are you doing to
yourself and you could,

809
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,070
you could do it to yourself.
Theoretically I wouldn't do that because

810
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,250
I'm not crazy.
We need to figure out the safety.

811
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,580
I don't want to become a giant tumor
while we'll just use it on bad people.

812
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,080
Uh,
yeah.

813
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,710
Well that take people coming tournament
18 year olds and go,

814
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:09,730
whoa.
Yeah.

815
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,630
Well yeah,
that,

816
00:39:11,631 --> 00:39:14,470
that would be for someone else.
Someone else.

817
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,360
Well hopefully no one would ever do
that.

818
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,660
Why not?
Well,

819
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,390
what killed him?
His is what we're doing.

820
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,750
I agree with you that we want,
we want to see what happens in humans.

821
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,040
Just give them like free pizza or
something.

822
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,110
They're on death row,
right?

823
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,760
If you're there already murders,
you want to be the first one to me on my

824
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,660
death row,
I don't want to go into death row,

825
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,730
but I'm saying if you're going to kill
somebody,

826
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,580
like wouldn't be a good idea to like,
oh hey,

827
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,100
we'll give you a four hours of tv a day.

828
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,120
So we want to shoot you up with some
stuff's going to make a younger.

829
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,420
If I was on death row and go do it.
See what's up.

830
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,620
I'll watch TV.
Well,

831
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:56,500
what we do is we give it all nice and we
check it.

832
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,740
What happens to their body.
So nursing home people to it,

833
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:00,770
to them.
Right.

834
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,100
Well tell you what,
I wouldn't force anyone,

835
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:08,101
but if somebody was blind or almost
blind and now studies were recovering

836
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:10,660
eyesight.
Really?

837
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,010
What about the damage to us?
Yeah.

838
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,153
Really?
Yeah.

839
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,150
Uh,
so I don't want to freak out because I

840
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:18,700
know a guy who's got significantly
damaged,

841
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:21,530
die from fighting.
Well,

842
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,880
I can tell you what we've done,
and this is work with writing up for

843
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,460
publication now.
We've done a few things.

844
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:29,560
Three things to the mice.
One is waived,

845
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:31,510
pinched their optic nerve and crushed
it,

846
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,350
which is a test for growing new neurons
in the eye.

847
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:40,140
And we find that without reprogramming,
we can make the nerves be just like a

848
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,770
newborn baby.
They grow back.

849
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,670
And then we also tested on glaucoma
pressure in the eye.

850
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,870
We increased pressure in the mouse as I.
and they lose their largely their

851
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:53,380
eyesight and we can recover that.
And then we also test old mice that

852
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:56,860
don't see very well and we also seem to
improve their eyesight almost back to

853
00:40:56,861 --> 00:40:58,540
normal.
So what,

854
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,940
I don't think we'll be going into
nursing homes anytime soon,

855
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:04,120
but what we are doing is running a
clinical trial on this.

856
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,460
Um,
and so we're looking to do that in early

857
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:10,810
20 slash 20 and the clinical trial will
be on people with glaucoma or various

858
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:13,990
eye issues.
The plan is glaucoma first,

859
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,410
but it could work for other damage
written as well.

860
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:20,110
Even broken spinal cords where we're
thinking of trying.

861
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,410
Wow.
And that's just one part of the body.

862
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,020
Imagine what it could potentially do to
the rest of them.

863
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:29,020
Do you feel incredibly fortunate to be
living in the century?

864
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,540
Uh,
I do every day,

865
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,750
but I would love to live next century
because it's going to be.

866
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:35,850
Yeah.
But you're,

867
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,820
what's cool is you're kind of at the,
the tip of the spear pushing this stuff

868
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:43,400
right now.
Like you're going to be one of the guys

869
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:46,820
that gets to see this stuff get
implemented from your actual own

870
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:49,800
research where it didn't exist before.
Uh,

871
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:51,110
yeah,
that's pretty damn cool.

872
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,650
Better than like living 100 years from
now where you just take it for granted.

873
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:57,640
Like a trust fund kid,
you know?

874
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,650
But just imagine what you can do in 100
years.

875
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,420
You can.
Well maybe you'll be here.

876
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,600
Were on the.
Yeah,

877
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:07,840
you might be 150.
We'll see.

878
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,620
I think there's a chance someone will
be.

879
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,460
Well,
it's,

880
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,760
it's a good chance you're going to be.
I mean you're the one who's going to

881
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:15,190
know.
Well.

882
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,030
So here's my philosophy.
I'm not gonna.

883
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,330
Let anyone try technology until I've
tried it first.

884
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,540
Really?
Is this a pause because you're,

885
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,860
you're currently doing something like
that.

886
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,770
I'm not doing the three programming yet.
That's a little dangerous.

887
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:33,020
But the others I've always wanted to
know first.

888
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:38,140
My eyesight is starting to go because
I'm 51 now and like when I had to read

889
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,410
this book,
I got a Nick Christakis book from

890
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:45,410
sitting here reading this book.
If I don't have reading glasses on,

891
00:42:45,411 --> 00:42:48,800
I got to do this.
It's a bit of a struggle to be able to

892
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:52,010
fix that.
So potentially in the mice we can,

893
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,600
you can,
we will.

894
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,120
We don't give them books to read,
but their eyesight improves.

895
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,500
We can test that.
How do you do it?

896
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,780
Uh,
there's a moving screen.

897
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,321
No,
I don't,

898
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:02,480
I don't mean how do you,
how do you know,

899
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:04,670
how do you test or not?
How you tests rather.

900
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:06,950
How do you improve their eyesight?
Uh,

901
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,020
we've,
we put these reprogramming genes into a

902
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:13,970
virus which has already used to treat
genetic diseases in the eye and we

903
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:15,800
inject it straight into the master's
level.

904
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,140
This sounds like the beginning of a
horror movie.

905
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,550
Yeah.
I think it's actually an awesome movie.

906
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,500
It's the awesome part that I'm focused
on.

907
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,730
Well,
if you're going blind,

908
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:28,130
right?
One injection from your doctor and then

909
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:30,500
you take an antibiotic,
turn the genes on for as long as you

910
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:34,280
need and you get your eyesight back.
That's not horrific at all.

911
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,020
That's a pretty incredible.
How far away do you think you are of

912
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:38,890
doing that to humans?
Well,

913
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,970
20,
20 will be the first safety study we.

914
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,210
Wow.
Yeah,

915
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,560
but the,
the crazy stuff,

916
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:49,400
the future is if this all goes well,
you have an injection in your vein,

917
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,480
let's say when you're 30 and in those
viruses infect your body and they sit

918
00:43:53,481 --> 00:43:56,450
there dormant until you need them,
so when might you need them?

919
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,000
You might have a car accident turned
them on,

920
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:03,410
can turn them on with just a,
an antibiotic in a drip or a pill,

921
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,160
or you start to lose your eyesight,
take it,

922
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,143
take an antibiotic.

923
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:12,110
So you put them in your body almost as
an insurance policy and then you have

924
00:44:12,111 --> 00:44:13,760
the option to turn them on in the
future.

925
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,320
Exactly.
Wow.

926
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,520
That's what we do in the mice.
Now with every action,

927
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:25,030
we assume there's some negative
consequence or potentially negative

928
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:27,920
consequence.
Right?

929
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,830
We always assume that,
but it's not always right.

930
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,390
So with the molecules that we've been
testing for years now,

931
00:44:35,391 --> 00:44:37,110
like can a man,
we haven't seen any downside,

932
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:41,100
just longer endurance and protection.
So there isn't always a downside to

933
00:44:41,101 --> 00:44:41,940
these things.
In fact,

934
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,840
if you just think nmn is replacing a
molecule that we lose over time as we

935
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:48,060
get older,
it's just becoming,

936
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,530
you know,
it's fairly natural process.

937
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,840
No downside exercising and dieting
either.

938
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:54,060
Right.
Of course.

939
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,660
And you said you run once a week.
Is that what you,

940
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,700
you and you do,
do you lift weights as well?

941
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,530
Right.
And when you do it,

942
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:05,820
do try to not go too hard or burn
yourself out too much?

943
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,790
Uh,
do you have a sweet spot?

944
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,043
Yeah.
Um,

945
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,880
I do,
I do,

946
00:45:11,881 --> 00:45:15,600
I try not to go too much.
I that that's the trick with everything

947
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:17,340
in life.
It's this,

948
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:18,360
uh,
hormesis effect.

949
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:22,080
Get your body damaged enough that it can
repair itself,

950
00:45:22,081 --> 00:45:27,081
but give you the benefits without like
having a lot of x rays or radiation.

951
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,230
We're doing it and scratching that CD.
Yeah.

952
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,300
My,
that's always my thought on people that

953
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:38,790
do extreme endurance activities like
ultra marathons and things along those

954
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:39,880
lines.
Um,

955
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:44,790
I mean I marvel at their willpower and
their ability to push themselves through

956
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:49,350
that and the physical condition they
have to be in to perform such feats.

957
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,820
But I always think,
man,

958
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:55,821
you're probably doing x times the amount
of damage to your body that a normal

959
00:45:56,581 --> 00:45:58,260
person does at your age.

960
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:00,480
It sounds right.
Calorie restriction works,

961
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:02,900
but if you overdo it,
you also starve you.

962
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:03,601
Yeah.
You Die.

963
00:46:03,601 --> 00:46:05,880
So you gotta find the right balance,
right?

964
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:06,930
Yeah.
How do you,

965
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:09,120
how do you know what the right balance
is for you?

966
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,640
Good question.
How does anybody,

967
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,620
um,
so we live in an age that is still

968
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,690
fairly primitive.
This is why I liked the future.

969
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,720
Um,
these days we go to the doctor or most

970
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:21,180
of us go to the doctor for annual
physical,

971
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,520
which is ludicrous.
The idea that your doctor will take

972
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,110
hopefully a blood test,
a prostate exam once a year.

973
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:30,420
That's kind of crazy.
What happens if you've got a tumor that

974
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:32,970
developed the day,
you leave the doctor's office.

975
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:36,210
So the future,
and actually partially for those who are

976
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:38,100
on the cutting edge can be done right
now.

977
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,650
It's monitoring your body in various
ways genetically,

978
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:44,910
epigenetically.

979
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,680
We can measure those scratches right
now.

980
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:52,070
And also with blood tests,
you can also have companies tell you if

981
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:55,200
you're out of range,
if you're not optimized and how to get

982
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:57,210
it back in order.
So that's what I do.

983
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,820
So how often do you monitor your blood?
Uh,

984
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,720
probably every few months.
I have a blood test from a company that

985
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,770
tells me what I need to correct and how
extensive it is.

986
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,710
Is this blood test like because it the
standard one that a normal person can

987
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:12,660
get or do you have to have a
prescription to get this or.

988
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,310
Oh No,
you can go online and get it.

989
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,240
Uh,
it's uh,

990
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,810
about I think 40 parameters they measure
some that are not standard that you're

991
00:47:18,811 --> 00:47:20,460
Dr wouldn't do.
Some are pretty standard.

992
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,440
Um,
but what's nice is it's,

993
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,050
it's a tracking system.
It's called inside tracker and they,

994
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,680
you can see over time if things are
going up and even if they're not out of

995
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:30,310
range yet,
you can see if they headed that

996
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:31,990
direction and correct it before it's too
late.

997
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,600
So that's why one of the reasons I'm on
Metformin,

998
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,250
my blood glucose was going up and up and
up,

999
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:41,550
which predicts lower life and some
metformin got it back down to where it

1000
00:47:42,121 --> 00:47:43,840
was optimal again.
So that's one of the things that

1001
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:46,060
metformin does,
is it lowers your blood glucose.

1002
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,160
That's what it's prescribed for,
for diabetics.

1003
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,950
Now,
does that have any effect on your energy

1004
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,660
levels?
Uh,

1005
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,490
I don't think so.
I haven't noticed that.

1006
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:00,370
Where you would notice it is during
rigorous exercise.

1007
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,500
That makes sense.
Do you feel it?

1008
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,180
Uh,
well,

1009
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,380
so I take metformin at night.
Um,

1010
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,550
so that may be probably the best thing.
Right?

1011
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:12,610
So when you're sleeping it's having its
effect and it's run its course by the

1012
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:13,570
time you wake up,
you believe?

1013
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:14,670
Yeah.
Hmm.

1014
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,410
Um,
now when you are exercising,

1015
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:21,730
are you exercising fasted or do you take
certain amount of carbohydrates for you?

1016
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,310
Do any kind of physical exercise?
Uh,

1017
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:25,560
so I started the gym,
uh,

1018
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,130
two,
2:00 PM on a Sunday and I'll have a

1019
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:32,640
salad rapper or something like that.
So I'm not feeling hungry during it and

1020
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,630
one pass out.
Huh?

1021
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:39,040
And um,
so I understand that you're getting

1022
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,860
these blood tests,
but do you have a trainer?

1023
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,310
Do you,
do you set a workout or you structure

1024
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,660
it?
I do now.

1025
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,760
Just recently got a trainer.

1026
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,100
Um,
it's great thing to do with your son,

1027
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,170
father,
son time.

1028
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,660
So yeah,
that we have an hour of trainer and then

1029
00:48:55,661 --> 00:48:57,640
we,
we also do a bit of boxing.

1030
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,120
Um,
and you're beating yourself up.

1031
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,053
Yeah,
it's fun.

1032
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,390
It's legal.
I think go to the sauna and then there's

1033
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,320
just the best way to spend a day.
That is a nice way to spend a day.

1034
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,090
So I'm a you,
how many days a week you're doing this

1035
00:49:12,091 --> 00:49:14,140
or do you give yourself days off?
Do you,

1036
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,170
you schedule that?
Well,

1037
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,560
so once a day of that are once a week on
a Sunday and during the week if I have a

1038
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:22,900
chance and I'm not traveling,
I go to the home gym.

1039
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,160
And when you say you run once a week,
is that by design that you only give

1040
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:30,190
yourself once a week?
I'd probably run two times a week.

1041
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,640
A high intensity,
um,

1042
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,530
if I could.
And I try to do that often I'm on a

1043
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,920
plane or right,
and we say high intensity or you

1044
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:41,650
sprinting doing track work.
Like what kind of stuff?

1045
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,870
Yeah,
so I'm not an expert,

1046
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,560
so what I do is I.
I will spend or have spent a half an

1047
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:50,230
hour on one of those treadmills that's u
shaped.

1048
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,910
Yeah,
I got one of those out of here.

1049
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:52,803
Yeah.
Great.

1050
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,520
They are so that you determine your
speed.

1051
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:56,340
So I'll,
I'll sprint and then I'll slow down and

1052
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:58,720
sprint slow down.
There are actually more difficult than

1053
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:03,490
running on a flat surface where a
regular treadmills is actually easier

1054
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:06,220
than running because the treadmills
moving and you just kind of lifting your

1055
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:09,310
legs up and keeping moving.
With this actually you're powering it.

1056
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:13,270
So by you pushing on it,
it's actually more.

1057
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,230
It's like running.

1058
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,800
I forget what the degree incline is,
but it's like an x,

1059
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,110
x amount percentage harder than a
regular run.

1060
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:22,690
Oh good.
Well that's what feels good to me.

1061
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:26,410
And although it's a little bit scary if
you're not used to these treadmills,

1062
00:50:26,411 --> 00:50:28,910
you can run off the front because they
are free flowing.

1063
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,880
Go right off the tip.
They have handles.

1064
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,950
Oh yeah,
you're a genius.

1065
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:36,050
You're not going to go flying off the
treadmill like a dummy.

1066
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,870
I'm no genius.
Especially when it comes to sport.

1067
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,460
Well,
yeah,

1068
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,450
the album,
I'm a big fan of those things and it's

1069
00:50:44,451 --> 00:50:46,850
nice too because there's a lot of give
to them.

1070
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,070
There's not much pounding when you run
on those.

1071
00:50:49,071 --> 00:50:52,670
It's not like running on hard surfaces.
So I try to go easy on my joints.

1072
00:50:52,671 --> 00:50:57,671
I've seen you've probably all seen
sports players with all sorts of damage

1073
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,260
that joints and I've done all of it.

1074
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

1075
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:03,230
So yeah,
low impact,

1076
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:06,970
high intensity and it as far as weight
lifting,

1077
00:51:06,971 --> 00:51:09,620
we will kind of stuff you do in there
because weightlifting does have a

1078
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:14,650
beneficial effect on bone density and
it's supposedly has an effect on anti

1079
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:16,540
aging as well.
Uh,

1080
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:19,400
yeah,
absolutely believe in that until I try

1081
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:23,030
to maintain some muscle mass.
It's good for burning fat too.

1082
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,380
So,
you know,

1083
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:28,670
I tried to do a not go overboard with
the bench presses and otherwise I'll

1084
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,910
have even more well rounded shoulders
trying to get the straight back.

1085
00:51:31,911 --> 00:51:34,640
So the trainer is helping me bring my
body back into shape.

1086
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,660
He took one look at me and he said,
you,

1087
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:41,270
you,
you did this unsupervised direct your

1088
00:51:41,271 --> 00:51:42,980
body in your twenties.
Let's try to fix that.

1089
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,610
What did he say you were doing wrong?
Uh,

1090
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,281
I said,
well,

1091
00:51:46,281 --> 00:51:48,680
why would you do an exercise and a part
of your body you can't see in the

1092
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:49,040
mirror?

1093
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,873
Oh,
your back.

1094
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:53,300
My back is flimsy and it's all here.
So I stand like,

1095
00:51:53,301 --> 00:51:56,270
you're a smart man.
It's protecting your spine.

1096
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,970
I love benchpressing.
Oh God.

1097
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:03,230
Please don't use
your shoulders out too though,

1098
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:04,370
right?
Oh yeah.

1099
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,350
Yeah.
Especially if you do it heavy.

1100
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,290
Now I'm you do this.
How many days a week?

1101
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,650
Hopefully two or three.
Two or three a week.

1102
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:15,260
So all the,
everything you're doing you would

1103
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:17,180
essentially recommend to others as well.
Right?

1104
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:20,090
So you think that's a good plan?
Two to three days a week of

1105
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:21,410
weightlifting.
One to two days.

1106
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:26,411
A week of running sauna when you can.
So I never used the word recommend gets

1107
00:52:27,681 --> 00:52:28,491
me into trouble.
Yeah,

1108
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:30,620
good move.
I just say what I do and people can

1109
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:34,190
judge but as smart,
but the science does say this is the

1110
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:36,680
optimal and that's why I've chosen it
for myself,

1111
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,750
but I think without monitoring yourself
easy to overdo it and also you just

1112
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,400
really don't know what's going on in the
inside.

1113
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:48,110
It's crazy to think we know more about
our cars as we drive on the dashboard

1114
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:51,360
then we do about our bodies.
How does anybody know if the exercises

1115
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,780
too much,
too little or if that supplements doing

1116
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:56,570
anything right with that is a big
problem.

1117
00:52:56,571 --> 00:52:58,560
Right?
I mean one of the things that we have a

1118
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,670
giant problem in mma is tainted
supplements.

1119
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,510
People buying supplements.
The supplements have other things in

1120
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:06,344
them.
And

1121
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,840
what are you drinking?
Do you drink mostly water to consume

1122
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:13,790
caffeine?
Uh,

1123
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:16,430
so with Nmn,
which gives me a boost,

1124
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,960
I think caffeine is a little too
intense,

1125
00:53:18,961 --> 00:53:23,090
so I find that.
So I'll have a cup of coffee in the

1126
00:53:23,091 --> 00:53:25,380
morning,
but that's it one a day.

1127
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:26,460
Yeah.

1128
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,241
Wow.
Yeah.

1129
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:29,610
Just to kick it to live,
it's hard.

1130
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,750
It's really hard,
right?

1131
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:34,890
When you're doing research all the time,
don't you need a little boost sometimes?

1132
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:35,560
Well,
I,

1133
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:40,560
I do drink a diet coke or how dare you
just ruined everything.

1134
00:53:40,891 --> 00:53:42,870
You said you're doing that?
Yeah.

1135
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:45,880
It's my fucking horrible for you.
Is it that bad?

1136
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,010
Aspartame?
Well,

1137
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:52,700
I actually had an inflated idea of how
bad it was apparently talking to another

1138
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,710
research scientist,
uh,

1139
00:53:55,711 --> 00:54:00,711
he was telling me that the actual amount
that they gave to rats when they're

1140
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:06,710
diagnosing them with cancer is almost
impossible for a person to consume.

1141
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:12,300
So you'd have to have ungodly amounts of
aspartame in order to get these effects

1142
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:14,730
that everyone's terrified of.
You said the other thing to take into

1143
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:18,510
consideration is look around at how many
people are drinking diet coke?

1144
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,190
He goes,
it was really that bad.

1145
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:24,840
They'd be dropping like flies.
The consideration though is upsetting

1146
00:54:24,841 --> 00:54:27,080
your gut biome,
right?

1147
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,890
That I know,
or at least I've read,

1148
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,100
but he said that's also probably large
quantities.

1149
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,070
Uh,
it's true.

1150
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:35,701
Uh,
but,

1151
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:36,271
uh,
as you know,

1152
00:54:36,271 --> 00:54:39,540
the microbiome is a finicky thing and
you don't want to mess with that.

1153
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,730
The reason I have this,
this yoga in the morning,

1154
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:43,930
trying to reset the thing.
D,

1155
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:45,520
Kim all.
Uh,

1156
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,710
yeah.
Not regularly,

1157
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:47,540
but yeah,
that's,

1158
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,130
that's

1159
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:51,430
what about other fermented vegetables or
anything along those lines.

1160
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,600
The probiotic

1161
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:57,240
Japanese food into.
But I don't think about my diet that

1162
00:54:57,241 --> 00:55:00,030
often.
Usually too busy running around.

1163
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:00,750
But

1164
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:04,140
now have you ever messed around with
nootropics or anything like that to

1165
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,250
enhance your mental clarity or boost
your brain power?

1166
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,730
W?
Well,

1167
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:11,600
yeah.
My,

1168
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,130
my brain is always running a marathon.
Right?

1169
00:55:14,131 --> 00:55:17,610
That's my career.
I definitely noticed that if I take time

1170
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:21,420
off even a weekend without thinking I'm
dumber on Monday,

1171
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,250
dumber.
Well yeah,

1172
00:55:23,251 --> 00:55:26,190
I just can't really.
So like it's almost like you need to

1173
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:29,180
keep that pace going for sure.
Oh,

1174
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,083
right,
right.

1175
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,840
I guess I'm not a natural genius.
I have to work at it,

1176
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,050
but I do find that that constant
stimulation,

1177
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:39,990
I've got to do that to be at the peak.
And this is the APP.

1178
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:43,530
This is the genetics department at
Harvard medical school and these are no

1179
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:44,090
dummies.
These,

1180
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,160
a quarter of them,
a Nobel prize winners.

1181
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,510
And you got to.
I'm going to load the science,

1182
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:52,260
we published the world's top journals,
which you really get into,

1183
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:56,430
so to be able to think of these ideas
and come up with new things,

1184
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,370
you can't just do that on a,
on a whim.

1185
00:55:59,371 --> 00:56:03,360
You really have to have a mind that is
focused and in shape.

1186
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,560
Exactly.
Yeah.

1187
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,720
So it is essentially you feel like
running,

1188
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,600
like you would take days off.
He actually slipped back a little bit

1189
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:11,100
and then you have to ramp back up to
speed.

1190
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,840
It's horrible.
I really hate it.

1191
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,490
But is it just because you just get used
to a lazy pace and you have to like

1192
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,870
acclimate to get back in the lab or is
it actually you do get dumber?

1193
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,310
Um,
I don't have the memory recall.

1194
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:24,910
Uh,
I,

1195
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:29,180
I feel like I did when I was in my
twenties,

1196
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:32,230
which is I wasn't as sharp.
I'm a lot sharper than I was then.

1197
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:36,250
So part of it could be the mental
training that I give myself every,

1198
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,920
every day.
The other part could be that the

1199
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:43,390
molecules that I'm taking,
so nmn raising nad could have neurotoxic

1200
00:56:43,391 --> 00:56:44,440
effects.
We don't know.

1201
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:47,020
Yeah,
I'm sure I'm creatine supposedly has

1202
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:49,120
nootropic effects as well.
Do you ever take that?

1203
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:53,020
No.
Caffeine certainly does.

1204
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,150
I'd like to get you some actual
nootropics.

1205
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:57,460
I'll send you some.
There's a bunch of different ones that I

1206
00:56:57,461 --> 00:56:59,740
use.
I use three different companies.

1207
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:02,500
One that's one of mine and uh,
to the other companies,

1208
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:06,760
neuro one and another one called true
brain and I find them pretty beneficial.

1209
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,500
Right?
I could do with that.

1210
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,390
Yeah,
it,

1211
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:10,660
it'll definitely.
Well,

1212
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,240
the one that we've tested was Alpha
brain.

1213
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,030
We tested the Boston Center for memory.
They did a double blind.

1214
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:19,270
Placebo controlled study showed increase
in verbal memory,

1215
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,190
increased reaction,
speed,

1216
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,870
reaction time.
Um,

1217
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:25,150
but the,
the other ones,

1218
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,250
Prasad,
to them of your mess with any of those,

1219
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,550
know Coleen,
your supplement with that.

1220
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,020
No.
Interesting.

1221
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:34,690
Right?
I could be smarter I guess.

1222
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,410
Well,
this,

1223
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,790
I don't think it's that.
It's just,

1224
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,450
it's not smarter.
It's,

1225
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:40,570
I don't think anything makes you
smarter.

1226
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,050
I think knowledge makes you smarter.
What it does is gives you access,

1227
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,990
I think,
to something that's already in your

1228
00:57:46,991 --> 00:57:47,830
head.
Good,

1229
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,390
little bit,
little smoother.

1230
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,110
Good recall is important.
The other thing as a scientist,

1231
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:58,030
what you need is you need to see a
thousand different sets of data and put

1232
00:57:58,031 --> 00:58:00,220
them into one.
They can see the connections.

1233
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:04,570
So I'm exposed to so much information.
It's drinking from a fire hose every

1234
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:05,231
day.
I'm reading papers,

1235
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:08,920
I'm talking to dozens of people,
have got dozens of companies,

1236
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,660
got two labs in the world.

1237
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,390
It's just coming in and for my brain to
take it in,

1238
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,420
sorted out,
finds links between them,

1239
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,490
connect that person with that
politician,

1240
00:58:18,491 --> 00:58:21,520
with that person in the military.
It's all going on.

1241
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:25,180
And a regular brain that isn't trained
would have a hard time.

1242
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,350
Yeah,
I would imagine.

1243
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:30,490
I'm so shocked the only drink one cup of
coffee a day with that kind of schedule.

1244
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,230
Uh,
well.

1245
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,640
So the sentiment is good.
Um,

1246
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,600
do you take nad in an Ivy for?
No,

1247
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:37,930
no,
I've,

1248
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,900
I haven't,
but I've talked to many people that have

1249
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,620
been scheduling it or wanting to
schedule it and putting it off for

1250
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,180
weeks.
But uh,

1251
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,690
I'm going to do that soon because I just
know too many people that have extreme

1252
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:51,790
benefits from it.
Yeah,

1253
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,870
sounds good.
Um,

1254
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,880
do you know anyone who has done it?
No,

1255
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:58,420
that seems like something will be right
up your alley.

1256
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:00,641
A.
Yeah,

1257
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:03,220
you'd think just being more focused on
curing aging,

1258
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:08,200
but nad does have supposedly some sort
of an effect on aging.

1259
00:59:08,201 --> 00:59:12,400
Correct.
Ivy Nad I don't know about an ivy nad

1260
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,240
it's been poorly studied,
actually has a lot of anecdotes and I

1261
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:20,250
hear about these all the time but I
haven't seen really a hardcore double

1262
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:21,943
blind placebo

1263
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,660
controlled trials now.
And add in supplemental form though in

1264
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:30,380
terms of oral orally ingested any day a
well.

1265
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,650
So if you give an a to an animal or a
cell,

1266
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,190
it taken up really poorly.
Nad is a big molecule.

1267
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:41,420
NMN is a smaller version of ned that
gets into cells quickly.

1268
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,570
So that's probably a difference.
Ah.

1269
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:49,600
So it's the same benefit but it's easier
consumed orally?

1270
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,180
Well I think so.
I mean it was still at the cutting edge

1271
00:59:53,181 --> 00:59:54,590
of figuring out what's true and what
isn't.

1272
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:59,591
But Nad is thought to not be well
absorbed in the body as compared to

1273
01:00:00,201 --> 01:00:03,680
these other smaller molecules that the
body then turns into nad once it gets

1274
01:00:03,681 --> 01:00:06,080
in,
how much water do you drink?

1275
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,910
Not Enough.
Not Enough.

1276
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:12,110
I was just speaking with um,
some members of Tom Come Brady's team

1277
01:00:12,111 --> 01:00:12,921
and they said,
David,

1278
01:00:12,921 --> 01:00:14,960
you got to drink more.
Tom Brady's team.

1279
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,393
I,
yeah.

1280
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,540
You mean is like physical team,
like the Patriots now,

1281
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:20,971
uh,
his,

1282
01:00:20,971 --> 01:00:23,480
uh,
his CEO of his company.

1283
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:24,561
Oh,
okay.

1284
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:26,720
And they're saying you need to drink
more and you went and got to see.

1285
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:29,390
It's like a suggestion.
I'm drinking,

1286
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:32,530
I'm drinking a lot more.
All right.

1287
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,150
Then you end up just going to the
bathroom off the time,

1288
01:00:35,151 --> 01:00:35,750
but,
uh,

1289
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,970
got to do what you gotta do you do,
you do.

1290
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:41,960
It makes sense to me having a buildup of
toxins in your body and urea isn't a

1291
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:42,794
good thing.
Right?

1292
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:47,320
Um,
do you take anything else that,

1293
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:48,380
uh,
is notable?

1294
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,660
Well,
I can run you through it.

1295
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:56,510
I'm on Lippert note a Staton for.
I've been on staten since I was in my

1296
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:58,370
twenties.
Oh yeah.

1297
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:01,850
Uh,
that stuff's fucking terrible for you.

1298
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,930
Uh,
right.

1299
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:07,970
So my good friend and colleague George
Church at Harvard told me I'm killing

1300
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:10,190
myself,
but I have really high cholesterol.

1301
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,070
My family genetically.
Genetically.

1302
01:01:12,071 --> 01:01:13,050
Yeah.
And um,

1303
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,740
does your family have a history of heart
disease because of this?

1304
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:16,970
Yeah.
So my grandmother,

1305
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,770
um,
at least according to her had a stroke

1306
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:21,620
in her thirties and then yeah,
it's bad.

1307
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:24,680
So I'm fighting bad Ashkenazi Jew jeans
here.

1308
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:29,510
That's crazy.
He'd been on them since you're in your

1309
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:31,400
twenties,
that's in your thin man.

1310
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,530
If anybody looked at you,
they would never think that you would

1311
01:01:33,531 --> 01:01:35,360
have an issue.
Yeah,

1312
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:36,640
it's unfortunate,
but I'm,

1313
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,650
I'm a doctor's worst nightmare first of
all,

1314
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:42,050
I teach them so I know what they're
like.

1315
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,940
Uh,
but also when I go into the doctor's

1316
01:01:43,941 --> 01:01:46,370
office I say,
here's what we should be doing.

1317
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,920
Well you should be doing to me.
And I saw,

1318
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:51,500
I went in my twenties and I said,
I want to go into status and this is in

1319
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:55,220
the days when statens weren't well
studied and my doctor said,

1320
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,900
but you're not old.
And I said,

1321
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,890
I don't want to wait until I'm old and
sick to get this medicine.

1322
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:02,660
I need it now.
And I fought the doctor foot,

1323
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,690
the doctor,
and eventually he prescribed it and my

1324
01:02:05,691 --> 01:02:07,110
cholesterol came down.
Uh,

1325
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:10,310
I'm the same with dentists.
I went to the dentist a few months ago

1326
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:12,200
and I said,
I want my teeth fixed,

1327
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:16,010
my two front teeth.
And she said they find normal wear and

1328
01:02:16,011 --> 01:02:16,510
tear.
And I said,

1329
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:17,343
okay,
what's normal?

1330
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,010
Fixed my teeth.
Get them back to how I was when I was

1331
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,401
20.
No,

1332
01:02:20,401 --> 01:02:21,390
we don't do that.
We don't do that.

1333
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,060
Well,
you did my daughter right last week.

1334
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,590
Yeah.
But she's young.

1335
01:02:25,591 --> 01:02:27,150
She's got a future.
Like,

1336
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:31,350
oh see done.
Don't be wrong with your teeth are

1337
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:33,540
wearing out.
And I hated feeling that one out.

1338
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,660
I'm wearing cow.
You don't get that way.

1339
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:39,300
Uh,
just getting shorter and flatter and

1340
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:44,301
what the fuck you eat and rocks.
I must be the Australian Diet.

1341
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,570
A lot of sand in your food.
So I said to her,

1342
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:50,810
I thought you were one of the world's
best dentist.

1343
01:02:50,811 --> 01:02:52,560
And she said,
okay,

1344
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:53,610
fine,
I'll do it.

1345
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,710
But don't blame me if it doesn't work.
Um,

1346
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,460
and so she works like,
well,

1347
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:02,910
she was worried that it might snap off
or putting a cap on you.

1348
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:04,930
Yeah,
she's extending my two front teeth were

1349
01:03:04,931 --> 01:03:08,160
just normal,
like people get caps all the time.

1350
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:08,490
I.

1351
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:11,930
Well it's not a cap.
It's actually just material stuck to the

1352
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:16,370
tape just on the tip.
It's also like if you had a chip too,

1353
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,150
they would do that instead of replace
the actual.

1354
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,400
That's what I did to my daughter and I
said,

1355
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:21,570
do that to me.
That looks great.

1356
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:22,620
And she said,
no,

1357
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:22,980
no,
no.

1358
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,000
Finally she said,
okay,

1359
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:25,980
but it's your problem.
You got to pay for it.

1360
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:27,580
Fine.
Uh,

1361
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,970
and she did it and she actually said at
the end of it,

1362
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:32,940
this is great.
I might offer this as a procedure to

1363
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:36,160
other patients,
but.

1364
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:40,860
But my point is not about teeth,
it's the medical profession is ageist.

1365
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,170
They give young people certain
treatments because they're young and

1366
01:03:43,171 --> 01:03:45,660
they don't give them to the old,
but then they don't give the young

1367
01:03:45,661 --> 01:03:47,940
people the treatments that they need
before they get old.

1368
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:51,510
Wacky.
I had a similar thing happened with a

1369
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:54,930
torn meniscus,
a minor meniscus tear,

1370
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,710
and the guy told me,
well if you were young,

1371
01:03:58,711 --> 01:04:01,740
they would stitch it up and hope that it
would heal.

1372
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:03,720
I'm like,
what the fuck does that mean?

1373
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:05,910
I go,
everything works good.

1374
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:09,420
Like what is different?
What is the difference between me and a

1375
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:12,210
younger body of.
And he said something about blood flow,

1376
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:14,310
you have more blood flow.
And I said,

1377
01:04:14,311 --> 01:04:15,690
look,
I'm not a doctor but that doesn't make

1378
01:04:15,691 --> 01:04:17,190
any sense.
I go,

1379
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,710
I'm working out all the time.
There's a lot of blood going through

1380
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,390
there,
like what the fuck is happening?

1381
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:24,720
And I'm like let's just shoot some stem
cells in there and see what's up because

1382
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:29,670
they wanted to do a meniscus.
The

1383
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,630
meniscus copy,
whatever they call it when they cut some

1384
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:36,030
of the meniscus out and I'm like,
Eh,

1385
01:04:36,031 --> 01:04:37,840
let's just,
let's just try it.

1386
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:41,130
It's totally working like A.
I don't have any pain in it now.

1387
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:46,320
So I think there's a weird thing that
they do do when you get to a certain

1388
01:04:46,321 --> 01:04:47,154
age,
like Eh,

1389
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,040
like I have a friend who was a torn acl
and they essentially,

1390
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:52,380
he's in his fifties,
late fifties,

1391
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:54,540
and they essentially told not to fix it.

1392
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,650
I go,
Hey fucker,

1393
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:57,300
get it fixed.
What are you crazy?

1394
01:04:57,301 --> 01:04:59,490
And I have a wobbly knee.
And they're like,

1395
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:00,990
well,
they told me if I was younger,

1396
01:05:00,991 --> 01:05:04,140
did I fuck that doctor?
Go get that thing fixed.

1397
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,060
He's like,
well how the recovery time?

1398
01:05:06,061 --> 01:05:08,730
Like shut up,
you just recover.

1399
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,160
You're alive.
A year goes by,

1400
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:12,570
it's fixed.
Just stop.

1401
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:14,100
Just go get it fixed.
Yeah.

1402
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,700
See that's the problem with today's
society because we think a 50 old is

1403
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:22,210
dale that's dead at 50 is still very
young.

1404
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:24,550
Actually there are 78,
70 year old 80 year olds,

1405
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:27,400
nine year olds still playing tennis,
loving life.

1406
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:29,170
That's,
that's just the beginning of what's

1407
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:31,930
coming.
If you maintain activity that that seems

1408
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:34,750
to be the key.
The the really hard thing is when

1409
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:38,350
someone's in their fifties and they want
to get in shape now and they haven't

1410
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,090
been active their whole life,
that seems to be a problem.

1411
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,450
Their DVD is scratched up.
Yes.

1412
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:46,150
Hard to go back.
It can be done though.

1413
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:51,630
I did see a guy who was 58 years old who
started running marathons at 58 in his

1414
01:05:52,691 --> 01:05:55,750
seventies.
He's running a sub three hour marathons

1415
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:58,460
and he looks great,
so it just.

1416
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:03,510
He just had to take his time and really
be dedicated and watch his diet,

1417
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:06,280
nutrition and next thing you know,
this guy's an elite marathon runner.

1418
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,640
It is doable.
What we find in the lab is if we treat

1419
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:12,250
mice early in life,
it gives them the battle much better

1420
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:12,790
life.
Spanish,

1421
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:15,220
sure.
So don't ever leave it too late.

1422
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:19,630
Will you see that with athletes like
athletes that were fit when they were

1423
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:23,950
young and never lost it,
really maintained and stayed in the gym

1424
01:06:23,951 --> 01:06:26,500
and stayed active.
You see them in their fifties and

1425
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,710
sixties looking great.
Whereas you know,

1426
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,920
it's just once your body deteriorates,
it's very difficult to bring it back.

1427
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:39,160
But if you maintain it,
it seems like there's people today that

1428
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,800
are doing that.
It's much more common if you go to a

1429
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:42,820
gym,
for instance,

1430
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,640
go to a nice gym,
you'll see a lot of folks that are in

1431
01:06:45,641 --> 01:06:49,060
their sixties and seventies that are
really active and they're there all the

1432
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:51,580
time and they're regulars had the gym
and they look great.

1433
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:54,130
They do.
So my father is a,

1434
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:57,190
as a prime example of that.
So he's in Australia and he's been

1435
01:06:57,191 --> 01:07:00,820
taking care of his body since he was in
his early forties.

1436
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:06,310
Probably a little too late,
but still he's been taking metformin for

1437
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:07,510
awhile.
Resveratrol.

1438
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,090
But he's been active.
That's the key,

1439
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:11,080
I think.
And then,

1440
01:07:11,081 --> 01:07:12,220
uh,
so that combination.

1441
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:17,170
So he's now just turning 80 this year.
You would think that he's 30 if you,

1442
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:20,980
if you didn't know his age and he's
running around.

1443
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,650
My mother passed away from cancer.
So he's,

1444
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,900
he's dating women.
He's out every night.

1445
01:07:25,901 --> 01:07:28,750
He's traveling the world now.
This is the future for,

1446
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,430
for people in their eighties.
Um,

1447
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:36,570
he started a new career at 80.
It was at a 76.

1448
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,140
What's he doing?
He got bored,

1449
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:42,340
so he retired at 67,
thought he hadn't now the 10 years of

1450
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:44,200
goodlife and he kept going and going,
going.

1451
01:07:44,201 --> 01:07:46,150
His friends are getting frail.
He's still active,

1452
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:51,370
so he went back and he's working at
Sydney University on the ethics panel

1453
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,480
for clinical trials and other studies
and that's what you want older people

1454
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,850
with wisdom and knowledge to do,
to give back.

1455
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,790
That sounds good too.
Like for you,

1456
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,780
you get your dad hopped up on all these
awesome new drugs.

1457
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:09,430
Then you get them working on the ethics
panel for clinical studies and then you

1458
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:13,990
get them to give you some death row
patients so you can try it on.

1459
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:14,920
Right.
Ethics,

1460
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,010
you're onto me.

1461
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,900
Yes,
I know what you're doing now man.

1462
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,970
You're wiggling the system a little bit
with your.

1463
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:21,740
Keep it in the family.
Hyper active,

1464
01:08:21,741 --> 01:08:23,690
super healthy dad.
Right?

1465
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,340
Well,
I don't recommend anything even to my

1466
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:27,440
family,
but they end up to mending it.

1467
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,260
My brother was pretty upset that we
weren't giving him any.

1468
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,290
Well,
it seems like it's working out really

1469
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:34,820
well for your father.
I mean,

1470
01:08:34,821 --> 01:08:39,821
so metformin,
the Nmm and what else is he taking a,

1471
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:44,020
he's also on a Staton and he exercises.
That's amazing.

1472
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:47,270
So he's understanding as well because he
has the same predisposed condition,

1473
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,910
right?
That's an awful condition,

1474
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:50,281
man.
That,

1475
01:08:50,281 --> 01:08:52,040
that may mean.
One of the things that I was talking to

1476
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:56,330
my doctor about it,
he was saying that that there are people

1477
01:08:56,331 --> 01:08:59,000
that just have high blood pressure or
higher,

1478
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,700
you know,
higher blood pressure,

1479
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:04,370
higher instances of heart disease and
their family and it's just a really

1480
01:09:04,371 --> 01:09:06,440
unfortunate genetic issue.

1481
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:08,330
Uh,
it is,

1482
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,850
it is.
But fortunately we were able to tackle

1483
01:09:10,851 --> 01:09:13,940
heart disease pretty well these days
with blood pressure,

1484
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:14,810
drugs,
cholesterol,

1485
01:09:14,811 --> 01:09:16,430
drugs.
There were some side effects,

1486
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:18,980
no question.
But what we're talking about with these

1487
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,880
longevity drugs that are in development
is that sure you can be prescribed this

1488
01:09:22,881 --> 01:09:25,430
medicine for your Alzheimer's or fewer
liver disease,

1489
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,460
but as a side effect,
it'll keep the rest of your body healthy

1490
01:09:28,461 --> 01:09:30,560
as well.
Protect you against cancer and all these

1491
01:09:30,561 --> 01:09:32,420
other things.
That's what's so radical,

1492
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:35,830
what we're doing
now.

1493
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:40,330
Um,
what about crispr and what do you think

1494
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:45,190
a is going to come out of that in terms
of like real world application for an

1495
01:09:45,191 --> 01:09:46,420
adult?
I mean,

1496
01:09:46,421 --> 01:09:48,220
what if people don't know what Crispr
is?

1497
01:09:48,221 --> 01:09:51,010
Please explain it in layman's terms.

1498
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:51,761
Uh,
yeah,

1499
01:09:51,761 --> 01:09:56,080
so crispr is a term that was invented in
my department probably,

1500
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:59,380
so I know it pretty well.
It's a back bacteria,

1501
01:09:59,381 --> 01:10:01,780
have an immune system that cuts
invaders,

1502
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:05,530
cut the DNA and what we've done now as
scientists,

1503
01:10:05,531 --> 01:10:09,520
we've now utilize that system,
take it out of the bacteria and we use

1504
01:10:09,521 --> 01:10:13,960
it to create designer mutations,
design a gene,

1505
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:18,961
changes in animals and also in humans.
So it's a bacterial immune system that

1506
01:10:20,081 --> 01:10:22,900
corrects genes and we use it all the
time now.

1507
01:10:22,901 --> 01:10:23,734
It's um,
it's,

1508
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:27,130
it's actually what's interesting about
is being able to mutate genes for many

1509
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:29,770
years,
but this is dial up a gene mutation.

1510
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,810
You can choose exactly where you want to
make it.

1511
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:34,600
And uh,
so I think many of your listeners will

1512
01:10:34,601 --> 01:10:37,630
know that recently,
a late last year,

1513
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:42,160
Chinese researcher and our field came
out and said he's engineered a couple of

1514
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:46,960
twin girls with crispr to be resistant
to HIV AIDS virus.

1515
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,050
Wow.
Um,

1516
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,650
if they're telling you that when you got
to think they're doing some stuff

1517
01:10:52,651 --> 01:10:54,080
they're not telling you about,
right?

1518
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:55,130
Well,
yeah.

1519
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:58,970
Have some kids with giant heads and.
Well it's coming through walls.

1520
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:00,110
Rewind.

1521
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:04,730
Well yeah,
if you start to see people that are 90

1522
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:07,060
and they're still as young as 20,
you know,

1523
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:08,360
something's going on.
Yeah.

1524
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:09,194
That's the weird

1525
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,000
one,
right?

1526
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,310
If you can,
you'd go,

1527
01:11:12,311 --> 01:11:13,050
Hey,
what are you doing?

1528
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,150
Nothing.
Just eating

1529
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,020
healthy looking good.
Take care of bots.

1530
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,420
Not going to tell you.
Yeah,

1531
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:18,781
yeah.
Well,

1532
01:11:18,781 --> 01:11:19,960
so consider this,
that.

1533
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:22,570
So the chance of getting HIV in China is
one in a thousand.

1534
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:27,180
So that doctor was seemingly,
he thought he was ethical,

1535
01:11:27,181 --> 01:11:28,830
protecting the babies from something
that's,

1536
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:33,180
I would say really rare.
Whereas if you really wanted to do

1537
01:11:33,181 --> 01:11:37,170
something helpful to those kids and we
agreed it was something you should do,

1538
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:40,380
why not make them resistant to heart
disease or cancer?

1539
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:43,680
We can do that.
It was weird that he chose HIV as the

1540
01:11:43,681 --> 01:11:45,780
first test.
Why do you think they did that?

1541
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,650
Um,
I think because it was a very well

1542
01:11:49,651 --> 01:11:53,340
understood mutation that would,
if you just destroyed the gene,

1543
01:11:53,341 --> 01:11:55,710
it would work.
Whereas with these other diseases,

1544
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:58,920
you have to be much more precise.
But the reason that we scientists got

1545
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:03,720
really upset was that he did it in
secrecy and then just launched it on the

1546
01:12:03,721 --> 01:12:07,650
world and that kind of thing because
it's a fine line in ethics.

1547
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:11,400
You want to be doing that with total
transparency running.

1548
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:16,850
I think he was hoping to become a win a
Nobel prize or be a star and it,

1549
01:12:17,251 --> 01:12:20,610
it backfired on him because he,
he just did it in secrecy.

1550
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:23,150
It backfired in the scientific
community.

1551
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,320
Absolutely.
In the real world,

1552
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:28,380
in the media,
I was shocked how little discussion

1553
01:12:28,381 --> 01:12:30,330
there was.
If this news came out in the two

1554
01:12:30,331 --> 01:12:32,230
thousands during the Bush era,
it would,

1555
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:34,080
there would have been panels,
investigations,

1556
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:35,550
it would have been in the news for
months,

1557
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,100
but it wasn't.
People went,

1558
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:38,820
Ahhh.
What's next on twitter?

1559
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,530
Do you think?
It's just because of the news cycle.

1560
01:12:40,531 --> 01:12:42,060
So insane.
I do.

1561
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,470
Yeah.
Um,

1562
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:48,780
when you have a scientific experiment of
that nature,

1563
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:52,230
what's the standard protocol for a
scientist?

1564
01:12:52,231 --> 01:12:56,430
Whether it is or is it the same in China
and in Russia and the United States as a

1565
01:12:56,431 --> 01:13:01,431
scientific community almost operate
under different,

1566
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:04,830
like a different set of rules than
anything else.

1567
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:08,170
You mean between countries or.
I mean,

1568
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,950
you know,
like obviously technology is not shared

1569
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:14,610
like China is doing something
technologically.

1570
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:17,760
United States is,
we have to speculate,

1571
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:20,520
we have to figure it out.
But when it comes to medical science,

1572
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:23,370
right,
is it sort of an open book because

1573
01:13:23,371 --> 01:13:28,371
everybody sharing information a no,
or at least alerting everyone to what

1574
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:29,940
they're working on or.
Well,

1575
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,330
I know where you're going with this.
At least I think I do.

1576
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:34,401
Uh,
yeah.

1577
01:13:34,401 --> 01:13:37,890
So I advised governments around the
world about what's going on.

1578
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:41,940
I'm under the radar as best I know and
there are countries I'm not going to

1579
01:13:41,941 --> 01:13:46,941
name them that are doing research under
the radar and are preventing people like

1580
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:50,670
myself from entering those buildings to
have a look what's going on.

1581
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,950
Yeah.
So I'm sure that,

1582
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:56,850
um,
what's going on in there is actually a

1583
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,970
little bit broader than what we hear
about,

1584
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:02,380
but I don't know.
How long has it performed?

1585
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:03,630
Just say Russia.
No,

1586
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:05,310
I didn't say Russia.
I didn't say anything.

1587
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:08,490
No country.
I want to be able to travel to Russia.

1588
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:11,771
Bye.
Oh,

1589
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:12,160
I said

1590
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:12,690
it.
But in,

1591
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:15,020
in,
in countries where there are a stent,

1592
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,850
different standards.
What's stopping a mothers who wants to

1593
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:22,150
prevent their child from having heart
disease which could kill their child,

1594
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,780
you know,
40 percent chance versus 100,000 and

1595
01:14:25,781 --> 01:14:30,520
eventually you could make a child that
could live 200 years once we know how to

1596
01:14:30,521 --> 01:14:32,470
do it.
That could be the future.

1597
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:38,990
There's always a concern that someone is
doing something that is beneficial in

1598
01:14:39,631 --> 01:14:43,740
one way but negative in another way.
And if everyone doesn't get to examine

1599
01:14:43,741 --> 01:14:45,260
the research,
um,

1600
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:49,440
it's very difficult.
Like if we wanted to in the United

1601
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,440
States wanted to do something similar to
what they're doing over there,

1602
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:55,020
we would want to have access to what
they've learned,

1603
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,033
right?

1604
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:57,610
Uh,
we would.

1605
01:14:57,611 --> 01:15:00,040
And so generally scientists share
inflammation,

1606
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:03,730
but there are companies that are
government owned that are very sacred,

1607
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:07,750
right?
Or even private organizations and that's

1608
01:15:07,751 --> 01:15:10,410
where it's a little tricky and that's
why we,

1609
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:14,020
we signed his get really upset when
companies or organizations don't share

1610
01:15:14,021 --> 01:15:17,140
information,
especially in something this critical

1611
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:21,160
and what's not really stated,
but it's my belief is that one of the

1612
01:15:21,161 --> 01:15:24,520
reasons it was such a backlash against
this crispr design,

1613
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:29,380
a baby experiment and it really was an
experiment and it's not just that it was

1614
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:33,430
potentially dangerous and you could end
up with kids that have deformities,

1615
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:38,560
but also that unless we do this in a,
in a measured manner,

1616
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:41,020
under supervision,
there's,

1617
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:44,980
there could be a backlash like there was
against stem cell research in the two

1618
01:15:44,981 --> 01:15:46,540
thousands.
We don't want that.

1619
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,370
Again,
we want to be able to do this the right

1620
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:49,500
way this time.
Right?

1621
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:52,560
Is it particularly if something goes
wrong with those children?

1622
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:55,270
One person could ruin it for millions of
people.

1623
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:57,980
Jump The gun and yeah,
so we're,

1624
01:15:58,010 --> 01:15:59,850
we're on the second generation of
Crispr.

1625
01:15:59,851 --> 01:16:00,684
Is that correct?

1626
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,330
Use of the editing tools.
They've become more.

1627
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,833
They have that.
There's,

1628
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:11,680
there's surprisingly that there's lot of
different bacteria that have the,

1629
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:13,000
these systems,
so we're,

1630
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:17,310
we're getting new ones all the time.
Some that are more accurate because you

1631
01:16:17,311 --> 01:16:18,900
don't want what we call off target
effect.

1632
01:16:18,901 --> 01:16:22,440
You don't want to accidentally mutates
some Jane that's required for head

1633
01:16:22,441 --> 01:16:23,820
development.
Um,

1634
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:24,703
and so yeah,
we're,

1635
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,960
I think in my department were on fourth
generation,

1636
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:29,520
fourth generation.
Wow.

1637
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:32,310
Yeah.
See I'm just going by radio lab

1638
01:16:32,311 --> 01:16:34,320
podcasts.
Yeah.

1639
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:35,640
So My,
my department have fun,

1640
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,790
Fun Department to be.
Imagine they are imitating all sorts of

1641
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:41,730
stuff.
What did you ever see the documentary

1642
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:44,800
icarus?
Oh yeah,

1643
01:16:44,801 --> 01:16:45,560
it rings a bell.

1644
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:50,560
It's Brian Fogle's documentary on the
Russian doping program,

1645
01:16:50,751 --> 01:16:55,751
state sponsored doping program in Sochi,
the Sochi Olympics and how they had this

1646
01:16:57,621 --> 01:17:02,150
incredibly complicated system of
stealing the urine and putting it

1647
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:04,710
through a hole in the wall and putting
fake urine back through.

1648
01:17:04,711 --> 01:17:06,110
It was really,
really amazing.

1649
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:08,030
Amazing,
amazing documentary,

1650
01:17:08,031 --> 01:17:10,070
but details

1651
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,520
this incredibly complicated state
sponsored doping system.

1652
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:21,340
I would imagine that with something like
crispr or some various new forms of

1653
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:27,530
genetic editing that that's one of the
things that they're going to be looking

1654
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:30,050
into,
that they're going to be looking into

1655
01:17:30,051 --> 01:17:33,050
things that are gonna,
enhance athletic performance.

1656
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:35,630
Yeah.
I mean you might need to have a DNA test

1657
01:17:35,631 --> 01:17:37,810
to see if you've put one of these
viruses in your.

1658
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:41,080
Why you 50 and now you're running like a
20 year old,

1659
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:44,450
so that's all possible.
You know that the.

1660
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:49,980
I also write reports for governments and
one of the things that I predicted 50

1661
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:54,500
within the next 15 years was crispr
being used to engineer the human genome

1662
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:57,140
and make a baby.
I didn't realize it was going to happen

1663
01:17:57,141 --> 01:17:58,360
within one year.
Wow.

1664
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:03,110
A lot of these technologies that I'm
trying to predict happened way faster

1665
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:03,930
than even I think.

1666
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:06,890
Is gonna happen.
Do you think it's possibly happened in

1667
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:09,920
other circumstances that they're not
going public with

1668
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,220
it?
It's always possible.

1669
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:17,150
That may be some human clones running
around right now that we don't know

1670
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:19,790
about.
Do you think so it's certainly doable.

1671
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:21,680
Scientifically,
there might be some rogue nation who's

1672
01:18:21,681 --> 01:18:23,750
doing it.
Barbara streisand's togs,

1673
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:26,490
or were pretty easy to clone.
Yeah.

1674
01:18:26,491 --> 01:18:28,040
That she had her dogs cloned,
right?

1675
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:29,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

1676
01:18:29,601 --> 01:18:31,580
Sammy,
the 14 year old dog is now,

1677
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:32,540
uh,
there's two of them.

1678
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:35,690
Jesus Christ.
It is so weird.

1679
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:37,260
That'd be like,
as I'd be so scared,

1680
01:18:37,261 --> 01:18:40,520
I'd go to sleep and wake up.
That thing will be hovering over my face

1681
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:43,430
was red glowing eyes.
Yeah.

1682
01:18:43,431 --> 01:18:45,300
Wait till you have designed a cemetery.
What?

1683
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:47,420
A friend of mine,
Carlos Bustamante at Stanford,

1684
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:51,080
we were entertaining the idea of making
dogs live longer,

1685
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:52,243
uh,
genetically.

1686
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:56,180
So why would you want your family member
to only live 12 years?

1687
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,270
I think about that man.
My daughter's only two and he's such a

1688
01:18:59,271 --> 01:19:00,820
sweetie,
you know,

1689
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:04,340
I'm sad that one day.
I mean I had to put my dog down recently

1690
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:09,470
and who's 13?
And it was really a massive two and he

1691
01:19:09,471 --> 01:19:12,770
was struggling and I just think man,
this two year old one day he's going to

1692
01:19:12,771 --> 01:19:15,010
be in that same sort of situation.
Well it isn't.

1693
01:19:15,011 --> 01:19:17,490
And so we have three dogs.
My wife runs a therapy dog.

1694
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:22,070
Streisand had her beloved dog.
Samantha cloned that crazy bitch.

1695
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:25,220
Look at her two copies of one dog.
Jesus Christ.

1696
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:28,060
That's so strange.
How much just get a new dog.

1697
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,170
You fucking nuts.
Well,

1698
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:33,920
so
we might be nuts in my household because

1699
01:19:33,921 --> 01:19:36,290
we were giving out dogs and a man.
Oh,

1700
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:37,820
and how's it?
Dylan?

1701
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,790
How old's the dog?
The oldest dog is nine and he's still

1702
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:41,653
doing fine.

1703
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:45,970
How does he look different?
My wife says so these are anecdotes.

1704
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:50,120
I'm not gonna publish them,
but I'm so alice has a therapy dog and

1705
01:19:50,121 --> 01:19:54,290
he has to go to hospitals and nursing
homes and if he has nmn according to my

1706
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:56,750
wife,
he can't be a therapy dog because he's

1707
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:57,890
too excited.
He's running around,

1708
01:19:57,891 --> 01:19:59,750
jumping around really?
So that,

1709
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:03,680
that's anecdotal,
but that seems to fit with what others

1710
01:20:03,681 --> 01:20:05,720
have experienced too.
Wow.

1711
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:09,210
Yeah.
So what we're hoping to have some

1712
01:20:09,211 --> 01:20:12,420
treatments for some pets are shortly.
One of the companies that I'm working

1713
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:15,090
with treatments for pets.
Yeah.

1714
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,740
Well you got to think,
hey man,

1715
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,920
dogs only live 13 years anyway,
you know.

1716
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,800
Well yeah.
And also we have a dog that has a kidney

1717
01:20:22,801 --> 01:20:25,440
defect and the vet says it's only going
to live five years,

1718
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:29,280
so she's three now.
So that's the one you experiment on what

1719
01:20:29,281 --> 01:20:31,170
we experiment on on,
on all of them.

1720
01:20:31,171 --> 01:20:32,004
But.

1721
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:37,080
But what's the downside that's got to be
so uncomfortable for some people

1722
01:20:37,081 --> 01:20:38,100
listening to this right now.
Like,

1723
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,110
oh,
I don't know how to feel about that.

1724
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,490
Right.
What is the downside?

1725
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:44,610
If your dog has got a kidney defect and
it's only going to probably live to be

1726
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:46,830
nine,
meanwhile the dog's going to live to be

1727
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:48,570
a thousand years old.
Well,

1728
01:20:48,571 --> 01:20:51,810
we'll say I'll come back.
I'll let you know in the Lotus position,

1729
01:20:51,811 --> 01:20:54,840
meditating 100 years from now.
What do you do?

1730
01:20:54,841 --> 01:20:57,420
If it starts talking to you,
that'd be great.

1731
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,220
Yeah.
What?

1732
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:04,220
What do you do if you turn a dog into
some new kind of thing that lives 30 or

1733
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:07,560
40 years,
what do you tell people?

1734
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:10,440
Like if your dog,
like right now you're talking about on

1735
01:21:10,441 --> 01:21:13,140
the podcast and for a bunch of people
probably going to remember,

1736
01:21:13,141 --> 01:21:14,190
but a lot of people for yet.

1737
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,680
But if like 15,
20 years from now,

1738
01:21:16,681 --> 01:21:20,250
your dog's still chasing balls and
people are going to come over your

1739
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:20,771
house.
Hey Dave,

1740
01:21:20,771 --> 01:21:22,260
what the fuck's going on with your dog,
man?

1741
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,790
Right.
Same Dog.

1742
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:24,700
That's Charlie.
Yeah.

1743
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,340
How come Charlie doesn't have gray hair
anymore,

1744
01:21:26,341 --> 01:21:27,180
man.
Right.

1745
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:27,990
Well,
you know,

1746
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:29,730
people ask have any gray hair?
No.

1747
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:31,681
Yeah,
man,

1748
01:21:31,681 --> 01:21:32,520
that's weird,
isn't it?

1749
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:33,960
You don't have any.
That's what you're driving.

1750
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:36,550
How long have you been on this stuff?
A wild rose virtual.

1751
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,740
I started 12 years ago.
It form in about three years ago.

1752
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:42,570
And a man about the same time.
Wow.

1753
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,030
Does anyone in your family have gray
hair?

1754
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:47,400
Is it a genetic issue?
Um,

1755
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:52,960
my father has old gray hair.
My brothers about the query to have

1756
01:21:52,961 --> 01:21:53,720
grade.
Wow.

1757
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,300
Is your brother taking the stuff you're
taking?

1758
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:57,500
Only recently.
Ah,

1759
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,700
interesting.
Yeah,

1760
01:21:59,701 --> 01:22:02,490
we call that an n of three in an
experiment,

1761
01:22:02,491 --> 01:22:03,810
which is insufficient.

1762
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,640
Right?
So I don't want to get slapped on the

1763
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:07,840
wrist by a,
of course with medical schools,

1764
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,040
somebody who's saying all these things,
you're just answering questions.

1765
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:11,940
Sorry.
Do not worry.

1766
01:22:12,190 --> 01:22:13,380
Right?
But so far so good.

1767
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:16,050
If I'm around in another hundred years,
we'll know something.

1768
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:18,600
So that would be unbelievably
fascinating.

1769
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:20,880
If your dog lived to be like 30 or 40
years old,

1770
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:25,250
that would be really incredible.
And if I meet you in 15 years,

1771
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:26,510
you still have dark hair.
I'll be like,

1772
01:22:26,511 --> 01:22:28,710
what?
What the hell,

1773
01:22:28,711 --> 01:22:33,060
man,
what are the things are you taking?

1774
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:36,680
Do you take multivitamins?
I take vitamin D,

1775
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,990
that's it with Katie.
Just Vitamin D.

1776
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:43,860
Yeah.
What about e or k or any of those?

1777
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:46,620
K Two and d together.
And that's it.

1778
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:48,760
Oh Hm.
So I'm,

1779
01:22:48,761 --> 01:22:50,700
I'm afraid of iron.
Afraid of it.

1780
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:52,290
Yeah.
Why?

1781
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,960
Uh,
there's some results that I've seen

1782
01:22:54,961 --> 01:22:56,970
that,
that excess iron,

1783
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:01,710
especially in the elderly leads to
Senescence of cells and buildup of those

1784
01:23:01,711 --> 01:23:02,790
Zombie cells is a bad thing.

1785
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,880
And is this a dietary iron from
vegetables or is it from cooking on a

1786
01:23:08,231 --> 01:23:10,300
cast iron pan or.
Well,

1787
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:13,670
I only know from correlation.
So I'm,

1788
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:16,960
I'm looking at tissue that's full of
iron and the cells are not looking good.

1789
01:23:16,961 --> 01:23:20,140
So all I can think is I don't want to
overload myself on it.

1790
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:22,040
So this is,
I'm like,

1791
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:25,630
hmm.
How much iron is too much iron?

1792
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,230
We don't know yet because I always hear
it,

1793
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:31,720
especially from women.
Iron deficiencies for some reason.

1794
01:23:31,721 --> 01:23:32,554
I,
I hear,

1795
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,650
I've heard it from several women.
Uh,

1796
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:36,510
sure.
Uh,

1797
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:40,600
but for the elderly,
overloading them with Ian I think is a

1798
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:43,450
real problem.
So there's a sweet spot to hit.

1799
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:44,111
Well,
yeah,

1800
01:23:44,111 --> 01:23:45,400
I'm sure.
I'm sure there is.

1801
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:48,700
But uh,
the iron will will damage your cells

1802
01:23:48,701 --> 01:23:53,170
pretty badly,
so you don't want to go overboard and no

1803
01:23:53,171 --> 01:23:56,290
other supplements.
Now I try to eat vegetables which

1804
01:23:56,291 --> 01:24:00,100
hopefully will make sure I'm,
I'm not deficient in anything.

1805
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,180
Green leafy dark vegetables.
Exactly,

1806
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,930
exactly.
If I can call her straight out of the

1807
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:10,780
fridge instead of going for the,
for uh,

1808
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:11,680
the,
uh,

1809
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:15,640
piece of cooked meat,
I'll go for a carrot or something.

1810
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:18,700
Eight somebody carrots,
I'll probably turn orange now.

1811
01:24:18,701 --> 01:24:21,670
Carrots have a little sugar,
a great.

1812
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:23,410
Now I've got to cut out my carrots.
Well,

1813
01:24:23,411 --> 01:24:24,880
I mean,
especially if you drink them in the

1814
01:24:24,881 --> 01:24:27,340
juice form,
like I know a lot of friends who really

1815
01:24:27,341 --> 01:24:30,640
enjoy fruit juices and vegetable juices.
And I always say,

1816
01:24:30,641 --> 01:24:32,710
well,
I mean at vegetable Jews,

1817
01:24:32,711 --> 01:24:34,240
yeah,
it's probably great,

1818
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:37,660
but fruit juice man drinking a big glass
of orange juice,

1819
01:24:37,661 --> 01:24:39,910
you might as well be having a Coca Cola.
Yeah,

1820
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:40,690
yeah,
I agree.

1821
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:45,690
So our household has a,
a ban on smoothies and fruit juices and

1822
01:24:47,891 --> 01:24:51,190
sodas that have sugar in them.
God used to be able to go to like Jamba

1823
01:24:51,191 --> 01:24:54,670
juice and get one of those big Ole
smoothies and feel like you're doing

1824
01:24:54,671 --> 01:24:55,930
something good for your body.

1825
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:57,430
I used to think,
yeah,

1826
01:24:57,431 --> 01:24:59,380
look it.
I got all this blueberries in there and

1827
01:24:59,381 --> 01:25:02,410
great stuff.
But meanwhile there's just a gang of

1828
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:04,090
sugar in that thing.
Yeah.

1829
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:07,120
I had an interesting thing that that
whole milk is actually potentially

1830
01:25:07,121 --> 01:25:11,040
better for you than the low fat.
You'll use less of it and it doesn't,

1831
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:12,700
you know,
milk has some sugar in it.

1832
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:15,160
It's also attached the fat,
right?

1833
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:17,740
The whole milk has fat in it.
It's normal.

1834
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:19,630
It's normal for your body to consume it
that way.

1835
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:20,240
Right.
What?

1836
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:23,680
What I want is I want my money back from
the nutritionists in the 19 seventies

1837
01:25:23,681 --> 01:25:26,740
and eighties.
I skipped eggs and Bacon.

1838
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:29,590
It could have been eating that stuff.
While you remember that food pyramid

1839
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:33,340
that used to be in the Dr Seuss books,
you're teaching kids to eat cereal,

1840
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:36,700
you know it's so crazy and put
monitoring on your bread.

1841
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:39,150
Oh,
that's the best stuff.

1842
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:43,000
The best bad advice that they ever gave
vegetable oils,

1843
01:25:43,001 --> 01:25:46,870
which are fucking terrible for you.
All those disgusting vegetables,

1844
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:50,050
safflower and corn oil,
all that stuff.

1845
01:25:50,051 --> 01:25:53,230
That's just terrible.
Terrible for you.

1846
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:55,440
It is.
The other thing that that mothers used

1847
01:25:55,441 --> 01:25:58,780
to to some extent,
still tell their kids is don't go

1848
01:25:58,781 --> 01:26:00,640
hungry.
Have a snack.

1849
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:03,040
Yeah.
I shouldn't say mother's parents in,

1850
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:08,270
but in my family it's my wife.
She hates to see our kids go hungry at

1851
01:26:08,271 --> 01:26:09,980
all,
so it's always ate eight,

1852
01:26:09,981 --> 01:26:11,420
ate never be hungry and I'm there
saying,

1853
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:12,201
no,
be hungry.

1854
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:15,440
It's good for you.
And it's this tension with children

1855
01:26:15,441 --> 01:26:16,940
though,
because children are growing.

1856
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,460
I always assume that children,
they should just eat whenever they're

1857
01:26:19,461 --> 01:26:20,750
hungry.
Well,

1858
01:26:20,751 --> 01:26:24,440
that's what stated.
I'm not sure if that's

1859
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:29,300
the case often.
My son is somewhat.

1860
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:32,990
My son isn't thin.
Put it that way and he'll be going out

1861
01:26:32,991 --> 01:26:36,050
the door and my wife will say,
have you had breakfast now?

1862
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:38,240
I'm not hungry.
You have to eat something,

1863
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:39,650
and I'm thinking,
no,

1864
01:26:39,651 --> 01:26:42,260
you got plenty of energy stored there.
Don't worry about it.

1865
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:45,260
Yeah,
I mean it makes sense.

1866
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:49,520
The only thing that I think of is that
when you're a young person,

1867
01:26:49,521 --> 01:26:54,350
your body is still actually growing and
developing as opposed to you and I.

1868
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:56,930
If we're fasting,
it makes sense.

1869
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:57,741
Right?
It makes sense.

1870
01:26:57,741 --> 01:26:59,750
You're,
you're giving your body a break and

1871
01:26:59,751 --> 01:27:03,980
there's all sorts of proven benefits to
that fasting process and well,

1872
01:27:03,981 --> 01:27:08,480
if you have a child who's overweight,
it isn't a bad thing to skip a meal.

1873
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:10,250
No,
no.

1874
01:27:10,251 --> 01:27:11,660
It's not the.
The one,

1875
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:14,870
the thing that worries me about children
that are overweight skipping a meal

1876
01:27:14,871 --> 01:27:19,460
though is that they're not as
disciplined and they're not so good

1877
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:23,790
psychologically with struggling and
having know,

1878
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:28,360
having hunger pangs and that you're
going to fuck their head up straight.

1879
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:32,030
The teachers are probably be very angry
with me that the kids can't concentrate

1880
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:33,380
well.
It's not just that.

1881
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:34,820
Yeah,
the kids can't concentrate,

1882
01:27:34,821 --> 01:27:38,060
but I just,
I worry that it's in some way shape or

1883
01:27:38,061 --> 01:27:39,710
form abusive,
like to say,

1884
01:27:39,711 --> 01:27:40,850
hey,
you're overweight,

1885
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:43,720
you need to lose weight.
Like I don't think they're like,

1886
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:49,080
I don't think they're really designed to
go without the way way a grown adult

1887
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:51,680
does.
These are my own perceptions.

1888
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:56,420
I think that it's probably far better to
adjust their diet and if you've got a

1889
01:27:56,421 --> 01:28:01,421
kid just slowly get their body weight
down with exercise,

1890
01:28:01,641 --> 01:28:06,260
particularly with resistance training
and doing things that really burn off a

1891
01:28:06,261 --> 01:28:10,130
lot of calories and then just get them
off the sugar and then I think the way

1892
01:28:10,131 --> 01:28:14,180
it'll slowly slip off,
probably not even so slowly if you can

1893
01:28:14,181 --> 01:28:16,400
really get them off a significant sugar
binge.

1894
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:19,550
Exactly.
So that's why I'm taking my son to the

1895
01:28:19,551 --> 01:28:20,750
gym as well.
I agree with that.

1896
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:21,500
Yeah.
I'm,

1897
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:24,170
I'm just,
just to clarify because I don't want a

1898
01:28:24,171 --> 01:28:27,200
bunch of hate mail.
All I'm saying is don't force feed a

1899
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:28,220
kid.
Yes,

1900
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:29,061
yes.
Yeah.

1901
01:28:29,061 --> 01:28:30,680
Don't force feed a kid.
Yeah,

1902
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:33,290
I agree with that,
but I just think that kids,

1903
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:35,660
they just get so fucking hungry,
man.

1904
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:38,600
They get their little bodies are like
little hummingbirds.

1905
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,930
No burning so much energy.
Yeah,

1906
01:28:41,931 --> 01:28:43,180
they do.
I'm amazing.

1907
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:45,770
You don't take any other supplements?
Just vitamin D?

1908
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:48,020
No multivitamins.
You don't want to like cover all your

1909
01:28:48,021 --> 01:28:50,190
bases?
No whole food supplements,

1910
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:54,680
like vitamin A or a plant based
supplement that you can take during the

1911
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:55,840
day?
No,

1912
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:59,490
none of that.
No.

1913
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:01,980
I've subscribed the idea that a lot of

1914
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,840
it's expensive urine and Nope,
I'm testing myself so I know if I'm

1915
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:11,400
deficient in something bad and all my
vitals or close to optimal.

1916
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,450
So if something's out of whack out of
see it probably.

1917
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:19,650
So you were saying you do things for the
government.

1918
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:22,610
What did I say that,
you know,

1919
01:29:22,611 --> 01:29:25,440
you said that earlier you said I should
ask you on.

1920
01:29:25,441 --> 01:29:30,060
I didn't really did in for the show
started as was outside.

1921
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:36,270
I was feeling frisky now that I've
thought about it,

1922
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,570
a sign to go to jail.
I'll,

1923
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,260
I'll,
I'll talk about the.

1924
01:29:40,261 --> 01:29:44,430
A good idea to get you in trouble.
So let's pause and think this for a

1925
01:29:44,431 --> 01:29:45,600
moment.
There,

1926
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:47,490
things that you can't talk about,
please don't.

1927
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:49,470
Uh,
there's a lot to talk about.

1928
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:53,130
I just have to make sure it's nothing
that's confidential,

1929
01:29:53,131 --> 01:29:56,190
but there's a lot of interesting stuff
going on on the planet.

1930
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,770
There's,
there's areas of biodefense that are

1931
01:29:58,771 --> 01:29:59,970
pretty scary.
Also.

1932
01:29:59,971 --> 01:30:04,971
Some nations are apparently working on
using crispr and other gene editing

1933
01:30:06,121 --> 01:30:10,830
systems and modifying bugs that could
wipe out a few hundred million people

1934
01:30:10,831 --> 01:30:12,570
pretty quickly.
What do you do?

1935
01:30:12,571 --> 01:30:13,760
How do you detect that?
Um,

1936
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:16,710
even the flu,
that's a massive by threat and it may

1937
01:30:16,711 --> 01:30:19,580
just be natural and that could wipe out
another 100 million people.

1938
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:22,620
I can data exactly a century ago.
So,

1939
01:30:22,621 --> 01:30:23,760
um,
I work on that stuff.

1940
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:26,300
I'm detecting viruses,
a,

1941
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:29,100
wiping them out,
cleaning a room of DNA,

1942
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:32,160
uh,
making sure that everything's clean.

1943
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,560
Um,
so I'll give you an example so that the

1944
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,820
navy seals came out to my lab,
um,

1945
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,620
and they like to ask him how our group
to solve some hard problems.

1946
01:30:40,621 --> 01:30:45,150
And so the problem they set us on was
how do you kill anthrax?

1947
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:47,700
I'm safely now,
right now,

1948
01:30:47,701 --> 01:30:48,660
it's very difficult to kill.

1949
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:50,880
Of course,
when the anthrax letter was opened in

1950
01:30:50,881 --> 01:30:52,240
the Senate,
what was it,

1951
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,990
a number of years ago?
It cost $25,000,000.

1952
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,810
They had to seal it off and put hydrogen
peroxide all over.

1953
01:30:57,930 --> 01:31:01,140
Everything destroyed the computers.
So they're wondering how do you kill

1954
01:31:01,141 --> 01:31:04,830
anthrax safely so that you don't have to
be in a hazmat suit to do it.

1955
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:10,490
And so what we came up with after
thinking about it for about a week was

1956
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:13,470
we need a,
a biological solution,

1957
01:31:13,471 --> 01:31:16,050
not a chemical.
And so we found a,

1958
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:18,530
an organism that,
uh,

1959
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:22,230
where its whereabouts I cannot disclose,
but it's a very interesting organism

1960
01:31:22,231 --> 01:31:27,231
that grows at high temperature and it
destroys all bacterial and viral life.

1961
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:29,970
Um,
and it wipes it out and it doesn't hurt

1962
01:31:29,971 --> 01:31:32,830
humans at all.
You as a,

1963
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:34,920
or at least an animal studies,
you can breathe it in,

1964
01:31:34,921 --> 01:31:36,330
you can put it anywhere and it's fine.

1965
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:41,690
So this is a,
a cocktail of enzymes that destroys the

1966
01:31:42,061 --> 01:31:44,130
microbes,
including anthrax.

1967
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:49,200
So it doesn't have any effect on humans,
but what about the bacteria that lives

1968
01:31:49,201 --> 01:31:51,480
in our body,
our will,

1969
01:31:51,481 --> 01:31:54,840
we haven't eaten it yet.
What we're hoping to do is to do a

1970
01:31:54,841 --> 01:31:57,480
clinical trial soon on removing
biofilms.

1971
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:01,180
So in the wounds of patients,
the problem that they,

1972
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,490
the reason they don't heal very well,
especially these diabetic,

1973
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:05,500
chronic wounds,
that by the way,

1974
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:07,240
that every 10 minutes someone's losing a
limb,

1975
01:32:07,241 --> 01:32:09,460
thanks to that,
these biofilms,

1976
01:32:09,461 --> 01:32:12,100
you have to digest them off and do you
know how they do it right now?

1977
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:14,740
They scrub them off,
it's horrific.

1978
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:17,830
Then they cut the skin and they keep
cutting and cutting and eventually you

1979
01:32:17,831 --> 01:32:21,010
lose a limb.
This looks really promising in animal

1980
01:32:21,011 --> 01:32:25,450
studies that we should be able to not
just kill the bacteria in the wound,

1981
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:28,240
which is a problem,
but get rid of that biofilm.

1982
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:31,330
That's amazing.
So things like Murcia

1983
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:35,860
staph infections,
exactly.

1984
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:39,610
Be Able to stop it in its tracks before
it gets systemic,

1985
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,210
right?
Spray that stuff on a cruise line for is

1986
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,140
for the virus,
a norovirus.

1987
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:47,080
Um,
even if it turns out to be that safe,

1988
01:32:47,081 --> 01:32:51,250
why not just wiped down schools?
Oh,

1989
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:54,700
because I was worried about the negative
aspect,

1990
01:32:54,701 --> 01:32:56,490
like what's going to happen?
Like what's,

1991
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,480
what's going to be the blowback,
right?

1992
01:32:58,510 --> 01:33:03,510
Like antibiotics is what's created
medicine resistant antibiotic for staph

1993
01:33:06,251 --> 01:33:07,090
infections.
Right,

1994
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:08,260
right,
right.

1995
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:10,380
Your mind always jumps to the worst
possible scenario.

1996
01:33:11,030 --> 01:33:13,120
Love it.
We'd make a good,

1997
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:15,110
good team.
So I'm the,

1998
01:33:15,111 --> 01:33:16,870
I got a buddy cop movie.
Yeah,

1999
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,820
let's do it.
Uh,

2000
01:33:19,410 --> 01:33:21,880
so we've tested,
does it induce antibiotic resistance?

2001
01:33:21,881 --> 01:33:23,850
And so far it's negative.
Mm.

2002
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:25,000
Okay,
interesting.

2003
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:26,500
Oh,
another thing I'll tell you.

2004
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:31,750
So I work with a company that detects
organisms,

2005
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,540
so we want to detect if there's another
virus coming across the planet.

2006
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:36,730
So how do you do that quickly?
Um,

2007
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:38,710
and how do you do it if you don't know
what you're looking for.

2008
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:44,220
So we can take a drop of blood or a swab
off the table and we can see all the

2009
01:33:44,231 --> 01:33:47,050
organisms that are there.
We can do your microbiome,

2010
01:33:47,051 --> 01:33:50,140
but that's easy.
We can do a drop of blood,

2011
01:33:50,141 --> 01:33:52,660
will tell you all the bacteria and
viruses in there.

2012
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:58,000
And it'll tell you how to kill it,
which is great for health care because

2013
01:33:58,001 --> 01:34:00,280
right now microbiology labs I've worked
in one.

2014
01:34:00,281 --> 01:34:05,230
I used to swap urine and poop on plates.
It was very glamorous.

2015
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:07,270
That's how it still done.
That is,

2016
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:10,780
that's 19th century,
early 20th century technology growing on

2017
01:34:10,781 --> 01:34:12,370
a plate.
Wait a few days,

2018
01:34:12,371 --> 01:34:15,010
see what grows.
But that's useless for diseases like

2019
01:34:15,011 --> 01:34:17,560
viruses and lyme disease,
lyme disease.

2020
01:34:17,561 --> 01:34:19,780
You know the one from ticks in your,
in your spine.

2021
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:24,700
My daughter got lyme disease and she was
really sick.

2022
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:26,990
She was losing her eyesight.
It was serious.

2023
01:34:26,991 --> 01:34:30,430
It got into her brain and the hospital
wouldn't give her the antibiotic because

2024
01:34:30,431 --> 01:34:33,130
I,
the tests weren't quick enough and they

2025
01:34:33,131 --> 01:34:36,640
wouldn't give her the antibiotic until
the test were positive for insurance

2026
01:34:36,641 --> 01:34:39,220
reasons.
And I said just Gimme that Gimme the DNA

2027
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:41,110
of my daughter,
the spinal fluid,

2028
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,910
I'll test it.
They wouldn't do that.

2029
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:47,920
So I was furious.
So I spun out a company out of my lab

2030
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:49,530
with some very smart,
um,

2031
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:52,270
bioinformaticians mathematicians,
software engineers.

2032
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:54,970
We built supercomputers to be able to do
this.

2033
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:57,620
Teamed up with a guy in Stanford,
my friend,

2034
01:34:57,621 --> 01:34:57,980
I mentioned

2035
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,030
him,
Carlos Bustamante.

2036
01:34:59,031 --> 01:35:00,890
He's the guy that uh,
did.

2037
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,120
Uh,
oh,

2038
01:35:02,121 --> 01:35:04,130
maybe I shouldn't,
but he did a famous person's genome

2039
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:05,450
recently.
Um,

2040
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:07,150
his,
he'd been trained on mummy's,

2041
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:09,530
um,
and he did Kennewick man.

2042
01:35:09,531 --> 01:35:14,531
And so this technology can be teamed up
with what I've done to be able to get

2043
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:17,210
rid of all the human dna out of blood
sample,

2044
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:19,220
leave the viruses,
lead the bacteria,

2045
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:22,100
and then run that through a second super
computer,

2046
01:35:22,190 --> 01:35:27,190
all the DNA and tell you within probably
seconds eventually what it is.

2047
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:31,340
So my daughter would,
would have a diagnosis within eventually

2048
01:35:31,341 --> 01:35:33,560
will be just 10 minutes instead of
waiting a week.

2049
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:37,130
Wow.
Lyme diseases terrifying.

2050
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,930
There are,
there are so many people that are

2051
01:35:38,931 --> 01:35:43,820
infected with it and I know personally
maybe 10 people that have it and a

2052
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:48,170
couple that have had significant issues
with it that have lasted for years.

2053
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:51,670
I know a guy who was hospitalized for a
full year on it lights.

2054
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:54,020
It's really bad and it.
And it can hide as well.

2055
01:35:54,021 --> 01:35:55,220
That's the problem.
Yeah.

2056
01:35:55,221 --> 01:35:56,200
Um,
and it,

2057
01:35:56,201 --> 01:35:59,530
it wrecks joints.
And that thought,

2058
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:02,270
a lot of countries have actually deny
that they have lung disease.

2059
01:36:02,271 --> 01:36:05,620
Australia's a good example.
People getting what seems to be lyme

2060
01:36:05,621 --> 01:36:07,760
disease and no one knows if it is or
not.

2061
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:10,250
Give those samples to us.
We'll tell you what's in there.

2062
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:13,640
Well,
it seems to be very difficult with

2063
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:18,620
certain doctors for them to tell if they
don't see that bullseye infection.

2064
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,840
Exactly.
So my daughter,

2065
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:22,670
our daughter,
Natalie and middle daughter,

2066
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:24,830
she didn't have a bullseye.
She had nothing.

2067
01:36:24,831 --> 01:36:26,520
The first thing we need to be.
Oh,

2068
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:29,060
so it's inflammation around the bite of
the tick,

2069
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,350
right.
And um,

2070
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:31,280
and there's,
uh,

2071
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,090
there's the actual bite and then there's
a circle on the outside of it.

2072
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:38,240
And for whatever reason,
this occurs with lyme disease,

2073
01:36:38,241 --> 01:36:42,380
but oftentimes goes away quickly.
So if you bring a person in and they

2074
01:36:42,381 --> 01:36:44,390
have the lyme disease,
but they don't have that bullseye

2075
01:36:44,391 --> 01:36:46,340
anymore,
which is what happened to my friend

2076
01:36:46,341 --> 01:36:49,040
Steve Son,
he tried to tell them that it was lyme

2077
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:49,970
disease.
They,

2078
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:52,100
the doctors were incredulous.
They didn't believe him.

2079
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:56,090
And it took until the kid had bell's
palsy at his face.

2080
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,670
Exactly.
That's what happened in our family.

2081
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:03,740
It's crazy.
And so I was bitten by a tick last year,

2082
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,500
right behind the knee,
and it didn't form a bullseye.

2083
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:10,040
Maybe I didn't give it time,
but it definitely was very painful

2084
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:11,090
thing.
Um,

2085
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:12,980
I could tell that there was something
going on.

2086
01:37:12,981 --> 01:37:16,100
It was really itchy and I went to the
pharmacy and I said,

2087
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:18,050
can I have the antibiotic?
It's,

2088
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,940
you know,
it's probably costs a few dollars for

2089
01:37:19,941 --> 01:37:20,774
the antibiotic.

2090
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:22,003
And they said,
no,

2091
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:25,670
we won't give it to you till we see a
bullseye and you need to bring the

2092
01:37:25,671 --> 01:37:27,350
ticket.
While I didn't bring the tick with me.

2093
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:29,600
So again,
I'm the doctors and nurses.

2094
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:31,700
Worst nightmare.
I wouldn't leave until they gave me the

2095
01:37:31,701 --> 01:37:33,830
antibiotic.
And I'm glad because I don't want to

2096
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,810
wait till I give it to you.
They did.

2097
01:37:35,811 --> 01:37:38,030
I wasn't going to leave until I got it.
Uh,

2098
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:39,770
but I don't want to wait a week,
you know,

2099
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:42,740
I'm starting to lose my.
Did you get upset with them to say,

2100
01:37:42,741 --> 01:37:43,970
listen,
you dumb mother fuckers.

2101
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:46,640
I'm super smart.
I work with jeans.

2102
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:49,640
Uh,
no.

2103
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:51,200
Not that occasion.
It's tempting.

2104
01:37:51,201 --> 01:37:52,330
It's tempting.
No,

2105
01:37:52,370 --> 01:37:53,330
you can always say,
Hey,

2106
01:37:53,331 --> 01:37:56,520
I'm a professor at Harvard and then they
probably just really kick you out.

2107
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:59,490
Yeah.
What do you say?

2108
01:37:59,491 --> 01:38:01,170
I mean,
how long did it take before they

2109
01:38:01,171 --> 01:38:02,004
listened to you?

2110
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:04,400
Uh,
so I went through,

2111
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,410
I basically started spouting biology so
that they knew their.

2112
01:38:07,411 --> 01:38:09,440
I knew something about it.
Oh,

2113
01:38:09,530 --> 01:38:10,940
it was about 15 minutes.
Oh,

2114
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:13,170
that's not bad.
He knew what to say.

2115
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:17,010
It be there for days by Bro.
Trust me.

2116
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,250
Right.
Let me draw you a picture of the tick.

2117
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,200
Yeah,
I mean I would just think they'd want to

2118
01:38:22,201 --> 01:38:24,900
hand that stuff out quick with so many
people getting it.

2119
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:28,560
It's so common.
I mean we looked at a map recently on

2120
01:38:28,561 --> 01:38:33,120
the podcast have lyme disease infections
across the east coast and the east coast

2121
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:36,000
of United States.
Obviously that's where you live is just

2122
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:38,190
a hotbed.
It's crazy.

2123
01:38:38,191 --> 01:38:39,990
It's everywhere.
Well,

2124
01:38:39,991 --> 01:38:42,690
it isn't an.
I've got friends on Cape Cod where it's

2125
01:38:42,691 --> 01:38:44,340
really prevalent,
really bad,

2126
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:47,730
so bad that.
So they keep the antibiotic in their

2127
01:38:47,731 --> 01:38:52,110
kitchen drawer to Jesus and if you catch
it quick enough,

2128
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:54,180
does it stop it in its tracks?

2129
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,340
Yeah.
So the real problem is when it gets into

2130
01:38:56,341 --> 01:38:59,490
your bloodstream and you don't treat it
long enough or quick enough.

2131
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:01,110
Exactly.
And so my,

2132
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:03,060
my daughter needed a what's called a pic
line,

2133
01:39:03,061 --> 01:39:05,310
which has delivered the antibiotic to
straight into the heart.

2134
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:06,810
Oh,
because they left it too long.

2135
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,180
God,
I'd want to kill them and she didn't

2136
01:39:09,181 --> 01:39:11,910
have a ring,
a ring of inflammation.

2137
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:15,840
But you knew I didn't.
I thought it was meningitis,

2138
01:39:15,841 --> 01:39:18,540
bacteria in the brain or something like
leukemia.

2139
01:39:18,541 --> 01:39:22,530
Was the other possibility,
those dirty fucking bugs,

2140
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:26,520
what can be done to,
to somehow or another eradicate those

2141
01:39:26,521 --> 01:39:28,170
things.
Oh.

2142
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:29,004
So,
um,

2143
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:31,560
again,
one of my friends got a few friends

2144
01:39:31,561 --> 01:39:32,590
here,
uh,

2145
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:36,360
she was working at Mit and she's
developed a way using the crispr system

2146
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,760
to kill these,
as you say,

2147
01:39:38,761 --> 01:39:40,130
damn little fuckers.
Um,

2148
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:44,130
and so there is possibly going to be the
first test of releasing a modified

2149
01:39:44,131 --> 01:39:46,140
organism,
the lyme organism,

2150
01:39:46,141 --> 01:39:46,980
to kill them off.

2151
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:50,030
Wow.
MP,

2152
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:52,980
you know that's going to cross some new
superbugs gonna kill everybody.

2153
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:56,310
It's going to be like that.
A Brad Pitt movie,

2154
01:39:56,311 --> 01:39:57,930
the Zombie One,
World War z

2155
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,980
might be,
but on the other hand,

2156
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:05,550
we might all be saved from lung disease.
I would like that.

2157
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:07,150
That would be great.
I just.

2158
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:10,290
Where did lyme disease come from?
There was some conspiracy theory

2159
01:40:10,291 --> 01:40:12,110
website.
There was thinking that lyme disease was

2160
01:40:12,111 --> 01:40:15,060
some sort of a,
some sort of a biological weapon.

2161
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:17,700
That's probably bullshit,
I'm sure.

2162
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:19,800
But it came out.
It was in Lyme,

2163
01:40:19,801 --> 01:40:20,640
Connecticut,
right?

2164
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:22,750
Wasn't that one of the first cases?
Yeah,

2165
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:28,130
so that's a close enough to Harvard just
stayed away.

2166
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,630
I thought you said Russians were buying
it.

2167
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:32,730
Oh No.
I said conspiracy theory.

2168
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:36,180
I didn't say it was Russian,
but as a biological weapon,

2169
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:41,070
it's just an awful thing and that.
And now there's the.

2170
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:46,280
I'm sure you're aware of the lone star
tick that gives people that I'm a Alpha

2171
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:47,070
Gal.

2172
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:50,010
D disease,
the one that makes you allergic to red

2173
01:40:50,011 --> 01:40:52,910
meat,
which is where.

2174
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:56,020
Where was that before?
It's crazy to see these things morphing

2175
01:40:56,021 --> 01:40:58,120
and morphing and there are a lot of
bugs,

2176
01:40:58,121 --> 01:41:01,060
we don't know.
Somebody just published a few days ago

2177
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:04,150
that they took surveys of the microbiome
on the skin,

2178
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:07,780
mouth got across the planet,
different races,

2179
01:41:07,781 --> 01:41:10,060
different foods,
geographic geography,

2180
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,870
and they have 100,000 different
organisms living on humanity

2181
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,130
and most of them are unknown.
That's crazy.

2182
01:41:18,131 --> 01:41:18,910
Right?
Right.

2183
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:23,170
And all they have to do is just more,
a little bit one way or the other way

2184
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:26,050
and all of a sudden people were dropping
like flies.

2185
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,320
Yeah.
And what's interesting is on the skin

2186
01:41:28,321 --> 01:41:32,380
and in the gut of people in India is
very different than what we have and the

2187
01:41:32,381 --> 01:41:35,580
different smells you might.
They probably think we smell bad,

2188
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:38,680
but I know this because.
Well they're wrong.

2189
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:39,791
Yeah.
Right.

2190
01:41:39,791 --> 01:41:44,150
Because I smelled like old spice,
but the,

2191
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:47,560
these wounds there actually if you want
to kill the bacteria in a wound,

2192
01:41:47,561 --> 01:41:50,980
they're different in the wounds of
people in India than they are over here.

2193
01:41:50,981 --> 01:41:51,581
And.
Oh Wow.

2194
01:41:51,581 --> 01:41:55,300
That's interesting.
And obviously they have different diets

2195
01:41:55,301 --> 01:41:57,510
too,
so there's probably different things

2196
01:41:57,530 --> 01:42:00,850
they're used to consuming.
And so their gut bacteria is different,

2197
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:02,460
right?
Everything's different.

2198
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:06,160
The genomes are different.
So we need to map the globe to first

2199
01:42:06,161 --> 01:42:08,410
know what we're dealing with before we
can address.

2200
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:11,200
It just seems like a never ending
struggle.

2201
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:15,730
It,
it everyday is a struggle against the

2202
01:42:15,731 --> 01:42:17,410
natural world.
They want to kill us.

2203
01:42:17,411 --> 01:42:18,730
And he goes,
yeah,

2204
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,220
everything,
the little things and the big things,

2205
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:26,310
all of it with food.
So how much of your time gets consumed

2206
01:42:26,501 --> 01:42:28,730
with this kind of work?
Ah,

2207
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:30,790
well it's all.
Everything is all consuming.

2208
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:34,620
My,
my typical day is I got to go to a

2209
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:37,840
company meeting going to the US
government.

2210
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:40,120
I'm getting called by senator for an
update.

2211
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:43,990
Uh,
so probably A.

2212
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:45,310
Actually,
let me be formal about this.

2213
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:49,720
Harvard University allows me to spend 20
percent of my time outside of the

2214
01:42:49,721 --> 01:42:51,790
university.
So it's 19 point nine.

2215
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:56,080
So you have to cover your ass.
Is that?

2216
01:42:56,081 --> 01:43:01,081
We just did maybe,
but he tracks their time now anymore.

2217
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:05,160
But I would think that with a guy like
you who's so you're,

2218
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:07,300
you're,
you concentrate so much.

2219
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:12,400
You're so focused on anti anti,
anti aging that having a gigantic

2220
01:43:12,401 --> 01:43:17,401
workload would seem to me to be a.
That would be an issue in terms of

2221
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:20,590
overtaxing your system stressing
yourself out.

2222
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:24,070
So nobody's ever asked me that and it's
a really good question.

2223
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:26,430
Um,
but I'm,

2224
01:43:26,431 --> 01:43:28,810
I'm not really worried about dying.
I actually,

2225
01:43:28,811 --> 01:43:32,380
I'm not worried at all at all.
I know is,

2226
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:33,910
you know,
it was a wolf in the room.

2227
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:35,680
He's staring at you,
you know,

2228
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:38,170
that'd be a grizzly death.
I'd probably not want that,

2229
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:41,680
but I've been,
I thought I was going to die and on

2230
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:45,730
airplanes before and I'm pretty calm
about that.

2231
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:49,510
So I guess that's a good test.
But I do want to leave a legacy.

2232
01:43:49,511 --> 01:43:52,640
I want to be able to say the world's
better for me being on the planet.

2233
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:55,040
Um,
and so that's why I do all this stuff.

2234
01:43:55,050 --> 01:43:57,080
I tried to protect the,
the humanity.

2235
01:43:57,081 --> 01:44:00,530
I try to protect nature.
I'm trying to help with food production.

2236
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:03,260
Um,
my aging stuff is what I'm known for,

2237
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:06,890
but I do a lot of this other stuff that
people don't know that.

2238
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:12,400
So you'll,
your concern is anti aging,

2239
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,410
you certainly want people to live
longer,

2240
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:20,300
but you yourself are more concerned with
your work than you are with your own

2241
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,490
personal life.
Oh,

2242
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:25,640
100 percent.
My wife will tell you that the reason

2243
01:44:25,641 --> 01:44:30,200
that I look after myself as best I can
when I've got the energy is it would be

2244
01:44:30,201 --> 01:44:32,270
a bad look if I died from heart disease
tomorrow.

2245
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:34,670
Yes.
The anti aging guy.

2246
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:37,700
Well,
if you died from anything other than an

2247
01:44:37,701 --> 01:44:38,960
accident,
right?

2248
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:39,921
Yeah.
All right.

2249
01:44:39,921 --> 01:44:41,690
So I'm trying to be a role model for
others.

2250
01:44:42,090 --> 01:44:42,960
Uh,
but you know,

2251
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:44,480
if I,
if I died tomorrow,

2252
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,570
that'd be fine with me.
I'd like to finish my work at least,

2253
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:49,760
uh,
I would like to leave something behind.

2254
01:44:49,761 --> 01:44:54,761
But what I don't want to do is to be a
burden on my kids and my grandkids.

2255
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:57,200
And so that's what I'm also trying to
prevent.

2256
01:44:57,890 --> 01:45:00,440
Yeah.
That would seem to me to be the real

2257
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:05,420
final frontier of anti aging is folks
that are really,

2258
01:45:05,421 --> 01:45:10,310
really old because it seems like they
would be open to try almost anything.

2259
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:15,530
And if you could bring them back,
that would be uber bizarre.

2260
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:19,360
Right?
How far away do you think we are from

2261
01:45:19,370 --> 01:45:20,590
doing something like that?
Well,

2262
01:45:20,591 --> 01:45:23,300
it,
it often comes as a shock to people who

2263
01:45:23,301 --> 01:45:27,170
don't work on this that we're already
testing these molecules in clinical

2264
01:45:27,171 --> 01:45:31,850
trials on elderly people have been doing
that for a number of years now with some

2265
01:45:31,851 --> 01:45:32,684
positive results.

2266
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:36,360
I'm over at Harvard.
We were giving any men and,

2267
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,660
and another molecule called mit be 66.
Um,

2268
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:43,910
what's the other one called?
My laundry so that the company's called

2269
01:45:43,911 --> 01:45:48,911
Metro Biotech and uh,
it makes Super Nad boosters and the drug

2270
01:45:49,251 --> 01:45:52,060
is called developmental drugs.
MIB,

2271
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:53,510
dash six,
two six,

2272
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:55,550
six,
two six.

2273
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:57,560
Yeah.
And we're hoping that it will not just

2274
01:45:57,561 --> 01:45:59,660
have to get that alleyway somewhere.
Ah,

2275
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:02,900
I got to go to some shady doctor with a
weird accent.

2276
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:06,920
Uh,
that one,

2277
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:09,110
uh,
that one we hope to get on the market in

2278
01:46:09,111 --> 01:46:11,660
about three years from now.
Really?

2279
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:12,530
Yeah,
for,

2280
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:16,310
for diseases FDA approved.
And so they're using it right now on old

2281
01:46:16,311 --> 01:46:19,490
folks are testing it,
tests for safety,

2282
01:46:20,330 --> 01:46:21,950
but we're also going to be testing
later,

2283
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:23,300
uh,
energy.

2284
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:25,490
Uh,
we can measure actually the Nad levels,

2285
01:46:25,491 --> 01:46:28,970
that molecule I mentioned,
we can measure that in their muscles and

2286
01:46:28,971 --> 01:46:30,170
we'll test if that worked.

2287
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:31,473
Um,
and we'll,

2288
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:35,000
we'll measure of course their endurance
because at the mice that we traded with

2289
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:37,910
Nmn,
they just ran and ran and ran.

2290
01:46:37,911 --> 01:46:40,820
They actually broke the little treadmill
in my lap because they ran so far.

2291
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:43,910
And you're giving it to them orally or
you're injecting into them?

2292
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:44,680
Uh,
it's uh,

2293
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:47,470
it's a little tablet.
They just put food,

2294
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,350
put it in their fruit or something like
that.

2295
01:46:49,450 --> 01:46:50,340
All the mice.
Yeah.

2296
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:52,680
Oh No,
I thought you're talking about humans in

2297
01:46:52,681 --> 01:46:54,090
the mice.
We put in their drinking water,

2298
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,150
drink it fairly easy.
Wow.

2299
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:00,090
And they have no idea,
no idea.

2300
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:02,250
And in fact,
the people who are running the treadmill

2301
01:47:02,251 --> 01:47:05,700
have no idea which is which.
But we had mice running three kilometers

2302
01:47:05,701 --> 01:47:09,480
and then the machine stopped and I get a
text from the researcher,

2303
01:47:09,481 --> 01:47:10,590
Hey,
the machine broke.

2304
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,290
And I said,
check the software and turns out

2305
01:47:13,291 --> 01:47:16,500
software was written to stop at three
kilometers because no mouse had run that

2306
01:47:16,501 --> 01:47:17,334
far before.

2307
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:19,770
That's long.
And those are all nice.

2308
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:21,930
Don't forget,
these are mice that are the equivalent

2309
01:47:21,931 --> 01:47:24,360
of a 65 year old human.
Really?

2310
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,760
Yeah.
And we figured out why they run further.

2311
01:47:26,910 --> 01:47:31,170
This isn't just try it and see.
We figured out that,

2312
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:34,350
that the lining of the blood vessels
needs an id as you get older,

2313
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:36,870
but they needed all the time.
But as you get older you don't have

2314
01:47:36,871 --> 01:47:40,500
enough net.
So the Nmn replenishes that and allows

2315
01:47:40,501 --> 01:47:45,501
the blood vessel lining to respond to
exercise and even grow blood vessels if

2316
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:48,240
you don't exercise.
And so those mice,

2317
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:51,150
they ran and ran and ran,
that didn't get lactate build up as

2318
01:47:51,151 --> 01:47:53,010
much.
I just didn't feel tired.

2319
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:55,200
So lactic acid buildup.
Right.

2320
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:58,650
Wow.
So muscle fatigue would be different.

2321
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:01,760
Uh,
well they didn't seem to get that

2322
01:48:01,761 --> 01:48:02,720
either.
Wow.

2323
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:07,810
Was just better blood flow.
We even pinched off an artery and the

2324
01:48:09,050 --> 01:48:12,140
body responded much better to restore
restoring blood flow,

2325
01:48:12,141 --> 01:48:14,750
which would be great for patients who
have a heart attack.

2326
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:18,020
Whoa.
Now with human beings,

2327
01:48:18,021 --> 01:48:21,080
what has been the most dramatic result?

2328
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:26,210
Uh,
that's a hard question because a lot of

2329
01:48:26,211 --> 01:48:28,100
it's early stage.
Um,

2330
01:48:29,390 --> 01:48:34,390
we developed a molecule that seemed to
effectively treat a disease called

2331
01:48:35,481 --> 01:48:37,640
psoriasis,
which is the information.

2332
01:48:37,690 --> 01:48:38,980
Has that.
Yeah.

2333
01:48:38,981 --> 01:48:39,740
So that,
that,

2334
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:41,810
that worked,
and that's a molecule,

2335
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:43,730
that's something you apply to the skin.
It was a,

2336
01:48:43,731 --> 01:48:45,900
it was a pill actually.
Yeah.

2337
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,470
How does that work?
What does it doing?

2338
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:50,930
A.
So it's an activator of one of these

2339
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,540
sirtuins that we found in yeast
originally.

2340
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:58,210
These are two and protective enzymes in
the body and there antiinflammatory.

2341
01:48:58,250 --> 01:49:00,320
And so that worked well against that
disease.

2342
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:03,440
So psoriasis has something to do with
inflammation.

2343
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:05,770
It is an inflammatory disorder.
Yep.

2344
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,920
Um,
are all autoimmune disorders Antifa or

2345
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:12,620
inflammatory based disorders?
I believe so.

2346
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:14,150
Really interesting.

2347
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:16,253
Hey,

2348
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,670
[inaudible],
I have a little ego.

2349
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:22,180
You don't see the little spots on my
skin where I don't have any pigment.

2350
01:49:22,450 --> 01:49:24,070
It's genetic.
My grandmother had it,

2351
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:26,240
my grandmother sister had it.
Um,

2352
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:29,510
I wonder if that would help me
a.

2353
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:31,360
yeah,
I really couldn't say.

2354
01:49:31,450 --> 01:49:33,340
What's it called again?
Which one?

2355
01:49:33,370 --> 01:49:35,400
Third drug that was tested.
Um,

2356
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,840
it has an srt.
Twenty one.

2357
01:49:37,841 --> 01:49:41,140
Oh four.
And this is the stuff that worked on

2358
01:49:41,141 --> 01:49:46,141
psoriasis in a small study in New York.
Now what other,

2359
01:49:47,951 --> 01:49:51,460
um,
what other things had really a dramatic

2360
01:49:51,461 --> 01:49:52,930
results on humans?
Well,

2361
01:49:52,931 --> 01:49:55,120
we're not there yet.
We don't have traumatic results.

2362
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:59,800
Is there anything promising results on
humans or than Nmn and yes,

2363
01:49:59,801 --> 01:50:01,350
there are there.
So this mtor,

2364
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:03,970
I mentioned earlier where the drug
rapamycin,

2365
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:06,130
which is too dangerous to try on normal
people.

2366
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:11,590
That drug has been tried on elderly
people and it boosted their immune

2367
01:50:11,591 --> 01:50:16,030
system in the same way that you see with
calorie restricted mice and so that that

2368
01:50:16,031 --> 01:50:18,040
was an,
an early signal that you might be able

2369
01:50:18,041 --> 01:50:20,380
to reverse aspects of aging and the
elderly with that truck.

2370
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:22,870
Now,
with older folks,

2371
01:50:22,871 --> 01:50:27,580
one thing you see is the body doesn't
produce Collagen as much.

2372
01:50:27,581 --> 01:50:32,581
Your skin gets lax and starts to sag.
What,

2373
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:38,550
what things could be done to mitigate
that I'm eating besides botox and stuff.

2374
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:40,570
Well,
Botox doesn't really do.

2375
01:50:40,571 --> 01:50:43,660
That just freezes your face like aware
as well.

2376
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:45,040
So I'm asked that a lot.
Will it?

2377
01:50:45,650 --> 01:50:48,070
I'm David,
don't worry about protecting cancer,

2378
01:50:48,071 --> 01:50:49,230
heart disease,
Alzheimer's.

2379
01:50:49,231 --> 01:50:50,800
So I look better.
Can I look better?

2380
01:50:50,801 --> 01:50:51,880
Yeah.
Right?

2381
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:52,720
Uh,
and the,

2382
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:55,900
the answer is that a,
we don't know,

2383
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:57,430
a B,
we're working on it.

2384
01:50:57,490 --> 01:51:00,400
We have,
we work with a cosmetic company that so

2385
01:51:00,401 --> 01:51:01,940
far so good.
Um,

2386
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:04,570
but I don't endorse products.
That's not me.

2387
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:07,210
But also what's interesting is that
these mice,

2388
01:51:07,211 --> 01:51:09,250
at least they stay younger looking as
well.

2389
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:12,100
They don't just live longer.
Um,

2390
01:51:12,210 --> 01:51:15,280
so this hope that something,
the skin is a big organ.

2391
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:16,200
Okay.
So,

2392
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:18,640
right.
Why wouldn't it stay young just like the

2393
01:51:18,641 --> 01:51:20,950
rest of the body?
Well,

2394
01:51:20,951 --> 01:51:23,410
it certainly indicative of whether or
not a person's healthy,

2395
01:51:23,411 --> 01:51:25,180
right?
If you see someone in their skin is

2396
01:51:25,181 --> 01:51:29,200
really saggy and fucked up looking,
you assume that persons not healthy.

2397
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:31,390
Right?
Um,

2398
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:35,320
and actually a lot of us scientists
believe that how you look is actually

2399
01:51:35,321 --> 01:51:37,600
pretty good indicator of your biological
age.

2400
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,190
Speaking,
biological age,

2401
01:51:39,191 --> 01:51:42,130
there's a been a breakthrough the last
few years being able to tell your

2402
01:51:42,131 --> 01:51:45,840
biological age.
I'm one part's done by inside tracker

2403
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:49,300
looking at blood biomarkers,
but there's a new one called the DNA

2404
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:50,980
cluck.
You heard about this?

2405
01:51:51,010 --> 01:51:52,600
Yes.
I have a.

2406
01:51:52,601 --> 01:51:55,200
So a colleague of mine is well known for
it,

2407
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:58,280
Steve Horvath,
and what it is is uh,

2408
01:51:58,450 --> 01:52:03,280
so you know,
how DNA I said is changing over time and

2409
01:52:03,281 --> 01:52:05,920
the epigenome is changing.
So these are like scratches on the

2410
01:52:05,921 --> 01:52:07,000
clock,
uh,

2411
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:07,900
on,
on the DVD.

2412
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:12,430
We think we know what those scratches
are and how to remove them and what they

2413
01:52:12,431 --> 01:52:15,400
are a little chemicals that bind to the
DNA called methyls.

2414
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:20,710
And the older you get the momentum you
accumulate on your DNA and we can read

2415
01:52:20,711 --> 01:52:25,711
that with machine and we can very
precisely say you're roughly this age,

2416
01:52:26,830 --> 01:52:30,970
but you're actually older or younger for
your chronological age

2417
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:36,610
and now we think we can reverse that.
Wow.

2418
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:39,370
How long do you think you are away from
doing that?

2419
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:41,110
Being able to reverse that.
Well,

2420
01:52:41,111 --> 01:52:43,660
that's that glaucoma treatment that
we're looking at.

2421
01:52:43,870 --> 01:52:48,870
I would like to see,
take someone like a wealthy Mel Gibson

2422
01:52:49,701 --> 01:52:52,490
type character and just shoot them up
with everything,

2423
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:58,180
like just get someone who's willing to
give you a full run of them and run it

2424
01:52:58,871 --> 01:53:00,860
like a,
some sort of a science fiction movie.

2425
01:53:00,861 --> 01:53:03,860
Tell you what,
I'll do it if you'll employ me because

2426
01:53:03,861 --> 01:53:04,880
I'll be kicked out of my job.

2427
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:08,780
I'm sure you would.
But man,

2428
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:11,540
I mean it just seems like there's so
many promising things.

2429
01:53:11,541 --> 01:53:14,990
It would be really fascinating if you
could document that you could take one

2430
01:53:14,991 --> 01:53:16,610
person.
It was like a,

2431
01:53:16,611 --> 01:53:19,880
a wealthy man in his mid to late
sixties.

2432
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:24,020
Well,
there's this forage element in anti

2433
01:53:24,021 --> 01:53:24,531
aging.
In fact,

2434
01:53:24,531 --> 01:53:28,130
I don't even like the term anti aging.
It's what do you like a longevity

2435
01:53:28,131 --> 01:53:29,140
research?
Um,

2436
01:53:29,770 --> 01:53:32,840
we're,
we're about to announce maybe this a

2437
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:37,841
sneak preview for everybody,
an academy for Aging Research of the top

2438
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,820
20 scientists in the world of banding
together to,

2439
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:42,343
to,
uh,

2440
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:45,300
produce white papers and opinions.
Um,

2441
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:49,520
but yet we call it longevity research.
And so anti aging is,

2442
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:52,640
is more that the botox and that kind of
stuff,

2443
01:53:52,641 --> 01:53:54,350
that we don't want anything to do it
right.

2444
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:56,870
But that's nonsense.
It's not really anti aging.

2445
01:53:56,990 --> 01:53:59,750
You're not doing anything about age and
you just freezing your skin's.

2446
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:01,520
What doesn't move?
That is.

2447
01:54:01,550 --> 01:54:05,030
That to me is one of the weirder things,
especially with men.

2448
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:07,130
When I see a man,
his forehead doesn't move.

2449
01:54:07,131 --> 01:54:08,870
I want to smack him in the mouth.
Like,

2450
01:54:08,871 --> 01:54:13,130
what's wrong with you sir?
How dare you smack it just,

2451
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:14,500
it's not,
it's a,

2452
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:18,920
it's not like botox or fillers or any of
those things.

2453
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:24,160
You're not doing anything for your
health or your actual real vitality.

2454
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:27,260
You're just weirdly doing something
cosmetic,

2455
01:54:28,180 --> 01:54:28,821
right?
Yes,

2456
01:54:28,821 --> 01:54:32,900
you are.
And so I think the defense is you feel

2457
01:54:32,901 --> 01:54:35,930
better if you look better
psychologically it might help.

2458
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:38,210
I don't think they look better though.
They just look different.

2459
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:40,070
Yeah.
Well that's the problem.

2460
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:41,870
It is true.
Um,

2461
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:42,641
yeah,
I,

2462
01:54:42,641 --> 01:54:47,240
I don't spend a lot of time thinking
about the cosmetic industry for obvious

2463
01:54:47,241 --> 01:54:49,200
reasons.
I'm trying to save humanity and,

2464
01:54:49,470 --> 01:54:51,920
and improve the planet.
Um,

2465
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:53,420
I actually,
I do think we will,

2466
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:55,270
we will be judged as a,
uh,

2467
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:57,530
as a species if an alien came down and
they said,

2468
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:00,050
you're shooting botulism in your face
fries.

2469
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:01,220
Right,
exactly.

2470
01:55:01,221 --> 01:55:03,530
You are a weird,
you're not allowed in the club have

2471
01:55:03,531 --> 01:55:06,980
advanced species.
Well that would only be one thing that

2472
01:55:06,981 --> 01:55:09,610
we were weird from.
But what would,

2473
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:10,650
what would they ask you?
They,

2474
01:55:10,730 --> 01:55:11,720
well,
they'd ask us,

2475
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:14,840
have you figured out the speed of light?
They had asked me why I have drawings

2476
01:55:14,841 --> 01:55:17,060
all over my arm.
No,

2477
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:20,000
no.
They might appreciate art maybe,

2478
01:55:20,450 --> 01:55:23,070
but like they'd be like,
why didn't you just get it and then just

2479
01:55:23,110 --> 01:55:26,380
wash it off or something.
You have to get it drilled in your skin

2480
01:55:26,850 --> 01:55:29,630
that's coming.
But I think one of the most important

2481
01:55:29,631 --> 01:55:34,631
questions they'd ask to tell if we are
an advanced nation or pants species is,

2482
01:55:34,911 --> 01:55:37,900
have you figured out aging yet?
Right.

2483
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:41,360
Deterioration.
And we're so pathetic as a species.

2484
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:43,830
Our answer would be,
you mean that's a thing.

2485
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:48,300
You can do something about that and
they'll come back in a thousand years.

2486
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,770
Well,
I mean there's got.

2487
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,830
How many people do you think worldwide
are working in your field?

2488
01:55:54,860 --> 01:55:56,420
Uh,
so in terms of leading labs,

2489
01:55:56,421 --> 01:55:58,820
there's about 20,
30,

2490
01:55:59,570 --> 01:56:01,820
broadly.
There's a probably a few hundred labs

2491
01:56:02,030 --> 01:56:05,180
and other,
all essentially the same field of study.

2492
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:09,230
They're all working with the same
molecules and the same parameters.

2493
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:12,260
I know that not everyone works with
molecules,

2494
01:56:12,261 --> 01:56:14,840
but what I can tell you is we get
together in conferences and we talk

2495
01:56:14,841 --> 01:56:18,710
about discovering new chain that extends
lifespan and a new molecule that's

2496
01:56:18,711 --> 01:56:23,270
working in mice or sometimes in humans,
but it's a big field now.

2497
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:25,500
It's grown.
And when I started it was the backwater

2498
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:30,320
of biology and oxidants,
etc. I was very lucky to start when it

2499
01:56:30,321 --> 01:56:35,321
was really small and stick it out.
Those faIr amount of criticism in those

2500
01:56:35,330 --> 01:56:36,290
days.
what,

2501
01:56:36,291 --> 01:56:37,390
how,
so like that.

2502
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:41,090
It was like a lot of my friends,
my supervisor said I was insane for

2503
01:56:41,091 --> 01:56:42,560
working on aging.
That's not a thing.

2504
01:56:42,561 --> 01:56:44,600
That's not biology really.

2505
01:56:44,690 --> 01:56:45,720
Yeah.
Wow.

2506
01:56:45,721 --> 01:56:46,940
Wait,
how long ago was this?

2507
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:50,020
uh,
so I came to the us from sydney in 1995.

2508
01:56:50,630 --> 01:56:55,040
Went to mit and the scientists in the
lab that I joined,

2509
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:58,910
lenny guarantee's lab,
they two students had just started

2510
01:56:58,911 --> 01:57:03,911
working to figure out why east get old
and I joined as the third senior person

2511
01:57:04,101 --> 01:57:06,770
to join and all the other people in the
lab.

2512
01:57:06,771 --> 01:57:08,810
There were about 18,
19 people.

2513
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:10,970
They said,
you are nuts.

2514
01:57:11,210 --> 01:57:13,340
Lenny's lost his mind.
He's working on aging.

2515
01:57:13,341 --> 01:57:15,080
That's not a thing.
You should be working on what we do,

2516
01:57:15,081 --> 01:57:16,820
which is understanding how genes are
regulated.

2517
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:20,960
So I called up my mom and I said,
I think I've made a big mistake here.

2518
01:57:20,961 --> 01:57:24,800
I thought this was the thing and the guy
and everyone here says he's nuts.

2519
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:28,200
Meanwhile,
you were right.

2520
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:31,920
Well,
you gotta take some risks in life.

2521
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:33,330
That's one lesson.
Yeah,

2522
01:57:33,331 --> 01:57:34,710
but that's an interesting one,
right?

2523
01:57:34,711 --> 01:57:37,140
Because you were a young fellow.
He didn't really.

2524
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:38,670
Totally.
No.

2525
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:41,610
It was pretty lucky because I'm in
Australia.

2526
01:57:41,611 --> 01:57:43,230
Right.
I don't know what people are saying

2527
01:57:43,231 --> 01:57:46,120
about this lab up there.
Oh,

2528
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:48,810
but always been fascinated with aging
since I was four.

2529
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:53,100
Well now though,
with all the promising new discoveries,

2530
01:57:53,101 --> 01:57:56,790
I mean they.
They have to be eating crow as it were.

2531
01:57:58,820 --> 01:57:59,930
Talk to those people.
I go,

2532
01:57:59,931 --> 01:58:00,711
hey,
fuck face.

2533
01:58:00,711 --> 01:58:01,770
I was right.
No,

2534
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:03,650
don't call him up in the middle of the
night.

2535
01:58:04,730 --> 01:58:06,160
Drunk.
No,

2536
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:10,160
I definiTely forgive people too much and
had some pretty big enemies along the

2537
01:58:10,161 --> 01:58:11,540
way,
but I try to be nice.

2538
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:16,630
Is it because of research and this sort
of scientific work is so competitive?

2539
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:18,740
Yeah,
it is.

2540
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:20,570
It isn't.
There's this belief that someone's

2541
01:58:20,571 --> 01:58:23,600
success is your failure.
It's not really that that is the case,

2542
01:58:23,601 --> 01:58:28,601
but it exists in show business too.
It's so weird sort of a mindset.

2543
01:58:28,671 --> 01:58:31,730
It's a very limiting mindset.
Right,

2544
01:58:31,731 --> 01:58:33,890
and also,
and this may be true in hollywood,

2545
01:58:33,891 --> 01:58:35,600
in science,
if you come up with a new idea when

2546
01:58:35,601 --> 01:58:38,510
you're young,
you're young turk and you're upsetting

2547
01:58:38,511 --> 01:58:42,130
the status quo on the thomas kuhn's book
on structure

2548
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:44,950
of scientific revolutions was just had
it had it right.

2549
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:47,470
He wrote in the sixties that chemistry
and physics,

2550
01:58:47,471 --> 01:58:50,230
but it applies to biology that if you
come up with a new theory that's that

2551
01:58:50,231 --> 01:58:54,130
disruptive,
the current leaders will attack you and

2552
01:58:54,131 --> 01:58:57,160
it's a period of chaos and you just have
to get through it,

2553
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:00,640
and fortunately I'd read kuhn's book and
I knew that this was normal,

2554
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:02,380
but a lot of people around me were
saying,

2555
01:59:02,810 --> 01:59:04,600
oh no,
if people are saying we're wrong and

2556
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:06,460
it's controversial,
we don't want to be controversial.

2557
01:59:06,461 --> 01:59:08,230
I'm like,
controversies,

2558
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:09,450
great,
let's.

2559
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:11,470
Let's do more of that,
and if it's not controversial,

2560
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,720
I don't Want to do it.
That is interesting.

2561
01:59:13,721 --> 01:59:16,870
Do you think that's because the people
who are the old guard or upset,

2562
01:59:16,871 --> 01:59:21,700
they didn't fight it themselves or they
upset that your new findings will make

2563
01:59:21,701 --> 01:59:23,680
their work look irrelevant?

2564
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:26,590
Yes.
It's probably a bit of both,

2565
01:59:26,591 --> 01:59:28,900
but mostly it's,
it's that they're worried that their

2566
01:59:28,901 --> 01:59:32,530
lives will be have been in vain if what
you're working on is not true.

2567
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:33,940
Right?
Yeah.

2568
01:59:33,941 --> 01:59:37,090
There's a.
there's an amazing documentary on the

2569
01:59:37,091 --> 01:59:42,091
sphinx where these geologists are
talking about some of the water erosion

2570
01:59:42,190 --> 01:59:45,760
outside the area of the sphinx and
they're saying this points to the fact

2571
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:49,120
that construction was thousands of years
older than they thought and you see this

2572
01:59:49,121 --> 01:59:52,330
one egyptologist freaking out.
He's freakIng out.

2573
01:59:52,331 --> 01:59:54,280
Like what evidence,
what evidence of this culture you're

2574
01:59:54,281 --> 01:59:55,114
talking about?
Like,

2575
01:59:55,370 --> 02:00:00,370
because apparently it would have
predated the known dates of 2,500 bc,

2576
02:00:03,210 --> 02:00:06,760
but if it made it like 7,000 years older
than that because it would have to be

2577
02:00:06,761 --> 02:00:10,780
back when there was rainfall in the nile
valley and you could see this guy's ego

2578
02:00:10,781 --> 02:00:12,700
kicking it because he was a professor.

2579
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:15,670
He had been teaching egyptology and he
was freaking out.

2580
02:00:15,671 --> 02:00:18,310
Instead of examining this evidence like
wow,

2581
02:00:18,311 --> 02:00:22,090
like talking to this geologist who
studies rocks and erosion,

2582
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:26,020
who's really steadfast is a boston
university geologists,

2583
02:00:26,170 --> 02:00:30,250
dr robert schoch and you know he's
saying this is evidence of water erosion

2584
02:00:30,251 --> 02:00:34,480
and he's showing it and he even showed
it to a bunch of other geologists and

2585
02:00:34,481 --> 02:00:38,430
they all agreed and this guy,
this egyptologist and this documentary

2586
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:39,430
was freaking out.
I was like,

2587
02:00:39,431 --> 02:00:41,920
wow.
That's what happens when you think your

2588
02:00:41,921 --> 02:00:44,440
whole life's work is horseshit.
Yeah.

2589
02:00:44,441 --> 02:00:46,840
It can be a blow to the ego.
I haven't lived through that yet.

2590
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:50,560
It's probably coming,
but what I've noticed is that the really

2591
02:00:50,561 --> 02:00:54,940
successful scientists and people in life
just embrace change and that kInd of

2592
02:00:54,941 --> 02:00:55,774
have to.
I mean,

2593
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,120
it doesn't mean that that guy is a
loser.

2594
02:00:58,330 --> 02:01:03,330
It just means he was acting on incorrect
information based on what they knew

2595
02:01:03,341 --> 02:01:03,760
before.

2596
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,860
I mean,
it should embrace it and say,

2597
02:01:05,861 --> 02:01:07,870
look,
well we know certain things were built

2598
02:01:07,871 --> 02:01:09,940
at 2,500 bc,
like the great pyramid.

2599
02:01:09,941 --> 02:01:14,080
That's been pretty clearly established,
but it looks like there was some ancient

2600
02:01:14,110 --> 02:01:16,390
structures that were there even before
then.

2601
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:19,690
Let's now we have new things to study if
they don't look at it that way though.

2602
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:21,200
Yeah.
See the problem with,

2603
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:23,980
with how biology and actually most facts
a toilet,

2604
02:01:24,450 --> 02:01:26,870
uh,
theories are taught is that there's a

2605
02:01:26,871 --> 02:01:29,800
textbook and that's the bible
equivalent.

2606
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:32,770
Uh,
whaT I try to teach my students is,

2607
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:36,460
can you please just forget everything
you just learned and what's important to

2608
02:01:36,461 --> 02:01:38,860
know is that most things we think we
know are not,

2609
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:42,230
they're going to change over time.
Old Theories change.

2610
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:44,330
Newton was wrong,
but he helped us get here,

2611
02:01:44,950 --> 02:01:48,770
uh,
expect that we only know point.

2612
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,650
Oh,
one percent of,

2613
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:53,210
of what we need to figure out and a lot
of what we think we know is wrong

2614
02:01:53,211 --> 02:01:54,044
anyway.

2615
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:57,050
So even if you have the greatest theory,
expect that it will be overturned,

2616
02:01:57,051 --> 02:02:01,340
but you can at least cherish the fact
that you've helped us get to that point.

2617
02:02:01,341 --> 02:02:03,290
Because without newton we wouldn't have
quantum physics.

2618
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:05,900
Well,
for someone like me hearing you say

2619
02:02:05,901 --> 02:02:08,060
that,
it's very promising and it's,

2620
02:02:08,061 --> 02:02:09,650
it's,
it's very encouraging.

2621
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:15,100
but I always thought that scientists
were always going on just data,

2622
02:02:18,650 --> 02:02:20,570
like the,
all they cared about was data,

2623
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:24,260
all they cared about is what is correct.
And that was what was crucial.

2624
02:02:24,530 --> 02:02:27,140
That's what's important.
This is what theY talk about.

2625
02:02:27,141 --> 02:02:30,290
This is what the study,
when I found out that scientists would,

2626
02:02:31,190 --> 02:02:36,190
would ignore information or use their
own personal biases against information

2627
02:02:36,771 --> 02:02:41,570
or attack research because it somehow
negates what they've done is very

2628
02:02:41,571 --> 02:02:44,270
disheartening for someone who's not a
scientist.

2629
02:02:44,630 --> 02:02:45,710
And you go,
oh no,

2630
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:47,750
the egos in science too,
right?

2631
02:02:47,810 --> 02:02:50,450
It's disheartening as a scientist,
I can tell you there Were,

2632
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:54,080
there was a time of great change in the
aging field where we discover genes

2633
02:02:54,081 --> 02:02:58,100
control aging and molecules like where's
virtual could extend health and

2634
02:02:58,101 --> 02:02:59,450
lifespan.
It Was,

2635
02:02:59,451 --> 02:03:00,430
it was brutal.
You,

2636
02:03:00,650 --> 02:03:02,630
I'd get up and I give a speech and
someone to say,

2637
02:03:02,990 --> 02:03:04,520
you're wrong.
This is crap.

2638
02:03:04,521 --> 02:03:07,550
And where are they now?
Do you call them up in the middle of the

2639
02:03:07,550 --> 02:03:08,300
night?
Uh,

2640
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:09,700
this dilemma,
you

2641
02:03:11,660 --> 02:03:13,710
have a couple of glasses of wine.
Yeah.

2642
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:16,320
Well,
I think the secret to success in life is

2643
02:03:16,321 --> 02:03:20,690
actually just existing for long enough
and all your enemies to fall away.

2644
02:03:21,230 --> 02:03:21,801
Well,
they die.

2645
02:03:21,801 --> 02:03:23,950
They're not into anti aging.
Yeah.

2646
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:25,870
Looks like shit and I can't walk
anymore.

2647
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:29,120
Just have to outlive your enemies.
That's an easy way.

2648
02:03:29,690 --> 02:03:33,440
That must have been a tough time though.
For you as a young man and you know,

2649
02:03:33,441 --> 02:03:34,910
you're,
you're hearing this from these

2650
02:03:34,911 --> 02:03:39,600
established scientists and part of you
must have been like thinking like

2651
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:39,840
cheese.

2652
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:41,720
Are they right?
SUre.

2653
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:43,580
You have to entertain the possibility
that you're wrong,

2654
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:45,650
that that's what we do.
Uh,

2655
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:47,390
but you go back to the lab and you
retest It.

2656
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:52,160
So I went through a really brutal period
in my career where we had data,

2657
02:03:52,161 --> 02:03:54,650
we interpreted it,
we published it in the top journals and

2658
02:03:55,220 --> 02:03:59,090
it was about how [inaudible] virtual
works on that sir to an enzyme that I

2659
02:03:59,091 --> 02:04:03,260
mentioned.
And pfizer came out with a paper that

2660
02:04:03,261 --> 02:04:07,070
said it's all wrong.
And I had people call me Up Saying,

2661
02:04:07,620 --> 02:04:08,870
you know,
it was nice knowing you.

2662
02:04:08,871 --> 02:04:11,270
I'm really sad for you,
but it's over.

2663
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:13,190
Yeah.
Bad luck.

2664
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:16,910
And so I went back to the lab,
we had some data already from yearS

2665
02:04:16,911 --> 02:04:20,600
before,
which I knew were interesting and it

2666
02:04:20,601 --> 02:04:23,660
took another thing for years to get to
the bottom of it.

2667
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:28,370
But it turns out in the end I was right.
But there were days when I said screw

2668
02:04:28,371 --> 02:04:30,260
humanity,
I couldn't be bothered getting out of

2669
02:04:30,261 --> 02:04:32,870
bed if this is how I'm going to be
treated for trying to devote my life to

2670
02:04:32,871 --> 02:04:35,720
the betterment of people's lives.
It's tough.

2671
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:37,890
I'm not,
I anybody who's

2672
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:42,720
in a position in their career like that
has to have gone through really hard

2673
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:46,230
times.
It's just discouraging from a non

2674
02:04:46,231 --> 02:04:51,231
scientist who relies on people like you.
For someone like me who relies on the

2675
02:04:52,261 --> 02:04:55,470
folks like you out there doing the hard
work that you would face,

2676
02:04:55,530 --> 02:04:59,400
that sort of.
I guess the best way to describe it

2677
02:04:59,401 --> 02:05:01,790
would be ignorance.
Well,

2678
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:03,750
it's okay for scientists to challenge a
theory.

2679
02:05:03,751 --> 02:05:06,180
That's what I did and what everybody is
trained to do.

2680
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:09,390
Uh,
but to do it in such a public end and

2681
02:05:09,850 --> 02:05:11,460
vish controversial,
it Was vicious.

2682
02:05:11,461 --> 02:05:14,250
It was definitely vicious.
Even the words they used were vicious,

2683
02:05:14,890 --> 02:05:16,650
uh,
which is really hurtful,

2684
02:05:16,651 --> 02:05:17,700
but,
but they're wrong.

2685
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:21,090
Well,
they might've been right or wrong.

2686
02:05:21,150 --> 02:05:23,850
I call them up middle of the night.
You dumb motherfucker.

2687
02:05:24,820 --> 02:05:28,470
The person who published that paper,
I do think about a meeting that person,

2688
02:05:28,471 --> 02:05:31,620
again,
a droid careers.

2689
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:33,300
it's not just,
it's tough.

2690
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:36,210
You can run out of money.
Your students go away.

2691
02:05:36,230 --> 02:05:37,620
Sure.
That was happening to my left.

2692
02:05:37,621 --> 02:05:39,470
We went down to four people.
I mean,

2693
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:40,870
and what was the high?
Uh,

2694
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:44,010
I mean these days I'm.
But what about before then?

2695
02:05:44,011 --> 02:05:46,590
It was about 80 slash 20.
And you went down to four.

2696
02:05:46,591 --> 02:05:48,240
Four.
So it was looking bad.

2697
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:50,430
Oh yeah.
People had written me off.

2698
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:53,640
Holy shit.
but you were right.

2699
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:57,480
When he got to push forward,
it's you got to get lean because you're

2700
02:05:57,481 --> 02:06:00,450
not goIng to get government funding for
awhile because people think that you're

2701
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:02,280
a failure.
God damn,

2702
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:05,340
that's crazy.
Well,

2703
02:06:05,341 --> 02:06:08,130
science is not for the faint of heart,
I would imagine.

2704
02:06:08,690 --> 02:06:09,470
Yeah.
Boy.

2705
02:06:09,470 --> 02:06:10,980
Skin,
thick skin.

2706
02:06:11,020 --> 02:06:13,950
A stubbornness only.
Only those survive.

2707
02:06:15,990 --> 02:06:19,760
What was the turnaround
like?

2708
02:06:19,770 --> 02:06:23,250
Was there a moment where it turned
around and moved in our favor?

2709
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:24,330
Yeah,
there was.

2710
02:06:24,331 --> 02:06:26,190
There was one day when it.
When it all changed,

2711
02:06:26,850 --> 02:06:30,060
so the earlier data,
so what data driven the early data was

2712
02:06:30,061 --> 02:06:35,061
that the enzyme we can we could mutate
or change the enzyme so that it wasn't

2713
02:06:36,841 --> 02:06:41,320
going to be activated by research and we
found that mutation now that just

2714
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:46,340
technically or non tickling technically
means that we could change the enzyme in

2715
02:06:46,951 --> 02:06:50,310
a way it wouldn't work,
so we didn't put that nonworking enzyme

2716
02:06:50,311 --> 02:06:55,311
into a cell and now we have a mouse that
doesn't work and we give it resveratrol

2717
02:06:55,351 --> 02:06:57,660
virtual and if it.
If it works,

2718
02:06:57,810 --> 02:07:00,210
it means I'm wrong.
If it doesn't work and it's blocked by

2719
02:07:00,211 --> 02:07:04,590
that change in the enzyme will probably
right and that's what we did.

2720
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:08,040
But the real,
the real change was that there was a

2721
02:07:08,041 --> 02:07:10,530
company that I started that was making
drugs,

2722
02:07:10,980 --> 02:07:15,980
the one that a cure or at least seemed
to cure psoriasis and they had made

2723
02:07:17,341 --> 02:07:21,060
these very synthetic molecules that were
not related to the plant molecule

2724
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:21,993
residual.

2725
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:25,950
And so I said to myself and to the
student who was working on it,

2726
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:30,900
they're very brave student if,
if the change in that enzyme also blocks

2727
02:07:30,901 --> 02:07:34,980
the drug,
then we're onto something because that

2728
02:07:34,990 --> 02:07:38,470
means two separate groups working on
separate types of molecules,

2729
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:43,270
different people,
different systems all get blocked by

2730
02:07:43,271 --> 02:07:45,970
this one little change in the enzyme,
then we're right.

2731
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:48,340
And,
and so he walked over to the company,

2732
02:07:48,341 --> 02:07:50,800
got the molecule,
throw it on the enzyme and it didn't

2733
02:07:50,801 --> 02:07:55,801
work on the mutant.
And that was me a rejoicing because I

2734
02:07:56,141 --> 02:08:00,700
could say there was a universal
activation mechanism on this one enzyme,

2735
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:03,160
rich virtual works,
uh,

2736
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:07,480
the molecules at the company work.
And now there's an interesting thing

2737
02:08:07,481 --> 02:08:10,060
that just came out from Spain that
metformin,

2738
02:08:10,330 --> 02:08:15,100
the diabetes drug may actually work the
same way as these other molecules by

2739
02:08:15,101 --> 02:08:19,180
activating our favorite enzyme,
the sirtuin wow.

2740
02:08:19,930 --> 02:08:22,370
And how,
how much time were you in the dark

2741
02:08:22,371 --> 02:08:25,770
lands?
It was a couple of years of hell,

2742
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:30,040
right?
If it gets so bad because you've got

2743
02:08:30,041 --> 02:08:33,250
this tight knit group of scientists and
you have lab meetings and you present

2744
02:08:33,251 --> 02:08:35,500
your results and usually you're very
supportive trying to help.

2745
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:40,570
I had one guy saying to my student,
david doesn't always talking about you

2746
02:08:40,571 --> 02:08:42,280
shouldn't work on this.
It's been proven wrong.

2747
02:08:42,281 --> 02:08:46,120
He was dead against me in my own lab.
I'm paying your salary and it's okay to

2748
02:08:46,121 --> 02:08:49,030
be constructive,
but vicious within my own group.

2749
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:50,500
What?
Suffice to say,

2750
02:08:50,501 --> 02:08:53,080
he wasn't in my group for that long.
Wow.

2751
02:08:53,140 --> 02:08:56,350
Now this other guy that used all these
other vicious words about you.

2752
02:08:56,440 --> 02:08:58,210
Where's he at now?
Not sure.

2753
02:08:58,990 --> 02:09:00,910
I would know.
I would know.

2754
02:09:02,290 --> 02:09:04,720
Now I don't have time to look back on
your iphone.

2755
02:09:04,721 --> 02:09:05,590
You're nicer than me.

2756
02:09:08,210 --> 02:09:09,250
Yeah.
You know what?

2757
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:13,360
I'm in science because it's very
collaborative and you're often.

2758
02:09:13,361 --> 02:09:15,790
Your enemies are reviewing your own
work.

2759
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:19,240
If you build up too many enemies,
you won't survive,

2760
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:22,720
so it's definitely healthier approach.
I'm sure I probably would do exactly

2761
02:09:22,721 --> 02:09:25,360
what you did,
but it still has got to be beautiful to

2762
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:28,540
come out on the other end and be proven.
Correct,

2763
02:09:28,541 --> 02:09:32,230
and actually be at the forefront of
these emerging technologies.

2764
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:33,201
Uh,
well,

2765
02:09:33,201 --> 02:09:33,610
it,
it,

2766
02:09:33,610 --> 02:09:36,520
it is an arm rest on any laurels,
but the,

2767
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:41,530
what I do is I pause and I remember how
hard it was to get here and how

2768
02:09:41,531 --> 02:09:45,100
fortunate I am to have made it this far
and I'm working with hundreds of

2769
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:48,040
collaborators around the world to make
this come true.

2770
02:09:48,041 --> 02:09:52,000
This idea that we can really treat aging
and prevent deterioration.

2771
02:09:52,450 --> 02:09:55,180
So I'm blessed.
I have an app on my phone that I've

2772
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:56,410
helped engineer.

2773
02:09:56,590 --> 02:09:59,280
What's that?
It's called lucy liu a.

2774
02:09:59,281 --> 02:10:02,070
And where does that?
Uh,

2775
02:10:02,300 --> 02:10:05,140
well it's,
it's a little company that we bought in

2776
02:10:05,141 --> 02:10:10,141
New York and uh,
nurses and dentists use it to pass

2777
02:10:11,381 --> 02:10:15,550
medical information around,
but we use it to share information

2778
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:20,080
between scientists around the world and
coordinate activities between companies

2779
02:10:20,250 --> 02:10:21,790
that started.
Yeah.

2780
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:23,440
So I,
you know,

2781
02:10:23,441 --> 02:10:26,020
I think I mentioned to you that I've
started a few companies.

2782
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:29,920
What I'm trying to build our companies
that are the 21st century version of a

2783
02:10:29,921 --> 02:10:34,921
pharma company that is actually has a
decent reputation in the world.

2784
02:10:35,330 --> 02:10:38,300
I think it's pharmaceutical companies,
whether it's deserved or not,

2785
02:10:38,301 --> 02:10:41,270
have a pretty bad rap.
I'm trying not to fall into that trap,

2786
02:10:41,271 --> 02:10:45,110
but I'm also trying to use 21st century
technology to not become too

2787
02:10:45,111 --> 02:10:47,450
bureaucratic as well within the
organization.

2788
02:10:47,490 --> 02:10:49,370
That's what the luma app offers us.

2789
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:51,740
You were also talking,
I don't know if you could talk about

2790
02:10:51,741 --> 02:10:55,130
this before the podcast,
about how you have to make sure you have

2791
02:10:55,131 --> 02:10:56,750
zero conflicts of interest.

2792
02:10:58,780 --> 02:10:59,291
Yeah,
it's hard.

2793
02:10:59,291 --> 02:11:01,720
So I don't,
I don't sell any supplements.

2794
02:11:01,721 --> 02:11:03,280
I don't endorse anything.
Um,

2795
02:11:03,340 --> 02:11:05,470
no products.
But if you look on the internet,

2796
02:11:05,471 --> 02:11:08,560
if you google david sinclair and nad or
aging,

2797
02:11:08,561 --> 02:11:12,130
you'll see that people put my name and
my face all the time on their websites

2798
02:11:12,131 --> 02:11:15,280
and I get questions every day.
Every morning I wake up.

2799
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:20,940
Which product are you endorsing?
And so I have to be extremely careful.

2800
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:23,740
So do you have to have your lawyer
contact those companies?

2801
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:26,250
Tell them to take your name?
Yeah,

2802
02:11:26,630 --> 02:11:28,540
it's a,
it's a fair amount of money always

2803
02:11:28,541 --> 02:11:31,270
sending out cease and desist letters,
but I have to do it.

2804
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:34,870
My reputation is everything.
And also want to be able to have

2805
02:11:34,871 --> 02:11:39,600
opinions on these molecules without
someone accusing me of doing it for

2806
02:11:39,610 --> 02:11:39,970
profit.

2807
02:11:39,970 --> 02:11:42,700
That's what I would think would be
because of anybody could point to that

2808
02:11:42,701 --> 02:11:43,420
and say,
hey,

2809
02:11:43,420 --> 02:11:45,910
he endorses this because he's making
money.

2810
02:11:46,070 --> 02:11:46,903
Yeah.
Yeah.

2811
02:11:48,130 --> 02:11:49,810
That's what would be.
Yeah,

2812
02:11:49,811 --> 02:11:53,200
that would be the thing that means
especially because most people aren't

2813
02:11:53,201 --> 02:11:57,700
going to do real research and developed
a nuanced understanding of your work and

2814
02:11:57,701 --> 02:12:00,430
what you're doing and what it means and
how long you've been studying it.

2815
02:12:00,730 --> 02:12:01,271
They go,
oh,

2816
02:12:01,271 --> 02:12:03,190
he's doing it because he's making money.
I'm done

2817
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:04,450
now.
Right.

2818
02:12:04,450 --> 02:12:04,841
Well,
you know,

2819
02:12:04,841 --> 02:12:06,820
I've made a fair amount of money in my
life.

2820
02:12:06,821 --> 02:12:09,310
My first company,
even though it wasn't the major

2821
02:12:09,311 --> 02:12:11,440
shareholder,
was sold for north of 700,

2822
02:12:11,441 --> 02:12:15,250
$20,000,000.
So that money I'm not immune to,

2823
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:19,690
but I do reinvest almost all of it.
Actually all of it.

2824
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:23,590
My wife will tell you into new ventures
to change the world.

2825
02:12:23,591 --> 02:12:28,150
So the lyme disease company and the miv
66 company metro.

2826
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:32,110
These are funded initially by me.
Now the conflict arises because I'm

2827
02:12:32,111 --> 02:12:35,470
studying these molecules in the lab and
I'm on the board of directors and

2828
02:12:35,471 --> 02:12:37,480
advising these companies as chairman,
vice chairman,

2829
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:40,480
the only way around that as a scientist
that we,

2830
02:12:41,190 --> 02:12:42,690
uh,
that we have is our defenses.

2831
02:12:42,730 --> 02:12:46,990
We disclose everything.
So initially I would disclose it to the

2832
02:12:46,991 --> 02:12:50,020
government and to harvard.
All scientists have to do that,

2833
02:12:50,021 --> 02:12:54,190
but I've gone a step further just to try
and beat ultra transparent with the

2834
02:12:54,191 --> 02:12:54,940
public.

2835
02:12:54,940 --> 02:12:57,100
And so I have a website.
If you go to my lab's website,

2836
02:12:57,101 --> 02:12:59,650
you'll see everything that I do and,
um,

2837
02:12:59,890 --> 02:13:04,890
and hopefully that's a protection from
being accused of being biased.

2838
02:13:05,351 --> 02:13:09,400
But what I definitely do in my lab is I
say to the students,

2839
02:13:09,490 --> 02:13:13,270
if you get a whiff that I'm doing
anything biased,

2840
02:13:13,271 --> 02:13:14,650
I would,
I wouldn't do anything consciously,

2841
02:13:14,651 --> 02:13:17,380
but maybe there's some unconscious bias,
let me know,

2842
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:21,400
let the university know and we'd find.
But I've been doing this for 25 years.

2843
02:13:21,870 --> 02:13:24,790
Uh,
I think I'm pretty good at putting a,

2844
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:27,660
a wall between the two.
Um,

2845
02:13:28,270 --> 02:13:31,030
and the other thing that I want
everybody to know is in the,

2846
02:13:31,230 --> 02:13:33,780
we do very basic research.
We try to understand the fundamental

2847
02:13:34,110 --> 02:13:35,940
reasons why we age and how to reverse
it.

2848
02:13:36,570 --> 02:13:39,060
The companies are more worried about how
we're going to do a clinical trial,

2849
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:41,640
which is very different worlds,
so they don't overlap much.

2850
02:13:42,420 --> 02:13:46,510
now when you want to bring something to
try or something to the market or do you

2851
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:50,070
want to try somethIng on people?
What's the process like?

2852
02:13:50,071 --> 02:13:54,810
Say if you have some sort of a molecule
that you want to try out on people,

2853
02:13:54,811 --> 02:13:57,330
what is that process?
Uh,

2854
02:13:57,331 --> 02:14:01,470
so it's a few years have often making it
better molecule.

2855
02:14:01,471 --> 02:14:06,471
But let's say you've done that work now.
You spent a year testing it on at least

2856
02:14:06,631 --> 02:14:08,940
two different species.
I'm usually a rodent,

2857
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:14,100
a mouse and a dog and,
but you try to do everything you can

2858
02:14:14,101 --> 02:14:16,110
before that to make sure it's not going
to be unsafe.

2859
02:14:16,350 --> 02:14:20,420
Testing on cells and other things that
are not living or at least not,

2860
02:14:20,550 --> 02:14:25,320
not to feel anything,
but the fda food and drug administration

2861
02:14:25,321 --> 02:14:27,360
of the us requires.
If you can make a drug,

2862
02:14:27,361 --> 02:14:29,430
you have to test it on at least two
different species,

2863
02:14:29,670 --> 02:14:33,300
so that's what you do and then it's you
go into what's called phase one,

2864
02:14:33,301 --> 02:14:36,180
which is safety testing takes one to two
years.

2865
02:14:36,630 --> 02:14:40,080
Phase two is what we call efficacy,
which is does it really work?

2866
02:14:40,110 --> 02:14:43,530
Potentially,
so you test that on 50 to 100 people.

2867
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:45,540
Maybe it works,
maybe it doesn't.

2868
02:14:45,541 --> 02:14:47,610
Most things fail.
If it looks good,

2869
02:14:47,611 --> 02:14:51,390
then you go into phase three,
which is 50 to $200,000,000 worth of

2870
02:14:51,391 --> 02:14:56,391
experiments and testing it on hundreds
of patients and if that goes well,

2871
02:14:56,431 --> 02:15:00,210
then you apply to the fda to be licensed
to sell a drug.

2872
02:15:00,450 --> 02:15:05,450
So the amount of money that it must cost
to bring something to mr years open

2873
02:15:06,371 --> 02:15:07,940
neural or who?
It's.

2874
02:15:08,180 --> 02:15:09,930
It's hard.
It must be staggering.

2875
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:14,340
It's staggering to raise that much money
and that that's one of the reasons that

2876
02:15:14,850 --> 02:15:16,110
these big numbers come up.

2877
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:21,960
Often we have to tap the public markets
to be able to afford it because a

2878
02:15:21,961 --> 02:15:25,260
typical drug will cost hundreds of
millions of dollars.

2879
02:15:25,650 --> 02:15:28,110
Some drugs have failed after
$700,000,000 investment.

2880
02:15:28,170 --> 02:15:29,820
Oh yeah.
But,

2881
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:33,180
but look at the upside.
If we're successful at having a drug

2882
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:38,730
that treats aging
will treat a disease like diabetes

2883
02:15:38,731 --> 02:15:41,520
first,
but then it could become the best

2884
02:15:41,521 --> 02:15:44,220
selling drug of all time if it's proven
safe.

2885
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:47,280
Who,
who wouldn't want to have a drug that

2886
02:15:47,281 --> 02:15:49,230
could protect them from all these major
diseases?

2887
02:15:49,590 --> 02:15:51,240
Yeah.
But how much would something where you'd

2888
02:15:51,241 --> 02:15:55,170
have to sell it for so much wanted to
make makeup for all the research money,

2889
02:15:55,171 --> 02:15:56,490
right?
Is how it works.

2890
02:15:57,660 --> 02:16:01,220
That's how it usually works.
But for the first time I'm,

2891
02:16:01,270 --> 02:16:05,310
I'm in control of many of these
companies and I have a large say in them

2892
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:09,780
at least.
And I as an individual,

2893
02:16:09,781 --> 02:16:11,520
um,
and pledging that we won't do that.

2894
02:16:11,670 --> 02:16:15,900
We're not going to put our prices up to
what the market can bear.

2895
02:16:15,901 --> 02:16:18,000
We want.
This is a gift to the world.

2896
02:16:18,001 --> 02:16:20,490
And so that's a very different approach.
And it's one of the reasons that I've

2897
02:16:21,150 --> 02:16:23,580
enlarged part,
used my own money to do these things so

2898
02:16:23,581 --> 02:16:26,100
I can have that say and do what's right
for the planet.

2899
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:30,130
So when you do do that,
how you decide

2900
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:34,870
how much something costs based on the
ability to just maintain the company?

2901
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:35,950
Well,
yeah,

2902
02:16:35,950 --> 02:16:37,720
we have to be profitable,
otherwise it'll,

2903
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:39,100
it'll goes away,
right?

2904
02:16:39,270 --> 02:16:41,050
Um,
but not to.

2905
02:16:41,051 --> 02:16:43,720
The point of extortion note is there's a
nice middle ground and what?

2906
02:16:43,721 --> 02:16:45,100
Right.
You don't want to be like that guy that

2907
02:16:45,101 --> 02:16:47,500
went to jail for the aids drug.
What's set assholes name,

2908
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:52,540
you know,
that kid you squarely cotton's

2909
02:16:52,580 --> 02:16:53,830
currently,
uh,

2910
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:55,510
you know,
I've had very different view and I'm

2911
02:16:55,511 --> 02:16:59,110
hoping that we'll have a new type of
pharmaceutical company emerging out of

2912
02:16:59,111 --> 02:17:01,930
what we're doing.
That's amazing,

2913
02:17:01,931 --> 02:17:03,640
right?
Because pharmaceutical drug companies

2914
02:17:03,641 --> 02:17:06,010
are always thought as being a devil.
Meanwhile,

2915
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:09,430
They're responsible for so many things
to keep people alive as well.

2916
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:13,270
But because of the fact they're
connected to things like oxycontin and

2917
02:17:13,271 --> 02:17:17,110
fentanyl and things that kill people.
And it's been proven that there are

2918
02:17:17,111 --> 02:17:21,580
certain unscrupulous drug companies that
have pushed things out there that they

2919
02:17:21,581 --> 02:17:24,460
know have negative effects because they
knew they could profit from it.

2920
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:26,320
Right.
Well,

2921
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:30,580
not everybody's ethical,
but as long as I have a say in these

2922
02:17:30,581 --> 02:17:32,200
companies,
they will be ultra ethical.

2923
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:34,030
You've got to make sure that you stay
alive.

2924
02:17:34,090 --> 02:17:35,590
They're going to try to take you out,
bro.

2925
02:17:36,110 --> 02:17:37,280
Hell yeah.
Uh,

2926
02:17:37,330 --> 02:17:40,120
I don't know about that,
but take control of the company.

2927
02:17:40,690 --> 02:17:43,810
I've found prophets.
I found like minded investors for the

2928
02:17:43,811 --> 02:17:45,460
first time.
That's amazing too.

2929
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:46,240
I mean,
how,

2930
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:49,470
how have you managed to cultivate that
relationships?

2931
02:17:50,110 --> 02:17:53,680
It's harder than going with a pitch to a
capitalist,

2932
02:17:53,681 --> 02:17:54,600
but,
uh,

2933
02:17:54,850 --> 02:17:59,800
it's mainly meeting the right people.
I want to say that they're on board too.

2934
02:17:59,980 --> 02:18:02,200
I don't want to just have somebody who's
out to make a profit.

2935
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:03,820
Right.
But you still can make a profit

2936
02:18:04,570 --> 02:18:08,630
profitable but don't go crazy.
Right.

2937
02:18:09,130 --> 02:18:10,450
Help the world.
Yeah.

2938
02:18:10,451 --> 02:18:13,600
And so we just recruited to one of the
boards of the company,

2939
02:18:13,630 --> 02:18:17,380
someone from a consumer company,
which is a strange choice,

2940
02:18:17,381 --> 02:18:18,100
right?

2941
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:21,070
But this is a person who's done right at
that company for the world.

2942
02:18:21,690 --> 02:18:24,970
I'm a company that used to make just
some,

2943
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:27,130
uh,
because you want products that weren't

2944
02:18:27,131 --> 02:18:31,630
healthy and he turned that around and
that's the kind of person I want to work

2945
02:18:31,631 --> 02:18:33,130
with.
Who cares about the pLanet more than

2946
02:18:33,131 --> 02:18:36,430
they care about the ultimate profit.
That's awesome man.

2947
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:37,980
Listen,
keep me.

2948
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:40,590
Keep me in the loop.
I want to know what's going on and I'm

2949
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:41,890
gonna.
Try all these things that you said.

2950
02:18:41,891 --> 02:18:44,890
So I'm going to go out.
I'm going to buy some nmn.

2951
02:18:45,220 --> 02:18:50,170
I'm going to buy some resveratrol.
I gotta find a quack that's willing to

2952
02:18:50,171 --> 02:18:51,670
prescribe me.
Metformin.

2953
02:18:53,290 --> 02:18:56,170
Got shade.
We'll talk later.

2954
02:18:56,710 --> 02:18:58,300
Um,
and then the other stuff,

2955
02:18:58,301 --> 02:18:59,980
the srt 21.
Oh,

2956
02:18:59,981 --> 02:19:02,020
four.
That stuff.

2957
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:04,840
Where would one get that?
That's experimental.

2958
02:19:04,841 --> 02:19:06,730
That's probably the hardest one to help
you with.

2959
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:10,150
You need to pay somebody off.
Um,

2960
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:14,830
anything else I need to know about?
Said it.

2961
02:19:15,010 --> 02:19:19,120
Have you had you just 23 and me
basically,

2962
02:19:19,270 --> 02:19:20,140
you know,
I haven't.

2963
02:19:20,290 --> 02:19:23,440
Is there more extensive versions of it
than that?

2964
02:19:23,980 --> 02:19:25,030
There are.
I mean,

2965
02:19:25,220 --> 02:19:27,620
they're a few thousand bucks to you hold
genome and we can do that,

2966
02:19:27,621 --> 02:19:30,800
but I don't think you'll learn a lot
more mainly because we're ignorant as to

2967
02:19:30,801 --> 02:19:32,330
what the other staff's doing.
Right.

2968
02:19:32,420 --> 02:19:36,920
It was pretty interesting though as far
as finding out about my ancestry and

2969
02:19:36,950 --> 02:19:38,900
where my relatives come from.
Yeah,

2970
02:19:38,990 --> 02:19:42,020
it's a good start.
I learned some really interesting things

2971
02:19:42,030 --> 02:19:46,360
too about my origins and I'm carrying
cystic fibrosis gene and whatever.

2972
02:19:46,390 --> 02:19:49,790
Wow.
But what's cool is now emerging,

2973
02:19:49,850 --> 02:19:54,560
you can merge that data with the inside
tracker data and have this ultimate

2974
02:19:55,160 --> 02:19:58,390
personal angel for health that will,
uh,

2975
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:02,540
hopefully one day be on all of us that
we've got the personal tracking device.

2976
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:04,280
IT'll tell us if there's something going
wrong.

2977
02:20:04,281 --> 02:20:06,620
If you are a cancer cell detected,
go get that eliminated.

2978
02:20:07,130 --> 02:20:09,350
It's crazy these days.
We have to wait till there's an actually

2979
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:12,260
a tumor that's making you sick before
you actually go to the doctor.

2980
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:15,590
An actual issue.
Well now I know why you're so excited

2981
02:20:15,591 --> 02:20:19,370
about the future.
So you have an inside track on this.

2982
02:20:19,770 --> 02:20:20,810
Yeah.
Front row seat.

2983
02:20:20,811 --> 02:20:22,790
And I'm glad to share a little bit with
your listeners.

2984
02:20:22,820 --> 02:20:23,391
Oh,
thank You.

2985
02:20:23,391 --> 02:20:24,560
I really,
really appreciate it.

2986
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:28,310
Tell the listeners and the viewers what
your website is.

2987
02:20:29,950 --> 02:20:32,660
I just have a harvard website,
but I will be.

2988
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:35,420
I'll tweet about this.
I'm launching a website for a book that

2989
02:20:35,930 --> 02:20:38,630
I planned that I'm writing now and it's
going to come out later this year.

2990
02:20:38,631 --> 02:20:40,850
We hope when it comes out,
come on back.

2991
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:43,220
I would love to give an update.
Thank you,

2992
02:20:43,221 --> 02:20:43,701
david.
Really,

2993
02:20:43,701 --> 02:20:45,920
really appreciate it.
That's it.

2994
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:46,610
Bye everybody.
