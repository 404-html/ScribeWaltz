1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,450
Real good experience.

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,820
No idea what time?

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,713
No.

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,370
No concept of it.

5
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:26,770
Yeah,

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,491
it's fun to have.

7
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:30,120
Then it becomes like a
little man cave type.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,900
The waffles were sacks

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,903
tightly wound.

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,810
What do get lower now

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,970
what it is is shit.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,433
Depression.

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,070
I'm hiding your,

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,360
your putting the pressure
on yourself right now.

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,020
Think all my fucking money
back from Catholic school.

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,403
Yeah,

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,580
you actually did pay them.

18
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:01,920
I thought they just
take it out of your ass

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,400
in spades.

20
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,263
Rude.

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:07,740
Rude.

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,000
You like religions so fun.

23
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,523
No it isn't.

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,190
No he's not.

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,260
We Jews have a decent,

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,520
she would use were way better
sense of you having the Catholics.

27
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,020
Catholics you saw about suffering daddy.

28
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:23,854
They returned.

29
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,310
They returned the radiators on in the
summer and in the winter they would turn

30
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:28,144
them off.

31
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,183
It's like why?

32
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,670
That's a real thing I have
trust might be my happy place.

33
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,290
I may be good

34
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,880
over the water or coffee.

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,020
I like the coconut oil and coffee thing.

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,593
That's good.

37
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,413
It's

38
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,983
good.

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,840
Doesn't regular code got water sharing?

40
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,390
They just went up or not one.

41
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,253
That one right there.

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,410
I think he called you
and shit talking Daddy.

43
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:15,244
Second

44
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,040
lender again.

45
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,873
That's okay.

46
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,703
Hmm.

47
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,843
Okay.

48
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,860
Get him NASA patches.

49
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,100
Ronda Rousey's real Ronda Rousey's
way harder than her patch.

50
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,740
The only female UFC fighter
than one gives a shit about,

51
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,583
cause she's hot.

52
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,020
Janet chronic ulcer right now.

53
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:56,854
She's an actor.

54
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,230
She used to fight.

55
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,960
She'd speak.

56
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,063
Maybe not.

57
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,970
Maybe not this grouping though.

58
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:37,961
Yeah.

59
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:39,600
I just want them all close to,

60
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:41,020
it's easier that way,

61
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,711
but he was saying,

62
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:44,020
I was planning on that one.

63
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,510
That's good to know that the exact
same shot in the matter where he was

64
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,523
nice.

65
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,570
I felt like I was like,

66
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:31,820
oh,

67
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,950
I'll have go to this podcast.

68
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:36,270
I think they thought I meant
like right now this second thing.

69
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,520
Yeah.

70
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,353
People get angry.

71
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,790
They're entitled Matt.

72
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,890
They want all their money.

73
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,530
Do you need to be up to date?

74
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:47,590
There's not enough free content from this

75
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,853
such

76
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,353
light.

77
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,650
Well that's the definitely like it's
going to be online later with the same

78
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:56,951
shot.

79
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:57,251
We were like,

80
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:57,521
wow,

81
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:02,470
I don't like the idea of broadcast
NBC in his country and like

82
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,121
the Ukraine.

83
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:09,900
I don't know that CEO
and you might have nine.

84
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,743
All I need it.

85
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,980
I get angry emails.

86
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,280
Yo marching songs,

87
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,610
shit by yourself.

88
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,840
I'll give you joy.

89
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,480
Fucking shoot.

90
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,060
You should be good to have greatness.

91
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,143
You see,

92
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,910
you used to be some special bro.

93
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,280
You fucking shows sell out.

94
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,013
How's that feel

95
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,360
lashing out.

96
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,370
They will totally do you want the
password are smoking tire county.

97
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:45,131
You can lash out.

98
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:45,964
All you want to

99
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,650
comment as a nominee for the,

100
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,843
obviously

101
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,513
that was nice.

102
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,750
I just took off start.

103
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,910
I would love to do that under account.

104
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,073
Yeah.

105
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,220
Just torching April.

106
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,873
Yeah.

107
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,823
Done.

108
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,810
You know why they got cocky?

109
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,780
No back up.

110
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,510
Think you get a better

111
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,030
recording.

112
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,090
Slip the fucking moment.

113
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,243
Dirty flux.

114
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,360

Including this Friday night we'll be at
the ice house in Pasadena in the little

134
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:09,200
room doing an episode of Thunderpussy,

135
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,080
which is a completely
improvisational podcast.

136
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,880
The audience yells out ideas.

137
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,320
He'd go onstage,

138
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,160
blitzed out of your fucking mind and
you talk mad shit and it's probably the

139
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:20,540
funnest thing I've ever done in my life.

140
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,590
Or you are on a Friday night.

141
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,190
I'm in Philly.

142
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,600
Go Fuck yourself Philly.

143
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,770
How bill burr was,

144
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,530
right.

145
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,363
All right.

146
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,581
Much love.

147
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:32,420
Big Kiss to everybody.

148
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,583
Ooh,

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,833
that was fun.

150
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,780
Anyone else got a back

151
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,093
college?

152
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:46,431
Yeah,

153
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,020
it was fine.

154
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,260
Right?

155
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,020
Was a blast.

156
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,340
I would have a pool table in a heartbeat.

157
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,540
I love having one brush with this one.

158
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,210
This is from the 1970s.

159
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,800
It's a gold crown too.

160
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,103
Scratching

161
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,713
fucker.

162
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,573
And I just,

163
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,373
hello?

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,181
Oh,

165
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:27,980
high ball goes in and you scratch.

166
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:28,814
You don't win

167
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,270
anywhere on the table.

168
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:38,530
Well,

169
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,460
you have is a nightmare.

170
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,800
It's not a victory.

171
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:42,900
You have a one ball that's wide open,

172
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,510
but the two balls tied up with the eight.

173
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,920
You'd have to play to
eight combination then

174
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,560
all have to go off of one more,

175
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,220
right?

176
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:49,680
Yeah.

177
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,170
I mean if you can possibly knock those
balls free once you make the one ball.

178
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,710
Do you see last standing?

179
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,660
The new one?

180
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:56,960
No,

181
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,180
no,

182
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,280
no.

183
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,113
You're good.

184
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,891
I heard it's better,

185
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,150
but because Rosanne's kidding.

186
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,070
Russell Peters is on
the behind the scenes,

187
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,270
but that you breakout
star from that Shimmy.

188
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:08,810
Shimmy Schumer is the answer.

189
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:09,240
Yeah.

190
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,310
We got along well.

191
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:12,920
You know what's his face as the host?

192
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,860
A JB Smoove.

193
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,270
Yeah.

194
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,103
Who's hilarious.

195
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,331
Yeah.

196
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:16,500
He's great move.

197
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,280
I love him.

198
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,660
That guy's funny as shit.

199
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:19,630
I readily wholefoods.

200
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,620
I ran into that dude out of nowhere.

201
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:23,131
It whole foods.

202
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:26,360
He's cool as fuck to ham on
that curb your enthusiasm.

203
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,120
Yeah.

204
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,953
He's a funny guy.

205
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,460
Counts on the fence for
doing Thunderpussy Friday,

206
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:40,690
so if you talk to about us.

207
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,320
Yeah.

208
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,531
Oh,

209
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:42,230
I'll get them in.

210
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,063
Yeah.

211
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,210
Bird crushes your shot.

212
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,220
Sexy bitch getting here.

213
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:50,790
Can we see,

214
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,440
get is dizzy on sitting.

215
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,860
That did have the funniest
fucking story last night.

216
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,410
It's in my pants.

217
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:56,830
Yeah.

218
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,311
Oh yeah,

219
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:58,090
let's go.

220
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:58,330
Yeah.

221
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,890
You see if you can get them yo his number.

222
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,240
He's coming back to live here though.

223
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:02,320
June 1st or something.

224
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:03,460
So it up on the show.

225
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,120
No,

226
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,953
I think they're good.

227
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,380
They're just done for so many.

228
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,750
This chick seasons for a few startups.

229
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,593
He wants to me.

230
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,690
Thanks Joe.

231
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,450
Yeah.

232
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:17,870
Yeah.

233
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,890
Text me his number.

234
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,360
So when they started selling
tickets for Friday night,

235
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,071
was it sold out?

236
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:29,450
Yeah.

237
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:29,830
Uh,

238
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,560
I mean chuck,

239
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,050
they flip it.

240
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,883
Have the opposite.

241
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,770
This blackberry go,

242
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,703
whoa.

243
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,640
This is your shot.

244
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:38,880
And you can't even hit the one ball pit.

245
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,873
Yes.

246
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,480
Yeah.

247
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,313
Make an eight ball.

248
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,170
I fuck's bill.

249
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,060
Good luck.

250
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,893
Can

251
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,630
you want me drunk people
I've talked to her,

252
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:57,740
convinced her good pool.

253
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,120
It's quite fascinating.

254
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,303
You reviewed this job.

255
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,170
I'm telling you right pocket.

256
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,560
It seems like the
universe doesn't love you.

257
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,540
This is interesting.

258
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,020
Play pool as the good person that knows
how to play pool and somebody is able to

259
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:41,854
leave their shots.

260
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,223
Okay,

261
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,793
seriously.

262
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,350
Who?

263
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:54,770
Yeah,

264
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,570
I can do it too.

265
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,440
All ended up there.

266
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,073
No,

267
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,220
we should ask you a question.

268
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,780
Sure.

269
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,350
Did you go for the five ball
that way as opposed to this way?

270
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:10,651
Cause it,

271
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:11,191
but they do do that.

272
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:11,930
I shot,

273
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,650
I have two shots a on site
as possible or fly ball here.

274
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,030
The problem playing the size,

275
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:19,740
but we're gonna have
to hit it lighter have,

276
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,730
but I didn't come back properly
cause I have a bad angle.

277
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,811
I honestly,

278
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,130
if I did want to come back,

279
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,800
I would want to have an angle just about

280
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,930
two inches that way so that I could stay
on this side of the ball because that's

281
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:37,230
what scares me right there.

282
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,801
No,

283
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:38,611
it's not scary.

284
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:39,391
But this side pocket,

285
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:39,810
I couldn't,

286
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,150
I now I'm not going to play.

287
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:42,721
No,

288
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:47,721
I'm playing because of the angle plane
to come down here and then shoot this

289
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:54,150
ball in the side pocket because
the angle's not good though.

290
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:54,984
The Pool,

291
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,700
when you play a certain level,

292
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,610
it's all about um,

293
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,100
maintain the correct angle to
go from one ball to the other.

294
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,083
Ideally,

295
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,930
I would've liked to stop
anywhere around right here.

296
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,471
So funny.

297
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:07,890
I would,

298
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,551
I would have stopped.

299
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:09,630
I wouldn't try to stop here.

300
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,760
There's I one with that shot
as opposed to the natural.

301
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:12,780
That's good too,

302
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:13,950
but I wanted to,

303
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:15,120
once I make the ball,

304
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:19,530
I want to wind up right around
here and we're in town right now.

305
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:23,160
It's very hard to do that because we're
telling right now the natural angle of

306
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:25,500
shooting the ball and it's going
to make the ball go this way,

307
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,850
so now I have to adjust to that and I
have to make the ball go this way and then

308
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:34,851
out here and I have to hit it and I hit
up to here with low right hand English

309
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,490
so that when it hits the table,

310
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,361
it's the rail,

311
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,010
it bounces off and gets good.

312
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,080
The other thing that I
noticed is whenever I break,

313
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,180
I break with Tom English.

314
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,700
I've only broken that way.

315
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:53,450
I've never broken.

316
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,283
You broke,

317
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,760
you broke using the bottom.

318
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,010
It doesn't matter if
you could stop the ball.

319
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,650
I like to use bonding,

320
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,270
but some people do like to
talk as a plow suitable.

321
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,513
When you hear something

322
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,331
said they're good at pool,

323
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:10,750
you're like,

324
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:10,961
oh,

325
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:11,794
but how good are you?

326
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,100
I just hope I don't get left for them.

327
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,460
Easy shot and I can't make that right.

328
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:36,941
Well,

329
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:39,280
it's one of those things
where I find that,

330
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:40,114
like

331
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,770
when we're talking
about like archery play,

332
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,060
that's what Sean did.

333
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:49,791
Well,

334
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,830
people do archery and he got a tech.

335
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,270
You do a bunch.

336
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,953
That was good.

337
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,170
That was good.

338
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,003
Very nice.

339
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,260
I got a couple more.

340
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:00,771
Oh No,

341
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:01,101
I'm good.

342
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:01,934
I'm good.

343
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,680
I can get out of your body
finally that take their
