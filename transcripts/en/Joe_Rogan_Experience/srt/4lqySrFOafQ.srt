1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,523
Freak bitches.
I observed the food day of surgery an 

2
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:10,180
entire day.
Like I saw eight operations when I was a

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,023
freshman in high school.
I had the illusion that I would be a 

4
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,620
doctor,
be a doctor,

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,390
and then my uncle was a doctor.
He sent me up at the,

6
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:21,224
a Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville and so I 
meet this guy and I was pretty big kid 

7
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:26,900
so they're like,
what college do you go to?

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,813
And I was like,
no,

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,240
I'm in school.
And they're like,

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,800
okay,
you ready to see this?

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,663
Like they thought it was a little more 
and the first one we see is a woman who 

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,673
spread eagle.
She's 80 and the removing assist from 

13
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:41,930
her vagina.
And here's the thing,

14
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:42,764
he goes,
so he comes over because he comes over 

15
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:47,510
to me and I'm with my dad and he goes,
hey,

16
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:50,570
don't make any jokes while you're in 
here.

17
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:51,920
And I go,
what are you talking about?

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,210
He goes,
she's awake.

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,020
So if you're like,
oh,

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,853
look at her old plus.

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,250
Okay.
No,

22
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,910
but the best way they go in Gnarly,
they fucking open up.

23
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,260
The cyst is the size of a softball,
so the guy's like,

24
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,850
this is the biggest we've ever seen.
Has the,

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:16,963
has another nurse go get a camera,
starts documentaries like this is going 

26
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:22,340
to be in a journal.
This is incredible.

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,050
Then they rupture it.
Shooting out of there.

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,900
Have you ever seen onto Dr Pimple 
popper.com?

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,710
Oh,
headphones.

30
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,410
Headphones.
Dr.

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,733
Purple Lady on Instagram and I'm 
obsessed with her page and she's got 

32
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:44,580
like millions of followers to because 
she.

33
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,883
All she does is her youtube videos or 
instagram videos or I'll just her 

34
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:53,390
popping cysts.
And it is strangely strangely.

35
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,180
So she cut Dr Sandra Lee.
Hello,

36
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:00,590
Sandra.
Um,

37
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,650
millions of millions of views on 
instagram.

38
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:05,780
Millions of views on youtube.
Oh No,

39
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:06,680
not yet.
Wait,

40
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,690
wait till you see it.
You're not going to bark yet.

41
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,260
So right now she's cutting into this 
woman's back who has what looks like,

42
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,210
like a small frog growing her back.
So she's like cutting the top of it off.

43
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,420
Cutting a chunk of the meeting was 
really good at cutting it yet.

44
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,920
Yeah.
Because she wants to,

45
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:26,090
uh,
remove it in one chunk.

46
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:31,091
Like sometimes she can get them Hawaii.
She's opening it up right now with these

47
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,234
scissors.
This is not the most satisfying because 

48
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:36,140
this right now we're just looking at 
surgery.

49
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,093
You okay?
Steve?

50
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,420
I don't like it.
Why is it just says she's snipping.

51
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,690
Oh,
why you gotta be so nasty,

52
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,543
Joe.
I have seen so many people get cut and 

53
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,710
knocked unconscious and beat up.

54
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,210
I'm not averse to looking at ces.
Now look how nasty this is.

55
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:57,760
Once you start scoring,
and here we go.

56
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,600
Here we go.
Come on,

57
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,521
come on.
Oh,

58
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,100
thank you.
Oh,

59
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,420
there you go.
Oh God,

60
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,610
what a person's body to vomit.
No way back.

61
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,340
Is that a back cyst?
What is that?

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,300
Sorry to tell them.
What is the cyst is just nasty.

63
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,150
Just nasty shit.
I don't know.

64
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,830
What it says is.
That was,

65
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,890
huh?
I think it's dead skin.

66
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:27,730
I read about one of these recently 
because they're always watching.

67
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,990
Well,
why don't you just google it?

68
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,591
I did.
Oh,

69
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,290
I can't.
Oh,

70
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,010
well,
we'll find out.

71
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,010
We did so much speculation.
We did a podcast this weekend without,

72
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,053
without Jamie on the computer and we're 
asking questions and no one ever 

73
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:44,260
answered the questions we just said it 
was like 100 percent misinformation.

74
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,090
I heard.
I heard it was like this.

75
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,560
Do you want to look?
Hey Jamie.

76
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,850
I think we're all good.
That was great.

77
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,700
Thanks.
I'm just going to get to the end of it.

78
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,530
She really,
some of them are fucking unbelievable.

79
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,640
Push them now.
Looks like trash.

80
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,300
Trash in your body yet.
Five minutes left on this video.

81
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,680
I'm going to do a damn thing to me.
You just had a baby.

82
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,660
Should be like durable now with the 
whole.

83
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,750
Yeah.
It's crazy how big that hole is.

84
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,850
Like that's a god damn gaping holes.
The stuff coming out.

85
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:19,963
That's the gnarly parts or why she had 
to do it that obviously I'm not a 

86
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:24,280
doctor,
I'm not criticizing her technique,

87
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,323
but I wonder why you have to take a 
chunk out of the skin and less instead 

88
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,840
of like making like a little hatch.
Like you remember those?

89
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:32,880
Um,
you know,

90
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,710
like old school pajamas,
scape dude.

91
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,950
Yeah.
That's a small fish.

92
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,150
Yeah.
Oh,

93
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,750
for the love of Mommy,
get that last part out,

94
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:44,584
that sack that that it's all holding in 
and then what's left over after I heard 

95
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:51,490
that they don't actually know what 
causes cysts.

96
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,060
How comforting.
I don't know.

97
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,210
Anything.
You just growing up.

98
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,320
Golf ball size,
bag of pus on years from now.

99
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:00,730
We don't know.
And people grow in weird spots too.

100
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,060
They don't even know why.
Yeah,

101
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,093
go weird.
Spots are going to top your head and 

102
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:05,224
shit.
They over grow and they're not 

103
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,820
cancerous.
Find a member.

104
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,790
Woo Membrane the membrane.
This membrane,

105
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,633
the membrane in the body,
a membranous sack or cab cavity of 

106
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:25,330
abnormal character containing fluid.
A tough protective capsule.

107
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,880
And closing the larva.
Parasitic worm.

108
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,530
No.
So yeah,

109
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,393
I guess it's a.
A cavity containing fluid and they used 

110
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:34,990
the word fluid super loosely.

111
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,240
Fluid pus.
It's fluid.

112
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:48,820
It's like a whipped cream,
like pissy nastiness.

113
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,250
That's not good.
Nah,

114
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,120
no blood on your vagina too.
That's.

115
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,000
I imagine this ladies.
I still remember it.

116
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,780
It was on her badge,
on the outer part so everybody could see

117
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:04,970
or inside it was inside,
but then they,

118
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,013
they,
they had her in some way where they 

119
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:08,174
could push back and you could see it 
coming out of the side coming like on 

120
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:15,710
the wall in a speculum,
like they opened her up.

121
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,130
Wow.
That's gnarly.

122
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,130
Wonder if it really had fluid though.
I do remember that.

123
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,290
It wasn't like this.
It really was like a stream coming out.

124
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,930
I hate.
I hate to be disrespectful,

125
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:28,130
but do you think it made her pussy 
tighter?

126
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,060
I think so.
It seems like a wood.

127
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,790
It's a really good question.
Yeah.

128
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,753
I don't see how,
unless you had it in your mouth and be 

129
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:41,240
sure tough to swallow.
So imagine if you got it in your box.

130
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,950
It was.
I think that's how they said snug it up.

131
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,530
David discovered it because her husband 
was tight.

132
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,360
He's like,
Oh shit,

133
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:48,650
baby.
That,

134
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,130
that,
that,

135
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,590
that 85 percent.
