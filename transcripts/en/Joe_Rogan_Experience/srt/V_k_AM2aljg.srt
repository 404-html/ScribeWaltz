00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:19,720
domain name registrations.

easy,
clean interface.

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,170

10
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:36,790

you can hide that shit.

11

They're owned by the same people that 

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,561
own Tang and uh,
there's sort of the same ethic behind 

15
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:56,311
it.
That's they're trying to offer you a 

16
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:58,430
very cool service.
I'm a with a decent price that's not 

17
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,061
ripping anybody off and it's something 
that we all need if we want to set up 

18
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,150
and established websites.
So go there,

19
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,330
check it out.
Um,

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,740
it is a,
what are the other things that have to 

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,080
say about this

22
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,130
and it has a lot of cool,
uh,

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,280
uh,
options that aren't easily found when 

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,280
you buy a domain,
like if you go to the,

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,360
some of the other guys,
you don't get all these extra bonuses 

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,260
that this company does,
like a hiding your personal information,

27
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,030
you know,
the security of that,

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,120
which is nice because you don't want,
you know,

29
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,150
if you buy a domain,
you don't want everyone to know your 

30
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,150
home address.
Yeah,

31
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,150
most of the time usually have to pay for
that stuff.

32
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,150
Yeah.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,040
And again,
it's a,

34
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,030
it's the same company that owns ting.
So,

35
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:38,140
uh,
we support them,

36
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:40,210
they support us and it's,
it's a cool company.

37
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,950
So go there,
hover.com

38
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:46,951
forward slash rogen gave yourself 10 
percent off your domain name 

39
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:49,801
registrations freaks.
We're also brought to you by 

40
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,480
audible.com.
And if you go to audible.com/Joe,

41
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,190
you will get one free audio book and one
free month of audible service.

42
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,230
Auto Bowl is uh,
an excellent service for use of audio 

43
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:04,360
books.
Um,

44
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,730
I became a big fan of audio books many 
years ago.

45
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:11,670
It's one of the best ways to spend time 
where you're forced to sit down and,

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,720
you know,
usually it's wasted time whether you're 

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,530
on a plane or whether you're driving 
somewhere stuck in traffic or on a train

48
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:22,531
or something like that.
Audio books make an amazing companion 

49
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:25,180
and actually make a boring trip.
Enjoyable.

50
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:30,570
I'm Christopher Ryan,
our friend who is on the podcast again 

51
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,110
today,
I believe your book is available.

52
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,810
Um,
sex at dawn is available in audio form.

53
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,210
It was voted one of the best audio books
of 2010 when it came out.

54
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,320
And I actually read the preface,
which is a story of being attacked by a 

55
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,020
monkey who,
uh,

56
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,260
who read the book for you,
who reads the other two actors.

57
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:52,810
There's a female and a male actor who 
read,

58
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,680
uh,
because we,

59
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:56,800
we asked that there be two,
a male and a female voice,

60
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,960
uh,
since it was coauthored with my,

61
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,360
someone's

62
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,770
all into a quality and shit.

63
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

64
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:05,520
It was kind of weird though.
I mean,

65
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:06,120
the,
the.

66
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,340
Why didn't you read it?
While I offer to.

67
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,900
They wouldn't let him in.
They were like,

68
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:10,590
no,
thanks.

69
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,150
Anyway,
sons of bitches.

70
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:14,100
But no thanks.
Um,

71
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,130
yeah,
when you're a first time author you 

72
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:19,130
don't get a lot of respect,
I got to say.

73
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:19,380
And you know,
the second time around,

74
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:21,500
it's a whole different thing if the 
first book sell.

75
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,620
Yeah,
I would imagine.

76
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,450
Yeah.
But first time around you,

77
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,040
they treat you.
In fact,

78
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:29,430
I had a dispute with one of the editors 
and um,

79
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,710
which ended with her crying and hanging 
up on me

80
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,500
and in earlier crying,
there's no crying in publishing

81
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,930
and then she quit.
Yeah,

82
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:40,850
like within A.
Yeah.

83
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,690
I really made her quit.
Well,

84
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:45,240
I don't know that it was me or I was the
last straw,

85
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,290
whatever,
but yeah,

86
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,200
it didn't end well.
But an earlier conversation with her,

87
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:54,201
she was saying something and I said yes,
what they were talking about the cover 

88
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:57,510
art and they had different ideas and I 
was like,

89
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:58,110
well,
you know,

90
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:59,310
the one you sent me,
it's cool,

91
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:04,311
but why don't you send me your other 
ideas and then we can brainstorm 

92
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:04,860
together.
And she was like,

93
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:06,010
um,
uh,

94
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,500
no,
no,

95
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:11,501
we authors can only see one idea.
And I were business partners here.

96
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:12,950
Why can't I,
I'm,

97
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,080
what does that mean?
Well,

98
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:16,860
why can't I be involved in this?
And she said,

99
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:21,861
well,
we can't have the inmates running the 

100
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:21,861
asylum.

101
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,220
Oh Jesus,
you're a prisoner now.

102
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,620
A mental Haas.
And I said,

103
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,940
you know,
I'm a psychologist.

104
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:30,941
My wife actually does run a mental 
hospital or a 32 year old idiot.

105
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:36,830
So this is that.
What made her quit?

106
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:40,250
You call her a 32 year old idiot.
I don't know if I use those words,

107
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,380
but that was my implication.
Might have called her a cunt.

108
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,480
I might have,
might have it comes out sometimes 

109
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,520
there's moments when it's necessary.
I'm a audible.

110
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:50,480
Uh,
other than that,

111
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,910
audible has nothing to do with the 
Christopher Ryan incident.

112
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,420
No,
they were wonderful except for not 

113
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:58,420
letting me read the whole book.
Sons of bitches.

114
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,400
What's wrong with you people?
But the monkey attacks the most 

115
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:03,400
important part.
Yeah.

116
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,240
And you read that.
I did read that they should do a revised

117
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,000
version.
Let you do it because I generally prefer

118
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,180
except Stephen King,
Stephen King is God damn terrible at 

119
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,180
reading his books.

120
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,570
He's so boring.
You know,

121
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:18,040
when you have an author read the Stephen
King books that become exciting.

122
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,260
There's so much drama and but Stephen 
King is so flat.

123
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,230
He's amazing author and one of my 
favorite fiction authors,

124
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,950
authors ever.
But uh,

125
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,690
if you get his audio books,
do not get one that's read by him,

126
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,840
but that's my warning to you.
And then we'd go to audible.com

127
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,870
forward slash Joe.
Get yourself a free audio book and 30 

128
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,530
free days of service.
That's an excellent company.

129
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:41,480
I've been using them for almost a decade
now.

130
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,050
I've been using them for a long time so 
I can stand up for audible.

131
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,760
They're outstanding.
And again,

132
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:49,760
they support this podcast and you 
already know about [inaudible] dot com.

133
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:52,210
We don't have to say that today.
Let's just get to Stanley Kripner.

134
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,250
He's driven,
driven all the way here from San 

135
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,200
Francisco with Dr Christopher Ryan,
and they even did a podcast along

136
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,700
the way.
They don't give a fuck folks.

137
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:02,850
They double dip and making things 
happen.

138
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,720
Cue The music from flip these.
Get these people going.

139
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,030
Joe Rogan podcast.

140
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,510
That was the weirdest one that caught me
off guard.

141
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:24,330
And what happened?
I don't know.

142
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,970
I was waiting for her on it,
I guess.

143
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:26,890
Yeah.
Well we just,

144
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,650
we just rushed through that.
Stanley Kripner.

145
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,510
Thank you very much,
Sir for coming down here.

146
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,130
Pleasure.
And Mr Ryan.

147
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:34,750
Thank you very much for bringing 
Stanley.

148
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,410
When we first did a podcast with Chris,
one of the things he talked about was 

149
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,180
you and he said that you're a dear 
friend and that if,

150
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,020
if it's possible got to get you on the 
podcast.

151
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:50,200
So here I am so proud.
I'm so honored.

152
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,520
I can't believe you actually bothered to
make the trip all the way down from San 

153
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,280
Francisco and do a podcast along the 
way.

154
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,960
How can they,
how can people get that podcast that you

155
00:06:58,961 --> 00:06:59,740
guys did along the way?

156
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,650
Well,
I guess,

157
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:03,640
I guess we'll put it up this week and I,
you know,

158
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:08,641
we've got a bunch in the pipeline but 
we'll just bump everybody else and yet 

159
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:12,880
people can hear us driving down from 
Bakersfield on route five complaining 

160
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:12,880
about the cow shit smell

161
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,300
big part of that trip.
Yeah.

162
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,690
That is a weird drive,
right?

163
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,040
It's a weird drive.
I took that drive before the elections 

164
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,370
and uh,
that's when you realize a California,

165
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:29,371
although California is mainly liberal,
there's these pockets where we have 

166
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:31,260
cities where everybody,
you know,

167
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,270
is fairly literate and educated and then
if you spread out towards where they 

168
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,300
grow things for some reason those folks 
like to believe and nonsense.

169
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,930
And uh,
they had Mitt Romney bumper stickers and

170
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,780
Mitt Romney posters and like,
where am I?

171
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:49,930
Am I in Idaho or something like that.
What's going on here?

172
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:53,290
What do you know who met Romney is?
I want to pull over and go,

173
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,790
what's going on?
What is this?

174
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,500
But you know,
that line about Pennsylvania.

175
00:07:56,501 --> 00:08:00,220
I grew up in Pennsylvania and they say 
there's Philadelphia on one side,

176
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:02,210
Pittsburgh on the other side in Alabama.
And

177
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,730
so true,
my parents,

178
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,120
my parents used to live in Wilkes Barre.
Oh yeah.

179
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:07,680
Yeah.
That's,

180
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:13,060
that's no joke.
That's where people wear camouflage to 

181
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,060
the grocery store.
It's total rush limbaugh country.

182
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,370
Well,
there's so many deer out there and you 

183
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:18,370
never know when you're going to have to 
duck behind a car and shoot.

184
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:18,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

185
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,810
Anyway,
tangentially speaking,

186
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:24,811
that's the name of my podcast.
Anyone wants to check out my extended 

187
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:24,811
conversation with Stanley?
If they had.

188
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,400
I'm sure they won't get enough.
Never enough.

189
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:29,120
Stanley.
That's Stanley.

190
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,140
What was your,
your name that the Shaman gave you,

191
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:33,640
your,
your spirit name?

192
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,490
Well,
rolling thunder gave me the name.

193
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,180
Everybody's favorite.
That's everybody's favorite because 

194
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,250
everybody,
he talked to me,

195
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,230
but a native American who was not a 
shotgun,

196
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,870
um,
who I dedicated this book to add 

197
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,410
Richardson gave me the of Costa Wash 
Day.

198
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,930
And the best way to translate that is to
use a yiddish term mench.

199
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,250
Oh.
So I thought that was a great either 

200
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,951
coming from the first native American 
who got a clinical psychology phd in the

201
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:12,560
country.

202
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,820
Wow.
And that's this gentleman rolling 

203
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,820
thunder.
No,

204
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,000
the other guy who we dedicated the book 
to,

205
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,150
and regrettably as soon as the book came
out,

206
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:28,151
he passed over to the advanced age,
so the book is dedicated to him and his 

207
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,430
memory and our long friendship over the 
years.

208
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,970
Now you are.
I'm one of the few people that is alive 

209
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,721
today.
They can say they did ask him with 

210
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:40,721
Timothy leary.

211
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:40,721
Oh good heavens.
I'm.

212
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:42,030
I'm sure there are more

213
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,080
people because tim leary to the acid 
with a lot of people.

214
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,020
I'm sure there's more,
but the numbers are fairly small.

215
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,050
I would say it's less than one 10th of 
one percent of the population,

216
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,700
but you know how it is.
Small numbers can have magnificent 

217
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,760
effects in chaos theory.
You have about the butterfly wings 

218
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,210
causing the typhoon and Malaysia.
Yeah,

219
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,450
that's what they say,
but that's.

220
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,890
People don't understand.
That's a metaphor.

221
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,220
That's a metaphor.

222
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,880
It's like a lot of stuff in shamanism is
metaphor.

223
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,230
You deal with it at the metaphorical 
level than that.

224
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,040
Make sense?

225
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,600
The whole term shamanism is very tricky,
isn't it?

226
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,180
It's.
You say it amongst the respectable 

227
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,180
company and they go,
oh,

228
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,960
okay.
You know,

229
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:36,961
Shamans and what happens with these 
shamans do you do go to spirit worlds 

230
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,650
and you're like,
well,

231
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:40,600
yes actually,
and then like,

232
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:45,601
okay,
and then immediately the conversation 

233
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:45,601
becomes they're talking to a silly 
person,

234
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:46,110
right?
Which is what I talked to

235
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,670
just I don't even use the word spirit 
world for one thing to be a mom and you 

236
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,171
have to be appointed the Shaman via 
community and if the community doesn't 

237
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:59,840
consider you worthy of being a spiritual
leader,

238
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,200
then you don't pass the test and instead
of saying we go to a spirit world,

239
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:06,410
I say,
well,

240
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:11,411
Sharma's get knowledge and information 
in ways that other members of their 

241
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:15,440
community camp and I just leave it up to
that.

242
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:15,980
They say,
well,

243
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:16,780
what ways?
Well,

244
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,820
they get information from their dreams.
They get information by observing 

245
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,880
plants,
observing people.

246
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,120
They have a very,
very keen sense of observation and 

247
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,720
insight and then that starts to make 
sense to them.

248
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,560
Oh,
you mean like a Sarah Apis?

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well,
Shamans were the first therapists 

250
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,970
because they mediated problems between 
couples.

251
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,480
They did a lot to keep the community 
together.

252
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,810
They help people to get better.
If they were sick or if they were 

253
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,381
feeling poorly and so they were also the
first physicians of the first doctors 

254
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,950
and they used herbs for reason or 
another seem to work,

255
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,190
so taking it down to a very practical 
level,

256
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,940
you can talk about shamanism and give 
them the due respect,

257
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:03,350
the life that they deserve,

258
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,110
but as a psychologist there's and that's
what you are,

259
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,640
not that many people in that realm of 
professional business who accept those 

260
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:16,770
terms.
They use the term Shaman and it's.

261
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,150
That's where it gets tricky,
right?

262
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:23,151
It gets tricky in that it's almost like 
you need a professional word to you 

263
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:27,741
know,
to to replace it with that people are 

264
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:27,741
going to accept in,
in,

265
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:27,840
in the mainstream.

266
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,380
Actually the word Shaman Commerce from 
the field of anthropology and the word 

267
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:39,631
Shaman originated in Siberia.
Nobody knows just win because there were

268
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:42,330
three different tribes in Siberia that 
used words,

269
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:44,160
some of the Shaman,
but they'll.

270
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:49,190
Anthropologists began to notice that 
spiritual practitioners and other 

271
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:52,930
indigenous societies did pretty much the
same things.

272
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,510
They helped people.
They healed people.

273
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,610
They use their imagination.
They did rituals,

274
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,730
they told myths and narratives,
and so these other people who had their 

275
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:12,661
own words for shaman all got lumped 
together by anthropologists using the 

276
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:17,911
term Shaman,
so we're sort of stuck with it and all 

277
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:22,291
that I can say is don't take it that 
seriously because each tribe that you 

278
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,730
visit has its own word rolling thunder.
For example,

279
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:29,731
the subject of our book,
the Voice of Rolling Thunder never 

280
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:32,761
called himself a shaman.
He called himself an inter tribal 

281
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:36,451
medicine man because he was able to 
learn the medicine systems of five or 

282
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:42,421
six different native American tribes.
He had a whole trailer full of herbs,

283
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:48,571
hundreds of herbs that I saw them 
firsthand and he would take the herbs 

284
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:53,410
that would be most suitable for whoever 
he was helping out as he put it,

285
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:58,411
whoever he was doctoring,
and then of course he did a little 

286
00:13:58,411 --> 00:13:58,480
ritual that went along with it.

287
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,130
Now how much of the herbs that he gave 
people were actually effective and how 

288
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,130
much of it was a placebo.

289
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,250
You know,
this is one of the important ways in 

290
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,151
which shamans contributed to the 
evolution of the human species.

291
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,990
Obviously some of the herbs were 
additional,

292
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:22,270
obviously some of them were not,
but they work anyway because of the 

293
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,871
placebo effect,
but imagine a sick person coming to a 

294
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:27,830
shaman,
the shaman and giving them herbs,

295
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,980
doing a ritual waving or a feather 
rattling or rattle banging a drum and 

296
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:37,610
the person for one reason or other gets 
well.

297
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,310
Now what about the people that don't get
well?

298
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,130
Those are people that don't have the 
imagination,

299
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:47,630
they don't have the response to the 
placebo effect,

300
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,700
and so they die.
What happens when they die?

301
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:52,010
Their drop out of

302
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,200
the gene pool?
Who is left?

303
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,290
The people who are left,
the people who are able to access their 

304
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,560
inner healing ability and passed down 
those genes to their descendants and 

305
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:07,300
that's why today we have hypnosis.
We have biofeedback,

306
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,700
we have visual imagery and all of the 
other products of mind,

307
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:14,030
body medicine that work.

308
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,510
The placebo effect highlights a really 
fascinating aspect of the human animal.

309
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,540
This,
this ability to heal itself by being 

310
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,091
tricked or tricking itself into 
believing that it's taking medicine and 

311
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:29,560
then forcing some sort of an effect.
It's very.

312
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,710
It's a very strange and slippery term or
slippery ability and it seems so strange

313
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:41,260
that the ability to be tricked would be 
of evolutionary advantage.

314
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,380
The ability to trick yourself into 
thinking you're taking medicine and 

315
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,110
healing yourself.
We can't really do that consciously.

316
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,710
We couldn't do it consciously,
but let's go back to evolution.

317
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,490
Rolling Thunder often use the term.
Sometimes you have to trick a person 

318
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,361
that they are getting well.
You have to trick a person into using 

319
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:03,721
their own self healing capacity,
their own inner shaman as he put it out.

320
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:09,690
Now you can use that deliberately.
We have people who are able to hypnotize

321
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:16,230
themselves,
who are able to get visual images of 

322
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,161
their bodies,
mending the bones together and getting 

323
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:23,260
well of the cancer cells shrinking.
This doesn't work for everybody,

324
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,530
but visual imagery as a part of a 
holistic program were mainstream 

325
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:33,640
medicine is also used,
can give that extra little edge that can

326
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:38,641
help a person to get well out.
That little extra edge is a linear 

327
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:42,610
descendant of what Charmin's did some 
50,000

328
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:43,180
years ago.

329
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,190
It's,
uh,

330
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,090
it's interesting the,
the placebo effect in that it,

331
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,760
it,
it's a scientific term,

332
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,420
but yet it's not a very scientific 
action.

333
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,510
The action is really sort of mystical in
the ability to heal with the mind and 

334
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,000
using the imagination.
It's a very,

335
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:08,001
very strange thing and it's very strange
and connected with Sherman hasn't begun 

336
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:13,161
shamanism itself.
The idea that these plants contain 

337
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:15,210
information and that especially like 
Iowasca,

338
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:20,211
it's my favorite shamanistic brew just 
because of the fact that they had to 

339
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:25,221
figure out over these hundreds of 
thousands of different plants in the 

340
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:28,881
Amazon which one contained dmt and which
one contained an Mao inhibitor and 

341
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:32,970
combined the two of them,
if you don't know what that means,

342
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:34,410
folks,
the DMT,

343
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:37,370
which is the most potent psychedelic 
drug known to man it,

344
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,140
it exists in a bunch of different forms 
in nature,

345
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,000
but it's not orally active.

346
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,340
The reason why,
um,

347
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,930
you know,
you could eat grass and you don't get,

348
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,590
you don't have a dmt trip is because 
your body produces something called 

349
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,010
Monell,
amy and oxidase and monoamine oxidase,

350
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,370
you can inhibit that and you can inhibit
it with natural plants.

351
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Well,
somehow or another in the course of who 

352
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,040
went,
who knows how many thousands of years 

353
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,100
the Amazon Shaman have had figured out 
how to take the vine of one plant in the

354
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:13,641
leaves of another plant and combine them
together and it was dmt and a natural 

355
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:17,760
Mao inhibitor and that's what.
That's what created Iowasca,

356
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:20,070
which is an orally active version of 
DMT,

357
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:24,390
the only orally active version that 
we're we're aware of and they did it.

358
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,390
They say by talking to the plants and 
the plants told them,

359
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,270
yes,
this is discussed in another recent book

360
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:36,271
of mine,
be mystifying shamanism where we take 

361
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,690
all these mysteries of shamanism.
This is a book by Adam Rock and myself,

362
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,200
and we demystify them and cook them into
a psychological terms.

363
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,510
Now what you say about Iowasca is 
absolutely correct,

364
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:53,710
and I've been to the Amazon.
I've taken Iowasca in Brazil,

365
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,560
and that's very powerful.
That's very valuable.

366
00:18:56,561 --> 00:19:01,561
That's a very good teaching tool to the 
people down there and even the people 

367
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:04,540
from Western cultures.
And the question comes up,

368
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,930
as you said,
of all of the thousands of plants in the

369
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:12,931
rain forest,
how did Shamans know how to put these 

370
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:15,790
two plants together?
And I've asked them about that.

371
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,390
They say,
well,

372
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:19,930
the plant's taught us.
That's good enough for them.

373
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,250
I think that it was a little more 
complicated than that.

374
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,760
I think that they watched animals take 
plants and as the animals began to turn 

375
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,860
on and show unusual behavior,
the shamans began to do that themselves.

376
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,180
Now this doesn't really account for the 
combination of the plants,

377
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:48,181
but maybe they were able to use trial 
and effect besides being the first 

378
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,340
doctors.
The first psychotherapist Shamans were 

379
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,771
the first scientists they used to trial 
and the fact they tried out substances 

380
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:58,540
on themselves.
If they worked on themselves,

381
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,720
they turn to other people.
But the genesis of Iowasca is sort of 

382
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:08,950
lost in the mists of prehistory.
And it's a fascinating topic.

383
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,040
And everything that you say about the 
Moa inhibitor isn't the DMT is 

384
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,040
absolutely correct.

385
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:19,170
It really is a fascinating topic and 
it's such a fragile piece of history 

386
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:23,920
because the shamans are the ones who 
understand and know how to make the brew

387
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,160
and they pass this information down from
generation to generation and if they're 

388
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,991
gone,
if they're lost and we're losing rain 

389
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:33,991
forest by,
you know,

390
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:38,190
by the acre,
like literally as we're talking acres 

391
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,210
are being dissolved and slowly but 
surely these people are getting pushed 

392
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,740
out of their natural home and we're 
losing the lungs of the earth.

393
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:47,080
Literally the rain forests are the 
lungs,

394
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,040
the earth.
I mean that's

395
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,040
where most of our oxygen comes from and 
it's such a fragile thing that we,

396
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:59,430
we,
we know so little about its origins and 

397
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,990
its right there and it's just these few 
people that are,

398
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:07,010
that are living there that,
that truly understand that their 

399
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,260
traditions and they've had them passed 
down generation to generation.

400
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,320
You used the very same terms at me.
Hell Gorbachev used when I talked with 

401
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,870
him.
I wanted him to give me some advice that

402
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:21,871
I could pass onto an ecology conference.
I was going into Brazil to speak at and 

403
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:27,391
he said,
tell the Brazilians that the lungs of 

404
00:21:27,391 --> 00:21:30,601
the earth are the Siberian tiger and the
Amazon rain forest and that the Amazon 

405
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:35,020
rain forest just destroyed one of the 
lungs will be destroyed.

406
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Wow.
Now there are Brazilian laws protecting 

407
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,100
the rain forest,
but you know,

408
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:47,130
the Brazilian army,
the Brazilian police can't protect all 

409
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,821
of the rain forest and a lot of the 
ranchers and lumber companies are just 

410
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:57,100
coming in and slicing up that rain 
forest.

411
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:02,190
Right and left.
I was in southern Brazil with the 

412
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Guarani tribe and the Guarani Sharman 
invited me to a very sacred ceremony and

413
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,970
that ceremony,
he passed around some brew that I drank 

414
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,121
from some stuff that I smoked and other 
people also and after around of shall we

415
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:26,221
say six gourds or pipes of psychoactive 
substances.

416
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:32,670
I was waiting for visions,
but they never arrived and said I could 

417
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:36,151
think very,
very clearly and then he wanted me to 

418
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:39,301
give a prayer and it my best Portuguese,
which I couldn't have done ordinarily.

419
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,230
I said,
yes.

420
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,150
Tell your young people to stop hanging 
themselves from the trees because it was

421
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:49,440
an epidemic of suicide to protest the 
destruction of the rain forest.

422
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,590
Wow.
I said,

423
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:55,591
you met.
Get the young people to be active and 

424
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:56,430
fight the people who are destroying the 
rainforest.

425
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,660
Go into politics,
become lawyers.

426
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,100
Fight this to save the rain forest.
And he said,

427
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,880
how did you know our young people were 
hanging themselves from the trees?

428
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:07,420
I says,
well,

429
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:12,421
I'm a member of the rainforest action 
network and San Francisco and we keep 

430
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:13,750
track of what's happening to the rain 
forest.

431
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:18,751
It's very important for us.
It's important for the world in Shamans 

432
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:22,540
like you are way ahead of the game 
because you know what will happen if the

433
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:23,860
rain forests are destroyed.

434
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,970
It's a very.
It's a very fascinating idea that 

435
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,511
there's an intelligence to plants and 
that these rain forests are networks of 

436
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:36,850
intelligence.
Just that we can't quite tap into it and

437
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:41,851
that somehow or another during these 
altered states you can and then that's 

438
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:43,270
where the information comes to the 
Shaman.

439
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,190
Well,
native from both

440
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,330
north and South America use the term in 
one language or another.

441
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:55,331
All our relations and all of our 
relations are not wholly human beings,

442
00:23:55,431 --> 00:24:00,431
but the creatures who walk on four legs,
the creatures who crawl on their 

443
00:24:00,431 --> 00:24:02,420
bellies,
the creatures who swim in the seas,

444
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,660
the creatures who put their roots into 
the ground or who stand tall in the 

445
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,860
forest,
all of these are relations.

446
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:13,610
This is the web of life.
This is the ecosystem,

447
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,910
and you start to destroy that ecosystem 
and human beings are not far along the 

448
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:22,100
way in terms of being destroyed 
themselves.

449
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,000
Is it a weird

450
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,380
thing that we can't recognize that while
we're doing it,

451
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,500
the human race for some reason is doing 
that and can understand what it's doing 

452
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:30,500
to itself.

453
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,090
Doesn't that come back?
So at the end of it,

454
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,340
doesn't that come back to what you were 
saying earlier about the placebo effect 

455
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,900
and the no cbo effect,
which you know,

456
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,360
a tricking ourselves,
right?

457
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,260
We're tricking ourselves not to notice 
that we're tricking ourselves every damn

458
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:49,261
day.
We're telling ourselves will never die 

459
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:52,111
and so on and so forth.
So and so loves me when you know damn 

460
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:55,231
well she doesn't or whatever it is,
we trick ourselves to make life 

461
00:24:55,231 --> 00:24:55,231
tolerable.
Right?

462
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,090
Right.
So within that context,

463
00:24:58,091 --> 00:25:01,360
tricking yourself to heal yourself seems
like it makes perfect sense.

464
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,990
It really does.
It just,

465
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,010
it's,
it's weird that we're able to do.

466
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:11,300
It's like when you're driving car and 
your car is a broken pipe and you see 

467
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,790
black smoke come out like that.
I got to get to work and not really 

468
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:14,790
thinking about it.
We,

469
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,940
we,
we somehow or another,

470
00:25:15,941 --> 00:25:19,960
don't feel the impact of the horrible 
things that we do in psychology.

471
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,960
We call this denial and people deny 
what's right there in front of them 

472
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,300
because they have other agendas and 
other preoccupations.

473
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,690
This is one reason I was so interested 
in rolling thunder and why we wrote the 

474
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,300
Book Rolling Thunder,
the Voice of rolling thunder because he 

475
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,050
saw all of this 30 years ago.
He saw the global warming.

476
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:43,270
He saw the destruction of the rain 
forest.

477
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:47,080
She saw the pollution of the earth and 
who listened to him.

478
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:50,540
His audiences listen to them,
that politicians listen to them.

479
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:54,250
No,
our politicians listing to him now go to

480
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:59,110
some of the debates in Congress and they
say that global warming is junk science.

481
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:04,650
Here's massive denial from people who 
could make a difference and you take the

482
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:09,760
polls of what the main concerns are of 
the American people.

483
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,990
Concern for the environment is now 
number five or six down the list.

484
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,170
Yeah,
that's a weird thing,

485
00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:21,171
isn't it?
Concern for the actual environment is 

486
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:24,141
not at the top of the list of poisoning 
of our own earth is not at the top of 

487
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:29,181
the list and could be avoided.
We're human beings are so in ingenuity,

488
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,320
ingenious,
and we have such amazing abilities to 

489
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,530
figure out new methods to extract energy
from things.

490
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,920
The fact that we're still relying on 
fossil fuels and we're still burning 

491
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,940
things and pumping smoke into the air.
Although it does make the best sounding 

492
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,321
engines,
it's tough to argue with that at those 

493
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:51,321
goddamn hybrids.
Boy,

494
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,220
anything sucking the soul away from 
America.

495
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:54,180
Sarah,
it's a prius.

496
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,030
Toyota Prius is especially ones with 
bumper stickers.

497
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:58,650
Something about them makes them extra 
annoying.

498
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,730
Isn't the plural pre I should be.
They should be illegal,

499
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,820
you know,
you mentioned to all our relations a 

500
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,310
cocoa in the,
uh,

501
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,670
in the,
the hardback have sex at dawn.

502
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,250
The first,
what's it called at the beginning,

503
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,630
the preface and know that is an epic.
Ram is like,

504
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,820
to my mother and father,
the dedication,

505
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:22,080
right?
We dedicated,

506
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:26,240
it said to all our relations.
I was thinking of this North American,

507
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,280
South American Indian thing,
but a lot of people thought it was 

508
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,280
referring to like,
you know,

509
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,180
group sex or something.
All our lovers or something.

510
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,620
Right,
right,

511
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,270
right.
Changed it in the,

512
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:38,460
in the favor back.
Oh,

513
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:40,290
that's too bad.
She'd leave that in there.

514
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,060
That's actually cool.
It's a cool thing to say.

515
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:42,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

516
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:48,130
You see,
this takes us back to the very first 

517
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:48,130
question you asked.
You think of sharp and Lucy.

518
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,450
Me think of mystical stuff of talking to
spirits.

519
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,040
Know Shamans are very down to earth.
They are concerned with the here and the

520
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,590
now.
There are concerned with the future.

521
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,450
They talk about five,
six,

522
00:27:59,451 --> 00:28:03,290
seven generations in the future.
What is gonna Happen to the Earth in the

523
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:04,700
future?
There are very,

524
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:06,020
very practical people.

525
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,520
Now you've done research on dream 
telepathy and you've,

526
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:15,940
uh,
you've actually been cited in scientific

527
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:19,900
journals and you've been on tv talking 
about this stuff,

528
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:24,310
including the tonight show with Johnny 
Carson was at back in the seventies,

529
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,580
back in the day,
the heyday of Johnny Carson.

530
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,330
Did you have a cocktail?
They have cocktails.

531
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,310
Did they smoke cigarettes?
They smoke cigarettes,

532
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,360
right on Johnny Carson show.
Did they smoke cigarettes on the set?

533
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,400
Not when I was there,
no.

534
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,690
Oh,
Johnny didn't smoke.

535
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:42,910
I thought Johnny was constantly puffing 
away.

536
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:47,320
Yeah.
Know what happened.

537
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,060
I was just doing attorney carson sound.
Oh,

538
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:53,620
that's Ed.
That's Ed Mcmahon.

539
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:59,080
Johnny Carson show 'em.
What is dream telepathy?

540
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:05,170
Well,
this actually goes back to shamanism 

541
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,980
because shamans felt that they could 
communicate with other Shabas who were 

542
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,020
kilometers away,
miles away,

543
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,730
through mental focusing and through 
imagination,

544
00:29:16,731 --> 00:29:18,260
through imagery.
Now,

545
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:21,440
this tradition has come to us through 
time and science,

546
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:23,390
by and large,
didn't take it seriously,

547
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:28,930
but a small group of scientists called 
Paris psychologists devise methods to 

548
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:34,181
put this to a scientific test.
Now to look into dream telepathy,

549
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,900
what we did was to take a soundproof 
room,

550
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,220
could a dreamer and the soundproof room 
electrodes

551
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,220
to the dreamers head.
Look at the electroencephalograph 

552
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,150
machine in those little icicle back and 
forth,

553
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,330
rapid eye movements.
We'd wake up the person and asked them 

554
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,990
what they were dreaming.
Now at the very same time,

555
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,610
there was one of our staff members and 
the distant building and slash,

556
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:03,730
or a distant room who is looking at a 
picture,

557
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:07,090
usually a famous art print,
some of them by several door valley.

558
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:12,091
By the way out.
The staff member was trying to project 

559
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:17,491
that image to the dreamer.
The dreamer is trying to reach out and 

560
00:30:17,491 --> 00:30:21,610
see that picture and none of them would 
transcribe the dreams and then we'd have

561
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:25,780
a team of dream experts try to match the
dreams with the picture.

562
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,080
After nine or 10 or 11 or 12 sessions 
had taken place.

563
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,860
And then you can use statistics to find 
out if the matches happen more often by 

564
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,330
chance.

565
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:42,070
Then they would ordinarily.
And much to our surprise,

566
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:47,490
most of the times they did.
And we did about a dozen different 

567
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,360
series.
And about nine of these series,

568
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:54,361
we're above chance levels,
so we can't say that we have 

569
00:30:54,361 --> 00:30:57,310
demonstrated dream telepathy because 
sometimes it works,

570
00:30:57,311 --> 00:31:01,390
sometimes it doesn't.
All we can say is that we've made a case

571
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:06,391
for dream telepathy,
but I think the most important thing we 

572
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:09,781
did was to take green telepathy off the 
list of symptoms of mental illness back 

573
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:16,621
when we first started out,
if people said that they dreamed about 

574
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:19,981
the future,
dreamed about what a friend was doing 

575
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:21,310
that got a check mark,
that's a sign of schizophrenia.

576
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:24,850
That's a sign of delusional thinking no 
more.

577
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,760
You take a look at the psychiatric 
indices.

578
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:32,230
That's pretty far down the list.
So I think we made a signal contribution

579
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,250
in terms of letting the 
psychotherapeutic world,

580
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:41,251
especially the psychiatric world,
know that one can make a case that 

581
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:46,630
sometimes dream telepathy does indeed 
occur and that the Shamans,

582
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:48,820
once again,
we were ahead of their time because they

583
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:51,910
did this as part of their regular 
practice thousands of years ago.

584
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:57,370
The original,
when when people are with the Western 

585
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,420
world originally started studying 
Iowasca,

586
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:04,510
one of the things that they wanted to do
was call harming before they had 

587
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,411
isolated that it was harming.
They wanted to call it telepathy and 

588
00:32:08,411 --> 00:32:08,411
that was the.
That's the name.

589
00:32:08,411 --> 00:32:12,131
They came to it because it gave these 
group sort of telepathic.

590
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:18,510
It gave some sort of an effect that 
people were able to communicate in 

591
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:18,800
groups.

592
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,070
Well,
my old friend Alan Ginsburg,

593
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,790
as you know,
was the coauthor of the Ya hey,

594
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:29,470
papers y'all hate is another word for a 
whole Osca.

595
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,690
He and William burroughs wrote these 
wonderful letters back and forth and 

596
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:39,221
they experienced telepathy and alums.
Ginsburg went around trying to persuade 

597
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,610
her a psychologist,

598
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:45,850
you know,
use the South American urban your 

599
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,130
experiments.
I took him seriously,

600
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:51,131
but I didn't have a way together.
Nobody else took him seriously and that 

601
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:55,610
experiments still remains to be done.
Now the Iowasca is available now that it

602
00:32:55,611 --> 00:33:00,611
is being used in some experiments or 
another one could see if it lives up to 

603
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,960
its nickname.
Telepathic.

604
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,700
Yeah,
it's a.

605
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,710
it's fascinating that it was already the
scientific nomenclature was already home

606
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:13,980
harming for it because it stuck with 
telepathy and that was like the actual 

607
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,300
scientific word that we use today.
That would be a.

608
00:33:16,301 --> 00:33:21,301
that's a real tricky sort of a slippery 
slope of a scientific name for something

609
00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:25,870
that impart some sort of mystical 
properties.

610
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,940
Well that's true,
and of course to be properly scientific 

611
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,320
one often weeds.
These terms out that are a little too 

612
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,791
esoteric or a little bit off the off the
cliff and so we use words like harmony 

613
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:48,090
and harmony into describe dmt to 
describe these active ingredients.

614
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:53,510
It's interesting to think about all the 
different names for what we now call 

615
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,000
hallucinogenic drugs.
You know,

616
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:59,001
they were psychotic mimetics there for 
awhile and then psychedelics and what 

617
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:03,380
were some of the other three or four?
Actually always liked the word 

618
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,070
fantastic.
Hans never caught on,

619
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:08,370
but the yellow,
they induced fantasy and theologians and

620
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:09,340
the agenda.
Well No,

621
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,540
I'm theo.
John doesn't work because him,

622
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,420
Theo,
Janice,

623
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:17,430
finding the God within and a lot of 
psychedelics do help people find the God

624
00:34:17,941 --> 00:34:22,941
with them,
but some people take psychedelics for 

625
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:24,480
other purposes,
to have fun,

626
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:28,710
to enhance sex,
to explore a nature,

627
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,550
don't lose things,
bring the God within out as well.

628
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,610
In my opinion,
they do.

629
00:34:33,611 --> 00:34:34,870
I wouldn't argue with that.

630
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,010
Yeah,
sure.

631
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,980
The,
the idea of dream telepathy in in 

632
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,320
mainstream science,
it's got to be something that's very 

633
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,320
heavily resisted.

634
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,920
Well,
it is resisted,

635
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:54,010
but I think that as the years go by,
we're getting a much more intelligence 

636
00:34:57,141 --> 00:35:02,141
discussion.
One of my books is called debating 

637
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,980
psychic experiences and we have some of 
the top pair of psychologists debating 

638
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:11,891
some of the top skeptics in a very 
civilized intellectual way back and 

639
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:14,510
forth.
We give the same number of pages to both

640
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:19,511
the advocates and the counter advocates 
and this is a level of discourse that 

641
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,830
never would have happened,
but he years ago,

642
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:27,220
the ultra skeptics never would have sat 
down to help write a book with the 

643
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,500
proponents of dream telepathy and other 
such things.

644
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,920
So at least the discourse is now a 
little more civil and the possibility is

645
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:41,111
now being taken little more seriously.
I don't know what the final outcome is 

646
00:35:41,111 --> 00:35:44,460
going to be because I'm an agnostic on a
lot of these issues,

647
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:49,790
but you know,
I think that this is a human experience 

648
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:53,990
that needs to be explored.
So let's explore it with as many tools 

649
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,100
at our disposal as possible.

650
00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:01,330
So do you believe that dream telepathy 
is something that occurs occasionally 

651
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:05,710
but cannot be.
It can't be reliably reproduced.

652
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:11,450
I wish it could be reliably reproduced 
because it could be put to practical use

653
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:12,180
then.
But no.

654
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:17,181
My belief is it is very unpredictable.
Many things in life are unpredictable.

655
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:23,030
I sort of compare it to when people my 
age have an erection during sex that's 

656
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:28,980
unpredictable.
I wish I could predict it well.

657
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,040
A lot of important things in life,
like erections for older people like 

658
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:37,590
dream telepathy,
like seeing into the future happen,

659
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:42,591
but they're unpredictable.
That doesn't mean we shouldn't explore 

660
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:42,591
them and study them.

661
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:45,700
What do you believe are the components 
of dream telepathy?

662
00:36:45,701 --> 00:36:50,701
Have you isolated it down to a certain 
firing in the synopsis?

663
00:36:50,831 --> 00:36:53,440
Do you mean do you have any idea of what
causes it?

664
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,440
We have the equipment to do much more 
with the brain now than we could.

665
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,100
You have to remember the Paris 
psychologists don't have very much money

666
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:05,620
and don't have the tools to a,
uh,

667
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:10,830
to utilize a lot of this equipment.
But what we did on our studies was very,

668
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:17,571
very simple.
The nights that the dream telepathy 

669
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:20,481
seemed to be successful were the nights 
that the geo magnetic fields of the 

670
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,280
earth were very calm,
very few sunspots,

671
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,300
very few electrical storms,
and so one could hypothesize that there 

672
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:34,821
is a field of some sort of global field 
were these barely detectable influences 

673
00:37:37,361 --> 00:37:40,300
and very subtle means of communication 
that can sneak through.

674
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,130
Also,
by and large,

675
00:37:42,131 --> 00:37:47,131
if there is an emotional connection 
between the people who are in contact 

676
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:52,081
with each other over a distance,
it's more likely to happen than if 

677
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:52,081
they're complete strangers.

678
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,740
Didn't you have some sort of a crazy 
psychic vision of Kennedy being 

679
00:37:58,951 --> 00:37:59,790
assassinated?

680
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,480
Well,
actually idea the alphas drain.

681
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:08,481
My very first psilocybin experience that
I had the courtesy of Timothy leary

682
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:10,820
who

683
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,900
I went to Harvard to visit and who 
invited me to an experiment with 

684
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:21,941
psilocybin.
It was a beautiful and glorious 

685
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:24,701
experience.
It was done during the days when 

686
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:28,570
psilocybin was legal and factors,
one of his last legal psilocybin 

687
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,381
sessions and there was only one Downer 
during that experience and that was when

688
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:35,980
I had the actual

689
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,460
vision during psilocybin with my eyes 
closed of President Lincoln being shot 

690
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,520
and I saw the gun at the base of his 
profile and somebody screamed out,

691
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:53,641
the president has been shot and then 
Lincoln space morphed into that of 

692
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:58,111
Kennedy and there was the rifle except 
now it was not a pistol,

693
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,140
a rifle and somebody who's screaming.
The president has been shot.

694
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,520
I recorded all of that.
I had such an incredible experience.

695
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:11,521
I made dozens of copies and sent it to 
my close friends and of course in 

696
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,520
several months the tragedy of Kennedy's 
death actually happened and so my 

697
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:23,221
vision,
whether it was coincidental or 

698
00:39:23,221 --> 00:39:25,440
pre-cognitive,
was on record and I considered myself a 

699
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,440
highly psychic person.

700
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,990
You don't consider yourself know 
exactly.

701
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,270
Did that freak you out at all?

702
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,950
No,
nothing freaks me out in this field.

703
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:37,951
It's just a surprise that sometimes 
leaves me as a sense of longer because 

704
00:39:37,951 --> 00:39:40,000
there's more things going on in the 
world that we,

705
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,460
uh,
don't take seriously or that take us by 

706
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:45,460
surprise.
But,

707
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,500
um,
the thing that really freaks me out is 

708
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,030
when people do not take global warming 
seriously,

709
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:57,180
the thing that freaks me out as well,
mainstream religions in the world don't 

710
00:39:57,281 --> 00:40:00,630
give women proper rights to control 
their own bodies.

711
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,080
The thing that freaks me out is when 
politicians fight each other,

712
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:10,081
leaving the children of the world,
especially in the Middle East with 

713
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:10,720
nightmares and posttraumatic stress 
disorder.

714
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,570
Those are practical things that I've 
written about.

715
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:15,310
And those are the things that freaked me
out.

716
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:21,210
Yeah,
I think that freaks out anybody with a 

717
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:21,210
conscience or anyone.
He's paying attention to the,

718
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,250
the evils of this world.
We live.

719
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,510
We live in very strange times where we 
have so much information,

720
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,180
more access to information than any 
generation ever,

721
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:33,210
but yet things more or less are still 
going along the same course as far as 

722
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:34,920
global events as far as,
uh,

723
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,030
the monopolization of natural resources 
as far as you know,

724
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,790
using the bore to monopolize those 
natural resources.

725
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,070
It seems to be the same as it's ever 
been.

726
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,880
It's a little better.
Back when I first became interested in 

727
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,841
posttraumatic stress disorder,
I've written three books on that topic 

728
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:56,230
that your listeners can find on Amazon 
calm.

729
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,770
There were 30 wars going on in the 
world,

730
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,580
most of them civil wars.
Now there's 20 wars.

731
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,540
That's an improvement.
Yeah,

732
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:11,550
I guess there are still are a couple of 
billion people who are displaced in the 

733
00:41:12,131 --> 00:41:17,131
refugee camps.
There still are children who have 

734
00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:20,161
nightmares every night because they're 
living in war zones or still are women 

735
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:22,270
being raped and brutalized,
but things are a little better than they

736
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,260
were 30 years ago.

737
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:28,850
Well,
things are a little better than there 

738
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:28,850
were thousands of years ago,
that's for sure.

739
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:32,160
I've had this conversation recently 
where a friend were talking about how 

740
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
thousands of years ago,
if some people up from

741
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,160
another land,
like they were there to rape and 

742
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,160
pillage.
Now when people show up,

743
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,210
they're a part of the global economy.
They're tourists and you know,

744
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:44,210
we allow them in even if they don't 
speak the language and we sell books,

745
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,670
tell,
tell them where the restaurants are,

746
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,590
try to speak English to them to get 
their money.

747
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,900
You know,
the world has changed drastically in 

748
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:53,900
that respect,
but yet,

749
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,060
you know,
there's still a lot of really fucked up 

750
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,450
things about the way human beings 
behave.

751
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:04,770
Well,
that was my friend Buckminster Fuller's 

752
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,920
concept of the global village and 
Buckminster Fuller had a plan,

753
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,980
a logistical plan to feed everybody in 
the world.

754
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:16,990
If the wars would stop.
Now that vision is still applicable,

755
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:22,020
but it's not going to happen as long as 
these 20 wars are going on and food is 

756
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:26,560
unable to go from areas of plenty to 
areas of poverty.

757
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:32,490
So the conflicts and the wars,
not only in the middle of the east but 

758
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,331
in Africa and even in our own country in
terms of the,

759
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:41,320
in terms of the terrorists,
the home bread,

760
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:46,321
terrorists who are victimizing people in
the United States as long as others 

761
00:42:46,321 --> 00:42:48,130
going on,
we still aren't going to have the global

762
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,290
village that Buckminster Fuller digital.

763
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:55,660
Yeah.
The Utopian concept is a really 

764
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:55,660
interesting one.
The idea of the global village,

765
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,890
I've always felt like one way to make it
happen would be to take these people 

766
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:03,870
that are profiting off of rebuilding 
these countries after we blow them up in

767
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,430
like and make it profitable to rebuild 
ghettos,

768
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,820
make it profitable to go to companies 
and educate kids,

769
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:15,821
make it profitable to,
to fix their water systems and provide 

770
00:43:15,821 --> 00:43:19,130
them with sewage and you know,
and make sure that they can take care of

771
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:20,340
themselves,
bring food and medicine.

772
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:22,130
And it seems like there's money involved
in that.

773
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:27,131
It seems like it's just a matter of 
transferring the energy to instead of 

774
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:31,310
only doing it to come to countries where
we blow them up,

775
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,650
let's do it.
The countries that need it,

776
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,680
like make it profitable for countries 
like or companies like Halliburton to 

777
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,000
make money by building up third world 
countries.

778
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,240
Halliburton made over $2,000,000,000
from the Iraq war and a lot of that was 

779
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:53,171
lost during graft and corruption.
Now while this Halliburton Dong to 

780
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:57,560
improve the infrastructure in the United
States,

781
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,210
our country is literally falling apart,
especially in terms of transportation,

782
00:44:02,211 --> 00:44:06,740
especially in terms of cleaning up the 
pollution in our country.

783
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:13,030
Dwight Eisenhower was actually the last 
precedent that paid attention to the 

784
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,260
infrastructure with this interstate 
highway system.

785
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,520
A Bama is trying to do something for the
infrastructure right now,

786
00:44:19,521 --> 00:44:22,910
but he's not having much success in 
getting that through congress.

787
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:28,290
You are absolutely right.
If some subsidy could be given to big 

788
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,980
companies to build up the infrastructure
in the low income parts

789
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,980
of our country to clean up the polluted 
streams and waters and oceans and 

790
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:41,130
rivers,
that would be money well spent.

791
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,110
It just thinking about what we're doing 
with corn.

792
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,500
You know the amount of money in the 
amount of emphasis they put on on on 

793
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:54,021
farmers,
growing corn and the subsidies that are 

794
00:44:54,021 --> 00:44:56,481
involved in that.
It's pretty staggering and that's the 

795
00:44:56,481 --> 00:44:58,671
reason why there's so much corn syrup 
and corn and corn that corn is fucking 

796
00:44:58,671 --> 00:44:58,671
terrible

797
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:03,550
for you and that's why people are 
getting obese because if they're taking 

798
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:08,650
all of the sweetening from the corn 
syrup and look at all the subsidies that

799
00:45:08,651 --> 00:45:13,651
are going to correlate,
there are many natural sweeteners that 

800
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:16,850
do not add weight.
Some of them come from China,

801
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,400
some of them actually can come to the 
United States.

802
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:24,820
Why don't we have more money going into 
those natural sweeteners rather than the

803
00:45:25,881 --> 00:45:30,881
sweeteners like aspartame for example,
that Donald Rumsfeld made money off and 

804
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:39,110
which is worse for you than the sugar in
soft drinks

805
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,280
supposedly.
Yeah.

806
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,370
I've never heard anybody really get 
fucked up from aspartame,

807
00:45:43,371 --> 00:45:46,490
but I've read terrible things about 
potential side effects.

808
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,350
Yes.
But it's so delicious.

809
00:45:48,351 --> 00:45:50,960
And a diet coke,
that's where it's problematic.

810
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,490
Um,
I like Stevia.

811
00:45:52,491 --> 00:45:53,390
Stevia is good stuff.

812
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,020
Steve was good stuff.
Yes.

813
00:45:55,021 --> 00:45:56,050
So go along with that.

814
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:01,120
Great.
Although I have read recently some 

815
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,640
negative things on Stevia,
but someone said that's propaganda and I

816
00:46:01,641 --> 00:46:02,330
haven't looked into it.

817
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,250
Well,
of course,

818
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:08,251
because the competitors are going to 
spread nasty things about something 

819
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:08,251
that's healthy.

820
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

821
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:12,040
The,
the idea that someone can come along and

822
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:15,700
have some natural sweetener that doesn't
put any calories into,

823
00:46:15,701 --> 00:46:20,701
uh,
into your food and it's actually 

824
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:20,701
healthy.
It's very dangerous for the,

825
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:21,700
for the established elite.

826
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,370
I'm going to go back to rolling thunder 
because in our book,

827
00:46:24,371 --> 00:46:29,371
the Voice of Rolling Thunder,
there's a long interview with him about 

828
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:33,331
how he did not pay attention to taking 
sugar into his body and how he got 

829
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:37,831
diabetes and he goes on a long harangue 
trying to urge people to stay away from 

830
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:41,710
sugary drinks,
sugary treats,

831
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:46,890
or they'll end up getting diabetes like 
he did and his diabetes was so bad that 

832
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:53,190
Mickey Hart of the grateful dead and I 
had to fly to his home in the data and 

833
00:46:53,531 --> 00:46:58,531
get him into an airplane.
Bring him back to Mickey Hart's Doctor 

834
00:46:58,531 --> 00:47:03,120
in the San Francisco area who had to 
amputate his leg to save his life from 

835
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:05,620
diabetes.

836
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:10,280
And this is all from just eating sugar 
or is that there's some sort of,

837
00:47:10,281 --> 00:47:11,900
uh,
does he have a natural inclination?

838
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,980
Oh yeah.
She'll know diabetes as something that 

839
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,460
it's ordinary for people to gather.
They reach a certain age,

840
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:22,210
but there was a genetic proclivity along
with that.

841
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:27,510
But he learned his lesson and toward the
end of his life he tried to warn people 

842
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,890
about eating more healthy food,
less sugar.

843
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,020
By the way,
Stan,

844
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,850
while you're talking about a rolling 
thunders genetics,

845
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,070
you might mention your coauthor of the 
book.

846
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
The coauthor of a book is shitty 
enrolling city and Morning Star and city

847
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,150
and morning star is the ground son of 
rolling thunder.

848
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:51,570
And he and I got together and we 
interviewed two dozen people who knew 

849
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:55,381
rolling thunder and told their stories 
in the book that we called the Voice of 

850
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,960
Rolling Thunder because Mickey Hart,
the drummer of the grateful dead,

851
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:03,730
his recorded several dozen speeches of 
rolling thunder over the years.

852
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:08,731
And we got access to those tapes.
And so we actually have the first 

853
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,990
original speeches laced through the 
book.

854
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,390
And so we actually do have the voiceover
length under,

855
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:18,850
in the book is.
There's no audio book though,

856
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:19,960
is there?
Oh,

857
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:23,920
we are hoping there will be an old.com.
Let's get on that.

858
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,190
Yeah,
you've got the original tapes there.

859
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:28,150
That's fantastic.

860
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,180
That's amazing.
Um,

861
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:35,540
you,
you were very fortunate enough to see 

862
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,031
the,
a psychedelic hysteria of the sixties 

863
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:42,310
and see it manifested in,
in law in was in 1970.

864
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:46,180
This sweeping it's schedule one 
psychedelic act that was passed.

865
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,310
What was the impact on culture?
I've always found it was one of the most

866
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:56,040
fascinating areas for this country and 
even humanity that we can study the,

867
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,990
the,
the distance between the fifties and the

868
00:48:58,991 --> 00:49:03,991
sixties.
Like there's never been a time that we 

869
00:49:03,991 --> 00:49:07,951
could ever look at where there's been 
such a gigantic radical change that you 

870
00:49:07,951 --> 00:49:10,630
can really attribute a big part of it to
psychedelics in this country.

871
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,900
Yes.
And also psychedelics of course,

872
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:16,940
should be put down by the political 
establishment today,

873
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,380
but without the psychedelics,
you would have had the,

874
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:26,850
uh,
smart investors who are responsible for 

875
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:27,620
the intranet,
for the cell phone,

876
00:49:27,621 --> 00:49:30,230
for the smartphone,
for computers,

877
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,120
etc.
Etc.

878
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,050
Etc.
Dna replication.

879
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,320
I mEt carrie mullis a couple of weeks 
ago at ted.

880
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:40,870
He won the nobel prize in chemistry for 
coming up with the pca.

881
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:41,720
Yeah,
exactly.

882
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,950
Kary mullis mollison.
He gives Due credit to his work with 

883
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,841
lsd.
I met fraNcis crick And he gives you 

884
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:51,470
credit for his lsd sessions for the 
double helix.

885
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:56,510
So there are many adventures outside of 
the electronics that made changes,

886
00:49:56,511 --> 00:50:00,620
much less the difference in style,
the difference in music,

887
00:50:00,621 --> 00:50:05,621
the difference in sexual behavior.
And historians when they write about 

888
00:50:06,261 --> 00:50:10,490
that area,
do not really give enough credit to what

889
00:50:10,491 --> 00:50:12,920
the psychedelics did in the role that 
they played.

890
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,190
No,
they don't do that.

891
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:15,360
it's a,
it's a weird thing.

892
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,100
So they try to avoid it.

893
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:22,320
They try to avoid it because they're 
afraid it will get censored.

894
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,920
And often a musket censored.
I know of cases where journalists 

895
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,330
written about the role of lsd and other 
psychedelics and social change in their 

896
00:50:32,671 --> 00:50:37,671
editors.
Have a whiteboard that out of the 

897
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:42,090
article and I'll put the article young 
without due credit to lsd.

898
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:47,300
Now you don't get this at all,
the alternative press and you certainly 

899
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,450
don't get this in the show such as 
yours,

900
00:50:48,451 --> 00:50:52,050
which are for a wheel and don't have 
censorship involved with them,

901
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,990
but of course I saw all of this 
firsthand.

902
00:50:54,991 --> 00:50:58,170
I knew Albert Hoffman.
He was a very dear friend of mine.

903
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:03,560
He should have won the nobel prize and 
he would have if lsd had been allowed to

904
00:51:03,631 --> 00:51:08,631
take its aCtual course and help people 
in psychotherapy and creativity of dying

905
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:15,210
and dignified death,
but lsd fell into the wrong hands that 

906
00:51:15,301 --> 00:51:20,301
was victiMized by the government and 
poor Albert Hoffman was very grieved by 

907
00:51:21,781 --> 00:51:22,080
this.

908
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,350
He wasn't grief for not getting enough 
honor himself,

909
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,720
but he had a tool here that could be 
very,

910
00:51:27,721 --> 00:51:31,260
very helpful to people.
And then you had the extremists.

911
00:51:31,261 --> 00:51:34,200
Like my old friend timothy leary,
who I liked very much,

912
00:51:34,201 --> 00:51:39,201
but who I disagreed with going to one 
extreme and saying lsd for all.

913
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,420
And then the government on the other 
hand saying lsd for nobody.

914
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:47,850
It's a dangerous thing.
And people like Richard Nixon,

915
00:51:47,851 --> 00:51:50,520
he's saying timothy leary is public 
enemy number one,

916
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:54,630
the most dangerous man in America.
And where was the middle ground?

917
00:51:54,631 --> 00:51:57,060
People like Jean Houston,
robert masters,

918
00:51:57,061 --> 00:51:59,890
sydney colon osher,
yannick [inaudible],

919
00:51:59,891 --> 00:52:02,880
some of the pioneers who I knew very 
well of that era.

920
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,940
There were cop completely eclipsed and 
they were cut off from legit have the 

921
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:07,940
supplies of lsd.

922
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:13,060
The work with lsd.
The work that uh,

923
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,440
francis crick did with the double helix 
dna.

924
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,720
That's very controversial,
isn't,

925
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:19,760
it?
Wasn't that on his deathbed that he said

926
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,060
that he,
uh,

927
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:24,240
he come to these conclusions was very 
old.

928
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:25,940
This is actually after I met him

929
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,940
when he talked about lsd.
And of course we don't know the role 

930
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:37,091
that,
that actually played in something as 

931
00:52:37,091 --> 00:52:40,361
complicated as The double helix.
Remember tHat his parked or watson 

932
00:52:40,361 --> 00:52:44,860
deserves equal credit.
We never know how much credit to give to

933
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:50,741
somethiNg like that and it's a source.
It's a source of a creative person will 

934
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:53,900
try many things.
Um,

935
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:58,901
I interviewed track zappa for an article
I wrote about the influence of 

936
00:52:58,901 --> 00:53:00,080
psychedelics on art and music and he 
says,

937
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:05,081
I don't know what role psychedelics 
played with my music and artist and 

938
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:09,581
musician will go to many sources and 
we'll pull from life experiences for 

939
00:53:09,581 --> 00:53:11,240
many sources.
And so no,

940
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:15,800
you never know exactly all we can say.
It didn't seem to do with any herb.

941
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:20,470
The harm francis crick.
Did he tell you himself that he had.

942
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,360
No,
this was after I met him.

943
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:25,930
After he met him,
we had a full conversation,

944
00:53:25,931 --> 00:53:26,080
but

945
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:31,080
this was years after I met him that he 
made the statement about lsd because a 

946
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,430
michio kaku wouldn't admit that I had a 
conversation with him on the opiod 

947
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:38,420
anthony show and I asked him about 
francis crick and he completely poopooed

948
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:43,490
instead.
It's nonsense and he's of the belief 

949
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:44,710
that psychedelics are bad for the brain 
and give you brain damage.

950
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,200
Really kind of a disappointing point of 
view when I,

951
00:53:47,201 --> 00:53:52,201
when I talked to him because I,
I recognized right away that he had 

952
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:52,830
never had any experiences with them 
himself.

953
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,830
It was just purely a,
a standard sort of academic.

954
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,680
And uh,
he didn't believe it at all.

955
00:53:59,681 --> 00:54:02,860
He said that it was not true in the 
newspaper this morning.

956
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:06,790
There was a statistic though,
the within the last 12 months,

957
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:12,540
170,000
people have died from prescription 

958
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,180
drugs.
Okay.

959
00:54:13,181 --> 00:54:16,180
How many people have died in the last 12
months from marijuana?

960
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:19,780
How many people have died in the last 12
months from an overdose of lsd?

961
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:25,580
Yeah.
it's ridiculous because it's also when 

962
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,900
you are a mainstream academic,
like a guy like michio kaku,

963
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:32,930
you almost have to talk bad about 
marijuana and illegal drugs and you 

964
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:36,570
almost have to ignore the dangers of 
PresCription drugs.

965
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:39,750
It's reAlly not something that you have,
there's,

966
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:42,360
there's,
there's no benefit in,

967
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,900
in his career toward,
for him taking a controversial.

968
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:51,220
Yeah.
But you know that that's like 

969
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,771
halliburton.
That's like some executive at 

970
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:52,771
halliburton.
Yeah.

971
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:55,581
You know,
it's like you can stand up and say the 

972
00:54:55,581 --> 00:54:58,321
truth,
especially these days is you and I were 

973
00:54:58,321 --> 00:54:58,321
talking about the other day,
you know,

974
00:54:58,321 --> 00:55:01,840
the internet has changed the whole 
communication and the gatekeepers 

975
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,920
getting edged out of the picture.
I mean,

976
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:06,010
andrew weil who's a mutual friend of 
stanley and me,

977
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,270
uh,
you know what I'm talking about,

978
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:10,210
a medical doctor,
a,

979
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:11,050
he was the guy with the white.

980
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:12,320
Exactly.
Yeah.

981
00:55:12,321 --> 00:55:14,390
It's on the cover of time magazine and 
all this,

982
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:19,391
right?
His first three or four booKs are all 

983
00:55:19,391 --> 00:55:21,701
about consciousness and he very openly 
talks about his use of Mushrooms and 

984
00:55:21,701 --> 00:55:26,201
iowasca and you know,
he's ecstasy and he's done all these 

985
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:29,471
things that he talks about,
his experience he took and he's very 

986
00:55:29,471 --> 00:55:30,550
balanced.
The dudes harvard Med school,

987
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:33,500
residency at mass general national 
institute of health,

988
00:55:33,501 --> 00:55:34,490
like top,
top,

989
00:55:34,491 --> 00:55:39,491
top.
And I interviewed him a few months ago 

990
00:55:39,491 --> 00:55:39,491
and so he's like.
And I said to tHem,

991
00:55:39,491 --> 00:55:44,351
I really admire the fact that you've 
never run away from that and you never 

992
00:55:44,351 --> 00:55:44,351
said,
oh,

993
00:55:44,351 --> 00:55:45,210
I was young and stupid.
Like,

994
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,600
no,
the dude is very courageous about it.

995
00:55:47,601 --> 00:55:49,640
And hey,
his career is doing fine.

996
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:54,790
Terence mckenna had a great quote about 
psychedelics that he said that 

997
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:58,301
oftentimes people are doing the work for
the man and that you're worried about 

998
00:55:58,551 --> 00:56:03,551
the man and in worrying about the man 
you actually doing the work of the man 

999
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:03,560
himself.
Right.

1000
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,590
You know,
being that you're censoring yourself and

1001
00:56:06,591 --> 00:56:08,810
that you really,
you don't have to censor yourself nearly

1002
00:56:08,811 --> 00:56:10,280
as much.
You know,

1003
00:56:10,281 --> 00:56:12,710
I,
I'm in a weird field.

1004
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,890
I'm a standup comedian,
but I'm also a sports commentator.

1005
00:56:15,891 --> 00:56:19,910
I do the commentary for the uLtimate 
fighting championShip anD it's on fox tv

1006
00:56:19,911 --> 00:56:24,770
and it's on know fx.
It's on the paper view and it's a,

1007
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:29,830
it's a multibillion dollar business,
but I'm very open about psychedelics and

1008
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:35,291
I'm very open about the positive aspects
oF them that I've experienced myself and

1009
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,890
I've been very fortunate that I've had 
other jobs like standup comedy to always

1010
00:56:39,891 --> 00:56:43,460
fall back on that I never needed to 
worry about censoring myself and I never

1011
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:43,730
saw.

1012
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:48,730
I never thought about it,
but I've experienCed a lot of 

1013
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:50,990
frustration from various people from 
agents and producers and executives were

1014
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:52,190
there.
Like what are you doing?

1015
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:55,610
Like what are you thinking that this is 
going to hurt the big picture.

1016
00:56:55,611 --> 00:57:00,611
This is going to hurt the package is 
going to hurt the things that I'm 

1017
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:00,611
connected to.
It never has.

1018
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:03,530
It never has never got pressure from fox
or anybody don't know.

1019
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,280
Well,
you know what?

1020
00:57:04,281 --> 00:57:06,410
Here's the thing.
Debate me,

1021
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:07,680
sit down,
sit down,

1022
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,410
sit down with me and let's discuss what 
is,

1023
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:12,020
what is the real issue that,
that's a problem here.

1024
00:57:12,021 --> 00:57:13,660
Is it illegality?
Well,

1025
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,530
do you understand the roots of the 
illegality?

1026
00:57:15,531 --> 00:57:18,590
Because it's not based on science.
It's based on hysteria.

1027
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,500
It's based on worry.
It's based on fear is racism,

1028
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,420
but surely when you talk about 
marijuana,

1029
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,580
it propaganda and,
and really,

1030
00:57:25,581 --> 00:57:26,210
uh,
it was uh,

1031
00:57:26,211 --> 00:57:31,211
based on the suppression of hemp as a 
commodity really didn't even have 

1032
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:32,870
anything to do with marijuana as a 
psychoactive drug.

1033
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,690
So anybody who wants to sit down and 
debate with me,

1034
00:57:35,691 --> 00:57:39,800
you're just gonna reinforce my point.
I've talked about this and I've read too

1035
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:41,230
much about this to,
to,

1036
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,650
to step back.
It's,

1037
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:48,330
it seems to me,
and he will be able to speak on this 

1038
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:52,241
because you've seen this happen,
you were there from the fifties and 

1039
00:57:52,241 --> 00:57:55,121
sixties that the psychedelics,
the change that psychedelics can impart 

1040
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:59,900
human beings,
aLthough I think anything can be abuSeD.

1041
00:57:59,901 --> 00:58:04,901
I mean,
I think any humans have a propensity to 

1042
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:07,640
overindulge in almost any sort of 
behavior,

1043
00:58:07,641 --> 00:58:10,160
positive,
ordinary people get addicted to love.

1044
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:15,430
I mean,
people can get obsessed with 

1045
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:15,430
relationships that could,
you know,

1046
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:16,890
under the control of someone with 
discipline or with the,

1047
00:58:16,891 --> 00:58:18,830
you know,
someone who has a grip on reality.

1048
00:58:18,831 --> 00:58:20,720
It could be a great thing.
We,

1049
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:26,260
we have this ability to fuck any out.
but overall I think psychedelics have an

1050
00:58:27,051 --> 00:58:32,051
incredibly positive effect on people 
overall.

1051
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:37,230
You know,
if you look at the broad spectrum of 

1052
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,041
users and talk about johns hopkins had a
recent paper that they published about 

1053
00:58:40,671 --> 00:58:43,310
the longterm effects of suicide in use 
in,

1054
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:44,500
in,
um,

1055
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,290
these people that took it were enhanced 
the personality 20 years later.

1056
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,580
One mushroom trip,

1057
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,610
right?
Yes.

1058
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:55,650
This is one reason why I'm glad that I 
am in mainstream academia.

1059
00:58:55,651 --> 00:58:57,360
I don't have to worry about these 
things.

1060
00:58:57,361 --> 00:59:01,950
I teach at saybrook university,
which is very open minded,

1061
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:05,970
which allows people to do their 
dissertations on iowasca,

1062
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
on lsd,
even on telepathy and we're completely 

1063
00:59:11,371 --> 00:59:13,890
accredited.
Prehistoric sexuality.

1064
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:19,130
YeS.
Chris ryan is one of our most 

1065
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,460
distinguished graduates and wrote his 
dissertation on sexuality.

1066
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:22,380
Saybrook university

1067
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,480
is where whereas san francisco

1068
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:29,860
online university,
people from all over the world can get 

1069
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:33,071
them to credited master's or doctor's 
degree by doing work through their 

1070
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:33,770
computer,
through the internet,

1071
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:38,771
through skype and half person to person 
conversations with me and other faculty 

1072
00:59:38,771 --> 00:59:38,771
members

1073
00:59:38,771 --> 00:59:43,670
should have left san francisco.
San francisco is the free capital of 

1074
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:44,580
this country.
Always will be.

1075
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,100
Well,
it's kinda,

1076
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:50,210
you know,
and it gets back to your point about 

1077
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,161
the,
the cultural effect of psychedelics in 

1078
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:52,161
the sixties,
right.

1079
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:53,090
It san francisco is the place that's 
still vibrating a little bit

1080
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:54,700
from this.
It's still ringing.

1081
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:57,550
The gong still has the,
the.

1082
00:59:57,551 --> 01:00:01,480
I lived in san francisco from the time 
when I was 11 until I was 13,

1083
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:02,980
or actually,
excuse me,

1084
01:00:02,981 --> 01:00:04,650
seven to 11.
Um,

1085
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:08,140
and uh,
it was a fascinating time because it was

1086
01:00:08,141 --> 01:00:13,141
a,
when the Vietnam war was ending and a 

1087
01:00:13,141 --> 01:00:15,130
san francisco was unlike any other place
in the country.

1088
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:16,810
I didn't know it at the time,
of course,

1089
01:00:16,811 --> 01:00:20,140
because I was only seven years old,
but we went from New Jersey,

1090
01:00:20,141 --> 01:00:25,141
which was this barbaric shithole to san 
francisco and then went from san 

1091
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:28,940
francisco to Florida,
which was another barbaric shit.

1092
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:30,070
All.
So it was,

1093
01:00:30,071 --> 01:00:33,880
it was really interesting.
I didn't know what the word nigger meant

1094
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:36,400
until I was 11 years old.
I didn't,

1095
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:38,860
I never heard it.
I've never heard in san francisco.

1096
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,220
I mean the people don't believe that,
but there was,

1097
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:42,660
I didn't experience racism.

1098
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,770
I went to school with black kids,
asian kids.

1099
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,510
everybody was just a kid.
Oh,

1100
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,850
this is bobby.
His family's from Korea.

1101
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,560
This is mike.
His family is black.

1102
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:55,950
There was no,
there was no a weirdness to it until I 

1103
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:57,490
went to Florida.
And then my mother didn't believe me.

1104
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,680
I asked,
I said to my mother,

1105
01:00:59,681 --> 01:01:00,530
I said,
I said,

1106
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:01,750
mom,
what is nigger mean?

1107
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,760
And she said,
you know what it means?

1108
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:04,540
And I go,
no,

1109
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:05,590
I don't know what it means.
Like,

1110
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:06,990
you know,
my mother grew up in New Jersey,

1111
01:01:06,991 --> 01:01:11,991
she probably heard it all the time,
but when we lived in Florida it was the 

1112
01:01:11,991 --> 01:01:12,820
first time I'd heard it in school and I 
had to come to her and that she's like,

1113
01:01:12,821 --> 01:01:15,070
it's a derogatory term for black people.
And I was like,

1114
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:20,071
what?
I was so shocked because from age seven 

1115
01:01:20,071 --> 01:01:22,780
to 11,
I grew up in this really open minded,

1116
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:24,670
intelligent environment.
You know,

1117
01:01:24,671 --> 01:01:27,250
we,
we lived near a lombard street.

1118
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:29,770
We were like in the heart of san 
francisco,

1119
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,920
gay neighbors like gay to me.
And was like,

1120
01:01:32,921 --> 01:01:33,760
oh,
that guy's gay,

1121
01:01:33,761 --> 01:01:35,050
this guy's tall.
You know?

1122
01:01:35,051 --> 01:01:36,520
It was like,
it was just a part of life.

1123
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:39,610
San francisco is a just an amazing,
amazing spot.

1124
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:40,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

1125
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:43,250
I love san francisco.
You know,

1126
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:45,810
I want to hear more about your life.
Every time I come on here,

1127
01:01:45,811 --> 01:01:47,490
we're talking about me.
In this case,

1128
01:01:47,491 --> 01:01:49,650
we're talking about stanley,
which definitely is entry,

1129
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:51,350
but I got to get you on my part.

1130
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,490
We got plenty of time.
I'll do it every year.

1131
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:54,860
More than happy.
Yeah.

1132
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:57,260
My story is a weird one.
it's very strange,

1133
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,880
but I'm the.
One of the coolest things about the 

1134
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:02,880
story is this,
the podcast,

1135
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,750
the ability to have a guy like you on 
have a conversation for hours at a time.

1136
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,400
What was it like?
Did you.

1137
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,220
Were you living in san francisco during 
the sixties?

1138
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:13,220
no,
I was doing the dream telepathy research

1139
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:18,221
in New York city with my mom,
these medical center during the 19 six 

1140
01:02:18,221 --> 01:02:19,420
years,
but once I met becky hart,

1141
01:02:19,421 --> 01:02:22,570
I would take a trip to san francisco a 
couple of times.

1142
01:02:22,571 --> 01:02:27,571
You're in stay at his ranch and rolling 
thunder as well as all other members of 

1143
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:31,150
the grateful dead and the other members 
of the rock community.

1144
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:35,380
Now they got a tour of haight ashbury,
had friends in haight ashbury,

1145
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:40,770
so every time I came to san francisco I 
got myself immersed in the hippie 

1146
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,150
culture.
The psychedelic culture.

1147
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:45,850
LeArned a lot.
Came back to New York city,

1148
01:02:45,851 --> 01:02:50,050
put that knowledge to use in the 
research that we were doing,

1149
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:55,680
and then we actually ran out of money.
I couldn't do the dream telepathy 

1150
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,061
research anymore,
but I got an offer to teach at saybrook 

1151
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:01,960
university and that's when I moved to 
san francisco in the,

1152
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,840
uh,
in the early 19 seventies.

1153
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:08,360
So you moved there right after 
everything became illegal?

1154
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,160
Yes.
That is correct.

1155
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,710
what was the effect on san francisco?
the,

1156
01:03:12,711 --> 01:03:13,210
uh,
the,

1157
01:03:13,211 --> 01:03:14,570
the change from.

1158
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:17,150
Well,
the effect was sort of negative.

1159
01:03:17,151 --> 01:03:22,151
I'll know.
I saw a lot of people who had been 

1160
01:03:22,151 --> 01:03:24,950
dabbling with psychedelics and then they
switched to cocaine.

1161
01:03:24,951 --> 01:03:29,951
Some of them switched to heroin and so 
the illegality had some very negative 

1162
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:38,960
effect upon a lot of young people.
Again,

1163
01:03:38,961 --> 01:03:42,290
not to say that they shouldn't have the 
responsibility was there,

1164
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:45,140
their decision to turn to these harder 
drugs.

1165
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,830
But uh,
the beautiful summer of love didn't last

1166
01:03:48,831 --> 01:03:49,430
very long.

1167
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:54,140
if I don't want to screw up everything,
you know,

1168
01:03:54,141 --> 01:03:55,610
um,
as one of the.

1169
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,410
Did you know terence mckenna at all?
Yes,

1170
01:03:57,411 --> 01:04:02,411
I did.
One of the other things that he said 

1171
01:04:02,411 --> 01:04:05,660
that I found really fascinating was that
what we really learned from the,

1172
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:10,690
the sweeping psychedelic act of 1970 
when they just made everything illegal 

1173
01:04:11,871 --> 01:04:16,871
was how easy it was,
at least at the time to throw water on 

1174
01:04:16,871 --> 01:04:19,730
this revolution,
this revolution from.

1175
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:23,120
I always use buddy holly and jimi 
hendrix as an example.

1176
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:28,480
I'm like,
buddy holly was like a rebel in the 

1177
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:28,480
fifties,
you know,

1178
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:28,480
pig,
pig,

1179
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,660
cu.
You know why I feel blue.

1180
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:35,390
It's like so calm and then you go from 
that to voodoo child,

1181
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:38,990
you know?
I mean early beatles too late beetle.

1182
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:44,020
Yeah.
Very good one to hold your hand to fly 

1183
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:44,020
on the wall.
Risk of.

1184
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:44,020
Well,
you know,

1185
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:44,180
I have a daughter.

1186
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,550
One of my daughters is 16 and she's,
um,

1187
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:50,350
she's really into the beatles.
It's just sheer boyfriends.

1188
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:55,840
Was that time to be dead?
I'm nice.

1189
01:04:56,031 --> 01:04:57,650
I'm easy.
I'm easy.

1190
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:58,500
I,
I,

1191
01:04:58,550 --> 01:04:59,250
you know,
I,

1192
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:04,630
my feeling is boys like girls and girls 
like boys and if you're nice to them to 

1193
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,950
seek out,
I don't mind them.

1194
01:05:06,951 --> 01:05:08,210
I don't,
I really don't.

1195
01:05:08,211 --> 01:05:13,211
I just,
I don't have an attitude that there's 

1196
01:05:13,211 --> 01:05:14,030
something wrong with two kids making out
or doing whatever they do.

1197
01:05:14,031 --> 01:05:16,070
I guess I don't think there's anything 
wrong with it.

1198
01:05:16,071 --> 01:05:18,120
I liked it and remember when I was 16,

1199
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,200
my girlfriend liked it.
It's like it's normal.

1200
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:23,230
I mean it's uh,
it's certainly awkward and strange,

1201
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:27,190
but I'm not a scary dad to me at all.
I'm very friendly.

1202
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,500
But um,
she's a,

1203
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:34,370
she's an interesting kid and she's in 
love with the beatles and I'm.

1204
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,050
One of the things at her and I've been 
talking about was the difference between

1205
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:41,260
the beatles early stuff and then like 
the white album,

1206
01:05:41,261 --> 01:05:46,261
like what this radical transformation 
and that this came about a lot of it 

1207
01:05:46,661 --> 01:05:50,320
because of their fascination with 
altered states of consciousness and then

1208
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:53,620
eastern religions which came directly 
out of that.

1209
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:58,650
Yeah,
it's a real problem with the beatles 

1210
01:05:58,650 --> 01:05:58,650
though is highlighted by my good friend 
bill per,

1211
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:00,670
and that's fucking yoko ono.
how did that.

1212
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:05,850
She is like the one,
like if you wanted to say maybe acid is 

1213
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:07,830
bad for you,
what the fuck john?

1214
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:09,550
like what were you thinking?
Man?

1215
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:11,160
I was just talking to my mom,
yeah,

1216
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:14,970
about this and I didn't know that.
Like everyone hated yoko at time.

1217
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:17,210
Like I always thought everyone liked 
yoga,

1218
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,640
you know back then,
but no,

1219
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,530
everyone hated the back.

1220
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
see,
that's the key to it because because he 

1221
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,340
was such an original thinker,
the fact that everyone was saying,

1222
01:06:25,341 --> 01:06:26,390
john,
you're wrong.

1223
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:29,060
Just makes him say fuck you.
You want to see something cool.

1224
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:32,570
Pull up the video with bill burr on yoko
ono.

1225
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,230
I'm going to bring my friend bill 
burroughs on tuesday.

1226
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,050
Yeah,
one of the funniest guys in the world.

1227
01:06:39,051 --> 01:06:40,730
Really,
really hilarious comedian,

1228
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:45,731
but he was also a huge beatles fan and a
huge chuck berry fan and one time john 

1229
01:06:46,491 --> 01:06:51,491
lennon got to play with chuck berry on 
television and John Lynn and brought 

1230
01:06:52,101 --> 01:06:57,101
yoko ono with him to play as well,
and she sabotaged the entire 

1231
01:06:58,041 --> 01:07:03,041
performance.
He started like screamiNg into the mic 

1232
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:07,750
and bill berg goes absolutely crazy 
about this and highlights and it's.

1233
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:12,990
It's,
it's one of my favorite videos on the 

1234
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:15,470
internet when it comes to music and here
I will play it for you right now

1235
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:22,340
as much as people talk about the beatles
and how great their music is was 

1236
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,940
whatever you want to say.
I totally agree with them.

1237
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:26,550
I think that the greatest band of all 
time,

1238
01:07:26,551 --> 01:07:30,810
but I have to be honest with you.
John lennon and paul mccartney redefined

1239
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:34,890
pussy whipped.
You have to watch this fucking video.

1240
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:38,160
It's john lennon is singing with chuck 
berry.

1241
01:07:38,161 --> 01:07:41,640
Chuck berry is probably one of the main 
reasons why john lennon,

1242
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:44,640
lennon ever picked up a guitar,
so now he's on tv.

1243
01:07:44,641 --> 01:07:49,641
he gets to play with his idol.
They're playIng a chuck berry's hit 

1244
01:07:49,641 --> 01:07:50,360
memphis.
Okay.

1245
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:55,660
John lennon's got yoko in his fucking 
band there in the middle of singing this

1246
01:07:56,021 --> 01:07:58,220
song on television and they're killing 
it.

1247
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:02,090
It's going great.
Yoko's playing some stupid fucking drunk

1248
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:06,020
even though she has no talent 
whatsoever.

1249
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:09,310
He's putting her in the fucking band.
Just she'll,

1250
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,480
she'll shut the fuck up and stop nagging
me.

1251
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:14,900
too much of a fucking pussy to tell her 
that she has.

1252
01:08:14,901 --> 01:08:16,230
No,
no.

1253
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:21,810
All right,
the only reason why you're here yoko's 

1254
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:22,190
because you're sucking my dick.
All right.

1255
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,810
No,
you can't play the bongos.

1256
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,600
But anyway,
she's up there playing the bongos,

1257
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,130
right?
John lennon,

1258
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:33,250
chuck berry,
two of the greats of all time 

1259
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:33,770
harmonizing singing this hit from the 19
fifties.

1260
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:38,980
That's what this moment's above.
And yoko in the middle of it can handle 

1261
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:38,980
that.
She's not getting any shine.

1262
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:41,130
She takes the fucking microphone out of 
the stand,

1263
01:08:41,131 --> 01:08:43,670
starts playing the bongo and as this 
thing and you know,

1264
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:45,410
go go johnny go.
Whatever.

1265
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:50,680
She picks up the mic and I swear to god 
goes some fucking crazy shit.

1266
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:57,190
And you see open as wide as they are and
it's that.

1267
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:01,040
It's that fucking look like a buddy of 
yours.

1268
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:01,870
And he's,
he's,

1269
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:06,871
he's dating some fucking psycho,
but he's in love with her so you can't 

1270
01:09:06,871 --> 01:09:09,821
fucking say anything and you're just 
sitting there waiting for the fucking 

1271
01:09:09,821 --> 01:09:13,100
lightning bolt to hit your friend in the
head where he finally realizes that he's

1272
01:09:13,101 --> 01:09:15,310
dating a psycho chuck berry.

1273
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,920
BuT that's what the fuck she did.
And chuck berry's like,

1274
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:25,640
what the fuck?
And it's kinda like john,

1275
01:09:25,641 --> 01:09:30,641
that's your woman get her in line and 
john lennon does not even fucking,

1276
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:34,220
he doesn't even blink.
He just,

1277
01:09:34,221 --> 01:09:37,430
he just keeps playing and then she does 
it again later on in that song.

1278
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:40,860
And then you look at all the other 
musicians and they just keep playing the

1279
01:09:40,861 --> 01:09:44,800
song like yoko isn't even fucking there.
And uh,

1280
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:47,360
I actually get infuriated when I watched
this video.

1281
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:52,361
The fact that john didn't just stop 
playing in that moment and what he 

1282
01:09:52,361 --> 01:09:54,320
should have done was dressed or down 
right there.

1283
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:59,330
Yes.
I find you want to have a fucking 

1284
01:09:59,330 --> 01:09:59,330
moment.
This is your mom.

1285
01:09:59,330 --> 01:09:59,330
If you ever fucking do that again.
I was slacking.

1286
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:01,580
So fucking heart and the head.
Your eyes are going to look like mine.

1287
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:03,960
You understand me?
You play that fucking buying.

1288
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,010
When you shut your face,
you bitch.

1289
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:07,670
You crawled out of the fucking well and 
ring.

1290
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:08,980
You understand me?
I don't mean to.

1291
01:10:08,981 --> 01:10:10,970
Why I'm fucking.
You are going to be fucking anybody.

1292
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:15,170
You can't play the punk bongos.
You can't say shut your fucking face.

1293
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:17,120
and then he just walks back up to the 
mic.

1294
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:19,520
And just counts the band back in,
right?

1295
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:21,320
Is that what the fuck he should've done.

1296
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,590
There's no perfect people.
That's what it is.

1297
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:32,140
We have to accept that all of our idols 
are flawed.

1298
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:36,400
And even the great john lennon,
beautiful musician and powerful cultural

1299
01:10:36,401 --> 01:10:38,920
figure as he was,
had terrible tasting lemon.

1300
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:42,880
Well I happen to like yoko ono's are.
How dare you.

1301
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,310
How dare you sir?
Hers of mom.

1302
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:51,311
I and I thought it was extremely 
original and very provocative.

1303
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,680
now I don't like what she did with the 
chuck berry.

1304
01:10:54,681 --> 01:10:59,681
John lennon do wet.
She was not completely without tell.

1305
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:06,560
I went to see the yoko ono art exhibit 
when I lived in boston and one of the 

1306
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,131
things that she had was a block of wood 
with nails in it and a bag of nails and 

1307
01:11:10,681 --> 01:11:15,681
a hammer and she encouraged to 
participate in her art and that's what 

1308
01:11:15,841 --> 01:11:19,050
she wanted to do when you walk by,
just pick up a nail and and whack it in.

1309
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:24,290
And that was art and what I had the joke
was if she really wanted to encourage 

1310
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:28,431
people to participate,
she should take the nails and put them 

1311
01:11:28,431 --> 01:11:30,420
in her forehead and there'll be a 
fucking line around the block.

1312
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:33,060
It would be like that scene from 
airplane with a nun,

1313
01:11:33,061 --> 01:11:35,970
with the guitar and boxing gloves.
Everybody will be winding up.

1314
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:38,880
It take a slam and one of those dumb 
nails.

1315
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:44,050
But I should also mention that I had the
great fortune of hearing the beatles at 

1316
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:46,550
their shea stadium concerts,
I should say.

1317
01:11:46,551 --> 01:11:51,551
I saw the beatles because you couldn't 
hear a word they were saying there were 

1318
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:51,551
so much screaming from their fans.

1319
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:52,440
Oh wow.

1320
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:57,810
And so I also use the beatles in some of
my articles about the influence of 

1321
01:11:59,471 --> 01:12:02,830
psychedelics on art and music.
And you're absolutely rIght.

1322
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:08,250
They did make a switch thanks to 
psychedelics there work with the 

1323
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,870
maharishi,
the influence of eastern religions.

1324
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:14,350
George harrison taking up the guitar,
you know,

1325
01:12:14,351 --> 01:12:16,630
like musicians.
They changed the.

1326
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:20,080
Have they evolved sometimes for the 
better sometimes for the worse.

1327
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:25,470
But I think in the beatles case,
they were venturing into new and 

1328
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:25,870
unexplored territory.

1329
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,460
They were two artists,
you know,

1330
01:12:27,461 --> 01:12:29,980
they were really expanding and they 
weren't worried about,

1331
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,140
you know,
sticking to their sound,

1332
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:37,360
you know,
whether it's their acdc sort of riff 

1333
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:37,360
like,
you know,

1334
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,040
the signature rifts and acdc.
I love acdc,

1335
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:44,041
but damn,
he can hurt here an acdc sign a mile 

1336
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:44,041
away.
Once you hear it,

1337
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:44,041
you know,
it's an acdc song.

1338
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:49,230
The beatles really,
really went out there and they took a 

1339
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:52,741
lot of,
like really crazy chances with some of 

1340
01:12:52,741 --> 01:12:52,741
their stuff.

1341
01:12:52,741 --> 01:12:52,741
Yes,
I did.

1342
01:12:52,741 --> 01:12:57,460
And I met rolling thunder through mickey
hart of the grateful dead because 

1343
01:12:58,691 --> 01:13:02,740
rolling thunder song was living in the 
haight ashbury and he nuts.

1344
01:13:02,741 --> 01:13:06,880
Some of the grateful dead.
And when his father rolling thunder came

1345
01:13:06,881 --> 01:13:09,100
to town,
he made the connection.

1346
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:12,640
This is all told about our book,
the voice of rolling thunder.

1347
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:18,020
And that is how rolling thunder got to 
meet bob dylan and participated in the 

1348
01:13:20,471 --> 01:13:25,471
rolling thunder review.
And so there's a lot of rock and roll 

1349
01:13:25,471 --> 01:13:26,170
stuff that's part of the rolling thunder
legends

1350
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:31,250
yesterday in the car in stanley.
And I were talking about some of the 

1351
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:34,521
musicians he's known over the years and 
he mentioned that hendrix was opening 

1352
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,680
for the monkees.
Whoa,

1353
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:39,980
you are talking about getting blown up 
the stage.

1354
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:47,460
Take my stepchildren to hear the monkeys
because they loved the monkeys and jimi 

1355
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:53,791
hendrix opened for the monkeys and I 
told them he is going to be a major rock

1356
01:13:54,911 --> 01:13:57,520
and roll star.
Never forget that name.

1357
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:03,180
And they didn't.
And a few years later the monkeys were 

1358
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:06,691
forgotten.
And jimi hendrix was a classic poor 

1359
01:14:06,691 --> 01:14:06,691
monkeys.
Yeah.

1360
01:14:06,691 --> 01:14:09,430
They didn't do so badly.
They each went onto their own career.

1361
01:14:09,431 --> 01:14:10,650
They,
you know,

1362
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:11,410
found please.

1363
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,020
No big deal.
I mean they were fine.

1364
01:14:15,021 --> 01:14:16,310
They were cute.
I like the monkeys.

1365
01:14:16,311 --> 01:14:18,320
When I was a little kid,
one of the first,

1366
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:22,820
a fake bands.
They were like the first boy band.

1367
01:14:22,821 --> 01:14:25,340
Really essentially the manufactured boy 
band.

1368
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,680
Now when you see like the,
the,

1369
01:14:27,681 --> 01:14:30,230
you know,
back in the day where it was the beatles

1370
01:14:30,231 --> 01:14:32,570
and you know,
and elvis and they,

1371
01:14:32,571 --> 01:14:35,600
that was the teeny bopper thing.
And now you see like justin bieber,

1372
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:40,990
isn't that sort of a sign of the times,
you know that that's the teeny bopper 

1373
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:45,341
now it's Like the,
the teeny bopper is an 18 year old that 

1374
01:14:45,341 --> 01:14:45,350
looks like a 12 year old girl.
Yeah,

1375
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,780
girl.
He's looking for any sings like a girl,

1376
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:48,560
you know,
it's,

1377
01:14:48,570 --> 01:14:50,030
it's,
it's very odd.

1378
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:55,060
Like wow,
we're in this really strange time of 

1379
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:57,110
almost like a suspended adolescent 
suspended childhood.

1380
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:02,300
Like they want to contain it and carry 
it and he sort of the ideal spokesperson

1381
01:15:02,301 --> 01:15:03,710
for that.
And I wonder,

1382
01:15:03,711 --> 01:15:08,711
I don't know enough about the history of
fashion and so on to know whether this 

1383
01:15:08,711 --> 01:15:12,401
is true or not.
But it seems like since the late 

1384
01:15:12,401 --> 01:15:12,401
eighties,
nineties,

1385
01:15:12,401 --> 01:15:16,160
somewhere we started like circling in 
terms of fashion,

1386
01:15:16,161 --> 01:15:17,810
right?
Like disco came back,

1387
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,760
you know,
and very briefly,

1388
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:21,100
pat bell bottoms,
barely.

1389
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:22,900
They tried to come back to.
Yeah.

1390
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:23,780
But it seems,
doesn't,

1391
01:15:23,781 --> 01:15:28,781
it sort of feels like,
like we've come to the end of the line 

1392
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:33,791
in some way.
So now they're trying to circle around 

1393
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:33,791
and reduce stuff.

1394
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:33,830
Oh,
there's nothing new under the sun.

1395
01:15:33,831 --> 01:15:38,831
You know what's old today is new 
tomorrow and this is just part of the 

1396
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,590
fashion cycle that's been happening for 
centuries.

1397
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:48,100
I think that what's most interesting and
even a little bit dangerous as the 

1398
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:52,010
prolonging of adolescents with adults,
right?

1399
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:55,130
Adults who are acting like they're 
teenagers.

1400
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,150
I don't Have any problem with justin 
bieber or any of the teeny bopper,

1401
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:04,330
favorites yellow,
that's their thing and they're welcome 

1402
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:06,881
to do it,
but when adults start to act like 

1403
01:16:06,881 --> 01:16:09,440
teenagers and start acting out and start
to behave irresponsibly,

1404
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,830
I think this is where people really have
to grow up,

1405
01:16:12,831 --> 01:16:16,070
especially with all of the crises in the
country and the crises in the world,

1406
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:21,090
like what do you.
What examples to use like adults acting 

1407
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:21,090
like teenagers

1408
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:25,420
years.
I think that there is a tendency for 

1409
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:29,930
some adults to look at theIr kids as 
pals and say,

1410
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,020
oh,
my daughter is my best friend.

1411
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:34,730
I'm her best friend.
Well,

1412
01:16:34,731 --> 01:16:36,530
this is nonsense.
You're the mother.

1413
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,900
You're not the best friend of your 
daughter.

1414
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,570
You lay down the rules,
you give them instructions.

1415
01:16:41,571 --> 01:16:43,850
You teach your daughter how to become an
adult.

1416
01:16:43,851 --> 01:16:46,400
You teach moral codes.
You teach rules,

1417
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:48,890
you teach regulations,
you serve as a role model.

1418
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,320
What's this best friends?
Crap,

1419
01:16:51,321 --> 01:16:51,570
all of them.

1420
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:56,890
You can't be both.
You can be a best friend as well as a 

1421
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:57,670
role model.
Someone who lays down.

1422
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:03,050
I would not say never.
All that I could say is that role 

1423
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:04,090
confusion is not really part of parents.

1424
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,460
What about when you see like a man in 
his thirties and he sagging his pants?

1425
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:09,020
Have you witnessed that?
Yes.

1426
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,390
How about that?
Is that the weirdest thing ever?

1427
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:17,500
You've seen some shit and your day.
Just the sagging pants thing really 

1428
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,170
makes me worry about the future of 
humanity.

1429
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:23,200
Grown men,
grown men that are probably going to 

1430
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:23,200
have babies of their own.
See this justin?

1431
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:27,851
Nothing wrong with this.
Polo except for a stupid baggy pants 

1432
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:29,660
sagging and you understand that.
Burn,

1433
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:30,380
that sagging.

1434
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:31,700
Is that what that is?
Yeah,

1435
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:36,680
they all sag thai fishing with justin 
bieber having saggy pants.

1436
01:17:36,681 --> 01:17:41,030
I have troubLe with grown men having 
Saggy pants trying to be teenagers.

1437
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,260
What the fuck is that about?

1438
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,450
I know a Dude,
he's.

1439
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:46,030
I love him to death,
but wheN he was like 39,

1440
01:17:46,031 --> 01:17:48,840
he starts sagging his pants.
I was like,

1441
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:53,850
come on son,
and that's just when you need something 

1442
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:53,850
to hold your balls up.
Anyway.

1443
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:53,850
Yeah.
That's when they start going.

1444
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:55,600
Maybe that's what it is.
You just didn't want the tickle.

1445
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:59,500
The parents hitting the base of his 
balls as his balls dropped.

1446
01:17:59,501 --> 01:18:04,501
He tried to compensate.
It's like a comb over with his pants 

1447
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:08,310
were silly and I think,
uh,

1448
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:13,330
there's a,
there's a prolonged silliness or from 

1449
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:15,760
the seventies to today,
but I think that what's going on today,

1450
01:18:15,761 --> 01:18:20,110
over the last decade or so as I think 
that even though there's still plenty of

1451
01:18:20,111 --> 01:18:21,460
silliness,
like justin bieber,

1452
01:18:21,461 --> 01:18:23,310
and again,
I have nothing against justin.

1453
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:26,810
He's a child and he makes music for 
other children and you know,

1454
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:31,830
who knows,
maybe one day from now we'll look back 

1455
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:31,830
and say,
well,

1456
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:32,290
this was when justin bieber was a child.
Now look,

1457
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:37,291
he's this brilliant adult musician 
making this really cool shit and are 

1458
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:37,291
sure.
Yeah,

1459
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:40,150
happened to ricky martin.
He was part of the noodle.

1460
01:18:40,151 --> 01:18:45,151
This boy's bound from puerto rico.
Who would have guessed that he would 

1461
01:18:45,151 --> 01:18:47,620
become a broadway star and a brilliant 
broadway

1462
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:49,250
is easy on broadway now.

1463
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:50,650
Yeah.
She just said les miserables.

1464
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:55,680
He is an a and I saw him in las vegas.
One of the best acts I've ever seen in 

1465
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:58,450
las vegas.
She's a marvelous musician.

1466
01:18:58,451 --> 01:19:03,451
He's gotten rave reviews for his role in
a bed where he plays shake lavar of all 

1467
01:19:03,451 --> 01:19:03,451
people.

1468
01:19:03,451 --> 01:19:05,870
Stem kripner,
ricky martin fan.

1469
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,420
Absolutely.
Now you know,

1470
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:09,350
he's full of stuff,
right?

1471
01:19:09,351 --> 01:19:11,030
You live in la vida loca.
I just want to know.

1472
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:12,350
Oh,

1473
01:19:12,351 --> 01:19:16,640
Great to live in love.
You know,

1474
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,620
he's a talented guy.
Nothing wrong with that,

1475
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:19,880
you know.
And uh,

1476
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:22,620
and finally out of the closet too,
I think that's another,

1477
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,060
another beautiful thing that.

1478
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:29,240
Well he's commanded for that.
And lady gaga who I also like,

1479
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:34,910
she has born that wave that probably 
saved the life of dozens of gay and 

1480
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:36,330
lesbian kids.

1481
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:37,990
Yeah.
That's a sad,

1482
01:19:37,991 --> 01:19:42,991
sad,
sad thing about this world is that 

1483
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:42,991
that's still an issue.
You know,

1484
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:43,900
in the wild is gay marriage debate is 
going on.

1485
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:49,170
You know,
who knows what kind of creepy shit 

1486
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:51,090
getting passed through congress.
It's not even getting public 

1487
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:53,341
recognition.
Everybody's paying attention to whether 

1488
01:19:53,341 --> 01:19:55,951
or not people should have the right to 
do whatever they want sexually with 

1489
01:19:55,951 --> 01:19:59,611
someone who also wants to do with them.
So it's a strange thing that I always 

1490
01:19:59,611 --> 01:20:02,830
sort of say it's like,
it's almost like a cultural beach ball.

1491
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:08,090
You know,
if you're in a concert and someone 

1492
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:08,090
throws a beach ball and it goes up and 
comes down,

1493
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:08,090
like,
you know,

1494
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:11,220
it's like nothing ever fucking happened.
It just kind of gets tossed around.

1495
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:13,260
Like,
what do you think about gay marriage?

1496
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:14,070
You know,
just like,

1497
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:19,100
oh no,
what do affirmative action and nothing 

1498
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:22,011
ever gets fixed,
but they just get sort of tossed around 

1499
01:20:22,011 --> 01:20:22,011
back and forth.
whenever this.

1500
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:27,390
I'm going to go back to sharmane because
in shamanic traditions around the world,

1501
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:32,890
what we would call gay and lesbian 
people were given a great deal of honor.

1502
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:35,230
Many of them became dancers,
singers,

1503
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:40,231
even shamans and native americans.
Not 100 percent,

1504
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:42,790
but most native americans said,
look,

1505
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:47,940
here's somebody who acts like a woman 
likes members of his own gender or her 

1506
01:20:51,401 --> 01:20:56,401
own gender.
Depending on which one you're talking 

1507
01:20:56,401 --> 01:20:58,501
about,
the great spirit must have devoted some 

1508
01:20:58,501 --> 01:20:59,230
very special time to making them that 
way,

1509
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:02,950
so we have to give them special honor 
and respect them.

1510
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:05,740
Now the europeans came in,
oh,

1511
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:08,290
that's terrible.
Let's get the inquisition on them,

1512
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:11,350
and they killed what we would call gays 
and lesbians.

1513
01:21:11,351 --> 01:21:14,470
They killed shamans.
They killed them sometimes very,

1514
01:21:14,471 --> 01:21:17,140
very brutally,
and at the same time,

1515
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:22,350
the europeans gave much less power to 
women than the native americans did.

1516
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:27,460
Native americans gave a lot of power to 
women in their governing councils,

1517
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,120
in their decision making and in their 
families.

1518
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:32,270
Yeah.

1519
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:38,400
Nowhere american came over.
The europeans came over and storm the 

1520
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,010
place because checks were running 
everything.

1521
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:44,100
Yeah.
that's the greatest genocide in the 

1522
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:44,850
history.
Probably a million native americans died

1523
01:21:44,851 --> 01:21:47,460
in north America.
Ten millions died in south America.

1524
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:48,750
Mainly through disease.

1525
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,170
Yeah,
it's a.

1526
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:55,171
It's the weirdest story.
If you stop and think about how quickly 

1527
01:21:55,571 --> 01:22:00,571
it changed here in America,
in north America from the time the 

1528
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:03,950
columbus and you know from the,
the 14 hundreds to the,

1529
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,180
you know,
the nIneteen hundreds or whatever today,

1530
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:10,990
I mean it's an insane episode of 
genocide

1531
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:18,150
to be that way.
There's pretty good evidence that the 

1532
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:20,520
chinese came to the pacific coast and 
even further down in maybe the early 14,

1533
01:22:22,331 --> 01:22:27,331
hundreds maybe earlier and they were 
there to learn from the people to take 

1534
01:22:27,611 --> 01:22:31,420
samples back to China.
They didn't and they didn't say,

1535
01:22:31,421 --> 01:22:36,421
this is going to be part of China.
We're going to make these people under 

1536
01:22:36,421 --> 01:22:39,901
good buddhists.
They respected what they did and they 

1537
01:22:39,901 --> 01:22:40,390
got their information and they'd sell it
back to China.

1538
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:46,050
No,
the europeans who were there to brIng 

1539
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:47,230
people to the true religion,
they were there to trade,

1540
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,680
to get gold,
to get mark,

1541
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:55,710
to get first,
to enrich the old world At the expense 

1542
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:55,710
of the new work.

1543
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:57,790
It is an amazing time though,
if you look,

1544
01:22:57,791 --> 01:23:02,791
if you look at a timeline,
like an animated timeline of the world 

1545
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:06,480
and then showed north America and north 
America from the of the first europeans

1546
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:11,580
and then this massive change that takes 
place over this continent over the 

1547
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:13,090
course of the next several hundred 
years,

1548
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:18,330
gigantic cities just to rub the biggest 
cities in the world has ever known 

1549
01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:20,160
military complex builds up in nuclear 
bombs,

1550
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:21,640
start getting developed.
You know,

1551
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:26,700
tHe internet airplanes,
all this shit happens in this one 

1552
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,450
continent.
I mean there's this one continent.

1553
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:33,470
Essentially the last big continent to 
get established by human beings becomes 

1554
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:36,760
the craziest motherfucker have.
Out of all.

1555
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:37,530
You know,
it's.

1556
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:40,990
It's really weird if you look at it from
a historical timeline,

1557
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:46,230
the massive amount of impact that these 
immigrants have had coming over from 

1558
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:48,100
europe and other parts of the world to 
this one spot.

1559
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,670
YeaH.
It could have happened a different way.

1560
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:55,970
What we call Mexico city,
what they called a kyoto or calm or turn

1561
01:23:55,971 --> 01:24:00,971
up slot and Mexico.
That was a bigger city than london and 

1562
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:03,420
the sewers were clean.
The spaniards came.

1563
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:06,330
They couldn't believe how clean the city
was,

1564
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,870
and then of course they ruined it at 
all.

1565
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:13,020
How they ruined it,
they ruined it all because they wanted 

1566
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:17,510
gold and they took the spaniards ruined 
it and they took botha zuma,

1567
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:23,330
they a tortured him.
They killed him even though he filled a 

1568
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:27,831
room full of gold with them.
The same thing happened in Peru with 

1569
01:24:27,831 --> 01:24:27,831
pizarro and whoa,
whoa,

1570
01:24:27,831 --> 01:24:28,130
whoa,
whoa.

1571
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:29,130
Here.
That,

1572
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:32,250
there were these great empowers with 
magnificent cities,

1573
01:24:32,251 --> 01:24:37,251
magnificent libraries.
THe mayan libraries were all burned to 

1574
01:24:37,251 --> 01:24:40,911
the pieces.
We don't know the mayan wisdom because 

1575
01:24:40,911 --> 01:24:40,911
the preset,
all of that,

1576
01:24:40,911 --> 01:24:41,970
this pagan stuff,
we have to get rid of it.

1577
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:47,330
So there was a very,
very different mentality that as you 

1578
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:51,081
say,
completely changed things and then 

1579
01:24:51,081 --> 01:24:52,050
things tend to start all over again.
It took a much different routes.

1580
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,290
well,
the,

1581
01:24:53,291 --> 01:24:58,291
um,
the aztecs did some fucking crazy shit 

1582
01:24:58,291 --> 01:24:58,291
themselves,

1583
01:24:58,291 --> 01:24:59,910
say sacrifice,
but at the same time,

1584
01:24:59,911 --> 01:25:04,911
the iNquisition in Spain and in Germany 
and in parts of France and Italy,

1585
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,740
we're also killing people by burning 
them at the stake.

1586
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:11,460
I don't let the aztec soft for the human
sacrifice,

1587
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:13,110
but you know,
let's be fair.

1588
01:25:13,111 --> 01:25:15,690
Let's look what happens with the other 
part of the world.

1589
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:17,680
Yeah.
Didn't they sacrifice like,

1590
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:21,290
I think over the course of like,
I'm going to look it up.

1591
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:26,291
I think over the course of four days,
they sacrifice some insane number of 

1592
01:25:26,291 --> 01:25:27,680
80,000
people.

1593
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:29,060
Um,
the,

1594
01:25:29,061 --> 01:25:30,540
uh,
the pyramid of tea.

1595
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:35,220
I don't know how to ican after they,
um,

1596
01:25:35,690 --> 01:25:38,090
in 14,
87 after the construction of it,

1597
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:42,620
they sacrificed all the prisoners that 
they use to make it 80,000

1598
01:25:42,621 --> 01:25:43,430
people who.

1599
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:48,850
And one reason that they did all of the 
sacrifices is they thought that the gods

1600
01:25:49,190 --> 01:25:54,190
were angry at them by bringing in the 
spaniards and bringing in all of the 

1601
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:56,960
diseases started to kill people off.
So like I say,

1602
01:25:56,961 --> 01:26:01,961
no,
I'm not listening to the aztecs offer 

1603
01:26:01,961 --> 01:26:04,000
the sacrifices.
That was a flaw in their civilization 

1604
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,911
that the very important for.
But they did create clean and beautiful 

1605
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:09,170
cities and they did have a forum

1606
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:14,200
of government that work and they,
the artwork and the streets where you 

1607
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,500
mentioned the sewage,
they had sewer systems.

1608
01:26:15,501 --> 01:26:17,720
And they also had a,
the streets lit at night,

1609
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:22,721
if I remember correctly,
three seats for the night and you're 

1610
01:26:22,721 --> 01:26:22,721
going to lamps or something like that.
I don't know.

1611
01:26:22,721 --> 01:26:24,370
Do you know they weren't gas lamps for 
sure.

1612
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:27,500
Probably tortured,
but it was built.

1613
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:32,590
It was an island in the middle of a big 
lake and it only had like one or two 

1614
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:35,510
causeway.
So it was perfectly defendable.

1615
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:39,550
But they'd invited cortez and his guys 
in.

1616
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:44,830
It was such a mess.
And one of the theories that you might 

1617
01:26:44,830 --> 01:26:47,740
know more about this than I do,
but I'm the vikings came down to north 

1618
01:26:47,871 --> 01:26:51,170
America much earLier,
like the 10th century or Something.

1619
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:56,410
AnD one of the theories was that they 
had gotten this far south as Mexico 

1620
01:26:56,410 --> 01:27:00,890
because there was a myth that the.
There was a white god that came from the

1621
01:27:00,891 --> 01:27:04,250
east and said he'd returned someday.
And so when they found,

1622
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:05,810
when the spanish showed up,
they're like,

1623
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:06,470
ah,
you know,

1624
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,270
it's the second coming.
Well,

1625
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:12,680
the viking is of course are now 
memorialized by the current tv series,

1626
01:27:12,681 --> 01:27:15,280
which is not bad by the way.
It's really.

1627
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:18,950
And they just start the advice.
It's good.

1628
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:19,890
Yup.
And the

1629
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:25,340
kings had a very,
very important impact on not only 

1630
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:25,440
europe,
but yes,

1631
01:27:25,441 --> 01:27:30,441
they came and visited the north America.
they didn't kill off native american 

1632
01:27:30,441 --> 01:27:31,920
indians.
They collaborated with them.

1633
01:27:31,921 --> 01:27:34,650
They learned from them.
They had their colonies.

1634
01:27:34,651 --> 01:27:37,800
Then things got a little too chilly and 
cold and uncomfortable.

1635
01:27:37,801 --> 01:27:42,801
So they sailed back,
but they did not leave the legacy of 

1636
01:27:42,801 --> 01:27:46,611
destruction and disease that the english
and the spaniards and the portuguese did

1637
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:52,640
much later on.
And one interesting thing about the 

1638
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:56,400
white god legend is that when the core 
cast came,

1639
01:27:56,820 --> 01:28:01,820
he came at just the right time.
The legend was the 30th day of the 30th 

1640
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:04,680
month,
the white god will come.

1641
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:10,070
And so every time in that cycle that the
white god was supposed to come,

1642
01:28:11,191 --> 01:28:14,510
they had scouts on the gulf of Mexico 
believable.

1643
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:19,520
Not cortez came just when the prediction
was there and they welcomed him with 

1644
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:24,231
open arms.
I think it was one of the cruelest 

1645
01:28:24,231 --> 01:28:27,591
coincidences,
the history of humankind that became a 

1646
01:28:27,591 --> 01:28:28,320
just the right time.
So he was welcomed.

1647
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:30,990
You think that's a coincidence though?
I'm,

1648
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:34,260
I'm,
I'm not into mysticism,

1649
01:28:34,261 --> 01:28:39,261
so I would say that that was either a 
coincidence or else they got their facts

1650
01:28:39,811 --> 01:28:40,590
wrong.
Well,

1651
01:28:40,591 --> 01:28:42,010
you're not in the mysticism,
but yeah,

1652
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:43,490
you are.
You are.

1653
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:46,170
If you're talking about this psychic 
dreaming,

1654
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,130
that mystic,
I considered that quantum physics.

1655
01:28:50,131 --> 01:28:52,920
I think this is something that 
ultimately be.

1656
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:55,800
We'll be explainable in terms of enlarge
rural deal.

1657
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:59,490
You don't think that there's a possible 
connection that may be mean.

1658
01:28:59,491 --> 01:29:01,980
do you believe that there's a for the

1659
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,980
world?
Do you believe that it's possible that 

1660
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:07,920
you know all these things that are 
foretold that come to be true?

1661
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,890
absolute bullshit.
One hundred percent bullshit.

1662
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:13,550
I think that.
See,

1663
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,840
I come from the point of view of 
evolution,

1664
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:20,960
watch adaptive watch.
Adaptive is not always for the best of 

1665
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:25,941
the world.
If we were to have an atomic bomb blast 

1666
01:29:25,941 --> 01:29:27,300
who would adapt?
It would be the young sex.

1667
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:32,660
Humans would be gone.
insects would be the ones who survive 

1668
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:34,500
because they could adapt.
They could withstand the atomic bomb.

1669
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:39,750
Key points and key three.
My point though is that as you saw the 

1670
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,900
kennedy assassination in a in a psychic 
vision,

1671
01:29:41,901 --> 01:29:46,901
is it possible that these people saw the
cortez in a psychic vision or who was 

1672
01:29:49,401 --> 01:29:52,340
often referred to as a white beard in 
god?

1673
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:57,500
It was counseled people who according to
the legends sailed off into the gulf of 

1674
01:29:57,721 --> 01:29:59,780
Mexico and said,
I will return around.

1675
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:04,820
Just like douglas macarthur said,
I should've returned during the second 

1676
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:08,010
world war except capsule was a mythical 
figure,

1677
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:13,580
and again,
he he not only said that he would 

1678
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:16,461
return,
but the Legend SpecifieD when in the 

1679
01:30:16,461 --> 01:30:19,200
cycle he would return.
Now that has this incredible coincidence

1680
01:30:19,201 --> 01:30:22,440
that I'm not going to explain.
I'm just going to point it out.

1681
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:23,730
Yeah,
I mean,

1682
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:27,630
I would think though that if you're 
willing to consider the possibility that

1683
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:32,631
you had this vision of kennedy,
he might consider the possibility of 

1684
01:30:32,631 --> 01:30:34,050
long range visions that people,
these,

1685
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:38,130
these aztecs and mayans are sitting 
around taking mushrooms,

1686
01:30:38,131 --> 01:30:42,300
contemplating the future might have a 
vision of these white men showing up.

1687
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:43,330
Well,
why not?

1688
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:48,460
Yellow time is a social construct and 
native americans have the,

1689
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:54,390
at least before the europeans arrived,
they had the concept of the long body 

1690
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:57,310
that our physical body is the short 
body,

1691
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:02,520
but the body extends into the future.
Now that long bodies can sometimes pick 

1692
01:31:03,281 --> 01:31:07,120
up information from the future that it 
brings back to the short body.

1693
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:12,480
This is part of his metaphorical,
but to them it would be no surprise when

1694
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:19,080
rolling thunder talked about global 
warming and when he talked about 

1695
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,460
desertification and the pollution of the
air,

1696
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:26,230
he was basing this on his observation of
what was going on,

1697
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:29,530
but also he was going back to native 
american prophecy.

1698
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:33,060
I love that term.
Long body in short potty.

1699
01:31:33,061 --> 01:31:34,460
That's really fascinating.

1700
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:39,790
Oh,
the native americans said all sorts of 

1701
01:31:39,790 --> 01:31:40,610
concepts that are consistent with 
quantum physics.

1702
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:45,620
We devote a whole section of quantum 
physics and our book about rolling 

1703
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:49,511
thunder,
the voice of rolling thunder and there 

1704
01:31:49,511 --> 01:31:49,670
is an entire book called blackfoot 
physics,

1705
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:54,910
which takes the blackfoot indian tribe,
shows how closely their philosophy of 

1706
01:31:55,371 --> 01:32:00,371
the earth corresponds to modern day 
quantum physics.

1707
01:32:00,741 --> 01:32:03,760
So book by david pete,
who's a quantum physicist themselves,

1708
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:09,060
what do they attribute the this,
this information from like the black 

1709
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,780
feet say,
how do they learn these concepts

1710
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:16,090
passed down over the generations.
You can see some of it and the rock 

1711
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:20,231
carvings,
but mainly the myths and legends that 

1712
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:22,980
have been passed down.
Remember that most of the native 

1713
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:23,720
americans did not have a written 
language.

1714
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,180
The mayans had the very good rep 
language,

1715
01:32:26,181 --> 01:32:31,181
but it didn't do them,
and you're good because the spaniards 

1716
01:32:31,181 --> 01:32:33,401
berg,
all of their books and so this was 

1717
01:32:33,401 --> 01:32:35,510
passed down from tribe to tribe,
from person to person from atlanta clan,

1718
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:40,840
and you can see it today and the legends
that they talk about how the earth and 

1719
01:32:42,741 --> 01:32:47,741
how the people in the earth are part of 
a whole and how hard of a swerve a 

1720
01:32:48,771 --> 01:32:53,300
change can have ripple effects that 
affect the entire organism,

1721
01:32:53,301 --> 01:32:56,630
the entire family,
the entire clown,

1722
01:32:56,631 --> 01:33:01,631
the fire in the entire cosmos.
I'm also gonna talk about parallel 

1723
01:33:01,631 --> 01:33:04,250
universes,
which was a quantum physics concept.

1724
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:07,040
They talk about the upper world,
the lower world,

1725
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:08,000
the middle earth.

1726
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:13,850
I'm going to throw something out at you 
and tell me if this makes any sense 

1727
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:17,000
because this is something that I've been
contemplating myself over the last few 

1728
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,270
years and that that's the idea that 
human behavior,

1729
01:33:18,271 --> 01:33:23,271
even the most complex and in self 
destructive of all human behavior is 

1730
01:33:23,271 --> 01:33:27,411
natural and that like we see complex 
social communities in wolf tribes and 

1731
01:33:28,501 --> 01:33:30,480
wolf packs and with,
uh,

1732
01:33:30,481 --> 01:33:34,170
with various animals and we see the way 
they interact and we say,

1733
01:33:34,171 --> 01:33:35,430
oh,
this is just nature.

1734
01:33:35,431 --> 01:33:39,480
This is the way to sort things out on a 
much more complex scale.

1735
01:33:39,481 --> 01:33:41,570
Is it possible that all the self 
destruction,

1736
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:46,580
all the,
the crazy battles for resources that 

1737
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:50,361
we've seen in the world today,
that all of this is in fact just a 

1738
01:33:50,361 --> 01:33:53,751
natural behavior pattern.
And it's literally the only way that 

1739
01:33:53,751 --> 01:33:58,161
human beings exist in that this strange,
a contrast between massive amounts of 

1740
01:34:00,541 --> 01:34:05,541
information being available and being 
spread rapidly back and forth between 

1741
01:34:05,541 --> 01:34:07,770
people and all these horrible injustices
that are all going on.

1742
01:34:07,771 --> 01:34:09,150
At the same time,
it's,

1743
01:34:09,151 --> 01:34:11,550
that's the yin and the yang of human 
humanity.

1744
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:16,020
That's a good way to put it.
This is the yin and the yang.

1745
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:19,530
The balance.
People are neither good nor bAd.

1746
01:34:19,531 --> 01:34:23,850
They're both and the way that society 
constructs their behavior,

1747
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,400
conserve them one way or the other,

1748
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:30,620
and also that like while we're doing 
battle with these evils,

1749
01:34:30,621 --> 01:34:35,621
this is what propels innovation.
THis is what sort of propels people to 

1750
01:34:35,621 --> 01:34:40,541
move forward.
That if we lived in some sort of a 

1751
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:40,541
utopian,
you know,

1752
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:45,640
beautiful society of orgiastic love,
that maybe we'd never get anything done 

1753
01:34:46,011 --> 01:34:49,580
and maybe that's part of what the human 
animals here for in the first place,

1754
01:34:49,581 --> 01:34:53,120
like the aunt makes the ant hill.
The b makes the honeycomb,

1755
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:57,170
the human being creates this uber 
complex society,

1756
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,160
one of the

1757
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:03,160
mechanisms to ensure that society keeps 
moving forth at this breakneck speed is 

1758
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:07,460
this conflict,
this constant conflict that's going on,

1759
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:10,950
both social conflict,
economic conflict,

1760
01:35:10,951 --> 01:35:15,951
that all this is a part of this gigantic
ever complex natural behavior pattern.

1761
01:35:18,790 --> 01:35:22,630
It certainly is natural,
but don't overlook the other side of it.

1762
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:27,130
When you go to darwin and read what he 
had to say,

1763
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:32,550
he uses terms like love cooperation,
collaboration much more often than he 

1764
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:40,021
uses conflict.
He sees this cooperation is what 

1765
01:35:40,021 --> 01:35:44,490
engineers evolution and social progress.
He never used the word the words a 

1766
01:35:46,630 --> 01:35:49,000
survival of the fittest.
Somebody else use that.

1767
01:35:49,001 --> 01:35:52,770
He didn't like that term.
He was more emphasis,

1768
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,540
more empathetic,
um,

1769
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:59,590
collaboration and even love.
Those are the words you find in his 

1770
01:35:59,590 --> 01:35:59,590
books.

1771
01:35:59,590 --> 01:35:59,590
When I,
when I,

1772
01:35:59,590 --> 01:36:01,010
when I speak of these things,
when I'm,

1773
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:05,480
what I'm saying is almost like as if I 
was someone from another world,

1774
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:08,390
if I was looking at the human race,
a completely objective,

1775
01:36:08,391 --> 01:36:13,391
lee and I'm looking at what one of these
crazy things doing and what direction 

1776
01:36:13,391 --> 01:36:17,261
and if we were trying to study them and 
trying to figure out what's causing all 

1777
01:36:17,261 --> 01:36:18,770
this stuff to be taking place at the 
same time,

1778
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:21,440
I almost would would look at it that 
way.

1779
01:36:21,441 --> 01:36:26,441
Then it's like maybe it's,
this is really complex natural behavior 

1780
01:36:26,441 --> 01:36:30,370
that's moving towards some sort of.
It means seems to be some sort of 

1781
01:36:30,370 --> 01:36:33,160
technological integration.
I mean it seems to be that that's what's

1782
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:36,490
the number one push.
If we look at where it,

1783
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:41,520
what people are doing with innovation,
with technology at all seems to be a 

1784
01:36:41,811 --> 01:36:44,810
connection between humans and 
technology.

1785
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:46,550
This symbiotic connection,

1786
01:36:46,630 --> 01:36:51,630
oh,
this is a soul called singularity that 

1787
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:53,911
you hear so much about where are the 
humans and the technological innovations

1788
01:36:54,221 --> 01:36:59,221
are going to combine into a singular 
society or even a singular organism who 

1789
01:37:00,881 --> 01:37:05,881
knows and that might be adaptive.
That might be a direction that humans 

1790
01:37:05,881 --> 01:37:09,361
couldn't go.
And so I think you're on the right 

1791
01:37:09,361 --> 01:37:12,091
track.
I think that this is a very innovative 

1792
01:37:12,091 --> 01:37:14,341
way of thinking,
but let's talk about practicality and 

1793
01:37:14,341 --> 01:37:15,820
the listeners of your show at quite have
to decide,

1794
01:37:15,821 --> 01:37:20,821
okay,
which side of history are you going to 

1795
01:37:20,821 --> 01:37:22,981
be on?
Are you going to be on the side that 

1796
01:37:22,981 --> 01:37:22,981
the,
uh,

1797
01:37:22,981 --> 01:37:27,500
full mount suicide bombing and religious
bigotry or you're going beyond the side,

1798
01:37:27,501 --> 01:37:32,501
the facilitates love and human 
cooperation and care for children and 

1799
01:37:32,501 --> 01:37:33,920
women and men.
Which side is better?

1800
01:37:33,921 --> 01:37:34,370
Strip club,

1801
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:40,600
which side has better strip clubs as the
side of religious

1802
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:47,680
collaboration.
They have the better strip clubs up 

1803
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:49,970
there on the side of beauty there on the
side of love.

1804
01:37:49,971 --> 01:37:50,900
No doubt about it.

1805
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:52,510
Yeah.
That's where you want to leave.

1806
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:57,560
What were you going to say?
I was just gonna say when you're in 

1807
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:57,560
your,
your point,

1808
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:57,560
they're talking

1809
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:58,960
about how to what extent this is natural
human behavior.

1810
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:02,460
Keep in mind that anatomically modern 
human beings are.

1811
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:05,560
Most scientists would say about 200,000
years on the planet.

1812
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:10,590
Right?
And until very until the last couple of 

1813
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:11,140
hundred or a thousand,
depending on how you want to look at it.

1814
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:15,040
They were living the same way forever 
and you know,

1815
01:38:15,041 --> 01:38:20,041
like 40,000
years you'd get boeing arrow instead of 

1816
01:38:20,041 --> 01:38:20,050
spheres,
you know,

1817
01:38:20,051 --> 01:38:22,420
that would be the one technological 
advance,

1818
01:38:22,421 --> 01:38:22,900
you know,
and,

1819
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,660
and so there's been a lot of debate like
what happened,

1820
01:38:25,661 --> 01:38:29,890
why wasn't there more movement and 
progress and all this stuff.

1821
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:34,180
And at the moment the best theory I know
of is that people were comfortable.

1822
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:37,510
There wAsn't any need necessity.
The mother of invention.

1823
01:38:37,511 --> 01:38:42,511
Right?
So like there's plenty of food around 

1824
01:38:42,511 --> 01:38:42,511
blending.
You look at,

1825
01:38:42,511 --> 01:38:45,600
you know,
how many hours hunter gatherer people 

1826
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:46,000
spend working compared to us.
They work a lot less than we do.

1827
01:38:46,690 --> 01:38:48,010
So,
you know,

1828
01:38:48,011 --> 01:38:50,220
I,
I see your point and I agree with,

1829
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:52,030
with what you're saying and the 
singularity,

1830
01:38:52,031 --> 01:38:53,860
I think we're definitely going in that 
direction,

1831
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:57,490
but to say that it's a natural human 
behavior,

1832
01:38:57,491 --> 01:39:02,491
we have to keep in mind that it's been a
quantum shift in the very last seconds 

1833
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:04,090
of human existence.

1834
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:07,460
Isn't that sort of like almost like the 
rosetta stone.

1835
01:39:07,461 --> 01:39:12,461
Like we figured out how to make metal 
and then we figured out how to conduct 

1836
01:39:12,461 --> 01:39:13,490
electricity and then we're off to the 
races and we just like,

1837
01:39:13,491 --> 01:39:18,491
we put a couple of things together,
the key pieces in the language of 

1838
01:39:18,491 --> 01:39:19,180
technology and that set off this,

1839
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:21,170
but there's intentionality there.
You're,

1840
01:39:21,171 --> 01:39:25,040
you're attributing.
Whereas I think it's a happenstance.

1841
01:39:25,041 --> 01:39:30,041
I think it's a question of a population 
densiTy that we didn't ever choose.

1842
01:39:30,531 --> 01:39:32,420
That's a quick.
I get the question all the time,

1843
01:39:32,421 --> 01:39:34,910
like if agriculture sucks so bad,
why did we do it?

1844
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,490
As if we,
you know,

1845
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,520
some guys were like,
hey,

1846
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:39,460
why don't we start farming,
you know,

1847
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:40,880
they wiLl,
will make a deal.

1848
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,760
It happens.
I'm reminded of this guy.

1849
01:39:43,761 --> 01:39:48,761
This happened.
You might have known about this in 

1850
01:39:48,761 --> 01:39:48,761
sonoma.
There were some,

1851
01:39:48,761 --> 01:39:49,910
uh,
there at a winery and um,

1852
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:55,240
there's some tourIsts,
they're getting ready to take balloon 

1853
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:55,580
rides over the winery and they were 
setting up one of the balloons,

1854
01:39:55,581 --> 01:40:00,581
hot air balloons and,
and it started to pull away and the 

1855
01:40:00,581 --> 01:40:01,550
balloon guys were having trouble 
managing it.

1856
01:40:01,551 --> 01:40:05,540
And a german tourist who was standing 
there ran over to help them and grab the

1857
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:09,290
basket of the balloon and then the 
balloon took off.

1858
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:14,750
It broke free.
And if you're a professional working 

1859
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:17,561
with balloons,
you never let both your feet off the 

1860
01:40:17,561 --> 01:40:18,080
ground.
That's like the rule.

1861
01:40:18,081 --> 01:40:20,840
If you're working with balloons once,
both feet leave the ground,

1862
01:40:20,841 --> 01:40:22,490
you let go.
This guy didn't know that.

1863
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:26,420
So what happened?
He went up,

1864
01:40:26,421 --> 01:40:28,310
he hung on as long as he could.
Then he fell.

1865
01:40:29,450 --> 01:40:34,450
All his friends watching,
he couldn't pull himself up in the 

1866
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:34,450
parking lot.
Oh fuck.

1867
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:36,890
Can't fight mother nature.
You can't fight gravity,

1868
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:42,430
so that's,
that's how I see at the advent of 

1869
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:42,430
agriculture is like,
you know,

1870
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:45,140
it made sense at the time and then you 
get tied into the loop.

1871
01:40:45,141 --> 01:40:46,280
You can't get out,
but

1872
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:51,280
isn't that sort of the same pattern of 
complexity?

1873
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:54,390
It's we,
we figure

1874
01:40:54,390 --> 01:40:59,390
out one thing that integrates us more 
deeply wIth each other and then from 

1875
01:40:59,390 --> 01:41:03,581
there that innovation leads to more 
innovations which lead to bigger 

1876
01:41:03,581 --> 01:41:05,270
buildings which lead to,
you know,

1877
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:11,470
different irrigation methods which lead 
to larger supplies of food which leads 

1878
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:15,821
to more people,
which leads to more innovation because 

1879
01:41:15,821 --> 01:41:15,821
there's more people which leads to 
communication issues,

1880
01:41:15,821 --> 01:41:18,920
which leads to the invention of phones,
which I mean it's,

1881
01:41:18,921 --> 01:41:20,870
it's this constant technological 
progression.

1882
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:23,100
Yes,
technical logical progression,

1883
01:41:23,101 --> 01:41:26,630
but along with that comes pollution 
comes.

1884
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:30,150
Desertification comes global warming.
That's the dark side,

1885
01:41:30,230 --> 01:41:35,230
but is that necessary?
Is that not more of the yin and yang 

1886
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:39,800
like the the solution needs to be 
acquired,

1887
01:41:39,801 --> 01:41:44,801
like someone needs to figure out a way 
to have a sustainable sort of an urban 

1888
01:41:44,801 --> 01:41:49,241
environment like instead of this idea 
where we're constantly burning fossil 

1889
01:41:49,241 --> 01:41:49,970
fuels,
there's other ways to extract energy.

1890
01:41:49,971 --> 01:41:50,820
Why do not?
Why?

1891
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:52,690
Why don't we have solar cities?
We don't have.

1892
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:54,680
Why don't?
Why isn't los angeles solar city?

1893
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:56,750
You want to talk about the dumbest 
fucking thing ever.

1894
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:59,950
Fly over downtown la.
Everybody's operating on coal,

1895
01:41:59,951 --> 01:42:03,020
power to electricity and this fucking 
sunlight everywhere.

1896
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:07,190
Three hundred and 60 days a year.
it it rains for days a year out here and

1897
01:42:07,191 --> 01:42:09,500
there's no solar panels anywhere in 
downtown la.

1898
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:14,540
When I was at the university of 
Wisconsin back in the early 19 fifties 

1899
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:18,910
while of our chemistry professors was 
preaching soLar power and nobody 

1900
01:42:20,731 --> 01:42:25,731
believed him,
they thought he waS off the wall anD he 

1901
01:42:25,731 --> 01:42:28,320
even had invented solar panels,
which other people had founded.

1902
01:42:28,321 --> 01:42:33,321
Also,
solar panels and solar power had been 

1903
01:42:33,321 --> 01:42:36,951
with us potentially since the late 
forties or early 19 fifties,

1904
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:42,470
but they were a threat to establishment 
govern reliance on fossil fuels.

1905
01:42:44,930 --> 01:42:47,580
Now,
so only now Are we waking up,

1906
01:42:47,581 --> 01:42:52,581
well,
we'd better go in that direction if 

1907
01:42:52,581 --> 01:42:55,461
we're going to avoid the destruction of 
the earth and most people still don't 

1908
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:58,380
give that high priority,
so the knowledge was there,

1909
01:42:58,381 --> 01:43:00,210
but they were bypassed.
Well,

1910
01:43:00,211 --> 01:43:05,211
like the electric car,
you know what happened to the original 

1911
01:43:05,211 --> 01:43:08,130
car?
It just ran a foul of commercial 

1912
01:43:08,130 --> 01:43:09,450
interests,
so a lot of these innovations that could

1913
01:43:09,451 --> 01:43:14,451
have led to sustainability long time ago
were bypassed and only now,

1914
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:20,120
maybe before it's too late,
can we go back and bring those into 

1915
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:20,120
fruition.

1916
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:25,600
That brings us back to what we were 
talking about earlier with the hemp and 

1917
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,711
the original issue with him being that 
hemp as a commodity where Henry Ford 

1918
01:43:28,711 --> 01:43:30,540
made the first body panels,
have a car.

1919
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:35,560
They were made out of hemp.
His car also ran on hemp fuel and this 

1920
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,180
is the very first cars that Henry Ford 
created,

1921
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:42,510
and that's very little known fact that 
camp in in a fiber form when they turn 

1922
01:43:43,841 --> 01:43:46,900
it into body panels is actually stronger
and Lighter than Steel.

1923
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,140
Oh,
hampers wonDerful.

1924
01:43:48,141 --> 01:43:51,530
George Washington grew hemp by the way,
and no,

1925
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:52,050
you try

1926
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:57,050
to get government subsidies for hamp.
you even tried to get legal permission 

1927
01:43:57,050 --> 01:43:59,790
to grow hemp and you run up against a 
brick wall.

1928
01:43:59,910 --> 01:44:04,910
Well,
we own a part of a supplement company 

1929
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:08,600
and one of the thIngs that we sell is 
hemp protein powder and we have to buy 

1930
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:10,620
it from Canada.
We can't grow it in the United States.

1931
01:44:10,621 --> 01:44:15,621
We have to buy it from Canada and it's 
very popular and we can only get 50 

1932
01:44:15,621 --> 01:44:18,150
pounds a day from these people because 
of the fact that it's so.

1933
01:44:18,151 --> 01:44:22,110
It's so much in demand.
It's really hard to to keep keep up with

1934
01:44:22,111 --> 01:44:27,111
the demand and we.
There's been laws passed and because 

1935
01:44:27,111 --> 01:44:30,510
Colorado and Washington state both 
passed laws legalizing marijuana,

1936
01:44:30,511 --> 01:44:34,350
they also are trying to legalize hemp 
farming,

1937
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:37,140
but even though hemp is non 
psychoactive,

1938
01:44:37,141 --> 01:44:42,141
they're still facing a massive backlash 
from the federal government and people 

1939
01:44:42,141 --> 01:44:43,110
are scared to pull the trigger and start
farming.

1940
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:45,150
Even just hemp,
just just fArming him,

1941
01:44:45,630 --> 01:44:47,310
which is non psychoactive.
Again,

1942
01:44:47,311 --> 01:44:49,710
the cousin of the marijuana plant,
you can't.

1943
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:54,760
You'll go to jail,
they'll lock you up in a cage for 

1944
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:57,141
growing a plant that's perhaps the most 
spectacular plant available to human 

1945
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:58,800
beings on the planet earth today.

1946
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:01,280
Yeah,
it's the plant with the longest,

1947
01:45:01,490 --> 01:45:06,490
a verified cultivation.
It's the first thing humans ever 

1948
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:06,710
cultivated as far as we know.

1949
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:09,900
Isn't that like the best sign that we're
crazy like that?

1950
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:14,910
That's illegal.
I mean it's one of the best signs that 

1951
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:14,910
we've

1952
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:15,210
politically last script.
The rational.

1953
01:45:15,211 --> 01:45:19,770
I mean on top of everything the 
government does is out of money.

1954
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:24,830
I mean,
tours of the white house are being 

1955
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:26,841
curtailed.
A flowers for the tomb of the unknown 

1956
01:45:26,841 --> 01:45:30,930
soldieR are not being placed and because
of these stupid little budget cuts,

1957
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:36,240
why can't we grow hemp and tax it?
Why caN't we grow marijuana and tax it?

1958
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:38,670
Just think of the tax revenues that 
would come in.

1959
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:42,390
You have all the money that wouldn't go 
to the drug warriors.

1960
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:47,650
Is it shocking for you to have lived 
this long and seen us go from the 

1961
01:45:47,650 --> 01:45:50,030
fifties to 2013 and see where we're at 
today?

1962
01:45:50,060 --> 01:45:52,730
Did you think that we'd be much further 
along by now?

1963
01:45:53,210 --> 01:45:58,210
No.
I have always been very much of a 

1964
01:45:58,210 --> 01:46:00,050
realist and I have never been a utopian.
I just sort of take what comes.

1965
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:05,140
I have seen human folly in one form or 
another and I've certainly come to some 

1966
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:10,480
human folly myself,
so I'm just made of course and I'm 

1967
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,980
disappointed,
but I wouldn't say I'm shocked.

1968
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:18,310
If you could address the people of the 
world and urge them to move in one 

1969
01:46:18,310 --> 01:46:18,930
direction or the other.
What what,

1970
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:23,450
what do you think would be the best 
method for change for this world?

1971
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:29,400
Good heavens.
I would never reach that pinnacle of 

1972
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:32,430
publicity or success or egotism,
but what comes to mind most quickly 

1973
01:46:33,221 --> 01:46:36,700
would say,
be a little kinder to each other,

1974
01:46:38,890 --> 01:46:40,300
be a lot kinder to each other.
Right.

1975
01:46:41,350 --> 01:46:46,350
If I were a little more enthusiastic,
I would say it'd be a lot kinder,

1976
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:49,560
less enthusiastic.
What holds you back?

1977
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:55,160
I would go one step at a time.
Starting a liTtle kinder works and 

1978
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:57,810
viola.

1979
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:02,530
Yeah,
and that's a psychedelic state of mind,

1980
01:47:02,531 --> 01:47:03,260
isn't it?
I mean,

1981
01:47:03,261 --> 01:47:05,440
that's a psychedelic ideology.
Yeah.

1982
01:47:05,570 --> 01:47:10,570
I.
that's one thing I've most certainly 

1983
01:47:10,570 --> 01:47:12,661
Learned from my experiences is that 
there's some sort of a strange 

1984
01:47:12,661 --> 01:47:15,880
connection between human beings and when
we exercise that connection to,

1985
01:47:15,881 --> 01:47:18,310
or I should say,
when we respect that connection,

1986
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:23,320
honor that connection.
It enhances the way you feel about life 

1987
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:27,211
and enhancers to being kind to other 
people has a positive effect on you as 

1988
01:47:27,211 --> 01:47:31,951
an individual.
It's like the universe reinforcing that 

1989
01:47:31,951 --> 01:47:31,951
sort of behavior.

1990
01:47:31,951 --> 01:47:35,560
Well,
this really ties together matraville 

1991
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:37,840
talking about,
we're talking about shamanism and our 

1992
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:42,731
book justifying shamans,
shamans help the community be kind to 

1993
01:47:42,731 --> 01:47:46,190
each other,
help the community work together.

1994
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:51,790
Shamans in terms like rolling thunder 
saw the need for communities all over 

1995
01:47:53,181 --> 01:47:58,181
the world who work together.
Politicians haven't quite gotten that 

1996
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:02,600
message yet.
And the psychedelic ethos,

1997
01:48:02,601 --> 01:48:07,601
if you want to call it that,
is one of connectivity is one of 

1998
01:48:07,601 --> 01:48:11,561
kindness.
It's one of seeing the hologram and 

1999
01:48:11,561 --> 01:48:11,750
which we all live.

2000
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:15,170
It's interesting,
the shamans and the,

2001
01:48:15,171 --> 01:48:19,860
the term shamanism,
almost all of it comes from much smaller

2002
01:48:19,861 --> 01:48:21,910
populations.
And uh,

2003
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I think that may be a key to the issue 
is that we went in reaching like New 

2004
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:29,790
York city,
los angeles,

2005
01:48:29,791 --> 01:48:30,110
you,
you,

2006
01:48:30,111 --> 01:48:33,900
these 10 million,
20 million city populations,

2007
01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:39,110
you almost,
there's almost too many people to 

2008
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:42,411
manage.
And the term shaman or the idea of a 

2009
01:48:42,411 --> 01:48:45,471
showman gets very weird when you're in a
tribe of a few hundred people and you 

2010
01:48:45,471 --> 01:48:47,700
have one trusted man that you've known 
your whole life.

2011
01:48:47,701 --> 01:48:49,770
You know his chAracter.
You know what he's really all about.

2012
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:55,040
He's not,
he's not trying to run some jim jones 

2013
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:55,790
bullshit and start his own cult.
But when you,

2014
01:48:55,810 --> 01:48:58,950
when you have a million people and you 
have 10 million people,

2015
01:48:58,951 --> 01:49:03,951
whatever you have,
and you start calling yourself a shaman 

2016
01:49:03,951 --> 01:49:05,820
and you gather up a following and they 
come from all around,

2017
01:49:06,090 --> 01:49:07,530
next thing you know you've got a cult.

2018
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:11,610
This is why you don't cAll yourself a 
shaman.

2019
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:15,870
A community appoints you a shaman.
If you call yourself a shaman,

2020
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:21,140
then you get into the whole cult 
mentality and you know what happens to 

2021
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:25,641
cults?
Usually they get out of hand and they 

2022
01:49:25,641 --> 01:49:27,010
elude to lead to the jim jones 
phenomenon.

2023
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,020
The mass suicide.

2024
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:30,110
Yeah.
Is it possible to avoid that?

2025
01:49:30,111 --> 01:49:35,111
Can you have a nice cold?
Is that something that people never 

2026
01:49:35,111 --> 01:49:35,111
figured out?
Like,

2027
01:49:35,111 --> 01:49:35,210
look,
they didn't even figure out the airplane

2028
01:49:35,211 --> 01:49:36,380
until the 18 hundreds.
Right?

2029
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:39,500
Is it possible to figure out a nice 
colt?

2030
01:49:40,710 --> 01:49:45,710
I don't think you'd call it a cult 
because the word called has taken on a 

2031
01:49:45,710 --> 01:49:47,020
negative connotation.
Right?

2032
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:50,300
But it doesn't have to be.
I think you could have a nice cold.

2033
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:55,480
I'd have to strange biomet,
straighten my imagination to think of 

2034
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:55,480
one.
But,

2035
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:56,920
uh,
I would suppose a.

2036
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:59,570
Theoretically it's possible.
Well,

2037
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:04,620
I caught the quakers were not really a 
cult because they never had a primary 

2038
01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:07,190
leader.

2039
01:50:07,390 --> 01:50:11,860
A so called assumes that personality at 
the center of it.

2040
01:50:11,861 --> 01:50:12,760
Okay.
Does it have to?

2041
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:16,870
Well,
that's the definition of cold focuses on

2042
01:50:16,871 --> 01:50:18,310
a person.
You could.

2043
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:20,170
Well,
I,

2044
01:50:20,171 --> 01:50:25,171
I hear a talk about the grateful dead 
cult now that certainly has been very 

2045
01:50:25,171 --> 01:50:28,370
beneficial during the era that the 
grateful dead were wrong with all of the

2046
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:33,380
deadheads and even though you had some 
people going off the edge at grateful 

2047
01:50:34,281 --> 01:50:37,250
dead concerts,
bottled large was a loving,

2048
01:50:37,550 --> 01:50:39,800
collaborative,
cooperative group.

2049
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:45,280
And the grateful dead singers themselves
certainly didn't preach violence and 

2050
01:50:45,771 --> 01:50:49,460
terrorism.
They preached love and peace and joy and

2051
01:50:49,461 --> 01:50:54,461
happiness.
And you hear in the music that's called 

2052
01:50:54,461 --> 01:50:56,600
a cult.
I would not use that term myself,

2053
01:50:56,930 --> 01:50:58,460
but uh,
that had a,

2054
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:01,460
not one person but a group of people at 
the head of it.

2055
01:51:01,850 --> 01:51:06,850
And when the grateful dead ended,
well you have the memories linger on and

2056
01:51:07,071 --> 01:51:11,330
the members of the great how all doing 
useful and beautiful and artistic things

2057
01:51:11,331 --> 01:51:13,460
on their own.
Burning man.

2058
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:15,370
Yeah.
That sort of thing.

2059
01:51:15,371 --> 01:51:15,820
Have you been to

2060
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:17,500
burning man?
Yes.

2061
01:51:17,630 --> 01:51:18,340
Oh,
you've been there.

2062
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:22,300
I have bounced or something like 
burningham burn burning man.

2063
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:24,280
I've built a,
one of the smaller venues,

2064
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:30,060
but I don't think that you had called 
out a cult because that doesn't focus 

2065
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:32,470
around a Particular person.
I would call that a social movement,

2066
01:51:32,790 --> 01:51:34,180
a social phenomenon.

2067
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:35,950
I,
uh,

2068
01:51:35,970 --> 01:51:39,000
I could get down with the whole grateful
dead thing set the music sucks.

2069
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:41,070
A kiss cam.
Oh,

2070
01:51:41,071 --> 01:51:44,490
that's a matter of taste.
I'm only fucking around,

2071
01:51:45,450 --> 01:51:47,680
but I have a degree

2072
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:49,770
filled.
They'll have their own archive.

2073
01:51:49,771 --> 01:51:52,950
It was not their idea,
but the university of California,

2074
01:51:52,951 --> 01:51:57,951
santa cruz opened up an archive now that
I was there for the ground debut of the,

2075
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:03,480
uh,
of the collection.

2076
01:52:03,481 --> 01:52:08,481
And they're doing a marvelous Job in 
terms of showing the whole chronology of

2077
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:12,360
what they called the grateful dead 
phenomenon.

2078
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:16,860
Add tHat the such a mosaic with knoll 
denier movement at all.

2079
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:22,040
It's a challenge to put that into what's
going to be 24 rooms and they have 

2080
01:52:24,211 --> 01:52:29,211
gotten donations literally from all over
the world and they've arranged it very,

2081
01:52:29,731 --> 01:52:33,060
veRy tastefully.
This is open to the public and there you

2082
01:52:33,061 --> 01:52:37,770
can get a real taste of what a social 
Movement can do,

2083
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:42,830
an artistic movement.
Also the how it can start and what that 

2084
01:52:42,830 --> 01:52:42,830
lead to.

2085
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:43,430
Yeah,
the.

2086
01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:48,450
I think that in that it was a very 
positive movement and the dad sort of 

2087
01:52:48,450 --> 01:52:51,050
emphasized peace and love and that 
everybody would go around.

2088
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:56,170
My cousin actually follow the debt 
around for years and years and her and 

2089
01:52:56,170 --> 01:52:58,460
her boyfriend used to sell eggs and 
bacon from the back of their car.

2090
01:52:58,461 --> 01:53:03,461
They had like a little grill and they 
would cook and the concerts and feed 

2091
01:53:03,461 --> 01:53:07,751
people and make beads and shit and do 
weird crafts and stuff and she was a 

2092
01:53:07,751 --> 01:53:12,011
full on deadhead for several years.
Just followed them from venue to venue 

2093
01:53:12,011 --> 01:53:14,330
and that's a.
I don't know how that happens.

2094
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:17,450
How does a band like that that happens 
for them,

2095
01:53:17,451 --> 01:53:18,920
but it doeSn't happen for the rolling 
stones.

2096
01:53:18,921 --> 01:53:19,990
It happens for,
you know,

2097
01:53:19,991 --> 01:53:21,320
it's,
it's a strange thing.

2098
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:23,620
That's the merry pranksters,
right?

2099
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:27,510
They were the house band for ken keyes.
Ease.

2100
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,020
She had a great deal to do with it.
Right.

2101
01:53:30,030 --> 01:53:35,030
And they used to go around in the bus 
right onwards and uh,

2102
01:53:36,630 --> 01:53:38,580
they would go from town to town and do 
the,

2103
01:53:38,581 --> 01:53:39,480
the,
what they Call it,

2104
01:53:39,481 --> 01:53:44,481
the electric koolaid acid test,
so they would have concerts where they 

2105
01:53:44,481 --> 01:53:49,131
were alsO passing out acid,
so they'd like pull into some town in 

2106
01:53:49,131 --> 01:53:50,670
Nebraska or something,
You know,

2107
01:53:50,671 --> 01:53:53,760
find a big field somewhere and everybody
would come out,

2108
01:53:53,761 --> 01:53:56,400
there'd be acid and the grateful dead 
would play.

2109
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:58,800
So the,
from the very beginning,

2110
01:53:58,801 --> 01:54:01,620
the altered consciousness was part of 
the musical experience.

2111
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:05,160
Wolfe's book,
the electric koolaid acid test is really

2112
01:54:05,161 --> 01:54:10,161
a very good chronology.
And you didn't have other bands who had 

2113
01:54:10,830 --> 01:54:15,830
a key sheet sort of adopt them as a 
vehicle for his own creativity.

2114
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:18,260
Yeah.
Did you ever meet ken keyes?

2115
01:54:18,270 --> 01:54:19,050
Yes,
I did.

2116
01:54:19,710 --> 01:54:24,710
I've met volunteered girl who was the 
significant other of both Kentucky kishi

2117
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:30,920
and of Jerry Garcia monitoring girl was 
there for the debut of the archives.

2118
01:54:31,531 --> 01:54:36,531
And her daughter is the one who on jerry
garcia's dog or cut the ribbon to open 

2119
01:54:36,531 --> 01:54:36,840
the archives.
No,

2120
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:38,640
that's a very important part of the 
history.

2121
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:41,170
Mountain girl was Jerry Garcia.
And ken keyes,

2122
01:54:41,171 --> 01:54:42,750
his girlfriend at the same time?

2123
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:44,310
No.
No.

2124
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:48,030
A space between the two.
There's a little bit of gap.

2125
01:54:48,060 --> 01:54:53,060
Who got her first?
I think that Jerry Garcia was Jerry 

2126
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:58,280
Garcia.
How many shifts have you been to 

2127
01:54:58,280 --> 01:54:58,280
[inaudible]?
I've been to two,

2128
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:00,870
but I'm sure you've been to hundreds of 
grateful dead shows.

2129
01:55:01,030 --> 01:55:02,200
Oh,
not hundreds.

2130
01:55:02,290 --> 01:55:07,290
You got to remember that I had a full 
time job at the time and I had a family 

2131
01:55:07,290 --> 01:55:10,350
to take care of.
I estimate high to at least 50 years.

2132
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:14,220
Wow.
15 grateful dead shows and yet still can

2133
01:55:14,221 --> 01:55:18,920
hold a conversation.
Say folks not propaganda has been

2134
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:23,630
mainly at the shows,
but he was onstage and finally yesterday

2135
01:55:23,631 --> 01:55:26,830
he was telling me,
sitting behind the drum drummers,

2136
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,590
looking out in one concert,
a guy comes,

2137
01:55:29,591 --> 01:55:31,330
sits down next to him.
It's david byrne.

2138
01:55:32,030 --> 01:55:33,340
Whoa.
FIrst day,

2139
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:35,560
first time David Burnett ever been to a 
dead show.

2140
01:55:35,561 --> 01:55:39,640
And you were his guy to educate david 
byrne about the grateful dead so that he

2141
01:55:39,641 --> 01:55:42,610
could have an educated conversation with
them after the show.

2142
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:47,380
Did you ever do any psychedelics with 
dolphins or did you ever experiment with

2143
01:55:47,381 --> 01:55:49,570
that?
Swim with dolphins,

2144
01:55:49,571 --> 01:55:51,700
but I've never done psychedelics with 
dolphins.

2145
01:55:51,710 --> 01:55:56,710
Not not necessarily being with dolphins 
as a high enough experience on 

2146
01:55:56,710 --> 01:55:57,130
themselves.
Did you know john lilly?

2147
01:55:57,640 --> 01:55:59,080
Yes.
I knew him very well.

2148
01:55:59,140 --> 01:55:59,560
Yes.

2149
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:05,220
Yeah.
Lily had some fascinating experiments 

2150
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:06,020
with dolphins and psychedelics acid and 
the tanks.

2151
01:56:06,610 --> 01:56:08,620
Sensory deprivation tanks.
AbsoluTely.

2152
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:11,410
Did you get involved in the tank at all?
Sensory deprivation.

2153
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:16,750
Separate deficit.
I've done sensory deprivation tanks in 

2154
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:19,911
the lots of psychedelics because they 
had experiences good enough in and of 

2155
01:56:19,911 --> 01:56:24,490
itself.
A lot of the experiences that I like in 

2156
01:56:24,490 --> 01:56:27,791
and of themselves and I don't need them 
to be augmented by psychedelics.

2157
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:28,700
Yeah,

2158
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:31,790
I agree with that with the sensory 
deprivation tank,

2159
01:56:31,970 --> 01:56:36,970
but I think it takes a little while to 
get get the hang of yes to relax and 

2160
01:56:36,970 --> 01:56:41,771
learn how to let go in there and really 
find those altered states of 

2161
01:56:41,771 --> 01:56:43,080
consciousness.
I've had several people talk to me.

2162
01:56:43,090 --> 01:56:43,490
I'm like,
oh,

2163
01:56:43,491 --> 01:56:46,400
I tried to tank a couple times that I 
really didn't trip my balls off.

2164
01:56:46,401 --> 01:56:47,030
I'm like,
wow,

2165
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:48,020
okay.
You're not.

2166
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:51,070
Maybe I've described this running.

2167
01:56:52,570 --> 01:56:57,470
I don't to be to town talented here,
but when I enter into these experiences,

2168
01:56:57,820 --> 01:57:01,520
I do it with what chris just called 
intentionality on us.

2169
01:57:01,521 --> 01:57:02,710
Okay,
well,

2170
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:04,910
how am I going to learn from this 
experience?

2171
01:57:06,230 --> 01:57:11,090
What am I going to take away from this 
experience that is beneficial to me,

2172
01:57:11,450 --> 01:57:16,070
my friends and the world at large.
Every time I've taken iowasca,

2173
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:20,690
I've written the what I've learned and I
have gotten a very important lesson from

2174
01:57:20,691 --> 01:57:25,691
each of my town iowasca sessions.
The last session was so powerful.

2175
01:57:25,761 --> 01:57:30,761
I'm still learning from him,
still trying to put louis lessons into 

2176
01:57:30,761 --> 01:57:30,980
practice.
How long ago was that?

2177
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:32,750
That was a year and a half ago.

2178
01:57:33,390 --> 01:57:35,220
Year and a half ago,
and it was so powerful.

2179
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,540
You're still trying to

2180
01:57:36,850 --> 01:57:38,480
absorb it.
Brazil.

2181
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:39,800
Very,
very powerful.

2182
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:43,170
What is the most profound thing you've 
learned from psychedelic experiences

2183
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:47,030
if you had a most?
I.

2184
01:57:47,030 --> 01:57:49,820
I try not to play favorites because I've
learned so much,

2185
01:57:49,821 --> 01:57:54,821
but if you put me on the spot,
I would say that human beings are not a 

2186
01:57:55,861 --> 01:57:59,900
part from nature.
Human beings are part of nature,

2187
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:04,730
and when human being separate themselves
from the rest of nature,

2188
01:58:05,450 --> 01:58:07,580
they run a mock,
they get into trouble,

2189
01:58:08,090 --> 01:58:13,090
so living a natural life with the 
principles of nature of all of our 

2190
01:58:13,701 --> 01:58:18,080
relations is the way,
not only to a happy life,

2191
01:58:18,081 --> 01:58:20,240
but a fulfilling life and the meaningful
life.

2192
01:58:20,650 --> 01:58:22,750
Do you think that our current state of 
ignorance,

2193
01:58:22,751 --> 01:58:27,130
when it comes to that,
is just a byproduct of us expanding from

2194
01:58:27,430 --> 01:58:32,430
the world of primitive hominids to 
language,

2195
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:37,860
to explaining feelings and thoughts,
to eventually understanding the full 

2196
01:58:38,171 --> 01:58:40,150
spectrum of our impact in the world.

2197
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:42,100
You've put up very well and I'd like to 
put

2198
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:45,520
that into the context of neuroscience 
and the brain.

2199
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:51,210
We've gotten ourselves into a situation 
where the western consciousness is 

2200
01:58:53,051 --> 01:58:58,051
focused in the frontaL lobeS anD in part
of the left hemisphere of the brain.

2201
01:58:59,230 --> 01:59:03,760
We ignore The reptilian brain,
the medulla oblongata,

2202
01:59:03,770 --> 01:59:07,590
the spinal cord.
we ignore the penalty.

2203
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:12,660
All mammalian brain,
the limbic system where the emotions 

2204
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:12,760
come in.
We've even,

2205
01:59:12,761 --> 01:59:16,480
if you ignore the right hemisphere,
except for lefthanded people,

2206
01:59:16,481 --> 01:59:21,481
the right hemisphere is the holistic 
hemisphere where we see things as a 

2207
01:59:21,481 --> 01:59:22,630
whole.
There's a complete gestalt.

2208
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:27,250
We are focused in the left hemisphere,
which again,

2209
01:59:27,251 --> 01:59:30,940
for everybody,
but the lefthanded people,

2210
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:33,340
we can't leave them out there a little 
bit different.

2211
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:38,740
Focuses on linear thinking,
on bits and parts and pieces,

2212
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:42,480
on reason,
on down,

2213
01:59:43,070 --> 01:59:47,740
on rational approaches to stuff,
and we leave out imagination,

2214
01:59:47,770 --> 01:59:49,600
intuition,
emotion,

2215
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:54,100
all of the things that make a person 
fuLly human.

2216
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:57,040
Yeah.
That'S a very,

2217
01:59:57,041 --> 01:59:58,990
very important point.
You know,

2218
01:59:58,991 --> 01:59:59,650
I,
I,

2219
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:04,660
I think that science is an amazing 
aspect of our worlD and our ability to 

2220
02:00:05,681 --> 02:00:10,681
measure nature and understand the very 
just the building blocks of,

2221
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:16,520
of reality is really amazing stuff.
BuT one of the things that science can 

2222
02:00:17,051 --> 02:00:22,051
account for his love can account for 
appreciation of art can account for the 

2223
02:00:23,501 --> 02:00:25,900
way you feel when a great song comes on.
The radio,

2224
02:00:26,170 --> 02:00:27,950
you know,
can account for the,

2225
02:00:27,990 --> 02:00:28,700
the,
the,

2226
02:00:28,770 --> 02:00:33,770
the beauty of a person's personality.
So certain people that are just amazing 

2227
02:00:33,770 --> 02:00:35,200
to be around that you see them,
you smile.

2228
02:00:35,201 --> 02:00:40,201
It's like there's this immeasurable 
connection to passion and love that that

2229
02:00:40,871 --> 02:00:44,110
human being share that's again to 
measurable,

2230
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:45,760
you know,
you can't quantiFy,

2231
02:00:45,761 --> 02:00:47,070
you can't write it down.
You can't,

2232
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:50,170
and it's one of the most important 
aspects of humanity.

2233
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:55,340
It is.
I'm going to put in a plug for saybrook 

2234
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:58,101
university beCause you are trying to 
expand the boundaries of science and say

2235
02:00:58,410 --> 02:01:03,410
that there can be art based science,
there can be love based science where 

2236
02:01:04,261 --> 02:01:08,280
people can use narratives to describe 
their experience route,

2237
02:01:08,290 --> 02:01:12,120
can use neuroscience to figure out 
what's going on in the brain,

2238
02:01:12,180 --> 02:01:17,180
the gut,
the heart and the body and that's not 

2239
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:20,631
going to completely explain all of this 
because you have to depend upon 

2240
02:01:20,631 --> 02:01:25,290
literature and the arts and poetry and 
painting to do justice to it,

2241
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:30,830
but at least we could do much more than 
we've done in the past with very narrow 

2242
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:32,310
conceptions of science

2243
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:37,650
and in teaching in saybrook university,
you said that the courses were all 

2244
02:01:37,650 --> 02:01:41,551
available online,
so people from anywhere in the world 

2245
02:01:41,551 --> 02:01:41,551
listening to this

2246
02:01:41,551 --> 02:01:45,040
sign.
Of course they have to pay for the 

2247
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:45,040
courses and register with you.
Well,

2248
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:49,061
it depends upon the course.
I would say people can go to our 

2249
02:01:49,061 --> 02:01:49,610
website,
saybrook.edu,

2250
02:01:49,611 --> 02:01:51,680
when they'll get the whole.
How do you spell saybrook?

2251
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:56,030
S a y,
b r o o k saybrook.edu.

2252
02:01:56,090 --> 02:01:58,190
Yes.
And they can find on how much everything

2253
02:01:58,191 --> 02:01:59,260
costs.
They can.

2254
02:01:59,261 --> 02:02:04,261
I handle a course on actually a 
certificate course that anybody can take

2255
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:10,180
on the psychology of dreams and dreaming
repeat after laurel how to work with 

2256
02:02:11,151 --> 02:02:14,420
dreams and learn the brain science 
behind dreams and dreaming.

2257
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:18,000
So there you have both the cycle neuro 
cycle,

2258
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:20,750
neurology of dreams and the neuroscience
of dreams.

2259
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:25,280
But you have the art of dreams,
the interpretation of dreams,

2260
02:02:25,290 --> 02:02:30,290
the dreams make with the rest of the 
body and with the significant people 

2261
02:02:30,290 --> 02:02:32,690
around you.
What about the connection between dreams

2262
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:35,900
and the body's endogenous production of 
how senate,

2263
02:02:36,730 --> 02:02:37,100
like

2264
02:02:37,310 --> 02:02:40,550
dmt,
like rick strassman's work on,

2265
02:02:40,551 --> 02:02:41,050
uh,
on,

2266
02:02:41,110 --> 02:02:42,140
on,
on dmt,

2267
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:43,760
aware of us?
Yes.

2268
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:46,060
Rick strauss would be great.
Another great pie in your,

2269
02:02:46,061 --> 02:02:47,640
you know,
all the important people.

2270
02:02:47,641 --> 02:02:48,750
I'm very,
very impressed.

2271
02:02:48,810 --> 02:02:49,660
Oh,
he's amazing.

2272
02:02:49,661 --> 02:02:51,880
He's a good friend.
I love that guy in his book,

2273
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:54,460
dmt.
The spirit molecule is one in one of the

2274
02:02:54,461 --> 02:02:57,120
most important books I've ever read.
The,

2275
02:02:57,130 --> 02:02:58,210
uh,
the brain.

2276
02:02:58,211 --> 02:02:59,050
Well,
we don't really,

2277
02:02:59,051 --> 02:03:04,051
I mean the law,
everyone likes to say the pineal gland 

2278
02:03:04,051 --> 02:03:04,750
produces dmt and there's some anecdotal 
evidence to that,

2279
02:03:04,751 --> 02:03:07,390
but we know bob just forget about where 
it's produced.

2280
02:03:07,391 --> 02:03:12,391
We know it's made in the body.
We know absolutely it exists in the 

2281
02:03:12,391 --> 02:03:14,230
human boDy aNd thAt it's one of the most
transient substances known demand,

2282
02:03:14,530 --> 02:03:19,210
meaning that when you take dmt in,
especially in a smokable form,

2283
02:03:19,211 --> 02:03:21,910
your body brings you back to baseline 
extremely quickly.

2284
02:03:22,090 --> 02:03:27,090
And one of The weird things about the 
dmt experiences that it has a very 

2285
02:03:27,090 --> 02:03:31,591
similar effect to dream states in that 
they're very vivid immediately after the

2286
02:03:31,601 --> 02:03:36,601
experience,
but then shortly after just like a 

2287
02:03:36,601 --> 02:03:36,601
dream,
you're like,

2288
02:03:36,601 --> 02:03:36,601
god,
what happened?

2289
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:41,350
What was it?
And it's almost in my humble estimation,

2290
02:03:41,351 --> 02:03:43,660
like a protection mechanism,
like your,

2291
02:03:43,661 --> 02:03:45,730
your,
your reality,

2292
02:03:45,810 --> 02:03:48,640
the material world,
knocking on things,

2293
02:03:48,641 --> 02:03:51,280
weighing things.
That reality is,

2294
02:03:52,510 --> 02:03:57,510
it's so hard to combine the two,
the hallucinogenic reality,

2295
02:03:58,091 --> 02:04:01,930
the dmt reality is so bizarre that it's 
almost like the brands like,

2296
02:04:01,931 --> 02:04:02,650
listen,
bitch,

2297
02:04:02,651 --> 02:04:07,651
you can't handle this.
We're just going to erase that shit for 

2298
02:04:07,651 --> 02:04:07,651
you.
You know?

2299
02:04:07,651 --> 02:04:09,010
You know what I mean?
How can you have.

2300
02:04:09,011 --> 02:04:14,011
I mean,
I've had many dmt trips in the most 

2301
02:04:14,011 --> 02:04:17,491
vivid ones.
They're so incredibly powerful right 

2302
02:04:17,491 --> 02:04:20,050
after it happens,
but they're gone within five minutes.

2303
02:04:20,290 --> 02:04:21,820
You have to.
If you don't record it,

2304
02:04:21,821 --> 02:04:25,340
if you don't write it down,
it's like most of the experience somehow

2305
02:04:25,341 --> 02:04:27,180
or another slips out of your fingers.
Well,

2306
02:04:27,181 --> 02:04:27,270
of

2307
02:04:27,270 --> 02:04:32,270
course,
shifting from one type of conscious to 

2308
02:04:32,270 --> 02:04:33,120
suit other type of consciousness is 
difficult.

2309
02:04:33,121 --> 02:04:36,630
You're going to forget what you did.
This is why when people wake up from the

2310
02:04:36,631 --> 02:04:41,631
dream,
if they don't try to found right away 

2311
02:04:41,631 --> 02:04:41,631
there,
we're going to forget it,

2312
02:04:41,631 --> 02:04:42,940
and even though they don't remember the 
entire dream.

2313
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:46,870
One nice thing about dreams.
This involves the whole brain.

2314
02:04:47,350 --> 02:04:51,970
This is why shamanism is so closely 
linked with dreams.

2315
02:04:52,240 --> 02:04:54,910
Shamanism.
The shaman uses the whole brain,

2316
02:04:54,911 --> 02:04:57,400
the shaman through drugs,
through dreams,

2317
02:04:57,401 --> 02:04:59,230
through dancing,
through drumming,

2318
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:04,280
etc.
Uses parts of the brain that other 

2319
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:06,820
people in the community do not use and 
in dreams you've got the emotions,

2320
02:05:06,821 --> 02:05:11,821
you've got the reflexes,
you've got these survival mechanisms and

2321
02:05:11,981 --> 02:05:16,981
you've got the transcendent experiences 
all in one neat little package and if 

2322
02:05:17,381 --> 02:05:20,950
you don't write that stuff down and put 
it to use,

2323
02:05:21,370 --> 02:05:22,240
you're going to forget it.

2324
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:27,400
I do that all the time.
I've been in bed and I have this 

2325
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:27,400
hilarious idea and like,
oh,

2326
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:32,331
I'm not going to forget that one.
And I wake up in the morning and justin 

2327
02:05:32,331 --> 02:05:34,970
bieber.
What about justin bieber all the time,

2328
02:05:34,971 --> 02:05:36,470
right?
It drives me nuts.

2329
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:42,830
Since the nineties I've been carrying 
these little recorders,

2330
02:05:42,831 --> 02:05:45,230
these digital voice recorders because of
that.

2331
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:50,250
Yeah,
and that's been the bed every night 

2332
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:50,250
under my pilloW sometimes because you 
just hit the button.

2333
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:51,640
You don't even have to wake up.
Yeah,

2334
02:05:52,060 --> 02:05:57,060
I'm going to have to start doing that 
because I record everything on my 

2335
02:05:57,060 --> 02:05:57,060
iphone,
but then you got to open the iphone.

2336
02:05:57,060 --> 02:06:01,100
Going to apps and the digital recording 
these things.

2337
02:06:01,101 --> 02:06:04,580
Some of them you just plug it into the 
computer and it transfers it into text,

2338
02:06:04,581 --> 02:06:05,010
right?
Yeah.

2339
02:06:05,150 --> 02:06:07,610
So yeah,
transfers it into text so you don't have

2340
02:06:07,611 --> 02:06:09,650
to listen and decide.
That's a good one.

2341
02:06:09,651 --> 02:06:11,210
That's a bad way.
You just get a list.

2342
02:06:11,211 --> 02:06:12,800
Yeah,
that's a new thing.

2343
02:06:12,801 --> 02:06:14,270
I didn't know that.
That's good.

2344
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:16,850
Oh wow.
That's a beautiful thing.

2345
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:17,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

2346
02:06:17,930 --> 02:06:21,080
Have you seen any of that?
A voice to text software?

2347
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:23,730
I've seen that a lot.
I'd like to put it to use.

2348
02:06:23,731 --> 02:06:25,110
I think it's a great advance.

2349
02:06:25,180 --> 02:06:27,380
Want to see something called watch.
I'll show it to you right now.

2350
02:06:28,090 --> 02:06:32,090
This is how amazing these things are.
This is just a regular iphone.

2351
02:06:32,210 --> 02:06:37,210
When you go into the notes application,
when you go into the notes application 

2352
02:06:37,210 --> 02:06:38,120
and you want to make a note to get this 
little thing right here,

2353
02:06:38,121 --> 02:06:41,750
that looks like a microphone.
When you press that and you go,

2354
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:46,960
stanley kripner is a bad motherfucker,
and then he'd be like that a butchered.

2355
02:06:48,951 --> 02:06:53,951
You said stanley crypt.
There is a bad motherfucker.

2356
02:06:55,610 --> 02:06:56,690
And then.
oh,

2357
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:59,500
because I said,
oh yeah,

2358
02:07:00,290 --> 02:07:03,380
well I trained it and trained it from 
motherfucker,

2359
02:07:03,470 --> 02:07:06,170
but that's pretty good,
so I bet you would do it again.

2360
02:07:06,850 --> 02:07:09,890
Dr.
Christopher Ryan is a bad motherfucker.

2361
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:13,010
There you go.
Dr.

2362
02:07:13,010 --> 02:07:14,390
Christopher Ryan is a bad motherfucker.
Perfect.

2363
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:19,040
I have proof.
Proof is there in the notes.

2364
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:24,650
Yeah.
That must be an amazing thing to have 

2365
02:07:24,650 --> 02:07:27,100
witnessed,
to see people going from textbooks to 

2366
02:07:27,100 --> 02:07:29,891
the internet to and to be able to hold a
studies and to hold classes online.

2367
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:35,040
That's true.
This is why should you?

2368
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:38,290
Morning star and I worked so well 
together on their book,

2369
02:07:38,291 --> 02:07:41,190
the voice of rolling thunder because he 
wants to round with his ipod,

2370
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:44,320
interviewing people and he has his own 
website,

2371
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:49,780
open source religion,
which you're williston should plug into 

2372
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:54,230
where people from different religious 
persuasions can come to a website and 

2373
02:07:54,230 --> 02:07:59,130
argue things out and discuss things on 
the internet without even meeting each 

2374
02:07:59,130 --> 02:07:59,260
other physically.

2375
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:03,060
Some people from various ideologies can 
compare noTes as to who's crazier.

2376
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:09,170
That's a kind way of putting it.
When you see like in them,

2377
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:14,480
after all you've been through it.
When you see the shit that's going down 

2378
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:14,480
with this,
well,

2379
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:14,480
we have a new pope.
Oh,

2380
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:17,460
and everybody lines up and all the major
media and the news,

2381
02:08:17,580 --> 02:08:21,960
they treat it like it's a real event.
It's really mind boggling.

2382
02:08:21,961 --> 02:08:24,190
You got a guy dressed up like a wizard 
who runs a,

2383
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:28,260
a whole clan of kid fuckers and they're 
taking it seriously.

2384
02:08:28,350 --> 02:08:33,350
How come jerry,
if jerry sandusky had been religiously 

2385
02:08:33,350 --> 02:08:34,040
ordained,
would he not be in prison now?

2386
02:08:34,060 --> 02:08:39,060
They would sneak them around.
They would move him somewhere with that 

2387
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:42,111
guy.
One of the reasons why they had to get 

2388
02:08:42,111 --> 02:08:42,960
rId of the pope for folks who don't know
is that the pope is responsible.

2389
02:08:42,961 --> 02:08:44,400
The past pope,
not the new one.

2390
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:49,400
The past pope was responsible for having
a man released who molested over 200 

2391
02:08:49,770 --> 02:08:52,860
deaf kids.
200.

2392
02:08:53,100 --> 02:08:58,100
He took him.
I'm shielded him from prosecution and 

2393
02:08:58,100 --> 02:08:59,520
then moved to a new parish where he 
molested more kids.

2394
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:01,950
I mean,
it's a huge,

2395
02:09:01,951 --> 02:09:06,951
huge scandal and you're right.
If jerry sandusky hadn't been involved 

2396
02:09:06,951 --> 02:09:11,211
in the religion of football,
but instead was involved in religion of 

2397
02:09:11,211 --> 02:09:12,060
catholicism,
you're very right.

2398
02:09:12,061 --> 02:09:13,770
I bet he would be,
he would be afraid.

2399
02:09:14,070 --> 02:09:16,320
There's a lot of people that are free 
right now.

2400
02:09:16,630 --> 02:09:18,870
Just be shifted to another team.
Yeah.

2401
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:23,960
Well,
one of the things they've done is they 

2402
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:25,960
take people and they,
they say they're punishing them by 

2403
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:26,370
removing them from,
from churches,

2404
02:09:26,371 --> 02:09:29,130
and they bring them to these gigantic 
religious compounds when they have these

2405
02:09:29,131 --> 02:09:32,700
beautiful grounds and his place in North
Carolina where they took this,

2406
02:09:32,701 --> 02:09:37,701
uh,
this guy who was responsible for 

2407
02:09:37,701 --> 02:09:37,701
molesting dozens of kids.

2408
02:09:37,701 --> 02:09:37,701
You know,
it's like they're criminAls.

2409
02:09:37,701 --> 02:09:42,621
These horrible,
horrible criminals and somehow or 

2410
02:09:42,621 --> 02:09:44,631
another we tolerate it.
It's really a weird aspect of our modern

2411
02:09:45,331 --> 02:09:48,060
culture and give them tax rate.
Yeah,

2412
02:09:49,790 --> 02:09:53,580
free free zero taxes if you're in the 
cult.

2413
02:09:54,210 --> 02:09:54,810
I mean,
well,

2414
02:09:55,010 --> 02:09:57,240
do you know Alex Gray?
Well,

2415
02:09:57,241 --> 02:10:00,020
alex grey is a,
he's got his whole chapel.

2416
02:10:00,030 --> 02:10:05,030
That was a brilliant,
brilliant guy and a beautiful human 

2417
02:10:05,030 --> 02:10:05,030
being.
It's just a really loving.

2418
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:10,670
He was so funny we had on the podcast,
anytime I'd say anything negative about 

2419
02:10:10,670 --> 02:10:10,670
anything,
he just like,

2420
02:10:10,670 --> 02:10:11,160
well,
you have to.

2421
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:15,900
He would always find the positive loving
side and not criticizing anyone.

2422
02:10:15,901 --> 02:10:18,300
I'm like a joke and I'm a comedian,
man,

2423
02:10:18,301 --> 02:10:22,440
I don't really mean this.
That's stanley stanley's the same way.

2424
02:10:22,441 --> 02:10:27,441
And so over the years I was standing and
I have known each other 20 years or 

2425
02:10:27,441 --> 02:10:27,441
something and you know,
a lot.

2426
02:10:27,441 --> 02:10:28,760
We talk about sex a lot,
you know,

2427
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:33,840
we spent a lot of time on the road,
he's talking about sex and it sadly to 

2428
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:33,840
say,
oh,

2429
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:34,430
I want to introduce you to so

2430
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:39,430
and so.
She's so beautiful and I'm thinking 

2431
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:39,680
stanley stanley things.
Everyone's beautiful.

2432
02:10:41,930 --> 02:10:43,290
It's a beautiful thing.
Well,

2433
02:10:43,291 --> 02:10:44,870
you take in terms of,
you know,

2434
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:49,900
beautiful in spirit,
but alex great is a wonderful artist,

2435
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:53,240
but one of the reasons he's such a 
wonderful artist,

2436
02:10:53,490 --> 02:10:58,490
he does take a very positive,
optimistic view of people and of life 

2437
02:11:00,111 --> 02:11:05,111
and that shows up in his art and I think
his art is spiritual.

2438
02:11:05,450 --> 02:11:07,370
It's fantastic.
I think he's,

2439
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:12,790
you know,
historically very important and I've 

2440
02:11:12,790 --> 02:11:15,320
been impressed with his art from the 
beginning and his wife,

2441
02:11:15,321 --> 02:11:18,030
his wife is equally talented.
Those wonderful work.

2442
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:18,830
yeah,
she,

2443
02:11:19,240 --> 02:11:21,740
she was with him when he came in into 
the podcast.

2444
02:11:21,910 --> 02:11:25,460
He's a true visionary artists in the 
sense that he,

2445
02:11:25,461 --> 02:11:30,461
in my opinion,
is he has the most accurate 

2446
02:11:30,461 --> 02:11:31,910
representations of the tryptamine world.
Like in painted form.

2447
02:11:32,090 --> 02:11:33,590
Like I,
when I look at his paintings,

2448
02:11:33,591 --> 02:11:37,310
I see like tripping.
I see like there's one of 'em,

2449
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:40,580
it's a gold one.
It looks like to faroe heads,

2450
02:11:40,581 --> 02:11:42,860
like there are facing in opposite 
directions.

2451
02:11:42,861 --> 02:11:47,861
Like I literally,
it seems like something that you would 

2452
02:11:47,861 --> 02:11:48,490
see if you were a,
you were on dmt painting,

2453
02:11:49,010 --> 02:11:50,550
brilliant,
brilliant artist.

2454
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:56,200
He is actually achieved a tax exempt 
status because this chapel,

2455
02:11:58,450 --> 02:11:59,810
the sacred mirrors,
his,

2456
02:11:59,811 --> 02:12:04,811
uh,
his religion is actually being 

2457
02:12:04,811 --> 02:12:04,811
recognized as a true religion.
Wow.

2458
02:12:04,940 --> 02:12:09,940
Yeah.
It's really interesting because he's in 

2459
02:12:09,940 --> 02:12:09,940
sort of a,
like locally,

2460
02:12:09,940 --> 02:12:14,351
they don't want to recognize it.
Like they want the tax money from him 

2461
02:12:14,351 --> 02:12:14,351
and he's like,
well listen though,

2462
02:12:14,351 --> 02:12:18,510
I'm a religion,
like I am tax exempt and if the 

2463
02:12:18,510 --> 02:12:19,690
methodists are tax exempt and the 
catholics at tasks,

2464
02:12:19,790 --> 02:12:21,350
why,
why not the chapel,

2465
02:12:21,351 --> 02:12:22,010
the sacred marriage.

2466
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:27,310
And you know,
he's like sort of duking it out with 

2467
02:12:27,310 --> 02:12:28,160
these people in his area because they 
want,

2468
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:31,490
they want the money.
They want to capture that in brooklyn.

2469
02:12:31,730 --> 02:12:32,830
No,
he um,

2470
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:39,220
he had,
he was in manhattan for awhile and then 

2471
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:39,220
he,
uh,

2472
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:42,910
he moved his place to upstate New York 
and he's constructing this incredible 

2473
02:12:42,910 --> 02:12:47,591
compound where the balls and the 
building of it are all his art,

2474
02:12:48,350 --> 02:12:53,350
like his fractal sort of geometric 
artwork is going to be what the entire 

2475
02:12:55,461 --> 02:12:58,660
outside of the building looks like me.
He showed us some of the plans and it's,

2476
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:01,100
it's amazing some of his art right 
there.

2477
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:03,140
It's just amazing,
amazing stuff.

2478
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:04,790
And,
and in my opinion,

2479
02:13:05,210 --> 02:13:10,210
the most accurate in terms of capturing 
that,

2480
02:13:10,290 --> 02:13:15,290
that those visionary experiences,
those house and hallucinogen based 

2481
02:13:15,290 --> 02:13:17,300
experiences,
he's the most accurate in doing that.

2482
02:13:17,430 --> 02:13:20,420
He did a poRtrait of my dear friend 
Albert Hoffman.

2483
02:13:20,430 --> 02:13:25,430
Yes.
That the love the style on the cover of 

2484
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:25,870
a new biography of off.

2485
02:13:26,070 --> 02:13:27,600
Yes.
I love that picture.

2486
02:13:27,690 --> 02:13:32,690
You know,
brian and see if he could pull up that 

2487
02:13:32,690 --> 02:13:32,690
picture of Albert Hoffman that he did.
That's a,

2488
02:13:32,690 --> 02:13:32,690
that's a brilliant

2489
02:13:32,690 --> 02:13:33,570
picture.
Albert hoffman,

2490
02:13:33,571 --> 02:13:36,650
the guy who first isolated lsd.
Um,

2491
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:38,970
yeah.
The guys like Alex Gray.

2492
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:44,090
You see that vision,
you see that artwork and he makes you 

2493
02:13:44,090 --> 02:13:44,960
want to try those drugs.
Like he,

2494
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:46,560
he makes you want to like,
man,

2495
02:13:46,561 --> 02:13:48,810
I want to see that.
You know what the father's.

2496
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:50,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

2497
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:52,530
That's an amazing,
amazing pictures.

2498
02:13:52,610 --> 02:13:55,230
Shamanically a representation of him 
too.

2499
02:13:55,350 --> 02:14:00,350
Absolutely.
And as long as albert doesn't call 

2500
02:14:00,350 --> 02:14:00,350
himself a shaman or.
Okay.

2501
02:14:00,350 --> 02:14:00,390
Right.
He's got one of obama,

2502
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:04,320
so that's just ridiculous.
Alex needs to go read about drones.

2503
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:09,600
So alex's Wife wasn't pulling a yoko on 
you.

2504
02:14:09,601 --> 02:14:10,740
That's good to know.
No,

2505
02:14:10,741 --> 02:14:13,900
she sat down during the whole thing.
she let him talk the entire time.

2506
02:14:13,910 --> 02:14:14,940
Scream.
Why does she,

2507
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:16,470
uh,
she yoko occasionally.

2508
02:14:17,210 --> 02:14:19,460
No,
I just can't get that thing out.

2509
02:14:21,330 --> 02:14:22,200
Yeah.
Well,

2510
02:14:22,201 --> 02:14:26,700
I always said negative opinion of yoko 
or at least not a positive one,

2511
02:14:26,850 --> 02:14:29,940
but that one just made me howl.
That's so great.

2512
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:32,310
Well listen,
stanley,

2513
02:14:32,311 --> 02:14:37,311
thank you very much for joining us.
This has been a really fun time and I 

2514
02:14:37,311 --> 02:14:40,671
really enjoyed it.
It was a real honor to get to sit down 

2515
02:14:40,671 --> 02:14:40,671
and talk to you.

2516
02:14:40,671 --> 02:14:42,000
Sure.
I learned a lot from our discussion.

2517
02:14:42,001 --> 02:14:43,050
I learned a lot from you.

2518
02:14:43,270 --> 02:14:46,030
Is there anything you'd like to say to 
the young folks out there,

2519
02:14:46,031 --> 02:14:49,810
the people that are in charge of moving 
this thing to the next era,

2520
02:14:49,870 --> 02:14:50,910
if you will,
you're.

2521
02:14:50,911 --> 02:14:53,650
You're getting to talk to more than a 
million people right now.

2522
02:14:53,680 --> 02:14:54,190
What would you say that.

2523
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:56,660
No,
we've been talking a lot about about,

2524
02:14:57,030 --> 02:15:02,030
about psychedelics,
and I'd like to remind people that 

2525
02:15:02,030 --> 02:15:04,920
that's only one way to gain wisdom 
that's not necessary.

2526
02:15:05,370 --> 02:15:10,370
You can do just about the same thing by 
immersing yourself in nature,

2527
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:14,370
by having a loving relationship with 
somebody,

2528
02:15:14,850 --> 02:15:19,110
by meditating,
by praying,

2529
02:15:19,380 --> 02:15:22,260
by immersing yourself in great 
literature and great art.

2530
02:15:22,710 --> 02:15:26,610
Psychedelics are important.
They were important in human evolution,

2531
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:32,030
but there's no one way.
There's no one road that's best for 

2532
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:32,850
everybody.

2533
02:15:33,540 --> 02:15:35,430
Yoga,
meditation,

2534
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:38,740
transcendental meditation,
sensory deprivation tank use.

2535
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:43,780
There's a lot of different methods to 
sort of reset yourself and get an 

2536
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:48,261
objective look at the surroundings where
you're not caught up in the momentum of 

2537
02:15:48,261 --> 02:15:48,261
your.

2538
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:53,320
Exactly.
The important thing is to do this with 

2539
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:53,320
intentionality,
to know where you're going in,

2540
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:55,190
to do it in a disciplined way and learn 
something from it,

2541
02:15:55,490 --> 02:16:00,490
and one of the coolest things about this
life is that we get to meet and talk to 

2542
02:16:02,841 --> 02:16:07,841
people that have lived longer and then 
have had more experiences and it's 

2543
02:16:07,841 --> 02:16:12,161
beautiful that a person like you is 
willing to share those experiences and 

2544
02:16:12,161 --> 02:16:15,191
come on a show like this and express 
yourself and give us the wisdom of your 

2545
02:16:15,590 --> 02:16:17,600
years and give us the insight of all 
your,

2546
02:16:17,630 --> 02:16:19,910
your,
your contemplations on this world.

2547
02:16:19,970 --> 02:16:20,930
I really appreciate it,
man.

2548
02:16:21,620 --> 02:16:26,620
Very kind of you and very kind of you to
say nice things about the voice of 

2549
02:16:26,620 --> 02:16:29,360
rolling thunder and justifying shamans

2550
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:34,060
or you can get these books.
Are they're available on amazon?

2551
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:37,210
Are they available on audible.com?
No,

2552
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:38,450
no,

2553
02:16:38,710 --> 02:16:43,710
Okay.

2555
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:46,000

He'd be the perfect guy.

2556
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:52,550
Do you know dunkin?
I know of him,

2557
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:54,220
yeah.
Would you like to.

2558
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:57,010
If we come to san francisco,
would you do a podcast with dan?

2559

2564
02:17:12,420 --> 02:17:12,580
awesome dude.
And your book's amazing.

2565
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:16,930
So demystifying shamans in their world.
That is one book,

2566
02:17:17,310 --> 02:17:19,990
the voice of rolling thunder.
That is another book.

2567
02:17:19,991 --> 02:17:21,700
How many books you have out.
You have a gang of books.

2594
02:18:33,921 --> 02:18:38,921
People keep asking me if any of the a 
chimpanzee kettlebells are still 

2595
02:18:38,921 --> 02:18:42,641
available.
We only were able to make a thousand of 

2596
02:18:42,641 --> 02:18:42,641
them.
People like,

2597
02:18:42,641 --> 02:18:46,091
well,
is it limited to people with their 

2598
02:18:46,091 --> 02:18:46,091
money?
Everyone.

2599
02:18:46,091 --> 02:18:46,091
So negative.
Listen folks,

2600
02:18:46,091 --> 02:18:47,840
it's a piece of art.
These kettlebells,

2601
02:18:47,900 --> 02:18:49,640
it's hard.
We had to create a mold.

2602
02:18:49,641 --> 02:18:54,641
We had a hire an artist.
We had to get this turned into this 

2603
02:18:54,641 --> 02:18:58,781
functional piece of exercise equipment 
and it's not that easy to do so we can 

2604
02:18:58,781 --> 02:19:00,440
only get a thousand made in our first 
order.

2605
02:19:00,560 --> 02:19:05,560
We're not trying to hold you back.
We want to sell as many of them as 

2606
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:05,560
possible and yes,
we have more common.

2607
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:07,810
We've got a gorilla common.
We've got a the zombies.

2608
02:19:07,820 --> 02:19:10,370
We got some crazy shit headed.
I don't want to tell you anymore.

2609
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:11,930
