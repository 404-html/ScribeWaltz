1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,940
People still rock the bond though,

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,890
kind of respect that,

3
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:08,370
you know,

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,750
it's like driving a manual car.

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,310
I never was a bonger.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,211
It's too heavy,

7
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:12,510
man.

8
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,380
I got shit to do,

9
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:13,741
man.

10
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:14,280
I can't.

11
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,500
Oh,

12
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,170
that just fueled down.

13
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,580
I remember the Dab thing,

14
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:17,801
the,

15
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,410
I got friends in Colorado,

16
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,561
California now,

17
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:22,170
the first time I ever did with shit.

18
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,083
Uh,

19
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,110
this is pretty embarrassing story,

20
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:25,944
but my,

21
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,720
I didn't know what it was.

22
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:28,970
You know,

23
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,200
I just pulled it like it was a
big old bomb rip and they're like,

24
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:31,671
everybody's face.

25
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:32,370
She was like,

26
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh,

27
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,321
you know,

28
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:33,601
it was like,

29
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:33,931
I need,

30
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,330
you instantly know you just did
something you shouldn't have.

31
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,070
Oh No.

32
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,740
And uh,

33
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,100
I was like,

34
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,280
ah,

35
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,911
fuck man.

36
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:40,830
So I sat down and looked
at a couple of minutes.

37
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:42,980
I just started getting
really cold and clammy.

38
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:43,291
I was like,

39
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:43,620
Yup,

40
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,520
I'm going to Puke.

41
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,460
So I went over,

42
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:45,781
I was like,

43
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:46,680
I'm fucked this guy.

44
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,880
So a puke rightness sink.

45
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,111
I was like,

46
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:49,291
dude,

47
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,041
I got to go home.

48
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,390
I feel like dog shit now.

49
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:52,560
And I'm pretty sure I'm dying.

50
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,870
So I had he,

51
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,520
we lived in this apartment and I was like,

52
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:59,470
we're out the door and turned the
corner to go down the hallway to my,

53
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:00,780
and it was full on vertigo,

54
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:01,321
like the hall.

55
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:02,430
Every time I took a step,

56
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,930
the hall we got twice as long.

57
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,950
That was like,

58
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:05,940
this is fucked up.

59
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,280
My wife was out of the country and
work at the time and I was like,

60
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,840
I remember was sitting down in the
hallway just like trying to get my shit

61
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:13,231
together,

62
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:13,501
man.

63
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:13,940
Cause I was so,

64
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,450
I thought I was having
a fucking heart attack.

65
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:16,160
It was just like pat,

66
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,120
like sweating.

67
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,980
And I remember this voice saying,

68
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,870
get up you stupid junkie.

69
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:24,360
Fuck before somebody comes
out here and sees you,

70
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,621
you know,

71
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:27,540
sitting in the hallway like a dumb ass.

72
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:31,110
And I managed to like pop out of it and
as soon as I get back to my place and

73
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:32,190
sit down on the couch,

74
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,330
everything was fine.

75
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:34,801
I don't,

76
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,450
nobody needs to be that stone

77
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,970
that fast.

78
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm sorry.
