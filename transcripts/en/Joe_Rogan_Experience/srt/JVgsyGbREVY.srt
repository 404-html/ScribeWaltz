1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,040
Three,
two,

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,290
one,
boom.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,760
He got appreciate a person who shows up
with not just food but booze.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,140
You showed up.
He brought whiskey and fish.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,760
That's very impressive.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,730
That's why it's exactly what my mom
taught me.

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,690
Your mother taught you to bring food and
booze everywhere.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,360
Exactly.
Well,

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,750
you got a good mom,
but.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,850
So your name is you.
You would introduce yourself as

11
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:35,480
Valentine,
but your mom calls you Valentyn.

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,120
It's what I wanted to choose myself to.
English speaking.

13
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:41,150
People say I'm Valentine.
Right?

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,760
But then when I speak to somebody that
speaks French,

15
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:45,790
I say violence in

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,170
volunteer.
Oh,

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,890
okay.
Because you're from Montreal.

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,360
Yes,
exactly.

19
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,410
Okay,
so I found out about you online and I've

20
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,950
read your story and it's a very
interesting story because you.

21
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,650
You were a lawyer,
right?

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,690
Yes.
I used to be low and I did my law degree

23
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:08,691
in Montreal and then I did my master in
law to before moving to London.

24
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,100
And now you are a spear Fisher.
Yes.

25
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,690
Full time.
It's kind of crazy.

26
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,850
That's a.
that's an interesting transition.

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,430
I.
I'm fascinated by spear phishing.

28
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,960
It seems like a lot of fun.
It seems very exciting and dangerous and

29
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:27,680
risky,
but how did you go from being a lawyer?

30
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,960
And that's a big jump.
I mean,

31
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:31,760
you gotta you gotta pay for an
education.

32
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:32,960
You had to.
Well in Canada.

33
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:34,490
Do you have to pay for that?
How does that work?

34
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,171
Um,
it's,

35
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:37,440
it's Kinda cheap compared to the US
differently.

36
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,520
It's about something maybe like three,
$4,000 a year.

37
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:44,580
So competent us is almost free I guess.

38
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,760
Oh,
that's not bad.

39
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:46,750
Three,
4,000 a year,

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,651
but still,
that's three,

41
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:50,980
4,000 a year for many years that you
decided.

42
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,180
Yeah,
I'll just rather.

43
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,690
My mom definitely didn't get a good
return on investment.

44
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,840
No.
How do they feel about you doing this?

45
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,200
Um,
she still sends me university

46
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,670
applications.
Time to time,

47
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:06,260
being like,
hey,

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,780
when I used to do something different or
something,

49
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:09,650
and I'm like,
no,

50
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,030
I'm not having a midlife crisis.
I just don't like what it was doing.

51
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,800
So I just picked something else.
Oh,

52
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,180
by the way,
I'm going to have to apologize for my

53
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:19,850
English.
Seems perfect for Montreal.

54
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:21,260
So French is my first language.

55
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,900
Well listen,
you're way better than George St Pierre

56
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,950
who was here a couple of weeks ago and
George is more hard to understand and he

57
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:28,570
was fine.

58
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,160
Yeah.
That I'm not going to speak like this

59
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,990
and make enough wealth to.

60
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,060
Well listen,
I'm impressing anybody.

61
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:37,940
You can speak more than one language.
I was just in Thailand.

62
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:40,340
It's just amazing that they speak
English so perfectly,

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,820
you know,
and then their languages.

64
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,110
So oddly different than ours.
Um,

65
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,900
you decided when to do this,
like how,

66
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,140
how deep into your,
your law career were you?

67
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,750
It was about,
I actually made a career switch when I

68
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:57,900
moved to London in 2010,
so I started working in finance.

69
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:02,710
So I work for hedge funds and I
basically decided on a quitting law.

70
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,040
I didn't like the part of law at where I
was stuck in one place.

71
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,600
So you know,
when you,

72
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,460
when you study law see in Canada than
you.

73
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,670
Even in Canada it's even worse because I
was studying in Quebec,

74
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:16,780
which is civil law and then I was stuck
in Quebec for rest of my life and I just

75
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,614
got like,
Ooh,

76
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,873
that's not gonna happen.

77
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
So meaning that.
Okay.

78
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:23,000
So like if you pass the bar in
California,

79
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,270
you would also have to pass the bar in
New York if you wanted to work in New

80
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,810
York.
Exactly.

81
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,930
Okay.
That's different than.

82
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:31,850
Is that the same with like if you were a
doctor,

83
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:32,684
would that be the case?

84
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,370
Um,
countrywise I would say statewide

85
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,080
couldn't know.
But state wise it is for law.

86
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,880
Yes it is.
So for you,

87
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:45,020
you would have got stuck in Quebec in
Quebec is a very interesting place

88
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:47,120
because it kind of doesn't want to be a
part of Canada.

89
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,400
True.
We're very different in Canada,

90
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:52,580
but my biggest problem with Quebec is
definitely not a culture.

91
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:56,750
Anything like that is to fight that.
It's an eight month long winter.

92
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,230
It's rough.
My Mom,

93
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,350
I'm not doing what the people are
amazing.

94
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,070
It is.
It's a very European city actually in

95
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:05,450
Canada it's,
it's people.

96
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,930
People are very about food,
about sitting outside.

97
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:09,530
Yeah,

98
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,460
to my friends,
David and Fred from Joe beef in

99
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,080
Montreal.
One of the best restaurants in the

100
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:14,930
world.
Every there.

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,020
Yes.
Woo.

102
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,970
Woo.
That's pretty good.

103
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,910
That's a German place.
So I'm sorry.

104
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:24,340
So you decided you didn't want to be
stuck?

105
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,391
Yeah,
pretty much.

106
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,090
I kind of got like cluster phobic of
being like,

107
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
Ooh,
this is going to be the next 40 years of

108
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,990
my life.
How'd you get into spearfishing?

109
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,640
I'm very weird story.
I was,

110
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,800
I got into spearfishing when I was
living in London,

111
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,600
which still doesn't make much sense.
And then I,

112
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,700
I met,
I met this guy and he was like,

113
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,410
oh,
you have to try spearfishing will be so

114
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:51,590
good at it.
And he asked me to go do a course in

115
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,120
Egypt the freediving.
So I said,

116
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,240
ah right,
I'm going to go to Egypt.

117
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,070
It's very big for food.
I've eaten.

118
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,260
The sea is like very clear and deep and
what is beautiful and it's calm very

119
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,150
often you can swim from shore and you
have very great depth.

120
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:08,150
So it's,
it's really nice with that.

121
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,580
But.
So I did my course.

122
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,580
I when they're literally kicking,
screaming,

123
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:16,340
I didn't want to go.
When I was 14 years old,

124
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:19,910
I almost drowned and a sat of France
with my parents refused to swim in the

125
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:24,530
ocean for about 10 years after that I
break if I couldn't see the bottom and

126
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,260
who was not even interested in going
near the water.

127
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,610
And then I was like,
all right,

128
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,930
I'm going to try this thing and I go
there and I'm like,

129
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:33,321
oh,
okay.

130
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:34,590
It's not too bad.
No,

131
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,740
it's not that bad.
It's actually really cool.

132
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,900
So he said,
okay,

133
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:41,630
well now you know how to freedive in
three months.

134
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:44,870
We're going to this very big spear
fishing trip on ascension island.

135
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,480
Ascension island is literally one of the
biggest,

136
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,630
most elite spearfishing destination in
the world.

137
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,470
You go hunt for big fish.
It's running all over the Atlantic.

138
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,020
It's right between Brazil and Africa.
It's a island divided between the US and

139
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:01,280
the UK.
Oh Wow.

140
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:03,080
I've never heard of it before.
To people live on it.

141
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,120
Yes they do.
They have locals that.

142
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,600
What language do they speak English.
Really?

143
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,360
Yeah.
It's,

144
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,550
it's a very,
very odd place,

145
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:11,384
but it's very pretty

146
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,350
and it's one of the.
There is Jamie nailed it.

147
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,340
Governor up there.
What's the Google maps tells?

148
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,930
How long does it take to get there?
Finishing up in the middle of nowhere.

149
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,060
That's crazy.
In the middle of nowhere,

150
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,970
but wow.
It's between Africa and Brazil.

151
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:25,480
That's fucking.

152
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,370
I don't get there.
We had to go to the military base and

153
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:31,840
the and the UK,
which is about an hour and a half away

154
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:36,220
from London and we have to take care of
burl air force flight there.

155
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,490
I was the only way to get there.
There's no commercial place real as a

156
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:43,330
stopover on the way from the military
base in the UK to the Falklands.

157
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,070
So how does civilian get a rod on a
military flight?

158
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,810
They allow about five civilians per
flight.

159
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,750
Oh Wow.
So how do you book it?

160
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,260
A travel agent or something?
I,

161
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,650
I didn't do the king myself,
but I think it's like through to the

162
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:02,900
airline or something.
Wow.

163
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,720
It was a weird experience.
I was imagining like what I was like

164
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,310
being strapped down and then facing the
other side is actually a commercial

165
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:15,311
flight just because it's bigger guys,
but at the movie Predator now I was

166
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:19,780
really expecting that and then I get
doors opening the bag and there was like

167
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,620
run out

168
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,130
because I have some friends that have
done some gigs overseas and they have

169
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:29,420
had to fly in those kind of plans.
That sounds pretty cool I guess until

170
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:30,440
someone shoots at you.

171
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,120
Yeah,
that would make it a bad day.

172
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,130
That would change things.
So when you were free diving before you

173
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:40,440
went to this elite spear fishing
destination,

174
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,640
how long could you hold your breath?

175
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,620
When I started?
Yeah,

176
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,720
Siro probably like 15,
20 seconds.

177
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:51,590
And so you're going there with 15,
20 seconds where the breath.

178
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,280
I was pretty bad.
I just did my deepest dive on my way.

179
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:57,680
There was something like 15 meters.
Oh Shit.

180
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,420
I'm Canadian.
No,

181
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,010
that's okay.
It's close enough to yard.

182
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:04,280
We understand what that is.
Five meters 45 feet.

183
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,560
So it was something like that.
It wasn't that great.

184
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,240
And I actually remember my first time I
went spearfishing,

185
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,500
I was on a boat and the word was really
bad.

186
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:13,490
It was rocky,
you know,

187
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:17,210
when it sees like black black because
it's raining and I was in the back of

188
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:18,260
the boat,
I was shaking,

189
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:20,390
I was holding my little gun and I was
like,

190
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:25,020
what the fuck am I doing here?
And like one that watching tv right now,

191
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:26,810
like I don't want to be here,
I don't want to be here,

192
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,580
don't want to be here.
And then my friend was like,

193
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,450
come on,
stop being a fucking pussy,

194
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,500
just Japanese boat,
just jump in the water and come.

195
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,193
I'm like,
ah.

196
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,063
I was like,
okay,

197
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,450
I take a deep breath,
I jump in.

198
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,220
And then the water was so dark and so
horrible and sharp just became super

199
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:45,650
claim and there was fish everywhere and
I was like,

200
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,390
wow,
this is actually pretty freaking cool.

201
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,260
And you're doing this again,
free diving.

202
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,840
Worried having no,
no tanks.

203
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,140
Well I take my first job so I'm a little
bit clumsy because I have my gun and I'm

204
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:54,481
like,
oh,

205
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:55,920
I don't really know how to.
How to

206
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,680
five a debt and then I took a shot down
my first fish and they stoned it and my

207
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:02,514
friend was like,
oh,

208
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,170
I could live in a first shot.
And it's haunting terms too.

209
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,590
And Yeah.
And then I,

210
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,840
my friend was like,
well you're not done,

211
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:14,400
you know,
you have to grab the fish,

212
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:16,380
have to drag it all the way to the boat.
And I was like,

213
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,580
all right,
okay.

214
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,230
Have they finished?
I have always in my face.

215
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:21,270
And then like I get.
It was quite a big fish.

216
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:23,190
It was a big,
it was good.

217
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,200
It was a black Jack,
which is not that great to eat black

218
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,123
Jack.
Yeah,

219
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,510
probably something that many people will
eat.

220
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,070
Why wouldn't they eat it?
It's a,

221
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,950
it's edible.
It's not bad.

222
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,280
It's just not one.
It's not a very flaky fish.

223
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,510
I would say.
It's a little tough.

224
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,500
A little tough.

225
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,080
Oh,
so it's just too dense or something?

226
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,220
Yeah,
kind of.

227
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,290
It's their very strong fish,
so.

228
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,440
Whoa,
that's cool.

229
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:52,840
It converge.
That's what it looks like.

230
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,560
A fish to dale was about like,
like 25 pounds.

231
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,080
Oh Wow.
Your instagram is filled with this

232
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,250
stuff,
which is,

233
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,830
um,
I guess one of the ways that I've found

234
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:10,510
you have,
it's hard to remember how I find people

235
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,850
online,
but your instagram is filled with you

236
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:15,400
with all these cool fucking fish and all
these.

237
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,010
I mean,
you look like you're living a life of

238
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:19,930
adventure.
This is one of the reasons why I wanted

239
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:22,030
to talk to you about is that a lion fish
are killed.

240
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
Yes.
That's a lion fish.

241
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:24,610
And you eat those.
They taste.

242
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:27,610
They probably one of the best dating,
tasting fish ever.

243
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,890
Then he realized they're fantastic.

244
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,560
Do you ever get them on them?
Are they commercially available?

245
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,270
Do they or is it

246
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,950
something you can find them at Publix in
Florida.

247
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,070
Oh really?
Which is what I was very surprised

248
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,870
about.
You just have to be really careful when

249
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:42,130
you harvest them,
of course,

250
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:44,560
because if you touch a spine,
it's poisonous,

251
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,680
very poisonous,
but it's just painful.

252
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:51,400
It's not deadly.
Now you can get into a bloodstream

253
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,760
epileptic shock.
Oh,

254
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,690
well good was.
It didn't happen,

255
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:59,580
but normally you just have like if
somebody was Tommy Tommy's like,

256
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,960
you had a hammer in your head
repeatedly.

257
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,900
Oh,
it's like a throbbing pain for about a

258
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,570
day and a half.
Whoa.

259
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,690
So I got bullied in almost.
It's a paint.

260
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,591
It's not,
it's,

261
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:10,630
it's.
You really try to avoid it.

262
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:14,360
All costs.
So what would you compare the meat to

263
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,570
hogfish
so,

264
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:24,571
or maybe a very tiny Chilean sea bass.
Maybe that type of oily flaky.

265
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,560
Did you know what to do?
We talk about this on the podcast.

266
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,140
Chilean sea bass is not really a basket
to cod

267
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,770
torch.
It sounds also endangered.

268
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,940
So good.
Is it endangered?

269
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,470
How's it on every menu?
If it's endangered assholes.

270
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,600
Um,
so you,

271
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,610
you go to this one destination,
you,

272
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:51,230
uh,
you shoot this black Jack.

273
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,800
Were you hooked immediately?
Yes.

274
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,270
Real.

275
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,800
It was not about a spearfishing part.
Actually,

276
00:11:56,801 --> 00:12:01,240
I was still traumatized in the water,
still had panics attacks when I was in

277
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:06,241
the water and um,
but I fell in love the second I arrived

278
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:10,810
to shore and we barbecued a fish on a
beach and I was like,

279
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,290
okay,
this is this.

280
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,124
Just for me,

281
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,340
the same exact thing that happened to me
when I went deer hunting when we,

282
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,490
me and my friend Brian Cowen and Steve
Rinella and Dan dody were cooking this

283
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:25,920
deer meat by a fire.
And I was like,

284
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,310
this is the greatest thing ever.
This is the meat was so fresh because it

285
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,070
was like from an animal that was,
you know,

286
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,480
literally killed hours ago.
And then we're eating it by,

287
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,590
by the fire.
I was like,

288
00:12:34,591 --> 00:12:36,030
this is,
I'm going to do this forever.

289
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,230
This is the greatest thing ever,

290
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,540
right?
It is,

291
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,860
it's you,
you feel,

292
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,860
you feel what I was taught.
People list that,

293
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,870
you know,
when you live in a big city,

294
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,030
like when I've never experienced that
before.

295
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,730
I've never felt that I was part of the
ecosystem whatsoever.

296
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,870
And then all of a sudden I've been
putting myself into water when I'm

297
00:12:57,871 --> 00:13:01,260
surrounded by sharks are big fish or
different things and I'm like,

298
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,480
wow,
we're actually not in top of the food

299
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:06,840
chain at all.
There's a lot of stuff on buffalo's I

300
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:08,220
can kill us.
And it's,

301
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,880
it's,
it's,

302
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,660
it's carrying is humbling.
And I think as a person you have to

303
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,070
experience that.
You have to,

304
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,140
you have to put yourself out of your
conference old to understand that you

305
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:23,380
need to respect what's around you.
You can tell me 10 years ago,

306
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:25,110
Oh,
you have g debt fish because it's bad

307
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:26,070
for drm.
And I'd be like,

308
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:26,340
yeah,
yeah,

309
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,650
sure buddy.
Right?

310
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,950
And then you see an implant,
you're like,

311
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,671
Ooh,
that looks good.

312
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:32,370
Then it's fine and this.
But then when you under water and you

313
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:34,760
see what's going on and you see that a
spot,

314
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,080
you've been diving for five years old,
southern is empty.

315
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,830
Then it makes you understand that,
you know,

316
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,860
we actually have a very strong impact
and it's,

317
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:43,880
it's our job to,
to,

318
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,810
to understand and respect it.
We're where we're at,

319
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,180
where did ecosystem,
which is the one that we're the smartest

320
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:52,980
one.
Sometimes

321
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,340
we're the only ones that are consciously
aware of our actions and the

322
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:57,760
repercussions.
Yes,

323
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,790
of our actions.
What,

324
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,180
when,
when you're first experiencing this,

325
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:08,181
your first time eat and this feeling of
connectedness and freedom and just being

326
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:15,270
a part of the ecosystem,
did you imagine that somehow know that

327
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,130
this could be your life and your job?

328
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,790
Not at all.
I've,

329
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,390
I've,
I've,

330
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,580
I've never been hiking.
I'm not a big fan of.

331
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,800
I've never used to be a big fan of the
outdoors.

332
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,530
I'm,
I've,

333
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,770
I've,
I don't go to the gym,

334
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,390
exercise,
go to the gym,

335
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,970
basically does everything and all of a
sudden I was living in London and the

336
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:37,280
Nice apartment with two dogs and a nice
car and all of a sudden I wasn't

337
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,640
freaking Africa camping at a Bush,
catching,

338
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,570
catching my own food and sharing with
villages that had nothing to eat.

339
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:44,381
And I was like,
okay,

340
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:45,340
well this is,

341
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,040
that happened.
Like how did you go from this one trip?

342
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,280
Um,
I got invited to film a documentary,

343
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,090
food sourcing and I was like,
okay,

344
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,150
I'm going to try it,
and I fell in love with it and the

345
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:59,630
second I went back to London,
I remember sitting in my desk and be

346
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:02,480
like,
there's no way I can do that.

347
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,030
There's no way I can keep doing that for
rest of my life.

348
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,270
And everybody thought I was completely
crazy.

349
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,380
I sold everything I,
I and I just left.

350
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,210
I moved away and I,
I have like maybe two suitcases of stuff

351
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:18,570
for the past three years and

352
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,500
I was reading somewhere where they were
going to do an interview on you and they

353
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:27,060
decided not to.
They are going to feature you in

354
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:32,061
something with a decided not to because
of concerns for the depletion of fish in

355
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:34,380
the ocean.
And I said,

356
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:38,550
that is one of the dumbest fucking thing
I've ever heard because the impact of

357
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:41,760
someone like you,
what you're doing for your own personal

358
00:15:41,761 --> 00:15:44,580
consumption,
taking a fish a day or whatever you're

359
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:48,930
getting for your own personal
consumption is negligible in comparison

360
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:51,210
to all these people that are probably
writing these articles that are going to

361
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:54,590
buy Sushi from commercial fishermen.
They're there.

362
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,870
They're buying fish from the store
that's wrapped in Saran wrap.

363
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,240
They're completely out of touch with
mean your intouch.

364
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,230
You're as in touch as you can get.
But to think that somehow or another

365
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:11,550
you're doing something evil because you
take photos of it and put it on your

366
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,170
instagram.
Who was that one?

367
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,620
You had this amazing photo from a couple
days ago with you.

368
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:20,270
This is big fish.
It was so fresh and you,

369
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,820
you guys were eating pieces of it.
You had cut a chunk of out of out of its

370
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:24,654
tail?

371
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,090
Yes.
That was in Thailand?

372
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,493
Yeah,
paquette.

373
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,393
It was.
Yeah.

374
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,640
Actually,
yeah.

375
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,060
We just went with this friend of ours
with his family and we just went off for

376
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:35,150
the day and we went spearfishing with my
friend.

377
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,070
We caught a fish and and the guy was
super happy.

378
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:40,250
He cut a right on the spot and all the
kids were just speaking on it and it

379
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:42,380
was.
They were so excited.

380
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:45,770
The second year he came,
the second day came that the boat

381
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,350
arrived back to the island.
They just went and grabbed the fish and

382
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:50,240
they were trying to take pictures.
It was super cute.

383
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,010
What,
what was the argument for not.

384
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,560
What was the piece that they were trying
to put you in where they pulled you out

385
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:56,400
of it?
What was that about?

386
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,410
That story is,
it's still so getting me pretty angry.

387
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,970
So basically where I was speaking at a
woman empowerment conference in New York

388
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:10,920
last May and then when I was actually in
Thailand that the woman that is

389
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:13,650
organizing it calls me and she's like,
oh,

390
00:17:13,651 --> 00:17:15,630
look Valentine,
like I need to talk to you about

391
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:16,570
something.
And it's,

392
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,000
you know,
it's a little touchy.

393
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,013
I'm like,
what?

394
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:19,980
She's like,
well,

395
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,650
one of her sponsor said that if you
speak at a conference being on a which

396
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:27,540
will do participation and the
conference,

397
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,090
what was the sponsor and the Wall Street
Journal,

398
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,520
The Wall Street Journal,
and I'm like,

399
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,250
and she said,
yeah,

400
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:40,251
do you feel like that's your lifestyle
isn't aligned with ocean preservation

401
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,640
and that.
And she said some.

402
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,370
She didn't say it directly,
but she said,

403
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,040
and you know me,
don't mind that you

404
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,800
have pictures in a bathing suit.
I'm like,

405
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,480
what do you mean patient in my basics
you.

406
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,000
Sorry.
My Burkini was not clean.

407
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:58,710
Like,
what do you want from me at a beach?

408
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,320
When am I supposed to wear your also
swimming?

409
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,290
I'm swimming.
You're not wearing a bathing suit.

410
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,120
You mean?
It's not like you're in your house

411
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,220
heels.
You know,

412
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,910
being an Insta model,
you're wearing a bathing suit.

413
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,820
There's nothing wrong with that either,
but you're wearing a bathing suit

414
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,560
because you're actually in the water.

415
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,960
Exactly.
I'm not in Mykonos next year.

416
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,020
Fricking pool.
I'm in,

417
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,970
I'm in.
I'm in Africa on a beach when it's like

418
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:23,660
110 degrees,
what am I supposed to went with Dan

419
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,550
Bilzerian
respect.

420
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,550
So,

421
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,190
so I mean,
what did you say to them?

422
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,420
And that's Wall Street Journal that is
so crazy,

423
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,730
you know,
and I get it from their perspective.

424
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,910
It's a bullshit argument,
but from their perspective it's just

425
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,010
about optics.
It's about how it looks.

426
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,520
That's all it is.
And if they go there and people love to

427
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:49,760
get outraged about something,
if they go there and then they go to

428
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,100
your instagram and they find pictures of
you with fish,

429
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,990
they're like,
well this girl is cleaning out the

430
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:56,200
ocean.
All buyers killing home.

431
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,710
Yeah,
I'm very good.

432
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,640
You have to be really good.
I mean,

433
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,270
have you ever seen a commercial fishing
boat?

434
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,520
What they do?
Yes.

435
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,510
Most people have it.
Jamie CV could pull off the horrific

436
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,540
effects of commercial net fishing
because if you find a video,

437
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:19,151
we can watch a clip of the video.
It's crazy when you see the sheer volume

438
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:25,330
of fish that they pull out of the ocean
and when you realize there's countless

439
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:30,731
numbers of these boats and essentially
pretty much unregulated and no one's

440
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:34,070
watching them and they're doing it all
over the world.

441
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:35,780
I mean there's areas where you're not
allowed to fish,

442
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,140
but overall it's nothing like the way we
treat wild mammals or wild birds.

443
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,170
The way we treat wild mammals,
especially in North America,

444
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,830
is they're very closely monitored.
Their numbers,

445
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:52,730
their populations.
We we make sure that unless it's an

446
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:55,610
invasive species like wild pigs,
like here we go,

447
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,400
this is,
this is awful.

448
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,620
They take this gigantic net,
they circle all these fish and then when

449
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:07,060
they're pulling them in,
you get to see the sheer volume so you

450
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,210
as they get close,

451
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,070
but that's.
That's.

452
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,660
That's one of the smoother way to
commercial fish.

453
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,380
Francis ready big and it's two
kilometers wide net.

454
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,700
That is actually,
it's.

455
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,640
It's scraping the bottom completely
destroying evidence during the coral

456
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,730
stocks on each side.

457
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,050
This is actually a fairly mild one and
it looks like they're getting these

458
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:33,510
little tiny fish,
but me,

459
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:36,120
you could find it folks if you wanted to
go and google it online,

460
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,310
but that is the issue too,
right?

461
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:41,130
That these,
these nets go all the way to the bottom

462
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,530
and they destroy anything that they
touch.

463
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,500
Like the whole bottom of the ocean just
gets dragged

464
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,230
in.
All the coral gets destroyed.

465
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,640
It's this extremely destructive,
but it's what?

466
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:54,160
What?
That's how you get Sushi.

467
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,740
There's so much.
The fish industry,

468
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,220
it's not even necessarily how you get to
Sushi.

469
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:03,100
It's how you get Sushi so damn cheap,
but it's.

470
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,830
It's by DOJ.
If we keep doing that is literally going

471
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,390
to be no fish very,
very,

472
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,780
very soon.
But then how do you explain to us and

473
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:13,690
Canada,
you know how to spearfish what and you

474
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:16,180
have to release most of the fish.
You run rail.

475
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,820
There's a lot of stories.
Most of the fishing rod,

476
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:23,821
unreal reel in Kendall,
stryper is try pass and how many?

477
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,490
How many can you get a day striped bass
like one a day or something?

478
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,840
One day spearfishing.
One a day and and the US site Canada,

479
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:34,540
you not even touch anything.
You can't use spear phishing Canada

480
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,430
because the Anglers Association in
Canada,

481
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,600
things that were the evil basically,
but you're evil.

482
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,430
Why?
Because you can actually see what you're

483
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:46,264
catching.
Yeah,

484
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,020
so basically what cheaters,
because we can see the fish and I'm

485
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:53,200
like,
how can you be in your camping chairs on

486
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:55,480
your boat?
Drinking Beers all day.

487
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,420
Telling me that I'm the cheater when I'm
working my ass off.

488
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,250
Diving it like 60 feet to catch my fish,
to bring it back.

489
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:05,770
And I wrecked my life.
I risked my life drowning and was my

490
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:08,170
left would sharks.
I risked my life with all sorts of

491
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:11,860
things that can happen and you telling
me drinking you,

492
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:14,020
but wiser.
You fricking camping chair that I'm the

493
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:15,460
cheater.
I'm sorry,

494
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:16,294
but no.

495
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,210
Well,
people always want to think that

496
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,600
everybody else is doing it wrong.
True.

497
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,930
You know,
vegans,

498
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:23,820
one of the thing,
people that eat meat or doing it wrong,

499
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:25,130
people did eat meat.
One of the things,

500
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,840
vegans are doing it wrong.
People fish off a boat.

501
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,630
Want to think that people's spearfish,
you're doing it wrong,

502
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,670
you think they're probably doing it
wrong?

503
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,060
No,
I have nothing.

504
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:36,980
Again,
catching you on food as long as you

505
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,870
know,
respectful what would do where you do

506
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:41,540
it.
But there was a big scandal in Florida

507
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,330
for the past years with the Brett snap
or by example,

508
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:47,060
and it was about,
um,

509
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,480
like recreational,
recreational fishing.

510
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,410
You allowed a certain amount of red
snapper and the new season closes and

511
00:22:54,411 --> 00:22:57,680
then when the season closes as an
individual,

512
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,700
my license to fish is gone.
And then he gave it away to the

513
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:05,090
commercial fishermen
and I'm like,

514
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,450
whoa.
So basically you telling me that I'm not

515
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:11,510
allowed to catch that fish for a few
months because the population is too

516
00:23:11,511 --> 00:23:14,990
bad,
but then you given my quota to the

517
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:17,390
commercial boats that are catching
hundreds a day.

518
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,140
They like,
yeah.

519
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,440
No,
it doesn't make any sense.

520
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,640
No it doesn't.

521
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,040
But most people are not going to spear
fish.

522
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,320
Most people are going to fish,
so they don't.

523
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,240
You guys don't have a voice.
Right.

524
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,270
In terms of like representative voice,
some comes to creating these laws and

525
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,490
establishing these,
these rules.

526
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,380
There's not that many of you.

527
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,060
Oh,
we're ready.

528
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,350
And the food chain,
we're the.

529
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,680
We're the plankton is,
you know,

530
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:49,290
you had a commercial fishing would very
big lobbyists.

531
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,440
Men,
a lot of money and then you have the

532
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:55,070
anglers uses a little bit.
It's still not super bad because they

533
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:57,490
still have big boats.
Company and equipment is so like if the

534
00:23:57,491 --> 00:23:58,970
market,
which is good enough.

535
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,500
And anyhow,
spivey,

536
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,100
spivey,
Shamans were not a lot in the world's

537
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:06,680
eye.
I couldn't even tell you how many,

538
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:09,200
but we're not 100 million us for
fricking sure.

539
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,670
It's probably less spear fisherman than
there are bow hunters.

540
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:14,990
That's highly

541
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,990
possible I would imagine because it
seems more dangerous and difficult than

542
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:23,510
bowhunting.
Seems like the next level.

543
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,210
It seems like one of the most difficult
things you could do if you want to get

544
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:29,690
your food,
it's because you're going into an alien

545
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:31,280
environment and you're holding your
breath.

546
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,510
True.
But actually the human body,

547
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:36,430
that's the main argument I get from
people.

548
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:37,264
They tell me,
Oh,

549
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,260
I could never do it,
but every year the human body is

550
00:24:41,261 --> 00:24:45,550
actually made to do this,
so there's a thing called the Mammalian

551
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:50,551
dive reflex and this is very present and
aquatic mammals such as dolphins or

552
00:24:51,851 --> 00:24:55,970
sales and things like that,
and the human habit in a very way we

553
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,740
create way,
but we still have it and so when you

554
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:03,990
immerse your face on the water,
your heartbeat is automatically going to

555
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:07,690
slow down,
especially if the water is colder,

556
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,720
so your body's actually getting prepared
to hold his breath to catch food and

557
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:15,000
that's.
That's a new DNA.

558
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,330
Is it preparing to catch food or is it
just preparing to survive

559
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,110
to hold your breath underwater?
What reason?

560
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,940
I mean,
I guess I guess that was a very success

561
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:27,660
of thing to say because it's I'm,
I'm seeing catch food,

562
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:31,420
but I just don't see why a human being
genetically would have to go.

563
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,820
You're aware of the aquatic ape theory.
Now it's a very controversial theory,

564
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:42,140
but the theory is that we evolved
somehow or another.

565
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,120
You know,
dolphins,

566
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,810
apparently,
where at one point in time a land animal

567
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
is that crew,
is that right?

568
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,030
Were Dolphins Atlanta animal at one
point in time?

569
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,380
I don't know if that's true.
I might have made that up,

570
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,920
but the idea was that humans were the
only ape that grew up in close proximity

571
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:10,430
to water to the point where we evolved
in the water dolphins may have remains

572
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:11,270
of legs.
Yeah,

573
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:12,890
okay.
Fossil remains shows.

574
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:17,891
Dolphins and whales were four footed
land animals about 50 million years ago

575
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,600
and share the same common ancestors is
hippos.

576
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:22,190
And Dear,
Whoa,

577
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,110
scientists believed that they later
transitioned to an aquatic lifestyle and

578
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,920
that their hind limbs disappeared.
Okay,

579
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:31,460
so this is fairly recent.
If you think about evolutionary terms

580
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,160
that the dinosaurs were killed 65
million years ago.

581
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:37,100
So inside of that 15 million years
later,

582
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,100
they were walking around,
which is fucking nuts.

583
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:43,740
They were like hippos.
They think so google doc,

584
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,510
whoa.
Look at what they used to look like.

585
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,710
What the fuck,
man?

586
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,890
A Google aquatic ape theory.
Uh,

587
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,310
I don't know enough about this to really
speak on it,

588
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,260
but that has never stopped me in the
past.

589
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,370
But this,
this,

590
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,200
this theory is that the,
one of the reasons why they think humans

591
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:05,700
have so much fat on us when we're babies
is that we float easier and that if you

592
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:07,620
take a human baby,
you chuck them in the water.

593
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,993
Okay.
Well,

594
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,200
how about an actual article and how to
picture this cartoon.

595
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:14,691
Oh,
but it's actually,

596
00:27:14,691 --> 00:27:17,120
it's not,
it's not even just about you hobbies

597
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:19,390
slowing down.
There's a bunch of things that happened

598
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,560
and you like crazy thing.

599
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,220
Babies know how to hold their breath.
They instantly hold their breath when

600
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:26,980
you,
that's like Nirvana album cover a

601
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,900
million directions.

602
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,461
Yes,
that's,

603
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:29,880
that's exactly,
that's what I'm talking about.

604
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:30,360
Reports

605
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,730
that some humans,
notably children under five may also use

606
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:34,710
this reflex to survive.
Prolong submersion.

607
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:39,360
The mammalian dive reflex was developed
in 19 theory was developed in 19

608
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:41,130
sixties.
That explanation for well publicized

609
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:45,480
survival of exceptional submersion times
have some near drowning victims.

610
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,200
But,
um,

611
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,310
see if there's anything like are an
actual article that makes sense on the

612
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:53,200
aquatic ape theory.
There's a new aquatic ape theory from

613
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:54,300
the Smithsonian.
Oh,

614
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:55,940
okay.
Hm.

615
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,690
Okay.
Okay.

616
00:27:57,691 --> 00:28:00,090
The aquatic ape theory now largely
dismissed,

617
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,480
tries to explain the origins of many
humankind,

618
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,690
a unique traits popular as the 19
seventies,

619
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,630
19 eighties by writer Elaine Morgan.
The theory suggests that early hominids

620
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:11,310
lived in water at least part of the
time,

621
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:15,810
the aquatic life aquatic lifestyle
supposedly accounts for hairless bodies,

622
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,810
which made us more streamlined for
swimming and diving are upright,

623
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:22,530
two legged walking,
which made waiting easier and our layers

624
00:28:22,531 --> 00:28:25,740
of subcutaneous fat,
which made us better insulated in water.

625
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,460
Think Whale blubber.
The theory even links and aquatic

626
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:33,510
existence to the extinction of human
evolution rather of human speech.

627
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:38,870
The hypothesis was met with much
criticism Blahblahblahblah blom 2009.

628
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,410
Uh,
Richard Rang Ham of Harvard University

629
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:47,460
and colleagues suggested in American
Journal of physical anthropology that

630
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,200
shallow aquatic habitats allowed
hominids to thrive in Savannah's

631
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,270
enabling our ancestors to move from
tropical forest to open grasslands.

632
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,500
So from two point $5 million to one
point 4 million years ago,

633
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,980
Africa became drier during certain
seasons already dry.

634
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:09,510
Savannah's became even more arid,
making it difficult for hominids to find

635
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:13,230
adequate food.
But randoms team suggests that even in

636
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:17,040
this inhospitable environment,
there were oasises wetlands in lake

637
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:20,050
shores and these aquatic habitats,
water lilies,

638
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:20,571
cattails,
blah,

639
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:20,931
blah,
blah,

640
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:21,741
blah,
blah,

641
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:22,380
blah,
blah.

642
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,550
So that's the theory.
The theory is that we like,

643
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,850
you know,
obviously there's a bunch of different

644
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:30,120
kinds of primates and some of them are
still in trees today.

645
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:32,310
Those fucking losers.
We left them behind.

646
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:34,140
Ha Ha.
Those are the ones that really dumb

647
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:36,110
people point to.
If people came from monkeys wearing

648
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,720
monkeys,
well Tom,

649
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,740
they were the dumb monkeys fro.
Come on,

650
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:47,550
get it together.
We're the ones that made cars but that,

651
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:48,940
um,
some,

652
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,960
some of these apes spent a lot of time
in the water.

653
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,570
And that's why I'm,
if you ever see a baby chimp,

654
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,780
they're hard as rock.
They're like they're jacked baby chimps.

655
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:02,860
Like they come out like,
like sinewy no body fat.

656
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,600
And you throw them in the water,
they drown.

657
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,070
They don't hold their breath,
they just,

658
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,840
they,
they don't know what to do.

659
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,080
They just gag on water and drown.
Not that I know,

660
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,550
not that I'm throwing chips in the
water,

661
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,660
but that's what they say.
But if you throw a either a baby person

662
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,130
in the water,
they hold their breath.

663
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,650
So this is the quadrant

664
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:21,800
theory,
but that's what.

665
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,720
That's what scientists are basically
saying about free diving in this is.

666
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,050
This is one of the first lap.
Sorry.

667
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,020
When I first learned about it,
it completely blew my mind.

668
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,750
How long can you hold your breath now?
Five and a half.

669
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,630
Holy Shit.
But like facing down on the water and

670
00:30:36,631 --> 00:30:39,600
not moving and doing a preparation.
Not Swimming,

671
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,400
not swimming,
just facebook.

672
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,190
If you have a dive into the water and
give you what,

673
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,510
how much time do you give yourself?

674
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,920
It depends.
It depends.

675
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,170
The fish,
Johann to depends on the conditions.

676
00:30:50,171 --> 00:30:51,004
It depends on the lot.

677
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,670
So like if you're fighting the water
occurrence,

678
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:54,930
it's more difficult.

679
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,160
Yes.
Because basically what you want to do

680
00:30:57,161 --> 00:31:00,130
when you free dive is you want to be as
calm as possible.

681
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:04,180
You want to be as relaxed as you can,
which is why yoga and meditation are

682
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:09,181
often very close to free diving because
if your heartbeat is is is high,

683
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,790
then your body's going to need more
oxygen.

684
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,350
That makes sense obviously,
and but then again,

685
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:19,060
the second year emerge your face in the
water.

686
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:22,660
You do like your first dive and then you
feel the pressure you body understands

687
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:27,410
that you're trying to to hold your
breath and you need to do that so the

688
00:31:27,411 --> 00:31:29,920
blood is going to start coming from,
from your fingers.

689
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,180
We extremities,
your toes,

690
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,820
and then you hand you feet,
so all the,

691
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,860
all the vessels I was going to start to
construct so all the blood flow was

692
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:42,870
going to go towards your vitals organs
so you actually,

693
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,960
you body is getting ready for it,
so they want to make sure that the

694
00:31:45,961 --> 00:31:50,380
oxygen's goes exactly what needs to be.
It makes sure that you need as as less

695
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:53,220
effort to do anything is possible when
you actually underwater.

696
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,440
Now,
when you first tried holding your

697
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:58,290
breath,
how long did you have for

698
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,850
your first time?
I did it.

699
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,850
Yeah.
I think my first time trying it,

700
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:03,870
it was about a minute,

701
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,690
so that was like the best he could do.
No techniques just ready to

702
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,960
no,
no technique like,

703
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,840
like they,
they,

704
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,250
you breed a little bit before.
So even with techniques.

705
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,420
Yeah,
we'll techniques.

706
00:32:14,421 --> 00:32:18,170
It was,
it's when you hold your brand,

707
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,920
you have the ability of two in your body
because you're not excelling any.

708
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,820
And then when you body realizes that is
a buildup,

709
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,320
it gives you an urge to breathe and then
it gives you construct contractions like

710
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:33,200
diaphragm contractions and this is what
makes somebody panicked.

711
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,280
You know,
like my buddy,

712
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:36,800
you need to hear when you want to,
you want to hear and then the more you

713
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:41,480
train then you realized that you learn
how to control it and it's not because

714
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:45,320
you body tell you to breathe that you
necessarily out of oxygen.

715
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,430
Hm.

716
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,260
So how,
what,

717
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,030
what techniques do you do to relax that

718
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,770
breeding?
So I do mostly,

719
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,250
especially when I'm in the water,
I do a very short inhale,

720
00:32:57,251 --> 00:33:00,340
so about five seconds and then I do a
long inhale,

721
00:33:00,341 --> 00:33:03,160
maybe 10 to 15 seconds.
And then when you,

722
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:06,610
when you exhale,
you're focusing on like everything

723
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:09,850
getting relaxed and then you're going to
do that again because you said inhale

724
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:10,331
twice.
Oh,

725
00:33:10,331 --> 00:33:11,680
sorry,
I didn't mean to know.

726
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,480
So you inhale for five seconds and then
you exhale for 10 to 15 seconds.

727
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,710
Oh,
okay.

728
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,940
So you exhale slowly.

729
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,230
You Excel super slowly.
Use your tongue to control the air

730
00:33:22,231 --> 00:33:24,960
coming out.
And then when you do that you get as

731
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,660
relaxed as possible and then the more
relaxed you are,

732
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,930
that along with your mom will diving
reflex,

733
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,650
which is your heart beating,
slow down.

734
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,810
Naturally you blood shifting from
extremities to your vital organs.

735
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,670
And then you also have about a few years
ago,

736
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,970
maybe only 50 years ago,
they taught that when you reach 30

737
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:46,830
meters,
you body would be completely crushed

738
00:33:46,831 --> 00:33:50,030
inside.
That was a scientist would think 30

739
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:50,841
meters.
Yeah,

740
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:53,390
something like that.
That it was like that the pressure would

741
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:56,210
be so great there that you body will be
completely crushed.

742
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,990
But then again would that would that
dive reflex.

743
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,580
What it does is that that overflow of
blood is going around you lvl leads in

744
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:07,490
your lungs,
which prevent ends from crushing you.

745
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:11,870
Buddies is actually a design machine to
go underwater,

746
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,470
which is completely crazy considering
that.

747
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,130
I've never knew that.
Especially going up in downtown

748
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:21,380
Montreal.
Yeah.

749
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,050
And then you put somebody in a water and
you're like,

750
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:25,250
hey,
you actually may for that.

751
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,550
So when people tell me,
Oh,

752
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,010
I could never do that.
It's too hard.

753
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:28,550
No,
no,

754
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,100
you,
you actually born like that.

755
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,010
So was it,
was it a revelation for you?

756
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:35,050
I mean,
did you really feel like this is more of

757
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:38,560
who I am than,
than the life that I was living before?

758
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,850
One hundred percent is I had this,
I was living in London too,

759
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:46,080
so it was all about all about,
you know,

760
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,630
earning money to buy as many things as
possible to try and impress as many

761
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,030
people as possible.
And then at some point it was like,

762
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:52,410
wow,
I,

763
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,190
I just,
I cannot do that.

764
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:59,191
Like you're not spending my entire life
just seeking to buy things and press

765
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:04,180
people that don't like.
And then when I started spearfishing and

766
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:07,930
really gave me a different perspective
on life,

767
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:13,150
it gave me them,
it humbled me in a way that was so,

768
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,970
so intense that it,
it changed my,

769
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,650
it changed my way of thinking
completely,

770
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,650
basically.
So as I was.

771
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,790
How did it humble you?
Like in what way?

772
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,190
Because I realized that

773
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,630
when we were.
Let's see,

774
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:31,200
when,
when I'm,

775
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,410
when I film a documentary and I'm soften
men,

776
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,140
I film a documentary called Echo and
they grow in,

777
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,360
in Cape Verde Day two years ago.
Back when Negro.

778
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,600
Yep.
I go,

779
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,800
what does that mean?
Black water events in Portuguese.

780
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,540
And then,
uh,

781
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,760
we were there for about five weeks,
five or six weeks.

782
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,800
And then the living conditions were
really bad

783
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,060
and there was no grocery stores around
and we had to catch their own food.

784
00:35:58,061 --> 00:36:00,630
And then it was really a self sufficient
type of chip.

785
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,250
In the first week I remember,
the only thing I could focus on was,

786
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,660
oh God,
this is,

787
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,770
this is terrible that we don't have a
shower.

788
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:15,970
No hot water or bathroom or disgusting.
I'm starving is nothing around.

789
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,730
And then all you can think is like how
you comfort is gone and after a week

790
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,280
that's the,
the,

791
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:29,630
the focus change on the good things that
we're seeing around us and why having

792
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,400
nothing all of a sudden then I was like,
oh,

793
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,480
I actually now for the first time in my
life can take the time to realize what's

794
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:42,810
good around me and then how we were
having fires with the neighbors and then

795
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:44,340
how we were offering and fish.

796
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,240
And we were thinking,
oh,

797
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:47,100
you know,
if I give this guy to fish is going to

798
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:50,190
eat one today and one tomorrow.
But no,

799
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:53,110
the inviting neighbors to share when
they make sure that it was like a whole,

800
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:56,040
like community sends to all of it.
And I was like,

801
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,570
wow,
I've been living in London for six

802
00:36:57,571 --> 00:36:58,770
years.
I don't even know the name of the

803
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,130
neighbor.
And it's,

804
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:01,551
it's,
it's,

805
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:03,780
it's bad.
It's just not a way of living that I

806
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:05,640
want.
It's not focusing in a right things.

807
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,440
And it's,
it was that,

808
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,480
that's in that way,
you know,

809
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:14,481
it's realized how much of how much of an
asshole we actually became.

810
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:16,050
And I just didn't want to do that.

811
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,350
Well,
it's a very recent way that people have

812
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:21,770
been living this,
this way of living in apartment

813
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:24,830
buildings and the way of living in
houses where we don't know our neighbors

814
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,000
in terms of human history.
It's very recent and I don't think we're

815
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:29,990
designed for it.

816
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,000
I don't think so either.
It's the,

817
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,690
the human.
I do believe that a human being to be

818
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:39,240
happy,
you need to have the sense of community,

819
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:40,750
which is why,
you know,

820
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,400
when you go into subway and you see like
somebody seeing everybody's laughing and

821
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:46,680
you see those videos,
youtube and it makes you all warm and

822
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,220
happy inside is because that's what we
were meant to be,

823
00:37:50,221 --> 00:37:51,960
you know,
and it's women to live with other

824
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:53,520
people.
We meant to socialize.

825
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,330
We meant to have this,
this,

826
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,470
this strong feeling of,
of,

827
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,910
of um,
I don't know how to say that in English.

828
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,600
I'm give,
be part of something to be part of a

829
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:06,010
group and people like that.
And um,

830
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,200
I do think it's a necessity for human
being to be actually happy.

831
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,770
I think so too.
And I think that's probably one of the

832
00:38:12,771 --> 00:38:17,240
reasons why so many people are so
grossly unhappy and so depressed and so

833
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:21,170
disconnected and they feel alienated
even though they live in these giant

834
00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:24,110
cities.
People feel extremely lonely even though

835
00:38:24,111 --> 00:38:29,030
there's a lot of people around me.
I'm one of the weirder things about New

836
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,863
York City,
you know,

837
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,520
our friends live in New York City and
one of the things they say they love is

838
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,100
how many people were there?
It's,

839
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,800
there's all this energy,
all this energy.

840
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:36,030
I'm like,

841
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,630
yeah,
we're not even talking to those people.

842
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,020
That's what's weird.
It's like you're alienated in this

843
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,530
little 1200 foot little cubicle that you
live in.

844
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,550
You know,
this little,

845
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,220
I guess 1200 foot on that small.
But you know,

846
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:52,210
some of them like Ari's places,
like I have to ask them,

847
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,850
I think it's tiny.
It's probably like half.

848
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,590
That's like 600 feet.
I was probably like $5 million promise.

849
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,710
Stupid expensive.
Right?

850
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,970
But the idea is that you don't know
anybody around you,

851
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,420
but you're stacked around all these
people and then you go out,

852
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,180
you're walking around these people,
but you're not really talking to them

853
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,330
and you have a few people that you're
friends with maybe that you work with

854
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:16,030
and you interact with them,
but then you're constantly surrounded by

855
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:17,470
all these other people that you don't
even know.

856
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,680
It's a very weird,
weird way to live.

857
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:25,120
Whereas the way you were living,
the way you were describing this with

858
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:27,820
these people and they're all sharing
fish and they're,

859
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,713
you know,
you're.

860
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,440
Everyone's taken care of everybody and
giving some to their neighbors and

861
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:35,170
sharing.
And that's how people have been living

862
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:38,980
forever.
I think there's certain human reward

863
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:43,150
systems that are built into who we are
as a being,

864
00:39:43,151 --> 00:39:48,070
as a species that just aren't being met.
And that's why I'm so fascinated by your

865
00:39:48,071 --> 00:39:51,910
choice to go from being a lawyer to
living this.

866
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,650
You know,
very a very interesting life of spear

867
00:39:55,651 --> 00:39:56,484
fishing.

868
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,840
But it's also,
it's,

869
00:39:57,841 --> 00:40:01,490
it's not always easy in the sense that
I,

870
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,040
I still haven't found a place.
What I want to live,

871
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:09,260
because it's the society isn't designed
for this.

872
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,640
My lifestyle is very hard to adapt with
modern society.

873
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,180
I struggle with a lot of things.
I don't know.

874
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,180
I don't know where to live.
I don't know because this has a

875
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:22,280
community,
you can have it in small villages.

876
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,400
So that's kind of why I've been living
in,

877
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:27,080
um,
well that anymore.

878
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:30,110
But letting them to Bahamas for a year
and I got to experience.

879
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:33,530
That's when everybody knows each other.
Everybody talked to each other to stay

880
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,390
there.
Um,

881
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,930
because for now I guess what I,
I couldn't,

882
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,200
I woke up and my ex boyfriend,
I couldn't live there anymore,

883
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:43,970
so I was his house.
I was like,

884
00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:45,170
all right,
I'm out.

885
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,210
So that is,
I,

886
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,910
I just,
I don't know,

887
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,680
it's,
I still need,

888
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,880
you know,
to survive,

889
00:40:52,881 --> 00:40:53,720
I suddenly,
yeah,

890
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:58,600
I catch a lot of my own food and my
freezer's literally full to.

891
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,860
But I,
I,

892
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,540
you still need money to live.

893
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,430
Right.
And how do you make money?

894
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,600
Um,
I get a few things.

895
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:10,650
I'm working right now on,
on a cookbook and a TV show with a

896
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,270
Canadian company.

897
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,050
Do you make any money off your instagram
page?

898
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,390
Oh yeah.
Sometimes some people do.

899
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,530
Right?
Sometimes.

900
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,180
How do you do that?
How do you make money off your

901
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:19,630
instagram?

902
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,520
Like sponsors and different things like
that.

903
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,500
I just don't like being like,
hey,

904
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,430
drink my detox tea,
skinny tea.

905
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,380
I just,
I just,

906
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:34,410
I just don't like doing that.
And the problem also is like,

907
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,230
was it two years ago?
I was a super big contract with a crew

908
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:40,010
sheet company.
They needed a girl to like,

909
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:44,270
they need to free freediving goal and
we're not that many of us.

910
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,120
So when they hired me at about a week
later,

911
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:48,140
she calls me back.
She's like,

912
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,640
Oh,
I'm sorry we can't hire you anymore.

913
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,480
I'm like,
what?

914
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,310
Why?
And she says,

915
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:56,690
because we're partnering with WWF and
our marketing,

916
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:01,180
our marketing department said you raised
a red flag because you spit fish for a

917
00:42:01,181 --> 00:42:02,014
living

918
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:05,770
ww f the wrestling wwe.

919
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,460
Wow.
That like dependent on like the one,

920
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,733
the one with dependent,

921
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,030
the one that made them change the name,
but wwe the worldwide.

922
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,290
Yeah,
that's what it used to be.

923
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,750
But what do you.
Is that what you're saying?

924
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,020
The wrestling pro wrestling?

925
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:18,530
No,
no,

926
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,111
no.
The,

927
00:42:19,111 --> 00:42:20,380
the ECO friendly.

928
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,220
Oh,
dependent world.

929
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:25,220
Wildlife Federation.
Oh,

930
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,330
they made them change their name.
That's why they changed her name.

931
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,490
Oh,
I thought they changed the name because

932
00:42:29,491 --> 00:42:33,260
of a lawsuit because they had to show
that they were entertainment.

933
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,120
Let's see.
Huh.

934
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,780
So wwf owned it?
I believe so.

935
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,380
I didn't know that.
I really thought that it was just

936
00:42:43,381 --> 00:42:48,381
because of regulations.
WWF was so,

937
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,090
so basically,
yeah.

938
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:50,960
They said like,
oh,

939
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:53,900
because we really want to keep or eco
friendly.

940
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,400
Meanwhile they're fucking boats filled
with rows,

941
00:42:56,401 --> 00:42:58,640
beef,
chicken and all sorts of other shifts.

942
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,700
Well,
one day crossed they're allowed.

943
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,460
I think it's about when you two miles
away from the coast,

944
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:05,560
you're allowed to dump your garbage and
the ocean.

945
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:10,960
Everything as a cruise ship we allowed
to open a trap and just throw everything

946
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:12,490
in the freaking ocean.
Is that true?

947
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,350
It's true.
The law.

948
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,570
It's the law and,
and we do that.

949
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:19,270
Of course they do that.
Oh my God,

950
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,340
that's one of them.
That's one of the problem.

951
00:43:21,341 --> 00:43:26,341
How many the five people cruise ship,
how many destroyed thing to use in

952
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,510
glasses because they're too lazy to
Washington.

953
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,070
That's one of the problem.
And then the Bahamas,

954
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,650
you know what you know how much dredging
you need to make for,

955
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,700
for cruise ship a boat.
Boats actually pass and dock somewhere.

956
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,430
He to rip up the entire bottom of the
ocean.

957
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,800
So it's deep enough.
It's a very,

958
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:48,340
very detrimental,
um,

959
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,430
organization for the,
for,

960
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,870
for the ocean.
And then they tell me,

961
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,940
start to become where would you,
because you catch you on food and

962
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,600
underwater it was bad for the ocean.
I'm like,

963
00:43:58,601 --> 00:44:00,970
what?
I cashed my own food.

964
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:05,050
I don't buy this disgusting farm salmon
from whole food because it's gross.

965
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,450
And Are you telling me that I'm bad?
Like what?

966
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:08,130
Most

967
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,970
people don't know that farm salmon,
they die the fish to make it look

968
00:44:11,971 --> 00:44:14,970
orange.
Like if you buy farm salmon and they're

969
00:44:14,971 --> 00:44:18,600
not dying,
it would be a white meat because they're

970
00:44:18,601 --> 00:44:20,340
not eating what they eat.
Naturally.

971
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:23,070
It's bugs.
Certain bugs give them or shrimp.

972
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:23,963
What is it?
No,

973
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,070
it's um,
Pelicans,

974
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,490
not pelicans.
One of those little fucking weird reps.

975
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,020
the ones that people have in their
lawns.

976
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,690
Salmon is not pale orange.
It's dark.

977
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,200
Omega Flamingos

978
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,880
are pink because of this.
This shrimp they eat.

979
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:38,910
Right.
Thanks.

980
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,350
So yeah,
it literally makes them pink salmon or

981
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:44,900
dark when they're wild because of their
diet,

982
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,570
their natural diet,
which includes a lot of bugs I guess.

983
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,320
Yeah.
They basically feed them and whatever

984
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,630
they have.
Like salmon is not supposed to be Pale

985
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,390
orange.
Dark orange,

986
00:44:55,391 --> 00:44:56,300
right?
Yeah.

987
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,340
Yeah.
I've caught wild salmon before.

988
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,730
It's awesome.
It is really good.

989
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,890
But sadly with all them,
the water dam that he made to make

990
00:45:06,891 --> 00:45:09,710
electricity and that almost of like
daddy killed all of them.

991
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,160
Well the killed quite a few.
There was a,

992
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:16,840
there's an interesting place in Seattle
where you can go and watch the salmon

993
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:19,690
swim up river.
There's like a bridge and you go

994
00:45:19,691 --> 00:45:23,830
underneath the bridge and they have this
setup where there's a thick glass walls.

995
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,590
We can actually look into the ocean and
wash the salmon,

996
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:28,930
go up the salmon ladder.
It's really fascinating,

997
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:32,650
so it's crazy to watch them,
but one of the guys who was there who

998
00:45:32,651 --> 00:45:37,360
was a guide who was explaining how when
they were doing construction and doing

999
00:45:37,361 --> 00:45:38,800
various things and they're building
Seattle,

1000
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:43,570
they had shut down one of the rivers and
the salmon would just get to the mouth

1001
00:45:43,571 --> 00:45:46,660
of the river where they thought they
were supposed to go and fucking die and

1002
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,540
it was crazy,
like millions of them died while they

1003
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:52,660
were trying to figure out a way to carve
this path again.

1004
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,080
Yeah,
it's very.

1005
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,800
We added dye to it.
Like Rut.

1006
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,150
Yeah.
I went to.

1007
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,940
Oh,
and diving in the when the Salmon River

1008
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:03,940
and and BC and I was underwater with my
gut.

1009
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:07,290
I could see that had like big stains of
like Rut on their body.

1010
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:11,490
So they live like a full live in the
ocean and they came to breed one last

1011
00:46:11,491 --> 00:46:13,850
time,
which I guess is a good last tours when

1012
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,920
you think about it and then it just
brought to debt.

1013
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:18,830
Yeah.
It's very strange.

1014
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,560
Yeah.
And if you catch them too far along the

1015
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:23,600
process,
their body's already deteriorated.

1016
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,190
Like um,
you know,

1017
00:46:25,191 --> 00:46:30,191
I know guys who have caught them and
then you can save in survival situations

1018
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,780
like people eat them because you have
to.

1019
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,080
But if you caught them like towards the
end of their cycle,

1020
00:46:36,081 --> 00:46:39,160
their bodies like mush again,
literally shoved your fingers.

1021
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,250
You're through

1022
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,083
it.
Yeah.

1023
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:41,760
Yeah.
Well it's.

1024
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,280
But you see that's what,
that's what people eat.

1025
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,330
But again,
you know,

1026
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:49,050
the Wall Street Journal than the
instagram page when they promoting a

1027
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:54,051
recipe for shrimp are probably coming
from Thailand or sound that is farm and

1028
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,570
very bad for the environment.
But then they think that,

1029
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,391
I don't know.
I,

1030
00:46:58,391 --> 00:47:03,000
there's something ridiculously taboo
about catching food.

1031
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:07,620
It's ridiculous.
And people imagine,

1032
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,540
you know,
how I know have been hunting has a bad

1033
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:13,230
reputation for four because of the blog
and and things like that.

1034
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,600
But I went fishing,
we deal on top of it,

1035
00:47:15,601 --> 00:47:19,140
what a bunch of lobbyists that are
finding us for deficient of same time

1036
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,940
because they want to sell those because
they wanted to fish and all we are for

1037
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:30,190
them as something in the way and we
don't buy their fish at all because

1038
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:34,060
there's so few of you they can,
they can,

1039
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,420
they can see anything that they want
about us and we don't have the power to,

1040
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:40,850
to say something back.
Right?

1041
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,060
If they shut down sports,
fear,

1042
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:45,100
spear fishing,
there were really wouldn't be much

1043
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:48,220
outcry.
How many spear Fisher people are there.

1044
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:52,900
I will lose my shit but I don't do much
while you make a post on instagram and a

1045
00:47:52,901 --> 00:47:56,800
couple of people would like it.
I got 5,000 likes.

1046
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,810
How many spear Fisher people are in the
country?

1047
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:04,820
Let's,
let's Google just America just started

1048
00:48:04,821 --> 00:48:06,230
states.
How many spear fit?

1049
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,483
How would you know?

1050
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,040
Because do you have to.
You don't have to have the license for,

1051
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:11,893
for the ocean,
right?

1052
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,550
It depends on the state.
Some states slower day.

1053
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,100
You Do,
you do have to have a license in

1054
00:48:17,101 --> 00:48:17,934
Florida.
You.

1055
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,873
Oh,
interesting.

1056
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:19,581
Well it's like,
you know,

1057
00:48:19,581 --> 00:48:24,581
$25 license and I googled that and
there's a city called spearfish.

1058
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:27,830
South Dakota gave me the populations
don't know how to find it.

1059
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,920
Um,
how many active just right spear

1060
00:48:33,351 --> 00:48:36,650
fishermen.
No disrespect to the spear.

1061
00:48:36,651 --> 00:48:39,940
Fisher ladies.
We count that much in the.

1062
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:44,180
How many spear fishermen are there in
the United States?

1063
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,070
Going back to that state or the city?
It's growing really fast.

1064
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:51,320
Actually.
It is going fast.

1065
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,220
There is like a trend now for people to
catch me on food and people are starting

1066
00:48:55,221 --> 00:48:57,890
slowly because there's so many of big
people,

1067
00:48:57,891 --> 00:49:02,891
specialist celebrities
that spearfishing voicing themselves

1068
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:07,070
when it comes to food of saying and now
people are starting to realize that

1069
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,100
hunting or spearfishing is actually not
as bad.

1070
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,610
It's way better,
but it's just very difficult.

1071
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,640
You know,
sports illustrated,

1072
00:49:16,641 --> 00:49:19,340
there's estimated between $1,000,002
million.

1073
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,080
So in the country.
Yeah,

1074
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,270
I highly doubt it.
That's a lot of people.

1075
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:28,790
That's like almost close to one percent,
right?

1076
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:30,650
There's 3 million people.
There's 2 million,

1077
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,470
300 million people.
Rather if there's 2 million spear Fisher

1078
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,610
people close.
Yeah,

1079
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:37,880
but that's.
That doesn't make sense.

1080
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,040
That's ridiculous.
That's.

1081
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,080
I mean,
even if it was one half of a percent,

1082
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,510
that's crazy.
So you telling me if you get a room of

1083
00:49:44,511 --> 00:49:46,220
200 people,
one of them's going to be a spear

1084
00:49:46,221 --> 00:49:47,330
fishermen.
Get the fuck.

1085
00:49:47,331 --> 00:49:48,021
Oh,
I'm sorry.

1086
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:51,680
This article I just saw the very,
very top is from 1954.

1087
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:55,400
Only 80 people alive.
That makes it even worse.

1088
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:00,610
That's hilarious.
You talk about pulling the people.

1089
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,680
You're a pro good articles from 2016.
You should know if you want to take up

1090
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:10,520
spearfishing.
Wow.

1091
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,930
By the know it all.

1092
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,740
Wow.

1093
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:18,050
That's crazy.
Nineteen 54.

1094
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:19,790
So I'll try it again.
Okay.

1095
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:21,640
Just give it a shot.
Whatever.

1096
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,320
I mean it's a great sport is the best
way.

1097
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,950
It's the best way to eat fish and
seafood.

1098
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,240
Oh,
I can only imagine.

1099
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,553
I love,

1100
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,480
I love fishing.
It's really fun.

1101
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,200
It can be a little stressful sometimes.
I get that,

1102
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,770
but it's.
Imagine if you floating,

1103
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,930
you're floating in a salt water tank and
then you looking around and you try to

1104
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:45,830
meditate as much as you can and then
you're waiting you in hunting mode.

1105
00:50:45,831 --> 00:50:50,300
You focusing on your pray to try to get
it and then you have like five grizzly

1106
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:52,190
bears that are circling and you try to
eat your ass.

1107
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,910
Does that happen?
I try to eat a fish that you.

1108
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,490
Do you ever do get approached by sharks
in the Bahamas?

1109
00:50:58,550 --> 00:50:59,810
Yeah,
Bahamas.

1110
00:50:59,811 --> 00:51:01,850
They're pretty much always there.

1111
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:07,140
There's a guy who just got bit in Texas.
He got bit by a bull shark and now he

1112
00:51:07,571 --> 00:51:10,210
has flesh eating bacteria that's
destroying his leg.

1113
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,480
Apparently this flesh eating bacteria in
the water,

1114
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,690
we don't need to google that.
It's pretty bad.

1115
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:17,200
Pretty disgusting.

1116
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,510
I can pretty bad encounters with sharks.
What happened?

1117
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:25,220
My worst one was in Tampa,
actually something super easy.

1118
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:29,960
It was in 15 feet of water and that's
actually the dangerous spearphishing is

1119
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,600
when you start getting cocky and you say
like,

1120
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:33,680
ah,
what is shallow?

1121
00:51:33,681 --> 00:51:35,090
It's fine.
We don't have to watch each other.

1122
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,190
Everybody's doing their own thing,
which is really bad.

1123
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:42,410
Definitely never do this.
I got my lesson breakdown and I was.

1124
00:51:42,411 --> 00:51:45,950
I showed a little fish,
do I clip it to the back of my gun and

1125
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:49,160
then this tiger shark come in and I'm
like,

1126
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,023
Ooh,
tiger shark.

1127
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,130
They a little bit.
They can be.

1128
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,850
They're aggressive.
They're not the nicest one you want to.

1129
00:51:54,851 --> 00:51:57,400
You want to show up.
And then he was a junior juvenile when

1130
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,010
it was still a good,
like seven feet long,

1131
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,560
seven years,
about seven feet long,

1132
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,800
but he was young and the young,
the one that you don't trust the big old

1133
00:52:09,331 --> 00:52:11,350
shirt or you know,
they're wiser.

1134
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,370
They know,
they check you out and things like that,

1135
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:17,270
but the young ones had want a little bit
crazy so they're going to go more

1136
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:20,390
towards you and they're going to go try
to do like curious bites,

1137
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:22,850
which is mostly what happens most of the
time.

1138
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:28,270
Which tribe bites as a curious spike and
so the discharge is in front of me and

1139
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:33,200
he's charging me what his mouth open.
So my gun,

1140
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,190
I'm,
I'm poking it.

1141
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:37,930
I'm poking like the eyes,
I'm poking the gales and booking the

1142
00:52:37,931 --> 00:52:39,670
nose.
I'm trying to poke everything is going

1143
00:52:39,671 --> 00:52:42,440
to hurt him as much as I can and in a
very strong,

1144
00:52:42,441 --> 00:52:46,010
especially in the water.
So I'm really trying to like bang his

1145
00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:51,011
fricking gun as much as hard as I could
in his face and he doesn't back down.

1146
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:55,670
He keeps like circling and he keeps
coming in for me and at some point I'm

1147
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:56,241
like,
okay,

1148
00:52:56,241 --> 00:52:59,080
like something I'm going to have to
shoot it,

1149
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,520
hoping that,
that,

1150
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:03,980
you know,
I'm not going to miss because if I

1151
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:08,120
missed and it's the only thing between
me and the shark poking it with the tip.

1152
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,160
Yeah.
I'm just pulling in with a hip and then

1153
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:13,940
you roll his eyes back,
which is when they are ready,

1154
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,470
they're ready to bite.
And I'm like,

1155
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,371
Oh shit.
I'm like,

1156
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:17,181
mom,
I'm dying.

1157
00:53:17,181 --> 00:53:17,811
And I'm like,
okay,

1158
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:18,740
well whatever,
you know.

1159
00:53:18,741 --> 00:53:20,270
So I'm like,
I'm like,

1160
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:22,370
okay,
I'm going to try to aim and try to see

1161
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:24,320
if I can shoot it.
And then my friends arrive,

1162
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,200
he's heard you screaming,
what's,

1163
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,420
do you have a fish?
I'm like,

1164
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,490
oh,
there's a tiger shy behind you buddy.

1165
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,560
And he's like,
oh crap.

1166
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:33,370
He was like,
if my from Felix shoe,

1167
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,590
I was like a 17 year old at the time and
you've never.

1168
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,770
Rarely Spear Fisher was the first time
you're seeing a shark.

1169
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,670
I promised his parents I would bring him
back in one piece and I'm like,

1170
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,121
okay.
I'm like,

1171
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,860
don't panic.
Everything is fine.

1172
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:50,280
How deeply water,
like 15 feet of water was so shallow.

1173
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,980
So I'm like,
put your back against mine and then

1174
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:57,120
cover your half and if you come to cold,
spoke it and to shy came in a couple of

1175
00:53:57,121 --> 00:53:57,930
times.
And then,

1176
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,160
because we were too,
it was like,

1177
00:53:59,190 --> 00:53:59,800
Eh,
whatever.

1178
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,910
He just left.
He didn't like that,

1179
00:54:01,911 --> 00:54:04,920
that he was out numbered.
And I'm like wow.

1180
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:08,680
So when I was alone with the Chicago was
screaming in the water and that was like

1181
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:11,100
calling my friends for help and uh,
nobody could hear me.

1182
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,900
And then we went back to the boat.

1183
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:15,490
Freeman of the water.
How far away can people hear you?

1184
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:16,690
Not,
not to,

1185
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,140
not,
not to buy 10 feet,

1186
00:54:19,141 --> 00:54:21,660
15 feet.
So it depends on the wave again in the

1187
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:24,290
winds and everything like that,
but nobody could definitely hear me then

1188
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,160
wanting to get back on the boat.
My friend,

1189
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:29,430
I see my friend swimming towards the
boat and he screams tiger shark.

1190
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:30,750
I'm like,
no shit,

1191
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,850
dumb ass.
I'd be like screaming for your health,

1192
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:35,880
but it has happened an hour and then you
get to the boat.

1193
00:54:35,881 --> 00:54:38,100
Then we left and the sharper like
cycling it was like,

1194
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,140
Ooh,
that was really scary.

1195
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:45,141
But in that situation again,
if I had shut the sharp too to save

1196
00:54:45,931 --> 00:54:47,150
myself,
it's.

1197
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:51,780
I would have got the worst publicity
ever.

1198
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,940
It's,
it's.

1199
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,640
I just one thing I don't understand.

1200
00:54:56,690 --> 00:55:00,080
When did that happen?
Were sharks became something that are

1201
00:55:00,081 --> 00:55:04,970
protected in the public eye?
Because was it the governor of New York

1202
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:10,060
that killed that shark when he was a
fishing somewhat with the governor.

1203
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:13,160
The mayor,
one of those guys was a.

1204
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:18,430
was sport fishing caught a shark and was
it the governor Cuomo,

1205
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,530
very common in the states show fishing
boat.

1206
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,230
They're edible.
I've had Mako shark and restaurants

1207
00:55:24,231 --> 00:55:26,540
before,
but something happened,

1208
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:30,050
something changed.
I think it was when there was all this

1209
00:55:30,051 --> 00:55:32,900
awareness about shark fin soup.
Yeah,

1210
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:34,820
there it is.
Andrew Cuomo.

1211
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,950
He caught 154 pound thresher shark and
everybody freaked the fuck.

1212
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,491
Got It.
It's one,

1213
00:55:39,491 --> 00:55:41,650
it's one.
They realized that the Asians were

1214
00:55:41,651 --> 00:55:45,850
catching millions a day to make sure you
make a shark fin soup.

1215
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,200
Yeah.
So it became,

1216
00:55:47,201 --> 00:55:50,470
instead of it being something that was
just another fish,

1217
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:55,000
then it became something that's
protected and people with a very shallow

1218
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:59,080
understanding of what a shark is.
We're freaking out about it.

1219
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:00,010
Yeah,
exactly.

1220
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,060
It's the Asians ruined it for everybody
else.

1221
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:08,320
How dare you be careful today,
especially with crazy rich Asians,

1222
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:10,400
number one in the box office.
Um,

1223
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,840
I mean it's that,
that practice of chopping off the fence

1224
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:15,400
and throwing the sharks back is
horrific,

1225
00:56:15,401 --> 00:56:18,730
but there's,
they're sustainable populations of some

1226
00:56:18,731 --> 00:56:21,910
sharks.
I mean apparently off of the coast of

1227
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:23,523
California,

1228
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,770
near Catalina island that the channel
islands,

1229
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,600
lot of sharks out there

1230
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,880
and then great white.
So she did populations of sharks rain

1231
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,840
out and California's very height of
great whites.

1232
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,690
Yeah.
Because the seal population became

1233
00:56:37,691 --> 00:56:39,730
really high.
And then because you know that the great

1234
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:42,250
white shark population,
it takes more time to grow.

1235
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:46,150
Now we're at a stage where days a shit,
tons of lionfish,

1236
00:56:46,151 --> 00:56:50,410
and now there's a lot of great white do.
But great whites are protected,

1237
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:51,790
right?
Yes,

1238
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:52,631
yes,
definitely.

1239
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:57,010
Tiger sharks protected.
She's protected in a lot of places in

1240
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:59,900
Florida.
I don't think you're allowed to eat.

1241
00:56:59,901 --> 00:57:02,140
It.
Depends where some marinas are very

1242
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:04,030
funny about it.
And New York,

1243
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:05,540
I went fishing in New York,
uh,

1244
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:10,330
about a couple of months ago and a guy
was like cutting and Maaco and a dog and

1245
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,120
nobody was,
seemed to be offended by it.

1246
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:13,820
What people

1247
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,850
that are on the water,
people that are Fisher people,

1248
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:18,230
they,
they wouldn't be offended.

1249
00:57:18,231 --> 00:57:20,960
It's,
it's the casual person on the outside

1250
00:57:20,961 --> 00:57:21,890
that gets offended.

1251
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,071
Yeah,
exactly.

1252
00:57:23,071 --> 00:57:23,840
But again,
you know,

1253
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,481
that's.
What's this,

1254
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:26,880
what the,
that's the double edged sward of,

1255
00:57:26,881 --> 00:57:27,740
of the Internet.
You know,

1256
00:57:27,741 --> 00:57:29,700
it gave a voice to everybody the.
Exactly.

1257
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,410
But it's just like,
you know,

1258
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:33,630
they remember that gorilla thing.
What was his name?

1259
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:35,611
Yeah.
People are like,

1260
00:57:35,611 --> 00:57:37,350
oh,
this is terrible.

1261
00:57:37,351 --> 00:57:40,200
They should have never shut the gorilla.
They should have shut the mother

1262
00:57:40,201 --> 00:57:40,860
instead.
I'm like,

1263
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,460
what we're saying when a surfer gets
bitten by a shy,

1264
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,120
they're like,
oh,

1265
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,940
it's his followers in this territory.
Like you shouldn't have like done

1266
00:57:47,941 --> 00:57:50,910
anything today,
so I can like put your mother and that

1267
00:57:50,911 --> 00:57:52,920
cage.
Would that gorilla then tell me which

1268
00:57:52,921 --> 00:57:54,580
one you're going to shoot.
My money's not.

1269
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,620
My money's on our mother's Barbara going
to be in the gorilla.

1270
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,850
Yeah.
I wish there was another way.

1271
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:01,830
I mean,
I don't know that they needed to shoot

1272
00:58:01,831 --> 00:58:03,600
that girl.
I don't know enough about gorilla

1273
00:58:03,601 --> 00:58:05,640
behavior.
I would like to think that the gorilla

1274
00:58:05,641 --> 00:58:08,040
wouldn't have done anything to the baby,
but I don't know anything.

1275
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,070
I don't.
I don't know much about the situation.

1276
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,040
It's sad,
but if I have to choose

1277
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:15,380
baby over gorilla,
I'm taking the baby every time I'm going

1278
00:58:15,381 --> 00:58:17,840
to save the baby.
Some fucking human.

1279
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:19,181
It's.
Yeah,

1280
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:22,720
but it's.
It's easy to be irrational when it comes

1281
00:58:22,721 --> 00:58:23,554
to that,
but this is

1282
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,120
not you and you don't have any stake in
the game.

1283
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:29,720
You're talking about it from the
sidelines and that's people talking

1284
00:58:29,721 --> 00:58:33,680
about sharks as people talking about
bears as people talking about a lot of

1285
00:58:33,681 --> 00:58:34,514
animals.

1286
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:35,550
Yeah,
pretty much.

1287
00:58:35,551 --> 00:58:40,551
And this is why spear fishing hunting or
is this very well,

1288
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,380
Hayden,
I guess around the world,

1289
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,000
have friends that run a bear hunting
operation in um,

1290
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:51,280
Alberta shout out to John and Jen saw
them this weekend in Calgary.

1291
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:54,380
They are,
they run a bear hunting operation and

1292
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,700
would they run a hunting operation?
But they spend a good amount of time

1293
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:00,820
bear hunting.
Black bears and the black bear

1294
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:04,360
population up there is incredibly dense.
There's so many of them.

1295
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:07,690
They're everywhere and they decimate the
deer population.

1296
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:09,460
They decimate the Moose,
the elk,

1297
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:12,430
they eat all the babies and they
cannibalize each other.

1298
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:13,450
I mean,
it's a,

1299
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,180
it's a beautiful animals.
They're fascinating.

1300
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:18,040
They're interesting.
I'm glad they're around,

1301
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,390
but they're populations need to be
controlled.

1302
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,220
There's a lot of them and they're
delicious.

1303
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,130
And the,
all these things are like,

1304
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,630
they fly in the face of reason for most
people.

1305
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,960
They think if you're shooting a bear
that you're a trophy hunter,

1306
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:32,390
like someone who's shooting a rhino or
something like that.

1307
00:59:32,391 --> 00:59:35,330
Someone who's a terrible person wants to
shoot something that's endangered.

1308
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,690
There's.
They are as far from endangered as is

1309
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,180
humanly possible.
They're not in danger by any stretch of

1310
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:44,300
the imagination.
They live in dense forests and there's a

1311
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:47,600
giant number of them and you can shoot
two of them up there.

1312
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,461
They,
they,

1313
00:59:48,461 --> 00:59:51,350
they encourage you to shoot two of them.
They're trying to thin out the

1314
00:59:51,351 --> 00:59:53,560
population because of the effect they
have on the Angela.

1315
00:59:53,561 --> 00:59:56,720
It's up there,
but it's one of those animals that my

1316
00:59:56,721 --> 01:00:00,020
friend Steve Rinella calls them
charismatic megafauna.

1317
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,130
It's cute.
Yeah,

1318
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,830
well it's,
it's just we've made them into movie

1319
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:08,831
characters and TV show characters and
people have this idea of what they are

1320
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:14,480
based on just this,
this sort of image that gets portrayed

1321
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:17,990
in the public and we accept this
narrative and I think that's happening

1322
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:19,790
right now with sharks.
You know?

1323
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,370
No one wants sharks to go extinct.
I think sharks are awesome.

1324
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:26,090
They're cool,
but there are also edible like and if

1325
01:00:26,091 --> 01:00:31,091
there's a lot of them,
I've seen people catch Maaco sharks a

1326
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:36,110
off of the coast of California and and
cut them up and make shark stakes up and

1327
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:39,860
eat them and it used to be normal.
No one cared until.

1328
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:44,600
I feel like within the last decade,
something happened in the last decade

1329
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:48,320
that people became incredibly outrage.
When someone kills a shark.

1330
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,880
I,
I actually think that people became

1331
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,100
outraged when you kill anything,

1332
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:57,640
but they're so hypocritical because
they're killing things left and right

1333
01:00:57,641 --> 01:00:59,290
with their pocket book.
They just don't know it.

1334
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,970
They're killing things.
Their credit card,

1335
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:04,150
they're killing things with cash.
If you buy fish at the store,

1336
01:01:04,151 --> 01:01:06,700
you're killing fish.
I don't care if you like to think you're

1337
01:01:06,701 --> 01:01:08,020
not.
You are.

1338
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,500
You're supporting the fish industry.
You're supporting the killing of these

1339
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,840
animals that are eating them.
It's a direct connection.

1340
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,580
You're paying a supermarket,
hitman go out and do the workforce

1341
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:17,530
one,
100 percent.

1342
01:01:17,531 --> 01:01:19,690
If you eat fish,
you cannot be against phishing.

1343
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,120
If you eat meat,
you cannot be against hunting.

1344
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:26,900
It's also the weirdness of it though.
I went to whole foods today on before I

1345
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:30,080
came here to get some lunch and as I'm
walking through,

1346
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:32,480
just because I was thinking that I was
going to have this conversation with you

1347
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:37,481
today and I'm walking by these long
aisles of ice with these fish on it and

1348
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,720
I could just point to one of those fish
and go,

1349
01:01:41,721 --> 01:01:42,554
hey,
give me that thing.

1350
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,920
No connection whatsoever to where the
thing came from,

1351
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,920
how it got there.
I just take it and I could bring it

1352
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:50,720
here.
I probably should have just for effect,

1353
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:52,760
just slap it down on the table.

1354
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:57,410
Imagine the amount of grocery stores as
a country,

1355
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,210
right?
A fish display,

1356
01:01:59,211 --> 01:02:00,590
which is completely full.

1357
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:02,570
Well,
let's just imagine in this area there's

1358
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:07,580
a whole foods that's about two miles up
this way and then if we go down the

1359
01:02:07,861 --> 01:02:09,780
street,
there's another one that a sprouts,

1360
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:13,110
they have a fish section.
Then we go a little bit further down.

1361
01:02:13,111 --> 01:02:15,900
There's a Gelson's they have a big fix
fish section.

1362
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:20,250
There's just fish all over the place,
but the ocean's pretty fucking

1363
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,600
far from here.
I mean,

1364
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,000
do you have to drive to get to the
ocean,

1365
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:25,770
you know,
and they're not going to the ocean and

1366
01:02:25,771 --> 01:02:29,370
pulling these fish out themselves.
It's all coming from a giant commercial

1367
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:32,850
boat to distributes it all throughout
southern California,

1368
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:34,980
all throughout northern California.
All throughout.

1369
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,810
Then you get into the middle of the
country.

1370
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:39,750
That's where it gets really crazy.
If you're buying halibut and you're in

1371
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:42,300
South Dakota,
where the fuck is that coming from?

1372
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,550
You know,
Alaska probably.

1373
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,950
Yeah.
You're not supposed to eat hell,

1374
01:02:45,951 --> 01:02:48,140
but if you live there,
I completely.

1375
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,260
He should be close.
She'd be close though.

1376
01:02:52,261 --> 01:02:53,580
I mean I'm not,
I'm just kidding.

1377
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:57,030
Eat you got to eat.
But it's,

1378
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:59,070
we're weird.
People are weird.

1379
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,110
And our connection with food,
olive dos boats,

1380
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:02,901
you know,
they have um,

1381
01:03:02,901 --> 01:03:06,730
I mean the states is actually doing a
way better job than a lot of countries,

1382
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,010
I must admit,
under control of fisheries.

1383
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:14,590
But when,
when I see laws and regulations on small

1384
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:19,540
little individual anglers,
your spear fisherman and then I see a

1385
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,490
chocolate.
I can catch everything you want.

1386
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:25,060
Dash just is just boils my blood to a
next level.

1387
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:28,960
Well,
it's insane and in our lifetime the

1388
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:33,580
population has decreased radically and
there's no better example than that than

1389
01:03:33,581 --> 01:03:35,080
the Tokyo fish markets,
you know,

1390
01:03:35,081 --> 01:03:39,280
the Tokyo fish market interview,
those guys and they talk about what it

1391
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:43,640
used to be like when they just the
amount of tuna that they deal with and

1392
01:03:43,641 --> 01:03:47,940
the amount they deal with now it says
significant dip and this is within you

1393
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:48,880
know,
40 years.

1394
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:51,310
Like what is it going to be like 40
years from now?

1395
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:55,630
And the estimates are that it's going to
be a radical decrease in the population

1396
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:56,650
of almost selfish.

1397
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:58,400
Yeah,
for sure.

1398
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,090
But it's,
it's,

1399
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:01,640
that's the problem.
People want to have access to

1400
01:04:01,641 --> 01:04:03,440
everything.
Now.

1401
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:07,420
If we were put regulations on
everybody's fish,

1402
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:11,210
like okay look everybody,
I know you want you salomon but it's

1403
01:04:11,211 --> 01:04:15,520
going to be close of January to me.
I know you want your halibut but you

1404
01:04:15,521 --> 01:04:17,870
can't eat it this year,
next year.

1405
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,720
If we would be willing to live with
just.

1406
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,120
I mean I think people would survive it,
that's for sure.

1407
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:25,310
Because I don't think people will get
used to pretty much anything.

1408
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:30,110
But then industry awards is worth so
much money that they were not willing to

1409
01:04:30,111 --> 01:04:30,630
do that.

1410
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:32,700
It's not just the industry is worth so
much money.

1411
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:35,880
Is it a certain people in certain
countries in particular where that is

1412
01:04:35,881 --> 01:04:39,030
all they have?
I mean there's certain people out there

1413
01:04:39,031 --> 01:04:42,030
where they,
they're dependent upon the ocean and

1414
01:04:42,031 --> 01:04:46,020
it's bounty for their survival and if
they can't sell fish and they can't buy

1415
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:48,000
fish.
And we talked about individual Fisher

1416
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:52,050
people that have boats and you know,
are doing it on their own small scale

1417
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,810
commercial fishermen.
There's not a lot of room for error

1418
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:56,550
there.
They're not making a ton of money.

1419
01:04:56,810 --> 01:05:00,200
Those are under problem.
Don't like the small family.

1420
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:02,690
A commercial fishing boat.
They're not the problem.

1421
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,160
I mean it's when you see,
when you see those guys bring it and you

1422
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:08,870
know like the guy in the video earlier.
Yeah,

1423
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:11,390
he just catching a big net is caching
like quite a bit of fish.

1424
01:05:11,391 --> 01:05:16,391
But your reality of things or ships,
foreign ships rating the entire ocean

1425
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:22,550
would net sir like kilometers long.
Like an affiliate,

1426
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:25,210
a net.
It is a mile long.

1427
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,900
And you just catch everything.
You can't annette,

1428
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:31,870
and then you like turtles,
turtles,

1429
01:05:31,871 --> 01:05:32,920
dolphins,
sharks,

1430
01:05:32,921 --> 01:05:34,340
everything.
Yeah.

1431
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,980
And then it's not,
it's not.

1432
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,720
They're picking Johnson.
Finally net lives in North Carolina.

1433
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:43,660
Are you catching lobster and uh,
and then in two that are making a

1434
01:05:43,661 --> 01:05:44,494
problem,

1435
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:48,280
but you'd have to have some regulations
that were accepted by all these

1436
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:51,190
different countries too.
And that'll be a real difficult thing to

1437
01:05:51,191 --> 01:05:55,060
pull off to get these countries to
accept that they're going to lose money

1438
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,180
and to do it in a timely fashion where
these,

1439
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,010
these fish could actually bounce back.

1440
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,150
It's not going to happen until there's
nothing left that's crazy.

1441
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:06,160
And it's.
Everybody sees it.

1442
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:09,220
Everybody is talking about it.
But

1443
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:11,820
when you look at the sheer size of the
ocean,

1444
01:06:11,821 --> 01:06:16,380
the idea that we could fish the ocean
out is so crazy.

1445
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,660
That's a lot of fish.
But when you see those commercial boats

1446
01:06:19,661 --> 01:06:23,170
and how the quantity of fish they
managed to take out of the ocean,

1447
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:26,410
it's a lot of fish.
Is there any

1448
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,590
talk about doing something about this?
Is there,

1449
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:33,280
is there anything on the table?
Is there any discussion about regulating

1450
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:36,010
the amount of fish these gigantic boats
can pull out?

1451
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,660
Well again,
the US is trying to to,

1452
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,040
to regulate that and they actually made
efforts that,

1453
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:46,170
that proved to increase the amount of
fish or it's good they actually working

1454
01:06:46,951 --> 01:06:51,690
in the right direction.
But the problem is that still to this

1455
01:06:51,691 --> 01:06:53,850
day,
I'm not sure exactly how much,

1456
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,620
uh,
how many nautical mile you have to be,

1457
01:06:55,621 --> 01:07:00,621
but a Russian or a Chinese foreigner
traveler is allowed to fish from the

1458
01:07:02,581 --> 01:07:06,840
coast of United States and international
water to just rate everything.

1459
01:07:06,841 --> 01:07:08,970
That is nothing he can do about it.
Who's going to regulate that?

1460
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:12,150
The UN China is going to be like,
yeah,

1461
01:07:12,151 --> 01:07:12,920
sure buddy.

1462
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,740
Yeah.
I mean,

1463
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:15,660
look,
Japan still killing whales,

1464
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,660
you know,
they kill whales under the guise of,

1465
01:07:18,661 --> 01:07:20,340
um,
of science.

1466
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:22,590
Have you seen how they do that at the
sea shepherd bus?

1467
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,650
Those guys pretending that it was for
science and then they kill them,

1468
01:07:25,651 --> 01:07:26,550
sell them.
I mean,

1469
01:07:26,551 --> 01:07:28,530
it's really fucked up.
You know,

1470
01:07:28,531 --> 01:07:32,130
there was this,
the same exact problems going on in the

1471
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:35,400
United States in the 18 hundreds.
A market hunting is what they were

1472
01:07:35,401 --> 01:07:36,670
calling it,
where they,

1473
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,720
they devastated all the wildlife in
North America.

1474
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:45,050
The buffalo population was almost
brought to extinction levels really

1475
01:07:45,151 --> 01:07:46,560
close.
Um,

1476
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:49,800
there's still some wild herds that exist
in Mexico and there were,

1477
01:07:49,801 --> 01:07:51,600
some of them,
they exist in United States and now they

1478
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:53,700
brought them back.
But to this day,

1479
01:07:53,701 --> 01:07:58,701
the majority of buffalo that live in
North America are all on private land.

1480
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:02,070
The majority of them,
but at one point in time,

1481
01:08:02,071 --> 01:08:04,650
there's millions and millions of them
all throughout the country.

1482
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:10,350
Elk there,
they've only been repopulated to a small

1483
01:08:10,351 --> 01:08:14,250
percentage of their original range.
I think it's something like 30 percent.

1484
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:18,380
There's some animals that have thrived
like white tailed deer because,

1485
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:21,980
um,
they live primarily in farmlands and

1486
01:08:21,981 --> 01:08:25,940
farmlands have gotten so huge that they,
they were essentially like farm animals.

1487
01:08:25,941 --> 01:08:27,650
Now.
It's very strange,

1488
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:31,880
like when you think of white tail deer,
the places where they're the most

1489
01:08:31,881 --> 01:08:34,700
popular.
No,

1490
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,890
that's actually reindeer.
That's a Caribou.

1491
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:41,180
Yeah.
Caribou are these migrating deer that

1492
01:08:41,181 --> 01:08:46,181
live in Canada primarily and in Alaska,
and they migrate for hundreds and

1493
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,410
hundreds of miles in these massive
herds.

1494
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,450
They're very different and that,
you know,

1495
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:54,170
unlike dear,
you'll see them like hundreds of them

1496
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:58,610
moving together in one group in one line
across the Tundra,

1497
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:02,150
but these animals that were in North
America,

1498
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,190
not Alaska but north,
no,

1499
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:05,600
not the,
the lower 48.

1500
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:08,690
They were wiped out almost to nothing.

1501
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,610
Antelope,
deer,

1502
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,830
elk,
Buffalo.

1503
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:16,220
They were almost all wiped out by market
hunting because this was back when we

1504
01:09:16,221 --> 01:09:20,330
didn't have refrigerators so people
would shoot these things and bring them

1505
01:09:20,331 --> 01:09:22,790
to market and people would go to market
and buy that meat and they would bring

1506
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,710
it in on trucks.
I mean,

1507
01:09:24,711 --> 01:09:28,790
I guess they just have blocks of ice and
these trains and trucks and they would

1508
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:32,180
bring in this meat and they killed
almost everything and it's short amount

1509
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:33,740
of time,
like less than 100 years.

1510
01:09:33,741 --> 01:09:37,310
There was almost nothing left.
And then they instituted these laws

1511
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,710
where it was illegal to sell wild game.
So if you buy elk,

1512
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:43,820
like say in this country,
if you buy elk meat,

1513
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,580
you're buying it from New Zealand,
you're getting it from.

1514
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:48,580
It's actually enforced right now still.
Yeah.

1515
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:49,530
Yeah.
There's.

1516
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:54,350
There are some commercial farms.
I don't know what they sell.

1517
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:57,350
I mean,
I think you can sell commercially raised

1518
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:00,710
deer and elk in America,
but if you go to a restaurant,

1519
01:10:00,711 --> 01:10:03,320
most of what you're getting,
you're actually getting from New

1520
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,570
Zealand.
Yeah,

1521
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:07,490
but you can't go to the woods,
like say if you went to the woods and

1522
01:10:07,491 --> 01:10:10,550
you went and shot an elk,
that one up there and you tried to sell.

1523
01:10:10,551 --> 01:10:12,560
It's illegal to sell.
You can't sell that.

1524
01:10:12,561 --> 01:10:16,550
Meat is not a a marketable product.
It's something that has to.

1525
01:10:16,551 --> 01:10:19,700
You have to have a tag for it.
You have to pay for the tag and then it

1526
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:22,220
has to be for your own personal
consumption or you can give it away to

1527
01:10:22,221 --> 01:10:23,600
your friends,
but you can't sell it.

1528
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:28,550
Which is much of a bad thing.
It's the only way they had to eliminate

1529
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:31,070
market hunting was the only way to bring
these populations back.

1530
01:10:31,071 --> 01:10:34,610
And then they had a enforce these very
strict conservation efforts.

1531
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:38,540
And then here's the big one is I think
it's called the Pickman Robertson App,

1532
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:43,430
whatever the Pickman Robertson's editors
is the name of that it.

1533
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:49,450
What it is is it takes 10 percent of all
of the proceeds from hunting supplies

1534
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,720
and gear and puts it to wildlife
conservation,

1535
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:56,810
which is an enormous amount of money,
billions and billions of dollars.

1536
01:10:57,110 --> 01:11:01,820
So it goes to preserve habitat and
wetlands goes to reintroduce species

1537
01:11:01,821 --> 01:11:04,550
into places where they had been
decimated.

1538
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:09,740
Like elk are now a inviolable numbers in
places where they were completely

1539
01:11:09,741 --> 01:11:14,370
extinct like in Virginia.
And Tennessee has them now as well.

1540
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:17,520
And Kentucky I know has Hassam,
Pennsylvania has them.

1541
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:19,500
And at one point in time there was none
there,

1542
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:22,770
like up until just a few decades ago,

1543
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:24,290
if it's,
if,

1544
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:29,290
if things or actually handle and they're
responsible and smart way we can.

1545
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,610
There is a way to save everything.

1546
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,141
It's.
The problem is,

1547
01:11:33,141 --> 01:11:35,830
is the United States like the United
States is like,

1548
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,690
it's,
it's on land,

1549
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,650
it's controllable,
you know,

1550
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:40,730
it's our,
it's,

1551
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:45,520
it's within these boundaries of this.
This one country,

1552
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,000
you know,
the control is accepted when you're

1553
01:11:49,001 --> 01:11:53,530
talking about the ocean
will be really difficult to get other

1554
01:11:53,531 --> 01:11:57,850
countries to agree to that kind of
strict management that brought back

1555
01:11:57,851 --> 01:12:00,550
wildlife in North America to do that to
the ocean.

1556
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:04,390
But if they did do that to the ocean
mean maybe everything could bounce back.

1557
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,390
Let me.
A few states.

1558
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:11,450
Florida is definitely one of them where
do looking very closely to what's going

1559
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:15,000
on and then they have closed seasons and
things like that and actually makes it

1560
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:18,690
really nice and big difference.
But again I think the problem is not

1561
01:12:18,691 --> 01:12:21,530
coming from that department is coming
from again,

1562
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:25,170
like deep trawling and commercial
foreign commercial fishing net.

1563
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:27,690
It's just a big industry things.
It is

1564
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:30,230
Florida for sport.
Fishing is a giant industry.

1565
01:12:30,231 --> 01:12:34,700
People go there every year to grouper
fish and fish for tarpon and you know

1566
01:12:34,701 --> 01:12:37,610
there's,
there's a lot of fishing in Florida and

1567
01:12:37,611 --> 01:12:41,120
it's probably a pretty significant part
of their economy.

1568
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:41,710
Yeah,
I,

1569
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:44,190
I,
I think I read somewhere that actually

1570
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:47,290
the number,
the number of jobs in a recorder of

1571
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:51,600
recreational fishing was higher than in
commercial fishing in estates.

1572
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,590
Wow.
I believe I read that somewhere,

1573
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:55,800
the number of jobs.
So,

1574
01:12:55,801 --> 01:12:58,030
so the number of sacred most jobs.

1575
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:02,760
So like selling fishing rods and lawyers
and guiding

1576
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,090
born butters,
things like that.

1577
01:13:05,091 --> 01:13:06,540
Exactly.
That kind of makes sense.

1578
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,450
So the commercial also,
I mean the biggest problem with

1579
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:15,500
commercial fishing is I went to um,
actually went to Taiwan last last year

1580
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:19,740
and it was helping them,
finding government and giving them a

1581
01:13:19,741 --> 01:13:23,690
proposal and how they can change the law
to make the fisheries better and ever

1582
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,820
explained it to me now.
Like they have those ships and they hire

1583
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:31,410
people from the Philippines or from
Indonesia and then they put them on a

1584
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:33,770
ship for six months.
They take your passport and they're

1585
01:13:33,771 --> 01:13:37,200
getting paid like nothing.
Literally nothing.

1586
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,100
And all they do all day long is they
catch tuna,

1587
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:39,631
it gets,
you know,

1588
01:13:39,631 --> 01:13:41,760
the kitchen and the kitchen for like 14
hours a day.

1589
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:45,070
And then that's it.
And that'll bring a tuna backs and they

1590
01:13:45,071 --> 01:13:46,170
sell it,
you know,

1591
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:47,100
the problem is

1592
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:51,740
people are fucking up so many different
parts of the world so fast.

1593
01:13:51,741 --> 01:13:55,880
It's hard to like go well we got to
really put it all aside and concentrate

1594
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:56,714
on the fish.

1595
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,633
No,
for sure.

1596
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:00,310
That's again,
there's a lot of money and a lot of

1597
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:03,570
people depending on it.
But then at some point we're going to

1598
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:04,540
have to realize,
hey,

1599
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:06,880
there's no fish.
So it's,

1600
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,260
we're more people so we're going to have
to turn herself on,

1601
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,680
on them and then.
But people are going to change their

1602
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:16,810
ways or do anything unless he being
told.

1603
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,550
Sorry,
there's no more fish.

1604
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:21,700
How long have you been doing this now?
Full time.

1605
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:23,590
About three years.

1606
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:26,620
And have you noticed a difference in
three years?

1607
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,690
Uh,
depends where.

1608
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,820
But yeah,
some places definitely.

1609
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:33,490
There's some when I'm traveling
different places what I've been.

1610
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:36,700
And the third time that I would,
a third time before time I was coming

1611
01:14:36,701 --> 01:14:38,380
back,
I could see there was even less and less

1612
01:14:38,381 --> 01:14:40,720
fish.
They didn't mean to Terrainian is a

1613
01:14:40,721 --> 01:14:42,550
disaster.
Mediterranean,

1614
01:14:42,551 --> 01:14:45,820
there's literally nothing left in place.
What will happen,

1615
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:48,370
and it's again,
that's another example where this has

1616
01:14:48,371 --> 01:14:52,570
been overfished for so many years.
They don't allow spearfishing there,

1617
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:56,590
but a commercial fishing boats is
allowed to catch as many tuners they

1618
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:58,900
want for tuna.
I mean it's pivoting easily.

1619
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:03,270
Yeah.
Anthony Bourdain did something in Italy

1620
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,120
and they.
There were so little fish that they were

1621
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:09,360
actually throwing frozen fish into the
water,

1622
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:14,190
like frozen octopus into the water and
they wanted him to pretend to catch

1623
01:15:14,191 --> 01:15:15,660
these frozen activists.
Instead,

1624
01:15:15,661 --> 01:15:20,661
he made a mockery of it and showed the
guy throwing the frozen fish into the

1625
01:15:21,151 --> 01:15:23,010
water,
frozen octopus into the water.

1626
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:25,570
I'm not surprised if you catch a fish in
Greece.

1627
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,040
You can sell it for like 100 year old
because there's no fish,

1628
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:30,960
no fish.
There's definitely no fish,

1629
01:15:30,961 --> 01:15:34,740
but people won't change their ways until
you tell them so he can have you kenny

1630
01:15:34,741 --> 01:15:35,730
anymore.
And then I'd be like,

1631
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,890
ah,
I guess I have to make an effort now.

1632
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:41,400
Fuck.
So what would be the solution?

1633
01:15:41,401 --> 01:15:42,240
I mean,
can they,

1634
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:46,500
is there a way to commercially raised
fish that's viable?

1635
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,290
It's like they do with the cattle
industry.

1636
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:50,160
Well,
I'm,

1637
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:54,310
I'm actually going to the Marshall
Islands in October and I'm going to

1638
01:15:54,311 --> 01:15:55,280
visit this.
Um,

1639
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,960
the Marshall Islands,
the Marshall Islands are those middle of

1640
01:15:58,961 --> 01:16:03,280
the Pacific in the middle of nowhere.
That's my thing.

1641
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:08,940
And I know it's near straight or
something like that.

1642
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:14,380
Know it's near Papa New Guinea and that
type of area.

1643
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:16,920
Careful the people over there.
Oh that's fine.

1644
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:20,350
I don't have much meat and like the
appetizer,

1645
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:27,030
but they have some going to visit a farm
that is sustainable and everything.

1646
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:29,210
It was any new Guinea people listening
to that.

1647
01:16:29,211 --> 01:16:32,840
I'm joking around.
People get so outraged.

1648
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,830
Who's motherfuckers calling us all
cannibals.

1649
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:38,150
Is that where it is?
Show me where it is again,

1650
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:39,553
right there.
Where your,

1651
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:41,630
where your Arrow is.
Oh my God.

1652
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,850
That is ridiculous.
Don't go there.

1653
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,970
So they told me that I'm going to visit
it.

1654
01:16:46,971 --> 01:16:50,030
I'm going to see is you just have to be
really careful because again,

1655
01:16:50,031 --> 01:16:53,810
if they leaks into the ocean and it
contaminates are fish and if some of

1656
01:16:53,811 --> 01:16:57,050
them escaped creates problems.
So it's kind of problems.

1657
01:16:57,051 --> 01:16:59,780
Does it create.
You can have a captive one.

1658
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:04,490
So basically it's going infect the other
fish diseases or diseases is

1659
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:07,160
the get when they're in captivity,
taking it all sorts of stuff.

1660
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:10,100
So it's a lot like captive animals,
avian flu

1661
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:10,770
and swine.

1662
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:11,610
Yeah,
pretty much.

1663
01:17:11,611 --> 01:17:13,240
But in.
I'm fucking great.

1664
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,180
Some really bad.
There was some,

1665
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:19,280
some stories about some really bad fish
farms that are speeding damn with pig

1666
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:22,050
stuff and it's just,
again,

1667
01:17:22,051 --> 01:17:23,820
it's all about being,
being responsible.

1668
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:29,160
We did a podcast recently about cwd c,
d chronic wasting disease is a disease

1669
01:17:29,591 --> 01:17:34,591
that's spreading amongst a deer in this
country and they think a lot of it is

1670
01:17:34,661 --> 01:17:37,540
coming or some of it is coming from
deere farms.

1671
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:41,320
They have these deer farms and all these
animals are eating off the same food and

1672
01:17:41,321 --> 01:17:45,880
they escape and then they spread it and
then there's an incubation period and

1673
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:49,150
mean it exists in the wild and it exists
in deer farms.

1674
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,040
So it's like.
It's very complicated.

1675
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,990
But.
So they have a similar

1676
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:54,260
issue with fish then?
Yeah,

1677
01:17:54,261 --> 01:17:55,440
they do actually.
And it's.

1678
01:17:55,441 --> 01:17:56,660
It's pretty bad,
but it's.

1679
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:02,080
What kind of diseases do they get?
I wouldn't know what type of deal they

1680
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:03,050
have.
It's just.

1681
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:05,690
I'm not really familiar with fish
diseases to be honest,

1682
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:10,610
but what that term is definitely like
some fish have cancer.

1683
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:12,430
That's it's bad.
What does the term

1684
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:16,400
zoonotic?
Is that the term when it leaves and

1685
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,270
makes the jump to humans?
The diseases.

1686
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:20,890
Are there any.
Yeah,

1687
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:23,740
that's what like avian flu is and swine
flu.

1688
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:24,550
Oh,
okay.

1689
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:25,000
Yeah.

1690
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,710
Disease.
It makes it jump to humans.

1691
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:29,410
Is there any diseases in fish that make
the jump to humans

1692
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:32,930
apart from parasites?
The only thing you can take of that

1693
01:18:32,931 --> 01:18:36,590
human can actually get.
And parasites are pretty rare with ocean

1694
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:37,190
fish.
Right.

1695
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:39,640
It's more common with freshwater fish
farms.

1696
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:42,630
We can see warm sometimes,
but you just discard them and then

1697
01:18:42,631 --> 01:18:43,790
that's fine.
They're not going to kill you.

1698
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:45,170
They're just going to take a little
funky,

1699
01:18:45,171 --> 01:18:49,310
but who you've eaten worms that came out
of fish for sure.

1700
01:18:49,311 --> 01:18:52,010
Right.
Most of probably I just probably don't

1701
01:18:52,011 --> 01:18:55,070
know it when I cut the fish raw cut a
pretty small,

1702
01:18:55,071 --> 01:18:57,800
so I make sure that it's nothing.
Know you look to see the worms.

1703
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,270
Yeah,
you can see them.

1704
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:04,160
Can you get in your body to where it
starts growing for a little slice?

1705
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:06,780
Um,
I'm not going to try,

1706
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:08,400
do you know?
But uh,

1707
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:10,500
no.
Will you cook the fish?

1708
01:19:10,501 --> 01:19:13,140
They all dead.
So that's why if you freeze it,

1709
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,350
that's what a lot of people freeze
there.

1710
01:19:14,351 --> 01:19:16,150
So she made before eating it.
Yeah.

1711
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:16,530
To

1712
01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:19,920
do that with pigs and a lot of animals
in this country too,

1713
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:22,350
but there's two types of tricky gnosis
apparently.

1714
01:19:22,351 --> 01:19:24,750
Maybe there's more,
but there's two very specific kinds of

1715
01:19:24,751 --> 01:19:28,260
tricky gnosis.
One that if you freeze it'll die.

1716
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:30,900
And this is a trick,
tricky gnosis that comes from an animal

1717
01:19:30,901 --> 01:19:32,640
that's from the southwest of the United
States,

1718
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,120
but then there's trick gnosis that comes
from animals that's in the northern

1719
01:19:36,150 --> 01:19:39,390
territories in Canada in particular,
like bears,

1720
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:42,210
Alaska and that stuff.
You could freeze it,

1721
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:44,220
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't even kill it when you freeze

1722
01:19:44,221 --> 01:19:46,620
it.
So you have to cook it.

1723
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,790
It has to be cooked to 100.
I think it's 160 degrees,

1724
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:54,000
some 147,
162 recommended temperature.

1725
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:58,770
You have to kill those little fuckers.
Yeah.

1726
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:01,680
Otherwise you just.
It just gets into your muscle tissue.

1727
01:20:01,681 --> 01:20:03,810
I have some friends that caught.
It's horrific.

1728
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:04,740
Oh,
that's bad.

1729
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:06,810
Yeah.
You like your whole body's like in

1730
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,280
because it's literally.

1731
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,110
They're borrowing their way into your
body.

1732
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,320
I don't think you have something bad,
bad and fish.

1733
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,760
I mean,
maybe that's why I'm skinny.

1734
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:17,080
Who knows
for.

1735
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:20,550
Well,
maybe you just eating fish all the time.

1736
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:23,760
It's probably pretty lean stuff,
but also free diving.

1737
01:20:23,761 --> 01:20:27,670
You burn when you go spearfishing.
You burn about between a thousand and I

1738
01:20:27,671 --> 01:20:30,900
think 1300 calories an hour.
Why?

1739
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:32,340
So?
He wouldn't lose weight goals.

1740
01:20:32,341 --> 01:20:36,420
Pivoting really 1300 calories an hour.
That's incredible.

1741
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,280
It's very,
very intense.

1742
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:40,350
Wow,
that's amazing.

1743
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,900
That's what you would think.
A lot of people listening to this like,

1744
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,580
oh,
I could eat so much food.

1745
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:48,030
I'll just go free diving,
but you also don't eat food,

1746
01:20:48,031 --> 01:20:50,400
which is the Marshall Islands.
Oh,

1747
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:54,420
Jesus starts to blow that thing up.
We've shown that a million times.

1748
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:57,930
That's the crazy nuclear bomb testing
area.

1749
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:02,730
That is the nuttiest shit ever.
You see that as miles high water

1750
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:05,280
spraying up into the sky.
So maybe the fish you're going to have

1751
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:07,290
like,
oh yeah,

1752
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:10,590
you're going to have fish that can read
your mind to get.

1753
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,433
I know you're coming.

1754
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:16,350
What do you spear phishing for in the
Marshall Islands?

1755
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,730
We're just going to be visiting a farm
and yeah,

1756
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:23,350
so it's Kinda good.
I have a lot of people asking me for or

1757
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:26,560
for alternatives and what it can do and
what did you eat?

1758
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:31,260
And so this is one of the possible
alternatives that they have these farms.

1759
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:32,920
Exactly.
So I'm going to check it out and make

1760
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:36,810
sure that it's legit.
And then is it possible that they could

1761
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:41,250
reintroduce fish into the ocean?
Like stock the ocean because that's what

1762
01:21:41,251 --> 01:21:42,540
they do.
Some lakes,

1763
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:45,690
like uh,
I used to go fishing at this lake in

1764
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:49,170
Boston and um,
the restock it every year with rainbow

1765
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:51,050
trout.
Yeah.

1766
01:21:51,051 --> 01:21:54,690
That's actually by my leg when my
parents have a good crunchy.

1767
01:21:54,691 --> 01:21:56,430
How's it do that to you?
And it works.

1768
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:02,180
The only problem that we see with that
for like an ocean fish would be I'm

1769
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:06,030
thinking because they never had
predators captivity,

1770
01:22:06,031 --> 01:22:09,120
that that may be in my habits revival
problem after that,

1771
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:11,880
but maybe they can learn it.

1772
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,100
I don't know.
Yeah.

1773
01:22:14,101 --> 01:22:16,680
The strong smart survive.
Right.

1774
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:21,040
You still better that if you know,
if there's 10 thousands of survivors

1775
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:22,380
still good.
It's better than.

1776
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

1777
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:29,070
I wonder what would have to do.
I wonder if it's even possible to,

1778
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:31,380
to restock something as big as the
ocean.

1779
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:34,440
It's just being fished so quickly and
that's,

1780
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:36,120
that's,
that's the biggest problem.

1781
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:41,790
But there are solutions.
It's just people have to be willing to

1782
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:46,020
talk about it and right now that's the
biggest problem with the same situation

1783
01:22:46,021 --> 01:22:50,490
as what the Wall Street Journal when
people and trying to talk about food

1784
01:22:50,491 --> 01:22:53,620
searching and mentioning alternative,
but like they're like,

1785
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:55,630
we don't eat fish,
we don't eat seafood.

1786
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,610
No,
that's not true.

1787
01:22:56,611 --> 01:22:58,800
And don't you think that it's the optics
though?

1788
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:01,830
I mean what they're concerned with is
not.

1789
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:04,950
It's not that it's rational,
it's that they don't want any.

1790
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,320
That's what it is.
So a person like you,

1791
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:13,000
although what you're doing is if you
explain it and you look at it

1792
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:14,740
objectively,
it's very rational,

1793
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,680
but they're not trying to be rational
with they're trying to do is avoid any

1794
01:23:17,681 --> 01:23:21,340
conflict.
Like there was a guy who is a nascar

1795
01:23:21,341 --> 01:23:22,510
driver,
okay.

1796
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:27,930
And he lost a sponsor recently for some
racist stuff that his father said 30

1797
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:32,800
years ago.
This is how crazy people are getting.

1798
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:37,950
Thirty years ago his father used a
racial slur and because of that,

1799
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:45,480
this guy who wasn't even alive when this
happened or maybe he was alive,

1800
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:48,370
maybe he was seven years old or some
shit,

1801
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:52,510
he lost the sponsor.
Man,

1802
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:56,110
it's one of the companies are such
cowards,

1803
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:58,930
like they're so terrified because of
social media,

1804
01:23:58,931 --> 01:24:03,931
because people are so willing to protest
and there's a bunch of fuck heads out

1805
01:24:04,031 --> 01:24:06,490
there.
They just get a thrill off of getting

1806
01:24:06,491 --> 01:24:11,491
people fired and of getting things
canceled and of like exercising action

1807
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,180
and seeing a result.

1808
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:16,630
All they're doing is pushing buttons.
It's not that they've thought about this

1809
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:17,411
and like,
Hey,

1810
01:24:17,411 --> 01:24:21,400
is this guy really responsible?
Should we really blame him for something

1811
01:24:21,401 --> 01:24:24,100
his father did 30 years ago and that's
ridiculous.

1812
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:27,160
What we should do is nothing just let it
go.

1813
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,980
I mean,
unless this guy is like some sort of

1814
01:24:29,981 --> 01:24:33,940
white supremacists are some racist
himself and he's not,

1815
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,640
we should just do nothing,
but that's not.

1816
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,110
That doesn't.
That's not fun.

1817
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:42,730
What's fun is getting a rush,
a power trip out of action,

1818
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,090
like clearly there should look.
If you find a real racist,

1819
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:48,820
something,
someone who's doing something actively

1820
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,770
to harm other people simply based on
their ethnic origin or the color of

1821
01:24:53,771 --> 01:24:54,491
their skin,
but yeah,

1822
01:24:54,491 --> 01:24:56,530
that's terrible.
You should talk about that.

1823
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,900
That should be eliminated from our
society.

1824
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:00,490
Real,
real racism,

1825
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:04,930
but that's not what this is.
What this is is people deciding that

1826
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:09,760
they're going to take action and then
Nascar being a pussy about it or this

1827
01:25:09,761 --> 01:25:13,600
company being a pussy about it and
that's the same thing that's happening

1828
01:25:13,601 --> 01:25:14,500
with you.
It's not.

1829
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:18,160
This is not a rational decision like
they should look at it and go,

1830
01:25:18,161 --> 01:25:19,900
wow,
what an interesting way to get your

1831
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:22,000
fish.
Like how many of these people that made

1832
01:25:22,001 --> 01:25:25,600
this decision actually eat fish?
I would bet it's most.

1833
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:26,860
I bet it's most

1834
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:31,990
people should understand also that by
refraining people to talk about it,

1835
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:34,700
you being part of the problem.
Yes.

1836
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:39,590
This is why things have been so bad for
so many years because nobody wants to

1837
01:25:39,591 --> 01:25:41,960
talk about it.
They all want to eat it.

1838
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:43,400
They just don't want to know where it's
from,

1839
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:45,260
but no one's looking at things long
term.

1840
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:48,890
All they're looking at potential short
term income loss.

1841
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:52,340
So what the Wall Street Journal or the
Washington Post or whatever,

1842
01:25:52,341 --> 01:25:55,190
whatever paper it is,
what they're worried about.

1843
01:25:55,191 --> 01:25:59,190
They're worried that someone's gonna
come along and say the Wall Street

1844
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:00,470
Journal support.
Was It Wall Street Journal?

1845
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:03,600
The Wall Street Journal supports a

1846
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:08,090
mass extinction of fish.
They can just reframe it and some

1847
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:12,830
outrageous,
unrealistic non the accurate way.

1848
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,720
Well,
people need to chill out to understand

1849
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:16,690
honestly.
Um,

1850
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:17,523
when it come from

1851
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:22,550
in a sense that especially like the
millennials or whatever we all born

1852
01:26:22,651 --> 01:26:23,170
with.
You know,

1853
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:26,130
we had a bunch of toys with China and,
and wouldn't you shit about dad?

1854
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,630
We ate whatever we won.
Nobody gives a shit about that.

1855
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:31,420
We had fricking process food.
Nobody cared about it.

1856
01:26:31,421 --> 01:26:33,580
We had hot dogs and nobody was saying
anything about it.

1857
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:36,880
And then we all reach like,
or mid twenties and Ellison and we've

1858
01:26:36,881 --> 01:26:37,930
been taught,
but everybody,

1859
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,000
oh by the way,
you know everything,

1860
01:26:40,001 --> 01:26:42,220
like all you barbies or they're very bad
environment.

1861
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:43,600
Oh you know what,
by the way,

1862
01:26:43,601 --> 01:26:45,500
like the hot dogs,
you've been eating every bathroom

1863
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:49,690
environment and you like,
we live in an era when being told that

1864
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:52,390
everything we're doing Israel and it's
hard.

1865
01:26:52,391 --> 01:26:55,900
It's hard for somebody that lives in
Missoula city that doesn't know anything

1866
01:26:55,901 --> 01:26:57,700
else to be like,
oh yeah,

1867
01:26:57,701 --> 01:26:57,961
you know,
what's,

1868
01:26:57,961 --> 01:26:59,590
what shoe,
I'm going to stop eating this that I've

1869
01:26:59,591 --> 01:27:02,140
been eating for the last 20 years just
because somebody told me.

1870
01:27:02,141 --> 01:27:02,880
So

1871
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,360
somebody had a very funny tweet about
starbucks,

1872
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:07,820
about als.
You know,

1873
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:11,280
the Dino California eliminated straws.
Yep.

1874
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,200
And starbucks had this whole thing
about,

1875
01:27:13,201 --> 01:27:16,320
you know,
big sign about how we're doing our part

1876
01:27:16,321 --> 01:27:18,420
for the environment.
We're eliminating straws.

1877
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:20,320
And then on the,
you know,

1878
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,050
the tweeted said,
um,

1879
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:26,430
okay.
So you're just putting plastic lids on

1880
01:27:26,431 --> 01:27:28,890
your coffee cups.
Yeah.

1881
01:27:28,891 --> 01:27:31,650
And what happens with them.
And then starbucks,

1882
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:35,230
it's an o Dot d.like

1883
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:39,510
you got fucking fixed and shit just
because you get rid of this draws.

1884
01:27:39,511 --> 01:27:43,950
You got plastic lids everywhere you go.
Those God damn starbucks lids are

1885
01:27:43,951 --> 01:27:45,630
littered on the street.
They're everywhere.

1886
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:48,330
But is this actually,
this is a perfect example because it

1887
01:27:48,331 --> 01:27:50,820
shows exactly this bit of action.

1888
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:54,360
The people are like,
they have either a very small action and

1889
01:27:54,361 --> 01:27:58,050
makes them feel better or they like to
point out two fingers.

1890
01:27:58,051 --> 01:28:02,050
If somebody else you with your Straw.
Exactly Straw.

1891
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,250
Now it,
it's,

1892
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:03,961
it's this,
this,

1893
01:28:03,961 --> 01:28:06,210
just the way people are dealing with
that.

1894
01:28:06,211 --> 01:28:09,120
They've been told that everything you've
been doing since Jay kids are bad.

1895
01:28:09,121 --> 01:28:10,250
So now they're like,
no,

1896
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,393
but,
but,

1897
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:13,200
but look at her.
She's fishing,

1898
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:14,070
she's evil.

1899
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:17,550
It's just,
it's just.

1900
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:22,220
I think it's that as soon as the way to
people or handling the fact that they've

1901
01:28:22,221 --> 01:28:24,800
been told that everything is wrong,
that they're trying to be like,

1902
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:26,690
no,
I made my effort.

1903
01:28:26,691 --> 01:28:30,230
I made a facebook post this morning
saying that I wasn't getting Straw,

1904
01:28:30,231 --> 01:28:31,190
so I'm green.

1905
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:36,530
California seems to be the first state
to limit plastic straws.

1906
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:38,360
All restaurants.
Wow.

1907
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:40,950
Yeah.
Is that not as a pass,

1908
01:28:40,951 --> 01:28:44,660
but that's the.
It's been proposed governor Jerry Brown.

1909
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:48,320
I just had.
How can it be so difficult?

1910
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:49,340
She'd be like,
look,

1911
01:28:49,610 --> 01:28:52,580
plastic is a problem.
You use something else.

1912
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:54,210
You know,
one thing that they,

1913
01:28:54,211 --> 01:28:55,470
um,
I don't know,

1914
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:58,110
maybe I saw this with Europe or the US
fund this on your page,

1915
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:02,220
that there's a,
a new that they use

1916
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:07,050
for water runoff before it goes into the
ocean is his giant net that catches all

1917
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:09,530
this plastic particles.
Was that on your instagram page?

1918
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:12,000
Know that?
It's really interesting.

1919
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:16,030
Someone has invented this cover that's
like a,

1920
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,950
it's like a filter that as the water's
going through,

1921
01:29:19,951 --> 01:29:23,370
it catches all the stuff that would
ordinarily be washed out to sea.

1922
01:29:23,371 --> 01:29:26,250
And so it basically over these storm
drainage pipes,

1923
01:29:26,251 --> 01:29:29,400
he's enormous.
Pious is this huge net so the water can

1924
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:32,730
still go through it,
but just shows you like this insane

1925
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:37,731
amount of debris and garbage that would
have ordinarily just been washed out to

1926
01:29:38,761 --> 01:29:42,940
sea and the catching it in these nets.
It's not everything but it's a start and

1927
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:46,560
it's not going to make up for the FEC
and cruise ship that's dumping things

1928
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:48,930
just right off shore.
It's crazy.

1929
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,430
I did not know that.
That was the case.

1930
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:51,090
Yeah,
you,

1931
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:51,771
you,
it's,

1932
01:29:51,771 --> 01:29:54,530
it's legal to.
And that's the worst part of it.

1933
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:59,660
But
you spearfish,

1934
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:02,690
spearfish,
because I'm the bad guy.

1935
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:03,673
So

1936
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:07,700
would you want to do is you want to
spear fish and you want to raise

1937
01:30:07,701 --> 01:30:09,920
awareness that you want to continue to
live this life.

1938
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:13,670
So what you're trying to do along the
way is trying to figure out how to make

1939
01:30:13,671 --> 01:30:15,290
a living while you're doing it.

1940
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,120
Yeah,
I do.

1941
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:18,954
I'm,
I'm,

1942
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:21,120
I'm going to want to write a book.
At some point

1943
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,630
I might ask you how old you are.
I'm 31.

1944
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:26,720
So this is an age where people are like,
oh Jesus,

1945
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:29,300
you're in your thirties,
should have your shit together by now.

1946
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:32,030
That's a lot of people think you know,
it's,

1947
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:34,340
you're in that area were like,
you should have,

1948
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:37,390
you should have your career in order.
She's thinking about settling down,

1949
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,520
having a family.
You should start your 401k and you

1950
01:30:40,521 --> 01:30:44,270
should have all this stuff in line and
you're out there fishing,

1951
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:45,133
stabbing fish.

1952
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:46,790
No,
I don't.

1953
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:48,120
I don't mind that.
I don't think my,

1954
01:30:48,121 --> 01:30:50,430
my age is an issue.
It's

1955
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,040
no,
I don't think it's an issue either.

1956
01:30:52,041 --> 01:30:57,041
I'm just saying that in the path from
graduating high school to go into

1957
01:30:57,411 --> 01:31:01,520
college to become an a person that's 31
years old.

1958
01:31:01,521 --> 01:31:06,350
I mean a lot of people compare
themselves in a very sort of foolish

1959
01:31:06,351 --> 01:31:08,450
way.
They compare themselves with other

1960
01:31:08,451 --> 01:31:10,300
people,
like how much stuff have these people

1961
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,080
accumulated,
how much you buy.

1962
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:13,570
But it was,
for me,

1963
01:31:13,571 --> 01:31:16,350
it was,
it was a crucial step of my life to be

1964
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:19,560
able to take a step back.
I want to take a step back of all of

1965
01:31:19,561 --> 01:31:20,550
that and be like,
okay,

1966
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:21,270
Whoa,
whoa.

1967
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:26,270
Like I've been telling the same thing
since I'm born about what I should want,

1968
01:31:27,031 --> 01:31:28,960
about what I should do about,
you know,

1969
01:31:29,210 --> 01:31:31,590
about what me.
Exactly.

1970
01:31:31,591 --> 01:31:34,950
You know,
it's like when I was one of his seven

1971
01:31:34,951 --> 01:31:36,750
years old,
I look at my mom and I said,

1972
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:37,801
you know,
mom,

1973
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:40,380
when I grow up,
I'd rather have like a job that I don't

1974
01:31:40,381 --> 01:31:42,240
like when I make a shit ton of money,
not a job.

1975
01:31:42,241 --> 01:31:43,470
I love what I make,
nothing.

1976
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,740
I was seven.
I told that to my mother and my mom was

1977
01:31:46,741 --> 01:31:48,900
like,
what did I do wrong?

1978
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:51,540
Well,
that's a rational thought with kids

1979
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:54,430
because then when I quit my job,
then my mom was the one being like,

1980
01:31:54,730 --> 01:31:55,680
what are you doing dad?

1981
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,420
You have no security in life and blah,
blah blah.

1982
01:31:57,421 --> 01:31:58,141
And I'm like,
well,

1983
01:31:58,141 --> 01:31:58,741
sorry.
It's,

1984
01:31:58,741 --> 01:31:59,501
it's,
it's good.

1985
01:31:59,501 --> 01:32:01,330
I need,
I need to step back.

1986
01:32:01,331 --> 01:32:05,020
I need to look at everything around me.
I need to look at society in each to

1987
01:32:05,021 --> 01:32:06,420
look how things work.
And I,

1988
01:32:06,421 --> 01:32:09,610
I want to make sure that when I'm,
when I'm in it,

1989
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:13,330
it's because I actually,
I know what I want

1990
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:16,600
and I'm at,
I don't like being told what to do.

1991
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:18,790
Right.
So that's,

1992
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:20,620
that's kind of what I'm doing and
figuring out my own thing and the

1993
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:21,460
fingernail,
what's,

1994
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:25,150
what's important for me in what my real
values are and I don't think you can

1995
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,720
discover depression.
You really are by staying in your nine

1996
01:32:28,721 --> 01:32:33,430
to five by not knowing anything and
being unhappy and not being able to go

1997
01:32:33,431 --> 01:32:34,930
outside of your comfort zone.

1998
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:36,260
Right.
Comfort zones,

1999
01:32:36,261 --> 01:32:36,951
the big word,
right?

2000
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:38,990
Because it's comforting that you get
that check every week.

2001
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:40,840
It is,
but it's fine.

2002
01:32:41,210 --> 01:32:42,043
It's numbing.

2003
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,730
You have kids,
you have this and that,

2004
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,730
but it's people that tell me like,
oh,

2005
01:32:46,490 --> 01:32:48,730
I used to encourage us to have done that
were,

2006
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:51,020
oh,
I envy you life so much.

2007
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:51,923
And like,
well,

2008
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:55,220
when I first quit my job,
I live in my fricking car for awhile

2009
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,250
because I didn't have a place to stay
and neither no money to sustain myself.

2010
01:32:58,430 --> 01:32:59,810
Did you really live in your car?
Yeah,

2011
01:32:59,811 --> 01:33:01,140
I did for awhile.
How long?

2012
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,600
Like if I like a month,
something like that and what?

2013
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:07,730
It was like sporadic in my car.
Or did you shower somewhere?

2014
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:08,091
No,
no,

2015
01:33:08,091 --> 01:33:10,970
I have friends so I was like,
showering is also beaches,

2016
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,030
the showers and the beach,
but I wasn't sure

2017
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,600
when that was happening.
How old were you at the time?

2018
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,710
Twenty three years ago.
So 20.

2019
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,140
So you're 28.

2020
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:24,090
You were you like,
what the fuck am I doing with my life?

2021
01:33:24,091 --> 01:33:25,380
I'm living in my car.

2022
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,420
Yeah,
but I haven't.

2023
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:29,160
Yeah,
but I felt I felt free and I never

2024
01:33:29,161 --> 01:33:30,890
regret in my life.
And that's okay.

2025
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:33,850
Well you are courageous if that's the
case because a lot of people would panic

2026
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:34,684
me included.

2027
01:33:35,790 --> 01:33:40,790
It's I guess you courageous in a way
regarding the fact that you're sleeping

2028
01:33:41,461 --> 01:33:45,150
in a car,
but if he unhappy with your life,

2029
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:46,950
why?
Why keep going with it?

2030
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:49,250
Well,
that's what you're saying is logical,

2031
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,670
right?
But logic is not how most people live

2032
01:33:52,671 --> 01:33:55,390
their lives.
What you're saying is like your

2033
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:58,070
romantic,
like you're saying,

2034
01:33:58,071 --> 01:34:02,960
I want to live my life with passion and
I want to follow my interests and I

2035
01:34:02,961 --> 01:34:05,630
don't mind living in my car and
showering at the beach.

2036
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:08,270
I don't mind.
I'm fine with that.

2037
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:12,160
Most people are not fine with that.
Most people would be insecure and they

2038
01:34:12,161 --> 01:34:16,580
would be scared of the future and they
would want some sort of stability and

2039
01:34:16,581 --> 01:34:19,480
that's,
that's what courageous about your,

2040
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:22,730
your decision because one of the things
that like,

2041
01:34:22,731 --> 01:34:24,860
um,
I was talking with people about you

2042
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:28,430
before I did this podcast and the
question from everybody's like,

2043
01:34:28,431 --> 01:34:29,480
how does she make a living?
I'm like,

2044
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:31,610
oh no,
I'm not sure.

2045
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:32,181
I'm like,
she,

2046
01:34:32,181 --> 01:34:34,850
I guess she's a professional spear,
Fisher person.

2047
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:37,010
I go,
but I don't know how you make money

2048
01:34:37,011 --> 01:34:37,581
doing that.
I'm like,

2049
01:34:37,581 --> 01:34:39,560
maybe a guide.
People take people out

2050
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,320
sometimes.
Very rarely.

2051
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:45,610
I'm afraid of having a structure too.
So why don't only give private lessons.

2052
01:34:45,611 --> 01:34:49,210
I'm a freediving instructor so I don't
really.

2053
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:52,150
I give lessons once in a while.
I have contracts here in there.

2054
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,820
I'm not right now.
I reached a point where I'm not,

2055
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:56,740
I'm not rich,
but I'm not starving either.

2056
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:58,450
Right,
and I'm,

2057
01:34:58,451 --> 01:35:00,550
I'm,
I'm kind of happy about it than I

2058
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:03,260
actually do believe is going to lead to
some something,

2059
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:08,030
but lead to choose something that,
to a job that I think is going to be,

2060
01:35:08,031 --> 01:35:09,950
you know,
what I'm trying to giving conferences

2061
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:12,350
around than I think that's,
that's something that really,

2062
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:13,184
really interesting.

2063
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:15,690
Conferences like this woman's
empowerment thing.

2064
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:16,440
You were going to talk?

2065
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,273
Yeah,
pretty much.

2066
01:35:17,610 --> 01:35:20,610
Just without all the shit going behind
it.

2067
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:25,630
Well that was just one and I'm sure
people love a story about someone who's

2068
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:30,830
following their passion because there's
so many people out there that really

2069
01:35:30,831 --> 01:35:33,650
desperately want to do that.
They just don't know how to do it or how

2070
01:35:33,651 --> 01:35:38,651
to get the courage to do it or they get
stuck with a mortgage or maybe they have

2071
01:35:38,931 --> 01:35:42,140
a family and responsibilities or maybe
they have loved ones that are taken care

2072
01:35:42,141 --> 01:35:45,410
of and they can't.
And so when they hear about someone

2073
01:35:45,411 --> 01:35:48,800
who's going for it,
either they're jealous of you and they

2074
01:35:48,801 --> 01:35:50,360
hate on it,
and they say that stupid,

2075
01:35:50,361 --> 01:35:51,171
that girl's a fool,
blah,

2076
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:52,610
blah blah.
Or they go,

2077
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:53,720
God,
I wish I could do that.

2078
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,100
Those,
those are the two.

2079
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,500
Depending upon the mindset of the person
that's watching you,

2080
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:59,300
that's going to be their reaction.

2081
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,980
I completely agree.
Well,

2082
01:36:00,981 --> 01:36:02,480
I have,
I had a TV show coming on,

2083
01:36:02,481 --> 01:36:04,700
have my coo book coming on.
What's the TV show?

2084
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:07,460
I have a TV.
It's going to be in French,

2085
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:08,420
but it's,
it's about,

2086
01:36:08,421 --> 01:36:10,880
I'm going to be traveling around the
world and fishing with.

2087
01:36:11,790 --> 01:36:13,070
I'm not even sure I'm ready to talk
about that.

2088
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:14,810
Um,
whoops.

2089
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:18,980
Was a TV show is going to be fun.
And I'm starting with my sister just

2090
01:36:18,981 --> 01:36:22,880
graduated from fashion design in London
and we're just starting.

2091
01:36:22,881 --> 01:36:27,110
I'm a bathing suit company with recycled
fabric.

2092
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,730
Oh,
okay.

2093
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,670
So what do I have a few things that
might pipeline.

2094
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:31,760
I'm not,
I don't like being bored.

2095
01:36:31,761 --> 01:36:33,290
I don't like.
I know it seems like it.

2096
01:36:33,291 --> 01:36:33,711
Like,
oh,

2097
01:36:33,711 --> 01:36:35,540
like I'm free spirited and I traveled
around,

2098
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:38,720
but I'm,
I'm still a very ambitious person and I

2099
01:36:38,721 --> 01:36:41,630
do want to achieve.
Things are going to make me proud.

2100
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:43,340
It's not always,
you know,

2101
01:36:43,341 --> 01:36:45,650
it's not.
I didn't quit a bit thing to,

2102
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:48,850
to become a hippie and live on the beach
and no,

2103
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:50,150
she's rest of my life.
No,

2104
01:36:50,151 --> 01:36:54,110
I just,
I quit my job to live and build my life

2105
01:36:54,111 --> 01:36:58,220
in my career the way I want it to end in
a way that was making me proud and

2106
01:36:58,221 --> 01:37:00,830
happy.
So this is pretty much what I'm,

2107
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:02,390
what I'm,
what I'm doing right now.

2108
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:04,710
It's very admirable.
It really is.

2109
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:08,010
It's,
and it is really brave because you're

2110
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:10,770
not going to get a whole lot of
reinforcement from other people.

2111
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:14,100
I'm sure you probably didn't.
Probably wearing a lot of people that

2112
01:37:14,101 --> 01:37:15,690
were telling you,
you go for a girl,

2113
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:18,660
go sleep at the beach.
Yeah,

2114
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:20,010
senior car.
Yeah.

2115
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,200
You don't have a shower who needs a
shower,

2116
01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:23,880
you don't know where your food is coming
from.

2117
01:37:23,881 --> 01:37:24,960
Foot care,

2118
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:26,920
but it's also the group of people were
like,

2119
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:28,030
Oh yes,
it's a good idea.

2120
01:37:28,031 --> 01:37:29,470
And then a second you turn around and
you're like,

2121
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,170
am I getting wow,

2122
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:34,000
people love to talk shit.

2123
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:39,120
But it's even in my hardest moments when
I was broke or anything like that,

2124
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:43,020
I never regretted it.
Not once second I told myself I made a

2125
01:37:43,021 --> 01:37:45,810
wrong decision.
So I guess it gets signed.

2126
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:49,020
Well the good thing is you are doing
something that's so soul sucking

2127
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:54,390
that anything seems like it's,
it's,

2128
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:55,970
it's worth.
I really

2129
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,050
found myself in situations when I was
like,

2130
01:37:58,110 --> 01:37:59,410
Ooh,
I'm actually an asshole.

2131
01:37:59,411 --> 01:37:59,911
It was like,
okay,

2132
01:37:59,911 --> 01:38:02,130
I'm kind of have to work on that as a
lawyer.

2133
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:03,890
No,
even like in,

2134
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:04,231
in,
in,

2135
01:38:04,231 --> 01:38:05,340
in this life,
you know,

2136
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:08,460
especially when you know,
filming a documentary in Africa and

2137
01:38:08,461 --> 01:38:12,080
different places where you know,
you have no food and you're like,

2138
01:38:12,081 --> 01:38:15,300
I have a table of people that were
sharing like a can of tuna in between

2139
01:38:15,301 --> 01:38:16,560
for people.
And you're like,

2140
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:18,780
like,
yeah,

2141
01:38:18,781 --> 01:38:20,070
let's share.
I'm happy to share.

2142
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,110
And it's just like,
I just want to like push it around and

2143
01:38:23,290 --> 01:38:25,850
digging it.
It's you,

2144
01:38:26,110 --> 01:38:29,880
you're discovering yourself and
sometimes you don't always like what you

2145
01:38:29,881 --> 01:38:32,060
see and it's.
But it's,

2146
01:38:32,061 --> 01:38:32,790
it's good,
it's just,

2147
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:33,870
it's what it's for,
you know,

2148
01:38:33,871 --> 01:38:36,020
it's,
you've looked at yourself and then I

2149
01:38:36,021 --> 01:38:38,490
would have never discovered a type of
person that I am when I'm starving,

2150
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:41,490
run a nine to five job unless you're
starving.

2151
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,510
Right?
Exactly.

2152
01:38:42,511 --> 01:38:46,290
How many people ever are right?
Not definitely not that many.

2153
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,570
And again,
this was the thing that shocked me the

2154
01:38:48,571 --> 01:38:52,350
most and I think it's also what touches
people the most about

2155
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:58,170
Africa has been one of them is people
super close with each other.

2156
01:38:58,171 --> 01:39:02,090
People are really nice and you're really
focusing on things and it's,

2157
01:39:02,091 --> 01:39:02,701
you're like,
wow,

2158
01:39:02,701 --> 01:39:04,800
I won that.
I want to keep doing that.

2159
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:07,110
But then you know,
you spend your money there and then you

2160
01:39:07,111 --> 01:39:09,330
spend a month in New York City and you
forget everything.

2161
01:39:10,230 --> 01:39:12,630
It takes literally a week to forget
everything.

2162
01:39:12,670 --> 01:39:14,950
You know.
Another hard thing would be if you tried

2163
01:39:14,951 --> 01:39:18,070
to relay your experiences on a
television show,

2164
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:23,350
it would be edited down to even if it's
a one hour show with commercials,

2165
01:39:23,351 --> 01:39:28,351
it becomes 44 minutes and you're just
not going to be able to get all of that

2166
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:34,440
can be very hard.
I told him that I was not interested in

2167
01:39:34,441 --> 01:39:39,441
to doing anything scripted and I told
them if I want to do a TV show,

2168
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:42,870
if I'm puking I,
I wanted there.

2169
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:44,970
If I'm crying,
I wanted there.

2170
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:47,280
If I hate it,
if I'm crying for my mommy to come pick

2171
01:39:47,281 --> 01:39:48,780
me up.
I wanted there to.

2172
01:39:49,410 --> 01:39:50,980
Because I think it's.
It's.

2173
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:51,853
That's what.
That's what.

2174
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,020
That's the beauty part about those
travels and that's what needs to be

2175
01:39:55,021 --> 01:39:55,854
shown.
I think

2176
01:39:56,600 --> 01:40:01,400
that would be a real reality show,
but the reality of reality shows is most

2177
01:40:01,401 --> 01:40:04,040
of them,
or at least planned out if they're not

2178
01:40:04,041 --> 01:40:05,000
scripted.
Totally,

2179
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:07,550
and you could tell you,
you can tell when people are like,

2180
01:40:07,551 --> 01:40:09,570
well,
we gotta fix this gas pump,

2181
01:40:09,571 --> 01:40:11,300
but we're not going to get this boat
started.

2182
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:17,270
Such bad actors you see to their face,
you could smell it when they're acting.

2183
01:40:17,271 --> 01:40:18,104
It's just like.

2184
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:20,960
But that's what it was.
The beauty of the Anthony Bourdain show

2185
01:40:20,961 --> 01:40:22,570
actually it was all about,
wouldn't

2186
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:23,561
do that.
I mean,

2187
01:40:23,561 --> 01:40:26,560
that's why when they threw the frozen
octopus in the water,

2188
01:40:26,561 --> 01:40:27,550
he was mocking them.

2189
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,120
Exactly.
But it's,

2190
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,830
I mean,
I understand why a lot of people see

2191
01:40:31,831 --> 01:40:34,980
that in me.
I'm a girl and sometimes a little bit

2192
01:40:34,981 --> 01:40:37,110
girly and things like that and people
were like,

2193
01:40:37,140 --> 01:40:37,591
oh,
like,

2194
01:40:37,591 --> 01:40:39,390
oh,
she wants us to be in a TV show and do

2195
01:40:39,391 --> 01:40:41,500
this and do that.
And it's,

2196
01:40:41,501 --> 01:40:41,980
it's,
I,

2197
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:44,280
I get why,
why people would think that.

2198
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:45,840
But it's,
it's.

2199
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:47,300
I mean,
if you pass five minutes,

2200
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:48,240
you're going to be licensed.

2201
01:40:49,730 --> 01:40:52,400
What you're trying to do is relay your
passion for something.

2202
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:54,070
And when people really,
like,

2203
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:59,050
I've struggled with that with bow
hunting because I've done some things on

2204
01:40:59,051 --> 01:41:00,630
camera.
I did some,

2205
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:02,660
uh,
a film last year for under armour.

2206
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:07,630
We went elk hunting.
But part of me is like not everything

2207
01:41:07,631 --> 01:41:10,290
should just be broadcast.
Not Everything should be fair.

2208
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:12,370
Sometimes life should just be
experienced,

2209
01:41:12,371 --> 01:41:16,870
especially for someone like me who's,
I think I'm overexposed in the first

2210
01:41:16,871 --> 01:41:20,230
place.
I would be better off doing less things

2211
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:22,900
publicly,
so that's one that I've decided to do

2212
01:41:22,901 --> 01:41:27,730
less of publicly,
but part of me wants people to know that

2213
01:41:27,731 --> 01:41:31,990
there's a satisfaction to like bow
hunting in particular is very,

2214
01:41:31,991 --> 01:41:33,820
very difficult.
It's very hard to do.

2215
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:38,440
It takes intense practice.
It takes a lot of physical exercise.

2216
01:41:38,441 --> 01:41:41,770
You have to be able to run up the hills,
you have to have endurance because

2217
01:41:41,771 --> 01:41:45,340
you're climbing through the mountains
all the time and then it's hard to do.

2218
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:49,060
It's hard to find the animals.
It's hard to get close enough to shoot

2219
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:51,460
one.
You have to be able to execute when the

2220
01:41:51,461 --> 01:41:54,580
moment is there.
It's very difficult to shoot an animal

2221
01:41:54,581 --> 01:41:56,830
with a bow and Arrow,
especially long distance.

2222
01:41:57,130 --> 01:42:01,330
I mean you have to have an extreme
amount of proficiency before you can

2223
01:42:01,331 --> 01:42:03,430
ever pull that off under high stress
situations.

2224
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:08,050
So part of me wants to relay that there
is a misconception about what people see

2225
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:12,790
when they think of hunting.
They think of cruelty and they think of

2226
01:42:12,791 --> 01:42:15,310
someone who doesn't respect nature and
they think of,

2227
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:17,190
they think of this,
um,

2228
01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:22,420
they think of this a abusive
relationship that humans have with

2229
01:42:22,421 --> 01:42:27,421
animals instead of the way I look at it,
which is you have this deep

2230
01:42:27,761 --> 01:42:31,570
understanding of the food chain and this
food chain exists.

2231
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:36,490
Whether you're there or not is food
chain exists with bears and wolves and

2232
01:42:36,491 --> 01:42:40,900
mount minds and deer and elk and all
these animals are struggling for

2233
01:42:40,901 --> 01:42:44,770
survival and all you do is interject.

2234
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:49,310
You step in for a little bit and you
take your part in the food chain and in

2235
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:54,340
and in turn you also give out all this
money that goes to conservation is money

2236
01:42:54,971 --> 01:42:57,940
that goes to conservation,
ensures that this opportunity to be

2237
01:42:57,941 --> 01:43:01,300
there for other hunters in the future
and ensures that the populations of

2238
01:43:01,301 --> 01:43:06,190
these animals will stay healthy and it
ensures that they'll be monitored by the

2239
01:43:06,191 --> 01:43:09,460
proper fishing game and wildlife
biologists and all these different

2240
01:43:09,461 --> 01:43:12,970
people that are going to ensure that
these animals are this,

2241
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:15,730
this environment and this experience is
preserved.

2242
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:20,940
And The wild habitat that these animals
enjoy will be preserved and it's for

2243
01:43:21,730 --> 01:43:24,700
people,
it's very conflicting,

2244
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:25,630
you know,
for people it's,

2245
01:43:25,631 --> 01:43:27,490
it's,
it seems almost hypocritical that you

2246
01:43:27,491 --> 01:43:29,770
could say that you love these animals,
but you also want to eat them.

2247
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:31,761
Yeah.
But that's,

2248
01:43:31,761 --> 01:43:33,810
that's not what's,
what's,

2249
01:43:33,870 --> 01:43:36,900
what's,
what's the hybrid thing to do is to say

2250
01:43:36,901 --> 01:43:40,830
that you left them and then buy them for
grocery store and not caring how they

2251
01:43:40,831 --> 01:43:43,890
got there.
That's when you being ridiculous.

2252
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:48,250
What's the problem is that's been
available for so long.

2253
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:50,890
We're used to it.
Like if there was just a machine that

2254
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:53,720
you could go to where you could just get
your money from this machine.

2255
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:56,840
You talked to somebody about hunting and
then they put their fingers in ears and

2256
01:43:56,841 --> 01:43:57,840
I'm like,
oh,

2257
01:43:57,841 --> 01:43:59,280
I don't want to hear anything.
And you're like,

2258
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,550
what?
Well,

2259
01:44:00,570 --> 01:44:01,980
it's the same when you go to Mcdonald's,

2260
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:06,460
the Wall Street Journal approached you
with phishing spear phishing.

2261
01:44:06,461 --> 01:44:07,560
It's the same thing.
It's not,

2262
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:10,210
it's not a well thought out,
rational argument.

2263
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:15,220
They're worried about outrage.
And in this day and age it's very easy.

2264
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:16,450
Like I,
I had a picture,

2265
01:44:16,451 --> 01:44:19,810
I put up the other day of a target that
I have in my backyard with some arrows

2266
01:44:19,811 --> 01:44:24,160
in it and all these vegans are attacking
me for shooting fucking target.

2267
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:25,493
You know,
it's crazy.

2268
01:44:25,630 --> 01:44:28,240
I mean they know I'm practicing and I'm
getting ready to shoot animals,

2269
01:44:28,510 --> 01:44:31,670
but all they're doing is there's no
animal there.

2270
01:44:31,671 --> 01:44:35,680
It's fucking rubber to rubber elk and
they're getting angry because that's

2271
01:44:35,681 --> 01:44:40,370
what people like to do.
They like to express outrage and they,

2272
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:43,390
they talk too much.
There's too much expression.

2273
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:45,040
Take it from someone who does talk too
much.

2274
01:44:45,041 --> 01:44:46,270
Me,
I talk way too much,

2275
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:50,040
but people there,
they're not considering their,

2276
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:53,230
what they're doing.
They're just doing it and you're not.

2277
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:56,890
You don't change people's opinion by
being an asshole online.

2278
01:44:56,891 --> 01:44:58,690
You just get everyone to realize you're
an asshole.

2279
01:44:58,870 --> 01:45:00,520
Two,
I've got a bunch of Vegan following me

2280
01:45:00,521 --> 01:45:04,150
now because I took the time to respond
to their concerns and now they actually

2281
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:09,360
got it,
but how can we make improvement when

2282
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:14,110
when you have an one side and a bunch of
people that only want to do is scream,

2283
01:45:14,111 --> 01:45:16,020
scandal,
everything they see and then in year

2284
01:45:16,030 --> 01:45:18,940
decide the people that matters.
I have a strong voice or if you care to

2285
01:45:18,941 --> 01:45:22,750
talk about everything because they
scared of that first group and then by

2286
01:45:22,751 --> 01:45:26,950
doing that we're doing nothing.
I've been toning down a lot.

2287
01:45:26,951 --> 01:45:30,040
My instagram,
I stopped posting fish with blood on it

2288
01:45:30,041 --> 01:45:32,050
with things like that because people
just don't want.

2289
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:37,000
I don't want to see it and I know I
don't have a choice to do that because

2290
01:45:37,001 --> 01:45:37,834
again,
if you what

2291
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,880
but what percentage don't want to see
it.

2292
01:45:39,881 --> 01:45:43,430
This is the thing.
I mean if someone eats fish,

2293
01:45:43,550 --> 01:45:47,060
if they'd like Sushi and then they get
upset when they go to your instagram

2294
01:45:47,061 --> 01:45:50,240
page and you've got to have a spear
through a tuna

2295
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:52,880
you're on,
you're almost.

2296
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:56,990
You're educating them and a lot of ways
and the people that do get upset,

2297
01:45:57,140 --> 01:46:00,740
even though you hear their voices and
the voices are a loud minority.

2298
01:46:01,190 --> 01:46:03,410
I mean you have.
How many followers do you have on

2299
01:46:03,411 --> 01:46:04,244
instagram?

2300
01:46:05,470 --> 01:46:06,930
Eighty $4,000.

2301
01:46:07,030 --> 01:46:09,940
Same thing.
I think about 84,000 people looks like

2302
01:46:09,941 --> 01:46:12,730
in a room.
That's a giant number of people.

2303
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:16,630
Now imagine 50.
Those people are screaming assholes.

2304
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:18,640
That's what you have.
True.

2305
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:22,270
It's a small percentage.
The number of people that see it and

2306
01:46:22,630 --> 01:46:26,500
they're rational adults,
they know that in order to kill a tuna,

2307
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:30,940
there's going to be some blood.
There's no bloodless method for killing

2308
01:46:30,941 --> 01:46:32,290
it tonight.
It doesn't exist,

2309
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:37,980
but also the weird thing is that in a
way I understand the outrage on a

2310
01:46:37,981 --> 01:46:41,730
certain level.
Like when I went deer hunting for the

2311
01:46:41,731 --> 01:46:46,230
first time in New Caledonia and last
October and it was not.

2312
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:51,240
Would boast always with actual gun and
when I shot the deer,

2313
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,330
so I cry.
I was like,

2314
01:46:54,331 --> 01:46:57,720
oh my God,
I killed Bambi and it was so bad and I

2315
01:46:57,721 --> 01:46:58,740
give there.
It was like,

2316
01:46:58,741 --> 01:47:00,450
oh,
it was all cute and everything and like,

2317
01:47:00,451 --> 01:47:03,660
okay,
and then it was dead and then I carried

2318
01:47:03,661 --> 01:47:08,661
it on my back and we walked back to the,
to the house and then they started

2319
01:47:09,241 --> 01:47:14,100
cutting it in pieces and it started
looking like meat and my guilt when

2320
01:47:14,101 --> 01:47:16,020
completely away,
completely away.

2321
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:17,341
And I was like,
wow,

2322
01:47:17,341 --> 01:47:20,880
how much of a hypocrite can I be that
I'm crying because I killed fricking

2323
01:47:20,881 --> 01:47:23,940
Bambi.
Like actual physical tears going down my

2324
01:47:23,941 --> 01:47:27,720
face.
And then a second I see a piece of meat.

2325
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:29,850
I just got excited.
I'm like,

2326
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:34,800
we're going to be burgers elicited and
it sits fish is a little bit easier

2327
01:47:34,801 --> 01:47:39,570
because a lot of us have seen a whole
fish has kids,

2328
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:41,910
you know,
you put a whole in a table so that the

2329
01:47:41,911 --> 01:47:45,020
Gore is a little bit less there,
so it's more about the blood than seen

2330
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:48,240
actual fish dead.
But I bet I get it.

2331
01:47:48,241 --> 01:47:50,680
How am I know it's bad.
But I,

2332
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:54,240
I felt really,
really like in hypergrid after that.

2333
01:47:54,670 --> 01:47:55,900
I know,
I know that.

2334
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:58,550
I mean,
I felt that I felt in a weird way,

2335
01:47:58,551 --> 01:48:01,700
I felt like a weird sense of loss the
first time I shot a deer.

2336
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:04,670
Um,
but it went away when I started eating

2337
01:48:04,671 --> 01:48:07,790
it too.
And I never killed an animal before

2338
01:48:07,791 --> 01:48:08,361
that.
But I,

2339
01:48:08,361 --> 01:48:11,510
I had killed fish.
I've been fishing since I was a little

2340
01:48:11,511 --> 01:48:12,680
kid.
I love fishing,

2341
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:17,510
but I didn't feel a connection with fish
the same way I felt a connection with a

2342
01:48:17,511 --> 01:48:20,210
mammal.
It's because it's closer to us,

2343
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:23,240
you know,
our closer to our species.

2344
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:26,660
Fish is like an alien thing that lives
in an alien world,

2345
01:48:26,661 --> 01:48:27,650
that breeze water.

2346
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:29,900
But again,
the one that had like the human,

2347
01:48:29,901 --> 01:48:33,230
like eyes,
then I tend to fill a tuna is one of

2348
01:48:33,231 --> 01:48:34,790
them.
I tend

2349
01:48:36,490 --> 01:48:37,430
to,
I have,

2350
01:48:37,431 --> 01:48:39,380
I have a picture I have,
I have to show it to you.

2351
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:40,950
If tuna eyes,
it's you,

2352
01:48:41,010 --> 01:48:42,500
like it's,
it looks,

2353
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:46,140
it looks really like you can seek
suppression and,

2354
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:47,150
and,
and their eyes.

2355
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:49,280
That's when,
that's the second way people starting to

2356
01:48:49,281 --> 01:48:50,280
feel like,
oh,

2357
01:48:50,950 --> 01:48:53,780
I remember fear.
There's,

2358
01:48:54,490 --> 01:48:59,030
I think it's curiosity,
but I guess you can say from freaking

2359
01:48:59,031 --> 01:49:00,410
out because it knows you're going to eat
it.

2360
01:49:01,370 --> 01:49:03,170
It's anthropomorphization,
right?

2361
01:49:03,171 --> 01:49:04,730
We will look at animals a week.

2362
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:06,840
See,
that's one of them just actually very.

2363
01:49:07,210 --> 01:49:08,270
That's kind of human light.

2364
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:09,680
Well,
that fish is an asshole.

2365
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:10,523
I can tell looking in his eyes.

2366
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:13,680
What is that?
That's a duct to tutor.

2367
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:15,720
Those teeth are amazing.
Yeah.

2368
01:49:15,721 --> 01:49:20,130
That's a pretty weird fish that Jeremy.
Hello folks.

2369
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:23,131
So it's,
you know,

2370
01:49:23,131 --> 01:49:26,430
you can see like just like a little bit
wide on the outside and then just call

2371
01:49:26,431 --> 01:49:28,040
her and freaking out because

2372
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:30,460
it's looking out at the air for the
first time.

2373
01:49:30,461 --> 01:49:31,800
It's like,
Holy Shit,

2374
01:49:31,801 --> 01:49:32,870
it's just another world up here.

2375
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:36,300
Gosh,
actually see this.

2376
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:38,630
Well for a second.
He was right there.

2377
01:49:38,631 --> 01:49:40,580
He's alive.
She's alive.

2378
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:42,830
Yeah.
It's probably freaking out outside the

2379
01:49:42,831 --> 01:49:45,200
water.
Like what in the fuck is this?

2380
01:49:45,530 --> 01:49:47,350
Oh,
imagine if it was alive event that John

2381
01:49:47,351 --> 01:49:48,180
My ass,

2382
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:49,730
my,
my hands would have of his gills.

2383
01:49:49,731 --> 01:49:52,750
So if it comes back alive it.
This is a very,

2384
01:49:52,751 --> 01:49:53,680
very strong fish.

2385
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:54,833
Imagine,
look at it.

2386
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:58,290
It looks like a tank,
but I mean imagine being a fish,

2387
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:01,350
you live your whole life in the water
and then also in somewhat pulls you out

2388
01:50:01,351 --> 01:50:02,750
of it and you look into the and you're
like,

2389
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:06,760
what is this and why can't I breathe?
Well,

2390
01:50:06,761 --> 01:50:09,370
at least I did it very quickly.
So that's the good thing about it.

2391
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:12,370
Yeah.
But it's got to be a freakout and push

2392
01:50:12,371 --> 01:50:14,080
the brains like the size of your
fingernail.

2393
01:50:14,081 --> 01:50:16,390
Right?
But in life is Brian Pretty quickly?

2394
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:18,880
What's that?
Life is Brian Pretty quick.

2395
01:50:18,881 --> 01:50:22,050
So would you do right in the dome?
So you killed them and if you don't you

2396
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:26,560
shoot them and if you don't kill them on
a spot where the gun really?

2397
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:29,110
Yeah.
You shoot tuna with a gun.

2398
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:30,521
What?
A spear gun?

2399
01:50:30,521 --> 01:50:31,870
Yeah.
Oh,

2400
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:32,793
okay.
Spirits

2401
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,700
Gangsta.
Lean sideways style.

2402
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:39,993
Shoot him right there

2403
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:44,990
because I know they club them.
They clubbed fish and they put them on

2404
01:50:44,991 --> 01:50:46,400
boats,
but I didn't know this shot him.

2405
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:49,530
Sure you can.
But you should have underwater that says

2406
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:50,860
how you do it.
What a spear gun.

2407
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:52,930
You shoot them underwater.
Yes.

2408
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:55,660
I get that.
And then when you get it on land,

2409
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,750
what I do is,
well,

2410
01:50:57,751 --> 01:51:00,250
one,
what's most fishermen do you grab them

2411
01:51:00,251 --> 01:51:02,030
from the guild as,
sorry,

2412
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:03,540
graphic content,
be weird.

2413
01:51:04,150 --> 01:51:05,490
And then you grab it,
right.

2414
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,850
Given your knife it and a nice
intensely.

2415
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:10,240
Right.
If you do,

2416
01:51:10,241 --> 01:51:13,390
if you go lion fishing or commercial
fishing,

2417
01:51:13,391 --> 01:51:17,860
what they do is they just throw it in
the boat and then dies like 16 hours.

2418
01:51:17,861 --> 01:51:21,730
And so it's,
we kill it as quick as possible.

2419
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:24,360
Yeah.
And do you immediately throw them on

2420
01:51:24,361 --> 01:51:25,590
ice?
Yes.

2421
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:26,940
You know what?
I didn't know

2422
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:29,260
until you bleed it first.
You bleed it first,

2423
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:30,830
you know when you eat,
when you eat.

2424
01:51:30,870 --> 01:51:34,280
I'm a Sushi or fashion.
It tastes fishy.

2425
01:51:34,850 --> 01:51:37,650
It's very often the blood that makes,
that makes that taste.

2426
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:40,460
So every time we catch a fish you just
cut the girls,

2427
01:51:40,461 --> 01:51:42,950
you let him bleed.
And then that's the same with meat.

2428
01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:44,200
I just sat with me.

2429
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:45,190
Yeah,
they,

2430
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:45,950
the,
the,

2431
01:51:45,950 --> 01:51:47,710
the uh,
butcher dear.

2432
01:51:47,711 --> 01:51:52,711
They'll hang it by its legs and cut it's
throat and got it.

2433
01:51:52,781 --> 01:51:54,460
And let everything with the meat bleed
out.

2434
01:51:55,930 --> 01:51:58,000
Yes.
Certainly dead fish,

2435
01:51:58,020 --> 01:52:00,460
you have to do it straightaway,
almost in the water if there's not too

2436
01:52:00,461 --> 01:52:03,700
many sharks around because the blood
coagulates very,

2437
01:52:03,701 --> 01:52:05,980
very,
very quickly and then it becomes too

2438
01:52:05,981 --> 01:52:08,350
late and then it changes the flavor of
the fish.

2439
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:09,490
Yeah.
Because when you fill it out,

2440
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:12,040
you cut it on the side and then when you
flip it,

2441
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:15,490
there's just like blood everywhere and
then it did painting to me and then it

2442
01:52:15,610 --> 01:52:17,410
creates a team that it's not that good.

2443
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:20,930
And I think that's one of the reasons
why they soak fishing milk.

2444
01:52:21,410 --> 01:52:26,310
It changes the flavor because I think if
I remember this correctly,

2445
01:52:26,311 --> 01:52:31,311
there's enzymes in milk that destroy the
harmful bacteria that causes fish to

2446
01:52:33,561 --> 01:52:36,560
taste fishy.
And I think they said that this works

2447
01:52:36,561 --> 01:52:41,561
also with meat and with chicken,
that there's a certain smell to chicken

2448
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:44,960
in particular that when you get it,
like it's might smell a little.

2449
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:48,140
What that is,
is this certain bacteria that's on the

2450
01:52:48,141 --> 01:52:50,900
surface of the skin and then if you soak
it in milk,

2451
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:53,720
see if he could find that.
I remember I read that like really

2452
01:52:53,721 --> 01:52:54,554
recently.

2453
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:55,111
Does it,
it,

2454
01:52:55,111 --> 01:52:55,910
it,
uh,

2455
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:59,170
helps odor free cooking when you're
doing fish shark even to.

2456
01:52:59,610 --> 01:53:01,320
I tried to,
yeah,

2457
01:53:01,330 --> 01:53:06,330
that was the only time I used the sharks
know you monster while I was in.

2458
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:08,400
I'm in lunch hook in.
Um,

2459
01:53:08,401 --> 01:53:10,650
I,
I saw a guy was floating a shy and talk

2460
01:53:11,210 --> 01:53:14,060
in Long Island Long Island yet and then
um,

2461
01:53:14,690 --> 01:53:18,370
he was filling like a small Maaco
shotgun to ask him for peace and it

2462
01:53:18,371 --> 01:53:20,600
gives me a slub of.
I was like,

2463
01:53:20,601 --> 01:53:21,340
okay,
thank you.

2464
01:53:21,340 --> 01:53:26,180
So what court with my big piece of sharp
and what struck me was the smell.

2465
01:53:26,181 --> 01:53:27,530
It smell like meat.
You can,

2466
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:30,600
you can smell the ammonia in it.
It was,

2467
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:32,940
it was super strong.
And then I read on line and said put an

2468
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:36,530
milligan lemon juice for 24 hours.
Did you do that?

2469
01:53:36,770 --> 01:53:39,170
Yes I did.
And a lemon juice would break it down.

2470
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:40,460
Was it good?
Yeah,

2471
01:53:40,461 --> 01:53:42,200
that's good.
How do you cook it?

2472
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:43,880
I just fried in a pan.

2473
01:53:44,730 --> 01:53:46,410
Do you have a special way that you like
to cook?

2474
01:53:46,411 --> 01:53:47,244
Fish?

2475
01:53:47,730 --> 01:53:49,950
Um,
it depends on which one,

2476
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:55,190
but I really like lightly floured and
just icu it in olive oil and then I,

2477
01:53:56,070 --> 01:53:59,880
I cook it slowly and butter and
friendship with butter and everything.

2478
01:54:00,010 --> 01:54:00,843
Yeah.

2479
01:54:01,470 --> 01:54:06,470
Have you become like more into cooking
because you kill your own fish?

2480
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:10,190
Opposite really?
I actually,

2481
01:54:10,191 --> 01:54:14,700
I mean opposite in a way that I always
love to cook and I got into spearfishing

2482
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:19,070
because of cooking.
So this is what made me fall in love

2483
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:22,250
with the sport is the fact that or the
lifestyle you can call it,

2484
01:54:22,610 --> 01:54:24,410
it's the fact that catching mountain
food,

2485
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:29,420
I get access to two amazing fish and
seafood that is,

2486
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:30,710
couldn't be more fresh and done.

2487
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:33,820
There's a guy named Hank Shaw,
he's been on my podcast before.

2488
01:54:33,821 --> 01:54:36,250
He's an amazing chef and he,
uh,

2489
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:41,280
he has a bunch of wild game,
a recipe books and he got into it

2490
01:54:41,921 --> 01:54:45,280
because he wanted the freshest
ingredients and he wanted wild game

2491
01:54:45,281 --> 01:54:49,720
ingredients as opposed to buying farm
raised or factory farmed food.

2492
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:54,010
He wanted to be able to cook amazing
dishes from like say a wild pig that he

2493
01:54:54,011 --> 01:54:56,440
shot himself.
So he got into hunting because of that

2494
01:54:56,441 --> 01:55:00,760
and because of that it's,
it's very valuable for people that are

2495
01:55:00,761 --> 01:55:05,170
really interested in and cooking wild
game because he was a legit,

2496
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:09,970
excellent chef before he ever got into
hunting and then getting into hunting

2497
01:55:09,971 --> 01:55:12,010
and now he writes books about it and
he's very,

2498
01:55:12,011 --> 01:55:13,190
very passionate about it.
So

2499
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,200
I'm an interesting.
It was.

2500
01:55:14,201 --> 01:55:18,490
It was a very similar situation to me.
I literally got into it just pretty much

2501
01:55:18,491 --> 01:55:22,150
just for the food.
Actually the first two years when I

2502
01:55:22,151 --> 01:55:24,100
thought is pivoting ain't even likes
pivoting.

2503
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:27,850
I wasn't scared of my own shadow for two
years.

2504
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:30,940
I didn't like it.
I liked it the first time.

2505
01:55:30,970 --> 01:55:32,410
I liked it,
I liked the concept,

2506
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:34,450
I liked what was behind it.
I fell in love with,

2507
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:38,470
with catching my own food and cooking
after and all of that was publishing

2508
01:55:38,471 --> 01:55:39,700
itself.
It took me awhile.

2509
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:42,460
So you were still nervous about it?
I was extremely nervous,

2510
01:55:42,461 --> 01:55:44,220
extremely like struggling

2511
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:47,970
to breathe and every time I was going
for spear fishing trip,

2512
01:55:47,971 --> 01:55:51,090
I couldn't sleep for a month.
I was literally imagining myself being

2513
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:53,070
treated by a shark.
And this and that.

2514
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:55,560
And it was,
it was never.

2515
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:59,490
My trips never been about that even
though it was completely petrified of

2516
01:55:59,491 --> 01:56:00,980
them.
I've been lost at sea,

2517
01:56:01,150 --> 01:56:03,300
which was pretty shitty day.
I might say.

2518
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:07,980
What happened two years ago?
Um,

2519
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:11,540
I was in Mexico and I was with friends
and I was,

2520
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:14,690
I was so angry.
I hated the guy so badly what happened?

2521
01:56:15,070 --> 01:56:17,550
So I jumping in the water with a friend
of mine,

2522
01:56:17,551 --> 01:56:20,870
I've never speakers before.
And we're,

2523
01:56:21,070 --> 01:56:23,410
we're in the water in there.
No,

2524
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:24,330
no,
he never did anything.

2525
01:56:24,331 --> 01:56:24,841
He's just like,
oh,

2526
01:56:24,841 --> 01:56:26,250
I want to look around and I see what are
you doing?

2527
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:29,280
And then I see the water.
It's pretty deep and you can't see the

2528
01:56:29,281 --> 01:56:30,114
bottom.

2529
01:56:30,450 --> 01:56:34,290
And then the boats are going further and
further and further and further and

2530
01:56:34,291 --> 01:56:35,250
further.
And my friend is like,

2531
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:35,911
oh,
what's going on?

2532
01:56:35,911 --> 01:56:36,661
I'm like,
nothing.

2533
01:56:36,661 --> 01:56:38,160
Nothing.
And I'm like,

2534
01:56:38,190 --> 01:56:39,510
okay,
we're going to start swimming from the

2535
01:56:39,511 --> 01:56:41,700
shore right now for the shore.
Yeah,

2536
01:56:41,701 --> 01:56:43,020
for sure.
So start swimming.

2537
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:46,060
It was like,
it would have been doable.

2538
01:56:46,090 --> 01:56:48,750
It was like maybe a good like five
miles,

2539
01:56:48,751 --> 01:56:53,010
maybe fucking shore was five.
It was far.

2540
01:56:53,011 --> 01:56:55,820
It was like I would have done it.
It was definitely been after Darwin had

2541
01:56:56,060 --> 01:56:59,430
reached the shore,
so I'm trying not to panic.

2542
01:56:59,490 --> 01:57:02,640
My heart is like pounding in my chest,
in my throat.

2543
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:06,210
It's true thing.
Wait drifting away for no reason.

2544
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:11,460
And some of the boat,
the captain that we hired,

2545
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:15,300
that was American actually.
What do you do to start drinking and not

2546
01:57:15,301 --> 01:57:17,520
paying attention to you?
Oh wait.

2547
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:19,570
And then we're stocks.

2548
01:57:19,590 --> 01:57:21,840
I told my friend Akila swimming.
We swam for about an hour,

2549
01:57:21,841 --> 01:57:24,660
an hour and a half and then a bowl
passes by.

2550
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:29,700
So I started screaming and yelling and I
had my brewery.

2551
01:57:29,701 --> 01:57:33,270
Luckily I was swimming it and it passed
next immediate wave at me like,

2552
01:57:33,271 --> 01:57:34,090
hi.
I'm like,

2553
01:57:34,090 --> 01:57:34,980
Nah.
I'm like,

2554
01:57:35,010 --> 01:57:39,040
how do I go?
Completely nuts and bolts stuff and they

2555
01:57:39,041 --> 01:57:43,500
pick us up and I tried to explain and my
completely nexus in Spanish that we've

2556
01:57:43,501 --> 01:57:47,760
been trending at sea and it seemed like
on the boat is like right there,

2557
01:57:47,761 --> 01:57:50,100
super far away and they drop us to the
boat.

2558
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:53,160
The guy is asking me for money.
I'm like,

2559
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:56,110
I'm lost at sea.
My wetsuit think I'm carrying.

2560
01:57:57,030 --> 01:57:58,840
Took you to the boat is asking you for
money.

2561
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:02,850
They got the guy that picked me up.
It was asking me for money for tip,

2562
01:58:02,851 --> 01:58:04,920
for rescuing me in the middle of the
ocean.

2563
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:06,751
I was like,
sorry,

2564
01:58:06,751 --> 01:58:08,520
I don't have to tip in my panties right
now,

2565
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:13,020
but thank you for saving my life.
And then you drop us to the boat and

2566
01:58:13,021 --> 01:58:15,480
then we get to the boat and the guy's
like,

2567
01:58:15,570 --> 01:58:17,730
oh,
I didn't put enough gas in the boat.

2568
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:19,920
Oops.
I'm like,

2569
01:58:19,921 --> 01:58:22,830
what?
So he ran out of gas at a gas.

2570
01:58:23,590 --> 01:58:26,910
So you were.
He would never be able to get you never.

2571
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:30,540
Holy Shit.
It was so bad.

2572
01:58:30,541 --> 01:58:32,940
And then we managed to.
The coast guard came and they tried to

2573
01:58:32,970 --> 01:58:35,830
build a boat and he started telling the
the coast guard to like,

2574
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:39,660
go screw himself because because I don't
want to pay for this.

2575
01:58:39,661 --> 01:58:41,070
You already Bush of assholes.
I'm like,

2576
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:45,010
can you stop talking right now?
Oh my God.

2577
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:47,830
And you literally insulted him so badly
to Colbert left.

2578
01:58:48,130 --> 01:58:49,780
Did they take you with them now?

2579
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:52,030
That was the only boat with my friends
ever.

2580
01:58:52,031 --> 01:58:54,520
Drinking.
No understanding what was going on.

2581
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:56,190
Like,
what are you so mad?

2582
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:57,370
I'm like,
just just keep drinking.

2583
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:00,580
So how'd you get back?
And then he managed to find full

2584
01:59:00,581 --> 01:59:02,950
reception.
You call the cousin of his wife is his

2585
01:59:02,951 --> 01:59:04,900
neighbor of this and that to come tow
him.

2586
01:59:05,790 --> 01:59:09,840
He arrived like about an hour and a half
later I got back to shore and the guy's

2587
01:59:09,841 --> 01:59:10,211
like,
oh,

2588
01:59:10,211 --> 01:59:11,920
so what time are you going tomorrow?
I'm like,

2589
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:13,870
screw you.
I'm leaving.

2590
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:18,460
I'm going tomorrow.
What a fucking delusional.

2591
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:20,890
So bad.
And then we get to know you almost died.

2592
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:25,350
And I left in the ocean and I didn't
have any gas and I told the coast guard

2593
01:59:25,351 --> 01:59:26,090
to go,
fuck.

2594
01:59:26,090 --> 01:59:28,750
Exactly.
I never see you ever again and we get to

2595
01:59:28,751 --> 01:59:30,160
the car and my friend is like,
oh,

2596
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,500
I give him like $100 and tip.
Is that enough?

2597
01:59:32,501 --> 01:59:33,334
I'm like,
you did what?

2598
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:35,793
You did what?
Now?

2599
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:41,710
At
Lincoln and uh,

2600
01:59:41,711 --> 01:59:43,390
yeah.
So it was.

2601
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:45,430
Yeah.
That was the scariest thing that's ever

2602
01:59:45,431 --> 01:59:47,560
happened to you in the water besides the
tiger shark?

2603
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:49,600
Yeah,
definitely

2604
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:52,280
for sure it was,
it.

2605
01:59:52,290 --> 01:59:54,580
Was there anything else like that?
That really freaked me out.

2606
01:59:54,610 --> 01:59:57,880
That should freak you out.
Five miles is a long way to swim,

2607
01:59:57,881 --> 02:00:00,880
especially if you don't swim distance
all the time.

2608
02:00:00,881 --> 02:00:02,550
Did you have any flotation device or
anything?

2609
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:05,330
I have one buoy about that big and we
were too.

2610
02:00:05,930 --> 02:00:07,940
I was more scared because it was about
like four,

2611
02:00:07,941 --> 02:00:09,890
25.
So to sun was getting down really

2612
02:00:09,891 --> 02:00:11,060
quickly.
You wouldn't be able to see what the

2613
02:00:11,061 --> 02:00:13,790
shore is now?
Not by being with the lights?

2614
02:00:13,791 --> 02:00:15,100
Yes.
Could,

2615
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:18,990
it's more.
I was more freaked about like when it's

2616
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,630
dark and it's fuck fuck,
fuck,

2617
02:00:20,631 --> 02:00:21,410
fuck,
fuck.

2618
02:00:21,410 --> 02:00:25,390
So I had moments and spearfishing.
That was a little bit freaky.

2619
02:00:25,391 --> 02:00:29,540
I also had a blackout last year.
So under water.

2620
02:00:29,630 --> 02:00:31,290
Yeah,
that's the biggest danger of spear

2621
02:00:31,291 --> 02:00:33,480
phishing is actually blacking out.
It's not sharks.

2622
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:35,620
It's not getting bitten by an
underwater.

2623
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:38,420
Yeah.
So basically what happens is that you

2624
02:00:38,421 --> 02:00:41,450
dive down and then when you come to the
surface,

2625
02:00:41,451 --> 02:00:43,290
if you stay too long,
um,

2626
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:45,220
you,
you're on your way to the surface,

2627
02:00:45,221 --> 02:00:50,210
going to expand bag and then your
residual volume of area do you have left

2628
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:51,980
and you and your lungs and becomes
really,

2629
02:00:51,981 --> 02:00:52,814
really small.

2630
02:00:53,150 --> 02:00:55,890
So then the presenters becomes too low
and then you pass out what becomes too

2631
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:57,380
low,
the percentage,

2632
02:00:57,650 --> 02:01:01,970
percentage of oxygen in your lungs
become too small,

2633
02:01:02,450 --> 02:01:05,960
and then you just pass out.
So basically you brains shuts down to

2634
02:01:05,961 --> 02:01:09,320
make sure that a lack of oxygen is not
creating any permanent damages.

2635
02:01:09,890 --> 02:01:11,010
Oh,
what a Shitty CEO,

2636
02:01:11,011 --> 02:01:12,830
Steve.
It's actually kind of sport.

2637
02:01:13,950 --> 02:01:17,270
Not enough time,
but then that's what happens with people

2638
02:01:17,271 --> 02:01:20,570
is that when it come back up,
if you buddies not watching you,

2639
02:01:20,571 --> 02:01:22,190
and that's why I spear phishing is a
team sport.

2640
02:01:22,220 --> 02:01:24,240
If they're not watching you,
if you pass out on the water,

2641
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:26,750
what if they pass out to a sink right
down.

2642
02:01:26,890 --> 02:01:29,060
You're both doing it at the same time.
Well,

2643
02:01:29,061 --> 02:01:31,910
normally.
Well the good system to dive is one

2644
02:01:31,911 --> 02:01:35,170
person dives at a bottom.
The person is watching the other one and

2645
02:01:35,190 --> 02:01:36,230
then this one up,
one down,

2646
02:01:36,231 --> 02:01:37,064
one up,
one down,

2647
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:38,191
and then you.
You,

2648
02:01:38,191 --> 02:01:39,530
you watch each back.

2649
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:41,840
Is that what happened with you?
Yeah,

2650
02:01:41,841 --> 02:01:46,400
it was actually very lucky.
I'm the guy that was diving with me.

2651
02:01:46,910 --> 02:01:49,950
I'm lost his brother a few years before
to blackout,

2652
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:54,260
so he was looking at me very,
very closely and I was,

2653
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:57,560
I was beyond grateful to see space at a
surface.

2654
02:01:57,561 --> 02:02:00,410
I knew anything was going to black out,
so how'd you know you're going to black

2655
02:02:00,411 --> 02:02:02,540
out?
Because it was.

2656
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:05,450
I dove down and I was aiming at a fish.
It was pretty deep.

2657
02:02:05,451 --> 02:02:09,150
I was at 85 feet and I aimed for fish.
It was an impulse beard.

2658
02:02:09,170 --> 02:02:13,430
She wasn't a gun and I missed it and I
started using it in water and then I

2659
02:02:13,431 --> 02:02:14,450
miss it again.
I was like,

2660
02:02:14,451 --> 02:02:16,190
God dammit,
and then I realized I was like,

2661
02:02:16,191 --> 02:02:17,300
well,
why am actually pretty deep?

2662
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:21,740
And I've been there for quite a while,
so I started panicking a little bit so

2663
02:02:21,741 --> 02:02:24,380
when you panic you let here even more,
which is completely stupid.

2664
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:25,970
And then I started finning,
finning,

2665
02:02:25,971 --> 02:02:29,600
finning.
And then you have you started doing a

2666
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:31,940
fitting?
Spinning.

2667
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:36,410
I'm finishing a when we have new wear
fins

2668
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:38,940
kicking around.
You taking.

2669
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:40,170
Yeah,
yeah,

2670
02:02:40,340 --> 02:02:43,730
exactly.
And then what happens first before you

2671
02:02:43,731 --> 02:02:46,010
black out is you have a loss of motor
control.

2672
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:50,600
So I could start feeling,
I could feel like my body making like

2673
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:53,780
we're movements and then I knew that was
out of oxygen and then I knew that I

2674
02:02:53,781 --> 02:02:57,710
would probably most probably going to
pass out and then I came back.

2675
02:02:57,711 --> 02:03:00,230
I came back and the nice thought of my
friend who was watching and I was like,

2676
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:01,780
oh,
I really hope you really watching your

2677
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:04,910
view really watching.
And he grabbed me and then he woke me up

2678
02:03:04,911 --> 02:03:07,280
and it was.
How far were you from the surface and

2679
02:03:07,281 --> 02:03:10,790
you blacked out?
I blacked out a surface at the surface.

2680
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:14,030
Which is why it's called a shallow water
blackout because even if you're in

2681
02:03:14,031 --> 02:03:16,700
deeper water it most of the time it
happens at the surface.

2682
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:20,510
So when you got to the surface,
what did he have to do to wake you up?

2683
02:03:21,090 --> 02:03:24,650
Or you have to take the mask off.
You have to keep the head of the water

2684
02:03:24,651 --> 02:03:27,320
and then you have to blow in the eyes
because he has a high concentration of

2685
02:03:27,321 --> 02:03:28,610
nerves.
You slapped a little bit,

2686
02:03:28,611 --> 02:03:32,990
not too hard.
Call the person's name and then you

2687
02:03:32,991 --> 02:03:35,810
normally wake up pretty,
pretty fast unless you inhale water.

2688
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:39,500
What was it like?
You are a dream like if you get choked

2689
02:03:39,501 --> 02:03:41,540
out,
like one of the things that happens when

2690
02:03:41,541 --> 02:03:44,090
you get choked out as you wake up.
It's like you were dreaming.

2691
02:03:45,390 --> 02:03:46,370
I was at a disco.

2692
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:51,500
I was riding my skateboard.
It's weird.

2693
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:54,020
I've never been choked out to the point
of passing out

2694
02:03:56,080 --> 02:03:58,580
luckily for me.
But yeah,

2695
02:03:58,610 --> 02:04:01,950
I missed out on going a few,
a few minutes and I just wasn't sure

2696
02:04:01,951 --> 02:04:03,680
what was going on.
And then you just,

2697
02:04:03,681 --> 02:04:05,330
you just done for the day when it
happens,

2698
02:04:05,331 --> 02:04:07,310
but you have to be done.
Huh?

2699
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:08,121
It's,
yeah,

2700
02:04:08,121 --> 02:04:10,460
for the,
the risk of getting another one the same

2701
02:04:10,460 --> 02:04:11,540
day.
It's actually very high.

2702
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:13,550
Wow.
So once you shut off,

2703
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:16,460
shut off again.
So you have to wait at least the

2704
02:04:16,461 --> 02:04:19,220
following day to get back into water the
next day.

2705
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:22,850
I think I did,
it was the day after I really want to go

2706
02:04:22,851 --> 02:04:26,240
back in the water as soon as possible.
Just jumped back on the horse.

2707
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:30,350
So at night I was a little bit stressed
out and my friend gave me some Kratom

2708
02:04:30,351 --> 02:04:35,351
and it was fun.
That's stuff I used to think that stuff

2709
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:38,150
that Kratom was um,

2710
02:04:40,210 --> 02:04:44,280
I didn't think it was a drug.
I thought it was a mild stimulant.

2711
02:04:44,281 --> 02:04:47,910
I heard that people take it for pain,
but I thought that when they're taking

2712
02:04:47,911 --> 02:04:50,880
it for pain,
that they're not getting high,

2713
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:53,610
they're just taking,
it alleviates pain like advil or

2714
02:04:53,611 --> 02:04:56,130
something like that.
And then I took,

2715
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:58,890
I think I took eight of them,
eight or 10,

2716
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:03,360
which is a lot because I know Chris bell
takes like 10 every day.

2717
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:06,180
Yeah.
Powder mixed with like,

2718
02:05:06,330 --> 02:05:08,610
yeah,
this is just the powder in pill form.

2719
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:11,940
And I was high as fuck.
And I was like,

2720
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:13,860
oh,
okay.

2721
02:05:13,861 --> 02:05:16,080
Now I know why people are nervous about
this stuff.

2722
02:05:16,620 --> 02:05:20,160
I mean,
but the weird thing is I was high but my

2723
02:05:20,161 --> 02:05:24,000
body was very functional.
Like I was high but I wasn't

2724
02:05:24,001 --> 02:05:27,030
uncoordinated.
I wasn't knocking things over.

2725
02:05:27,260 --> 02:05:30,870
It wasn't that everything worked normal.
Like everything was,

2726
02:05:30,910 --> 02:05:33,270
was moving as I wanted it to move.

2727
02:05:33,510 --> 02:05:36,130
But I was like Whoa,
I fucking tripping.

2728
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:41,180
It is an opiate.
It operates on your opiate receptors and

2729
02:05:41,181 --> 02:05:43,110
some sort of strange way,
which is one of the reasons why they're

2730
02:05:43,111 --> 02:05:45,210
making the argument that it should be
illegal,

2731
02:05:45,211 --> 02:05:48,570
but is if,
if any opioid is legal,

2732
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:52,940
it should be that one because it helps
people tremendously with addiction

2733
02:05:52,950 --> 02:05:56,280
tremendously with pain.
It doesn't seem to be toxic to the point

2734
02:05:56,281 --> 02:06:00,750
where it can kill you or it's very,
very rare that it does.

2735
02:06:01,290 --> 02:06:04,590
It seems to operate in a completely
different way than any other opiate and

2736
02:06:04,591 --> 02:06:06,690
like I said,
even though I was definitely high,

2737
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:10,080
like I was definitely under the
influence of something.

2738
02:06:10,410 --> 02:06:11,970
Nobody,
I don't think anybody knew.

2739
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:14,070
I mean I could have conversations with
people,

2740
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:15,890
but in the back of my head I was like,
oh,

2741
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:19,170
hi.
I'm talking to people.

2742
02:06:19,171 --> 02:06:21,840
And it was all totally normal.
I wasn't driving,

2743
02:06:21,841 --> 02:06:23,670
but if I was driving I think I'd be
fine.

2744
02:06:23,671 --> 02:06:24,600
I'm fine.
I was fine.

2745
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:26,280
Walk,
I think even worked out.

2746
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:28,650
I think yeah,
it's just,

2747
02:06:29,190 --> 02:06:31,920
it's just operates in a very different
way.

2748
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:33,720
It's um,
I've never,

2749
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:36,750
I mean I've,
I've had my knee operation,

2750
02:06:37,020 --> 02:06:40,890
I had one of my knee operations.
They gave me a morphine button,

2751
02:06:41,150 --> 02:06:43,440
like when I was in the hospital,
like they said,

2752
02:06:43,441 --> 02:06:45,660
if you want morphine,
just press that button and it'll give

2753
02:06:45,661 --> 02:06:48,980
you some morphine.
I fucking hate that guy.

2754
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:53,940
Once he,
once you get high off the morphine and

2755
02:06:53,941 --> 02:06:57,570
you're in the hospital was great.
Keep pressing the button and the pain of

2756
02:06:57,571 --> 02:06:59,130
the knees.
It was on.

2757
02:06:59,131 --> 02:07:01,320
Um,
also my knee was on this motion machine

2758
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:02,850
right after the,
uh,

2759
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:06,660
the surgery was done.
They put me on this machine that extends

2760
02:07:06,661 --> 02:07:10,020
and contracts your name,
brings it back and forth and that's not

2761
02:07:10,021 --> 02:07:13,900
comfortable,
but when you hit that morphine is fun.

2762
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:16,560
But other than that I never really have
had opiates,

2763
02:07:16,561 --> 02:07:17,400
I don't think,
except

2764
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:22,860
they gave me a pain pill prescription.
I don't remember what kind it was.

2765
02:07:22,861 --> 02:07:25,110
It was Vicodin or percocet or one of
those.

2766
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:29,790
I took it once and I hated it.
It just made me feel really stupid.

2767
02:07:30,030 --> 02:07:34,110
Like I just remember thinking my brain's
just really dull and I still could feel

2768
02:07:34,111 --> 02:07:35,890
the pain.
I just didn't care.

2769
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:37,600
It was weird,
you know.

2770
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:40,180
So those morphine buttons are very
dangerous.

2771
02:07:40,210 --> 02:07:42,800
When I got my permission,
I keep us in the button too.

2772
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,050
Is that,
that it was really fun.

2773
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:45,550
I did.
It told me,

2774
02:07:45,551 --> 02:07:46,780
well,
it's time to go home.

2775
02:07:46,781 --> 02:07:49,270
And I stood up and I fell right on my
face.

2776
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:51,160
I had a complete faceplant.
Really?

2777
02:07:51,220 --> 02:07:53,350
Yeah,
like an actual complete face plant.

2778
02:07:53,510 --> 02:07:55,500
Oh,
what were you in the hospital for?

2779
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:57,500
I was a earn yum.

2780
02:07:58,350 --> 02:08:01,080
Hernia.
And they didn't ask you or how many

2781
02:08:01,081 --> 02:08:02,850
times you press that button,
Valentine?

2782
02:08:02,930 --> 02:08:05,340
They did.
They definitely did seem to have taking

2783
02:08:05,341 --> 02:08:06,730
into consideration my weight.

2784
02:08:07,810 --> 02:08:08,621
Oh yeah.
Right.

2785
02:08:08,621 --> 02:08:10,960
You're trying to.
Well why wouldn't they ask you how many

2786
02:08:10,961 --> 02:08:12,910
times you press the button before they
let you get up?

2787
02:08:12,970 --> 02:08:13,810
I,
I don't know.

2788
02:08:13,811 --> 02:08:16,420
But I remembered a woman being like the
nerves being like,

2789
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:18,550
like you had,
you had a lot.

2790
02:08:18,551 --> 02:08:20,360
You show you one more,
you shoot that much.

2791
02:08:20,361 --> 02:08:22,720
If I was bringing in.

2792
02:08:25,290 --> 02:08:27,060
Well,
once you're under the influence of it,

2793
02:08:27,490 --> 02:08:29,070
imagine you don't really worry about it.

2794
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:30,120
Nah,
you know,

2795
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:31,793
until you pass out.

2796
02:08:32,290 --> 02:08:34,690
Well Listen Valentine.
I'm glad we did this.

2797
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:36,730
It was really fun.
I'm glad we had this conversation.

2798
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:37,900
I think,
like I said,

2799
02:08:37,901 --> 02:08:40,750
I think what you're trying to do with
your life is admirable.

2800
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:44,080
Life is short.
I wish more people would chase their

2801
02:08:44,081 --> 02:08:49,081
dreams and live their lives in a way
that they want to rather than just jump

2802
02:08:49,511 --> 02:08:50,890
into the fucking rat race.

2803
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:52,141
I'm,
I'm definitely,

2804
02:08:52,141 --> 02:08:54,150
definitely not regretting any second of
it.

2805
02:08:54,151 --> 02:08:58,260
So I'm happy I did that.
Thank you so much for having me here and

2806
02:08:58,650 --> 02:09:01,790
it's crazy how you came up.
I was asking a friend of mine from

2807
02:09:01,820 --> 02:09:05,400
podcast to listen.
Then he talked to me about yours and so

2808
02:09:05,401 --> 02:09:06,980
as I was sitting at a beach in the
Bahamas,

2809
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,910
then my friend that went to law school
with me,

2810
02:09:08,911 --> 02:09:09,744
it was like,
oh,

2811
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:11,670
you should listen to draw organ.
Podcast is awesome.

2812
02:09:11,671 --> 02:09:13,790
I look you up in instagram and I say,
you will follow me.

2813
02:09:13,810 --> 02:09:14,643
Was like,

2814
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:18,580
Nice.
There we go.

2815
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:19,810
My friend was like,
what?

2816
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:22,230
Yo Shit.
Well,

2817
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:24,340
we did it.
Thanks for doing this and I hope maybe

2818
02:09:24,341 --> 02:09:27,070
this opens up some doors for you and
some things happen.

2819
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:28,210
Well,
if people start,

2820
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:31,890
stop hiding behind their closed mind and
opinion.

2821
02:09:32,210 --> 02:09:35,400
I think so.
I think slowly but surely conversations

2822
02:09:35,401 --> 02:09:38,460
like this,
it'll open doors and change people's

2823
02:09:38,461 --> 02:09:40,860
perceptions and that's.
That's what I hope people got out of it.

2824
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:43,380
That's good.
If I have one message today is talk

2825
02:09:43,381 --> 02:09:45,200
about it,
know where your food comes from and

2826
02:09:45,201 --> 02:09:46,970
don't be.
Don't be scared to see what's going on

2827
02:09:47,390 --> 02:09:50,840
and live the life to the way you want,
and that's what you're doing.

2828
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,070
Oh yeah.
Get Out of your comfort zone because you

2829
02:09:53,071 --> 02:09:55,320
never going to discover the person you
are this thing in there.

2830
02:09:55,780 --> 02:09:56,110
Boom.
