1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,210
The Joe Rogan experience is that you and
Rodney dangerfield.

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,750
Did you double as Rodney?
I did double hip a few times,

3
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:08,460
but movie was this.
Oh God.

4
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:11,940
A couple of TV shows I had.
It was a picture of you guys up there.

5
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:12,890
What's that?
Dad?

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,920
Can you say?
Uh,

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,771
yeah,
he,

8
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:15,870
uh,
yeah,

9
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:18,750
we,
I was doing sword fighting then sword

10
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,770
fighting.
Oh yeah,

11
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:21,300
definitely him.
And uh,

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,240
he was quite a character,
quite a character.

13
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,230
He would always leave his pants zipped
and um,

14
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,400
so I had uh,
one of the actors say,

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,370
Hey,
his pants,

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,030
he'd go up and he says I'm getting air
conditioning.

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,200
Don't bother me.
And he just did it as a square of a

18
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:42,440
joke.
Right.

19
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,510
With like the robes and stuff is like
balls.

20
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:49,120
And I've talked about this before,
but I worked at Great Woods,

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,590
Concert Center in Mansfield,
Massachusetts when I was a kid.

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,350
I was a,
amongst the security personnel there.

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,430
And so I was backstage and I got to see
Rodney as he was preparing for a show.

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,800
He would just have a robot and nothing
else.

25
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,140
He was wearing slippers and he had a
robot.

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,110
And he was walking around back there,
this is before I'd ever done standup

27
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,250
comedy,
but I was like,

28
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:10,080
that guy is the shit.
Like,

29
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:11,070
look at him.
He's just,

30
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,580
he's literally as comfortable as you can
get.

31
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,620
He's wearing a bathrobe on purpose and
it's because he could,

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,760
you know,
he was like,

33
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,140
[inaudible],
I can whatever.

34
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm just gonna wear a bathrobe.
It's comfortable.

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,880
I like the way I love the way he does it
because he can because he keeps fucking.

36
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:29,460
Rodney did.
He knew he was Rodney dangerfield.

37
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,620
He never said anything and he played it
straight and apparently a super nice

38
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:36,960
guy,
like everybody I know that did business

39
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,850
with them or had any interactions with
them,

40
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,710
always came away from it.

41
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,880
Same Rodney.
He's a great guy.

42
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,340
My friend Jeff,
my manager,

43
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:46,370
Jeff,
he was with one of,

44
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:48,870
uh,
one of his clients was one of Rodney's

45
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:52,590
original comics on the Hbo Comedy Series
that he did.

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,620
And he said that Rodney was just the
best.

47
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:57,330
Just the coolest,
nicest guy.

48
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,060
But it happens all the time.
I know.

49
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:03,330
But what's worse than that are fucking
your sister having sex with your sister.

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,200
That's worth,
I think the victim.

51
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,600
There were consistent.
Wants it.

52
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,610
You want it?
I thought about that.

53
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:11,370
There's one.
I will go to my grave saying I've never

54
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:13,350
had sex with my sister.
That's a good move.

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,420
Yeah.
There's some things you want to keep off

56
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:17,790
the resume.
That would be.

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,350
Well,
you don't even want to do it and then

58
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:20,520
go,
well that was a mistake.

59
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,190
Never do that again because you can't
really erase it.

60
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,840
Just kind of fucked man.

61
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,800
Because like isn't like learning like
one of the most important parts of life.

62
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,780
Like shouldn't you be allowed to fuck
up?

63
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,120
But you can't.
There's certain fuck ups you can't make.

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
Like you can't be like,
you know a baby.

65
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:37,970
I want to marry you.
I want to marry you too.

66
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,990
But I gotta tell you this one thing I
know,

67
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:42,720
I know this is not going to change
anything because we're meant to be with

68
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:44,550
each other,
but I fucked my cousin.

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,920
Your wife's going to be like,
what?

70
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,840
Why don't you fuck your cousin?
Wait a minute.

71
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,160
Which cousin?
Guy,

72
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,290
how far?
Wait,

73
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:51,570
wait,
Whoa,

74
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,030
whoa.
I fucked my cousin Mike.

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,620
How far was the,
is it a first cousin or is it a uh,

76
00:02:58,621 --> 00:02:59,840
yeah,
it'd to be a first cousin.

77
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,440
Was your second cousin?
That's it's gay sex.

78
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,230
Um,
I think no one's going to be happy with

79
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:06,220
you,
you know,

80
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,710
if your wife's not happy that you fucked
your cousin.

81
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,540
But this is the,
that was a joke brody.

82
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,210
But if it's straight trash,
my aunt antlers.

83
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,350
If it's straight,
it's straight sex.

84
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:21,910
I think I'm the second cousin is
actually like legal,

85
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,740
like you can not only fuck them,
you can marry them,

86
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:24,574
right?
Yeah.

87
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,450
Lewis first cousin.
Can I ask you a question?

88
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,120
Not,
you're not supposed to.

89
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,700
It's been on my mind and I know you
probably don't want to talk about it

90
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,410
because it was brought.
Oh well thanks for bringing it up on the

91
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:36,630
Internet.
What was brought up in it?

92
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,840
Well,
I'm just being real.

93
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,010
Who's brought up in you?
I think you were uneasy with it.

94
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:43,570
It was an ice house.
Chronical.

95
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,990
I'm.
Why would you bring it up again?

96
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,720
Because I heard Joe talked about gay
sex.

97
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:52,570
Like I have to make it clear.
I'm not into that.

98
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,670
Oh,
why do you have to make that clear?

99
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,360
Because I get hassled for it.
Sometimes it goes back to you again.

100
00:03:58,361 --> 00:03:59,710
Brody notice,
well,

101
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,720
going back to him and gay sex.
Apparently you can have sex with your

102
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,010
cousin.
It's legal.

103
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,300
What of your cousins?
A transsexual than a.

104
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,310
it's even more legal.
Depends if you're a.

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
If you're telling someone who writes for
Salon,

106
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:18,820
you're in a few girls that have been
attracted to their cousins,

107
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:22,520
but they always use the excuse.
They're not blood related and they've

108
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,321
well done.
Yeah,

109
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,660
that's not real.
I wouldn't have sex with a relative.

110
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,210
Just not into it,
but I think people have done it

111
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:30,610
throughout history.
I think it's kind of sick.

112
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,820
Why you don't see them that often?
I just think it's sick day.

113
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,280
I think incest is a sickening thing and
I'm sorry it's happened to some young

114
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:42,730
girls or kids or whatever.
I mean it would've been thing.

115
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,590
What if it's a cousin that you really
enjoy?

116
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,150
I think a cousin is too close,
but what of it?

117
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,070
Look what if that cousin is the perfect
person for you?

118
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,410
What if you know it does.
It doesn't make sense,

119
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:57,470
but you know what the heart wants,
what it wants brody and then one that's

120
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,310
not normal.
And so if you look at the way we treat

121
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,560
[inaudible],
why the fuck would we ever expect

122
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:03,030
anybody to

123
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,340
be nice to us?
I used to exercise the analogy of um,

124
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,560
of aliens with the younger trainers all
the time.

125
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,280
I'd say,
look,

126
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,880
we're aliens to these animals.
You need to make this animal's

127
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:19,881
environment as comfortable as possible.
Bearing in mind always we are aliens.

128
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,413
Just,
you know what I mean?

129
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,180
That's part of relating to the animals
which is or thing like that.

130
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:25,290
You're just like,
wait a second,

131
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,160
like I got to start being nicer because
if an alien comes down,

132
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,450
I don't want that.
I don't want.

133
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:30,770
It

134
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,630
sounds like it's a stupid thing to say
like it's one of those who's your

135
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,930
target.
Again,

136
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,410
people like automatically go goofy with
it.

137
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:42,300
But the reality is it's actually,
it's the right analogy because we really

138
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:46,770
are aliens in the world and we're
obviously supposedly intelligent.

139
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,470
We're obviously intelligent enough to
figure out how to get them.

140
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,930
We're intelligent enough to figure out
how to train them,

141
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:54,380
put them in tents,
put them in tanks rather.

142
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,670
Have all these people come to see him.
We're obviously intelligent.

143
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:58,210
Have to film them.
They

144
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,740
can tell there's a lot of shit going on
that they don't do,

145
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,330
but they've got to be like,
God,

146
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,800
you guys are dicks.
Like,

147
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:05,960
why are you holding onto me?
Like we don't.

148
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:06,800
Hold on.
We don't.

149
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,120
We don't,
we don't do that.

150
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,940
I think we killed things,
but we don't hold onto them.

151
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,610
I think that's when the frustration
level start boiling for these animals

152
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:16,250
because when they're first,
when they first arrived here as a green

153
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,480
animal,
if there.

154
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,500
I mean the bottom line is it depends if
they're a good candidate for captivity,

155
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,170
but they learned real fast that,
okay,

156
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:27,770
that's the hand that feeds me.
Like I wanna I wanna I want to develop

157
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:30,800
this relationship if you will,
which is an relationship of abiding by

158
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:32,570
this person's race.
Right?

159
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,970
So and again,
goodwill,

160
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:35,540
the animals and the other ones that are
just like,

161
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,370
this ain't for me.
They're,

162
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,273
they're,
they're,

163
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,640
they're cutting out and there's nothing
you can do.

164
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:41,870
I mean,
you pull blood from them,

165
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,210
you check that blood.
There's nothing wrong with them.

166
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:46,160
This animal's not sick.
Why isn't it eating?

167
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,730
And then days later,
why is this animal dead did not want to

168
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:51,950
be in captivity.
They just starve themselves to death.

169
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,140
I've seen it so many times.
Wow.

170
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,460
The will to live loss.
