1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,210
The joe rogan experience,
is that you and Rodney Dangerfield?

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,750
Did you double as Rodney?
I did double Hib a few times.

3
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:08,460
What movie was this?
Oh God,

4
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:11,940
a couple of TV shows I had.
This is a picture of you guys up there.

5
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:13,440
What's that guide?
Can you say it?

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,610
Ah,
yeah,

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,201
yeah,
we,

8
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:19,260
I was doing sword fighting then sword
fighting.

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,570
Oh yeah,
definitely him.

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,100
And uh,
he was quite a character,

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,160
quite a character.
He would always leave his pants zip.

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,270
And um,
I had,

13
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:31,010
uh,
one of the actors in them.

14
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,621
I'm saying,
Hey,

15
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:34,320
his pants inside zip.
He'd go up and he says,

16
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:37,350
I'm getting air conditioning.
Don't bother me.

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,800
And he just did it as a swerve,
a joke.

18
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,180
He wants to write with like the robes
and stuff.

19
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,310
[inaudible] like balls and why?
I've talked about this before,

20
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:51,390
but I worked at Great Woods,
Concert Center and Mansfield,

21
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:52,020
Massachusetts.

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,700
When I was a kid,
I was a,

23
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,180
amongst the security personnel there.
And so I was backstage and I got to see

24
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:01,410
Rodney as he was preparing for a show.
He would just have a robe on and nothing

25
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:03,540
else.
And we were wearing slippers and he had

26
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,340
a robe on and he was walking around back
there.

27
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,530
This is before I'd ever done standup
comedy,

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,600
but I was like,
that guy is the shit.

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,640
Like,
look at him.

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,410
He's just,
he's literally as comfortable as you can

31
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,750
get.
He's wearing a bathrobe on purpose and

32
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:17,250
it's because he could,
you know,

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,170
he was like,
cause I can whatever,

34
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm just gonna wear a bathrobe.
It's comfortable.

35
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:25,530
I liked the way,
I love the way he does it because he

36
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:27,890
can,
because he keeps fucking Ronnie did.

37
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:29,900
He knew he was Rodney dangerfield.
Hell,

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,430
he didn't have any said anything and he
played it straight.

39
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,960
And apparently a super nice guy.
Like everybody I know that did business

40
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,850
with them or had any interactions with
them,

41
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,100
always came away from it.
Same Rodney,

42
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,650
he's a great guy.
My friend Jeff,

43
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:45,780
my manager Jeff,
he was with,

44
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:46,411
uh,
one of,

45
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:48,840
uh,
one of his clients was one of Rodney's

46
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:49,980
original,
um,

47
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,320
uh,
comics on the Hbo Comedy Series that he

48
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,700
did.
And uh,

49
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:56,580
he said that Rodney was just the best,
just the coolest,

50
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:58,590
nicest guy.
But it happens all the time.

51
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,750
I know.
But what's worse than that are fucking

52
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:03,860
your sister having sex with your sister.
That's worse.

53
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,420
I think so.
I victim there.

54
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,350
Where's your sister wants it?
You want it?

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,830
I thought about that.
There's one I will go to my grave saying

56
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,350
I've never had sexual my sister.
That's a good move.

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,420
Yeah,
there's some things you want to keep off

58
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:17,800
the resume.
Yeah,

59
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:19,230
that would be,
well you don't even want to do it and

60
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:20,520
then go while I was a mistake.

61
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,190
Never do that again cause you can't
really erase it.

62
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,150
Which is kind of fucked man.
Because like isn't it like learning like

63
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:30,810
one of the most important parts of life?
Like shouldn't you be allowed to fuck up

64
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,120
but you can't.
There's certain fuck ups you can't make.

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
Like you can't be like,
you know a baby.

66
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:38,010
I want to marry you,
I want to marry you too.

67
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:39,890
But I gotta tell you this one thing I
don't,

68
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,720
I know this is not going to change
anything cause we're meant to be with

69
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:44,550
each other,
but I fucked my cousin.

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,920
Your wife's going to be like,
what?

71
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,870
Why did you fuck your cousin?
Wait a minute.

72
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,210
Which cousin?
Guy.

73
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,131
How far,
wait,

74
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:51,964
wait,
whoa.

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,390
I fucked my cousin Mike.
Huh?

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,510
How far was the,
is it a first cousin or is it uh,

77
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,871
uh,
yeah,

78
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,340
it'd be,
have to be a first guy then it was a

79
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:01,160
second cousin.

80
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,670
Well if it's gay sex,
um,

81
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,440
I think no one's going to be happy with
you.

82
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,740
You know your wife's not happy that you
fucked your cousin.

83
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,560
But it,
this is the,

84
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,400
that was a joke brody.
But if it's a straight ranch,

85
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,080
my aunt works.
If it's straight

86
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,980
it's straight sex.
I think.

87
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:21,400
Um,
the second cousin is actually like

88
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,080
legal.
Like you can not only fuck them,

89
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:24,040
you can marry him,
right?

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,040
Yeah.
First cousin.

91
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,580
Can I ask you a question?
Joel?

92
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:30,130
You're not,
you're not supposed to.

93
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,700
It's been on my mind and I know you
probably don't want to talk about it

94
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,410
cause it was broad.
Oh well thanks for bringing it up on the

95
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:36,460
Internet.
What was brought up?

96
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,890
Well I'm just being real.
Who's brought up in,

97
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,010
not you.
I think you are uneasy with it.

98
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:44,650
It was an ice house chronical.
Um,

99
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,990
why would you bring it up again?

100
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,720
Well,
cause I heard Joe talked about gay sex.

101
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:52,570
Like I have to make it clear.
I'm not into that.

102
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,670
Oh,
why do you have to make that clear?

103
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,360
Because I get hassled for it.
Sometimes it goes back to you again,

104
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:01,700
brody notice,
well it's going back to him and gay sex.

105
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,080
Apparently you can have sex with your
cousin.

106
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,430
It's legal.
What else of your cousins?

107
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,280
A transsexual then?
Uh,

108
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,260
it's even more legal.
Depends if you're,

109
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,080
if you're telling someone who writes for
salon,

110
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:18,790
you're in a few girls that have been
attracted to their cousins,

111
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,700
but they always use the excuse.
They're not blood related and they've

112
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:23,321
all done.
Yeah,

113
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,690
that's not real.
I wouldn't have sex with a relative,

114
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,210
just not into it.
But I think people who have done it

115
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:30,640
throughout history,
I think it's kind of sick.

116
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,430
Why would,
if you don't see them that often?

117
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,660
I just sick.
It's sick.

118
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,280
I think incest is a sickening thing and
I'm sorry it's happened to some young

119
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:42,430
girls or kids or whatever.
Made it would if it's a really good name

120
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:43,990
thing.
What if it's a cousin that you really

121
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:46,450
enjoy?
I think it cousin is too close.

122
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,260
But what if it look,
what if that cousin is the perfect

123
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:52,210
person for you?
What did you know it does.

124
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,670
It doesn't make sense.
But you know what the heart wants what

125
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:57,880
it wants,
Brodie and then one good and that's not

126
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,310
normal.
And so if you look at the way we treat

127
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:02,530
orchids,
why the fuck would we ever expect

128
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:03,030
anybody to

129
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,450
be nice to us?
I used to exercise the analogy of um,

130
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,560
of aliens with the younger trainers all
the time.

131
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,280
I'd say,
look,

132
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,880
we're aliens to these animals.
You need to make this animal's

133
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:19,881
environment as comfortable as possible.
Bearing in mind always we are aliens.

134
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,420
Just,
you know what I mean?

135
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,540
That's part of relating to the animals,
which is,

136
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,690
are thinking like that.
You're just like,

137
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,090
wait a second.
Like I got it.

138
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:29,160
Start being nicer because if an alien
comes down,

139
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,130
I don't want that.
I don't want to be sounds as,

140
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,670
it's a stupid thing to say.

141
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,650
It's one of those,
are you talking about aliens?

142
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:37,320
Again,
people like automatically go goofy with

143
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:39,480
it,
but the reality is it's actually,

144
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,130
it's the right analogy because we really
are aliens in their world and we're

145
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,570
obviously supposedly intelligent where
obviously intelligent enough to figure

146
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:51,930
out how to get them when intelligent
enough to figure out how to train them,

147
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:54,120
put them in tents,
put them in tanks,

148
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,470
rather have all these people come to see
him.

149
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:57,440
We're obviously intelligent enough to
film them.

150
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,220
Theirs,
they

151
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,740
can tell there's a lot of shit going on
that they don't do,

152
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,330
but they've gotta be like,
God,

153
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,770
you guys are decks.
Like,

154
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:06,530
why are you holding on to me?
Like we don't hold on it.

155
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,131
We don't.
We don't.

156
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:08,150
We don't.
We don't do that.

157
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,970
I think we kill things,
but we don't hold onto them.

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,310
I think that's when the frustration
levels started boiling for these

159
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:14,570
animals.
Cause when they're first there,

160
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,480
when they first arrived,
he has a green animal if there,

161
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,750
I mean the bottom line is,
it depends if they're a good candidate

162
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:23,810
for captivity,
but they've learned real fast that,

163
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,430
okay,
that's the hand that feeds me.

164
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,920
Like I wanna,
I wanna I want to develop this

165
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:28,940
relationship,
if you will,

166
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:31,490
which is in relationship of like abiding
by this person's,

167
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,570
right,
right.

168
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,970
So then again,
goodwill,

169
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:37,160
the animals and the other ones that are
just like the same for me.

170
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,060
There,
they're there,

171
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,670
they're cutting out and there's nothing
you can do.

172
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:41,900
I mean,
you pull blood from them,

173
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,210
you checked up blood.
There's nothing wrong with them.

174
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:46,190
This animal's not sick.
Why isn't it eating?

175
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,760
And then days later,
why is the Sanama debt did not want to

176
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:51,980
be in captivity.
They just starve themselves to death.

177
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,380
I've seen it so many times.
Wow.

178
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,520
The will to live Lawson.

179
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:56,530
Okay.
