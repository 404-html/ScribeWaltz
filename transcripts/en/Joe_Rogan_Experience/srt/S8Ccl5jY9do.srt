1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,490
I want to show you a couple of things
on Joe and some of the things that I've

2
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:12,324
been working on now,

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,220
like I mentioned the door,

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,040
my whole,

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,870
my main direction in Jujitsu is always
been to major Jitsu better in MMA,

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,763
in the UFC.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,930
The UFC is what got me into
Jujitsu when I felt you have seals.

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,840
That was the most amazing thing ever.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,680
And then,

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,101
you know,

11
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:30,910
immediately I started doing Jujitsu.

12
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,250
Quite is my favorite fighter.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,330
Anybody who did anything,

14
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:33,771
what you did.

15
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:35,490
So I was going from always been,

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,710
oh and then like it's funny because you,

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,320
and one way some,

18
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:42,600
a lot of people in that
community see you as a bed.

19
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,160
Why did you see how the Guy Stopped?

20
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,650
[inaudible] has got
against us but I don't see,

21
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:48,350
I never saw that too.

22
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,410
I always felt like you trying to create
your own routines and others trying to

23
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:55,440
help to Jensen and that's all it was,

24
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:55,711
is I,

25
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:56,100
I,

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,933
I got,

27
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:57,720
uh,

28
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,970
I got tired of seeing like in UFC 13,

29
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:00,511
15,

30
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:02,940
17 tired of seeing Jujitsu guys just,

31
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,531
you know,

32
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:03,930
um,

33
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,660
when Jerry Bolander Font,

34
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,030
uh,

35
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,130
five years your shout,

36
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,020
I was like,

37
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,853
oh,

38
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,200
how was he?

39
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,400
How he was getting beat up when,

40
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:11,730
uh,

41
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,391
what had been eight,

42
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,560
I fought Matt Hughes.

43
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,371
Man,

44
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:19,020
that hurts so much because Jujitsu
was my life and I thought we got to do

45
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:21,030
something to fix this,

46
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,930
especially in the car.

47
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,291
Let me,

48
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:22,590
let me,

49
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,450
let me show you a little bit.

50
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,060
There's no,

51
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,750
the one thing,

52
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,321
pride too.

53
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:26,154
I saw him,

54
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,340
I saw him the just pulled
on like this for a second.

55
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,510
And that's when I thought,

56
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,051
Ooh,

57
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:32,310
that could be something there.

58
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,870
Because generally,

59
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:34,680
you know,

60
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,221
people would be,

61
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:35,821
you'd be quick.

62
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:38,220
You guys were doing like this
when there was headbutts right?

63
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,570
And then it headbutts came out.

64
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,170
So this became a good way to
survive from the punishment.

65
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,580
So from there,

66
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,270
um,

67
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,880
when I saw him some do this and hold,

68
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,890
I decided to start bringing it
all up and really get use my legs.

69
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:52,870
How?

70
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,050
Because with the key,

71
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,010
it's easy to control here,

72
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,090
control the posture,

73
00:01:57,091 --> 00:02:00,180
but hard to control the posh and
your legs keep slipping down.

74
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,260
You want to go high guard.

75
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,100
So my,

76
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,790
my host,

77
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,480
my host system started
becoming this kind of stuff.

78
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:09,090
Like there's no way he
could touch my face here.

79
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,100
There's no way.

80
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,480
And I see chrome again,

81
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,121
Shinier EOP.

82
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:12,480
So,

83
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,180
and even Marcello sometimes
he comes here to hold,

84
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:15,580
you know,

85
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,413
to hold up man.

86
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,760
So the rubber guard,

87
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:18,541
I don't know if you heard that,

88
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,140
but it's all about just
getting into this position.

89
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,230
If his arms up here is awful care,

90
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
I'll attack this on,

91
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,520
I'll even go like this and there's no
way he can hit me and there's no way,

92
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,083
um,

93
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:34,530
uh,

94
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,780
he can pull out and stand up again.

95
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,960
So that became my obsession is to develop
a guard where they can't get up and

96
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:46,650
run away and being able to prevent him.

97
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,820
You can't elbow me right here.

98
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,380
Soon as I cross both these legs,

99
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,660
there's no way you can help me.

100
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,900
Is it possible?

101
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,980
So,

102
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,813
um,

103
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,953
that's,

104
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,780
that's what I developed
in those for Jujitsu.

105
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,010
And like you said,

106
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,500
the judge would come here and do,

107
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,340
a lot of them took that as,

108
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:03,791
oh,

109
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,760
he thinks he knows more than us.

110
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,541
Look at him,

111
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,810
he's turning his back on due dates.

112
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:13,690
And the reason I dropped the Guid is
cause I felt that every second you grabbed

113
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:14,980
the call and grab the sleeve,

114
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,800
that's not the same fighting stance MMA.

115
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,993
So I thought,

116
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,511
you know,

117
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:20,344
let's look,

118
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,610
I didn't drop the game
to say fuck you Jujitsu.

119
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,251
It was a,

120
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,020
you know what for Nma,

121
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,270
the gives them how good we have to,

122
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,730
the fighting stance has to be the same.

123
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,870
When we trap,

124
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:35,890
when we train grappling with
no punches or with punches,

125
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,780
it has to be the same stance,

126
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:38,770
the same final stance.

127
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,820
So based on what,

128
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,381
again,

129
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:46,280
when I saw you and hence or doing it had
to come from that defensive posture and

130
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:47,950
their old book so you don't get hit.

131
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,060
Then the legs come up.

132
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,440
Then you started talking while you
control them while you keep them from

133
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,360
standing up and go and stand up again.

134
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,420
Because there was a fight with
Fabiana [inaudible] and Dave Fernanda,

135
00:03:58,421 --> 00:03:59,254
UFC,

136
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,580
UFC 20 something.

137
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,521
We're Fabiana,

138
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:04,960
he had a good arm bar from the
guard so he fights day for night.

139
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,100
He was a pretty good
rustler Fabiana he had,

140
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:08,950
could not take him down.

141
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,410
So they get against the
cage and Fabiano here,

142
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,490
which are full guard,

143
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,290
pulled him into his garb and then put the
feet on the hips and two to set up for

144
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:17,771
the arm bar.

145
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:18,670
Cause that's how he does it.

146
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,040
And then Dave and I just
stood up and just walked away,

147
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,163
do it again.

148
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,800
So then Fabiana here gets up,

149
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,420
he did it five times in that fight.

150
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,560
He jumps garden,

151
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,430
pulls him down.

152
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,610
But as soon as he opened up his
legs and put his feet on the hips,

153
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,020
Dave Linn ever just to do
it again and it gave him,

154
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,960
and I ended up winning.

155
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,000
So for me,

156
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,833
I was like,

157
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,850
that's a problem because
they don't have to be on top.

158
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,000
If you pull guard because
you can't take the fire down.

159
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,110
He doesn't have to stay there.

160
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,190
As soon as you opened the guard,

161
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:48,250
you're going to get up
just like a Allister over.

162
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,770
And when he fought five,

163
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,160
five,

164
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,930
you Superdome [inaudible]
pulled them in his guard.

165
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,670
But as soon as he opened it,

166
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,871
Alister said,

167
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:56,320
come on,

168
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,340
I'm not going to go down there.

169
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,503
So it became a,

170
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,560
okay,

171
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,393
that's a problem.

172
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,590
We're going to have to
have them in the guard.

173
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,000
If we can't wrestle low,

174
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,930
we have to pull guard and then
keep them from standing up.

175
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,490
So the clinch became,

176
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,390
in my opinion,

177
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,800
the most important thing,

178
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,290
cause you've gotta be able to
coach him and not only him,

179
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,020
so they don't stand up but conscience.

180
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:16,930
So they don't hit you.

181
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,020
And then you have to hop off
offense from that clench.

182
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,650
So anytime someone would train the
key and have the call in the sleep,

183
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,540
that's not working on the club quarters.

184
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,460
So that's like you're not working on it.

185
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,440
So that's why we're seeing all these
black Delsi come in five or after fighting

186
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:31,991
or all these guys,

187
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,130
American talking black,

188
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:33,964
the black man,

189
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,590
and then when they're on their back,

190
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,450
they're not used to
offense from the defense.

191
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:42,530
The best defense of position it.

192
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,440
They just don't ever work there.

193
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:44,951
They think,

194
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:45,191
okay,

195
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:46,270
I'm just going to train your game,

196
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,390
grabbed the call and grab the sleeve and
then it's going to somehow work itself

197
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,500
out somehow.

198
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,020
It's going to work itself out
when it doesn't work like that.

199
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:53,860
Like if,

200
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,090
if you're practicing,

201
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,800
you're fighting stance like this,

202
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,670
but in a fight you have to go here,

203
00:05:58,671 --> 00:05:59,504
it's going to be different.

204
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,260
You should have been
practicing like of course.

205
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,820
Of course.

206
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,580
That was my philosophy and
everything I've ever done,

207
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,420
every,

208
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,800
every little tweak I'd ever done.

209
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:10,120
Did you Dentsu some people in the Jiu
Jitsu community got me and he goes,

210
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,053
number one guy,

211
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,830
he thinks that I'm doing it just to
think that I'm the best guy and that I'm

212
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:16,820
better than Jujitsu.

213
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,160
Keep that.

214
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,190
Always look.

215
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:20,030
He dropped the key.

216
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,880
He hits you gypsy.

217
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,130
He's betraying and like
it's not about that.

218
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,051
He even calls you,

219
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:24,450
I'm talking.

220
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,080
He said [inaudible],

221
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,953
what's he doing?

222
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,870
He's taken off the guy.

223
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:29,030
You gave him a black down here.

224
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,730
Cause I said if I ever teach Jujitsu,

225
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,810
I'm going to teach without the
gate just to do my part for MMA.

226
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,570
You can keep the gate and you can train
that you need to do the mood in the

227
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:38,811
house.

228
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:43,811
But some I need to focus and
dedicate myself to try and to try.

229
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,930
I'm trying to approve Jujitsu and MMA.

230
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,960
That's all I was ever tried for Jujitsu,

231
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,730
not for Samba and not pro wrestling.

232
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:53,510
I'm for striking.

233
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,230
I'm Jujitsu,

234
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,063
pure blood,

235
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,143
pure blood.

236
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,540
And so that is the misconception that
it has it around and they're saying,

237
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:02,181
oh,

238
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:03,270
he's changing names.

239
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,690
He's,

240
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,140
he's taking moves and changing the names.

241
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,561
Look,

242
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:07,910
that's the rest of the move to twister.

243
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,080
He calls it the twister.

244
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,030
It's actually the,

245
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,150
the wrestlers guillotine and well I didn't
change the mood Hicken and John John

246
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,650
Changed it because I
would come in and I say,

247
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,560
this is a guilty I learned in
wrestling and they were like,

248
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,860
there was already a killer team.

249
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:20,720
That's the front headlock.

250
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,440
That's a good,

251
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,990
so they started calling it twister.

252
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,390
I don't know.

253
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,223
It's not the twister.

254
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,810
So then later people started saying,

255
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,201
look,

256
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:30,230
he changes a wrestling
move and he's a fraud.

257
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,010
He's taken moves and changing them and
he's making all these new facilities

258
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,030
positions and changing.

259
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:38,480
Then the only names that I invent,

260
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:43,460
like the names that I came up with were
moves or transitions that didn't have

261
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:44,294
names.

262
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,440
So in my,

263
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,423
in my brain,

264
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,630
I can teach better and I could
learn better than every transition,

265
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,800
every position,

266
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,030
not even if it's a submission.

267
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,380
Every transition,

268
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,440
every set up has a name so
that I could with my students,

269
00:07:57,441 --> 00:08:00,080
I can get on the phone and we have a
language that we're talking to them.

270
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,973
Oh.

271
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,180
Otherwise if you're on the phone,

272
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,630
you're going,

273
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,361
you know that one,

274
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:06,650
who would he put your hand on hip
and like what mood you have to show,

275
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:07,270
you have to show that.

276
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,420
Like,

277
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know.

278
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,833
So for me,

279
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,490
Americans like naming everything.

280
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,500
So that's what,

281
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,400
that's what the naming process came in.

282
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,110
I came up with all these crazy names,

283
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:19,220
these stupid names because it
was not until he came back down.

284
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,590
And then my goal is to
pull my form over here.

285
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,540
Now there's more pressure now,

286
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,370
right here,

287
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,670
very hard to do anything.

288
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,480
And um,

289
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,200
the next step was to come
here and then hug right here.

290
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,780
And then if you're going
to punch with this here,

291
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,290
I'm going to be ready already and I'm
already holding the foot and I can control

292
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,124
right here,

293
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,300
very hard to do anything.

294
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,550
And then I'm right here.

295
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,790
This is where I'm at.

296
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,900
You need flexibility.

297
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,150
And then if you join to
stand up with this leg,

298
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,210
I went to figure four here
and then right here it's over.

299
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,500
You'd be very hard.

300
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,680
You feel that,

301
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,183
so that,

302
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,780
so that is a way to make it so that
you're defensive and they can't punch you.

303
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,680
And um,

304
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,210
I'm actually going for the kill.

305
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,830
I'm not being defensive.

306
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:05,820
I'm going for the Co.

307
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,680
And in my experience,

308
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,180
the bigger the government wants 60,

309
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,710
the bigger the guy is.

310
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:12,270
If he's won 85,

311
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,170
one 90,

312
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,010
and he's a wrestler.

313
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,480
In my experience,

314
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,730
the only thing that works is to get here
in time and hug that I'm right here.

315
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:25,050
This is an old hot right
cause we've very hard for,

316
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,100
for anybody to do it.

317
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,670
Then once this book comes
over here and then here,

318
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,510
very hard really to do anything there.

319
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:34,981
That's the goal.

320
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:36,000
And it's really not that hard.

321
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,250
I played this game against my Tufts
students on the day on a daily basis.

322
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,030
So the best thing for you to do is
keep both your hands on the chest,

323
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,153
both of them.

324
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,771
And then yes,

325
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:50,350
that's that's cause now you have an
opportunity to maybe posture you do.

326
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,290
So what I want to do
and leave you these fan,

327
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,430
now you can't punch me and now you can't
posture because you only can do it with

328
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:57,264
one heart.

329
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,433
They understand.

330
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,940
And then once I grabbed the
other leg here and clear here,

331
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,153
very hard,

332
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,090
you can't punch and then I
can attack this on her hair.

333
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,133
I'm looking at this one.

334
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,670
I could take this arm this way
or I could just right here.

335
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,940
You can't defend with your right arm
because I've already tracked it and then

336
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:18,420
we're here.

337
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,230
This is my,

338
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,230
one of my go to arm ourselves and then
if it all fails and a lot of times we

339
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:24,931
just ended up here.

340
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,160
Then we had the finding from here,

341
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,650
like you survived everything
and then now we're here.

342
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,780
I'm looking to come back to hook here.

343
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,220
I'm looking to come back to the
cure and take this or you roll.

344
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,380
And then this week,

345
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,660
because a lot of times it got one
guy will get there and he's like,

346
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,381
fuck that.

347
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:41,214
I'm just going to roll.

348
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,940
And then at the sweep and I go up and I
roll it too and I pass your guard at the

349
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:46,210
same time with that role.

350
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,600
But that's the last resort I'm trying to
grab to the neck that our first connect

351
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,443
the arm,

352
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,870
keep control in the way.

353
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,270
How on the next year I'm going to,

354
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,110
I'm going to go after their arm or putting
my foot over and hold onto your hat.

355
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,933
What a joke.

356
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,263
Oh,

357
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,213
I'm going to,

358
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,940
I'm going to try to get
this aren't on the bat.

359
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,930
If I can't get off the island on the mat,

360
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,720
then there's a different
things I can do here.

361
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,010
I can try to clear the neck anyways.

362
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,450
I been try to clear them.

363
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,950
If I can't clear the night,

364
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,100
then we can just stay here and then I
could punch here until yet they're going

365
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,520
[inaudible] yeah,

366
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,420
well he could stall it out.

367
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:34,530
People could smell some news.

368
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,120
They always didn't want to stay.

369
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,890
Especially now they want to stay here.

370
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,730
Yes.

371
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,690
So he did the recipes come
from the butcher heater's fine.

372
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,140
Yes,

373
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,531
yes,

374
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:44,100
yes.

375
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,600
Miss it.

376
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:44,820
This,

377
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,391
this comes from,

378
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:46,171
this is a patient,

379
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:47,004
a patient game.

380
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,190
So that's why I can still work
from here and I could still,

381
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,060
what I would do another may as punch
here until you and then Google.

382
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,963
Now we're here.

383
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,080
Right?

384
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,321
So,

385
00:11:56,321 --> 00:12:00,400
but the most important thing is to get
that hand on the map before the Lex come

386
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:00,730
up.

387
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,110
So anytime you're here
and I have the under hook,

388
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,010
that means whether I'm here or here,

389
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,170
that means all I got to do is bring this
up here and now that arm is right out

390
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,013
of the mix.

391
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,430
So when I'm rolling,

392
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,470
I'm always looking for that overlook.

393
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,460
Always.

394
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,230
As soon as I get this Oprah hook here,

395
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:17,950
boom.

396
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,360
These lectures that come in here,

397
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,250
they're going to be right here and then
fam right here and then because this

398
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:25,084
art,

399
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,640
so it's all come from the overall.

400
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,690
Even from butterfly card here,

401
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,220
if I'm here and butterfly guard,

402
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:33,340
all I got to do is release
and now I'm here and then,

403
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,870
and then there's a stacking.

404
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,160
You have to be patient.

405
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,090
Nothing's quick.

406
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,930
Am I fail?

407
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,980
You might pull out of it,

408
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,020
but then we go back to it again.

409
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,010
I was,

410
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,281
you know,

411
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:43,830
some guys pull out of sweaty.

412
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,170
It was just like a,

413
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,270
you're trying to take him down.

414
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,350
You didn't take him down.

415
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,873
You set it up again.

416
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,120
Trying to think to like where Joe,

417
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,780
it takes me four times to
get him in his own polite.

418
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:57,010
He's seen so much wrong.

419
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,020
He'll pull out and then
we have started again.

420
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,511
Boom.

421
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:02,800
He smashed me and then he pulls out
and let me start again and then boom,

422
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:03,581
like on the fourth one,

423
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:03,940
boom,

424
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,441
I caught him.

425
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:05,110
He puts on,

426
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,943
you don't have to bat,

427
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,120
so it's just like take down.

428
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:10,090
If you keep trying to take
a guy down and meanwhile,

429
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,500
even though it's failing,

430
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,650
you can't get hit because the way to
defendant is the stack stay tight and not

431
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:17,680
do anything.

432
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,610
The way to stop it,

433
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,750
it's don't punch because as soon as you
punch a mess at Max me out at one point,

434
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,430
your hands already on the map.

435
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:25,260
Boom.

436
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,040
The best analogy that you've ever made
about it is when you talked about head

437
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:29,730
kicks.

438
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,340
Like if you tried to teach
someone how to throw a head kick,

439
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,720
know I can't fucking kicks him out,

440
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:35,190
man.

441
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,330
How am I going to kick some of that?

442
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,720
But you're getting a guy who was like,

443
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,430
Maury Smith a great kickboxer.

444
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:39,991
It's easy,

445
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:42,630
but then it kicks them in because
they've done it so many times.

446
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,520
It becomes a part of
their natural movement.

447
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,550
Once you develop the type
of guard that he has,

448
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,780
I tell everybody,

449
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,460
if you don't roll with him,

450
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:52,170
you don't understand what's possible.

451
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,460
Once you roll with him,

452
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,840
his legs are like arms and they're moving
in positions that you don't come to

453
00:13:57,841 --> 00:14:01,140
expect a normal training
and until you experience it,

454
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,670
you don't know the possibilities.

455
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:04,890
I think that's the next level of MMA.

456
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,470
I think what he's doing
right now is going to be,

457
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:07,711
you know,

458
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:11,340
we're seeing all these new like wheel
kicks and new techniques and it's

459
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:12,174
striking.

460
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,490
That's the next thing
is his car techniques.

461
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:17,300
I really believe it all started
from watching Hanzo diversity.

462
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,151
That's all.

463
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:18,500
They're like,

464
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,333
Ooh

465
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,020
cause I was a high guard
player with the key.

466
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,183
No key,

467
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,180
the legs keep slipping
the let's leave some.

468
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:26,190
So it's hard to attack.

469
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,210
So then we're like,

470
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,010
Oh let's just keep the leg up here.

471
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,250
He's the,

472
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,250
the necessity to keep the light
glows and that matter is a really,

473
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,910
is it really effective?

474
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,773
Uh,

475
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,083
but again,

476
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,290
if the guy try to be defensive,

477
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,010
uh,

478
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,460
is hard for you I believe.

479
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:52,010
I believe you had combine some kinds

480
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,551
of strikes,

481
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:53,460
some kind of punishment.

482
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:53,690
Yes.

483
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,141
Your fee.

484
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:54,850
Yes.

485
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,040
We've was maybe to create
that kind of panic.

486
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:03,120
The show is the best day in day out
of those positions without struck.

487
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,470
So I was here,

488
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,490
I love the shoulder here.

489
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,343
I'm holding

490
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,100
this position right here.

491
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,170
If you could,

492
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,270
maybe I'll do it on Joe,

493
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:13,550
but if you could see this right here.

494
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,380
Again this is all you're going to keep it.

495
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,900
You're not going to let me have the arm
bar cause as soon as you straighten that

496
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,763
it's going to be tight.

497
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,640
So all I'm going to do is just throw
elbows rammed the perfect angle to come

498
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:23,990
down this anchor Russia

499
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,830
that's published and setting
up the arm bar and listen.

500
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,050
Very common and my,

501
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,640
and my style I have getting here,

502
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
I'm keeping this tight.

503
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,400
See this position right?

504
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,780
I call this muddy waters here and he
can't do anything and I have full away on

505
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:44,160
his elbow and the pump.

506
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,990
Take the arm.

507
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,160
This arm is out of Mexico.

508
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,053
This is tight.

509
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,970
So this is a position
I worked to get into.

510
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,730
This could take three minutes to get into,

511
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,540
but once I'm here it's over
now and slowly bit by bit.

512
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,830
I have to move this elbow and
cause how do you move that boy?

513
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,950
It's very hard.

514
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,270
I can't move into here.

515
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,170
Pop so hard.

516
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,260
He has good posture.

517
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,093
So why?

518
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,020
So what I need to do is to
get my form on this side,

519
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,510
cross my here I'm looking
at how I squeeze the elbows,

520
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,200
see how it's easier and then
I go back to this and that.

521
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,034
Here,

522
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,880
this is my on one move that I do all
the time and then once I'm here I don't

523
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:21,890
even need to bring the leg over the face.

524
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,240
I could just finish it right here.

525
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,670
If he has flexible arms then we take,

526
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,730
if I don't want to take a chance,

527
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,960
I know this way.

528
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,633
So interesting.

529
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,540
That's stuff that I
would love to show crop.

530
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,930
I would love to cause he's
already trying to do it.

531
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,130
He's already flexible.

532
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,330
I think that would be very
valuable in all my guys do this.

533
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,400
This is standard stuff that all,

534
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,020
I got some guys that are doing amazing.

535
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,540
Anytime I'm in the car,

536
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,490
the lights come up and
guys already in trouble.

537
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,853
She Aoki,

538
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,913
he got,

539
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,360
he's the one who uses it the most.

540
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,680
If you watch New York,

541
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,380
he just a very hot,

542
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,760
basic version of this.

543
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,050
I was in 2000 I was in
Japan in 2005 and um,

544
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,820
I showed off stuff.

545
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,170
He never seen it before.

546
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,690
Immediately starts
using it and his fights,

547
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,240
he starts trying on everybody.

548
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,750
And so just something that
I would love to show chrome,

549
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,100
I would love to.

550
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,330
I think I might be able just
in case he's in a bad spot,

551
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,460
if I the lesser of the
two on top of them might,

552
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,540
it might be an extra weapon that
made it a gay Wacko is good.

553
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,060
Yes.

554
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,050
When we go to [inaudible],

555
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,300
thank you very much for your
patience and thanks for your input.

556
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,570
I'm going to spend to come.

557
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,423
They're going to slip on it.

558
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,320
Thank you.

559
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,950
Also can estimate this again like.
