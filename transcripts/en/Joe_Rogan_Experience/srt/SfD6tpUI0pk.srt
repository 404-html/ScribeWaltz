00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:06,070
Hello Freak bitches.
Now as a person who's governed state and

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,460
you look at the,
what happens when someone gets an

3
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:10,150
office,
when,

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,430
when Obama gets an office,
promises all of these things,

5
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:14,260
gets an office,
changes almost everything.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,170
Um,
what are the hurdles?

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,970
I mean,
what are the differences between the

8
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:23,590
hurdles of someone who governs a state
versus someone who governs the United

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,080
States?
And how much more difficult is it to

10
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:29,990
change things?
It seems like the United States is like

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
a gigantic ship that takes so much
effort to shift even slightly that these

12
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:38,800
presidents get out of office eight years
later,

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,060
exhausted looking like they've aged 50
years and very little gets done.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,100
Well,
I,

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,720
I think there is a silver bullet to the
system and I hope I'm tying into what

16
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:51,910
you're saying,
but I do think there's a silver bullet

17
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:53,860
to the system and that would be term
limits.

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,440
Um,
I think that for the most part of

19
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:58,690
politicians,
once they get in office,

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,070
the main concern is to stay in off,
right?

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,190
And if you had term limits,
I think that people would do the right

22
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:11,191
thing as opposed to whatever it takes to
get to meet Bruce and for the Senate

23
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,300
Congress Senate anywhere,
right?

24
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,120
Well,
Supreme Court's,

25
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:17,320
uh,
another topic,

26
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,100
but,
uh,

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,020
but certainly elected office

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,100
agreed that we have it for the
president.

29
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,690
Why not have it for all elected offices?

30
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,380
I think I'm the best example of term
limits.

31
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,850
I really enjoyed the job.
I had the opportunity to serve for two

32
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:32,800
terms.
Uh,

33
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,270
so I,
in my estimation,

34
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:39,920
I press the limits term one,
but not to the point where I wasn't

35
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:43,790
going to get reelected.
And then when I get reelected I started

36
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,200
off by saying,
you know,

37
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:47,750
let's examine the drug war in this
country.

38
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:52,670
I started off by saying that marijuana
should be legalized taking on what I

39
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:56,690
thought at the time was,
and it still remains so as one of those

40
00:01:56,691 --> 00:02:00,560
really fixable things in our lives,
um,

41
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,900
that would make the world a better
place.

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,540
Um,
but because of term limits,

43
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,060
um,
I was emboldened because I,

44
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,160
man,
I was getting out of office and there

45
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:11,030
was no return.

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,530
Right.
Um,

47
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:15,590
what are your thoughts on all the other
recreational drugs,

48
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:18,280
not just marijuana,
but the more controversial ones like

49
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,100
maybe cocaine or Psilocybin,
lsd,

50
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,030
things along those lines.

51
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,080
So when I was governor of New Mexico,
I had a um,

52
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,220
uh,
I,

53
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,960
I went to Portland,
Oregon and judges in Portland,

54
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:33,030
Oregon.
There were judges that wanted to meet

55
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:37,740
with me in Portland and so I went to
meet with these judges and I didn't know

56
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,450
what the,
what it was going to be about,

57
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,090
but it was six judges,
Portland,

58
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:45,270
Oregon State district judges.
I'm sure I'm getting the wrong label,

59
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:46,950
but what they said was,
was,

60
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:48,180
hey,
governor Johnson,

61
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,740
we just,
we're here to tell you,

62
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:52,560
we completely agree with everything it
is that you're saying,

63
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:56,460
but we would like to share with you some
stories here that,

64
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:59,230
um,
maybe you can pass on to others that

65
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:02,230
will allow others to better understand
the drug issue.

66
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,220
They said that they're really horrible
drug out there as methamphetamine,

67
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,230
that people that use methamphetamine
really have their behavior altered and

68
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,190
not in a good way.

69
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,830
So it's really the bogeyman drug out
there.

70
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,560
They said I'm methamphetamine.
Is the best example that we can think of

71
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:24,910
of a prohibition drug?
It exists because it's cheap and it's

72
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:27,940
easy to make,
and what they said was was that,

73
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,890
hey,
we're not suggesting the following,

74
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,960
but if cocaine were legal,
these people would be using cocaine

75
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:39,550
instead of methamphetamine without the
negative behavioral consequence,

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,930
and that's true,
but if the government were to tell the

77
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:48,760
truth when it comes to cocaine,
cocaine puts holes in your heart.

78
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,980
People that use cocaine their entire
lives are stereotypically Whitney

79
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,130
Houston that die before they're 50
because they die of a heart attack from

80
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,540
using cocaine.
Now,

81
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:02,830
will there still be people that will use
cocaine knowing that they might die of a

82
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,320
heart attack?
I think.

83
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,030
I think there'd be less cocaine use if
people actually knew the truth and could

84
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:10,990
trust government.

85
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,100
When it comes to the truth,
I just maintain that 90 percent of the

86
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:19,300
drug problem is prohibition related,
not use related,

87
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,690
and that is not to discount the problems
with use and abuse,

88
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:27,010
but that should be the focus.
When you have 8,000 deaths a year in

89
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,570
this country,
8,000,

90
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:33,490
which is staggeringly low due to cocaine
and heroin overdose,

91
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,740
and people will immediately say,
well,

92
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,410
yeah,
the number is so low because it's

93
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,480
illegal.
No,

94
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,210
you can argue that if it were legal,
if quality quantity was known,

95
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,620
it's arguable that those desks would
significantly decrease.

96
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,920
Although there will always be people
that will commit suicide.

97
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,500
Always be people that will push the
limits.

98
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,300
Yes,

99
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,620
you're,
you're always gonna have people that

100
00:04:58,621 --> 00:04:59,970
abuse everything.
Everything,

101
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:00,781
everything,
everything.

102
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:01,501
I mean,
we're,

103
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,190
we're living in a culture that has
alcohol available at every block all

104
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:06,030
over the world.
I mean,

105
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:08,730
everywhere you go,
there's a restaurant or a bar or

106
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:11,670
somewhere that you can buy enough
alcohol to drink yourself to death.

107
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,420
It's readily available.
Yet when you consider the amount of

108
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:17,520
people that actually drink alcohol,
the,

109
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:17,941
the,
uh,

110
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:20,760
the low number of deaths is pretty
incredible.

111
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,720
And it's because we're aware of the
effects of alcohol and it's pretty.

112
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,900
When you get a bottle of Jack Daniels is
pretty consistent.

113
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,990
Well,
but there are 100,000 deaths a year that

114
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,090
are contributed,
uh,

115
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,790
that,
uh,

116
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,000
get contributed to alcohol consumption
and I'm not talking about drinking and

117
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:40,750
driving or,
or violence committed under the equal

118
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,440
abuse,
alcohol abuse,

119
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,340
statistically,
no one dies from marijuana.

120
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,180
That

121
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,150
what I was going to get to was that when
you look at what's happening in

122
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:52,580
Colorado,
one of the more interesting things is

123
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,060
the lessening of violent crime and drunk
driving.

124
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,080
Those are two effects that have dropped
pretty drastically,

125
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:04,820
noticeably statistically because of the
legalization of marijuana that you would

126
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:08,090
reduce because of the legalization of a
less harmful,

127
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,110
more peaceful drug.
You'd reduce the effects of what's right

128
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,630
now,
a readily available and incredibly

129
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:15,500
prevalent drug.

130
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,230
I have always maintained that legalizing
marijuana will make for a better planet

131
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,190
on the medicinal side of marijuana.
Um,

132
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,570
marijuana products directly compete with
legal prescription drugs,

133
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:33,960
pain killers,
antidepressants that statistically kill

134
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,660
100,000 people a year.
No,

135
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,910
no documented death due to marijuana.
On the recreational side,

136
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:46,590
I've always maintained that legalizing
marijuana will lead to less overall

137
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:51,240
substance abuse because people are going
to find it as such a safer alternative

138
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:54,240
than everything else that's out there.
Starting with alcohol.

139
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,630
The campaign to legalize marijuana in
Colorado was a campaign based on

140
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:03,360
marijuana is safer than alcohol.
And Joe,

141
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:07,800
as you were pointing out all the
statistics that all the naysayers were

142
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:09,490
going to go south,
uh,

143
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,100
have gone,
have gone better.

144
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,590
There are less traffic instance.
There's less overall crime in the state

145
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:20,640
of Colorado.
Colorado is vibrant and does it have to

146
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,310
do with marijuana?
I think that that's an ingredient,

147
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,850
uh,
comprised in why Colorado is so vibrant

148
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:27,684
right now

149
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,000
questionably unquestionable.
And I think a prime example of how

150
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:37,001
screwy the system gets when people lobby
against the legalization of things that

151
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:42,761
don't harm anyone is the fact that hemp
is illegal federally and that we're

152
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,820
trying to make it legal and trying to
make it legal statewide and in various

153
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:50,510
states and start production of hemp.
But hemp is not psychoactive.

154
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,710
It's crazy.

155
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,733
We,
we,

156
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,080
we can sell hemp products in this
country,

157
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,840
but they,
they come from China.

158
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,890
My bias or my company on it,
we buy it from Canada.

159
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,090
We buy hemp protein from Canada and it
can't grow it in America.

160
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:07,770
We can import it,
but we can't grow it.

161
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:09,330
CBD,
CBD oil.

162
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,350
Yes.
Same thing.

163
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,220
Not psychoactive helps pain.
Very effective for people just not

164
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:16,620
getting people hired.
It's not ruining lives,

165
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,140
not doing anything,
but there's a lot of people that are

166
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:22,050
concerned that are making money off of
the alternatives.

167
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,020
Especially with hemp.
I mean that was the reason why marijuana

168
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:26,250
was made illegal in the first place.

169
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,190
That's the reason it was about hemp,
the conspiracy of dupont to promote

170
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:33,850
nylon as opposed to,
uh,

171
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,520
and,
and of course they,

172
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,760
Randolph hearst with his paper
factories,

173
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,990
they made a,
they made a marijuana illegal.

174
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:46,991
But because the marijuana plant in the
hemp plant look the same then hence hemp

175
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:50,260
was also made illegal.
Yeah,

176
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,103
that was,

177
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,380
yeah,
conspiracy.

178
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,220
Yeah.
Well that's,

179
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,010
I mean that's all been proven.
So it's,

180
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,160
we're in a strange time that it's 2016.
It's still illegal.

181
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,730
Again,
slowly starting to become legal and

182
00:09:01,731 --> 00:09:04,230
people starting to,
I believe in Kentucky and a few other

183
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:06,960
states,
they're allowing farmers to profit off

184
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:10,560
of this incredibly vibrant plant.
It's easy to grow,

185
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:14,850
doesn't require pesticides,
has a variety of uses as a textile,

186
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:19,260
as a commodity for food,
full amino acid profile.

187
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:21,720
It makes amazing clothes and made this
jacket.

188
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,110
This is made out of hemp.
I mean,

189
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,100
if it's.
If,

190
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,430
if the marijuana plant were discovered
today in the Amazon,

191
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:33,431
it would be hailed as the greatest
discovery of humankind in 1999.

192
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,790
A good news,
bad news here in 1999,

193
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,910
I was the highest elected official in
the United States to call for the

194
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:44,810
legalization of marijuana in 2016.
Bad News.

195
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,440
I'm still the highest elected official
in the United States to call for the

196
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:51,650
legalization of marijuana.
Although Bernie Sanders apparently

197
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:56,090
rolled out of bed and hit his head and
now he's come to that same epiphany.

198
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:57,350
Wonderful.
I'm glad,

199
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,500
but in 1990 minutes a roll out of bed
and hit his head on that.

200
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,460
He came to this epiphany at this point
in his life.

201
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,000
He's never said it before,
uh,

202
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,260
no,
not until he's been running for a,

203
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,630
for Senate.
So you think it's like one of those lick

204
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:13,850
your finger and put it up in the air and
check where the breeze is going.

205
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm glad that he's joined the big crowd,
but,

206
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,290
but in 1999,
30 percent of Americans supported

207
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:26,291
legalizing marijuana in 2016,
60 percent of Americans now are

208
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:31,421
supporting the legalization of marijuana
and not one politician outside of Bernie

209
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,270
Sanders in office,
um,

210
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,670
is.
And when I say elected official at the

211
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:41,030
congressional,
senatorial or gubernatorial level,

212
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,900
not one politician in that group outside
of Bernie Sanders,

213
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,690
myself,
have a spouse legalizing marijuana.

214
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,890
I think what a disconnect.
What an incredible disconnect between

215
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:54,200
what people think and our elected
officials.
