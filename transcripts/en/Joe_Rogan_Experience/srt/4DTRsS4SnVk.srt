00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,230
Hello Freak bitches 200 years ago.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,940
The day where they're all like,

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:07,290
what the fuck are we doing?

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,630
I'm not wearing the wig,

5
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:10,350
bro.

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,640
I'm not wearing the fucking wig.

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,680
Like leg day.

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,920
I should bring it back.

9
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,401
Fuck it.

10
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:15,360
My hair fell out.

11
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:15,931
I'm gone.

12
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:16,291
Pattern.

13
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,060
We'll with you at the comedy store.

14
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:18,690
You,

15
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,260
you and me,

16
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,951
fanny pack,

17
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:20,820
400 wigs.

18
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,311
Fuck yeah.

19
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:22,170
Fanny packs right here.

20
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:22,830
Dude.

21
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,663
Right there on that.

22
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,530
That's right.

23
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:24,880
I,

24
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,710
I wear mine all the time and my son gave
me shit about it and then guess what?

25
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,060
Six months later he's like,

26
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,601
Dad,

27
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:31,770
he's still got that fanny pack.

28
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:31,920
Oh,

29
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,401
he wants what?

30
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:33,750
He's wearing those I'll get 'em one.

31
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,741
Yeah,

32
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:36,380
I've got some my higher primate ones,

33
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:36,640
right?

34
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,351
The right ones.

35
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:37,991
I'll give you one of those,

36
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:38,310
didn't I?

37
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,491
Yeah.

38
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:39,390
I wear it all the time.

39
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:40,190
That's what I'm saying.

40
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,820
All all praise be the dice clay.

41
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,200
He started it.

42
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,250
Yeah.

43
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,570
Well I always wore fanny packs.

44
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,740
I've been wearing fanny packs forever,

45
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:48,930
but they were crappy and
then dice clay came in.

46
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:49,201
I went,

47
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:52,110
what is this exceptional piece of
hardware you have around your waist?

48
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:52,621
It was like,

49
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:52,891
oh,

50
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:53,724
you'll like this.

51
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,010
Oh yes,

52
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:56,920
it's from roots.

53
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,813
Roots.

54
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,480
Fanny pack is fucking beautiful.

55
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:01,710
The way it clips together,

56
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:03,330
it's like it's perfect size.

57
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:04,770
Organize Shit in my pockets.

58
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:07,020
Tries [inaudible] new phone is,

59
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,390
I take everything out of my
pockets wherever I go and
I lose shit shorts at all.

60
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,590
There's nothing in my pockets.

61
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,040
My little man bags.

62
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,893
That's it.

63
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,460
I wore a fanny pack this morning.

64
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,530
I got a sports one cause I ran.

65
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:19,741
Ooh.

66
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:20,550
Those are good.

67
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,990
And I put it around my waist.

68
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,090
The little sports ones.

69
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,163
Oh yeah.

70
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:26,641
Oh by the way,

71
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,320
shit my pants while running this morning.

72
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,370
Did you?

73
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,060
Not Hard.

74
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,893
Just a,

75
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,853
it was a shark.

76
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,970
I was coming up a hill.

77
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,060
I was,

78
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,770
I was in mile for it.

79
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,350
Had nothing left and I,

80
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:41,550
and I thought I had to fart and
just Bam shard and my underwear.

81
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,900
I did that the other day in my house.

82
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,823
Yeah,

83
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,081
just a little squirt.

84
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:47,790
And Jesus Christ feels
like such a failure,

85
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,890
but it had some good farts before that.

86
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:50,790
That's a problem.

87
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,091
Yeah.

88
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,850
I got motivated because I had,

89
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:57,851
so you were on a roll rumblers
watch Jesus and it was just me.

90
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,540
I wish I didn't have to
cover from no worries.

91
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,550
I was pausing and leaning into
them and then it just a little,

92
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,620
ah,

93
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,090
fuck ah,

94
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,230
catch the shower.

95
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,190
That's a shower.

96
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,470
But it was interesting because
as soon as I got on the bowl,

97
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,230
all of a sudden I had explosive diarrhea.

98
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:16,741
I'm like,

99
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:17,670
where was this?

100
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,430
Like I'd had no idea that's up.

101
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,690
Diarrhea was looming.

102
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,440
Meanwhile,

103
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,220
holiday eating,

104
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,140
that's holiday eating probably.

105
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,740
Yeah.

106
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,010
Well,

107
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,810
creams and Shit Wad also,

108
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:32,200
I go off the Diet and I started eating
like Pumpkin Pie and ice cream and shit

109
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:33,034
and all the cream.

110
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,580
Yeah,

111
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,460
with a lot of bread.

112
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:37,350
I had a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich last night,

113
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,870
but as the ultimate failure,

114
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:43,950
because your job as a human is to
provide for your family and not shit your

115
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:44,784
pants.

116
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,770
You think about it all the time.

117
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:48,060
Every time you fart,

118
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:48,560
you,

119
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:48,781
you,

120
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:51,090
there's a little moment
where you weigh in on it,

121
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,560
you feel it out,

122
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,070
feel your intestines,

123
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,871
you feel your anus,

124
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:57,360
you make a judgment
call and you let it rip.

125
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,111
What's interesting,

126
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:02,650
if you think about how in you are to
the sensations you get from your inner

127
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:03,340
colon,

128
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,870
because there's times you know like,

129
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,291
oh no,

130
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,580
I'm about to shit my pants.

131
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,540
There's like a,

132
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,780
there's a certain alarm that
goes off like when you're like,

133
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,531
oh no,

134
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:11,711
no,

135
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,970
we're coaching a little too hard here.

136
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,271
Okay,

137
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,380
we've got a problem here boys.

138
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,214
We got a runner,

139
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,053
we got a runner,

140
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,460
we got her runner.

141
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,830
Barely it in Kiki.

142
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,340
Close the Yay

143
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,980
clamping down.

144
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,730
And it's the same exact

145
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,000
feeling that you get is when
you're trying to hold common.

146
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,130
You know that Domo Shit.

147
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:34,720
Yeah,

148
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,290
like Superbad clamping
everything in like that.

149
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:38,431
I've,

150
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:40,900
I'll always say one day
I'm gonna try Tantra.

151
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,140
I'm going to learn how to like completely
like guys say that you can have like

152
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,990
an internal orgasm for your,

153
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:48,100
your contractions so long that you come,

154
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:48,371
but no,

155
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:48,611
come,

156
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:50,440
comes out and your body reabsorbs it.

157
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,450
And it makes you look Super Sayan power.

158
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,313
Yeah,

159
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,670
I've choke one back.

160
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,910
Wow.

161
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,020
Just got to grab the base right
before impact and squeeze really hard.

162
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,330
It's got to be long
enough where it begins,

163
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,680
but not so long that it comes out.

164
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:03,940
And I've pushed it back in again.

165
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,010
But what if you cause an injury?

166
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,521
Yeah,

167
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:07,260
that's the problem.

168
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,280
What if you get crazy and
you just really grab it?

169
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,400
It's why I've only done
it a couple of times.

170
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,500
And you broke your own deck
because you grabbed it too hard.

171
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,750
God Damn,

172
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,130
life would not be worth living.

173
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:18,970
Can you imagine that?

174
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:22,690
Not Having your Dick come anymore for
the rest of your life and knowing that

175
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,650
what percentage of your life revolves
around getting rid of come once a day.

176
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,171
Okay,

177
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:29,980
but once a day.

178
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,240
So if it's once a day,

179
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:33,280
if it's even 45 minutes of your time,

180
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,550
the other 23 hours and
15 minutes are bullshit.

181
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,931
You thinking like,

182
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:39,460
this is what I can't lose.

183
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,690
I can't lose the

184
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,060
balancing myself to a lot of guys,

185
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:50,170
like if you had to choose between being
blind or having your Dick break where

186
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:50,270
you,

187
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,670
dick can never get it up again.

188
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,210
Oh,

189
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,320
no question.

190
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,310
What would you say?

191
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,900
Give me the fucking stick and the dog.

192
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,973
Give

193
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,760
me the Stevie wonder glasses.

194
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,410
Very superstitious

195
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,890
and he's getting laid after the show.

196
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,450
[inaudible].
