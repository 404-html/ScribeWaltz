1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,800
So I might plug some dates or like do
it,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,933
do it.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,220
And we're live.
Judd,

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,840
how are you buddy?
Yeah,

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,420
Judd apatow here,
dude.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,850
You know susman real well.
Not only do I know your manager,

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,590
sussman judge Sussman when I was a kid,
I loved comedy.

8
00:00:21,591 --> 00:00:25,430
So I got a job at the east side comedy
club that would just in Huntington on

9
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:30,431
long island.
This is about 83 84 he was the bartender

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,290
and he used to give me rides home
because I lived really far away and I

11
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:41,291
used to take a cab home and spend all
the money I made as a dishwasher on the

12
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:43,310
cab ride home.
Wow.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,170
But I just wanted to be in the club near
comics.

14
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:47,180
Eddie Murphy was coming in.
It was crazy.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,930
Uh,
and I swear to God,

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,530
this is no bs.
You have those people in your life that

17
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:58,250
you remember who were insanely kind and
cool.

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,070
And Jeff Sussman was like that.

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,450
As a,
as a young kid,

20
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:04,340
I was maybe 15 or 16.
I thought,

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,200
this is the greatest guy I've ever met.
He's so nice to me.

22
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:10,790
It gives me a ride home.
He's funny and I'm so glad,

23
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,320
uh,
that he's rich now.

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,100
He's been my manager since I was an open
miker.

25
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,720
Yeah,
he discovered him.

26
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:21,320
He is an open miker or in Boston.
Who are his first clients?

27
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,910
Uh,
Bob Nelson.

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,160
Yeah.
Bob Nelson at the east side comedy club.

29
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,080
Nothing funnier.
He used to do a show once a week and one

30
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:33,230
of the things he did is he would just
turn on the radio and scan through the

31
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:36,590
channels and do improv based on what was
on the radio.

32
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,770
So if it was elevated music,
he would do a dentist routine.

33
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:42,140
If it was heavy metal,
he would suddenly do like a heavy metal

34
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:45,080
guy.
And it was incredible.

35
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,980
Yeah,
that guy was huge at one point in time.

36
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,260
And then I think he blew a fuse or
something.

37
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,460
I think he's a very religious person now
and he's still performs in Branson.

38
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,590
It's a nice way of saying he blew a
fuse.

39
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,170
Depends on your view of things.
I guess maybe he's happier than all of

40
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:05,840
us.
That would be highly unlikely,

41
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,060
but maybe,
but God,

42
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,440
was he funny.
I mean truly.

43
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:12,260
It's funny as people get,
and then he built a thing on stage.

44
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,340
You have to imagine this.
He built like a wall on the stage and in

45
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:20,120
the wall he built two doors and he would
do all these bits.

46
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:23,720
We would come in and out of doors as
different people and then he did a thing

47
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:28,100
where he would like come out of the door
like one out of one door across the

48
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:32,300
stage and in the other door and then run
out that door again as a different

49
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:32,810
person.

50
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,810
So it looked like he was chasing himself
like it'd be like a gorilla chasing Bob,

51
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,330
but he would just change his body
language as he ran in and out of these

52
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:43,190
doors.
It was really creative.

53
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:46,050
No one has ever really done stuff like
that since even,

54
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,320
well,
something happened somewhere along the

55
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:52,850
line where carrot top owns props.
They don't,

56
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:55,580
no one does props anymore.
You remember when we first starting out

57
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,740
there was prop comics.
It was your genre.

58
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,400
There was Dennis Miller to do.
Perhaps when he started,

59
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:04,690
I heard that he used to put his lips
through a 45 record and I forgot what

60
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:07,810
the bid was and die.
I threw a couple of props.

61
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:11,710
First few times I went on stage.
I remember bringing a light and putting

62
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:14,890
it to my finger to make my finger look
like ets finger.

63
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,760
I can't quite remember what the bid was,
but that's how little material I had.

64
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,400
Isn't it funny though that that genre is
just sort of dissolved and it is funny

65
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,650
as hell I would to see carrot top in
Vegas.

66
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,110
I mean it's a ridiculous show.
I laughed my ass off.

67
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,420
I brought my whole family.
We really laughed hard.

68
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,950
I mean that is a funny genre of just
ridiculous,

69
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:41,680
stupid prop jokes,
carrot top case,

70
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,440
way more shit than he deserves.
He's very funny.

71
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,970
Oh no,
he's very silly.

72
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:47,590
Funny.
I mean I've always,

73
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:50,110
for the silly guys,
you know I love,

74
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,110
you know all the smart people in the
inventive people,

75
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,320
but this silly guy is also pretty great
and it's hard to write super silly jokes

76
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:02,890
and make people laugh out loud.
Like there's Comedians who are funny and

77
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:03,311
you're like,
oh,

78
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,930
that's funny.
And then there are people who actually

79
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:09,520
make you piss your pants.
And the one thing that job did,

80
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:12,330
it made me laugh was he was reds around
the crowded subway.

81
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,180
He's like giving the crowd shots,
he's handy out cups.

82
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,290
I'd really fast pouring shots and
they're spilling on people if he's ready

83
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,020
around giving people shots.
And then he like turned to somebody,

84
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,511
he's like,
okay,

85
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:23,620
give it to you,
you're pregnant.

86
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,420
But she clearly wasn't pregnant.
It was just a Chubby lady and it got

87
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:30,070
really awkward.
No,

88
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,680
that's always the best.
When you make that mistake,

89
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,570
are you allowed to just give people
shots?

90
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:37,350
Like what if you have an alcoholic but
they're just there.

91
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,590
They're sober,
but you are like so influential.

92
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:44,140
They go off fucking one drinks,
not going to hurt and then boom,

93
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:47,560
you just throw their life off track and
carrot top wanted it to happen.

94
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,500
Yeah.
You gotta be careful with that now.

95
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,300
Uh,
I certainly am not pouring booze for the

96
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,580
crowd,
but I appreciated it as someone

97
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,620
observing carrot top.

98
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,860
I appreciate that too.
But I would think as a performer you'd

99
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:03,250
have to be really concerned.
Too many people that you give them one

100
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:07,180
shot and they uh,
they vander Doug stamper from house of

101
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,520
cards.
Maybe carrot top is getting pre show

102
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,770
releases.
There can be a whole system

103
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,370
of how he knows who to give the shots
to.

104
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,850
He survives in Vegas too.
That does.

105
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,680
There's not a whole lot of people that
do that anymore.

106
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,650
Yeah,
there's like Penn and teller and they'd

107
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:24,940
been there forever.
Right.

108
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:26,860
But their show is a magic show.
Right.

109
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:30,820
And then there used to be like a lot of
residents they were doing stand up,

110
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,320
George Wallace,
Rita Rudner,

111
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,240
George George Wallace quit doing that,
right?

112
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,370
Yeah.
He did it for a long time and he had

113
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,090
enough at something,
something.

114
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,790
He explained to me how hard it is like
you have to,

115
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,670
you have to fill that room like every
night.

116
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,980
Villain rooms.
Let me say,

117
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:48,340
I said I'm going to who makes movies and
is terrified that people will show up.

118
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,610
Filling rooms scares me as well.
Like we have a movie,

119
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:54,370
the big sick,
it opens in New York and La this weekend

120
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,620
and then in two weeks it opens around
the country.

121
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,130
It's a kumail,
Nanjiani,

122
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,640
Holly Hunter and Ray Romano based on an
experience that happened to Kumail

123
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,920
Nanjiani when he met his wife and he
was,

124
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,420
he's from Pakistan and his parents
wanted him to have an arranged marriage,

125
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:12,290
but he fell in love with an American
woman and then she quickly got sick and

126
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,310
had to be put into a coma and it's this
really hilarious,

127
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,100
fascinating,
true story about him hanging out with

128
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:22,640
her parents while she's in a coma.
It's just a very unique story,

129
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:25,550
but it works great.
It's like 98% on rotten tomatoes.

130
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,180
It's like one of those gem movies that
comes around every like four or five

131
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,050
years.
What's it called?

132
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,340
It's called the big sick.
And so like right now I'm terrified,

133
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,510
you know,
will people go,

134
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:40,190
will you get off your ass for a great,
hilarious movie to go to a theater?

135
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,280
And it's the same thing with a stand up,
you know,

136
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:47,570
now that I'm doing some concerts,
I do you like track like how they're

137
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:48,050
selling.

138
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,940
It's a scary thing.
They go,

139
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,240
yeah,
don't worry about this city.

140
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:53,630
Uh,
they always sell late and then you look

141
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:55,880
at your numbers for months and no one
bought tickets.

142
00:06:55,881 --> 00:07:00,290
And then like in the last two weeks they
sell out or do you just not tuned in at

143
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,900
all?
I try to tune into as little as I

144
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:04,240
possibly can.
Yeah.

145
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,830
Other than like doing the jokes
themselves,

146
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:09,320
doing the shows themselves,
you know,

147
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,600
family,
hobbies,

148
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,550
yes.
I don't tune in anymore.

149
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,820
I just feel like there's no reason to
have fuck you money if you don't say

150
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:19,790
fuck you.
So I'm supposed to be saying fuck you

151
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,570
right now.
Yeah.

152
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,490
But not really saying fuck you.
Just,

153
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:25,070
there's things to think about and
there's things to not think about.

154
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,420
Like there's like the things that like,
you don't have really any control over,

155
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,020
like whether or not people buy tickets
if fucking hilarious.

156
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,450
Yeah.
What are you worried about man?

157
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,090
You're super successful.
You've done some of the greatest movies

158
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,610
of all time,
but the things that always drive me is

159
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:43,340
the terror of things not working out.
You know?

160
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:46,430
That's what keeps me on my game is,
is to be scared.

161
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,890
That's why I'm going to tell your crowd
right now.

162
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,750
That's good because that's one of the
reasons why you're still good,

163
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:51,890
but just let me help you out,
dude.

164
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:52,700
You've,
you've,

165
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,130
you have to care.
Greatest comedy movies ever.

166
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,900
Just chill out.
No,

167
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:57,830
I can't chill out,
Joe.

168
00:07:57,831 --> 00:07:59,750
I can't chill out.
That's why I'm going to tell people I'd

169
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:04,010
be at the Columbus Theater and
Providence Road at July 25th,

170
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,780
uh,
early with the plot and then a play

171
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,240
playhouse on July 23rd in Ridgefield,
Connecticut.

172
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,100
Then I met the,
the Wilbur in Boston.

173
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,720
That's one of the great,
the best place,

174
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,770
right?
Great Place.

175
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,970
Do you have a website where people could
read all these cause they're not going

176
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:19,400
to remember.
They're probably in their car right now.

177
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:22,970
They're like fucking the Wilburn boss
and July 24 of the wilbur.com.

178
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:23,840
I don't know.
See this is how I,

179
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:26,000
your website.
No website.

180
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:27,740
I've got nothing.
You don't have a website?

181
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,670
I don't I suppose to,
I thought websites.

182
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,020
My kids make fun of me.
If I even talk about the web.

183
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,460
Like if I say like kids.
Yeah,

184
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:36,920
let's find out on the of the worldwide
web.

185
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:39,200
They like dad.
No one calls it the worldwide web

186
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:40,880
anymore.
My daughter yelled at me the other day.

187
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:41,631
She said,
dad,

188
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:45,200
no one emails don't email me,
text me.

189
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,340
And she acted like I was like talking
about ham radio.

190
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,690
Yeah.
You might want to tell your kid to shut

191
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:51,730
the fuck up.
Exactly.

192
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,000
Like emails.
Everybody.

193
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,040
I email every,
what are you talking about?

194
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,100
I guess the kids don't,
the kids don't have attachments.

195
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,560
I think that they don't need it cause
there's no attachments.

196
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,470
Like it never has a pdf to send.
That's true.

197
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,960
And they don't spell your,
they don't care.

198
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,830
Every kid spells you are every fucking
thing there.

199
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,960
And what,
how old are your kids?

200
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,740
I have a 20 I have a nine and a seven
girls.

201
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,970
All,
yeah,

202
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:20,280
I'm old girls.
I'm 19 and 14 old girls.

203
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:23,520
Chaos,
chaos and they'll gang up on me and the

204
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,070
teen years are rough.
They were rough.

205
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:28,560
They turn on you a little bit.
The genetically,

206
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,920
I think they're supposed to like push
for their freedom and turn on you for a

207
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,230
while.
I also think they're so confused.

208
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:38,010
There's so many hormones raging to their
system that didn't exist just to like

209
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,660
there were a new person.
Like if you,

210
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:44,070
if you stop to think about how you are
when you're 11 and then how you are when

211
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:47,310
you're 15 it's only four years later and
you're a totally different human.

212
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,020
Yes.
I tell them that.

213
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,100
I say you're acting hormonal right now.
Can you please stop?

214
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,140
They can't help.
But we talk about the chemicals.

215
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,140
I have this book,
it's called a yes,

216
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:00,450
your teen is crazy.
And then whenever they give me a hard

217
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:02,190
time,
I just take it out and just reading it

218
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:03,024
in front of them.

219
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,120
But it is all about how their brain
isn't even cooked yet.

220
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,360
Right.
Your brain doesn't really cook til your

221
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:13,170
early twenties and you're impulse
control and everything is gone.

222
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,890
And that what you're supposed to do as a
parent is model,

223
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:18,930
same behavior.
And if they,

224
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,490
if they see you not lose your shit
thousands of times maybe that we'll

225
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:28,080
program them to handle problems as well,
but they are going to freak out a ton

226
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:31,560
and you shouldn't get that mad out of
them at them because they're not capable

227
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:34,320
of not freaking out.
But that is a hard advice.

228
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,960
It's hard advice.
And when you get down to the youngest

229
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:37,640
one,
like my,

230
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,800
my youngest is seven and I'm like,
don't you have your shit together yet?

231
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,660
Come on.
Everybody else is older than you.

232
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:43,710
Let's go,
let's go.

233
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,270
So they don't get a full shot.
But the younger kid always thinks

234
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:49,920
they're allowed to do with the older
kids.

235
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,980
Do.
So it gets scarier as,

236
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,630
as you have more kids,
right,

237
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,060
because they go,
well my older sister does that so aren't

238
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:58,440
and I allowed to do that now.
And you're like,

239
00:10:58,441 --> 00:10:59,580
no,
you're seven.

240
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,290
Uh,
yeah.

241
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,790
It's,
it's a really weird time.

242
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,040
I think especially in California,
you know,

243
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,290
marijuana is basically legal.
It's a d it's a difficult debate to have

244
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,660
with kids.
What it is legal.

245
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,060
You can't even pull out the,
it's illegal card.

246
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,470
Right.
I'm not worried about marijuana.

247
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,890
And what age though would you not worry
about marijuana?

248
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,860
I'm not worried about it at any age.
If your seven year olds like,

249
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:24,320
you know what?
Someone handed me an edible.

250
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,080
Absolutely don't want my seven year old
or my nine year old to be smoking pot.

251
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:30,600
But I'm not worried about pot morgan
about alcohol.

252
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,430
Yes,
I'm worried about alcohol and I'm

253
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,540
worried about driving.

254
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,330
I'm worried about like teens drinking
and driving.

255
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,920
That's that.
That freaks me out.

256
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:42,720
Like her being with her friends as they
go to high school and that,

257
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:47,310
that freaks me out because kids just
don't know what their tolerances are.

258
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:51,840
They don't understand the effects of
alcohol on the body and your ability to

259
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,070
react.
That's curious.

260
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,070
It's all about uber or lyft.
I think that is one thing I noticed that

261
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:00,610
all the kids are,
there seems to be a lot less drunk

262
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:03,490
driving cause they all just uber.
Oh it's amazing if you can afford it,

263
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:05,440
but if you can't afford it,
I guess you're still screwed.

264
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,390
Yeah,
you are screwed if you can't afford it.

265
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:10,690
But it's pretty reasonable if you're
just moving around the general area.

266
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:13,630
Like if you're hopping around West
Hollywood and going from the store to

267
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,520
the Improv,
people do it all the time.

268
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,650
It's a couple of bucks.
It's not that big a deal and it's like

269
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:21,190
it's saves you all the worry and hassle
of being a drunk.

270
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,810
Are you a neurotic dad or a calm dad?
I tried to be as calm as I can.

271
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,620
You know,
certain amount of neurotic that's seeks

272
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:32,440
in seeps in every now and then,
but I try to be really calm.

273
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

274
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,330
The,
you know,

275
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:39,330
the thing is just everybody does it.
Everybody grows up and just haven't have

276
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:41,140
it.
Be Fun as much as possible.

277
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,070
I have a friend,
uh,

278
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,230
it older gentleman who's had a bunch of
kids.

279
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,730
He's always,
he's always said to me,

280
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,680
you know,
you got to let him go through it.

281
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:48,670
You know,
they're going to good.

282
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,860
They're going to do the drugs.
It's fine.

283
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:52,660
They get through it.
They figure it out.

284
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:53,440
You know,
you got,

285
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,570
they're going to have sex.

286
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,980
You can't stop it.
You get to let them go through it.

287
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:59,350
They'll,
they'll figure it is your friend.

288
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,570
The dude from the big Lebowski is,
it's a,

289
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,870
it's literally a John Goodman.
I sat down with the dude was,

290
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:05,800
uh,
what's his face?

291
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,940
Not John Goodman,
the other guy.

292
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,460
What's his name?
Jeff.

293
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,950
Uh,
Jeff.

294
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:11,351
Fuck.
Oh,

295
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:12,460
Jeff Bridges.
Jeff Bridges.

296
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:13,294
Yeah.
He's a dude.

297
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,310
Yo,
he's the dude in the movie,

298
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:16,144
right?
Yeah.

299
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,220
I saw it the other day.
I haven't seen it in years.

300
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,540
I was fucking crying,
laughing.

301
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,521
Oh,
it's a good way.

302
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:22,690
It used to be my movie,
my litmus test for whether or not I

303
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:23,950
could talk to you.
Like,

304
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,860
how do you feel about the Bagel basket
booster?

305
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,980
Shit,
I got to go.

306
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,930
Yes,
we did an episode of freaks and geeks

307
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:33,250
where he shows John Daly's character
saying we're shows a girl of the jerk

308
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,460
and she hates it and,
and he breaks up with a cheerleader at

309
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:38,800
school cause she hates the jerk.

310
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,620
Good for him.
I said with a girl in high school where

311
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:45,640
she hated n e t and I and that was a
rough one to where it rough on to

312
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,830
survive back then.
Yeah.

313
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:51,640
There's certain music and there's
certain movies that you're just not

314
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:53,380
allowed to like or hate.
Yes.

315
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,860
Yeah.
Well that's a funny thing.

316
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,710
My wife and I is,
we violently disagree on a lot of that

317
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,840
stuff.
We don't have like one or two violently.

318
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,491
Yeah,
there's,

319
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:06,850
there's one or two like the main things
that mean the most to me in the world

320
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:08,950
where my wife's like I can't,
I can't,

321
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:11,560
I don't like it at all.
And then stuff that she likes it,

322
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:14,020
I go,
I hate that more than anything.

323
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,360
I think that's good.
I think it's good,

324
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,370
especially with your spouse to have like
very few interests in common.

325
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,280
I think all those people that do
everything together,

326
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,680
a fucking Weirdos man,
they always freak me out.

327
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,450
That it,
that is interesting.

328
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,284
Yeah.
Cause it's a,

329
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,020
it's like stand up.
My wife,

330
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,690
I met her when I wasn't doing stand up.
I did stand up from the time I was 17

331
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:39,910
until I was 24.
I met my wife when I was 28 or 29 so she

332
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:43,360
didn't know anything about staying up
until three years ago when I started

333
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:44,440
doing it again.
Yeah.

334
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:46,360
What,
what caused you to do that?

335
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,210
I remember when you started coming
around,

336
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,670
everybody was like look at Judd and was
doing,

337
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,543
it's funny,
I,

338
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,660
I uh,
I,

339
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,570
when I stopped when I was 24,
I was pretty burnt out.

340
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,910
So that was 92 and I was getting a lot
of writing work.

341
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:04,910
The Ben Stiller show got picked up,
this sketch show we did for Fox and that

342
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:06,970
kept me busy and I was making,
you know,

343
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,000
a lot of money compared to the $500 a
week I was making,

344
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,650
doing standup on the road.

345
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,110
And I thought,
well,

346
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:19,040
this is the universe saying you don't
need to do stand up and you should stop.

347
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,990
Maybe your friends are funnier than you.
And I'm living with Sandler and I'm

348
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:26,730
hanging out with opening up for Jim
Carrey and it's,

349
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,510
it's daunting.
You know,

350
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,520
it's like trying to start a band and
your friend is John Lennon.

351
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,350
He just feel like
it would be weird to not feel like a

352
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:39,320
dick.
I was cocky with Jim Carrey and oh yeah,

353
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,300
the funnier than this guy.
I mean,

354
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,010
I'm a sane human being.
I know,

355
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,590
I know what's happening.
Um,

356
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,010
and I was also a little bored of it
because I was so obsessed since I,

357
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,430
since I was 10 and you know,
I did funny people,

358
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:55,040
I did a little standup to write jokes
for funny people.

359
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,740
So I was writing jokes but it was for
Adam's character.

360
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,760
And then I started hanging out with Amy
Schumer working on train wreck and she

361
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:05,480
would come back from these tours and I
just got jealous.

362
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,970
I thought,
that sounds like the most fun thing.

363
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,080
And then one night I said to her,
I'm going to go up tonight just to make

364
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:15,380
you laugh just to,
so you could see what it was like when I

365
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:17,780
did stand up.
And then I told a couple of stories.

366
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:20,060
I had told her on talk shows and I knew
would go okay.

367
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,330
And Amy was very excited hoping I was
going to bomb.

368
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,340
Like she was thought this would be this
funny thing.

369
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,240
Judd bombs at the comedy cellar and I
did pretty good just cause it's stories.

370
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:32,420
I know work okay.
And then the common,

371
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:33,021
he's probably said,
hey,

372
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:35,600
anytime you want to come back,
just pop in,

373
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,010
we'll put you up.
Now.

374
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:40,820
No one ever said that when I was a comic
because it was hard to get stage time.

375
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,470
And I thought,
wait a second,

376
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:47,471
I'm getting treated like somebody who,
who gets the show up and go on stage.

377
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,050
I have to take advantage of this.
And I went on every night,

378
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,380
the entire shoot of train wreck.
No matter what time we finished

379
00:16:53,381 --> 00:16:55,040
shooting,
I would drive straight to the comedy

380
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,360
cellar.
Wow.

381
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,300
And I had the best time.
And then I came back to la and started

382
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:01,610
doing the Improv and the comedy store in
Largo and,

383
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,210
and then I would put these benefits
together at Largo once a month.

384
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:07,850
And,
and to me that was the most fun because

385
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:12,851
I could book a show and get like
channeling to come and Randy Newman or

386
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,490
you know,
Aziz and Fiona apple and we did them all

387
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:20,000
his benefits and I always liked
producing things like that.

388
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,900
And then slowly my act got to the point
where I thought,

389
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,763
oh,
I'm,

390
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,720
you know,
I deserve to be here.

391
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:28,460
This isn't some freak show.
Well,

392
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:31,790
you know the difference between someone
who writes for television and movies

393
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,920
and,
and the different stream that,

394
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:38,921
and a lot of stand ups is when you're
making a living writing and producing

395
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:42,470
and directing and doing all,
you're disciplined you right?

396
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,580
Yes,
actually right.

397
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,530
You have notes,
you have books you have like you're

398
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,140
opening up your binder,
you're going over your stuff.

399
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,100
So comics don't do that.

400
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,000
I remember when I started,
I was opening for Larry Miller,

401
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:58,500
one of the legendary comedians and he,
he would have these incredible,

402
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:00,330
but some of them were like 10 minutes
long.

403
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,040
He had a great bit about,
uh,

404
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,260
about drinking.
It's one of the best standard bits of

405
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:09,600
all time.
And he had a bit about Thanksgiving and

406
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:12,720
a skiing and they were all like 10
minutes and they would get funnier and

407
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:15,030
funnier.
And one day he said to me,

408
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,830
you know,
this is a job.

409
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,770
You got to sit down every day,
write jokes.

410
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,470
You don't just go to the mall and watch
a movie every day.

411
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,730
Like if you sat down for two hours at a
desk and treated this like it was a job

412
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,850
that deserves your respect,
you'll be a hundred times better than

413
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:33,240
everybody else.
And I did listen to his advice at the

414
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:34,830
time,
but I do now,

415
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,140
like now I sit down to write it up.

416
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,143
Yeah.
Yeah.

417
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,340
I do show up with like notes.
You're like one of the rare guys at the

418
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:42,870
comedy store,
he'll show up but notes.

419
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,660
Exactly.
I know nobody has notes.

420
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,870
If it has like a little like a business
card with three bullet points on it and

421
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,790
I'm a little more of the,
you know,

422
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:54,990
the shandling tons and tons of paper
until you're drowning and confused

423
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,220
shandling,
you know,

424
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,230
that's a sad one,
man.

425
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,180
Fun Dude that was oh the best.
And I'm doing a documentary about him

426
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:08,220
now for Hbo.
And so the most fun part about it is he

427
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:11,670
always went to the comedy magic club and
did stand up even in eras where you

428
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:14,970
didn't know he was doing it.
That's where I met him at the comedy

429
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,750
Magic Club.
And how was it?

430
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,120
I was great.
Yeah,

431
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,900
I mean it was like for me,
I was a huge fan of Larry Sanders show

432
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:24,410
and Larry Sanders show a,
that's where Paul Simms got start,

433
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,310
a producer of news radio.

434
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,290
And so when I,
you know,

435
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,720
when I saw him I was like,
it was one of those ones like,

436
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:31,800
oh wow,
that's a,

437
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,320
that's actually garry shandling right
there,

438
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,390
right there with judd apatow's right
there.

439
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,310
It's a weird one.
And He,

440
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,680
and you know the comedy magical,
they tape every show since the 80s they

441
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,230
have every show taped.
And I said,

442
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,360
can you give me the last 50 sets that
Gary did?

443
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,850
The comedy Magic Club.
And this is,

444
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,110
you know,
from the last few years.

445
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,040
And no one's ever seen any of these
jokes except that people at those shows,

446
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,140
he didn't do him on TV.
He didn't do them on talk shows.

447
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:01,950
There was no special,
some of the funniest jokes you've ever

448
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:02,910
heard.
Just him,

449
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,340
you know,
working on the craft.

450
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:09,600
How about going around being so funny.
Yeah,

451
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,340
but he,
he did a lot of notes.

452
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,870
He was a,
his discipline guy.

453
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,130
He was in the 70s he wrote so many
jokes.

454
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:22,020
I found these binders,
hundreds and hundreds of jokes in every

455
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,750
loose leaf binder.
Like a guy sitting at a desk all day

456
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,910
just crafting like two sentence perfect
jokes.

457
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,200
Yeah,
but there's like the balance,

458
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:32,070
right?
There's that.

459
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,580
There's crafting the perfect jokes and
then there's just being able to be loose

460
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,700
and fun and hilarious.
Well,

461
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:43,050
he also used to go on stage with a
justice setup and he wouldn't know the

462
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:45,720
punchline and he would say the setup and
hope the punchline came,

463
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,460
which is pretty wild.
He,

464
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:50,380
um,
you know,

465
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,240
one of the,
one of the great things about doing a

466
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:54,400
documentary as you get to ask people for
footage,

467
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:57,110
so Seinfeld gave me,
uh,

468
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,750
the dailies for Comedians in cars
getting coffee when he interviewed Gary.

469
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:06,190
And then the people who made the movie
comedian about Seinfeld gave me all the

470
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:10,930
dailies of a sequence that they only use
10 seconds of in the documentary,

471
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,790
which was Gary and Jerry going to the
comedy magic club and doing sets.

472
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:20,790
And also there that night as Neil and
Chris Rock and there's 12 tapes.

473
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,090
It's all their performances and then
their entire conversation for three

474
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:30,091
hours hanging out backstage.
And it is unbelievable the conversation,

475
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,710
how funny it is.
And,

476
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,890
uh,
there's a moment where Chris rock is

477
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:40,630
doing the joke about how Nelson Mandela
got divorced,

478
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,290
that even Nelson Mandela,
after decades of being in prison,

479
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,230
he could survive that,
but he couldn't survive getting out and

480
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:49,270
being married and gets divorced
immediately.

481
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,230
I forgot how he worded it,
but there's a shot of shandling alone in

482
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:58,231
a green room watching rock do this bit.
And as he's doing it,

483
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:02,830
Gary's I saying what he,
what he's like,

484
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,550
he's guessing what the bit is as rock
saying it,

485
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:11,551
but in awe of Chris Rock and it's a,
it's a really beautiful moment and

486
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:15,550
that's what the best part of doing in
this documentary is it just finding

487
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:19,330
little magical moments that no one would
ever see if you didn't dig deep.

488
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:24,420
What made you decide to do this?
And we did a memorial for Gary when he

489
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:29,431
died at the Wilshire Evil Theater and
like a thousand people showed up and I

490
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:34,471
made about five mini documentaries about
gary to show in between the speakers and

491
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,863
I thought,
oh,

492
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,660
this is a documentary.
I should just expand this.

493
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,530
And now it's like,
now it's like the Oj doc of Gary.

494
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,350
It's a big,
long epic documentary.

495
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,680
I think people don't realize how good
the Larry Sanders show us.

496
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,330
Yeah.
Like people forgot,

497
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,160
you know,
if he'd go back and watch it again,

498
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,290
that was a revolutionary show and it was
on the air.

499
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,190
It really was.
Well,

500
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:01,060
people don't go backwards.
Like my kids don't go backwards digging

501
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:03,070
that far.
Like to them,

502
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,450
you know,
looking backwards means I'll watch all

503
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:09,030
of parks and rec,
right.

504
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,900
They're not taking into the 90s.
Uh,

505
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,330
they go to 2015 and people forget that
when the Larry Sanders show came on the

506
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:17,164
air,
you know,

507
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:21,550
the shows on Hbo,
it was like a first and 10 are not

508
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:23,980
necessarily the news or dream on,
you know,

509
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:28,981
Gary was the first show on hbo that made
Hbo go,

510
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,870
Oh,
this is what hbo should be.

511
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,850
We should be the quality,
uh,

512
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,020
network with all,
with this kind of groundbreaking

513
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,300
television.
And,

514
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,230
uh,
you know,

515
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:43,660
Gary was a guy who got offered all the
talk shows.

516
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:46,180
He got offered to replace,
um,

517
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,740
he was hosting the tonight show for
Johnny.

518
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,870
Uh,
him and Leno would,

519
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,620
would,
uh,

520
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,540
take turns doing it and he decided he'd
rather satirize it then do it,

521
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,140
you know,
and he wanted to explore the people and

522
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:04,760
not be a talk show hosts.
He wanted to show like the world of ego

523
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,600
that is not just talk to us but just
show business.

524
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:11,060
He was fascinated with people's need for
attention,

525
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:14,240
his own need for attention,
his own vanity and narcissism.

526
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:19,241
And he wanted to explore that and,
and satirize how we just want to be

527
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:24,230
liked so badly.
Like what we do to be liked,

528
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:28,550
which prevents us from actually feeling
love cause we're so obsessed with

529
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,330
approval.

530
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,350
Do you talk to Jay?
Do you,

531
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:31,670
are you friends with Jay Leno?
Yeah,

532
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,710
Jane and I were talking about,
um,

533
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:36,650
what it was like to host the tonight
show and how much more funny has now

534
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,140
doing comedians and cars are not
comedians and cars.

535
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:40,440
A Jay Leno's garage.
Yes.

536
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,540
And because that's what he really loves
you and he really loves cars and he gets

537
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:47,110
to be himself while he's doing this.
He doesn't have to have people on it.

538
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:50,000
He doesn't want,
like he just has people want to talk to

539
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:53,750
them about cars and stuff and has comics
on and all kinds of people on.

540
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,390
But you know,
when he was talking about like having

541
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:58,640
that choice,
like you would have people on that,

542
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:01,310
you didn't give a shit about it and you
had to talk to them.

543
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:05,840
And for Jay that was most everybody
because he loves certain things,

544
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,370
but he doesn't love sports.

545
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,140
He's not a massive movie Fan.
But you got him going on the things he

546
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:15,290
cares about like cars.
He's fascinated.

547
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:18,380
But that I think was some of the fun of
watching the tonight show,

548
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,790
really interviewing a young actress and
you know,

549
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,630
he doesn't care at all.
And how is he going to make it abusing

550
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:30,260
for himself at the audience.
Did you see the hex bit that Hicks did

551
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:34,250
about Jay interviewing joy lawrence and
he blows his brains out and it forms the

552
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:36,770
NBC peacock or the wall.
I mean,

553
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:40,430
I always felt that could loads.
I always thought that was very unfair.

554
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:45,290
The Hicks and the Andy kindler
criticisms of Leno.

555
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,430
Leno was,
you know,

556
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,450
and as you know,
what are the great standups of all time?

557
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,440
I mean in a club you'd see letter in the
eighties nobody touches it.

558
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:56,900
He was just,
it was amazing fun guy and still,

559
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,280
I saw him recently at the abrupt still
is and you know,

560
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:04,520
he made a call to,
you know,

561
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:09,521
to be America's host,
beat everyone for forever.

562
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:15,410
Forever was proven completely correct.
But there was this idea that it was a

563
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:20,411
betrayal of his club persona that some
comedians were so mad about.

564
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,650
And I don't know how you could be mad at
anybody for deciding how to run their

565
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,650
show because you know,
as we've seen with other people,

566
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,870
sometimes snarky guy runs out of gas in
two years and you know,

567
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:39,710
jay found the space that was comfortable
for him and God was he nice to me every

568
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:42,830
time I was there.
He's a great guy and always super funny

569
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,310
when I was on the show and Super Nice
would put me on when I wasn't doing

570
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:50,130
stand up just as a director just because
he liked me as a person.

571
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,650
Um,
and uh,

572
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,220
and a really a good class guy and in the
Shanley documentary,

573
00:26:56,221 --> 00:27:00,090
fascinating describing his observations
of Gary,

574
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:03,010
his observations about talk shows,
uh,

575
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,500
I mean,
what a ride he went on.

576
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,080
Did that world of being a talk show
host.

577
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,870
There's not a lot of wiggle room,
especially back then,

578
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,040
you know,
as opposed to now.

579
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,950
Now with the Internet,
I think a lot of like subject matter and

580
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:17,010
a lot of language has opened up more.
You can kind of get it.

581
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:20,610
Like if you see like what's going on now
with,

582
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:24,110
uh,
with Seth Meyers or you know,

583
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,740
any of the other late night talk show
hosts,

584
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:30,180
they have much more relic look at core
bear gold bear rather coburn said that,

585
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,410
you know,
Donald Trump,

586
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:34,770
the president uses Putin.
Like he uses his mat,

587
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:36,990
like coop Putin uses his mouth as a cock
holster.

588
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,490
Like he said that on television with the
phrase cockles guess they beeped it out.

589
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,710
Do you not aware of that?
I'm not,

590
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,900
that's,
it was in the chrome,

591
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,910
the long rant.
And it was really hilarious because

592
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:49,020
trump,
trump,

593
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,180
uh,
came back and it said a bunch of,

594
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:54,300
think about cold bear and being
tasteless and talentless and being a

595
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:55,470
loser and all these different things.
Yeah.

596
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,540
And cold bear came back again.
He goes,

597
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,280
Donald Trump,
he goes,

598
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:02,610
I thought if there was one thing you
understood its shell business.

599
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,460
And he goes,
you responded.

600
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,570
He goes,
you responded.

601
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,640
I win.
You don't understand.

602
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:09,600
Oh fuck.
And it was,

603
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,860
it was really fucking cool.

604
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,960
Well,
trump can't help but respond.

605
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,150
Yeah.
He has no ability to go.

606
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,100
It demeans me to acknowledge you exist.
He doesn't understand that.

607
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,450
And so I think these easily baited into
any of those situations,

608
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:26,250
which is,
I think a little is what scares people

609
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:28,860
because you think if Cole bear can paid
him.

610
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:31,470
What about other countries and very
serious situations?

611
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:33,570
What,
what bates him into action that he

612
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:34,140
shouldn't

613
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,711
take?
Well,

614
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:36,380
he blocks people on twitter.
Yeah.

615
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,580
He's the fucking president.
People are trying to,

616
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,520
they're trying to figure out like is
that like a first amendment issue?

617
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:44,100
Like was it,
am I allowed to communicate with the

618
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:47,670
president directly through twitter?
Well now I can't cause he blocks me.

619
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:50,310
Is He allowed to block people?
So there's people that are considering

620
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:50,990
lawsuits right

621
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,080
now.
Does Donald Trump understand you should

622
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:56,960
just be muting people.
Just mute them.

623
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:58,620
Donald,
you don't have to block now.

624
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,840
He wants him to know what I'm going to
know Magda.

625
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,960
I like blocking people.
I love block and people in the second I

626
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:08,690
see anything I blocked somebody who even
if they say,

627
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,490
what am I?
Movies was just okay.

628
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:14,180
I didn't know have to be that main boom.
I'll never see you again.

629
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,650
Wow.
Really?

630
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,750
If somebody says that was who,
that was pretty good,

631
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:20,150
I'll block them.
Block them on almost a compliment.

632
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,980
Wow.
Almost looks weird.

633
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,260
Underhanded stuff.
You're not kissing my ass pretty hard.

634
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:25,440
You're gone.
That's,

635
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,610
that's my twitter theory online.
You know,

636
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,650
I don't even need you to call me a Jew.
That's the funny thing is that when

637
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:35,651
people say nasty things on twitter,
they always start sounding like they

638
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:38,900
make sense,
but then bail at the end,

639
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:40,280
you know,
so they'll just be like,

640
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,130
you know,
give,

641
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,600
give the president a chance.

642
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,000
You know,
[inaudible] was duly elected by the

643
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:48,580
American people and go jump in and
nothing.

644
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,220
It's always like the,
to beat the,

645
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,081
the,
Oh,

646
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:55,200
they're saying you,
it sounds sane and then it always lands

647
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,490
on jumping in oven.
Did you stop exactly that.

648
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,630
Go well.
Do you take a lot of heat for

649
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,770
criticizing the President [inaudible]
Jones?

650
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,160
I don't.
It's pretty soon.

651
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,470
I mean,
I don't think I'm saying anything that

652
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:12,400
anyone else's and saying because I have
a simple theory about all this stuff,

653
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:15,010
which is I don't think rich people want
you to be rich.

654
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:20,490
I think that people are trying to be
told that rich people really can handle

655
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:23,740
everything.
And if you let the rich people have all

656
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:25,690
the money that they're just going to
figure it all out.

657
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,880
And in fact,
last night was an interesting night

658
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:32,881
because of Donald Trump said he doesn't
want poor people in charge of the

659
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:35,260
economy and what,
what he said that,

660
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,250
yeah,
he said he goes,

661
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,540
I want rich people.

662
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:42,220
But it's what he's not understanding is
there are public servants who have not

663
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:46,390
made the choice to be billionaires who
actually understand the economic

664
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:48,720
theories better than,
you know,

665
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:53,650
the head of Walmart or something that
just because you were able to figure out

666
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:57,490
how to sell m and ms,
it doesn't mean you can run the economy.

667
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,890
That there are people that they don't
want to be rich,

668
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,950
they want to help other people.
And they are a very smart about ways to

669
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,010
help the government work well.
And you know,

670
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:12,070
that's like saying a Martin Luther
King's that loser because he wasn't

671
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:16,600
rich.
He's not smart and this only rich people

672
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:19,960
know how to do things.
I find so offensive.

673
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:24,990
And I'm very surprised that people who
aren't billionaires aren't more offended

674
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,190
at the contempt that they're held in.
Cause you could disagree on economic

675
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:31,750
theory.
You could say,

676
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:33,580
oh,
I believe in trickle down economics,

677
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:35,800
or I don't believe in trickle down
economics,

678
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,100
but this is a government that thinks if
you're not a billionaire,

679
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:39,970
you're an idiot.

680
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,200
I mean,
I think he thinks that I,

681
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,120
you said it last night,
it's just not easy.

682
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:46,030
It's a literally a speech,
which is,

683
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,720
would you want poor people in charge of
the economy?

684
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,320
Which is the argument for having like
the head of Goldman Sachs in charge of

685
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:54,460
the economy,
but yet,

686
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,980
what is a poor person?
How is he defining it?

687
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:01,981
Is he defining it as an idiot failure or
someone who hasn't decided to milk,

688
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,380
uh,
this world for as much money as they can

689
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,300
get out of it?
Some people are happy to make a

690
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:12,301
comfortable living and try to be giving
to other people and they can be very

691
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:14,170
helpful.
Uh,

692
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,800
being part of our government,
you don't have to be the head of Goldman

693
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,490
Sachs,
uh,

694
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,520
to be,
uh,

695
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,660
to be,
uh,

696
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,590
someone who can change people's lives
for the better.

697
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,630
He thinks you just get the head and neck
Exxon,

698
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:28,300
the had a Goldman Sachs,
but sometimes you don't want the head of

699
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:30,070
Exxon.
You want someone that's thought about

700
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:34,600
international relations their entire
lives and maybe they've always made 200

701
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:36,130
grand a year.
That doesn't,

702
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:37,640
that's not poor.
Like what the,

703
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:39,750
it depends on what your,
how you define that core

704
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,740
and how he defines poor.
Yeah.

705
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,090
I mean when you say you don't want to
pour person running the economy,

706
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:47,930
I think one argument for that would be
you don't want anybody who wants radical

707
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:50,060
redistribution of wealth.
One article,

708
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,410
one Om argument while that rather it
would be someone who says like what we

709
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:58,100
need to do is we need to figure out who
the richest people in the world that own

710
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,640
90% of the money and then just take that
money and distributed to everyone else.

711
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,740
Like this is,
there's some pretty radical arguments

712
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:04,360
from Portland.

713
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,460
Well,
I don't think he's saying that.

714
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,860
I say I think he equates poor with
idiot.

715
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,800
He wasn't saying,
I don't want the,

716
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,540
you know,
a Bernie Sanders type.

717
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,040
He was saying,
I want,

718
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,000
he considers like the head of Goldman
Sachs to be the smartest man in the

719
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:20,940
world,
where there are people who,

720
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:26,150
who don't seek to make that much money,
who are very smart and certainly capable

721
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:29,190
of doing things.
I think he sees people who are not the

722
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:34,191
heads of industry as being incapable of
being in charge of aspects of the

723
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:34,980
government.
Right?

724
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,790
Because that's his world because this
world is the world of super rich people.

725
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:41,160
And if you're not a super rich person,
you're a loser.

726
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:41,881
Well,
that's the thing.

727
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:43,440
It's all a winner,
loser economy,

728
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:46,920
which I find fascinating because he is
basically calling most of the world the

729
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:50,010
loser in his world.
And so yeah,

730
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:50,730
you could debate.

731
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,310
I mean,
I always think most people don't even

732
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:56,610
understand most of what they talk about
with politics.

733
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,040
Like when you talk about wealth
redistribution that a lot of people are

734
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,850
fisheries,
but they actually don't know anything

735
00:34:02,851 --> 00:34:04,470
about,
uh,

736
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,590
they have no information that the,
no one's read a book about it.

737
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,230
And it has very few,
very few.

738
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:15,090
I mean literally less than 1% and 1% are
arguing about on a regular basis.

739
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:18,390
They've seen a few clips on Fox News and
they have this idea in their head of

740
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,910
what it is exactly.
And I think that's what's wrong with our

741
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:24,000
country is no one knows anything about
anything on either side.

742
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,010
Like people don't know,
uh,

743
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,020
you know,
deeply about,

744
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,760
uh,
the environment.

745
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,460
There's very few people who sit down and
read the study.

746
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:37,790
Very few people right now are going to
read that healthcare bill that is before

747
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:39,150
the Senate.
Right?

748
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,450
Like how many people do you think,
what percentage of the country think is

749
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,710
going to sit down and read any part of
it?

750
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,510
Less than one 10th of 1% and destroy
their lives if they get sick and they

751
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:52,170
don't have coverage and who knows,
maybe it's perfect and we don't

752
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:55,950
understand it,
but people won't bother to know anything

753
00:34:55,951 --> 00:34:56,784
about it.

754
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:57,843
Warming.
Yeah.

755
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,300
You talk to the average person on the
right or the average person on the left

756
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:04,210
about global warming,
and you will see like it's really

757
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:08,650
strange how you see these ideologically
driven ideas that they have in their

758
00:35:08,651 --> 00:35:11,530
head about what global warming is,
what causes it.

759
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:14,170
And you can almost guess based on their
reaction to it,

760
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:16,330
whether they're republican or whether
they're liberal.

761
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,890
Yes.
And people,

762
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,750
you know,
obviously everyone talks about this,

763
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:23,770
but people have chosen the side.
And so now anything that that side does,

764
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,240
people are okay with it.
Yeah.

765
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:31,620
And so we suddenly were so soft on
Russia and then all these,

766
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:33,700
you know,
the being a republican used to be so

767
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:37,980
about the evil empire and on a dime,
it's like people like

768
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,641
Russia.
Well,

769
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:40,620
look what they did with Wiki leaks.
Wiki leaks,

770
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:43,800
everyone's turned on Wiki leaks.
Wiki leaks used to be the champion of

771
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:45,150
information.
He's to be,

772
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:48,360
these are the people that are trying to
let you know all the shit that's going

773
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:50,400
on behind the scenes.
We're finding out all these secret

774
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:52,050
emails,
we're sharing them with the world.

775
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:52,830
We're,
we're,

776
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,380
we're,
we have a media dumped,

777
00:35:54,381 --> 00:35:59,040
there were dumping everything.
Now it's Wiki leaks is Putin's puppet

778
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,220
and wikileaks is working for Putin.
The left is turned on.

779
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:06,510
Wiki leaks was quite fascinating.
Well both sides we'll switch based on

780
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:09,120
what serves them in the moment.
Yeah.

781
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:11,460
But it's dark man.
It's really weird when you see,

782
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,380
when you see it so obvious and it's so
flippant,

783
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,360
like there's not a lot of thought put
into this.

784
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:21,090
Like you're talking about someone like
Julian the size.

785
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,550
I'm not a giant Julian assange fan as a
human being,

786
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,760
but I think what he's done is pretty
goddamn courageous and he's taken a huge

787
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,450
hit for it.

788
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,640
I mean,
he's been stuck in this embassy in

789
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:34,200
London forever.
If he leaves,

790
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:37,170
he will immediately be arrested and who
knows what's going to happen to them if

791
00:36:37,171 --> 00:36:38,410
that happens.
So this is,

792
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,490
and this guy is still out there trying
to distribute information.

793
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,320
Well it's about is it's selective,
you know,

794
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:47,160
if a guy like that is just,
I mean obviously the issues are,

795
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,300
is he putting people's lives at risk
with w mega dumps,

796
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:54,390
which reveal sources and things like
that.

797
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,860
But also is he,
is he manipulated to release things to

798
00:36:58,861 --> 00:37:01,740
serve a different,
you know,

799
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,800
political.
Is he doing it on purpose in one way or

800
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:06,750
the other?
Is the stuff on the Republicans?

801
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:07,710
You know,
if we had all the,

802
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,860
all the emails of the Republican's
planning the trump campaign,

803
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,530
uh,
we'd have a whole nother story to tell.

804
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,320
Now,
is it impossible to get their emails?

805
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,250
Do they just have the best computers in
the world and there's no way to get

806
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:22,620
their emails or it depends on what the
story is.

807
00:37:22,621 --> 00:37:23,170
Like,
you know,

808
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,170
that they believe,
I mean,

809
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:26,760
it's,
it's so hard to figure out what happened

810
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,860
here,
but that seth rich guy,

811
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,850
according to Kim Dotcom and according to
Julian assange,

812
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,770
he leaked,
he was a Bernie Sanders supporter.

813
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,590
He worked for the DNC.
He leaked some of the information that

814
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:42,591
showed that the DNC was colluding and
what they were trying to do was a con.

815
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,930
They were conspiring to keep Bernie
Sanders from winning the primary.

816
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,630
And it proved to be true that that they
actually did do that.

817
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,490
And Julian Assange,
uh,

818
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,870
was setting after that guy got shot,
that somehow or another,

819
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:56,880
he was alluding to that if you work with
us,

820
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:59,310
there are consequences.
So you had someone who was a,

821
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,160
a renegade inside the DNC who released
that dump.

822
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,430
You don't have anybody like that on the
Republican side.

823
00:38:05,431 --> 00:38:08,970
It doesn't mean that the wikileaks is
corrupt.

824
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,850
It just means that no one on the
republican side has done that.

825
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,040
Only one guy,
according to them,

826
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,390
I don't know if it's true,
they,

827
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,900
some people say Russia did it,
but according to Julian assange and

828
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:23,160
according to Kim Dotcom was apparently
somehow or another involved at least

829
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:25,380
part of it had to do with this seth rich
guy.

830
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:30,740
That doesn't mean that they're like
trying to exclusively released stuff

831
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,740
than makes Democrats like bad.
It just means no one's done it on the

832
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:36,430
republican side.
Just because the information doesn't

833
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:38,380
exist,
it doesn't mean there's some sort of

834
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:39,820
collusion.
Well,

835
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:41,320
that's the,
I guess the mystery of it.

836
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,300
I don't even know anything about the
seth rich case.

837
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:43,961
What,
what does that,

838
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:45,160
cause I know people are mad about us.

839
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,820
That guy that was,
he worked for the DNC and he was

840
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:52,200
murdered outside of his apartment at
four o'clock in the morning.

841
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,140
They said it was a robbery,
but he,

842
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,370
there's a giant conspiracy theory to
attach to it,

843
00:38:57,371 --> 00:39:00,610
but I'm just going to relay the facts.
His wallet was left,

844
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:02,800
his phone was left,
his watch was left,

845
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,040
his valuables,
that he might have been robbed of his

846
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,200
monies.
All that stuff was there.

847
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:11,110
So he's just murdered and they never
found who killed him.

848
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:16,290
And then immediately Julian assange was
alluding to the idea that this guy was

849
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:18,820
helping them and that he was murdered
because that,

850
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,900
and that has been hotly
contested.

851
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:24,520
And of course,
uh,

852
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,990
the Fox News narrative has like gotten,
like Sean Hannity has made a big deal

853
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,210
out of it saying that he said,
we're going to get to the bottom of

854
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:32,044
this,
ladies and gentlemen,

855
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,750
which makes me more suspicious and it's
not true,

856
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:40,170
but it is a possibility that he was one
of the people that was releasing

857
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,050
information.

858
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,000
I would imagine if you worked for the
DNC,

859
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:46,810
especially if you were a Bernie Sanders
supporter and you saw what they were

860
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:49,030
doing,
what they were doing is essentially they

861
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:50,830
were,
they were hijacking the democratic

862
00:39:50,831 --> 00:39:53,800
process from inside,
from the Democratic Party.

863
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:55,540
Yeah.
And if you were a Bernie sanders

864
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,910
supporter,
it would be horrifying and it would

865
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:00,550
really piss you off.
And especially if you're someone who's

866
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,420
idealistic,
you've got this idea of like what the

867
00:40:04,421 --> 00:40:08,530
future could be under Bernie Sanders and
you realize your own party is fucking

868
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,210
him in the ass.
And so,

869
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,720
uh,
I don't know how much he released or if

870
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:16,900
he released or if he was only one part
of it or Russia was a part of it as

871
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:18,400
well.
And hacking into the DNC.

872
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,730
But the bottom line at the end of the
day is it exposed corruption.

873
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,990
I mean that's really what it was.
There's absolute clear corruption in the

874
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:28,420
DNC and everybody got away with it.

875
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:31,060
The woman who was in charge,
she went and left and went immediately

876
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,240
to work for Hillary's campaign.
And you know,

877
00:40:33,241 --> 00:40:35,050
it's,
it wasn't good stuff.

878
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:38,590
It was all bad no matter what.
No matter who really released it.

879
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,900
It just showed you how gross the system
is.

880
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:42,340
Yeah.
To the core.

881
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,480
Yeah.
All the way around.

882
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,880
On both sides.
Cause I'm not a big conspiracy theorist.

883
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:47,980
I should be.
But why should you be?

884
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,690
I guess that there's always more going
on than we think.

885
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,960
But I also think that most people are
too dumb to not get caught almost every

886
00:40:57,971 --> 00:40:59,320
single time.
Yeah.

887
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:01,540
You say that,
but there's a lot of shit that happens

888
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:04,300
where people do get caught eventually
and you realize,

889
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,040
oh,
like how long were you guys running

890
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,780
this?
What's your favorite conspiracy theory

891
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:11,620
that turned out to be true?
It's hard to say whether it turned out

892
00:41:11,621 --> 00:41:13,990
to be true,
but JFK is the biggest one.

893
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,540
And where did you land on that?
I landed on that.

894
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:21,070
It's very possible,
very possible that Lee Harvey Oswald was

895
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:23,530
involved.
It's very possible that other people

896
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:27,250
involved too.
It's very possible that he shot at

897
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:31,600
Kennedy and other people shot at Kennedy
at the same time that and then he was a

898
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:36,601
patsy and he was put like,
he was obviously involved in a lot of

899
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:40,490
intelligence agency shenanigans.
He went to Russia,

900
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:42,950
he married a Russian woman,
came back to the United States.

901
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,550
He had been involved in all sorts of
communists,

902
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:51,050
propaganda shit.
He was definitely not like an above

903
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:55,400
ground guy.
He was a shady dude and it's entirely

904
00:41:55,401 --> 00:42:00,050
possible that he was one person out of a
plot to kill the president and they put

905
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:02,150
it all on him and they had Jack Ruby
shoot him.

906
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,310
But everybody goes black and white on
that.

907
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:07,790
You either go Lee Harvey Oswald acted
alone or you go,

908
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:11,960
he was innocent and the CIA had him
assassinated because he was trying to

909
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:14,180
get rid of the CIA,
which he was.

910
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,710
I mean,
Kennedy was trying to pull us out of

911
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:17,390
Vietnam,
was trying to get rid of the CIA.

912
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:19,680
He was trying to get rid of the uh,
the um,

913
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,350
uh,
the,

914
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,350
the Federal Reserve here.
There was a lot of like super

915
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:28,400
controversial ideas that Kennedy was
trying to push forward and someone

916
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:30,470
killed him.
I always go to the simple thing,

917
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:33,260
which is why would Jack Ruby shoot him?
Right?

918
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,760
Yeah.
Cause a lot of people say,

919
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:35,900
oh,
he was just a patriot.

920
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:39,320
We've got mad and happened to be there.
But I,

921
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,460
which maybe makes perfect sense,
but if he was told to do it,

922
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,420
it's such a suicide end up in jail for
the rest of your life mission.

923
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,460
It doesn't matter to me.
It falls.

924
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,720
Things like that fall apart there.
That's what they do.

925
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,650
But it's also possible they told him,
listen,

926
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:56,210
just shoot him,
we'll get you off.

927
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,060
We'll,
we'll,

928
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,390
we'll,
we'll find some sort of a way.

929
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:01,490
Like,
or they might've had something horrible

930
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:04,160
on him.
Jack Ruby was clearly embedded in the

931
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:07,430
mob.
The mob was angry at Kennedy because

932
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:11,000
they helped Kennedy when they helped him
win Illinois.

933
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,600
You know what I mean?
They helped him become the president and

934
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,160
there was absolute evidence that they
were mad at him once he became president

935
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:21,530
because then he started doing things
that were against their interest.

936
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,660
There was a lot of people pissed off at
Kennedy.

937
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,580
That's what's funny about the current
Russia scandal because it's a similar

938
00:43:28,581 --> 00:43:30,440
thing where there's just so much going
on.

939
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,710
I keep saying that people,
you're not hearing this defense from all

940
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:34,880
the trump people.
Well,

941
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:39,881
we met with Peru eight times.
We met with English people like they are

942
00:43:40,941 --> 00:43:45,941
just that having those meetings,
there's not all those connections with

943
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:49,090
any other country,
but Russia not only that,

944
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,230
this whole thing about Flynn and that
the,

945
00:43:51,231 --> 00:43:56,180
the intelligence agencies were warning
that Flynn was compromised and that the,

946
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:59,210
he could be blackmailed by Russia.
Like they had things on him,

947
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,100
what they had on him,
we don't know,

948
00:44:01,101 --> 00:44:06,101
but they're very convinced that there
was evidence against Flynn and that the

949
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:09,650
trump administration knew this and they
were still entertaining talks with them.

950
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:12,680
They're still bringing him on board.
And what's fascinating is this world of

951
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,310
international lobbyists,
like Paul Manafort,

952
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,430
what are they doing?
Did you,

953
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,940
did you see this a thing where Paul
manafort's kids,

954
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:26,960
someone hack their phones and they had
all these texts where they were talking

955
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:29,770
about how horrible their dad was.
Oh,

956
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,130
and how he's responsible for

957
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,370
people getting killed.
Oh No.

958
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:38,400
And they're seeing,
and who knows if any of that's true,

959
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,520
but there's a higher world of Americans
going overseas and being involved in

960
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:48,500
dirty politics and the work of,
uh,

961
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:53,520
governments like the Ukraine that we
don't have any clue about what that is.

962
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,560
Yeah.
It's on the last frontiers for really

963
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:57,930
diabolical shit.
You know,

964
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:01,140
like Russia is one of the last,
like what he had,

965
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,840
what he is,
what Putin stands for is,

966
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,900
uh,
like one of the last brutal military

967
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:09,390
dictators.
It's kind of in a costume.

968
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,030
Yes,
he's in a costume as the president of

969
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:13,620
Russia,
but we all know,

970
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,600
like,
he murders people that oppose him.

971
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,250
He murders journalists,
he murders political candidates that are

972
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,350
running against him.
I mean,

973
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,340
he's,
he's terrifying guy.

974
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,870
But what do you think it means that that
trump just love some just not good.

975
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,050
He just,
he did Myers.

976
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,000
I think he admires the take no shit guy.
Yeah,

977
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:38,001
I think he does and I think there's also
the possibility that he feels that what

978
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:43,110
Putin stands for is like he's a this
powerful superpower and it's better to

979
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:45,240
be friends with them than it is to be
enemies.

980
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,530
Let's just cozy up,
hey,

981
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:48,210
I wish I could do a lot of the shit you
do.

982
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,950
A lot of people talk shit about me on
twitter.

983
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,690
I wish I could have him killed.
I mean it's entirely possible that he

984
00:45:54,691 --> 00:45:59,430
thinks along those lines because I think
it's probably from decades of trump

985
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:03,960
dealing with the mob in New York and
Atlantic city and he probably developed

986
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,840
a point of view about how you deal with
evil people.

987
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,840
Yeah.
And how you have to make deals and how

988
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:13,620
friends with them.
I think a lot of rich people think

989
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,890
everyone doesn't understand this is how
the world works.

990
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,280
This is how the sausage gets made and
that's why they do crazy stuff because

991
00:46:23,341 --> 00:46:27,310
they just go,
everyone else is naive and just get me

992
00:46:27,311 --> 00:46:29,040
in a room with and get me a back
channel.

993
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,350
We'll figure it out.
Like right.

994
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,630
The back channel with cushner,
it's like sitting down with a mob

995
00:46:33,631 --> 00:46:38,150
figuring out your price for cement.
That's what he thinks the Putin back

996
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,440
channel is.
I believe we will figure it out.

997
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:40,891
We'll,
we'll,

998
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:43,950
we'll come up with,
and I think it seems like trump likes

999
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:48,951
the idea of that what you present is a
lie and what you do in private is

1000
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:54,450
figuring out solutions and that that's
how the world works and that it's all

1001
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:55,860
full of shit.
Yeah,

1002
00:46:55,861 --> 00:46:58,710
and that that is the way you get away
with everything.

1003
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,930
That's how the world works.
That's a justification.

1004
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:02,580
Hey,
it's how the world works,

1005
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:08,090
which is so different than Bush who was
religious and had this thought,

1006
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,440
we are going to go to other countries.

1007
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:15,710
We're going to take down these leaders
and they are going to find freedom and

1008
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:21,300
we're all going to change for the
positive when they don't have these

1009
00:47:21,301 --> 00:47:24,180
dictators.
Trump is an old school guy who's like,

1010
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,180
you need the dictators to keep all these
assholes in line.

1011
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,650
Yeah.
But meanwhile he's kind of right.

1012
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,360
I mean,
look what happens when you take the

1013
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:33,550
dictators out.
You create this power vacuum and the

1014
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:36,040
places are way more chaotic.
Look at Libya,

1015
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,750
right?
It's a failed state now.

1016
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,000
He got rid of Qaddafi.
Everybody's happy.

1017
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,790
Hillary Clinton was on TV.
They did an interview with her where

1018
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:45,670
she's cheering.
She's like laughing at a week came,

1019
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:48,250
we saw he died.
Ha Ha.

1020
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,450
Do you see that?
Oh yes.

1021
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:53,770
The air thing.
I think that's what makes the world so

1022
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:56,160
impossible to manage right now.
Right.

1023
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,110
Which is,
you know,

1024
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,150
it's like,
we tried this,

1025
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:02,280
this,
you know,

1026
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:06,910
this approach of let's,
let's make these people a democracy,

1027
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,670
but you can't force people to want a
democracy.

1028
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,800
Also,
they're conditioned to being in a

1029
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:14,500
dictatorship.
They've lived that way their whole life,

1030
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,380
and there's all these other people.
When you get rid of Qaddafi,

1031
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:19,450
it doesn't mean he's the only piece of
shit there.

1032
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,840
There's a million other pieces of shit
that are wondering how they get to that

1033
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:27,040
guy's position and he's keeping them
down and murdering people and trying to

1034
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,080
keep keeping.
And so their entire life,

1035
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,970
that's the paradigm they've operated
under.

1036
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:35,620
They've watched this happen,
they've seen this one central brutal,

1037
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,220
murderous figure control everyone else.
And when that's gone,

1038
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:42,010
it's not all Kumbaya.
All the sudden it creates this power

1039
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:45,370
vacuum and then everybody's clamoring to
see who takes that guy spot.

1040
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,600
And now you have isis steps in and Libya
is just straight chaos.

1041
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:55,050
And there's seems to be no solution to
almost no solution,

1042
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,430
right?
Because there's a,

1043
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:01,440
there's a massive religious tribal war
happening where if we,

1044
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,220
if we didn't exist,
they were,

1045
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,480
they would just be fighting each other.

1046
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,500
Right?
And that's what happened.

1047
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:07,510
That's what we were warned about with
Iraq.

1048
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,270
Like people that didn't understand Iraq,
including Bush,

1049
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,970
did not understand.
If you take Saddam Hussein out of the

1050
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:14,830
picture,
who is kind of secular,

1051
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,910
what you're left with is this Sunni Shia
up civil war.

1052
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,820
And you're going to have this crazy
situation where there's two different

1053
00:49:21,821 --> 00:49:26,020
sects of Islam are going to kill each
other and no one saw that coming.

1054
00:49:26,021 --> 00:49:27,370
I mean,
well you know who did see that coming?

1055
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:28,990
Janeane Garofalo she,
yeah,

1056
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:31,480
cause I remember watching her on CNN and
there was a,

1057
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:36,700
there was a massive protest against
going into Iraq before we went to war.

1058
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,260
And she said,
this is what's going to happen if we go

1059
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:42,790
there.
And she laid that out.

1060
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,500
Well,
she's a Noam Chomsky Fan.

1061
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,393
Yeah.
She said,

1062
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:47,260
these people are going to attack each
other.

1063
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:48,280
We're going to create a mess.

1064
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:52,120
That is going to be,
we're gonna open a Pandora's box and

1065
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:55,720
there are no weapons of mass destruction
and we should wait and we don't have

1066
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:59,050
enough information.
And she really took a beating,

1067
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:01,690
uh,
for being,

1068
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:05,230
uh,
in strong opposition to invading Iraq.

1069
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,410
And every single thing that you said
would happen in the next 10 years.

1070
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,790
It happened.
And she wasn't the only person.

1071
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,000
There were plenty of people.
I remember when nine 11 happened,

1072
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,130
Norman mailer was on,
uh,

1073
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:19,990
he was on Charlie rose like that week.
And he said,

1074
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:23,980
this is exactly what's going to happen.
And he explained the wars that would

1075
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:25,570
happen,
where they would happen.

1076
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,890
He,
and then he,

1077
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,040
and this is what's gonna happen

1078
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,040
as a result of those wars and,
and laid out the mess that was created.

1079
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:34,521
And he said,
you'll see,

1080
00:50:34,521 --> 00:50:37,250
we,
we do not have the strength to not take

1081
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:38,780
these steps.
I should clarify.

1082
00:50:38,781 --> 00:50:40,390
I don't know if Janine's uh,
uh,

1083
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:40,900
really,
uh,

1084
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,850
Noam Chomsky Fan,
but I know chumps Chomsky was saying

1085
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:45,620
that like,
he was pretty adamant about that.

1086
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:49,640
Like very early on,
I just watched the Chomsky documentary

1087
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:51,980
on Netflix.
It's an interesting guy.

1088
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,230
Yeah.
And it was fascinating and it had one

1089
00:50:54,231 --> 00:50:56,420
simple idea,
which also I think a lot of people don't

1090
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:57,890
realize,
uh,

1091
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:03,250
which is just that our country,
how it's set up is,

1092
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:09,730
is meant to protect people from the
people with money from the land owners.

1093
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:15,040
As it was more back then.
And the basic theory is that

1094
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:22,400
the people with the wealth and
corporations are not served by

1095
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:25,220
democracy.
If democracy is functioning,

1096
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:30,790
it is not in the favor of the wealthy or
corporate interests.

1097
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:35,810
And so as a result,
they always have to be against democracy

1098
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,830
because if they're,
if,

1099
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:41,000
if Republicans don't have voter
suppression,

1100
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,770
then everything is going to change in
favor of what the population wants to

1101
00:51:45,771 --> 00:51:49,610
do.
So that they'll always be incentives for

1102
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:53,870
having less people vote and to,
to making democracy not function the way

1103
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:58,070
that it should.
Cause clearly you could have voter motor

1104
00:51:58,071 --> 00:52:00,050
id where the,
when you get your driver's license,

1105
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,530
you're registered for the whole country.
You could have everyone in the country

1106
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:05,540
vote by mail,
you can have everyone vote by computer,

1107
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:07,610
you can make it.
So we'd have 80,

1108
00:52:07,611 --> 00:52:11,420
90% of the people voting.
But that goes against corporate

1109
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:15,020
interests.
And so they fight to say,

1110
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:16,580
uh,
there's,

1111
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,920
you know,
all these fake votes when there,

1112
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,310
there isn't.
And so that protects corporate

1113
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:23,630
interests.
And it's a,

1114
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:28,160
it's a really interesting documentary
that just came up I guess in the last

1115
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:28,520
year.

1116
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,500
What's it called?
Um,

1117
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,350
oh,
we're about to find out.

1118
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:35,390
It's,
I see.

1119
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:37,590
I liked it.
The computers to searching as we speak.

1120
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,210
A lot of people that are resisting the
idea of people voting online.

1121
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,520
But we bank online.
It's ridiculous.

1122
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:47,300
Of course she'd be able to vote while we
certainly could get more people voting.

1123
00:52:47,301 --> 00:52:51,200
It's fascinating that there's other
countries like Russia trying to get into

1124
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:51,561
that.
Oh,

1125
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:54,410
requiem for the American dream.
Uh,

1126
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:54,831
yeah.
It's,

1127
00:52:54,831 --> 00:52:57,740
it's worth it.
It's worth seeing.

1128
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:58,821
I mean,
I,

1129
00:52:58,821 --> 00:52:59,740
I don't really,
you know,

1130
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:03,560
some of these things I don't have the
strongest opinions on because it's

1131
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:06,320
pretty,
it's very complicated and it's like you

1132
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:07,154
said,
you just,

1133
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,960
you never know what new,
messier creating.

1134
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:10,880
I was talking to this actor,
right?

1135
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:13,430
Um,
who does a lot of charity work around

1136
00:53:13,431 --> 00:53:14,930
the world,
very famous actor.

1137
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:15,891
And he said,
you know,

1138
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:16,910
I was working,
uh,

1139
00:53:16,911 --> 00:53:20,240
on this project to dig wells and a
community in Africa.

1140
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:26,020
And then we dug the wells and his
incredible for this community and

1141
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:31,130
then the neighboring community came and
murdered everybody for the wells.

1142
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:34,530
He goes,
that's what it's like trying to save

1143
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:38,310
people and to help people in the world.
There's always something that results

1144
00:53:38,311 --> 00:53:42,540
that you did not anticipate that makes
it even more complicated.

1145
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,760
And I feel it's that way with most
issues that you think it's this,

1146
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:52,050
but you've set off that and uh,
and it takes,

1147
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,690
I would,
where I come down is you need an

1148
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:57,840
incredibly intelligent person to be in
the middle of making these choices.

1149
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,580
And just generally with trump,
I don't think he's that smart and I

1150
00:54:02,581 --> 00:54:04,710
think that he is very,
you know,

1151
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:09,570
very self-involved,
narcissistic person and we can debate,

1152
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,400
uh,
choices,

1153
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:16,580
but it doesn't seem like the,
like the person who has the depth to

1154
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,270
make these calls.
Well,

1155
00:54:18,271 --> 00:54:22,800
I don't think anybody really is
qualified to run 350 million people.

1156
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,780
I just think it's a ridiculous
proposition,

1157
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,190
but I think you're definitely right.

1158
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,030
Also,
he,

1159
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:31,030
he sets the tone for the mindset of the
country.

1160
00:54:31,031 --> 00:54:32,910
Yeah.
I mean it really is.

1161
00:54:32,911 --> 00:54:37,911
We have this Alpha male chimpanzee thing
going on where the one like robot Momma

1162
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,940
love him or hate him,
was a very articulate,

1163
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:44,700
really well spoken calm and measured
guy.

1164
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:49,560
And I think that's very good for America
to have this guy who's smarter than

1165
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:52,590
anybody you know,
and he's running the country like you

1166
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:53,401
feel like,
okay,

1167
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:55,050
well this guy is obviously,
look,

1168
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,300
he,
he hardly ever stutters.

1169
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,060
He knows what he's talking about.
And very moderate.

1170
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,250
I mean,
when you get down to it,

1171
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:07,251
what I find interesting is Obama was so
moderate after the banking issues,

1172
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:10,620
he didn't go after the bankers.
He didn't send anyone to jail.

1173
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:15,750
He propped up those businesses.
So the fact that the banks so want to

1174
00:55:15,751 --> 00:55:19,830
get rid of him,
it makes me go how much money is enough,

1175
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,040
right?

1176
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,420
This guy's still basically on your side.
Hillary's basically still on your side.

1177
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,080
They were mad when their bonuses where
minimalized.

1178
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:28,770
Yeah,
remember that.

1179
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:32,160
Exactly.
I think that they got billions of

1180
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,200
dollars in bail money and they still
wanted their bonuses.

1181
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:37,470
I have a contract,
my contract says I got a bonus or just

1182
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:41,310
thinking about their house and their
yacht and people got bonuses even though

1183
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,920
the economy collapsed,
even though the economy class as a

1184
00:55:43,921 --> 00:55:48,030
direct result of the industry that they
were involved in and the businesses they

1185
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:50,070
were running,
they still got bonuses.

1186
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,270
It's really crazy and it was interesting
is that I guess most people,

1187
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,820
they don't connect that and they're not
furious.

1188
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:59,280
Like right now they're trying to get rid
of the compute,

1189
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,380
the Consumer Protection Bureau that
keeps an eye on the bank.

1190
00:56:03,381 --> 00:56:06,030
So they're trying to Defang them.
And Pete,

1191
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,760
you would think that people who want
their guns would also say,

1192
00:56:08,761 --> 00:56:11,880
but I would like consumer protection so
you don't screw me out of my credit

1193
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:12,491
card.
Right.

1194
00:56:12,491 --> 00:56:14,760
But for some reason,
because it doesn't align it with their

1195
00:56:14,761 --> 00:56:16,230
team.
Exactly.

1196
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,020
They don't care about the issues that
are,

1197
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,720
that would protect them.
Isn't that super dangerous to have a

1198
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:23,890
right and a left I,
it's just

1199
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:26,500
cause you always do,
you go for independent candidates a lot.

1200
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:28,680
Right.
You're looking for a third party and

1201
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:31,930
what prevents there from being a logical
third party?

1202
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,690
Well,
I think we had it with Ross Perot,

1203
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,120
right?
I think Ross Perot was a logical third

1204
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:38,920
party and it became very dangerous for
people.

1205
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:41,170
And that's one of the reasons why the
commission for presidential debates

1206
00:56:41,171 --> 00:56:43,540
changed the threshold.
Like you back then,

1207
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:46,960
you needed 5% in the primary in order to
be included in the debates.

1208
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:49,120
You put Ross Perot and the debate is an,
uh,

1209
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:54,200
an independent [inaudible] extremely
wealthy man who understands a lot about

1210
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:56,350
tax codes,
understands a lot about foreign

1211
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:59,200
relations,
and he became like a huge problem and

1212
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:01,720
most likely cost.
Uh,

1213
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,690
Herbert Walker Bush his second term,
right?

1214
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,520
Yes.
And then that's why Clinton became

1215
00:57:06,521 --> 00:57:08,950
president in the first place.
And the threshold is what now to get

1216
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:11,620
into those debates,
Bernie Sanders is kind of an

1217
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:12,640
independent,
right?

1218
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,430
I mean,
he's obviously that his parties not on

1219
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,470
his side,
and we proved that with the DNC leaks

1220
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,810
that they're,
they're conspiring against him.

1221
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:23,620
This is his actual own party,
which is the same as changing the

1222
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:26,290
thresholds of the third party candidate.
Can't be in the debates.

1223
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:26,740
Right,
right.

1224
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,960
It's just another version of that.
Exactly.

1225
00:57:28,961 --> 00:57:30,580
Yeah.
It's another version of that.

1226
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,270
Well then you find out the condition for
presidential debates is I,

1227
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:37,330
it's,
it's not even a national thing.

1228
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:40,150
It's like a privately funded thing.
It's a,

1229
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:44,650
it's a private company.
Like they can choose like how they like

1230
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:45,251
what like,
oh,

1231
00:57:45,251 --> 00:57:48,250
let's make it 15%.
You have to get 15% and then they could

1232
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:50,350
just change it.
Like that guy was a problem.

1233
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,110
That guy was a pain in the ass.
Let's change the threshold.

1234
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,160
Yeah.
What could go wrong?

1235
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:55,300
Yeah.
Are you,

1236
00:57:55,570 --> 00:58:00,570
I mean there are people who feel like
left and right are the same thing when

1237
00:58:02,051 --> 00:58:07,051
you really get down to it or they're
protecting the same interests in some

1238
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:07,954
way.

1239
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,100
Are you a believer in that or not?
I think that the,

1240
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:15,070
most of the people that are on the left
and most of the people on the right

1241
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:18,970
aren't even really thinking about
whatever their party stands for.

1242
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:21,730
They are just like they said,
they are sticking with the team,

1243
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,560
whether it's the left team,
have the right team.

1244
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:24,890
I think,
um,

1245
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:28,900
I think radical ideologies,
whether it's on the left or the right,

1246
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:32,150
will they share a lot of common traits.
And one of the things that they share is

1247
00:58:32,151 --> 00:58:34,600
the,
this complete lack of objectivity,

1248
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,770
lack of objectivity and lack of
introspective thought in terms of like

1249
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,710
what their party is actually doing and
what it means to be a liberal,

1250
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:44,440
what it means to be progressive,
what it means to be Republican,

1251
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:48,190
what it means to be conservative.
You just get into this groove like this

1252
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,320
is what we do,
fuck global warming.

1253
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,610
It's not real.
You know,

1254
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,880
and then fuck this and you can't be
racist against a white person.

1255
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:57,280
Like you.
People have these ridiculous ideas on

1256
00:58:57,281 --> 00:59:00,520
the left and on the right.
They just dig their heels in the sand.

1257
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:02,710
They didn't even think about and they
just go with it because that's what the

1258
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:05,880
party says.
And it's just the game because they have

1259
00:59:05,881 --> 00:59:09,520
kind of election night,
I called a lot of politicians and a

1260
00:59:09,521 --> 00:59:11,890
bunch of journalists was just trying to
get a sense of what's going on.

1261
00:59:11,891 --> 00:59:13,900
How could I get involved with was there
to do.

1262
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:17,440
And it was really dispiriting.
It was all reactive.

1263
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:18,071
Everyone was like,
well,

1264
00:59:18,071 --> 00:59:20,920
we have to see what they do to decide
how to react.

1265
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:21,980
And I

1266
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,200
was like,
so you were just super upset that trump

1267
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:25,340
won?
Yeah,

1268
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:28,070
I could see what was about to happen.
And everything I was concerned about did

1269
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:29,720
happen.
But they basically all said,

1270
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,880
well,
you have to let him do his thing to then

1271
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:35,780
react and then have the population react
to what he did.

1272
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,270
And did you have any concerns at all
about hillary?

1273
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,690
Well,
I,

1274
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:40,880
I think,
uh,

1275
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,390
it reminded me a little bit of a,
I mean,

1276
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:51,650
I'm aware of what those issues are,
but I do think,

1277
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:55,250
you know,
there are large choices that just affect

1278
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,130
millions and hundreds of millions of
people.

1279
00:59:58,131 --> 01:00:01,160
Like for instance,
when a guy like Donald Trump says,

1280
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:05,240
we're not going to give money to any aid
service around the world that says

1281
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,550
anything about abortion,
forget giving out abortions.

1282
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:10,610
If they hand out a pamphlet and it says
that's an option,

1283
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,810
they don't get money.

1284
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:16,130
So if you're a country in Africa and
there's only one aids aid service,

1285
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:19,970
I like feeds starving people.
But you also hand out a pamphlet on

1286
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:21,680
abortion.
You don't get any of the money anymore.

1287
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:24,110
I agree.
That was fucked up and a lot of the

1288
01:00:24,111 --> 01:00:26,330
things he does are fucked up.
But did you have any problems at all

1289
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:29,000
with Hillary?
Like did you know I had a big issue that

1290
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:34,001
she does not seem to understand a
certain issues like the speech getting

1291
01:00:35,661 --> 01:00:39,710
paid for the speeches that,
that her blind spot and she has revealed

1292
01:00:39,711 --> 01:00:42,710
to still have it after the election that
like,

1293
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:43,970
uh,
why did I go there?

1294
01:00:43,971 --> 01:00:45,610
Cause I got paid,
uh,

1295
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:48,350
you know,
I guess they've made,

1296
01:00:48,351 --> 01:00:50,120
you know,
over a hundred million dollars giving

1297
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:53,510
speeches bill and Hillary Clinton,
which on one level you go,

1298
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,231
yeah,
you know,

1299
01:00:54,231 --> 01:00:57,250
people don't understand.
I'm going to go do a,

1300
01:00:57,251 --> 01:01:00,170
a standard corporate gig and it's crazy
money.

1301
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:04,250
There's a crazy corporate speech money
floating up.

1302
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,150
Yeah,
but wait a minute.

1303
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,453
No,
no,

1304
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,070
no,
no.

1305
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:11,630
I'm not defending it yet.
I'm just saying she has a blind spot to

1306
01:01:11,631 --> 01:01:14,540
what?
To the potential for corruption that

1307
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:18,170
people see in that and that she,
when you're,

1308
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,840
when you're getting,
I mean,

1309
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:24,110
well one article said it was like $150
billion between the two of them over

1310
01:01:24,111 --> 01:01:27,770
like 10 years or so.
The fact that she doesn't even have a

1311
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:30,410
good game to,
to defend it,

1312
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,800
that you can't go up against trump and
say he's corrupt while you're getting

1313
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:38,570
that much money from corporate
interests.

1314
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:41,750
Like she never even saw how offensive it
was.

1315
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:45,170
That kind of thing that Bernie Sanders
doesn't do.

1316
01:01:45,171 --> 01:01:45,831
So people go,
well,

1317
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:48,470
at least he's not lining his pockets
with that money.

1318
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:49,760
Hillary is basically saying,
I,

1319
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,940
I lined my pockets with that money,
but I still have my own opinions and the

1320
01:01:56,151 --> 01:02:00,620
blind spot at least to the outrage of it
is something that I,

1321
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:05,810
I had threw me.
But ultimately the main choices that she

1322
01:02:06,531 --> 01:02:10,880
wanted to make on a lot of issues are so
much more in line with what I believe

1323
01:02:10,881 --> 01:02:12,410
than trump.
That,

1324
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,470
although not a perfect candidate,
you know,

1325
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,650
trump is doing,
you know,

1326
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,170
he's,
he's trying to get this healthcare thing

1327
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:20,190
through and doesn't seem

1328
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:23,730
that concerned about the amount of
people are you get kicked off.

1329
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:26,820
So I,
I guess there are certain things I

1330
01:02:26,821 --> 01:02:29,250
sucked up about it.
I didn't have a core thing that she's

1331
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:32,000
like a terrible person,
but I think it,

1332
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,740
it's,
it's pretty hard to get me to that place

1333
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:37,920
with people.
I always need a little bit more proof of

1334
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,860
that.
But certainly she represents someone who

1335
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:43,050
is dishonest though.
And that's a real problem when you don't

1336
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:48,051
have a leader of this incredible country
and someone who's clearly dishonest and

1337
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:50,940
it's been dishonest for a long time.
Like when they talk to her about the

1338
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:52,950
emails,
every interview she gave about it,

1339
01:02:52,951 --> 01:02:55,980
she would give varying responses.
A lot of them were dishonest.

1340
01:02:55,981 --> 01:03:00,981
A lot of it was not based on facts when
she compared what she said Komi said to

1341
01:03:01,021 --> 01:03:04,260
her during the investigation versus what
Comi was saying publicly,

1342
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:05,460
they were totally different things.

1343
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:05,740
Oh,
I,

1344
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,060
I totally understand it.
I think that there's a lot of politics

1345
01:03:09,061 --> 01:03:13,500
that's really bad and really dirty and I
don't know enough on each specific thing

1346
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:14,730
that have a,
you know,

1347
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:19,731
a position on each thing that she said.
But I do feel like there are people who

1348
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:25,131
are playing the game with service in
mind and maybe they're getting dirty or

1349
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:29,190
making mistakes with service in mind.
And then there are people like trump

1350
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:31,440
that I really don't understand why he's
there.

1351
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:36,740
And His general philosophy is let the
smart rich people get richer and

1352
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:43,260
something nice might happen for you that
he's so dishonest on a level that you

1353
01:03:43,261 --> 01:03:45,630
can't compare it to.
It's just so,

1354
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,090
I mean he admits that he's a liar.
Uh,

1355
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,790
no,
I'm fully with you on this.

1356
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:54,791
But whenever people criticize trump or
whenever the people talk about Hillary

1357
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:57,930
rather the f one of the first things
they do is say trump is worse.

1358
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,750
They,
instead of like talking about how weird

1359
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:01,440
like,
oh,

1360
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,440
she's such an non ideal candidate.
Like she was such a terrible candidate.

1361
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:11,690
She didn't believe in gay marriage until
2013 you mean 2013 she was publicly

1362
01:04:12,061 --> 01:04:15,420
stating that gay marriage should be,
it should not be legal,

1363
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:17,790
that a marriage,
a legal marriage should be between a man

1364
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:19,800
and a woman.
And clearly for only political reasons,

1365
01:04:19,801 --> 01:04:22,080
like she obviously had exact issue with
it at all.

1366
01:04:22,081 --> 01:04:25,290
And I agree with you,
I feel like there is a part of politics

1367
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:26,940
where people,
you know,

1368
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:31,560
like say my position was evolving on
that one.

1369
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,330
No,
your position wasn't evolving.

1370
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:36,270
You just weren't fighting for what you
actually believe.

1371
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:39,780
Obama took a while to make big moves on
that.

1372
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:45,830
But I still think at core people like
that are trying to figure out the system

1373
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,160
to help people.
And I can't say I understand what trump

1374
01:04:50,161 --> 01:04:54,180
has in this for other than to be
considered the greatest winner of all

1375
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:54,961
time.
Yeah,

1376
01:04:54,961 --> 01:04:58,320
I think that's probably exactly it.
I don't think he really wanted to be

1377
01:04:58,321 --> 01:05:00,540
president.
I think he was doing it sort of boost

1378
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:04,950
his brand and along the way he lost the
television show right when he's doing

1379
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:06,330
all that,
build that wall shit.

1380
01:05:06,331 --> 01:05:09,120
And,
but running the wall just got 10 feet

1381
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:11,640
higher and NBC was like,
Fuck you man,

1382
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,980
we're canceling your show.
And when they did that,

1383
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:15,360
I think he was like,
Oh yeah,

1384
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:16,980
well I'm really going to be fucking
president.

1385
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:18,070
And he kept going

1386
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:21,550
and going and going and then he won.
I mean it seems to me like the whole

1387
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:24,340
thing was started almost as a publicity
campaign,

1388
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:27,550
like a fun thing.
What if his people said that there was a

1389
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:31,090
woman in publicity for him who left?
She's the only person I knew who left

1390
01:05:31,091 --> 01:05:33,340
the campaign for this reason,
I forgot her name,

1391
01:05:33,341 --> 01:05:36,110
but it was very public.
This wasn't a it.

1392
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:39,730
She said it publicly that when it
started,

1393
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:43,420
the plan was to come in second to help
the brand,

1394
01:05:43,421 --> 01:05:46,300
to get some fame,
to make some statements about what he

1395
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:50,680
believes with no belief that it was
possible that he would do better than

1396
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:54,910
second in the Republican primaries.
And then the woman said as it became

1397
01:05:54,911 --> 01:05:57,310
clear that they had a really good shot
of winning.

1398
01:05:57,311 --> 01:05:57,941
She said,
oh,

1399
01:05:57,941 --> 01:06:02,941
I wasn't in it for this.
And what I find fascinating to watch is

1400
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:08,370
trump's slowly getting comfortable with
power as as he thinks he's figuring it

1401
01:06:09,371 --> 01:06:11,350
out is interesting.

1402
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:12,483
Like,
uh,

1403
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:15,490
I mean even the Jerrod cushner thing is
kind of hilarious.

1404
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:19,060
You have this son in law,
so now you have a blind spot that anyone

1405
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:22,000
in the world thinks it's weird that you
give your son in law are real estate

1406
01:06:22,001 --> 01:06:25,810
developers so much power and he doesn't
care at all because he doesn't trust

1407
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:28,720
anybody except like four people.
So he's got to give them all the power,

1408
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:33,430
but he puts them in charge of fixing
everything wrong with the infrastructure

1409
01:06:33,431 --> 01:06:38,170
of governments and the Middle East and
two or three other things.

1410
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:42,460
And trump doesn't understand how insane
that appears.

1411
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:47,461
And also how each task is impossible.
Like this is my son when he's going to

1412
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:52,921
fix government and the Middle East,
the type of guy that doesn't realize,

1413
01:06:53,591 --> 01:06:57,520
well maybe there's one person for each
of those jobs is,

1414
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:58,570
that's where I just go,
oh,

1415
01:06:58,571 --> 01:07:00,850
he's full out crazy.

1416
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,820
Because who would even do that to their
son in law?

1417
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,520
Maybe his son in law is a pain in the
ass.

1418
01:07:06,521 --> 01:07:08,230
He's like,
this fucking kid thinks he could do

1419
01:07:08,231 --> 01:07:08,831
things.
All right,

1420
01:07:08,831 --> 01:07:11,800
I'll give you the worst job ever.
Go fix government.

1421
01:07:11,801 --> 01:07:13,510
Go fix the Middle East.
I got it.

1422
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:18,780
I'm going to prove my worth to you sir.
And Ray Ban Sunglasses and his preppy

1423
01:07:19,871 --> 01:07:21,500
outfit.
I mean it,

1424
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:25,890
it's become so comical.
You know,

1425
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:30,900
it's a fascinating thing because it's
both terrifying and comical.

1426
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:34,210
Like if this was a movie,
it's too broad and you wouldn't believe

1427
01:07:34,211 --> 01:07:36,400
it.
You would just go to much.

1428
01:07:36,401 --> 01:07:40,690
It's happening in every scene.
Too many crazy thoughts and what I

1429
01:07:40,691 --> 01:07:43,000
guess,
I guess what I wonder,

1430
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:45,100
I mean maybe you have an opinion about
this.

1431
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:46,480
There are people who say,
you know,

1432
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:50,890
it is the destruction of truth when you
just make these lies up all day long,

1433
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:56,310
that you changed the definition of truth
or even people's ability to decide what

1434
01:07:56,831 --> 01:08:01,831
they think is the truth.
Is that a philosophy that someone like

1435
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:07,291
bannon is executing in the White House
or something that happens randomly and,

1436
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:10,630
and,
and is organic out of them?

1437
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:13,420
That's a real good question.
I mean,

1438
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:16,730
there's always the concept.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

1439
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:20,030
And knowing that you're in some sort of
a competition,

1440
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,430
knowing that you are,
uh,

1441
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:27,890
there's people trying to knock you down
and you're in this position of power and

1442
01:08:27,891 --> 01:08:31,550
you're shoring up your defenses.
And I think there's a lot of weird stuff

1443
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:35,600
that goes on whenever you're the winning
team and you realize you're being

1444
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:38,300
attacked at all angles by this other
team.

1445
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,550
And then you've got this guy who's the
head guys,

1446
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,130
a fucking maniac.
He's got fake hair.

1447
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:47,540
He puts a spray Tan on every day.
He's out there as his eyes are white.

1448
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,940
No one tells him his face,
his orange.

1449
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:53,900
He's saying insane shit.
He contradicts himself all the time.

1450
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:58,700
He lies all the time about numbers.
He's always bragging about how well his

1451
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:03,380
ratings are and how shows do really well
because everybody knows he watches the

1452
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:05,690
show.
It's crazy stuff that you just don't

1453
01:09:05,691 --> 01:09:09,950
expect from someone who's in the
position of president of the United

1454
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:10,100
States.

1455
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,260
I think almost all bets are off at this
point.

1456
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,720
That's the one thing that I find
promising about this,

1457
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,050
that people are so upset by how fucked
up this it is.

1458
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:20,870
This is that they're going to get
politically active and that they're

1459
01:09:20,871 --> 01:09:23,120
going to realize like there's some real
holes in the system,

1460
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:26,420
like the FBI,
like the president shouldn't just be

1461
01:09:26,421 --> 01:09:30,590
able to fire the head of the FBI because
you don't like the investigation like of

1462
01:09:30,591 --> 01:09:32,740
yourself sane and,
and,

1463
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:36,320
and sessions recused himself,
but he can fire the guy investigating

1464
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:37,430
himself.
Insane.

1465
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:38,840
It's all insane.
But I,

1466
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:43,841
I guess what my fear would be is that
when it just swings back the other way,

1467
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:47,960
like you could just swing left,
right,

1468
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,730
right,
right.

1469
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:53,730
But are any institutional protections
that were put in place because it just

1470
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:57,500
swings back up.
But like for instance say like we don't,

1471
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,390
you know,
I'm not an expert in healthcare,

1472
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:03,380
but let's assume it's just a shit storm.

1473
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:04,191
Right?
And in,

1474
01:10:04,191 --> 01:10:08,240
in a year or two,
whatever millions of people are losing

1475
01:10:08,241 --> 01:10:10,310
the healthcare and everyday you're just
hanging about hundreds of people who

1476
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:11,960
have cancer who can't pay for their
medicine.

1477
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:17,000
What happens in this country?
Do People get mad at the Republicans?

1478
01:10:17,001 --> 01:10:20,600
Did they vote them out or to somehow not
enough sick people?

1479
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,840
There's not enough sick people to make
the change.

1480
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,590
I think there's so many issues.
There's so many issues that like where

1481
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:29,510
do you draw the line?
Do you draw the line at them?

1482
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:32,300
Taking the teeth out of the EPA,
which is what they're done.

1483
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,610
Environmental Protection Agency is
fucked now.

1484
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:37,520
I mean they were moving the satellites
that track global warming,

1485
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,271
they're,
they're,

1486
01:10:38,271 --> 01:10:40,760
they're,
they're stopping funding for all these

1487
01:10:40,761 --> 01:10:43,520
different initiatives and all these
different programs and all these

1488
01:10:43,521 --> 01:10:46,880
different studies.
They're trying to figure out what the

1489
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:48,380
fuck is going on at the plant.
They were like that,

1490
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:52,770
that the stop all that.
What we really need is Enron and Exxon,

1491
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:55,400
all these different companies,
big conglomerates,

1492
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:57,140
big corporations.
We need to drill,

1493
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,210
we need to drill,
we need to frack,

1494
01:10:59,211 --> 01:11:00,800
we need to go over where,
you know,

1495
01:11:00,801 --> 01:11:04,010
Alaska and we're in the Antarctic.
We get in that ground,

1496
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:06,380
pull that oil out and,
and it's,

1497
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,310
it's,
that's,

1498
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:09,740
that's scary.
And then you hear the healthcare shit.

1499
01:11:09,741 --> 01:11:11,240
Well,
well that's scary too.

1500
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:14,130
And then you hear the Russian shit.
Well that's scary.

1501
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,030
North Korea.
Oh,

1502
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:17,670
that's scary.
There's so many different things to be

1503
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:21,270
scared about.
I don't think the people who don't have

1504
01:11:21,271 --> 01:11:24,930
cancer don't have diseases are really
considering all this healthcare stuff.

1505
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,610
I think it's one of those things that
happens.

1506
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:30,750
Once you have a health issue,
then you realize how fuck the system is

1507
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,970
and especially if you don't have the
money to take care of it,

1508
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,080
you're like,
wow,

1509
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,050
like our medical system in this country
is not,

1510
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:39,540
it's not the best.
We have the best doctors.

1511
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:43,350
We certainly have the best surgeons and
we have some pretty amazing innovative

1512
01:11:43,351 --> 01:11:45,550
medicine.
But when it comes to like the,

1513
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:49,440
the system itself for like when you find
out how much people have to pay when

1514
01:11:49,441 --> 01:11:51,240
they go to the doctor and how about you
eve,

1515
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:53,820
you have insurance but the insurance
only covers so much.

1516
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:54,900
You still have to pay more.

1517
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:55,251
Sure.
By,

1518
01:11:55,251 --> 01:11:59,490
by my mom died of ovarian cancer.
And I just remember going through those

1519
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:03,900
bills and there was a lot of
experimental medicine that potentially

1520
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:07,170
could save her.
And you didn't know if insurance would

1521
01:12:07,171 --> 01:12:12,171
say this is the type of approach that
they are willing to pay for.

1522
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,870
Right.
And anything you needed to do,

1523
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:20,820
you'd have to prove you needed it.
Someone says you needed a new cat scan

1524
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:25,800
and you've had to that ear,
you might have to go to a war to say why

1525
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:26,910
you need it now.
Right.

1526
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,370
And uh,
I remember crunchers,

1527
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:32,460
I'm just always fascinated that it
doesn't line up for people.

1528
01:12:32,461 --> 01:12:34,500
Like you say you love the outdoors and
you love hunting.

1529
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:36,330
Well don't you love the environment,
right?

1530
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:41,490
And so why are you not really pissed or
trumps going to build a wall and he's

1531
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:44,490
going to take a lot of people's land
away to build the wall?

1532
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,080
Well,
I thought that was the big issue for all

1533
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:48,090
of these militia groups don't mess with
our land.

1534
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:50,150
Yeah.
And so there's always going to do is

1535
01:12:50,151 --> 01:12:51,840
going to take land away to build the
wall.

1536
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:55,050
The only way to build the wall in a lot
of those plots of land,

1537
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,330
a lot of private lands.
I mean it's a,

1538
01:12:57,331 --> 01:13:00,900
it's a,
that's a jagged path when you're

1539
01:13:00,901 --> 01:13:03,170
building that wall and you have to,
you know,

1540
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:06,870
you have to take away a lot of people's
lands to pull that off.

1541
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:09,870
Uh,
so that's what scares me the most about

1542
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:14,750
America's.
There's an ilogic to people's opinions.

1543
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:17,340
I think there's too many variables.
I think there's too many things to,

1544
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:19,890
for people to consider.
And I think people work all day and then

1545
01:13:19,891 --> 01:13:22,830
they have hobbies and families and
things they enjoy doing and they don't

1546
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,450
have the time to really sit.

1547
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:28,980
I mean each one of those issues would
require a full time job all day long

1548
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,750
investigating,
exacerbating it,

1549
01:13:30,751 --> 01:13:34,290
discussing it,
whether it's Flynn's ties to Russia or

1550
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:38,540
what session knows and how many times
did he speak to the Russians or what

1551
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:40,620
did,
what did jared cushner actually do in

1552
01:13:40,621 --> 01:13:42,710
the Middle East?
Like what is he doing in the overlap?

1553
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,030
Cause each one of those is a full time
job.

1554
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:48,150
What does he sing to Netanyahu alone in
the room.

1555
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:51,630
How do they let him do that?
He looks like such a Dork.

1556
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,960
Did you see the pictures of him with a
bulletproof vest on overseas?

1557
01:13:54,961 --> 01:13:57,810
And he's hanging around with the actual
soldiers and he's sitting there with his

1558
01:13:57,811 --> 01:14:02,370
ray bans on masking tape with his name
magic markered on it.

1559
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,760
And it's,
it's a comedy.

1560
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:10,000
And I have to say as a creative person
who's going to be at the Wilbur Oh,

1561
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:10,861
uh,
when,

1562
01:14:10,861 --> 01:14:12,580
when he to go,
what am I get the Wilbur,

1563
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:13,870
this is called the mid show.

1564
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:15,580
A plug.
Everybody,

1565
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,410
uh,
the Wilburn Boston,

1566
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,990
uh,
just added a late show for charity for

1567
01:14:19,991 --> 01:14:22,000
the afterschool programs for Boston
Arts,

1568
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,640
July 24th,
the wilbur.com.

1569
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:27,790
One of my favorite theaters in the
warpath and the best crowds.

1570
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:28,930
Amazing.
It's incredible.

1571
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:31,680
And it feels like you're in a club.
There's a thousand people in there,

1572
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:34,150
but they're all in three tiers.
Yeah.

1573
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:36,640
And so it's very short.
It's like three,

1574
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:39,670
300 seat comedy clubs jammed in there
together.

1575
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,400
It's the perfect layout for common.
It really is.

1576
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:45,760
And then I'll be in a providence,
Rhode Island at the Columbus Theater.

1577
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:48,940
Uh,
July 25th and at the Richfield playhouse

1578
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:49,990
in Ridgefield,
Connecticut.

1579
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:53,940
July 23rd and I'm taping my special Ed
Montreal,

1580
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,570
the just for laughs festival because
they seem to be amused by me then.

1581
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:59,410
Oh,
that's an amazing place to do it at the

1582
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,690
festival and the festival.
Yeah.

1583
01:15:00,691 --> 01:15:03,040
How many shows are you going to do?
I'm doing five shows.

1584
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,240
I'm taping four of them.
Oh,

1585
01:15:04,241 --> 01:15:05,860
that's a good move.
I like that.

1586
01:15:05,861 --> 01:15:08,280
I like when I hear that.
I hate when I hear someone taping one

1587
01:15:08,281 --> 01:15:08,861
show.
No,

1588
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:09,131
no.
I,

1589
01:15:09,131 --> 01:15:11,700
I could panic and ruin one show.
I can,

1590
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:13,540
I can actually,
if I did only two shifts,

1591
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:16,870
I can panic the first show and then go,
okay,

1592
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,390
now I only have one show to get it and
panic again.

1593
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,160
Who are you doing your special for?
Uh,

1594
01:15:21,161 --> 01:15:22,840
for Netflix.
Oh yeah.

1595
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:24,730
That's the way to go.
It was my turn.

1596
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:26,380
Nice.
And so

1597
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,920
I haven't done something like that
since.

1598
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:34,330
Basically the HBO Young Comedian Special
in 1992 with the Ray Romano,

1599
01:15:34,331 --> 01:15:36,670
the guy who got fired.
So you could have your career.

1600
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:37,533
No,
I didn't.

1601
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:40,090
He got fired.
So somebody else could take it.

1602
01:15:40,091 --> 01:15:42,370
And then that guy fired and I got two
kids.

1603
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:43,810
I don't know who is the in between.

1604
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:46,060
Guy was on the pilot,
there was a guy on the pilot that was

1605
01:15:46,061 --> 01:15:50,710
not ray ray got fired and another guy
took his spot and then that guy fired

1606
01:15:50,711 --> 01:15:53,530
and I took that guy spot.
I'll Paul Simms is vicious.

1607
01:15:53,531 --> 01:15:56,050
Vicious.
He was going to get it done right around

1608
01:15:56,150 --> 01:16:01,150
a little bit of in the news radio days
just as a friend of Paul's and Andy

1609
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:04,300
Dicks.
And that show is a show that holds up

1610
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:07,180
and is really funny.
Well I was just happy that there was a

1611
01:16:07,181 --> 01:16:09,550
buffer between me and rang cause I love
Ray.

1612
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:12,070
I would not have wanted to be the guy
that takes Ray's job.

1613
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:16,330
I think ray is one of the first people
to tell you he probably was not prepared

1614
01:16:16,331 --> 01:16:19,890
as an actor at that exact moment.
What was the wrong gig forum?

1615
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,840
Everybody loves Raymond was the perfect
gay.

1616
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:25,420
Yes.
Let him write for himself and let him

1617
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:28,000
figure it all out and become obsessed
with it.

1618
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,360
He's such a good guy.
Oh,

1619
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:32,470
he's the best.
Ray Romano was like one of the nicest

1620
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:34,690
people I've ever met.
And so good in our movie.

1621
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:36,070
The big sick.
Honestly,

1622
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,650
the dream part.
So funny.

1623
01:16:38,651 --> 01:16:40,090
So real,
very,

1624
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:44,770
I mean it's the culmination of
everything he's learned as an actor and

1625
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:46,780
a,
and a and a person.

1626
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,560
Uh,
so I'm very excited about that.

1627
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:53,470
Just doing that tbs things doing like a
drama for awhile yet men of a certain

1628
01:16:53,471 --> 01:16:56,200
age depress dudes.
That's what I called it,

1629
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:59,350
a bunch of depressed dudes.
I called it the Judd apatow story

1630
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:02,590
and yeah,
he's,

1631
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,640
he's so,
he's so good.

1632
01:17:03,641 --> 01:17:05,910
He was on parenthood for awhile.
Um,

1633
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:08,890
and I've gotten to spend a little time
with him because of this movie,

1634
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:12,230
but it is funny that we were on the
young comedian special in 1992.

1635
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:15,440
That is amazing.
And now you're back at it and now and

1636
01:17:15,441 --> 01:17:16,700
now I'm back doing it again.

1637
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:20,460
You've done stand up now for three years
since yeah.

1638
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:22,550
Since uh,
2000 for three years straight.

1639
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,840
Yeah.
And then like what,

1640
01:17:23,841 --> 01:17:26,810
like how many years in where you like,
I think I've got a special here.

1641
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:29,480
They asked me to do it a year ago and I
said,

1642
01:17:29,481 --> 01:17:31,010
okay,
give me one more year.

1643
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,520
So that's very honest of you.
Well,

1644
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:36,080
you know,
everybody's so good.

1645
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:39,200
I mean,
I was performing the other night and the

1646
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:44,201
original room and you were in the main
room and I could hear the place rocking

1647
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:50,080
from the stage of the original room.
Maybe bike ride was too quiet that I

1648
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:53,720
could hear you.
I could hear your last and you just,

1649
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:55,710
you know,
talking loud and I,

1650
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,230
and so I always think,
wow,

1651
01:17:57,231 --> 01:17:59,390
people are so good right now.
People,

1652
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:04,690
people are masters at this and I can't
be mediocre at it.

1653
01:18:05,631 --> 01:18:07,970
I mean,
I'm in the same business as you and

1654
01:18:07,971 --> 01:18:12,971
Maria Bamford and Louis Ck and Hannibal
and I have to be able to be proud of

1655
01:18:13,251 --> 01:18:13,790
what I'm doing.

1656
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:18,710
So Joey Diaz and bill bird,
this is a different time or so many

1657
01:18:18,711 --> 01:18:20,810
murderers out there right now.
Yeah,

1658
01:18:20,811 --> 01:18:23,930
I mean I was watching Burr,
I did a largo show that he was on and I

1659
01:18:23,931 --> 01:18:27,230
was just watching him from the side of
the stage and just his level of

1660
01:18:27,231 --> 01:18:29,690
intensity is so,
you know,

1661
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:33,440
in a weird way it's so professional and
I notice it with you the other night too

1662
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:37,580
that you could get yourself in that
state where you care so much and you're

1663
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:42,581
so passionate and it requires so much
energy and focus to get to that place,

1664
01:18:43,611 --> 01:18:48,080
to perform with that passion.
It's just really impressive cause like

1665
01:18:48,081 --> 01:18:50,350
for me I can just get tired and starts
tearing a night.

1666
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,610
How did it get tired?
Halfway through like,

1667
01:18:52,611 --> 01:18:56,270
oh like it's just felt a wave of like,
like after you eat a big meal and you

1668
01:18:56,271 --> 01:18:59,180
just get tired,
like it just hit you eight minutes.

1669
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:03,140
What I'm always trying to accomplish is
trying to get out whatever I'm trying to

1670
01:19:03,141 --> 01:19:06,230
talk about with the most power that I
can like the most.

1671
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:08,660
Like what's the best way to do it is the
best way to do it.

1672
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:13,690
Slow and calm and let people soak in the
idea or is the best way to do it to be

1673
01:19:14,781 --> 01:19:19,580
intense and like what is like the most
entertaining way that I would be

1674
01:19:19,581 --> 01:19:23,300
engaging this material,
figure whatever that is and and fuck

1675
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:26,490
with it and moving around and bring it
up and bring it down.

1676
01:19:26,491 --> 01:19:29,810
And that's one of the things where the
store is such a great place to focus on

1677
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,440
that kind of stuff because there's so
many killers because of the standards

1678
01:19:33,441 --> 01:19:37,790
are so high that you have to really,
you really have to be on point and it's

1679
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:41,930
packed every night you go to the comedy.
So the main room would use it as be

1680
01:19:41,931 --> 01:19:46,760
desolate like four years ago.
It's sold out like it's vegas every

1681
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,960
night.
Every night I walk in there like I got

1682
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:48,950
some new jokes.
I'm like,

1683
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:51,980
can I do,
how many new jokes can I do when this is

1684
01:19:51,981 --> 01:19:56,981
a big sold out excited crowd,
which changed the face of comedy in La.

1685
01:19:57,261 --> 01:19:59,570
Now,
I mean comedy in La is a different thing

1686
01:19:59,571 --> 01:20:01,130
now.
The last few years.

1687
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:05,210
It's also funny how a place like the
comedy store,

1688
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:07,220
you know our friend Adam,
uh,

1689
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:07,980
he got

1690
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,450
who who books it.
Just one guy with good tastes booking

1691
01:20:12,451 --> 01:20:16,320
the club well and suddenly everyone in
town wants to run to that club.

1692
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:18,660
Again,
both comedians and the audience because

1693
01:20:18,661 --> 01:20:23,370
Adam does such a good job looking at
opening up that back bar where you gave

1694
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:26,250
us a place where the public can't go on
a comics can go and hang out.

1695
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,400
That was giant where there was a place
to chill and hang out.

1696
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,360
People with like you'd be sitting there
with Ron Wyden,

1697
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:34,170
allow,
I'm on in five c your boys and he'd go

1698
01:20:34,171 --> 01:20:36,630
out there and do a set.
Then Diaz would come back and all these

1699
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:37,980
different people are hanging out there.
You're like,

1700
01:20:37,981 --> 01:20:40,560
wow,
like this place is like something

1701
01:20:40,561 --> 01:20:41,261
special.
Like they,

1702
01:20:41,261 --> 01:20:43,410
they made changes,
they figured things out,

1703
01:20:43,411 --> 01:20:44,580
they did things differently.
Yeah.

1704
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,510
I missed just hanging out with comics
when I wasn't doing stand up.

1705
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:52,170
I was like,
I don't know anybody anymore.

1706
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:54,870
Like,
I literally don't know anybody that just

1707
01:20:54,871 --> 01:20:58,380
the idea of being a part of that
community and it is a community of

1708
01:20:58,381 --> 01:21:00,720
people that are really smart,
you know,

1709
01:21:00,721 --> 01:21:02,250
really,
really funny.

1710
01:21:02,251 --> 01:21:07,200
And I think generally incredibly
supportive community to each other.

1711
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:08,370
Yes.
Yeah.

1712
01:21:08,371 --> 01:21:12,510
Well I think especially now there's so
many opportunities I don't think people

1713
01:21:12,511 --> 01:21:16,320
feel like is starved.
I think there was a famine mentality

1714
01:21:16,321 --> 01:21:19,620
that was going on way back in the day
when it was everybody competing for

1715
01:21:19,621 --> 01:21:23,660
tonight show spots and then every now
and then someone got an hbo special and

1716
01:21:23,661 --> 01:21:26,220
it was Holy Shit there was not that many
hbo specials.

1717
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:31,290
But other than that you had to do talk
shows and you had to do like a few

1718
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:34,440
minutes on a talk show or you know,
maybe you were like a Richard Jenny who

1719
01:21:34,441 --> 01:21:38,280
thrived in that format and you could do
30 tonight show things and then fill up

1720
01:21:38,281 --> 01:21:39,420
arenas because of that.

1721
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:44,490
But for most people it was a scratch and
claw environment and people were

1722
01:21:44,491 --> 01:21:48,600
fighting to try to get a sitcom and
fighting to try to get movie roles and

1723
01:21:48,601 --> 01:21:50,280
all these,
there was not a lot.

1724
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:53,280
But now because of the Internet,
because of Youtube,

1725
01:21:53,281 --> 01:21:56,280
because of social media and then a
Netflix,

1726
01:21:56,281 --> 01:21:59,260
which was giant,
there's so much opportunity like,

1727
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:03,060
and the comedians have also found way
more of an audience.

1728
01:22:03,061 --> 01:22:05,790
There's way more audience out there
because people realize like,

1729
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:07,770
Oh look,
Sarah Silverman has a new netflix

1730
01:22:07,771 --> 01:22:08,461
special.
Oh look,

1731
01:22:08,461 --> 01:22:11,450
Jim Jefferies has a new netflix special.
I'll look bill burroughs and who?

1732
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,530
Netflix special.
And just keeps going and going and going

1733
01:22:13,531 --> 01:22:14,490
and going and going.
It's like,

1734
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:17,220
it's almost unstoppable.
And I remember when I was a kid,

1735
01:22:17,221 --> 01:22:19,140
there was nothing.
It was just like Robert Klein would have

1736
01:22:19,141 --> 01:22:22,350
a special every couple of years now.
And then George Carlin every couple of

1737
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:23,910
years,
they didn't give the hours too many

1738
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:24,630
people.

1739
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:28,110
And there were so many people that
probably could have done a netflix

1740
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:29,370
special back then.
Sure.

1741
01:22:29,371 --> 01:22:31,350
And they didn't have the audience.
They never got the shot.

1742
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:32,430
And,
you know,

1743
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:36,210
they just sort of stayed at a certain
state in their career forever.

1744
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:37,230
Yeah.
You know,

1745
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:38,880
it's just,
this is an amazing,

1746
01:22:38,881 --> 01:22:40,890
amazing time for it.
Yeah.

1747
01:22:40,891 --> 01:22:41,730
And it's good.
I mean,

1748
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:42,600
I watch people,
I'm like,

1749
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:43,630
God damn,
that's,

1750
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:47,080
people are fucking great.
I mean,

1751
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,560
I'd really like watch people.
I was watching Ray Romano the other

1752
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,390
night,
his act was just monstrous.

1753
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:52,980
Yeah.
He was so strong.

1754
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,720
Have you seen the Andrew Santina at the
store?

1755
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:55,860
Oh yeah.
Fine.

1756
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:57,900
Let's go.
I'm going to end up here.

1757
01:22:58,640 --> 01:22:59,580
I mean,
it's so good.

1758
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,810
I,
it's uh,

1759
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:02,820
it's exciting.
I can't think about it too much because

1760
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:05,170
sometimes I think there's so many people
why do it?

1761
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:05,980
But I'm trying to

1762
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,190
make it very much about the audience and
me and that,

1763
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:13,600
you know,
because I make movies and do tv that my

1764
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:18,310
standup career really is just about
getting to hang out with everybody and

1765
01:23:18,311 --> 01:23:21,130
my relationship with that particular
crowd that night.

1766
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:24,760
Like I don't need it to pay the rent,
so I could do it from a very pure place

1767
01:23:24,761 --> 01:23:28,270
cause it's just about these
interactions.

1768
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,290
That's great.
You know?

1769
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:31,780
And so,
and it frees me up to not be nervous and

1770
01:23:31,781 --> 01:23:35,350
then I can be a little more daring
because it's not going to going to sink

1771
01:23:35,351 --> 01:23:38,800
me if anything goes wrong.
Do you think that it enhances your

1772
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:41,210
ability to make movies?
Does it enhance your perspective?

1773
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:42,790
Oh yeah.
It's a funny,

1774
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:46,120
I think that when you don't talk
directly to the crowd,

1775
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:50,770
you get stale as to what people are
thinking about.

1776
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:52,360
You know,
I can tell,

1777
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,240
I don't know,
just when I bring up certain topics,

1778
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:59,560
just what people's concerns are and it
happens unconsciously.

1779
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:01,960
Oh,
this is what people find funny these

1780
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,910
days.
This is what people are freaking out

1781
01:24:03,911 --> 01:24:05,650
about.
This is what people are happy about.

1782
01:24:05,651 --> 01:24:07,810
And when you don't do it,
you're just alone in a room with your

1783
01:24:07,811 --> 01:24:09,720
editor.
You're just sitting in it with you

1784
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,200
sitting with one dude for two years.
And I think,

1785
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:18,280
uh,
I also think you're connecting to some,

1786
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:19,001
you know,
whatever,

1787
01:24:19,001 --> 01:24:19,250
your,
your,

1788
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,610
your,
the creativity of the universe because

1789
01:24:21,611 --> 01:24:25,870
you're in spaces with a lot of people,
with a lot of other creative people and

1790
01:24:25,871 --> 01:24:29,230
you're hooking into creativity on some
level.

1791
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:32,620
I've always wondered how comedy writers
who don't do standup can do it.

1792
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:34,840
I've always wondered like,
how do they know?

1793
01:24:34,841 --> 01:24:37,270
It's funny like how do they know what's
what they're guessing?

1794
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,650
Well,
it's weird to write jokes,

1795
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:41,200
make a movie,
and then two years later find out if

1796
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:42,750
they're funny.
That's our,

1797
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:43,690
that's why people say,
Oh,

1798
01:24:43,691 --> 01:24:44,710
why do you have so much improv?

1799
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:46,390
Because I don't want to be in an editing
room.

1800
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:50,230
Put in the joke.
I wrote realize it sucks and then go,

1801
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:53,470
do we have any other jokes?
And the editor Says No.

1802
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:56,620
Ooh.
So I always want like I it with any

1803
01:24:56,621 --> 01:24:57,490
scene,
I always go,

1804
01:24:57,491 --> 01:24:59,110
well that's where the joke supposed to
be.

1805
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:02,480
Here's my favorite,
let's get eight more and low and then

1806
01:25:02,481 --> 01:25:05,770
we'll move on.
I never think like when there's people

1807
01:25:05,771 --> 01:25:08,740
like the Coen brothers and it's
verbatim,

1808
01:25:08,741 --> 01:25:10,650
you can't change a comma when they shoot
it.

1809
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,100
Is that what is good?
What is with them?

1810
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:17,370
It's like a play and I respect it,
but I do not have the courage to assume

1811
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:22,540
when I hit editing that I am such a
genius that I will not have fucked up

1812
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:25,720
any of this in the writing.
They have a weird kind of comedy though.

1813
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:28,660
They're comedy is so quirky and
fascinating,

1814
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,190
like,
and I guess maybe it's just that,

1815
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,100
that purity of vision that they have.

1816
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,720
Sure.
And sticking to that script.

1817
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:36,400
And a lot of people do that.
I mean,

1818
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:37,070
uh,
no,

1819
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:39,850
a bomb back does that and you know,
you can't change any of it.

1820
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:43,090
But I always think,
I don't know if,

1821
01:25:43,091 --> 01:25:45,280
uh,
if an actor's a said Ray Romano was on

1822
01:25:45,281 --> 01:25:48,520
the set of the big sick and he's talking
about his feelings and he has the scene,

1823
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:49,990
if I go,
uh,

1824
01:25:49,991 --> 01:25:51,100
you know,
uh,

1825
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:52,560
you know,
Michael Showalter,

1826
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:53,650
director of that movie,
Hey,

1827
01:25:53,651 --> 01:25:54,760
let,
let them do another one.

1828
01:25:54,761 --> 01:25:57,880
Let's just let him change it this,
but tell him to hit the same idea.

1829
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:01,660
Right.
Half the time he beats the joke at the

1830
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:02,494
time.
Yeah.

1831
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,980
If you have the right cast,
well

1832
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,870
that was what sims did on Newsradio.
He led everybody just come up with

1833
01:26:08,871 --> 01:26:12,230
better lines.
It was a big part of why the show works

1834
01:26:12,231 --> 01:26:15,290
so well.
It's like we all felt really invested in

1835
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:18,740
the creative process and that's so rare
and that's,

1836
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:21,840
I remember it was shandling would do
that on a [inaudible] should.

1837
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:25,700
They would rehearse for several days and
in that rehearsal people were allowed to

1838
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:27,890
screw around and if something good came
up,

1839
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:31,850
Gary would would write it down.
And Hartman was the funniest.

1840
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:34,550
Phil Hartman really was,
you know,

1841
01:26:34,551 --> 01:26:38,000
when you really make the list of the
funniest people of all time,

1842
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:41,570
he's just so high up on that list.
It was a remarkable thing.

1843
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:45,440
I would go to tapings of that show and
SNL tapings and at one point I was

1844
01:26:45,441 --> 01:26:49,820
talking about writing an Hbo special
with him and I don't know if there's

1845
01:26:49,821 --> 01:26:53,810
ever been anyone more challenge in more
ways than him now.

1846
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:55,040
He was brilliant.
He did.

1847
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:59,000
He really was incredibly disciplined to
why when I was on the set with them,

1848
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:03,950
he was becoming a pilot and so he was a,
in the middle of scenes he would be

1849
01:27:03,951 --> 01:27:07,670
reading flight books and reading books
on aviation and,

1850
01:27:07,671 --> 01:27:10,190
and writing notes and taking notes.
His,

1851
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:14,810
he was so organized like his scripts,
he would put them all in a binder,

1852
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:17,120
he would take the script immediately.
You put three punch,

1853
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:21,890
put it in a binder and he would have
tabs for each of his scenes and each tab

1854
01:27:21,891 --> 01:27:23,760
had a different color.
This is scene one,

1855
01:27:23,761 --> 01:27:25,610
scene two.
And he would have everything set up like

1856
01:27:25,611 --> 01:27:29,750
that and have this line's highlighted
and he would practice them and have them

1857
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:32,030
down to like a razor sharp.
Yeah,

1858
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,150
it was amazing.
He was a really,

1859
01:27:35,151 --> 01:27:36,650
really,
really interesting guy.

1860
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,840
A very unique,
I don't think I've ever met anybody like

1861
01:27:38,841 --> 01:27:41,930
him because he also came out of,
uh,

1862
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:44,380
he was a designer and scientist.

1863
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:46,670
Yeah.
Did album covers and stuff.

1864
01:27:46,671 --> 01:27:48,380
And,
and he said that he got Saturday night

1865
01:27:48,381 --> 01:27:53,381
live because he went in for the audition
and he was retiring because his career

1866
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:55,370
hadn't worked out the way he wanted it
to.

1867
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:57,260
And then someone said,
do you want to go in for snl?

1868
01:27:57,261 --> 01:28:01,460
And he was so ready to be done that he
had an amazing audition cause he assumed

1869
01:28:01,461 --> 01:28:03,350
he wouldn't get it.
And basically it was like,

1870
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,740
fuck this business.
And then that's the moment when he was

1871
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:08,570
in his purest funny itself and just got
it.

1872
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:10,790
Oh,
interesting guy,

1873
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:14,480
man.
He was blackmailed while we were on the

1874
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:17,180
show.
And a while we're on the show,

1875
01:28:17,181 --> 01:28:22,181
he and his wife actually had went to a
strip club and this was like 1997,

1876
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:27,500
97,
98,

1877
01:28:27,501 --> 01:28:28,970
somewhere around there.
So,

1878
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:31,790
uh,
this some asshole at a strip club,

1879
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:35,930
got a video camera,
brought in a video camera and filmed

1880
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:41,020
like a fucking video camera back then.
And he filmed phil and his wife at a

1881
01:28:42,021 --> 01:28:44,510
strip club laughing,
just having a couple of drinks.

1882
01:28:44,511 --> 01:28:48,890
And I think phil got a lap dance and his
wife got a lap dance and then they laugh

1883
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,800
and he this guy,
um,

1884
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:56,380
put a copy of this video tape in an
envelope and nailed it to Phil's garage

1885
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:58,580
door.
Oh fuck.

1886
01:28:58,610 --> 01:29:00,920
With a note saying,
cause I had Herman's thing.

1887
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:02,070
It was scary shit.
Yeah,

1888
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,590
but it was different because Letterman,
his thing was someone he knew.

1889
01:29:04,591 --> 01:29:07,830
And this was not a guy I knew and this
is the guy who found out where Phil

1890
01:29:07,831 --> 01:29:11,430
lived and said,
I'm going to get this to uh,

1891
01:29:11,431 --> 01:29:14,940
all of the advertisers that you know,
you do commercials with and all the

1892
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:17,880
people that you do films with and I'm
going to ruin your career unless you

1893
01:29:17,881 --> 01:29:20,220
give me money.
Call me at this number that I left his

1894
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:23,520
fucking number.
So Phil calls the Guy Records the thing

1895
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:25,780
and we did it in the room with me and he
goes,

1896
01:29:25,781 --> 01:29:28,250
I'm going to call the guy now.
I'm gonna call the guy now we shut.

1897
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:30,510
And he goes,
hey buddy,

1898
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,250
what's going on?
Listen,

1899
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:35,760
I understand what you're saying,
but you got to realize like,

1900
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:39,030
I don't have as much money as you think
I do.

1901
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:40,380
And I mean this is coming.

1902
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:43,890
I don't want the tape getting out.
But I mean you're making it out like

1903
01:29:43,891 --> 01:29:46,290
it's a bigger deal than it is.
And the guy was like,

1904
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:46,790
look,
I'm,

1905
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:48,390
I'm telling you and this that,
and the guy was like,

1906
01:29:48,391 --> 01:29:50,430
look,
I'm willing to work with you.

1907
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:53,340
Let's just come to a reasonable
reasonable number.

1908
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:56,220
So they come to this reasonable number
in this whole time where he's doing

1909
01:29:56,221 --> 01:29:58,320
this,
he's recording this and he gets it to

1910
01:29:58,321 --> 01:30:02,280
this private investigator guy and then
this asshole meets the private

1911
01:30:02,281 --> 01:30:04,860
investigator thinking he's going to meet
Phil and get paid.

1912
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:08,590
And this private investigator guy scares
that fucking shit out of him and

1913
01:30:08,591 --> 01:30:11,790
threatens his life and you know,
takes his wallet from him,

1914
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:13,430
takes photos of his,
you know,

1915
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,830
his address and you know,
basically says,

1916
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:22,070
don't ever contact him again or your
life will radically change in a horrible

1917
01:30:22,411 --> 01:30:22,980
way.

1918
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:25,950
And the guy disappeared.
But it was weird to be in the room with

1919
01:30:25,951 --> 01:30:27,930
them and feels like close to dark too.
I'm going to call him.

1920
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:31,650
I was like wiping his hands.
Sounds like an Anthony Pelicano special.

1921
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:33,690
Uh,
exactly what we're talking about.

1922
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:36,300
Yeah,
that's exactly what we're talking about.

1923
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:38,210
That's a,
that's a ray Donovan Shit.

1924
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:39,690
Yeah,
it's Ray Donovan Shit.

1925
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,030
It was weird.
It was weird to be there for that to see

1926
01:30:42,031 --> 01:30:46,620
like it is also to see like that someone
would like try to weasel in on them.

1927
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:50,730
Phil was just such a nice guy.
Just he knew this dude that was like a

1928
01:30:50,731 --> 01:30:52,650
carpenter.
The guy did some work with them.

1929
01:30:52,651 --> 01:30:56,460
The guy called him out of this halt,
call them horrible sob story.

1930
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:58,740
You know,
we're going to lose our house and this

1931
01:30:58,741 --> 01:30:59,940
and that and I just,
you know,

1932
01:30:59,941 --> 01:31:02,090
just give me a little bit of a loan.

1933
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,390
Okay.
So Phil gives them like $25,000 just

1934
01:31:06,391 --> 01:31:09,660
gives this guy and then the guy calls
him three months later and he asked for

1935
01:31:09,661 --> 01:31:13,080
another 30 and that feels like,
what the fuck man,

1936
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:15,570
you know,
like he was just almost too nice.

1937
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,250
That's about how it usually goes with
that.

1938
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:18,241
It is,
yeah.

1939
01:31:18,241 --> 01:31:20,220
You never lend someone money and then
they go,

1940
01:31:20,221 --> 01:31:23,340
you know what?
You solved all my problems and now I'm

1941
01:31:23,341 --> 01:31:26,280
fine and here's the money back.
It just anybody money.

1942
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:27,263
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1943
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:29,580
Did anybody ever pay you back?
Yes.

1944
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,580
I always to tell this story just because
it's funny.

1945
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:37,320
My friend Dave Raff who manages Pete
Holmes at some point was like

1946
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:40,560
transitioning and starting his own
management company and asked me for some

1947
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:41,550
money.
Not much,

1948
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:45,570
but the only guy who ever paid me back
and quickly.

1949
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:47,790
Yeah,
and that makes sense.

1950
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:51,000
And it is a great man and is producing
my netflix special.

1951
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:52,410
Ah,
well that works.

1952
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:56,520
But the only guy to ever do what he said
he was going to do.

1953
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:58,920
Yeah.
It's always these people that,

1954
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,070
dude,

1955
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:02,950
once this happens and this is going to
happen and I'm going to be making this

1956
01:32:02,951 --> 01:32:04,360
amount of money and don't worry about
it,

1957
01:32:04,361 --> 01:32:06,370
it's all going to come,
but just need a little right now.

1958
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:08,950
It never happened.
Someone said the second people ask for

1959
01:32:08,951 --> 01:32:10,540
money,
they resent you.

1960
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:15,280
And so even if you give people money,
they're mad that they had to ask and

1961
01:32:15,281 --> 01:32:19,060
they kind of hate you because you had to
ask you,

1962
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,130
Ooh,
that's interesting.

1963
01:32:21,131 --> 01:32:22,040
Which,
which I,

1964
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:24,580
which is certainly what you feel.
Well,

1965
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:28,780
there's also the people that think that
the way to make it is to get somebody

1966
01:32:28,781 --> 01:32:33,781
else to get you through.
Like you gotta you gotta call on favors,

1967
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:35,530
you gotta,
you gotta have connections.

1968
01:32:35,531 --> 01:32:38,860
You've got to get your way through that
way that that's the way to do it.

1969
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,420
Somebody gave you a break,
man.

1970
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:42,070
He didn't give me a break.

1971
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:43,670
Somebody gave you a break.
It's like,

1972
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:46,300
it's just,
that mentality is so wrong.

1973
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,860
Oh yeah.
I mean,

1974
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,830
one thing I'm proud of in my career is
they really was.

1975
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:54,400
I had no ins at all.
You know,

1976
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:54,971
I just,
you know,

1977
01:32:54,971 --> 01:32:57,610
my parents got divorced.
They were both bankrupt.

1978
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:01,210
I started interviewing comedians from my
high school radio station at some point

1979
01:33:01,211 --> 01:33:05,200
I got Jamie Masada from the laugh
factory,

1980
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:09,100
the who owns the laugh factory.
He had a magazine in the 80s and he

1981
01:33:09,101 --> 01:33:12,100
printed an interview I did with David
Brenner.

1982
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,710
And I think I did another one with Henny
youngman.

1983
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:16,360
Then when I moved here in [inaudible]
85,

1984
01:33:16,910 --> 01:33:19,130
uh,
I tried to get spots of this laugh

1985
01:33:19,131 --> 01:33:21,580
factory and it was still hard to get up
there,

1986
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:26,260
but I didn't know anybody.
And the person who really hooked me up

1987
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:29,350
with Sammy shore,
wow.

1988
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:31,240
Same Insurance,
started the comedy store it,

1989
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:35,080
then he got divorced and Mitzi took it
over and made it the great place it is.

1990
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:40,150
But he started a comedy room in Marina
del Ray called Sammie's by the shore in

1991
01:33:40,151 --> 01:33:44,350
the back of a fish restaurant.
And he let me book it.

1992
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:49,380
And in return I was allowed to go on and
maybe I got 40 bucks a week.

1993
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:54,820
And that's how I got stage time for the
first year when I didn't know what I was

1994
01:33:54,821 --> 01:33:56,950
doing.
I would book that club,

1995
01:33:56,951 --> 01:33:59,710
which also gave me an excuse to call all
the comics who I admired.

1996
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:01,990
And,
and it's funny,

1997
01:34:01,991 --> 01:34:06,580
like there's those people at a key
moment opened the door for you,

1998
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:10,480
but it's not because you knew them,
it's just because you're willing to put

1999
01:34:10,481 --> 01:34:12,280
it all the work somehow.
Right,

2000
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:14,170
right.
That's interesting,

2001
01:34:14,171 --> 01:34:16,150
man.
Sammie's by the shore.

2002
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:19,030
I never heard about that one.
Do you remember the Valley Improv?

2003
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:21,790
They had one in the Hilton in Sherman
Oaks.

2004
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:23,380
No,
I wasn't around for that.

2005
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,890
And the year was that,
it was like late eighties I wasn't here

2006
01:34:26,891 --> 01:34:29,230
until 94 oh yeah,
the late eighties and this guy,

2007
01:34:29,231 --> 01:34:30,790
Joe drew,
just the manager.

2008
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:33,910
Great Young Guy.
I don't know where he is.

2009
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:35,980
He used to say to me,
Judd,

2010
01:34:35,981 --> 01:34:36,910
come in,
wait around.

2011
01:34:36,911 --> 01:34:38,320
If somebody doesn't show up,
I'll put you up.

2012
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:43,690
And I was like 19 years old and I would
wait there all night,

2013
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:45,910
every night.
Thrilled to talk to everyone because

2014
01:34:45,911 --> 01:34:48,590
that's what right when Sandler moved to
town and David spade and,

2015
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:51,370
and Schneider.
And that's when I first met everybody

2016
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:54,490
and that guy would put me on.
And you know,

2017
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:58,550
that's the funny thing about a career.
It's two or three who,

2018
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:03,610
who change everything for you.
This is woman Mary parents who was one

2019
01:35:03,651 --> 01:35:07,550
of the heads of universal and I was,
I sold her the 40 old virgin and she

2020
01:35:07,551 --> 01:35:08,271
said,
Judd,

2021
01:35:08,271 --> 01:35:12,770
the second you hand in the script,
I'm going to green light it.

2022
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:16,040
I so believe in this idea and you and
Steve.

2023
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:21,640
And I literally faxed her like page 90
to 108 and then she called and said,

2024
01:35:21,831 --> 01:35:23,680
okay,
start prepping facts.

2025
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:25,130
Yeah,
faxed it.

2026
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:27,350
I'm that crazy.
Joe,

2027
01:35:27,351 --> 01:35:28,910
here's my question for you.
Okay,

2028
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:31,760
let's,
let's talk my workout for a second.

2029
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:34,430
Let's Talk My,
uh,

2030
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,210
Omega Brain,
Alphabet Alpha right

2031
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:42,920
now,
Pete Holmes turned me onto the Alpha

2032
01:35:42,921 --> 01:35:47,921
brain and oddly,
it completely works 100% and I'm,

2033
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:52,210
it's all based on science.
I mean,

2034
01:35:52,211 --> 01:35:54,460
we have double blind placebo controlled
studies.

2035
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:57,270
It's not something we invented in terms
of like the,

2036
01:35:57,271 --> 01:36:01,350
the actual nutrients and their response
to human neurotransmitter's.

2037
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:03,900
It's all been documented.
People have known about nutrition

2038
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:07,670
[inaudible] for a long time now.
And I always feel like I'm the perfect

2039
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:13,120
test case for a product like that
because most days I go in a room with 11

2040
01:36:14,031 --> 01:36:18,860
writers in the morning.
I'm as tired and it is foggy as you can

2041
01:36:18,861 --> 01:36:20,930
be.
I do not drink coffee,

2042
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,880
so I don't,
you don't drink coffee at all?

2043
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:24,260
I just don't like it.
So I just,

2044
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:26,800
the only coffee I like his ice blended
Mocha is,

2045
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:28,030
which is all sugar.
Right.

2046
01:36:28,031 --> 01:36:29,570
So I avoided,
uh,

2047
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:34,750
and when I uh,
started taking that I would completely

2048
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:41,770
wake up and be sharp without like some
weird caffeine was or sick from it or

2049
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:47,300
whatever.
And I would see it every day.

2050
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:49,760
Like wow,
I was funny as hell for the last two and

2051
01:36:49,761 --> 01:36:53,120
a half hours and I did not start in that
place.

2052
01:36:53,121 --> 01:36:57,170
So I'm fascinated by your general
program,

2053
01:36:57,171 --> 01:36:59,810
like what you're doing all day with all
this stuff.

2054
01:36:59,811 --> 01:37:02,240
Like what's,
what's the current Joe Program?

2055
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:04,130
Well,
um,

2056
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,460
always doing something,
you know.

2057
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:09,850
And in terms of like diet you mean or in
terms of like

2058
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:12,560
the workout with the Diet,
what's the meditation?

2059
01:37:12,561 --> 01:37:15,260
What's the main tenants of your day?
Well,

2060
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:17,770
my workout,
I schedule every Sunday.

2061
01:37:17,890 --> 01:37:20,170
I schedule everything that I'm going to
do during the week.

2062
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:22,690
I say I have to do yoga two times this
week.

2063
01:37:22,810 --> 01:37:24,580
I have to lift weights three times this
week.

2064
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,540
I have to run twice this week.
And however I fit that in,

2065
01:37:28,541 --> 01:37:30,430
I fit that in.
But I owe those things.

2066
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:31,990
Okay.
So I have to get those things in.

2067
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:34,480
The only exceptions are injuries and
sickness.

2068
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:35,590
So those,
that,

2069
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:36,690
that's the,
the,

2070
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:39,250
the schedule.
And then on top of that,

2071
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:40,850
uh,
there's other things that I enjoyed

2072
01:37:40,851 --> 01:37:41,740
doing.
Kickboxing,

2073
01:37:41,741 --> 01:37:43,780
Jujitsu,
work those in when I can.

2074
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:45,430
Then,
um,

2075
01:37:45,431 --> 01:37:49,120
diet.
The Diet is pretty strict in terms of

2076
01:37:49,121 --> 01:37:51,880
like no bread,
very few carbs,

2077
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:54,130
no sugar,
no bullshit,

2078
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,460
like healthy food,
a lot of vegetables,

2079
01:37:56,590 --> 01:37:57,870
a lot of meat,
game meat,

2080
01:37:57,871 --> 01:38:02,000
mostly wild game.
And I take vitamin supplements every

2081
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,080
day.
I take multivitamins,

2082
01:38:04,081 --> 01:38:07,110
I take probiotics,
I take a vitamin B,

2083
01:38:07,111 --> 01:38:09,330
12 and D and a lot of different things.

2084
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:10,613
I just,
um,

2085
01:38:10,770 --> 01:38:15,770
I do everything that I can to put my
body and my brain in a good place so

2086
01:38:16,201 --> 01:38:20,220
that I'm keeping my engine smooth.
I'm changing my oil,

2087
01:38:20,221 --> 01:38:23,430
I'm changing my spark plugs.
I'm making sure that it's operating.

2088
01:38:23,431 --> 01:38:25,080
I mean it's not going to be perfect,
but yeah,

2089
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:29,460
I know that I've done my best to keep it
working the best that it can.

2090
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:33,720
That who's the person that advises you
on like nutrition because they're a guy,

2091
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:35,450
um,
who told,

2092
01:38:35,550 --> 01:38:36,870
taught you how to do it?
How do you do it?

2093
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:39,780
Well,
there's a ton of people that I've used

2094
01:38:39,781 --> 01:38:41,190
as a resource.
Um,

2095
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:43,500
there's a woman that I have on the
podcast on a regular basis.

2096
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:46,980
Her name is Doctor Rhonda Patrick and
she's probably the best resource.

2097
01:38:46,981 --> 01:38:49,920
Like I sent her something the other day
on some new,

2098
01:38:49,921 --> 01:38:52,800
um,
some new study on saturated fats.

2099
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,600
Like whenever I,
there's some sort of an issue,

2100
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:58,160
there's some new study on cryotherapy or
Saunas.

2101
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,610
Saunas are incredibly effective.
I don't know if you ever just gone,

2102
01:39:01,790 --> 01:39:04,710
oh,
so the UV rays or what is it?

2103
01:39:04,711 --> 01:39:06,720
The,
um,

2104
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:09,430
what is it called?
Not Ultra violent.

2105
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:10,750
Um,
infrared.

2106
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:11,560
They'd be ready.
Yeah,

2107
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,530
we just got one of those Saunas are
giant,

2108
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,570
you know,
the raising of the body temperature like

2109
01:39:15,571 --> 01:39:17,850
that,
and a heat shock proteins,

2110
01:39:17,851 --> 01:39:20,580
incredibly beneficial to your body.
There was a study that they put out

2111
01:39:20,581 --> 01:39:25,581
recently that showed a 40% decrease in
mortality from all causes due to people

2112
01:39:26,191 --> 01:39:28,890
who take regular sauna.
Like it just literally keeps your body

2113
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:30,060
healthier.
Wow.

2114
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:34,770
Having that massive exposure to heat and
the your body producing these heat shock

2115
01:39:34,771 --> 01:39:35,730
proteins,
it just,

2116
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,440
it,
it reduces inflammation.

2117
01:39:37,441 --> 01:39:40,290
It just,
it helps in so many different areas for

2118
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:41,430
people and it's just,
you know,

2119
01:39:41,431 --> 01:39:42,780
sit down in the hot room.

2120
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,420
It's really good for your body.
Regular is how many times a week?

2121
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,220
Um,
for Sauna,

2122
01:39:47,221 --> 01:39:49,350
I think they were saying four times a
week.

2123
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:52,350
But I mean how hard is that man just
force yourself to sit in it?

2124
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:55,320
I mean if you have it at home and in
particular at your gym,

2125
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:58,110
just go there and sit in that fucker for
15 minutes.

2126
01:39:58,111 --> 01:39:59,410
It doesn't take long.
Well,

2127
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:00,650
I mean I have to get all this written
up.

2128
01:40:00,770 --> 01:40:01,710
I'm going to,
how about this?

2129
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:05,850
I do everything you do.
We make that a special,

2130
01:40:05,851 --> 01:40:10,851
it's the judd does Joe's programs.
He's have to heal up the bulk up.

2131
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,460
Well,
I may have already bulked up build up

2132
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:18,150
like your joints and all that stuff.
It's got to get used to that kind of a

2133
01:40:18,151 --> 01:40:19,280
pounding.
Yeah,

2134
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:22,230
there's a lot.
A lot of shit is going to be happening

2135
01:40:22,231 --> 01:40:23,460
if you want to do everything I do.

2136
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:25,380
So I can't just do 12 pounds on a
freeway.

2137
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:26,340
You just,
you don't want,

2138
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:28,860
I mean it's not even,
you don't,

2139
01:40:28,861 --> 01:40:30,570
you're not going to want to do
everything I do.

2140
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:33,960
Like I have a friend who runs ultra
marathons and I just started running

2141
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:37,080
recently within the last couple months.
I'm not running a fucking ultra

2142
01:40:37,081 --> 01:40:38,400
marathon.
I'm not doing everything.

2143
01:40:38,401 --> 01:40:39,720
He,
I'll do everything you do.

2144
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:41,880
I would break.
It would break my feet,

2145
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,470
my knees.
Yeah.

2146
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,290
You got to just build up.
You gotta have time to,

2147
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,460
yes.
There's something about,

2148
01:40:47,461 --> 01:40:49,600
you know when you run a TV shows,
it's all freaking day everyday.

2149
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:50,790
So people will say,
when do you work out?

2150
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:51,960
I'm like,
there's no time.

2151
01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:55,150
What am I going to wake up at in the
morning and put in two and a half hours?

2152
01:40:55,151 --> 01:40:57,100
I,
I drive my kids to school at seven 40.

2153
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:58,150
That's one thing.

2154
01:40:58,150 --> 01:40:59,640
You don't need two and a half hours.
Yeah.

2155
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:02,950
You could get a great workout in,
in 40 minutes and that's all you need

2156
01:41:02,951 --> 01:41:04,300
for the whole day.
100%.

2157
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:07,210
You really can't,
especially if you run like I run hills

2158
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:11,830
and I can get it done in a half an hour,
like a fucking brutal workout,

2159
01:41:11,831 --> 01:41:15,340
a two mile brutal hill climbing workout
in half hour,

2160
01:41:15,341 --> 01:41:16,560
I'm exhausted.
Yeah.

2161
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:18,430
You know,
this idea of time,

2162
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:22,420
like how much time did you put in today?
Like you could work out in a bullshit

2163
01:41:22,421 --> 01:41:26,980
manner for two hours and not get nearly
as much done as you can for a half hour.

2164
01:41:26,981 --> 01:41:28,830
Hard just running.
Yeah.

2165
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:30,450
We're like interval training.
Yeah.

2166
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,830
Yeah.
Sprints and then relax.

2167
01:41:32,831 --> 01:41:34,780
Then sprints again.
But uh,

2168
01:41:34,781 --> 01:41:38,110
I just think being active and doing
something on a daily basis,

2169
01:41:38,111 --> 01:41:41,290
forcing your body to get used to the
fact that it's going to constantly

2170
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:44,170
being,
be working constantly being under

2171
01:41:44,171 --> 01:41:45,880
stress,
and then it just,

2172
01:41:45,910 --> 01:41:46,840
it gives you more energy.

2173
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:50,980
It's like you have more of a gas tank,
you have more enthusiasm for things.

2174
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:54,430
That's the scary part about trump.
His theory on exercises.

2175
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:58,780
You only have so much energy per day and
he thinks that exercise uses it up.

2176
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,700
Yeah.
And so he doesn't ever exercise.

2177
01:42:01,670 --> 01:42:03,380
That's got to come back out of it
someplace.

2178
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:06,940
Just fucking 70 I mean how was it?
And I come back at him already,

2179
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:08,810
but he also,
I mean he's,

2180
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:11,740
he's not mitigating it stress.
That's part of it.

2181
01:42:11,741 --> 01:42:15,790
Is Your perspective enhancing?
For me the most important thing about,

2182
01:42:15,791 --> 01:42:17,860
I don't think maybe they're not the most
important thing.

2183
01:42:17,861 --> 01:42:21,640
One of the best things about exercise is
that it gives me a perspective,

2184
01:42:21,890 --> 01:42:23,530
a better,
a more enhanced perspective.

2185
01:42:23,531 --> 01:42:26,800
Cause I know I'm not coming at it from a
stressful body.

2186
01:42:26,801 --> 01:42:30,730
Like my body is not tense so I can come
at things in a calm way.

2187
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:33,150
I've drained all the bullshit out of my
budget thing.

2188
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:36,280
Yeah.
And Are you doing meditation or what are

2189
01:42:36,281 --> 01:42:38,710
you doing in that way?
I have a sensory deprivation tank.

2190
01:42:38,711 --> 01:42:41,110
Yeah.
So I do most of my meditation in that

2191
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:44,470
you do an ultra climb and yeah,
a climate and I float.

2192
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,880
Yeah,
I love that.

2193
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:47,800
That's one of my favorite things that
you ever do it?

2194
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:50,290
Uh,
no I couldn't imagine you must

2195
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,900
especially for you because you're
working on things all the time.

2196
01:42:52,901 --> 01:42:56,150
Like if you go in there with an idea
like I'll go in there with a bit like I

2197
01:42:56,151 --> 01:42:58,180
got this bit that I'm working on right
now,

2198
01:42:58,181 --> 01:43:02,080
that's kind of complicated and sometimes
we'll just be sitting there staring at

2199
01:43:02,081 --> 01:43:03,910
the wall.
Just thinking about this one bit because

2200
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:06,190
I'm trying to figure out how to,
how to structure it.

2201
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:10,390
It's just super complicated bit and I'll
go in that tank and I'll just sit there

2202
01:43:10,391 --> 01:43:13,870
for an hour and I'll just try to work
out this bit and tried to figure out if

2203
01:43:13,871 --> 01:43:16,360
there are other angles to it is other
ways to come at it.

2204
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:20,230
The only confusing thing is when I have
an idea in the tank and it seems like I

2205
01:43:20,231 --> 01:43:21,910
got it,
I got to get out of the tank and then I

2206
01:43:21,911 --> 01:43:25,000
got to write things down.
And you need a special pad and the pen.

2207
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:28,060
I think I need a voice activated
recorder.

2208
01:43:28,061 --> 01:43:29,590
I think that's a good idea.
Yeah,

2209
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:31,810
I think that's what I need.
Where I can just talk.

2210
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:33,011
Yeah.
Okay.

2211
01:43:33,011 --> 01:43:35,530
So I need the tank.
You need to have the spa.

2212
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:37,110
You have a spa.
Um,

2213
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:39,790
I need a hill to run on hills are good.
I got,

2214
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:43,120
I need more of my audit products.
Do you lift weights at all?

2215
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,260
Uh,
no.

2216
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:48,700
I good idea to do a little bit of
something just to keep your body strong.

2217
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,130
It's like as you get older,
your body atrophies and

2218
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:54,800
there's just no way around it.
Especially if you're not using it.

2219
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:58,970
And the only way to keep it from
atrophying is to make sure that you put

2220
01:43:58,971 --> 01:44:01,430
it under stress.
You have to lift weights.

2221
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:03,260
It's the only way it keeps your bone
density,

2222
01:44:03,261 --> 01:44:05,540
keeps your tendon strength,
your muscle strength.

2223
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:07,400
There's no other way,
you know,

2224
01:44:07,401 --> 01:44:09,770
and otherwise he's got injuries.
People get back into reason.

2225
01:44:09,771 --> 01:44:12,140
Arm injuries and shit just starts
falling apart on,

2226
01:44:12,141 --> 01:44:12,681
you.
See,

2227
01:44:12,681 --> 01:44:14,720
I've had no injuries due to not doing
anything.

2228
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,570
That's how I've been protecting by my
body.

2229
01:44:17,571 --> 01:44:19,490
But yes,
I do know that that's the thing to do.

2230
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:23,060
I remember I always heard about Clint
Eastwood doing that and I met Clint

2231
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:25,010
Eastwood when he was like 80.
And I know he's like,

2232
01:44:25,011 --> 01:44:26,540
he lifts heavyweights.
That's his thing.

2233
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:30,470
It's like heavyweights.
And he was a truck at 80.

2234
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:31,910
Yeah.
And so,

2235
01:44:31,911 --> 01:44:33,470
uh,
but I don't like,

2236
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,780
uh,
lifting things.

2237
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:41,000
I don't even like counting,
counting hire a trainer.

2238
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,200
Yeah.
You know,

2239
01:44:42,201 --> 01:44:44,600
get someone to devise a program.
Yeah.

2240
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:46,910
Have them come to you,
work you out.

2241
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:48,740
You don't have to do shit.
You just show up.

2242
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:50,810
You know,
like you could do it in your house.

2243
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,330
They show up at 6:00 AM or whenever it
is and like,

2244
01:44:53,331 --> 01:44:55,970
come on John,
I got you for the next 45 minutes and

2245
01:44:55,971 --> 01:44:56,840
you're like,
all right,

2246
01:44:56,841 --> 01:44:58,700
here we go.
And just make,

2247
01:44:58,701 --> 01:45:02,600
when you hate that stuff really is tough
when you haven't built your brain to

2248
01:45:02,601 --> 01:45:04,640
love it.
I've been playing a lot of tennis lately

2249
01:45:04,641 --> 01:45:09,560
as a way to great wake up and uh,
but I do know that I need to do it,

2250
01:45:09,561 --> 01:45:12,380
but man,
it is when you're like of the mindset

2251
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,750
that when the trainer comes,
you want to punch him in the face.

2252
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,090
It's a tough,
it's a tough thing.

2253
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,520
I know a lot of it is being a writer.
Your,

2254
01:45:19,521 --> 01:45:23,510
your day becomes about waking up and
engaging your brain all day.

2255
01:45:23,511 --> 01:45:27,050
And so you just like look at writers and
eat Chinese food and you're kicking

2256
01:45:27,051 --> 01:45:30,650
stuff around and it's like developing
the wrong muscle your whole life or at

2257
01:45:30,651 --> 01:45:34,550
least not only one muscle.
And uh,

2258
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:38,210
I know that I have to transition into
that,

2259
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:40,900
but it is,
it is a tough one to one.

2260
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:42,510
I stopped,
I official to your writing.

2261
01:45:42,511 --> 01:45:46,070
Now it is,
it 100% is I write better after I do

2262
01:45:46,071 --> 01:45:49,700
anything.
And what I do do is I walk really fast

2263
01:45:49,701 --> 01:45:53,360
around my neighborhood in circles for
like 45 minutes every day.

2264
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:55,130
They say,
you should do that after you're right.

2265
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:57,680
They say when you ride,
one of the things you should do is go

2266
01:45:57,681 --> 01:46:02,060
over what you wrote by going on a walk
because it's not enough where you're so

2267
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:04,600
worn out that you're occupied by the,
like,

2268
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:06,920
it's not like you're running or you're
exhausted.

2269
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:10,430
You're occupied by the activity.
Cause I feel like when I'm running hard,

2270
01:46:10,431 --> 01:46:14,390
especially when I do my hill sprints,
I'm not thinking about shit other than

2271
01:46:14,391 --> 01:46:15,440
left foot.
Right foot,

2272
01:46:15,441 --> 01:46:16,400
left foot,
right foot.

2273
01:46:16,401 --> 01:46:18,110
Don't fall down,
keep going.

2274
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:20,090
We're almost at the hill,
almost at the top.

2275
01:46:20,091 --> 01:46:21,230
Keep going,
keep going,

2276
01:46:21,231 --> 01:46:22,880
keep going.
I don't wanna thinking about anything

2277
01:46:22,881 --> 01:46:25,250
else,
but when I walk I can think about all

2278
01:46:25,251 --> 01:46:27,260
kinds of shit.
So I walk my dog around the neighborhood

2279
01:46:27,261 --> 01:46:28,430
a lot of times after that.
Right.

2280
01:46:28,830 --> 01:46:30,230
Just take him.
We'll go for a walk.

2281
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:32,670
And that's like a walking meditation.
Yeah.

2282
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:33,641
Yeah.
Cause I'm,

2283
01:46:33,641 --> 01:46:37,190
I'm trying to read a lot like,
and you guys talk about it sometimes.

2284
01:46:37,191 --> 01:46:38,600
I heard you talking about with Russell
brand,

2285
01:46:38,601 --> 01:46:39,770
just,
you know,

2286
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:44,800
quantum physics and trying to figure out
how to quiet my brain and to tune into

2287
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:49,980
what is left to

2288
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,270
do,
to not be crazy.

2289
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:54,450
And some of that is exercise because
left to do,

2290
01:46:54,451 --> 01:46:55,860
to not be crazy.
Exactly.

2291
01:46:56,630 --> 01:46:59,970
Cause I was such a like a such a pop
psychology junkie.

2292
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:01,890
Yeah.
I read that stuff all day long.

2293
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:05,120
But lately I've been reading a little
more like the,

2294
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:06,900
you know,
the Joe Dispenza,

2295
01:47:06,901 --> 01:47:08,490
is that his name?
Joe Dispenza.

2296
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:09,301
Yeah.
But it's,

2297
01:47:09,301 --> 01:47:09,841
you know,
it's just,

2298
01:47:09,841 --> 01:47:13,470
it's,
it's a cook quantum physics theory that

2299
01:47:13,471 --> 01:47:18,471
basically you get into a pattern of how
you feel and it's in yourself.

2300
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:21,030
So if you're a depressed person,
like yourselves are depressed and if you

2301
01:47:21,031 --> 01:47:23,820
get in a good mood,
your cells try to get you back to

2302
01:47:23,821 --> 01:47:28,080
depression because you've conditioned
yourself to be in a certain mood all the

2303
01:47:28,081 --> 01:47:33,000
time physically and it affects your
whole body and that you can make a

2304
01:47:33,001 --> 01:47:38,001
choice to change how you are physically
by choosing to be in a certain mood and

2305
01:47:40,681 --> 01:47:45,480
meditating about a certain mood and that
you could change how your body reacts

2306
01:47:45,481 --> 01:47:47,670
physically.
So it doesn't want to keep you in the

2307
01:47:47,671 --> 01:47:50,250
same mental state you're used to being
in.

2308
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,680
Does that make any sense?
It does sort of,

2309
01:47:52,681 --> 01:47:55,950
I guess I'm always real cautious about
what,

2310
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:59,880
what causes depression and what makes
people depressed and what,

2311
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:01,463
you know,

2312
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:04,070
I don't,
I don't suffer from depression,

2313
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:07,280
so like whenever someone says you're
depressed because of this,

2314
01:48:07,281 --> 01:48:08,240
I'm always like,
hmm,

2315
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:10,610
okay.
I don't know how to address that because

2316
01:48:10,611 --> 01:48:13,550
I don't know what,
I know there's certain people that do

2317
01:48:13,551 --> 01:48:16,850
have absolute chemical imbalances,
but what does that chemical imbalance

2318
01:48:16,851 --> 01:48:18,650
come from?
Does it come from childhood trauma?

2319
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:21,980
Does it come from just some sort of a
part of their body that's not

2320
01:48:21,981 --> 01:48:24,980
functioning correctly,
like a bad thyroid or a bad kidney?

2321
01:48:25,130 --> 01:48:30,130
Is the brain like very similar?
Is that the case or are they in a bad

2322
01:48:30,471 --> 01:48:34,130
economic situation?
In a bad relationship with bad friends

2323
01:48:34,131 --> 01:48:36,740
and a bad job?
Is that what's causing depression?

2324
01:48:36,741 --> 01:48:38,540
Like I think there's a host of
variables.

2325
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:39,940
Yeah,
it's a,

2326
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:41,920
you get an a pattern.
You don't know.

2327
01:48:41,950 --> 01:48:45,340
You don't know why.
I mean your family to do your parents.

2328
01:48:45,341 --> 01:48:48,340
Uh,
did they stay together?

2329
01:48:48,370 --> 01:48:49,181
No.
Yeah.

2330
01:48:49,181 --> 01:48:50,014
So you

2331
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:53,820
step ma or my stepdad rather,
and my mom had been together since I was

2332
01:48:53,821 --> 01:48:54,320
seven.
Yeah.

2333
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,260
So you had the stable.
Yes.

2334
01:48:56,430 --> 01:48:57,230
Yeah.
And I think that's,

2335
01:48:57,230 --> 01:49:00,500
I always think that's 90% of it.
When you grow up in chaos,

2336
01:49:00,501 --> 01:49:03,650
I think you get wired for a certain
hyper vigilance and,

2337
01:49:03,651 --> 01:49:08,651
and nervousness and anxiety because you
think like more bad shit's coming.

2338
01:49:08,890 --> 01:49:10,610
Yeah.
So if you had any kind of trauma as a

2339
01:49:10,611 --> 01:49:12,890
kid,
I think you're wired to keep your eyes

2340
01:49:12,891 --> 01:49:15,500
open a little wider,
which also lends itself to some kind of

2341
01:49:15,501 --> 01:49:17,060
depression.
It could,

2342
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:19,010
most certainly for me,
uh,

2343
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:21,450
that hypervigilance led itself to
martial arts.

2344
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:22,620
Yeah.
And then it's also,

2345
01:49:22,621 --> 01:49:24,750
we moved around a lot,
so I was picked on a lot,

2346
01:49:24,751 --> 01:49:26,250
so I was like,
I was always the new kid.

2347
01:49:26,251 --> 01:49:26,881
I was like,
God,

2348
01:49:26,881 --> 01:49:28,680
this fucking sucks,
you know?

2349
01:49:28,681 --> 01:49:32,010
So that,
that sort of led me to be wary of others

2350
01:49:32,011 --> 01:49:33,030
and just,
you know,

2351
01:49:33,031 --> 01:49:34,960
be internalize a lot of stuff.
Sure.

2352
01:49:34,970 --> 01:49:36,270
Um,
I think I,

2353
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:38,220
that's what I did.
I just went in my room and watch the

2354
01:49:38,221 --> 01:49:40,680
Mike Douglas show and watch Merv
Griffin.

2355
01:49:40,681 --> 01:49:41,610
Did you know,
you knew,

2356
01:49:41,611 --> 01:49:44,250
so that from the time you were 17,
you were working at East side comedy

2357
01:49:44,251 --> 01:49:46,020
club,
you kind of knew you always wanted to be

2358
01:49:46,021 --> 01:49:48,040
involved in common.
From the time I was 10,

2359
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:52,990
I was into the Marx brothers first,
then like cosby and George Carlin and,

2360
01:49:53,530 --> 01:49:55,780
uh,
I used to listen to lenny bruce records

2361
01:49:55,781 --> 01:49:57,070
as a kid.
I didn't understand them,

2362
01:49:57,071 --> 01:50:00,670
but I just heard that's the best person.
And I always,

2363
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:05,500
I think I liked that comedians just
called out bullshit.

2364
01:50:05,501 --> 01:50:08,170
And I must have felt like there was a
lot of bullshit around me because I

2365
01:50:08,171 --> 01:50:09,890
liked the and called.
Yeah,

2366
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:11,650
I liked that.
It was like George Carlin was like,

2367
01:50:11,651 --> 01:50:13,150
no,
this makes no fucking sense.

2368
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:15,940
And so I love those people.
And,

2369
01:50:15,950 --> 01:50:17,320
and,
and the lighter stuff too,

2370
01:50:17,321 --> 01:50:22,180
like just silly comedians who just
pointed out the ridiculousness of

2371
01:50:22,181 --> 01:50:23,810
things.
So I loved Seinfeld when I was a kid

2372
01:50:23,811 --> 01:50:24,820
and,
and Leno,

2373
01:50:24,821 --> 01:50:27,190
but especially Carlin,
I think when I was little,

2374
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:32,140
well Groucho Marx is pretty underrated
and under appreciated to this day.

2375
01:50:32,141 --> 01:50:34,090
Like my roommate,
he was hosting that show you bet your

2376
01:50:34,091 --> 01:50:34,901
life.
Oh,

2377
01:50:34,901 --> 01:50:39,660
absolutely.
So funny and so dirty and weird people

2378
01:50:39,670 --> 01:50:40,480
like,
and,

2379
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:41,710
and even like when you watch them and be
like,

2380
01:50:41,711 --> 01:50:43,240
duck soup,
the Marx brothers movie,

2381
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:46,060
it's all about the ridiculousness of
government.

2382
01:50:46,061 --> 01:50:49,600
And uh,
and something drew me to those people.

2383
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:54,630
I think it was also because I was bad at
sports and so I thought this system's

2384
01:50:55,150 --> 01:50:55,781
unfair.
Like,

2385
01:50:55,781 --> 01:50:58,000
so I'm a Dick because I can't play
softball.

2386
01:51:00,330 --> 01:51:02,590
So it led me to like look for something
else.

2387
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:05,020
But back then,
no one else likes comedy.

2388
01:51:05,021 --> 01:51:07,360
There wasn't another person to talk to
about it.

2389
01:51:07,540 --> 01:51:10,540
Now I think everyone likes it.
But back then there was no one was

2390
01:51:10,541 --> 01:51:13,270
watching Merv Griffin but me really when
I was little,

2391
01:51:13,271 --> 01:51:16,120
I mean it,
when I was 15 I didn't like come to

2392
01:51:16,121 --> 01:51:20,230
school and we would laugh about Jeff
Altman on Merv Griffin.

2393
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,390
I was just alone with it.

2394
01:51:22,830 --> 01:51:24,090
Wow.
Yeah.

2395
01:51:24,091 --> 01:51:28,500
I became a fan of a standup watching
standup on TV,

2396
01:51:28,530 --> 01:51:31,860
like watching like the tonight show and
evening at the Improv and stuff like

2397
01:51:31,861 --> 01:51:34,050
that.
But really the big one,

2398
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:38,400
the run that really kicked in for me was
my parents took me to see live on the

2399
01:51:38,401 --> 01:51:39,750
sunset strip.
Oh Wow.

2400
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:41,970
And I was a teenager,
young teenager.

2401
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,790
And uh,
I remember being in the audience while

2402
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:49,740
Richard Pryor was onstage slaying and
people were laughing so hard and I was

2403
01:51:49,741 --> 01:51:51,390
laughing so hard.
I looked around,

2404
01:51:51,391 --> 01:51:55,470
I'll never forget this moment cause I
looked around at the crowd while the

2405
01:51:55,471 --> 01:52:00,060
movie was going on and all these people
were like falling out of their chairs

2406
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:02,400
after their knee holding her chest.
And I was like,

2407
01:52:02,401 --> 01:52:04,950
this guy's just talking.
He's just talking.

2408
01:52:04,951 --> 01:52:07,170
And he's this funny,
this is incredible.

2409
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,600
I'm like,
this is an amazing thing this guy can do

2410
01:52:09,870 --> 01:52:12,000
like I'd never seen real standup before.

2411
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:13,920
I had only seen like,
you know,

2412
01:52:13,921 --> 01:52:17,370
like someone on the Johnny Carson show
do a couple minutes and tell a few

2413
01:52:17,371 --> 01:52:19,980
jokes.
That in my mind was what stand up was.

2414
01:52:20,250 --> 01:52:23,160
It wasn't until,
and I had listened to some of the old

2415
01:52:23,161 --> 01:52:26,150
bill cosby stuff and some of the old
Carlin stuff on,

2416
01:52:26,210 --> 01:52:27,660
on uh,
records,

2417
01:52:27,810 --> 01:52:32,700
but I'd never seen it like seeing the
movie live on the sunset strip and that

2418
01:52:32,701 --> 01:52:35,760
planted didn't plant a seed.
Like I can do it,

2419
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,220
but it did plant a seed.
Like Holy Shit,

2420
01:52:38,221 --> 01:52:40,830
this is possible.
Like this is crazy that this is

2421
01:52:40,831 --> 01:52:42,480
possible.
It's still the best special.

2422
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:44,370
It's one of the best ever.
Without a doubt.

2423
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,280
He's still,
he holds up in a,

2424
01:52:46,281 --> 01:52:49,670
in a very,
very unique way where a lot of comedy

2425
01:52:49,671 --> 01:52:54,110
from that era just immune including
lenny bruce doesn't really hold up like

2426
01:52:54,111 --> 01:52:56,390
gets caught be.
It's because it's contextual.

2427
01:52:56,570 --> 01:52:59,870
Like if you were there in that time,
it was groundbreaking,

2428
01:53:00,290 --> 01:53:04,340
but that's not groundbreaking anymore
because the culture has moved on so far.

2429
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:08,570
And a lot of that could be attributed to
his insight like Lenny Bruce incite

2430
01:53:08,730 --> 01:53:12,650
change the way a lot of people thought
and discussed a lot of like really

2431
01:53:12,651 --> 01:53:16,310
important issues at that time.
But there was something about priors,

2432
01:53:16,610 --> 01:53:21,610
his honesty and his,
his delivery and his point of view

2433
01:53:21,741 --> 01:53:24,260
that's like to this day like God,
he was good.

2434
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:24,711
I,
I,

2435
01:53:24,711 --> 01:53:28,040
there was a record they put out a few
years ago where they didn't tell you

2436
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:32,090
what album it was,
but it was just bits and I think maybe a

2437
01:53:32,091 --> 01:53:35,450
lot of,
of of bits that were recorded when he

2438
01:53:35,451 --> 01:53:37,630
recorded an album but didn't make the
album.

2439
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:39,170
Like it was just,
it was,

2440
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:39,950
it was,
uh,

2441
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:41,870
an eras like seventies,
80s,

2442
01:53:41,871 --> 01:53:44,570
90s.
And when you listen to his stuff from

2443
01:53:44,571 --> 01:53:46,700
the 70s,
it's so militant.

2444
01:53:46,770 --> 01:53:50,750
Yeah.
It's so milton and it all works

2445
01:53:50,751 --> 01:53:53,420
perfectly today.
Like what he's mad about.

2446
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:56,330
Yeah,
all applies to right now.

2447
01:53:56,360 --> 01:54:00,320
And then when he goes honest about
himself and relationships,

2448
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:02,030
you do feel it.
Like,

2449
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:03,920
oh,
there's not many people opening it up

2450
01:54:03,921 --> 01:54:05,270
like this.
Right.

2451
01:54:05,470 --> 01:54:09,470
Like there's not a comparable person.
There's a lot of comedians who talk

2452
01:54:09,471 --> 01:54:10,880
about their lives,
but he's really,

2453
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:15,830
he's ripping open the,
the veins much deeper than anybody even

2454
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:16,700
now.
Sure.

2455
01:54:16,701 --> 01:54:20,150
And he was talking about horrific
addiction issues that he had back then.

2456
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:22,250
I mean,
addiction issues that caused them to

2457
01:54:22,251 --> 01:54:23,800
light himself on fire.
Yeah.

2458
01:54:24,110 --> 01:54:27,080
I mean when he was talking about that
back then,

2459
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,630
who the hell had done that?
You remember he would do that thing.

2460
01:54:29,631 --> 01:54:31,840
We would light a match and,
and move it around.

2461
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:33,171
Like what,
who am I?

2462
01:54:33,171 --> 01:54:37,430
I'm Richard Pryor running down the
street and joke around about lighting

2463
01:54:37,431 --> 01:54:40,550
himself on fire and,
and have the whole audience laugh.

2464
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:42,290
It was like,
wow.

2465
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:45,710
It was crazy.
There was some bits where he talked

2466
01:54:45,711 --> 01:54:49,940
about having multiple sclerosis near the
end of his life and he was still doing

2467
01:54:49,941 --> 01:54:54,760
the comedy store and on audio they were
riot asleep.

2468
01:54:54,761 --> 01:54:58,790
Funny,
brutally honest bits about,

2469
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,610
you know,
what it felt like to be that sick.

2470
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:05,180
And I don't think it ever was on an
album before when he was doing that.

2471
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:06,290
Um,
when he was,

2472
01:55:06,291 --> 01:55:07,760
uh,
coming back to the comedy store when he

2473
01:55:07,761 --> 01:55:11,210
was really sick before he died,
I was the guy who went on after him

2474
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:14,140
every night,
every night for like five weeks.

2475
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:15,860
So Geez,
every time he did his show,

2476
01:55:15,861 --> 01:55:18,500
I bombed so many times going on after
Richard Pryor.

2477
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,840
Oh,
it was death.

2478
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:23,630
And how was he terrible?
He was,

2479
01:55:23,710 --> 01:55:28,580
he was old and he was sick and he was
drunk and he was on pills and he

2480
01:55:28,581 --> 01:55:31,340
probably shouldn't have been there,
but he just wanted to do it.

2481
01:55:31,730 --> 01:55:33,440
It wasn't good.
Like it wasn't,

2482
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,510
it wasn't Richard Pryor.
It was like they had it,

2483
01:55:35,511 --> 01:55:37,520
first of all,
he was really unhealthy so they had to

2484
01:55:37,521 --> 01:55:38,780
crank the microphone up.
Like

2485
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:42,360
you couldn't even hear Shira

2486
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,650
barely hear him and you know,
he would like,

2487
01:55:44,810 --> 01:55:47,520
I always love pussy.
Like it wasn't,

2488
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:48,850
there was nothing there.
Yeah,

2489
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:51,570
he was just kind of talking and ranting
and he would,

2490
01:55:51,610 --> 01:55:53,970
you know,
he'd be on stage with a drink and people

2491
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,800
didn't know how to respond and they
would give him this amazing round of

2492
01:55:58,801 --> 01:56:01,380
applause when he got on stage.
And it took forever for them to get them

2493
01:56:01,381 --> 01:56:06,000
to the stage because chewy who worked
the door and this guy dave,

2494
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:09,720
um,
would carry Richard prior to the stage

2495
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:13,830
and slowly just move him towards the
stage and all the time that people would

2496
01:56:13,831 --> 01:56:17,070
be clapping and then they would sit him
down and then they would put the

2497
01:56:17,071 --> 01:56:21,150
microphone in place and crank that
fucking thing up to 10 and then he would

2498
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:22,950
do is stand up.
But it was,

2499
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:28,430
it was people almost like paying all
much Omaj the paying homage.

2500
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:31,110
They were there,
they were there to see the great one,

2501
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:33,390
you know,
when he was there and he's still alive

2502
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:34,230
and it's like,
wow,

2503
01:56:34,230 --> 01:56:37,020
we're seeing like the greatest standup
comedian of all time.

2504
01:56:37,021 --> 01:56:38,880
He's right there.
Wow.

2505
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:41,880
You know,
it was more of that than it was like him

2506
01:56:41,881 --> 01:56:44,070
doing really well.
It was never like a good set.

2507
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:45,240
I never saw him kill.

2508
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:48,600
And then you would come out,
how was he eat dick just go up there and

2509
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:52,320
just eat plates of Shit.
People were so depressed.

2510
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:55,890
So way on.
What was your attempt to uh,

2511
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:58,440
to pull out of it?
Um,

2512
01:56:58,441 --> 01:57:03,360
I would go on stage and I would say,
and now ladies and gentlemen and unknown

2513
01:57:03,361 --> 01:57:06,960
White Guy after the greatest comedians
of all time,

2514
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:10,530
this douchey looking Italian looking
kid,

2515
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:14,670
I would just make fun of myself for a
few minutes and you know,

2516
01:57:14,671 --> 01:57:15,504
and then sometimes

2517
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:17,210
about how,
uh,

2518
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:19,470
Richard Pryor was like,
you know,

2519
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:23,190
cause I would take a long time for him
to get off the stage too.

2520
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:26,610
So that was the other thing.
Like I would get introduced by Jeff

2521
01:57:26,670 --> 01:57:31,670
who's a piano man and I would pass
Richard and Dave and Chewy as they were

2522
01:57:32,071 --> 01:57:35,250
carrying Richard off.
Like you'd have to kind of move around

2523
01:57:35,251 --> 01:57:37,920
them and then get onto the stage and
then you'd have to say,

2524
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:39,330
Richard Pryor,
ladies and gentlemen,

2525
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,610
give it,
and sometimes ppc people's eyes,

2526
01:57:41,611 --> 01:57:42,840
they were like,
fuck,

2527
01:57:43,370 --> 01:57:44,520
like,
what did we just see?

2528
01:57:44,521 --> 01:57:46,890
Like this is so to facing their own
mortality.

2529
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:47,880
Yeah,
absolutely.

2530
01:57:47,881 --> 01:57:49,520
Yeah.
And you know Richard,

2531
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:53,940
like I remember like he wasn't supposed
to drink but he drank anyway cause they

2532
01:57:53,941 --> 01:57:57,060
had them on all this medication and
you're like fuck you just kept drinking.

2533
01:57:57,860 --> 01:57:59,240
It was weird.
It was,

2534
01:57:59,310 --> 01:58:00,143
it was dark.

2535
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:02,540
I remember meeting him at a birthday
party.

2536
01:58:02,990 --> 01:58:06,770
I went with Jim character to his
birthday party and it was,

2537
01:58:06,890 --> 01:58:08,330
it was sad.
I mean it was,

2538
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:12,290
it was sad to see but somebody that ill
and then especially when you think of

2539
01:58:12,291 --> 01:58:17,291
just the power of the guy,
just how crazy funny he was.

2540
01:58:17,331 --> 01:58:19,730
Cause there's not that many people just
took the core funny.

2541
01:58:19,731 --> 01:58:21,710
They,
I remember when Robin Williams,

2542
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:26,740
we used to come into the Improv in the
late eighties and he would kill so hard.

2543
01:58:28,730 --> 01:58:31,970
There was just no way to recover the
room couldn't recover.

2544
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:34,790
Yeah.
And there's not that many people can do

2545
01:58:34,791 --> 01:58:36,290
that now.
I feel like people could follow each

2546
01:58:36,291 --> 01:58:38,090
other now.
You know Louie comes in and you go on

2547
01:58:38,091 --> 01:58:40,550
after him and you know and,
and like he kills.

2548
01:58:40,551 --> 01:58:44,080
But like Robin Williams would come in
like you wanted to end the show,

2549
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:44,650
right?

2550
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:46,240
Well,
there was only one of him then,

2551
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,250
you know,
and now there's like Louis,

2552
01:58:48,251 --> 01:58:50,770
but then there's bird and then there's
Diaz and then there's,

2553
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:54,610
there's a lot of guys now,
there's Santino and Ari Shaffir and this

2554
01:58:54,611 --> 01:58:57,400
like,
there's so many funny people now maybe

2555
01:58:57,401 --> 01:59:01,900
the audience understands in a different
way and they can transition.

2556
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:03,960
They,
they're,

2557
01:59:04,030 --> 01:59:05,830
they're used to comedy and they're like,
oh,

2558
01:59:05,831 --> 01:59:08,420
now this guy where the old days you'd
come on and there's,

2559
01:59:08,770 --> 01:59:10,510
you know,
they couldn't go and,

2560
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:12,580
oh,
we're about to enjoy this,

2561
01:59:12,581 --> 01:59:14,880
this popery of people.
Right.

2562
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:16,930
Well,
she's still see people bomb after

2563
01:59:16,931 --> 01:59:18,160
someone who kills.
Yeah.

2564
01:59:18,330 --> 01:59:20,140
Still,
that's still happens all the time.

2565
01:59:20,470 --> 01:59:22,760
But I think that,
um,

2566
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:25,960
maybe I was more,
I think what you're getting at the store

2567
01:59:25,961 --> 01:59:27,850
now,
and this is what's been really

2568
01:59:27,851 --> 01:59:30,880
interesting lately,
is you're getting a lot of comedy

2569
01:59:30,881 --> 01:59:31,890
tourism.
Yeah.

2570
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:35,720
Like a lot of people fly over from
Europe just to come to the store all in

2571
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:36,970
lot a lot.

2572
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,160
And it's worth it.
Those lineups are crazy.

2573
01:59:39,161 --> 01:59:40,230
Some night.
Oh yeah.

2574
01:59:40,231 --> 01:59:41,590
Like,
I'll look at the lineup and go,

2575
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:45,220
does this audience understand how insane
this is?

2576
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:46,143
Yeah,
yeah.

2577
01:59:46,510 --> 01:59:48,430
And there's three shows going on
simultaneously.

2578
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:51,130
There's a belly room,
the original room in the main room and

2579
01:59:51,131 --> 01:59:52,810
everyone,
and you know a lot of guys do hat

2580
01:59:52,811 --> 01:59:53,411
tricks.
Well,

2581
01:59:53,411 --> 01:59:56,350
they'll do all three rooms and one night
the seller's like that,

2582
01:59:56,351 --> 01:59:59,500
the comedy cellar in New York,
there's three rooms and you go in some

2583
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:00,550
nights and it's like,
yeah.

2584
02:00:00,551 --> 02:00:04,480
Chappelle's come in.
Rock just left like really tonight?

2585
02:00:04,481 --> 02:00:05,680
Yeah.
Schumer's here.

2586
02:00:06,010 --> 02:00:10,750
There's only a few of those places I had
to follow Andrew Dice Clay and Ray

2587
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:11,590
Romano,
the seller.

2588
02:00:11,591 --> 02:00:14,980
Once it was like the cleanest guy and
the dirtiest guy.

2589
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:20,520
Do you know I had the worst sets after
ever ways it could not follow Martin

2590
02:00:21,010 --> 02:00:21,580
Lawrence.
Oh yeah.

2591
02:00:21,580 --> 02:00:23,200
Martin Lawrence in the 90s sure.

2592
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:27,700
I remembered Chris Rock says that Martin
Lawrence was opening up for him in the

2593
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:28,960
90s,
uh,

2594
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,090
or,
or you know,

2595
02:00:30,130 --> 02:00:34,210
before he did his big specials and that
he was downstairs in the dressing room

2596
02:00:34,211 --> 02:00:39,211
and he could feel the theater rocking.
And he went on stage and he said he had

2597
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:44,740
had some shows where he couldn't follow
him the way he wanted to and that's what

2598
02:00:44,741 --> 02:00:49,741
made him work hard and then develop
those great specials because having

2599
02:00:49,751 --> 02:00:51,850
Martin opened for him scared him.
Yeah.

2600
02:00:51,851 --> 02:00:54,850
Well he also said that he did too many
crowds in front of white people.

2601
02:00:54,910 --> 02:00:57,280
Yeah.
Too many shows in front of white crowds

2602
02:00:57,310 --> 02:01:01,020
and they were just too,
too happy and too,

2603
02:01:01,090 --> 02:01:05,290
except day and Martin Lawrence or just
bring the thunder dude.

2604
02:01:05,291 --> 02:01:10,090
He was so strong before he put the
wetsuit on and ran around with a gun in

2605
02:01:10,091 --> 02:01:11,860
the middle of the city and the in the
heat,

2606
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:15,970
like a whatever fuse he blew.
But before that,

2607
02:01:16,270 --> 02:01:21,130
that fucking guy would go onstage with a
leather jumpsuit on and just destroyed.

2608
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:24,310
I mean destroy in a level that people
don't appreciate today.

2609
02:01:24,490 --> 02:01:26,070
People forgot about him.
Everything.

2610
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:28,060
Gary Owen.
Yes,

2611
02:01:28,570 --> 02:01:31,210
I was as hell.
It's a two in a set.

2612
02:01:31,211 --> 02:01:34,480
I was playing Bonnaroo and biff.
I wanted to go on the night before to

2613
02:01:34,481 --> 02:01:38,650
warm up and I went to xannies and
Nashville and he's there and I hadn't

2614
02:01:38,651 --> 02:01:40,040
seen him before and I did

2615
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,710
a set and uh,
you know,

2616
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:43,910
it was okay.
It wasn't very good.

2617
02:01:43,911 --> 02:01:45,800
It was just fine.
And then he gets on.

2618
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:47,810
I don't,
I've never heard louder left.

2619
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:49,670
I've never heard louder last me and my
manager,

2620
02:01:49,671 --> 02:01:52,310
Jimmy Miller sat in the back of the room
and we were like,

2621
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:54,890
what is happening?
And then we start really paying

2622
02:01:54,891 --> 02:01:57,230
attention going,
how funny is this guy?

2623
02:01:57,231 --> 02:01:59,000
Like,
like listening to the material?

2624
02:01:59,001 --> 02:02:01,670
Like is this good material or is he
pandering or what is it?

2625
02:02:01,671 --> 02:02:02,810
Then we're like,
wait a second,

2626
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:05,090
here's the materials.
Incredible.

2627
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:09,500
Like he is awesome.
And it was the biggest labs I've ever

2628
02:02:09,501 --> 02:02:13,250
heard.
He had a sustained like killing the

2629
02:02:13,251 --> 02:02:13,971
crowd,
you know,

2630
02:02:13,971 --> 02:02:16,520
where the place is just rocking and
moving up and down.

2631
02:02:16,530 --> 02:02:17,860
It's just a lot of black shows,
right?

2632
02:02:17,861 --> 02:02:19,370
Yes.
And uh,

2633
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:24,350
he went full 20,
25 minutes at 10 before he slowed it

2634
02:02:24,351 --> 02:02:27,650
down and had to slow it down and he was
going to kill these people.

2635
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:30,800
And I swear I thought,
I don't know if I'm in the same

2636
02:02:30,801 --> 02:02:32,570
businesses,
this guy like,

2637
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:35,090
is this what we're supposed to do?
Well when you,

2638
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:39,290
when you jumped back into it,
you thought that three years ago you're

2639
02:02:39,291 --> 02:02:41,810
just going to have some fun and go and
do it.

2640
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:45,290
When was it that you realize like I am a
comic now,

2641
02:02:45,610 --> 02:02:50,120
I've got a kind of like really aspire to
a high standard,

2642
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:52,130
like I have to really tighten everything
up.

2643
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:53,480
I think,
um,

2644
02:02:53,570 --> 02:02:54,290
you know,
I would,

2645
02:02:54,290 --> 02:02:59,120
I was watching Louie work on his new set
very seriously at the comedy cellar and

2646
02:02:59,121 --> 02:02:59,601
he'd say,
yeah,

2647
02:02:59,601 --> 02:03:01,850
I got nothing.
I got nothing tonight and go onstage and

2648
02:03:01,851 --> 02:03:06,851
just crush.
And then I played Carnegie Hall and I

2649
02:03:06,861 --> 02:03:09,020
had a good set for the New York comedy
festival.

2650
02:03:09,021 --> 02:03:13,130
And then as a surprise,
I brought sandler out to do a surprise

2651
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:17,270
set after me and I thought I did great.

2652
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:22,600
And then when he came out the,
the laughter went up 20% where I felt it

2653
02:03:22,750 --> 02:03:23,510
like,
oh,

2654
02:03:23,510 --> 02:03:26,810
I'm like at a seven and he's at a nine
and a half.

2655
02:03:27,110 --> 02:03:30,470
Like it was a diff,
the sound changed and I thought,

2656
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:33,590
oh,
there's a whole nother step here that I

2657
02:03:33,591 --> 02:03:36,680
need to kick into gear.
I always want the material to be good,

2658
02:03:37,070 --> 02:03:38,480
but that,
oh,

2659
02:03:39,530 --> 02:03:43,130
there's a a way to crush that's hard to
do,

2660
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:47,450
to get that momentum and have the ideas.
And obviously Chris Rock is one of the

2661
02:03:47,451 --> 02:03:50,570
best of everybody at it because he has
so many great ideas,

2662
02:03:50,990 --> 02:03:55,990
but understands how to get the room rock
and really hard.

2663
02:03:56,091 --> 02:03:59,350
The cadence and the peace and the,
and to find what,

2664
02:03:59,351 --> 02:04:03,860
what is in your cadence that does it,
that doesn't become obnoxious or loud or

2665
02:04:04,030 --> 02:04:04,800
just,
you know,

2666
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:09,440
just talking fast.
Like how do you find an original way to

2667
02:04:09,441 --> 02:04:11,000
create that energy in a room?

2668
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:13,430
I think the only way it's constant
repetition.

2669
02:04:13,431 --> 02:04:15,690
You have to be on stage all the time.
Yeah.

2670
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:19,220
And you have to really always be trying
to improve it and you have to always be

2671
02:04:19,221 --> 02:04:21,110
listening to your recordings and you
have to have,

2672
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:24,370
and you've got to listen to bad sets.
Two sets go bad.

2673
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:26,160
You got to go,
why didn't that go back?

2674
02:04:26,161 --> 02:04:28,970
And let's listen to this fucking thing.
I always hear myself mumble like,

2675
02:04:28,971 --> 02:04:30,230
oh,
they didn't even hear what I said.

2676
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:32,960
That's big.
I got to stumble.

2677
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:33,820
Well,
I gotta get Outta here.

2678
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:35,840
I gotta go pick up a child.
Oh,

2679
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:37,680
I'm going to do my end of the show.
Plage he'll drink.

2680
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:38,040
I got

2681
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,020
the big sick.
Get a website,

2682
02:04:40,021 --> 02:04:40,760
dude.
Okay.

2683
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:44,190
I squarespace website.
So you're saying there's a place called

2684
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:48,450
squarespace that has websites.
I've heard about this can make your own

2685
02:04:48,451 --> 02:04:49,111
website.
Okay.

2686
02:04:49,111 --> 02:04:54,111
I'm at the Wilbur on the 24th in Boston.
July 24th 23rd richfield play house in

2687
02:04:54,241 --> 02:04:57,780
Connecticut and the 25th canceling
Canetti Columbus Theater.

2688
02:04:57,781 --> 02:04:58,620
Providence,
Rhode Island,

2689
02:04:59,130 --> 02:04:59,970
Connecticut.
Higgs.

2690
02:05:00,140 --> 02:05:01,560
Why is that?
I always do,

2691
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:03,300
which is for the hat of the work in
Connecticut.

2692
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:06,330
I'm not kidding.
It's not a real estate.

2693
02:05:06,510 --> 02:05:07,470
Okay,
I'm going to die.

2694
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:10,500
I'm going to figure that out to highway
between Boston and New York.

2695
02:05:10,501 --> 02:05:11,970
I'm gonna let you know if that's true.
Don't do it.

2696
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,130
But as of now,
talk later after that you're like,

2697
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:16,260
oh my God,
you were so right that Connecticut Gig

2698
02:05:16,261 --> 02:05:18,300
was horrible.
I need Connecticut people to show me

2699
02:05:18,301 --> 02:05:20,190
he's wrong.
All these Connecticut people are mad at

2700
02:05:20,191 --> 02:05:21,690
me now.
I get emails from connect it,

2701

How about Leo Fucking Connecticut?

2702
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:26,970
How about drive to Boston or drive from
New York and recognize the fuck you

2703
02:05:26,971 --> 02:05:29,700
