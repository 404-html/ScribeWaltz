1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,610
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,110
It's like Joe said earlier,

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:03,711
it's,

4
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:04,544
you know,

5
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,500
for some people they
can't handle this shit,

6
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:06,801
right?

7
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:07,100
Yeah.

8
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,270
It needs to be a driver's test for it.

9
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:08,780
You know what I mean?

10
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,081
Yeah.

11
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:10,520
There should be a driver's test for pot.

12
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,300
That's a good call.

13
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,070
Everybody handles their shit.

14
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,560
Sit.

15
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,540
A driver's stands for pod is actually

16
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,543
very good.

17
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,080
Just get you really stoned and you have
to listen to some like grateful dead and

18
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:23,890
then get you released stone and listened
to some punk getting them and get

19
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,600
really stoned and mixes
it with some alcohol.

20
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:25,850
You know,

21
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,110
there's like all these tests that you
have to do and then you get graded on each

22
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:29,441
line.

23
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:29,681
Like,

24
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:30,101
okay,

25
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:32,800
you can get stoned with
everyone except women.

26
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:33,843
You know,

27
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,240
you,

28
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,540
you,

29
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,720
we put you with three women and you
totally just started coming their hair and

30
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:38,710
then you started hitting him.

31
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,600
So

32
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,250
yeah,

33
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:40,730
yeah,

34
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,200
yeah.

35
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,220
It should be some,

36
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,270
some evaluation,

37
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,640
but then it'd be by who the government,

38
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:47,770
the government's going to be able to
step in and tell you what you just get,

39
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:48,940
like the boy scouts or something.

40
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:51,840
We should do.

41
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,040
At a campaign was to make the regulation,

42
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,783
the Internet,

43
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,030
you should have to write a blog and the
internet could decide whether or not

44
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:01,864
you're a Douche,

45
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,590
you know,

46
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,980
just tell us about yourself.

47
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,390
Tell us about yourself.

48
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:07,751
Well,

49
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:08,470
you know,

50
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,850
I'm fucking pretty awesome,

51
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,670
but actually I'm the best at
everything I do like totally fucking,

52
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:15,504
oh yeah,

53
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,900
you can't get weed.

54
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,100
You can't handle this shit.

55
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,230
Eat a few yoga classes for our son.

56
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:20,600
No,

57
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,041
I've,

58
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,510
I've seen people totally freak out.

59
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:24,400
There was one time that when like when,

60
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,230
when the Kush first came
around in 1995 right?

61
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,140
I was one of the first people with it
here in Cali and the Kush is just the,

62
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:32,361
oh,

63
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:37,361
super strong Oji Kush is obviously
one of the strongest deep Endeca,

64
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,890
deep indigo to me it's the strongest
I've smoked out of the shit that was

65
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:42,220
strong.

66
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,050
But that one after smoking it
for like maybe since 95 til now,

67
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,020
it's still gets me high as fuck.

68
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,100
Okay.

69
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,430
No,

70
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,240
I can't say that for any other herb.

71
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,600
I get smoke shit,

72
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:56,710
loads of herbs all day.

73
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:58,390
But when we first got that,

74
00:01:58,391 --> 00:02:00,580
so like we were the only
ones with it at the time,

75
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:00,821
you know,

76
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,590
it was like a small circle of guys and,

77
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:03,161
and uh,

78
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:04,030
we were on tour,

79
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,470
went to Michigan,

80
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:06,400
right in Michigan,

81
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:07,780
had some good herb,

82
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:08,370
you know what I mean?

83
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,810
That's some nice green,

84
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,780
smelly shit.

85
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,010
And uh,

86
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,550
we were backstage chilling and uh,

87
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,431
one of my friends,

88
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:15,671
you know,

89
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,370
he had a group of girls that
he knew out there and shit.

90
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,263
And um,

91
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,411
they come back,

92
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:21,130
hey,

93
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,660
so you're Cypress Hill,

94
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:23,494
Huh?

95
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,550
Where's all weed at?

96
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:25,384
I don't smoke note.

97
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,200
Don't smell no weed in here.

98
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:27,271
Yeah,

99
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:29,710
I heard you guys are the
weed kings and all that.

100
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,160
And I'm like,

101
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,701
Oh shit,

102
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:31,534
here we go.

103
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,590
And a,

104
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,720
I bet you don't got no
better weed than me.

105
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,183
We're like,

106
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:36,881
all right,

107
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:38,500
well we'll smoke some
of our shit with you,

108
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:39,070
but look,

109
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,390
if,

110
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,660
if we smoke our shit,

111
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,890
all jokes aside,

112
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,060
just hit it slow.

113
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:44,381
Don't,

114
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:47,720
don't hit it hard because this
shit is really strong and,

115
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:49,570
and I know you're talking all that shit,

116
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:50,681
but just,

117
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:51,071
you know,

118
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:51,904
just,

119
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,860
I just trust me,

120
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:55,240
don't hit this too hard.

121
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:55,511
Right.

122
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:56,344
She goes,

123
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,210
I probably smoked better weed than you.

124
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,873
Oh,

125
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,600
okay.

126
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,380
This was like in 1997 he always wants
to pretend they have the best weed.

127
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,151
Why is that?

128
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:08,400
And they always want to
brag to me that they do.

129
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,131
You know what I'm saying?

130
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:09,931
No one's ever like John,

131
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:10,840
my wheat is shit.

132
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,071
Oh Shit.

133
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:12,730
Weed man.

134
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,563
I got some whack.

135
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,130
Hi Dude,

136
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,150
I got some whack weed.

137
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,220
But you ever smoke by shit mark all day.

138
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,060
And I'm barely high.

139
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,180
But I only say that when I know
the other person has better weed.

140
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:22,750
I don't want to go,

141
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,261
oh no.

142
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:24,340
Cause I want to smoke your weed.

143
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:24,940
You know?

144
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,990
So she says to you,

145
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,140
we absolutely better.

146
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,000
We probably,

147
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,040
I probably smoked better weed than you.

148
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:30,341
Right.

149
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:32,650
So I'm like more preposterous statement.

150
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,410
Yeah.

151
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:33,850
I mean,

152
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,240
I,

153
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,780
you know,

154
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,650
I've never seen a picture of you that
a pot leaf next to you somewhere,

155
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,270
you know,

156
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,420
so she was openly testing me,

157
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:40,691
right.

158
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:41,820
So I said,

159
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:42,191
okay,

160
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,380
let's roll one up then.

161
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,190
Right?

162
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,630
So we wrote one up and just
like I told her not to do,

163
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:50,700
she takes off fucking huge hit.

164
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:51,780
Like trying to show off.

165
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,653
So you know,

166
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,880
I know the super exaggerated on the,

167
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,360
let me prove how big of a stoner I am.

168
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,140
Hit right,

169
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,150
wrong move wrong.

170
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,921
Fuck it moved.

171
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:06,921
She starts coughing up blogs is shit
head spinning and like within five to 10

172
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:09,371
minutes she was like,

173
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,450
what did you guys put it this week?

174
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,500
I've never felt this before.

175
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,620
What did you pick guys with
this guy that she was laced?

176
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,660
I'd never smoked nothing like
this had been smoking alone.

177
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:18,821
I'm like,

178
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:19,271
see,

179
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:20,104
I told you,

180
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,840
I said we hit the shit too.

181
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,681
I mean,

182
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,300
you don't see us freaking out.

183
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:25,571
You know,

184
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:27,610
there was nothing that
you watched me roll it.

185
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:29,200
I told you not to hit it hard.

186
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:29,780
I said,

187
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,100
Yo,

188
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,300
you better take this bitch home.

189
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,011
You know what,

190
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:34,510
get your friend and take her home.

191
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:35,650
She can't handle her shit.

192
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,843
Oh,

193
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,350
have you ever felt that though at all?

194
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,610
Have you ever smoked
something where you're like,

195
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,421
this shit was late.

196
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:42,140
This was like embalming fluid or

197
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,680
story like that.

198
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,210
But I didn't freak out like that.

199
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,161
It was,

200
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:53,020
we had just filmed this video for Latin
lingo off of our first album and I

201
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,400
hadn't smoked all day.

202
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,440
My homie that lived in Long Beach,

203
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,011
you know,

204
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:57,431
he was like,

205
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:57,641
yeah,

206
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,301
come up bro.

207
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,770
We're fucking blazing right now.

208
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:00,220
You know?

209
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,230
And it was about 10 11 Clark,

210
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,153
whatever.

211
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,200
So I had all the way out to long beach
and he hands me a bullet to circle a

212
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,990
guy's fucking room is just smoked out.

213
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:11,891
I'm like,

214
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,281
okay,

215
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:13,114
well fuck it though.

216
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,370
It's not going to take
on to get high here.

217
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,800
So he gives me this three foot bong,

218
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,401
you know,

219
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,480
one of those graphics,

220
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:20,090
one's memory,

221
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,420
the old graphics acrylics with the,

222
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,980
like the tin bottom and shit.

223
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,390
So he gives me one of those.

224
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,650
I take a hit filling.

225
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,430
Cool.

226
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,820
Right?

227
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,290
It goes around the circle,

228
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,310
comes back to me,

229
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:30,910
boom.

230
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,743
I hit another one,

231
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,360
third comes back a third time.

232
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,980
So after the third time I'm like
feeling extra high and I've like,

233
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,530
that's usually nothing to me.

234
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:41,951
I was like,

235
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:42,784
what the fuck?

236
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,500
Why am I feeling,

237
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,530
I'm like starting to feel
closed in claustrophobic.

238
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:47,891
I'm like,

239
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:48,521
what the fuck?

240
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:50,300
I'm like fucking hot in here.

241
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,820
Could you open the window bro?

242
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:53,680
I'm fucking die.

243
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,351
Can't breathe.

244
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:55,184
Right.

245
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,791
And then I do.

246
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,601
Why are you freaking out?

247
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:56,871
I said,

248
00:05:56,871 --> 00:05:57,561
I know man.

249
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:58,490
I'm high right now.

250
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,324
He goes,

251
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,051
oh,

252
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:02,810
it must be the Hash we put
on the bottom on the ball.

253
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,330
Oh yeah,

254
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:05,901
exactly.

255
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,850
I didn't know there was hash
on the bottom of the bowl,

256
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:10,160
but I was freaking out at
first because I'm like,

257
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:10,994
man,

258
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,770
I've smoked this weed before.

259
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,800
Why am I so tripping off
at three fucking bowls?

260
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,634
I had to leave.

261
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,270
I'm like,

262
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,961
all right guys,

263
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,070
I got to go and mess.

264
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,140
And ash is a very odd,

265
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:21,974
hi,

266
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,813
it's heavy.

267
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,950
That's heavy.

268
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,470
Yeah,

269
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,860
I definitely wasn't
cause it's super cousin.

270
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:28,610
The marijuana.

271
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:28,790
Yeah.

272
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,790
Nobody went out of their way to tell
me till after I took all three bowls,

273
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:34,941
you know,

274
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:35,774
like a champ,

275
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,141
you know,

276
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:40,760
cause I was a bong hit and
motherfucker back then and uh,

277
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,510
man,

278
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,350
June dude,

279
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:44,540
after like 15 minutes I was just like,

280
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:44,961
man,

281
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:47,870
I'm feeling crispy is going on.

282
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,420
This usually is just a warmup.

283
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,501
Yeah.

284
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,960
I took a cookie once on
a plane and it was a,

285
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,380
every now and then you'd get
a cookie that just blows.

286
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,260
It blows your head.

287
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,391
Yeah.

288
00:06:58,391 --> 00:07:02,750
And Mine and I took it before I got on
board and so I figured I always time it

289
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:04,100
fucking an hour and 20 minutes.

290
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,110
That's usually what it takes right before
you're just not moving wherever you

291
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:10,100
are is where you stay.

292
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,380
I got on board,

293
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,730
got in just in time,

294
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,170
but the plane takes off,

295
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,080
I strap in,

296
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,150
I pull back,

297
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:17,421
click,

298
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:18,410
click on the seat.

299
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,070
Right.

300
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,230
And just go into orbit.

301
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,000
Eyes closed.

302
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,570
I'm watching like neon cartoons,

303
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,520
fuck in front of my eyeballs,

304
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,540
literally seeing hallucinations and I'm
feeling my body flying through the air

305
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,360
going for a hundred miles an hour.

306
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:43,361
I'm like super hyper aware that I'm in
this metal tube hurling through the sky

307
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,340
back in my chair while this is going on.

308
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:48,681
I'm going,

309
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:49,730
fuck,

310
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,060
this is crazy and I'm hallucinating at
the same time and seeing crazy things and

311
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,933
you'll you'll,

312
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,960
you'll take cookies and
you'll be convinced it's over.

313
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,560
Oh yeah,

314
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:00,861
it does.

315
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:01,540
This is it.

316
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:01,850
Look,

317
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,260
I can't survive this.

318
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,700
The cookies are misleading.

319
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,430
The cookies are misleading because cute.

320
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,170
Yeah,

321
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,010
they taste so fucking good you like,

322
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,630
and then they don't hit you right away.

323
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:11,991
So you're like,

324
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,110
oh,

325
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,040
maybe I got an email.

326
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,080
And then before you know it,

327
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:18,980
you're like three in and
fucking toasted beyond belief.

328
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,200
I know I've said this a hundred
times in the podcast before,

329
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,240
but I just have to say it
in the interest of that.

330
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,620
Somebody might not know this.

331
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,940
If you eat it,

332
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,660
it's a totally different with different
high because your brain or your body

333
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:32,150
produces something called
11 hydroxy metabolite.

334
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:32,690
It's by,

335
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,411
by eating it,

336
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:36,680
it gets processed by your liver and
it's like four to five times more

337
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,240
psychoactive than THC.

338
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,070
So that's the real issue with it.

339
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:40,380
And saying,

340
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,120
this is not,

341
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,990
no one educates anybody about this.

342
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,673
You just,

343
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,410
you just think it's,

344
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:45,591
oh,

345
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,520
this is strong.

346
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,690
It's not just strong.

347
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,410
Something you've never experienced before
that if you do too much you'll freak

348
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:51,571
out.

349
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:51,650
Yeah.

350
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,670
It's a psychedelic.

351
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,060
Yeah,

352
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,450
it can.

353
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:53,691
Yeah,

354
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:54,171
for sure.

355
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:56,160
If you have enough of it for sure.

356
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,560
You could definitely have one of
those freak outs where you're like,

357
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,423
I want it to end.

358
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,303
I want it to end.

359
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,220
And the thing is you cannot make it in.

360
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:03,780
You got to ride it all the way.

361
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:04,740
The fuck out dude.

362
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,860
My friend Eddie Bravo had one where
he was crying and thinking about his

363
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:13,830
grandmother and going through
some crazy shit about this.

364
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,020
He had created some character,

365
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,100
like it was like a,

366
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,110
a a white guy who wanted to be a black
rapper so bad he put black makeup on.

367
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,920
He was like literally putting black
face on and he was saying that he had

368
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,090
vitiligo that it's,

369
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:27,241
you know,

370
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:28,590
he's just trying to even as skin out,

371
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,211
but,

372
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:34,860
and we buddied got so high for meeting
this Brownie that he was so sorry that he

373
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:35,670
made it.

374
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,121
And he was like,

375
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:36,860
man,

376
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,100
people are gonna Misunderstand.

377
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:39,030
They're going to hate me.

378
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,860
They're going to think I'm
making fun of black people.

379
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:41,694
What did I do?

380
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,530
Like he was terrified.

381
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,380
It was like he had gone
to the grips of sanity.

382
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:46,800
Yeah.

383
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,790
And then in the morning,

384
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,001
you know,

385
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:48,540
he was fine.

386
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:48,720
He,

387
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:48,931
yeah,

388
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:49,760
he's totally,

389
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,011
yeah.

390
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:50,880
Back Down to Earth,

391
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,240
man.

392
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,880
That shit fucking paranoid.

393
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,601
Yeah.

394
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:54,840
When,

395
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,050
when you get super fucking
highlight that off of,

396
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,441
you know,

397
00:09:58,441 --> 00:09:59,274
an edible,

398
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,271
I mean,

399
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,000
you get you,

400
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,440
you know,

401
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,060
either you have a great time,

402
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,380
you know what I mean?

403
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:04,621
And,

404
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:04,921
and,

405
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:06,300
and you know,

406
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,140
you relish it.

407
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:07,561
It's like,

408
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:07,981
yes,

409
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:09,390
this was the fucking perfect,

410
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,040
perfect amount to have.

411
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,040
Or you're that guy like I,

412
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,471
you know,

413
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:14,130
like I said,

414
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,540
I wanted to add right now,

415
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,370
but you can't be half to ride it out.

416
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:18,430
And then you have to ride after,

417
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,290
ride it out and just
always remember to breathe.

418
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,560
[inaudible]

419
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,440
you're a fucking human being.
