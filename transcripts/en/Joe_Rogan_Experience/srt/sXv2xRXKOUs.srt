1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,070
Her low freak bitches will probably have
a following of Irish people to,

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,690
you know what I mean?
Who Cares?

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,310
Who gives a fuck?
Speaking of the Irish speaking,

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,290
I've got them right here.
Oh Man.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,213
Hey listen,
man,

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,460
this guy has balls.
This is why I respect the fuck out of

7
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,500
conor Mcgregor.
Not just because he's an awesome fighter

8
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:21,750
and yeah,
he lost the Nate Diaz who's also an

9
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:25,930
awesome fighter,
but who the fuck will fight anybody who

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,160
will just jump up?
The light goes,

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,470
Bj.
Bj tried it and you know what?

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,080
Even though a Bj didn't,
he had success once,

13
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:35,700
at least at one 70 he beat mad.
He's,

14
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:40,701
but at the end of the day,
there's a really good reason why all

15
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:43,080
elite boxers,
wrestlers,

16
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:47,340
fighters,
weight cutting is so massively

17
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:49,950
important.
Virtually everybody,

18
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:53,070
there are some crazy people out there
like Anthony Johnson.

19
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,790
That's the exception,
but generally there's a really good

20
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,720
reason most people are torturing
themselves to get as light as possible

21
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:05,010
because at the elite level,
five pounds makes a big fucking

22
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:05,670
difference.

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,440
It makes a big difference.
Just five pounds,

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,920
10 pounds,
10 pound different elite level men.

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,490
Even the best guys aren't going up
looking at half a Mendez.

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,260
No doubt.
Probably pound for pound.

27
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:19,680
The best guy in Jujitsu,
probably him and Marcello,

28
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,251
John,
Jack,

29
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:21,510
they're all up there.
Pam,

30
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,370
pound for pound.
There's so many good guys now.

31
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,450
Jesus.
It's incredible now.

32
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,370
You know what I mean?
Uh,

33
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,310
you know,
even Marcello Nolan's trying to go up in

34
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:30,510
weight.
No one's trying to go,

35
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:33,480
let me do this year.
I'm going to try the weight category

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,020
above me.
Know everybody's on the craziest died.

37
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,170
They need three months.
They get serious about it.

38
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,490
They're on instagram posts in their
fucking broccoli every day with chicken.

39
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:47,320
Fucking selfies of their,
of their hubs and shit.

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,420
You know it,
they're killing themselves because not

41
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:53,940
because it feels good.
It feels like shit.

42
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,150
They all love eating it.
It's so important.

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,060
Uh,
so everybody knows you just can't go up

44
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:02,250
and goddamn white.
Bj was,

45
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:04,470
Bj was the one that said,
fuck it.

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,330
He went up to light heavyweight and
shit.

47
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,490
Chino,
five foot eight.

48
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:10,770
No,
it wasn't even light heavyweight,

49
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:11,790
Bro.
It was heavyweight.

50
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,890
Because Leo Machida was like two Oh
eight.

51
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,160
Okay.
Okay.

52
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,410
I think that fight was like technically
a heavyweight fight.

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,810
Find that out.
But with

54
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,270
Cheetah,
you know what I mean?

55
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,930
He was fat for shorter.
That's out of shame.

56
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:31,280
And did you ever see when he used to
fight kickboxing fat,

57
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,770
his first UFC fight,
that's not his real weight has real

58
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:37,650
weight is two oh five one and 485.
So,

59
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,430
uh,
but Bj did it and I always admired him.

60
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:43,350
I,
I to me animal to me,

61
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,720
I looked,
I'll always look at,

62
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:47,070
Bj has a living legend.

63
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,083
Yeah,
the guy didn't,

64
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,940
he's not undefeated.
He got his ass beat a few times.

65
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,650
Who gives a fuck look would be jay did,
he had the balls to step up and really

66
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:59,750
he was a 45 or just like just a car the
whole time he was a foreigner and

67
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,360
Jujitsu.
He was a 45 or,

68
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:04,090
yeah,
he was always a 45 or fighting at 55

69
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,470
bod.
I won 70.

70
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,090
Nobody else is doing it.
And you know,

71
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:08,440
Connor,
here he comes.

72
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,980
Connor,
this guy,

73
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,540
uh,
um,

74
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,650
he has so much power in his hands.
He had that courage to think he could

75
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,110
finish what Bj started,
you know,

76
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:22,570
let me go up there and do that.
Do what Bj did.

77
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,090
But you know,
he felt like he could fucking knock

78
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:26,650
anybody out.
He really,

79
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:29,690
really believed he could fucking,
he will be lands.

80
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:31,030
You're going down and you know what?

81
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,120
He was doing great against Nate Diaz.
I ma,

82
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,500
this is my,
this is my,

83
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,870
this is how I found out.
Okay.

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,010
I'm Juan.
I'm at,

85
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,860
I'm at this party,
slam his house and uh,

86
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,300
I didn't realize we were behind by a
minute and a half that we rely,

87
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,440
oh,
I thought we were alive,

88
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:53,020
but we were behind by a man and
everyone's going nuts.

89
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,430
I'm watching going,
oh shit.

90
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,170
Lizzie borden is sitting next to me.
My childhood idol.

91
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,640
He's one of my greatest,
favorite lead singers of all time.

92
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,550
We sit next to him or watching
everyone's going nuts.

93
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,890
It looks like Connor's to me.
I was like,

94
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,780
Connor's gonna win this thing,
man.

95
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,160
He was lightened,
made up,

96
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,380
cutting them all up.
He was connecting.

97
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:15,310
He looked really confident like car look
call that whole first round I was gone.

98
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,750
It's,
it's uh,

99
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,390
it,
it was over in the forced second stock

100
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,233
and there was a second.

101
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,450
So in that round I get a call from Joey,
Joey's,

102
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:25,511
I go,
oh,

103
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:28,930
you know how much I want.
You know how much I told you?

104
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,120
I told you,
you never bet against Diaz.

105
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,260
I go,
what are you talking about?

106
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,360
I thought it was watching it.
Are you talking about the Meesha fight?

107
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,321
He goes,
no,

108
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:36,970
motherfucker,
you got choke.

109
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,280
Like who got choked up a call?
The home got choked out.

110
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,740
I'm watching the date and he has no
motherfucker.

111
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,490
What thought are you watching right now?
I'm watching the quarter pipe as it's

112
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:46,870
going on.
He goes,

113
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,820
he choked him fucking out.
I'm like,

114
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,560
dude,
fuck.

115
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,440
And he goes by boom.
He realized he fucked up.

116
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:57,700
And I'm like,
and I knew that Diaz was going to win a

117
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,380
minute.
You've wasn't to pee or something.

118
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,950
We were at a party and it was just
behind someone rewound wound shit.

119
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,870
Rewind.
Should you want to see something again?

120
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,470
And you didn't fast forward it.
So we thought it was live.

121
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,370
So Joey,
Joey called me hysterical and he gave it

122
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,830
away.
And then once he realized he gave it

123
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,820
away,
he hung up because Oh shit.

124
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,870
And I said,
Oh shit by you just fucked up the

125
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:23,710
greatest fight ever.
But the fight was so crazy and so

126
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:28,540
fucking insane that even though I knew,
even though I knew,

127
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,620
I go,
okay,

128
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,440
somehow nate is going to take him down
and choke him out,

129
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,900
but it doesn't look good right here.
I'm like,

130
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,720
how is he going to take an connor down?
That's not going to be easy.

131
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,220
Fuck,
he's going to pull this off.

132
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:42,430
How is he going to do it?
Had no idea that nate,

133
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,240
nate hurts connor.
Connor takes him down.

134
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,860
You know?
That's how it went down.

135
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,370
The place I was at was going fucking
nuts.

136
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,410
Everybody was screaming at the top of
the fucking logs.

137
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:58,370
Every everyone's,
and then when he choked him out,

138
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,580
dude,
I never been in a party where everyone

139
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:06,581
was going so crazy before everybody was
losing their fucking mind.

140
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:11,801
I was too holy shit blinds.
Everybody was going crazy.

141
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,060
Oh Man.
Jumped up and screamed.

142
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,940
I almost had an,
I never screamed so loud in my

143
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:21,800
motherfucking life at any fight ever.
That was shocking.

144
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,530
It was the same.
It looked like Carla was just had his

145
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,420
hands down cause I got this
motherfucker,

146
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,130
he was landon,
he was tagging him.

147
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:29,720
It looked like you heard him a couple of
times.

148
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,670
He definitely tag them.
You know what I mean?

149
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:32,910
It looked,
he was,

150
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,390
I thought it was uh,
it was over for nate.

151
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:38,630
I really did.
And when he turned it around and the way

152
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,920
it finished and when he put that fucking
rear naked choke and he put that

153
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:46,490
motherfucker and like a Super Ninja,
the weight,

154
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:47,810
first of all,
the way he mounted,

155
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,650
if you don't do Jujitsu,
you would never know the way he fucking

156
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,350
mounted and his balance.

157
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,460
You could see the balance.
You could see the beauty in that mound

158
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,840
and the way he was riding him,
like a professional fucking a champion

159
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:04,280
Rodeo.
Fucking reiner,

160
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,730
all is balanced is all beautiful.
And then when he took his back,

161
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,630
the way he put that fucking Hook in
there was,

162
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,510
it was so efficient.
There wasn't no hiccup where he hit the,

163
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,530
you know,
uh,

164
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,920
this jaw and then he had to set up and
then you got to feel,

165
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,980
it just went,
it was fucking insanity.

166
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,120
So perfect.
And so fucking like that technique was

167
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,060
about is flawless and as beautiful as
you can get.

168
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,370
Yeah,
there was two big points was that we had

169
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:39,020
never seen conor face adversity and we
had never seen him on the ground with a

170
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,240
real Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.
Like nate.

171
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,940
Nate's got a nasty ground game man.
His ground now.

172
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,330
You know what,
people are talking in a lot of shit on

173
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:48,164
Congress.
Jujitsu.

174
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,100
I know Connor's digits is good.
He's come to my school.

175
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,910
That guys good just cause he got
mountain.

176
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,960
Yeah,
he was already here.

177
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,260
But even if he wasn't her,
I get mounted by my purple belt

178
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:03,470
sometimes and I get my bag.
There's some shit going on and add

179
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:06,890
punches and fucking all this height.
Just cause he got mountain and got his

180
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:10,040
back taking does not mean connor's
Jujitsu sucks.

181
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,750
Don't get it twisted.
He was a little hurt.

182
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,770
Nate Diaz is really good.
Really,

183
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,570
really good.
You know what I mean?

184
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,250
Like Nate Diaz could probably do that to
me.

185
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,410
Doesn't mean I suck.
You know what I mean?

186
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,420
He could probably get my back.
Doesn't mean I suck.

187
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:25,010
I'm a high,
you know,

188
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:27,440
so.
Well he got hurt and it's real simple.

189
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,480
When you get tagged,
the way he got tagged and what you're

190
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:29,990
trying to take.

191
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,580
Nate Diaz down,
he got hurt.

192
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,000
He probably had no idea what the fuck he
was doing.

193
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,750
You know,
I haven't had an MMA fight,

194
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:40,040
but sean was telling me about when
Travis Brown hit him and that he was

195
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:40,491
like,
dude,

196
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:42,680
I know how to get out of the mountain.
But when travis hit me,

197
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:44,390
he's like,
I didn't know what I was doing.

198
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,530
He was,
I was out of it.

199
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,950
I think that we mustn't get punched in
the face.

200
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,120
You can't judge his Jujitsu.
It's like judging is walking.

201
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:55,740
If you get head kicked connor,
she jitsu good.

202
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,610
Nate Diaz.

203
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,710
Jujitsu is just way better.
You know what I'm saying?

204
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,960
If that's all it is,
sunny punches you in the face and then

205
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:01,980
you walk funny like,
man,

206
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:03,720
you need to work on your walking.
No,

207
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,090
they got memes of connor like it like
him in like a kids Jiu Jitsu class and

208
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,370
they put it in place.
That's one that's going around.

209
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,740
I think that's hurt.
You know what he's heard?

210
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:15,030
He is good.
Trust me,

211
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,130
connors.
Jujitsu is very,

212
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,840
very standard to Ross.
To me,

213
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,570
he's not a joke,
especially in that first round was nasty

214
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,660
standup look very good.
And he's just a look.

215
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,570
First of all is Nate Diaz is not a real
one.

216
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:30,870
70 all they did fight one 70 twice.
He fought us.

217
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,900
Dungan Kim and the fobt,
uh,

218
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,040
rory.
Rory Macdonald,

219
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,530
remember that?
Fought those guys at one 70 so he did

220
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:41,790
have two fights at one 70 but he's a one
55 or he's a big one.

221
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,720
55 or he's big and long.
I don't know if he could ever make one

222
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:49,620
45 I just don't think he could do it.
Connor barely can do it.

223
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,420
You know,
connor barely can do it.

224
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,420
When you see conor at the weigh ins,
I mean those photos from the winds are

225
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:57,960
pretty legendary.
I think it's insane that we do this,

226
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,330
that we let these guys dehydrate
themselves like that.

227
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:04,200
I think whatever nate walks around that
that's what he should fight at.

228
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:07,680
And I don't know if connor really walks
around at one 68 which what he weighed

229
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:10,410
in and nate raid one 69 they're only one
pound different.

230
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,110
And Nate,
you know nate had some body fat on him

231
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,210
cause he wasn't,
it wasn't preparing for this at all.

232
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,530
I think connor,
I think connor could make some noise at

233
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:22,020
one 55 shrink down.
I'm sure you see the two of those

234
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:22,910
together.
Can we do it?

235
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,990
Look at,
look at the difference between how he

236
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,750
weighed in before and how we wait in
this time.

237
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,980
I mean,
my God,

238
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,930
he looks like he has some fucking crazy
disease that like won't let food absorb

239
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,320
in his body on the top one,
you know like he's got some crazy

240
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:42,210
illness and then on the bottom he looks
great full faced.

241
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,660
But you know if he can make one 45 he's
going to continue to do it.

242
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,200
Can you think gets in the ring card?
Girls are like sitting right there.

243
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,780
Is that an accident is perfect for the
pictures.

244
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,240
That's why they stand their ultimate
man.

245
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,320
It's to balance out that dude in the
underwear.

246
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,870
That's exactly,
that's funny.

247
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,500
That's funny.
That's an accurate,

248
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,420
he could completely dominate.
Continue to dominate the one 45 division

249
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,610
and I think he could make a lot of epic
fights at one 55 five went beat some big

250
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:22,020
names but then lose to some other big
names.

251
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:26,160
Like he'll be one of the top guys at 55
I don't know if he'll just clean house

252
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:30,810
like he did it 45 but I believe if he
stayed at 55 he would do some serious

253
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:32,460
damage.
He's a bad motherfucker.

254
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,910
Yeah,
he's a bad motherfucker.

255
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,210
Shit.

256
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,480
He's saying after the fight,
that perfect ship.

257
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,840
Perfect Shit.
I love what he's doing.

258
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,210
What?
I love how he's handling it.

259
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:42,180
I think he handled it.
His laws better than anybody ever,

260
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,800
ever.
He said on the right,

261
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,120
she'll in victory.
And I'm be humbling defeat.

262
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,230
No matter what happened in that fight,
his next fight,

263
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,600
whoever he's fighting,
he's going to get fucked up.

264
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,320
You know what I mean?
Mean.

265
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:55,150
What if you faced Los Angeles,
you know,

266
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,940
tough fight.
He's going to cut them up.

267
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,040
I bet he tags him a few times.
I bet you're right.

268
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,950
I bet he tags and I bet you're right.
You can tag everybody to hit some people

269
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,500
and just cause he got knocked out.
A lot of people,

270
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,730
half the people get knocked out and
fights.

271
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,260
He got knocked out,
he got,

272
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,690
he got cracked and you've got choked.
But um,

273
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,220
I'm interested in to see how he handles
the physicality of Dos Anjos who's a lot

274
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:16,960
more physical than nate.
You know,

275
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,450
dos Santos is a beast.
I wanna.

276
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,700
I wanna know if he could do to connor,
what he was able to do to nate,

277
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,670
but he was able to do to a lot of guys
like pettis.

278
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:25,570
What he did,
the Pedis,

279
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,290
you know that guy strong as shit,
but that was so bummed out when he broke

280
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,460
his foot.
I was like,

281
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:32,410
God,
that's a crazy fight and so it's going

282
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:33,580
to be there,
but fucking nate,

283
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,610
all of a sudden they

284
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,170
that little stoner is going to be,
he's probably sweet dude.

285
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:44,300
He's,
he's super famous now.

286
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,030
Everybody knows your name.
Come on dude.

287
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,810
Greatest all time.
Post fight line.

288
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,960
I got it today.
I'm not surprised motherfuckers.

289
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,243
No,
it's funny.

290
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,280
You know what dude?
In the beginning,

291
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,270
conor won the verbal that battles the
first couple press commerce.

292
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,420
He kinda did.
Connor came full blown and then nate,

293
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,890
nate one towards the end.
Dude,

294
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,900
I felt that nate was in connor's head.
I think it reversed at bay.

295
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,600
I think he was pissing connor off that
he kept saying,

296
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:16,810
fuck you.
He just went gangster on them.

297
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:19,180
Every time my crew will fuck up your
crew.

298
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,670
Like I said,
if you want to make this fucking serious

299
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,040
week,
we're going to pass by you guys

300
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,890
somewhere in this motherfucking hotel.
We'll jump.

301
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:29,470
You will do that.
You guys want to do it will actually

302
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,730
jump you guys and it'll be all over
fucking shirt done the shit.

303
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,080
You're Dana White.
What do you do

304
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,580
with Misha Dude?
Blower up.

305
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:42,490
She's huge.
Who Rages?

306
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,460
I don't know man,
but give her a world tour first.

307
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,200
She won one of the greatest victories in
the history of MMA.

308
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Damn down down on the scorecards in the
fourth round with two minutes to go.

309
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:58,690
She hits a takedown,
takes her back,

310
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,540
almost get shook over the top,
hangs on,

311
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,730
hangs on.
That was so dramatic.

312
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,250
That was like the end of the thought.
So smart.

313
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,280
She fought so smart.
She did everything that all the experts

314
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:13,780
were saying she was going to need to do.
She did everything she avoided and kicks

315
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,680
in Russian and she had to pull it off
like the,

316
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,970
what was that?
Our minute left.

317
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,210
Tell me how much dislike,
like somewhere around two minutes to go

318
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,980
when she went for the take down.
When she,

319
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,580
when she got ahold of her.
So you're down to last round.

320
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,320
Last round edge wasn't winning the
round.

321
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,780
Nothing really had happened.
That was like big and significant.

322
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,960
She had a take down 10,
probably lose it on the cards.

323
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,970
Crappy.
I didn't look at the cards,

324
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,400
but you know,
she won that one round for sure when she

325
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:41,530
took her down and that went,
made everybody go,

326
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,750
oh shit.
Is that the second?

327
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,470
Was it the second round that she took
her down?

328
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:48,190
This was dominating her?
Um,

329
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,510
yeah,
I think it was the second.

330
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,690
Her meesha is wrestling me.
Her wrestling is a lot better than

331
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,580
before.
Before she's hustling dude.

332
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:57,000
She hustled.
She keeps getting better.

333
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,510
Holly Holm and easy to take down.
Take down the fence.

334
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:01,370
That's like her main shit.
Um,

335
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,790
she probably works on her takedown
defense more than her Jujitsu.

336
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,900
So this is the cards.

337
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,833
Yeah.

338
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,260
So what does it say and basically what
are we doing here?

339
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,410
You should take this hard to do,
these are confusing.

340
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:14,821
White,
blue,

341
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:16,170
pink.
There's a pink card,

342
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,130
I guess the Oh,
the different people just as the

343
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:22,550
referee's names.
Um,

344
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,300
okay.
So round nine so ten nine well,

345
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,840
who's red and who's blew me?
She has blue blue on the left.

346
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,440
Oh,
okay.

347
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,340
So how,
yeah,

348
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:33,690
so it must've been the,
hmm.

349
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,390
That's interesting.
Wait,

350
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,433
wait a minute.

351
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,270
All three at ten nine for the first
right.

352
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,490
All three had ten eight for the second.
Right.

353
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:45,950
That makes sense.
And all three at ten nine for the third

354
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,220
and for the fourth.
So does that make it a draw?

355
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,840
No,
that means holly was ahead.

356
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,390
Well,
how do they judge the fourth and then

357
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:56,630
the fifth she was ahead in the fourth so
holly was ahead by one point,

358
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,590
right?
Yep.

359
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,290
Yep.
Even though she'd won three rounds.

360
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,480
Yes.
I mean ten eight if she would have won

361
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:03,440
that round,
it would have been a draw,

362
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:04,670
I guess.
Wow.

363
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,650
But she was,
she wasn't really winning on the round.

364
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,940
I'm surprised that they all gave him a
ten eight that's good.

365
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,200
That's very good.
Good.

366
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,240
Good job,
Bill.

367
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,710
Today their name's Marcos for solids.
Good job.

368
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,653
Yeah,
that was,

369
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,250
yeah,
that was a real ten eight that's how 10

370
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:20,720
h should look.
Someone takes it down,

371
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:21,554
beat the shit out of you.

372
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,500
But just what an what a finish.
That was.

373
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:27,450
What was amazing about it and you know
holly fought smart,

374
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:30,650
she used that side kick a lot.
She's so good with their movement.

375
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,870
She caught me should with a lot of
punches to man,

376
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,970
but she wasn't,
she wasn't going after her.

377
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,160
She would catch it with punches and stay
on the outside.

378
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,130
She was fighting a smart fight and she
got taken down.

379
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:43,310
She got dominated on the ground by
Meesha and that's when I was like wow.

380
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,250
Neesha's fucking top game is solid as a
rock.

381
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,110
Like our control is excellent and she's
fucking strong man.

382
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,770
She's strong cause holly's strong.
Holly Holm is strong.

383
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,730
I was really impressed with their ground
and pound really impressed with your top

384
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:00,560
game.
But then you know what man,

385
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:04,220
the next round Holly Holm got right back
on her fucking bicycle and,

386
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:07,820
and and probably in everyone's eyes and
when that round right,

387
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,640
all those judges eyes I was,
to me it was a,

388
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,730
if that would have wanted a decision
that would have given it to holly.

389
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,710
Yeah.
Just based on,

390
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,633
uh,
you know,

391
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,010
depending upon how that feel,
real damage.

392
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:21,560
She never knocked me shut down.
She never hurt me.

393
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:23,440
She right.
It was the shipper I heard,

394
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:25,640
never heard her.
She tagged her a couple times where,

395
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:27,350
you know,
she snapped her head back a little bit,

396
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:29,540
but it wasn't anything like was she
alone was wrong.

397
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,830
Yeah.
Legs giving out.

398
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,000
No.
So it,

399
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,140
it,
it was,

400
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,970
it was about to be a semi boring
decision overall.

401
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:39,160
Like who would want to watch that fight
again?

402
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,600
The second round was kind of cool.
It was going to be one of those fights,

403
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:44,870
but just like that me shit turned it
into one of the greatest fights ever.

404
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,760
Amazing.
Yeah.

405
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:50,250
And I come back that last second.
That's like a grand slam and the bottom

406
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:53,280
of the ninth in the scramble to get to
the back.

407
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,920
Her scramble,
the way she held on as Holly Hollywood

408
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:58,830
kept moving and changing and adjusting.
She kept holding on.

409
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:02,670
Then finally the Hail Mary Hollie tries
to flip her over the top and she hangs

410
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:07,020
on and hangs on to the choke and sinks
it in and gets the hooks in and,

411
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,080
and when holly goes to sleep,
punching in the air,

412
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,320
you know those,
you know those old nfl films,

413
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:18,060
like when you watch those at the super
bowl from 1978 or something and have

414
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:21,090
that voice in the toddler,
they're doing the slow mo and these all

415
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:22,620
these old,
you know,

416
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,880
memorable plays at epic plays in 20
years.

417
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:31,080
When they look back at that and they
have some old like Orson Welles type a

418
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:33,490
narrator talking about,
you know,

419
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:39,020
about going through all that transition
and there was a lot of drama going on

420
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:40,290
there,
man.

421
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,000
She didn't just take her back and choke
her.

422
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,040
There was a lot of shit.
There was a lot of shit to handle.

423
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,710
So much was going on.
And you gotta watch this happening.

424
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,960
Yeah,
it was incredible to rear naked choke.

425
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,780
The scramble scramble was just so epic
because the drama building up,

426
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,630
he,
she's down on the cards most likely you

427
00:18:57,631 --> 00:18:58,890
can't watch that.
Were watched.

428
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:00,160
No,
we can never watch does.

429
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,420
She's down in the cards.
Most likely she's about to,

430
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,810
she's about to lose a decision probably.
Oh my God.

431
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:08,340
She's got a hold of her.
Oh my God.

432
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:09,870
She's on her back.
Oh my God.

433
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,240
Oh my God.
You got that joke.

434
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,270
It just kept going and going back.
And then when holly went to sleep,

435
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,160
I was like,
she didn't even tap.

436
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,800
She's went out.
She went out punching.

437
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,620
She was throwing punches when she went
out to y'all.

438
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:25,230
Bad Ass.
You have to be to go out throwing

439
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:28,410
punches and how bad ass that girl is.

440
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,980
She went out,
she went out like throwing punches.

441
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,580
She didn't want to tap.
Fuck.

442
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,260
That was a good fight.
Woo.

443
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,060
Yeah,
it's amazing.

444
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,860
Back was the best fight of the night.
That was that the biggest UFC ever.

445
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,000
I mean,
Jesus,

446
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:46,500
that was the biggest UFC ever.
I mean,

447
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,440
I would say I the fight of the night,
but he's not the fight of the night.

448
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,440
It's the same.
They're both equally insane.

449
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,040
There's no like one better finale or one
better.

450
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,730
Uh,
and I think the conor fight was more

451
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,630
excited because all the way through
there was a lot of damage going on and

452
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,100
it was a lot of fire gone on with the
holly fight.

453
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:07,470
There was a lot of dancing around taking
shots.

454
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:08,570
It was a Lotta,
you know,

455
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,360
definitely what it was.
There was a lot less action overall.

456
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,650
Yeah.
But if you compress those,

457
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:16,830
if you take out a couple of those rounds
and compress it all into one round,

458
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,390
then yeah,
I see.

459
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,200
I don't think you gotta be pleased by it
through the whole thing.

460
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,220
I think what's most important is that
it,

461
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,000
after it ends,
you have some like definitive conclusion

462
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,790
that if it takes a while to get that
definitive conclusion,

463
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,820
I mean it's going to give a two
firefighters are tactical.

464
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,610
You're right.
But it was because of that that made the

465
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:38,220
end so good.
Without that then it wouldn't have been

466
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:39,600
so juicy at the end.
Exactly.

467
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:42,510
Because she had gone through the full
five or when they were in the fifth

468
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,940
round and it was like,
we've got to see,

469
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:47,320
she's trying things and not working.
She tries this.

470
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:48,730
It works really good.
Okay.

471
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:50,600
Now Holly's trying this,
that's working meets his,

472
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,790
trying that.
That's not working.

473
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,290
Okay.
Now she don't start a kick,

474
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,921
which should go,
Ooh,

475
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,660
she got to do something different to get
close to her.

476
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,910
How's she going to figure it out?
Down on the score.

477
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,610
Shoots for the fucking take down.
Grabs a hold of her,

478
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:03,640
gets her neck jokes or unconscious.
Oh my God.

479
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,440
Yeah,
cause yeah,

480
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:08,980
you wouldn't have been that low from
that stuff to the place went insane.

481
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:11,080
It was insane.
It was so epic.

482
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,650
And then download Misha tate.
Man.

483
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,690
God Damn,
she was so happy.

484
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,820
She's so nice.
You know?

485
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:21,730
She's such an like her and holly,
they're both so nice.

486
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:27,090
It's so nice to see like nice people
like that do really well in such a

487
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:30,910
brutal savage sport.
You know?

488
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,070
She's really nice.
Like when have you ever used

489
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,680
[inaudible]?
Never like raised her voice at anybody.

490
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:38,260
She never yelled at anybody.
She's like real friendly.

491
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,210
She's real sweet to see her.
The UFC bantamweight champion.

492
00:21:42,211 --> 00:21:43,240
I was like,
wow,

493
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,950
this is crazy.
Well,

494
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,120
I wonder performance.

495
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,850
I think holly is a little bit nicer
though.

496
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,840
She's so nice too.
It seems like they're just so some

497
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:54,490
country like wife.
You know what I mean?

498
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,610
She's the preacher's daughter.
She was,

499
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,830
yeah,
she is.

500
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,830
She really is.
She really is.

501
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,960
Wow,
and she's tough as fuck,

502
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,470
dude.
She went out punching out cold.

503
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:08,280
She was like throwing punches.
She just wants to get the in post high.

504
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,030
Then she just wanted to get back into
it.

505
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,123
She was like,
when do you,

506
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,700
she just wants to get back in.
Getting back.

507
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,780
What I loved about the preflight speech
when she was talking about the fight

508
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:17,680
itself,
she was like,

509
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:19,330
you know what?
Rhonda is going to be out for awhile.

510
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,070
She was,
I'm not fighting for money.

511
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,410
I'm not fighting for fame.
I want the action.

512
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,970
I want to fight.
I'm like,

513
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,260
Whoa,
how wild.

514
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,600
What does he,
that's how you got to think.

515
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,890
If you want to be great,
right.

516
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,440
It's any one of them to focus on.
Yeah.

517
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,650
If you want to be a holly Holm,
I guess you have to be like that.

518
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,400
You want to be a 19 time worlds women
boxing champion,

519
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,370
you've got to be like a crazy motivated
person.

520
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:45,010
She's got to,
she's got to fall in love with Jujitsu

521
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:46,910
though,
cause she's not the biggest fan of.

522
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:49,940
She did say she really needs that and
that to us before.

523
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,740
I know that.
I know that that's hard to swallow,

524
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,020
you know,
but uh,

525
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,130
you got to,
you can't be one of those fighters that,

526
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,590
and there's a bunch of them out there,
uh,

527
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,453
that,
uh,

528
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,930
they didn't really want to get
offensively good at Jujitsu.

529
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,820
They didn't really,
uh,

530
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:04,654
have,
uh,

531
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,410
they weren't attracted to passing the
guard,

532
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,040
taking the back and choking PPI.
There's a lot of wrestlers out there

533
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,140
that just want her to keep it on the
feet,

534
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,820
do a little take down the fence.

535
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,120
And if you have to take them down,
stay in half guard and pound them out

536
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:18,040
and just keep it simple and keep it like
that.

537
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,100
You know,
if,

538
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,030
um,
there's a lot of wrestlers like that.

539
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:23,440
Not that she's the restaurant,
they're strikers.

540
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,920
They're strikers like that too.
There's been a quite a few throughout

541
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:29,440
the years,
champions that didn't really want to

542
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,970
work on their,
did you get to the right way,

543
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,790
the right way,
which is sparring with everybody and not

544
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,100
picking her up,
sparring opponents and just jumping in

545
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:37,730
into the fire.
That's how I know o'connor's good

546
00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:40,150
because connor does that and he's going
to get way better.

547
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:42,850
He's actually good at Jujitsu is there's
a lot better.

548
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:46,580
But I think holly needs to have somehow,

549
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,770
somehow it needs to happen.
I don't know how,

550
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,340
but uh,
she needs to fall in love with Jujitsu

551
00:23:51,341 --> 00:23:52,610
and,
and uh,

552
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,150
because I think that's where people
know,

553
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:59,390
I mean that's the spot we already,
we haven't really seen her on her back.

554
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:02,270
We w we haven't seen her react to
Jujitsu and now we have,

555
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:07,100
and Mischa just exposed her and she
needs to get take that she needs to take

556
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:10,190
care of that and fall in love with Jiu
Jitsu and started getting on Instagram,

557
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:12,680
taking pictures with their gay,
you know what I mean?

558
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:14,570
And she's got a blue belt and be all
happy.

559
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,930
She's got to be really happy about it
because um,

560
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,930
she needs,
uh,

561
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,520
there's,
there's a hole right there and that's

562
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:20,630
what people are going to try to take
her.

563
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,190
Yeah,
just not that hard to take down.

564
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:25,130
After all I thought she'd be harder to
take down but you know me,

565
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,750
she took her down for me.
She mixes up or take down times.

566
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,680
She goes at the time

567
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,060
and she goes down low.
Where's Rhonda is like upper body

568
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:34,190
clench.
She's really an upper body clench so all

569
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,420
holly had to do also Rhonda in that
fight was so insanely aggressive.

570
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,680
Her charging after made it so much
easier for counters me.

571
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,080
She was super crafty.
Yep.

572
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,280
She liked very patient,
very patient,

573
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:49,130
varied.
Her movement varied or timing didn't do

574
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:51,950
any like,
like she didn't continue any patterns

575
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,450
with this.
Her stand up,

576
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,810
she moved around a lot and she did a lot
of Juke in and a lot of,

577
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,050
she did a lot of different stuff.
Stayed on the outside,

578
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,090
made holly come after her.
Like if you,

579
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:04,340
if you're,
if you're a really good counter striker

580
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:06,980
like holly is for her,
the best thing is a Rhonda,

581
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,290
like someone's gonna run at her.
The best thing is someone running

582
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,130
addict.
She's,

583
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,610
she's so fleet like her footwork.

584
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,160
So excellent.
She sold light on her feet that she's so

585
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:19,340
good at just sliding out of the way and
cracking you while you coming in.

586
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:20,720
It's like one of the things she's best
at.

587
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,730
So if you fight that way against her,
that's the kind of fight that happens.

588
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:27,020
You look,
she looks like a master,

589
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,560
but if you look at her fight in the very
first UFC fight,

590
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:33,100
we were Raquel Pennington.
She wants to split decision.

591
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:33,951
Yeah.
You know,

592
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:36,320
and that was a fight where were cal
fought more cautious,

593
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:37,340
a little smarter,
new,

594
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:40,370
new holly's background coming in.
You know,

595
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,970
if you don't like,
if you don't engage with her,

596
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,370
it's like,
remember when Anderson was in his prime,

597
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,190
if guys came after him,
he just butchered him.

598
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,430
But if guys hung back,
sometimes a fight was boring,

599
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,840
right?
Like,

600
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:54,561
um,
Talis,

601
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:55,920
late tests.
Remember tonsillitis,

602
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,160
like hung back and he kind of waited for
Anderson.

603
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,110
Um,
same thing with Patrick [inaudible].

604
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,690
Patrick [inaudible] hung back.
He just fought smart.

605
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,200
He's like,
I'm going to charge it and running into

606
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:04,791
anything.
Come,

607
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:06,140
come get me,
come get me.

608
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,310
And [inaudible] like,
oh,

609
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:10,430
he's had a big right hand.
So everybody had to be real careful.

610
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:11,990
You always had to be careful because a
guy,

611
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,120
if you're coming at him,
he could always catch you.

612
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:17,750
And if a guy like coattail catches you,
he just had that stupid power in his

613
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:18,650
hand.
He could just knocked.

614
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:21,140
He knocked out Tito at two oh five.
You remember that?

615
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,590
He knocked him out down,
knocked him down.

616
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,490
Tito don't take a shot,
but he knocked him down at two oh five

617
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,890
and he fights at one 70 now.
You know,

618
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,720
I mean,
Patrick Code taken crack.

619
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:34,360
So Anderson never want,
remember I,

620
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,980
Patrick blew his knee out in that fight.
Yeah.

621
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,220
He like went to throw a kick and his
knee just gave out.

622
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,080
It's right.
Exploded.

623
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,590
Yeah.
He fought a very smart fight too.

624
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:46,290
And that's that stain when you,
you find a killer counterstrike or like

625
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,660
that.
The big thing is like let them lead.

626
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,160
They don't,
they don't want to lead.

627
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,800
Make it a boring fight.
Let it be boring.

628
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,210
Move around,
be patient.

629
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,460
Me,
she did everything right man.

630
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,740
It's amazing.
Rhonda.

631
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,460
Me Three would be nice,
right?

632
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,750
That's probably what it's going to
happen.

633
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,770
It's probably what's gonna happen next
according to,

634
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:04,920
uh,
what I've led on the internets cause I

635
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:07,110
was have here I wanted to,
what Rhonda would want,

636
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:12,130
would she want a
rematch with her after a loss or I would

637
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,590
title shot if I was her out was a tough
choice.

638
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,620
Rather,
if I was her,

639
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,700
I was her,
I'd pure boy.

640
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,140
Tough choice,
right?

641
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:20,220
Boy,
I can't be her.

642
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,380
I,
if I was her,

643
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:26,970
honestly I would probably,
I would imagine if I was her,

644
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:31,971
I'd want to avenge the loss cause holly
was her first loss and she doesn't feel

645
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:35,550
like she did her best in that fight and
that fight was just,

646
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:36,660
she had too much going on.

647
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,490
If you hear her talk about it,
it was like there was,

648
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,450
she's overwhelmed with obligations and
shit and just fought wrong.

649
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
Just didn't,
didn't fight correctly,

650
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,620
just had real problems going into that.
And then you have like her approach like

651
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:52,800
getting in Holly's face the way in and
try and make it real emotional,

652
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,320
you know,
you fake ass bitch and all that stuff.

653
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:58,230
And then all that emotions when she
fought in the ranks just running after

654
00:27:58,231 --> 00:28:03,000
holly and holly just fall like a master,
that was one of the best performances

655
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:07,470
you'll ever see of a striker and
negating a person to aggression.

656
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:11,340
Like she just did it so brilliantly.
Catching her with elbows coming in,

657
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:15,870
catching it with straight lefts and then
that fucking set up for the head kick

658
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:19,800
when Rhonda is all stumbling and she
just catches her with that head kick.

659
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:24,270
I mean just to spectacular mixed martial
arts performance overall,

660
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,830
like one of the best like title winning
efforts in any weight class as far as

661
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:32,060
like a sheer domination,
it's right up there with Tj dillashaw

662
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,330
Hanan Barao one but more,
probably more scary.

663
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,880
It's one of the most spectacular
highlight clips ever.

664
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,530
She's getting clipped.
Yup.

665
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,760
Wow.
Amazing.

666
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,920
Amazing.
It's like she's a bad ass,

667
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,080
you know.
So what I think about holly is,

668
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:48,240
you know,
holly get back on track and uh,

669
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,550
I,
I really hope that she takes that advice

670
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:53,070
that you just gave.
I think that'd be real smart.

671
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,830
He's got to somehow fall in love with
and not fight it no more.

672
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,210
Well,
I dunno if she fights it.

673
00:28:57,211 --> 00:28:58,890
I don't know what the deal is.
Who knows?

674
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,320
You know,
she's just so good at kickboxing.

675
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,543
I think,
uh,

676
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,950
she just wants to stay,
sharpen that.

677
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,620
And that's what she wants to do to girls
because she feels like she has this big

678
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:12,510
advantage of them against them in that.
But obviously she needs a little work on

679
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:14,040
it and I think she'll get better,
man.

680
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,030
She,
she can,

681
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,980
she could still improve,
you know,

682
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,910
and I think maybe there's also the
overwhelming pressure that must come

683
00:29:20,911 --> 00:29:23,790
from being a champ.
Like that experience probably takes a

684
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,080
while and they'll learn how to navigate
it.

685
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,210
I hope I'm wrong and she's already in
love with it.

686
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:29,790
That would be awesome if that was wrong.
And I'm rooting for Holly.

687
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,320
I like holly.
I think holly,

688
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,390
could you not hallway with?
Of course.

689
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:35,460
How could I not like it?
I'm just being real.

690
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,070
I'm sorry if it hurts anybody's
feelings.

691
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:37,750
No,
I,

692
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,090
what you're saying is important.
I hope,

693
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,710
and I hope that I'm wrong.
I hope that you have no idea.

694
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:42,040
She's

695
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,240
totally into,
she's been all,

696
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,600
she just hasn't worked on it that long
or whatever,

697
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,810
but,
uh,

698
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,150
that's,
I would love to see holly home with,

699
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,300
uh,
aggressive offer back and dangerous

700
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:54,070
offer back.
There's no reason why she couldn't be.

701
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:56,070
She's super athletic.
She has a crazy work ethic.

702
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:06,720
Okay.
