1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,140
Hannibal Montana,
is that it?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,160
Montana will experience the Hannibal.
Montana will experience.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,790
Can you get sued for that?
That too.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,810
Or it's parody,
right?

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,240
Is Hannibal Montana Bowl bowls at the
end?

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,890
What is a Montana?
Both Montana Bill Rams is Ramsar

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,960
Hannibal.
What is Hannah Montana?

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,970
See this the show that a cute girl.
Cyrus girl,

9
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:32,280
right.
I hope they sued me to use the bump.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,340
They can't win.
I can't win.

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,890
Right.
It's parody is.

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,550
Yeah.
It is not a mock usually just because I

13
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:43,630
think it's just a goofy thing.
Isn't that my Canadian thing?

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Isn't that I'm not using any imagery.
I just think it's just funny words to

15
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:48,840
me.
Even if you were,

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,580
you know,
I think you're okay.

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,790
Whatever happened to that chick.
She was going crazy for awhile.

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,640
She a number.
She was grinding on people on TV.

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,830
The voice right now that's just started.

20
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,830
She said she wanted the judges or
something.

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,440
Hm.
She's talented girl.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,200
You ever heard of talent?
She sang that song.

23
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,030
Jolene,
like that Dolly Parton Song.

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,410
I was like,
wow.

25
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:14,940
Like if she just sang shit like this,
she'd be goddamn gigantic.

26
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,420
If she changes to with transfer.
Really?

27
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,250
Yeah,
I think she saw that actress.

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,330
What have you seen her in her stuff?
She's been on Saturday night live.

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,320
Oh,
okay.

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,210
I thought you that.
Hannah Montana.

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,560
Hannah Montana back in [inaudible] eight
when I was.

32
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:34,770
I remember watching a couple of episodes
like this is all right.

33
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,260
Also my,
uh,

34
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,770
I used to be a dad fan fence who so
there used to be a dad fan fan fan.

35
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,930
Took too much heat,
man.

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,520
He did.
God Man.

37
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,390
I remember when dad fan was on last
comic standing because it was season one

38
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:54,630
and I was one of the judges and he
fucking killed.

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,130
Right.
And it didn't seem like there was

40
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:58,030
anything wrong what he was doing to me.
Yeah.

41
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,910
But a lot of people get mad at them just
for being.

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,830
No,
it was like they just thought he was

43
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:05,970
too,
uh,

44
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,880
too.
Too much of a big show.

45
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,610
You know,
he's too loud and I don't know what it

46
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:12,960
was.
If they got upset with him.

47
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,930
People like what they like.
People get angry,

48
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:20,931
people get angry at weird stuff.
People just get specifically angry.

49
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,090
Myself included,
but I don't share that for the Internet,

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,500
just angry amongst my friends and we
talk shit,

51
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,750
but I don't like to show that.
Right.

52
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,910
Like he'd get mad if your friend likes a
movie that sucked.

53
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,410
Yeah.
We'll just,

54
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,670
yeah.
Sometimes my friend,

55
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,140
my friend,
um,

56
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,820
didn't.
What was the movie with the,

57
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,280
uh,
with the moving shots?

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,160
Uh,
it was Zach Galifianakis is in it.

59
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,770
Uh,
the Birdman Birdman.

60
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,580
Oh,
Zach.

61
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,040
Zach Galifianakis was in Burbank.
The stage director.

62
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,800
That's right.
Of course I met my friend Tony.

63
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,920
We would denver a toadie Turner.
My Dj,

64
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,230
he uh,
had wanted them.

65
00:02:58,231 --> 00:02:59,980
We patches.
We in Denver for like four

66
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,470
days and he had a weed patch did you
could put on.

67
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,570
He got it from dispensary.
Uh,

68
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,690
and then he got high engine.
We started talking about Birdman.

69
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,300
Yeah.
Birdman.

70
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,590
He went on a 10 minute rant,
like fuck birdman movies.

71
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:15,790
Pretentious.
And he's just like,

72
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:16,680
man,
he was like,

73
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,820
I like Birdman,
but I don't know if I like it as much as

74
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,500
you hated it went on forever.

75
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,450
I couldn't believe it.
He's Kinda got a point.

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,510
It's kind of pretentious,
but I mean don't you want that sometimes

77
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,810
like someone to take a chance to make
something that's just bizarre.

78
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:33,130
There was a bizarre ass movie like that
was a chance to take a newbie and then.

79
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,073
Yeah,
they was,

80
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,800
I enjoyed it.
I'd never seen somebody be so passionate

81
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,980
about it.
Be around your friendly.

82
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,853
I didn't know you were a kid.

83
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,370
Hey,
people get like that with music.

84
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,250
Yeah.
You know,

85
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,760
you can talk to some people about
certain bands.

86
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,160
Just not supposed to.
Like,

87
00:03:50,161 --> 00:03:53,830
like when I was a kid I used to have to
hide the fact that I loved kiss.

88
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,890
Yeah.
Because like when I was in like seventh

89
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:59,370
grade kiss was not cool.
I was like,

90
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,630
it was not a cool thing.
Like the young kids,

91
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,610
they won't,
they all wanted to know about like ACDC

92
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,610
and led Zeppelin.
So where,

93
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,150
uh,
when you were in seventh grade where was

94
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,560
kiss in their trajectory?
Here's what happened with kiss kiss had

95
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:18,940
this gigantic loyal following who came
to all their concerts.

96
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:21,520
They sold out gigantic arenas all over
the world,

97
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,360
but they couldn't get any radio play.
It was a real weird.

98
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:28,600
They only have like a couple of big hits
they have like bath.

99
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,180
Bath was a big hit.
Detroit rock city,

100
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:34,390
rock and roll all night.
Those were big in party every day.

101
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,140
That's still a big one,
but there wasn't a lot of radio play.

102
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,150
It was hard,
like there was a lot of bands that had

103
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:42,520
way more radio play,
but for whatever reason,

104
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,210
they never lost their popularity amongst
their hardcore fans because they put on

105
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:48,880
a great show.
I went to see them twice when they made

106
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:52,020
their comeback tour with Kevin James.
Kevin James was.

107
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,071
No,
no,

108
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:53,561
no,
no.

109
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,000
We were friends.
We went to watch it.

110
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,590
Kevin.
Combination that would be doing some

111
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:07,430
standup up.
Have you ever done stand up in front of

112
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:09,140
a band?
Lots of times,

113
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,220
yeah.
Do you really?

114
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,450
Yeah.
Do you like it?

115
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,140
Sometimes.
Sometimes it can go.

116
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:14,820
Well,
you have to be set up correctly though,

117
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:19,080
and I've learned how to.
What's asked for to make this show go

118
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:19,711
right.
What's.

119
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:21,750
What do you ask for?
You just asked for somebody from the

120
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:25,230
band to introduce you.
Either onstage or off my and so you

121
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:28,800
establish in front of the crowd as a
friend of theirs and that just some

122
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,120
asshole that where the band says,
we booked this guy,

123
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:36,060
this guy,
please welcome Hannibal buress.

124
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:38,610
I learned that when I open for this
band,

125
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:40,140
it's cool.
Super Nice guys.

126
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:41,820
They saw me as Zane.
He's in Chicago,

127
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:43,620
the Chicago band,
a jam band.

128
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,250
Unfree Mcgee's a huge fan base.
They tour all the time and they asked me

129
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:49,500
to do this gig and the cow outside of
Chicago.

130
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,010
So excited to do it.
Just a couple hundred bucks or something

131
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,670
different gig opening for a band is cool
and it's packed.

132
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,260
Theater is packed.
And then uh,

133
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,240
they telling me that,
you know,

134
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:07,241
it's getting ready to go out and uh,
the lights drop and the crowd goes crazy

135
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,230
and I'm about to go home and that is not
for me at all.

136
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,040
And so then I just walk out and cold
like hello,

137
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,870
I'm Hannah.
And started trying to do comedy.

138
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,320
And people just like,
where's

139
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,360
unfreeze?
And they just didn't know.

140
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,960
We didn't know to just,
you know,

141
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:29,510
every crowd isn't ready for comedy.
You have to settle,

142
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,540
people have to be expecting it'll be
settled or it's a fight and I wasn't

143
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:38,000
prepped to fight at that a moment just
to fight them down.

144
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,130
I did all right,
but that's it.

145
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,240
Sometimes I'll do shows where I have a
rappers or band's opened for me also and

146
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,510
sometimes the crowd at some people in
the crowd into it,

147
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:51,050
some people aren't,
but it's music that I enjoy so I try to

148
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,500
just mix it up sometimes and have a bit
of a variety show versus just straight

149
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:54,950
stand up.

150
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,780
Why not?
That's what you want to do.

151
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,850
You definitely do it.
I've,

152
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,620
I've opened for a few bands back in the
day,

153
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,050
but I'll never do it again.
Some of the experiences were just

154
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:04,090
terrific.
Yeah.

155
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,670
I opened for Bon Jovi once it's theater
in the round.

156
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,090
It was just thing for vh one.
It was in the round and I was on stage

157
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,920
with like a bunch of musical
instruments,

158
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,170
like a lot of like it's like there was a
drum kit there,

159
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:17,870
how to move around.
I couldn't do anything physical.

160
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:21,590
There was like a little microphone set
up and then uh,

161
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,920
after I did my set,
I was supposed to bring girls towards

162
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:27,290
the front of the stage.
They wanted to pick out attractive girls

163
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,680
in the audience,
go back saying no,

164
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,390
no,
no,

165
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,700
around the stage.
So the one they're filming it,

166
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,800
they're the ones who are really close to
the camera,

167
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:37,400
screaming Bon Jovi and then dirt bag for
backstage.

168
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,110
Right if they turned you and to me into
the wrangler.

169
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,750
But you can also grab some girls.
Here's the deal,

170
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:48,320
Bro.
Were Road dogs know they,

171
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:49,850
uh,
they wanted a bunch of because they were

172
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:52,190
filming it for like vh one,
I think it was at the time,

173
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,920
but I was like,
I can't do keep you on these.

174
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,560
They just don't go well 50 percent of
the time.

175
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,520
Yeah,
it's,

176
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,470
I mean I've done some,
you know,

177
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:03,290
chance the rapper,
his rapper out of Chicago.

178
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,630
Uh,
I've done some stuff with him and

179
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,740
sometimes he'll go,
well,

180
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,890
and it was one in Chicago and I'm from
Chicago.

181
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,150
So I'm thinking this is going to be
great.

182
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:13,970
This is my city to dude.
It was just,

183
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,550
it was because I made fun of a,
you know,

184
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,310
Chicago is that live in the city will,
uh,

185
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,100
sometimes you,
you'll meet somebody and you're like,

186
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:22,880
where are you from?

187
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,580
Chicago.
What part of Chicago was like?

188
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,390
Schaumburg,
Chicago,

189
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,800
suburban.
That's what that Improv is 40 minutes

190
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,440
outside of Chicago.
It's a suburban kind of city,

191
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:35,300
sort of thousand oaks.
Yeah.

192
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:37,910
That type of thing.
And so I talked about that.

193
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:39,740
I did that on stage.
It was just,

194
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,770
it was the venue was in the city and
then I talked about that on stage,

195
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:48,800
but most of that crowd was like white
kids from the suburbs and then it just

196
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,840
turned from that and they were just
started.

197
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:53,390
It just got,
got restless and then some dude just

198
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:55,950
yelled out for no reason.
Just like Kevin Hart.

199
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,420
I was like,
what does that mean?

200
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,130
Wow,
that's hilarious.

201
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,920
Some psychology shit,
right?

202
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,120
He's going to point to the most
successful comic ever compare.

203
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:09,720
You mean Kevin Hart is,
if he's not the most successful,

204
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:11,250
he's like top two,
right?

205
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,070
I mean,
who,

206
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,020
who,
what are the arguments?

207
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,160
There's three arguments,
right?

208
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:17,460
It's like dice clay,
Dane Cook and Kevin Hart and as far as

209
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:18,870
sustaining it,
yeah,

210
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,880
he's.
His run has been pretty crazy insane and

211
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:23,730
he has his own shoe,
so I think it's him.

212
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,900
He's kind of motivational shoe,
motivational quotes all over it and

213
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,261
it's.
Shoot.

214
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:31,980
Actually Kevin Hart's shoot looks better
than a lot of athletes.

215
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:33,870
Shoes.
Definitely.

216
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,200
He's a smart dude.
He's worked hard,

217
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,760
but that's funny that he thinks that
like yelling that out.

218
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,190
It's going to hurt your feelings.
It was just more weird.

219
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,980
It is weird.
It is weird,

220
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:48,660
but that's a,
that's a,

221
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:50,580
that's a jab.
You know,

222
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,020
it's interesting that people do that.
Like you point to like La as if almost

223
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:58,770
as if someone's success,
even though it's like astronomical,

224
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:03,090
like crazy success even to a really
successful guy like you.

225
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,530
It will fuck with you.

226
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,860
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

227
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,280
I mean you do really well.
I know you're not walking around going

228
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:13,380
bad.
I wish my life was fucking better right

229
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:13,981
now.
No,

230
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,500
you're great.
Everything's awesome in your world.

231
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,600
Everything is smooth as fuck.
But someone can yell out.

232
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:22,080
Kevin Hart
know people,

233
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,420
it's a,
it's a weird space to be in because some

234
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,220
night now you have that to that.
It's a different way.

235
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:34,170
You got your fans and then you also have
people that just know who you are and

236
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:36,450
might fuck with you at all.
They just know they like.

237
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,190
And so I,
I went into this Mexican restaurant in

238
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:42,210
Chicago last week

239
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,610
and uh,
I uh,

240
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,240
I go straight to the bathroom and it is
a great spot in Chicago by the way,

241
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:51,240
check it out.
Are in

242
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,480
Lincoln and Fullerton and uh,
go to the back

243
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,950
and I come back out as he's tall too
tall black woman and uh,

244
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,740
one of them like I'm right next to us.
She gestures towards me.

245
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,320
Yeah,
he's famous or something like real

246
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:08,030
dismissive.
I hadn't said anything to her.

247
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,760
I was just being famous or something.
And she says to me,

248
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:13,520
yeah,
my friends tried to get me to come hang

249
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:15,800
out with you at mad river bar in
Chicago.

250
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,870
Had tried to get you to come and hang
out,

251
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,960
but we didn't want to.
All right,

252
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,370
why don't you.
But we didn't want to.

253
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,030
Yeah,
some like what are you,

254
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,650
what's happening right now?
Like what are you.

255
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,240
And so I look at her body and she's in
great shape at six to short,

256
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:30,780
short song.
She got a volleyball books,

257
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,090
so I say,
you play volleyball?

258
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:32,931
She said,
yeah,

259
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:35,530
we played at Depaul and so,
uh,

260
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,003
they order their food

261
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:41,270
down to order my food,
sit down and then I go on my phone and I

262
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,280
google a depaul women's volleyball and
look at a last year and look at the

263
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:52,340
roster and I look over to her.
I say,

264
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,790
uh,
Hey Ashley,

265
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,460
what the fuck happened last season?
They had a bad season

266
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,410
and in a friend pipes up.
Hey,

267
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,680
we had a lot of good individual
competency assessment,

268
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,330
individual records last year.
And I said,

269
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,830
so you guys had bad teeth?

270
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,723
Chemistry?

271
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,710
But yeah,
it was just,

272
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:21,810
I felt the need to dig back because I
was just grabbing some fucking tacos and

273
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,070
she just made me feel weird just by
being there.

274
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,020
Well,
she felt like she could get a free shot

275
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:31,400
at you because you're famous war or she
just does that to people all the time.

276
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,670
Maybe she does.
Maybe she just had a baby.

277
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,050
I was intimidated.
She was tall.

278
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,460
Beautiful girl,
beautiful girl.

279
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,990
We were like a voice.
Maybe a town like mine.

280
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,460
Maybe I couldn't handle my own tone is
actually.

281
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,160
Sounds like you not like me,
but she had kind of not depth but just

282
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:49,994
suck.
Yeah.

283
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,620
Tone that way.
Yeah.

284
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,110
Yeah.
Maybe she was being rude.

285
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,550
She may have been just a big rude,
giant bitch at once.

286
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,060
Like dude,
to take that challenge.

287
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,700
You know what I mean?
Like if you're a girl that's that big

288
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,650
and athletic,
he could probably fuck up a lot of

289
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,484
dudes.
Yeah.

290
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,360
You know,
that's a big girl.

291
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,090
She probably has to like,
she probably has to test dudes all the

292
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:12,600
time.

293
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,430
Maybe.
Maybe she was nagging me and I took it

294
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:17,170
the wrong way.

295
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,060
Yeah.
Maybe if you just took it like an ace,

296
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,550
you just rolled with it.
Like a Shaolin Monk.

297
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,740
Yeah.
Maybe you did neck back,

298
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,720
but the.
But that.

299
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,160
That's actually pretty funny.
So wait,

300
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:31,180
did I think everything works out great?
I mean,

301
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,840
I know where to find them.
Find it.

302
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,460
I don't know why.
I always want to wonder what someone's

303
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:37,870
motivation is,
but I always do.

304
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,930
I do too.
You never know.

305
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,360
It's almost like,
why am I bothering?

306
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,780
Why can I just get the fuck away from
this?

307
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,580
Why do I have to find out what someone's
motivation is?

308
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,663
Yeah.
People,

309
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,840
yeah.
I ended up in,

310
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,840
in conversations where I should just
probably leave,

311
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:53,510
but I'm just curious about what's going
on.

312
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,160
Like who the fuck are you?
Why?

313
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,533
What is your,

314
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,220
what?
What's up with you?

315
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,570
Do that.
Yeah.

316
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,440
And also I have to.
When I have to win.

317
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,990
Well,
it's a game that you're really good at.

318
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,900
Shit talking game.
You get upset when someone starts

319
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,070
talking with you.
I'm like,

320
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,090
wait a minute.
You're a goddamn amateur here.

321
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,300
You should talk about the professional
comedian.

322
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,170
How often have you done this?
How good are you at this?

323
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:21,480
For Real.
It was fun though.

324
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,050
It is fun.
It's all fun and games to someone's soul

325
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:27,600
gets crushed.
He doesn't happen in Vegas.

326
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,420
Just a.
It was this girl that I.

327
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,730
no,
not really known that well,

328
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:36,360
but she's beautiful and she hit me up
out of nowhere.

329
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,530
Hey,
I miss you,

330
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,560
we never messed around and anything,
you know,

331
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,670
and I was just as you,
she missed you.

332
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,900
And so,
uh,

333
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,563
I uh,

334
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,790
I was in Boston at the moment.
I think I'll just in a sort of a,

335
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,040
not a bad move,
a weird mood,

336
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,600
impulsive and she just hit me up out of
nowhere that,

337
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,540
let's go to vegas with a UFC fight,
shit flyer out.

338
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,030
We'd get to the airport around the same
time,

339
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,360
go out,
go to a Calvin Harris has playing,

340
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,660
go there and we get back to the room and
she's Kinda like cold towards me.

341
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:13,650
Like almost buddy.
I'm like,

342
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,910
Eh,
I mean we never really hung out,

343
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:20,050
but it's still like flying to Vegas.
It's a,

344
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:25,270
it's a vibe and it's a little bit of a
subtext to that is vegas also this

345
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,620
associates,
she kind of just go to sleep on me.

346
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:32,410
I'm like,
we ain't gonna fucking vegas visas.

347
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,150
What the fuck is going on?
What's happening?

348
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,410
You thought you missed?
And so,

349
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:38,330
uh,
end up,

350
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,700
uh,
in the morning,

351
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,710
go for it again.
Like,

352
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,550
she's kind of,
it's like,

353
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,250
I'm like,
does this chick even like,

354
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,400
you know,
it's like I go down on her,

355
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,400
she's completely quiet,
but like moving her body positively,

356
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,820
but not saying a word but not saying a
word to the point where I'm like,

357
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,690
I gotta check and see if this is okay.
I popped my head up.

358
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:58,521
I'm like,
Hey,

359
00:15:58,521 --> 00:15:59,354
we good

360
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,660
just because I had to do it.
Had to do a consent check.

361
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,880
Marius.
That's a good move though.

362
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,803
Yeah,
Dude.

363
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,270
I had to check.
Man,

364
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,980
are we good?
You good?

365
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,610
She's like,
we're good.

366
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,610
I was back at it,
but she didn't make a noise.

367
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,640
You know,
how weird pussies and sounds with no

368
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:24,710
moaning or yeps uh,
yes

369
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,081
it would.
Nothing.

370
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:27,860
No,
no,

371
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,360
it was just,
it was weird.

372
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:31,860
But I could tell she I've been thinking
about nothing else for

373
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,570
no moaning,
just acapella pussy eating.

374
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,440
But I could feel her body,
like she's moving the body around.

375
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,890
I could,
I could tell she came a couple times

376
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,310
[inaudible] like air came out.
I don't think that's how it works.

377
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,110
I think it is.
I was like,

378
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,470
because at one point yet I feel some air
coming out.

379
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,090
It wasn't a,
but it didn't make a noise.

380
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,090
Um,
I don't think we're ever going to really

381
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:00,440
know if they're coming or not.

382
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,140
I think it can be a lot of fuckery going
on.

383
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,730
A lot of fake orgasms.
We don't know.

384
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:10,070
A lot of times girls just fake come so
that you could stop real.

385
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,640
I don't know,
I'm guessing it must've happened,

386
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,270
but I'm just saying I don't think error
coming out constitutes orgasm.

387
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,250
Seems like it should.
Well there should be like a little

388
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,930
Turkey tests or the baby.
She loves me.

389
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,250
Whatever.
We ended up hooking up,

390
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:29,780
but I go out to lunch and then I
realized we just no,

391
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,820
no computer,
no compatibility.

392
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:35,720
All this chicken does it.
Even like when you eat her pussy.

393
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,840
So I need to know,
need to know.

394
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:41,960
It's just lazier.
Doesn't like it,

395
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,130
it all or it's just bad at showing it
does.

396
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:48,930
It can't even fake.
Just wants to be at the Pfizer.

397
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,610
So we get back to the room.
I'm getting ready.

398
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:55,910
It's like three ish.
So getting rambling.

399
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:56,760
I'm gonna.
See the whole thing,

400
00:17:56,761 --> 00:18:00,810
you'll see the prelims and uh,
uh,

401
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,450
so,
but I'm trying to get it in again,

402
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,190
isn't hooked up again.
First Time you have to tell me.

403
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,790
And then she says,
I don't Hook up on the first night.

404
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,310
I'm like,
we already did it already.

405
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:12,540
What are you talking about?
She's like,

406
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,710
yeah,
that's my role.

407
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:15,540
I don't do it on.
It's like,

408
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,980
what are you talking about?
She's like,

409
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,270
my,
me and my roommates.

410
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:22,380
That's our house rule or how's your cock
blocking bitches?

411
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,190
You fucking fly out in the first eight.
What are you talking about?

412
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:28,500
You already,
we already did it and it's not your

413
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:31,410
house is it?
And so like what is,

414
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,260
I don't want to know who does that.
That's weird.

415
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,900
And so I Kinda,
I stepped out of the room,

416
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,900
make a phone call.
I talk to my friends to consultant.

417
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,530
What the fuck do I do with this shit?
And

418
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,530
sleeve all your shit in the room and buy
new shit.

419
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,380
That's what you do.
You just know you just,

420
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,830
you,
you have your phone in your hand.

421
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:50,040
Do you have a computer back in the room?
I didn't.

422
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,430
Okay,
so you go back in,

423
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,500
you don't want to leave the computer,
you go grab your computer,

424
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:54,370
you go,
I'll be right back.

425
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,420
And then you never come back.
That's what I came back in.

426
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,970
I came back and
came back in a room.

427
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:04,660
I say I
buy new clothes.

428
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,590
No,
I'm going to take somebody

429
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,810
out in the fight with the computer that
have been great.

430
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,730
I said I would do it.
I say I'm going to take somebody else to

431
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:15,940
the fight.
Oh Shit.

432
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,000
Uh Oh.
I have my assistant gets you a separate

433
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:22,570
hotel room and I'll buy you a single
ticket to the fight if you want.

434
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,980
But you know,
I don't feel like you feeling me and

435
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:29,800
it'd be a disservice to both of us in
wasting each other's time,

436
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,770
but you have another hotel room.
I'll get you a ticket to the.

437
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,590
That's a gentleman's move.
I like,

438
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,900
that's better than what I was gonna do.
I was going to run out the door with a

439
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:41,900
computer,
but it felt weird to do it and it felt

440
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:44,600
weird to build up to doing it.
But I had a great night.

441
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:48,170
Man,
I hung out with another friend in Vegas

442
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:50,870
and she's much better person.
Beautiful.

443
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,400
Yeah.
It's weird though.

444
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,290
Well that's my fault for that,
but you haven't had a real conversation

445
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,990
with her and I flew this woman out.
That's how beautiful she was.

446
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,310
Why you took a chance life so fast.
You could meet someone like that on the

447
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:06,080
first night.
They could be the best person you ever

448
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,360
met in your life and you fall in love
forever.

449
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,111
Right,
Jamie?

450
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:11,790
That's true.
I mean you definitely can.

451
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,530
I support you on both decisions.
Yeah.

452
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,200
I support you on your impulsiveness and
just flying out a beautiful woman and I

453
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:21,290
support you in continuing to eat her
pussy and asking for consent and the

454
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,910
middle of it.
I support you on that.

455
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,500
Definitely support you.
Getting there another room and doing it

456
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:29,060
classy and getting her a ticket to the
ticket,

457
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,000
but that's.
Yeah,

458
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,560
even better.
Can I support you 100 percent.

459
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,290
That's a fuck.
You got an a plus or if I was your

460
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,760
teacher,
your professor and how to be a man.

461
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,530
I gave you a fucking a plus.
Thank you.

462
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,360
I'm getting better.
I'm grown up,

463
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,800
successful comedian with resources.
Fly that lady out.

464
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,350
She might be the girl you dreams.
Maybe be able to settle down next time.

465
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:55,840
Burse settled down.
It's hard trying to grown up.

466
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,210
I bought a building up also real estate.
Bought an apartment building in Chicago.

467
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,470
Oh Shit.
A whole building.

468
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,480
The whole building.
Three unit apartment building.

469
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,650
Do you live in it?
I just bought it.

470
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:07,510
Don't.
I don't live in his tenants now,

471
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:09,850
but I want to airbnb.
Wow,

472
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,160
that's interesting man.
What if you started fucking Hannibal

473
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:14,100
burress hotel?
I was thinking that's what.

474
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,720
That's like a five,
10 year,

475
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,730
five,
maybe 10 years now.

476
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:24,150
I would have to either get other people
in with funding and stuff,

477
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:27,970
but I looked at this one place.
It's just one building in Chicago,

478
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:31,000
but it's a.
it's a lot of money and they will have

479
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:32,800
to be an all cash buyer and I can't do
it,

480
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:34,810
so I'm trying to get other people to
partner up.

481
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,930
Man.
The hotel business sounds interesting,

482
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,390
like if you like.
Have you developed a cool because it's

483
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:44,290
kind of entertaining in a way like
you're in attain those people.

484
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,930
It's not off bro,
my man,

485
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,670
I'm traveling all the time.
I'm in hotels so I kind of know what I

486
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:49,870
like in a,
in a hotel,

487
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,610
but you know what I mean,
like the experience of going to a hotel

488
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,070
is and a lot of ways like an
entertaining experimentally,

489
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:59,590
the lounge,
what you have in a lot of stuff in the

490
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:00,580
rooms,
you know,

491
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,670
in a lot of ways.
Like even the other way like there's a

492
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:08,530
motel six and catch a Canada,
Alaska that I stayed at and uh,

493
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,840
it's fucking great or hotel sector,
hotel sex.

494
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,680
But uh,
because it's so ridiculous because it's

495
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:16,680
in this really remote place.
Yeah.

496
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,760
It's,
there's something cool about that.

497
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,440
You know,
there's something cool about just the

498
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:23,800
standard ness of it all the wood panels
on the door and you know,

499
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:24,634
like that kind of shit.

500
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,960
I don't even know if they have wood
panels,

501
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:29,830
but you know what I mean like that.
Like Standard Motel six type look when

502
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:33,310
you even near a place like that that
like if you went to a place like

503
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:37,480
Ketchikan Alaska and there was a four
seasons right now with like a,

504
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,780
some sort of a fireplace as broken glass
in it.

505
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,580
Like one of those,
one of those weird ones.

506
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,050
You'd be like,
what the fuck is this?

507
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,520
It wouldn't make any sense,
but the Hannibal burress hotel,

508
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,290
I seen a lot of red velure.
I see a lot like this room.

509
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:58,090
I see red valora black see gold lace.
I see like a beautiful design to the

510
00:22:58,091 --> 00:22:59,800
place.
I hear good music,

511
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,330
good food.
Smells good.

512
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,070
Food is good.
It's wonderful.

513
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,170
Our food.
Twenty four hour food,

514
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:09,670
reasonable many bar prices.
I'm like I need to make a profit but I'm

515
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:10,810
not going to fuck you over.

516
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,210
How many people were talking about in
this hotel?

517
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:14,320
How big?
Little right?

518
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:16,000
Like a boatload of one for the first
one,

519
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,670
something like 20 to 30 rooms,
something like that.

520
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,710
That's beautiful.
That's like a fucking party.

521
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,810
20 rooms,
it's like a party,

522
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,500
like if you had like we all have,
we all gathered up all of our friends

523
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:30,250
that we knew and we all brought
girlfriends or wives and there's 20 of

524
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:31,120
us.
We could.

525
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,780
We could fill a goddamn 20 room hotel.
Yeah,

526
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,830
easy.
Definitely man,

527
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,200
that's a good move.
Trying to.

528
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:43,290
I want to do entertainment for fun like
seven years from now and that foot

529
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:46,000
money.
Yeah.

530
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,990
You know what I mean?
Whereas that was not necessary to go on

531
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:55,020
the road or do a TV show or do a movie
where it's like,

532
00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:00,080
I would really love to do that.
Well then I'm torn because I want your

533
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:02,600
hotel to be successful,
but I want you to keep doing comedy.

534
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,430
I don't want you to turn into a lazy
pitch.

535
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,420
Not a lazy bitch,
but I would be doing stuff with my real

536
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:10,910
estate.
I wanna I wanna get my goal.

537
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:12,710
I want to get another building this year
and him.

538
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,740
You're a magnet and do to get to
multifamily properties a year for the

539
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:21,690
next five years and then ran for
president and then.

540
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,613
No,
no,

541
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,610
because that only pays 400,000 a year,
but it's the speaking fees.

542
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,360
Speaking feats,
whew.

543
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,290
That's when you make all your money.
You do do your eight years.

544
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,970
Then when you get out,
you make a billion dollars on bomb is

545
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,340
gonna.
Make a.

546
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,650
let me tell you a couple of millions.
You don't know who should be rooting and

547
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:46,730
crossing his fingers that trump wins as
obama because if,

548
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,300
if trump wins,
Obama will make so much fucking money.

549
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,910
Talking about,
you know,

550
00:24:51,911 --> 00:24:55,550
like democracy and giving speeches about
what it's like to be a president and

551
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:57,380
what it's like to run the greatest
nation in the world.

552
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,790
Fine.
Either way,

553
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,560
trump always going to be fine either
way,

554
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:02,810
but he couldn't like it literally
doubled his money.

555
00:25:02,811 --> 00:25:05,450
If trump ones deep.
Here's a theory.

556
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:06,740
A lot of people have said,
Nah,

557
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:10,250
I don't think he wants to win.
Do you think he wants to win with the

558
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:12,620
moves he's been pulling?
I don't know man.

559
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,430
They said he has one office,
one campaign office in Florida that has

560
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,080
four employees.
You had perfect

561
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:24,410
like Hashtag tiger blood.
He's not.

562
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,110
I mean,
beyond the idiotic shit he said he's not

563
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:33,250
really running an efficient campaign.
It's entirely possible that he doesn't

564
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:36,350
really want to win.
If you think about it,

565
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,560
it's entirely possible that he thought
that it would be like,

566
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:42,740
remember when Howard stern ran for
governor of New York because that

567
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,000
nineties?
Yeah.

568
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,330
Something like that wasn't Jamie.
Um,

569
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,260
I think it was somewhere in there,
but,

570
00:25:48,261 --> 00:25:50,360
um,
I don't think Howard stern really wanted

571
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:51,194
to be the governor.

572
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,370
Governor,
governor.

573
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,350
Uh,
I just think he wanted to have some fun.

574
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,050
Right.
And that might've been what happened

575
00:25:57,051 --> 00:26:00,080
with Donald Trump.
Like he might've been just thinking he

576
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:05,030
was going to make a splash.
Have some fun and a nice into deep.

577
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,190
Yeah.
He was still doing his TV show back

578
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,090
then.
Remember,

579
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,940
like he was still the celebrity
apprentice guy or whatever.

580
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:13,850
It is not a celebrity apprentice.
Is that the name of the show?

581
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,700
Why is it sounds so stupid.
Just the apprentice.

582
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:21,701
Then it was the apprentice.
So NBC fired him from that show.

583
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,960
Yeah,
because you were saying a bunch of shit

584
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:25,910
about Mexicans and when they fired him
from the show,

585
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:28,610
that's when he ramped it up and when he
ramped it up,

586
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,490
that's when he got more and more popular
and that's when he won the Republican

587
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:34,100
nomination.
Like it's all part of it is because NBC

588
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:39,101
canceled his fucking show.
That's what happened and this is where

589
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:41,660
we got to blame.
We got NBC and we got Caitlyn Jenner

590
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,190
because there's a part of America

591
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,550
that when Caitlyn Jenner one the woman
of the year have to being a woman for

592
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:51,390
six months and when espn did that giant
piece on her and you know,

593
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:55,260
they're fucking flying over our house
with a helicopter and the drapes are

594
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:57,780
blowing in the breeze and she's hiding
in the shadows and you're like,

595
00:26:57,781 --> 00:27:00,720
what the fuck?
There's a part of America that was like,

596
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:05,250
fuck this know.
Got To put our foot down.

597
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,200
We got to put our fucking foot down now.
And then trump came along.

598
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,850
I'm an asshole.
And they were like,

599
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,650
I'm an asshole to stand up,
stand proud people got upset.

600
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,380
I think there's like an ebb and flow to
shit.

601
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:23,190
I think when things go too left wing,
too progressive to transgenders in the

602
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:25,170
bathroom,
all that crazy shit when that.

603
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,170
When that goes down,
there's a part of America just not ready

604
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:32,440
yet and they go foot and that's where
you get trump has ssi.

605
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,260
That solitary solid right

606
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,820
is.
I'm a little fascinated.

607
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
When I watched the people in the crowd
just really agreeing,

608
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,730
lift the bullshit.
He said when he said the stuff,

609
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,270
black people,
what are you got to lose?

610
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,870
You add no jobs.
Everybody's in poverty and it's people

611
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:52,820
in the back like,
yeah,

612
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,110
yeah.
He said a speech.

613
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,070
It's a speech.
Oh,

614
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,120
please fill in.
The black voters just say you don't.

615
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,650
There's no jobs.
You live in poverty.

616
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:06,540
The schools are bad.
It's 58 percent unemployment with the

617
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:07,800
youth.
I mean,

618
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:10,260
what do you got to lose?
It's pretty good impression.

619
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,520
It's not bad.
I know exactly who you're doing.

620
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,610
While we were watching earlier when he
said that Obama founded isis.

621
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,570
We're watching that earlier with like,
this is like a pro wrestling show.

622
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,070
Like he's saying some crazy shit for it,
but he's saying some plates.

623
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:25,940
We could hear it.
Jamie

624
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,010
trump asking for the vote of every
scene.

625
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,100
African-Americans suffered under
democratic control.

626
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,750
To those I say the following.
Oh my God,

627
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,990
what do you have to lose by trying
something new like trump?

628
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,210
What do you have to lose?
I hope he's high as fuck right now and

629
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,380
he's making a documentary
shadow from the head cover.

630
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:02,220
It is dumb eyes,
Chris Bells filming all this serious.

631
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,210
Secretly look at them.
They're all screaming,

632
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,850
cheering this black woman back there

633
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,820
again.
What do you look?

634
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,290
Why do you have to lose?
You're living in poverty.

635
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,590
Your schools are no good.
You have no jobs.

636
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,730
Fifty eight percent of your youth is
unemployed.

637
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,110
What the hell do you have to lose?

638
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,670
Wow.
It's amazing to watch the movies.

639
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:29,780
A coen brothers movie.

640
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:35,770
Let the end of four years.
I guarantee you that I will get over 95

641
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:41,470
percent of the African American vote.
I you.

642
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,210
I promise you why?
But even just saying that,

643
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,170
like,
what?

644
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,970
Who gives a shit?
If you're what?

645
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,590
What percentage?
How do you know that?

646
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,710
He doesn't have a plan,
he just talk.

647
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,510
It is.
It's fat,

648
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,280
but the crowd is wet.
Yeah.

649
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,030
If he was doing that for 30 people,
like,

650
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,390
okay,
I get it,

651
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,150
but

652
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:06,440
I have some pretty significant theories.
I think that people are way too soft.

653
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:10,520
I think it's way too easy to stay alive
and I think we've never ever had that in

654
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:15,200
human history and I think that we're
over because of it at a ridiculous rate

655
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,770
and I think there's a bunch of people
out there that have no business fucking

656
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,780
and slash or having kids.
Well,

657
00:30:20,781 --> 00:30:22,940
you just turned very serious.
I'm fucking serious.

658
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,170
And it's not their fault.
It's no one's fault.

659
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:30,410
It's no one's fault.
It's just the cycle that we're in.

660
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:34,340
We're in a cycle of safety.
We're in a cycle of safety.

661
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,800
That's what we're in a cycle of
recreational outrage.

662
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,990
People are getting outrage at things
that don't make any sense.

663
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:42,440
The reason why there's no life
threatening situations that are

664
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,810
constantly at your door.
There's no wolves,

665
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,030
there's no fucking.
Nothing's going wrong.

666
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,100
So we're,
we're going after words.

667
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:50,930
You can't say retarded anymore,
you know,

668
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:52,370
don't say tranny.
Don't,

669
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:57,290
we're getting outraged about shit that
doesn't make any sense.

670
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:02,360
Product of the Internet is that didn't
survive the war.

671
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,990
Bad example.
Having wolves to come at you.

672
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,750
You're doing.
I think that's just a product of the

673
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:09,730
Internet.
People being able to react to something

674
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:12,010
and being able to,
uh,

675
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,210
gather together on something and then
start a petition.

676
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,340
Yeah.
Those are bad examples I have who's

677
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,950
retarded is not a bad example because
it's like,

678
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:22,870
it doesn't,
that doesn't mean a disease.

679
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,540
It just means someone who's slow to get
things.

680
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,530
We should not a medically imply that
you're picking on someone with a mental

681
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:30,730
illness.
And in fact,

682
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:34,360
when people initially had down syndrome,
when the birth certificates would come,

683
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:38,710
it would call them a mongoloid idiot.
That would be like what it would be

684
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:43,630
listed on the actual birth certificate.
Mongoloid Mongolo idiot.

685
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,030
Very straightforward.
It's very straightforward and very

686
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:46,864
bizarre,
harsh,

687
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,010
hard times.
These are hard times,

688
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:50,670
but we're talking about.
It's good.

689
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,940
It looks.
Everything is good.

690
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,730
It's better to be alive right now is as
good as it gets.

691
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,060
This is a beautiful time,
but we're going to get things like that.

692
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,880
We're going to get things like that
trump thing because it's so fucking easy

693
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:02,350
to stay alive,
to be alive.

694
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,590
But it's fun.
It's fun for it to be easy to be alive.

695
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,400
Exactly.
I was at my friend's house.

696
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,290
Just kind of bounced back.

697
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:13,130
Yeah.
He was playing ps four and uh,

698
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:18,250
he was playing baseball on a ps four,
which I think is horrible.

699
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,190
It wasn't horrible.
Baseball video games.

700
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:23,960
I'm not in.
So give me football game,

701
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,240
a basketball game.
He fighting,

702
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,980
give me a fighting game,
give me some,

703
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:28,700
some shooting.
But baseball,

704
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,710
it's not good on a video game that to
me,

705
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,620
obviously it's everybody likes what they
likes,

706
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:37,220
but I'm over there as a guest.
He doesn't even have a second

707
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:40,220
controller.
And I,

708
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:41,240
uh,
so I,

709
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:46,241
I went on my phone when a postmates
target ps four controller,

710
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,740
the UFC two game.
They brought it was there in 20 minutes.

711
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,790
Twenty of my friend's house.
I don't even,

712
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,060
I don't even have a ps four.
I just wanted to play something

713
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:57,290
different.
They can do that.

714
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,320
They came through with with the UFC game
under control and we hooked that shit up

715
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:04,670
and then we went and we were playing
UFC.

716
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,870
How the hell did they do that?
It's because they.

717
00:33:06,871 --> 00:33:09,770
It's just basically a delivery.
You just use the posts.

718
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,250
It's not target.
It's postmates where as a person and

719
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:15,380
they are driving around in eight waiting
for orders.

720
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,580
Wow.
Yeah,

721
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,030
so I'll take that over and wolves.
Fuck yeah,

722
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,610
no,
I'm not saying that.

723
00:33:21,611 --> 00:33:22,051
I know.
I know.

724
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:22,760
I know.

725
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,130
Thinks is the best time to be alive ever
for sure,

726
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,100
but there's guys like you and this guy's
like a lot of my other friends and that

727
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,590
I'm just happy to know and happy to be
around and then there's a bunch of

728
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:37,340
people out there unfortunately,
and for them they've been exposed to

729
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:41,300
some bad ideas and they don't have the
best genetics and they're living in

730
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:44,060
somewhere that sucks and they get to
vote too.

731
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,990
Right.
I do see when I do,

732
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,513
I'll see.
I,

733
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,700
I'm,
I love reading comments on articles just

734
00:33:51,701 --> 00:33:56,701
to just to see is that real?
Is that a real human being that thinks

735
00:33:57,281 --> 00:34:02,281
that that's the date in fascinated all
the time where it hurts me and it makes

736
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,530
me happy.
At the same time,

737
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,640
I can't believe that I live on the same
earth.

738
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:10,840
Is that type of person that that thinks
that for real or a person that really

739
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:15,220
thinks that trump will be president.
A person that has these will trump could

740
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:15,950
use about that.

741
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,560
Right?
I mean it's halfway there.

742
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,000
He's the Republican nominee.

743
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,490
He is.
He's got a super far.

744
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,920
I don't think about that.
I don't think it's going to happen from

745
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:25,080
here.
The fact that he's gotten his closest

746
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:26,100
crazy.
It's crazy,

747
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,940
but I think those people that you're
talking about that you can't believe,

748
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:32,270
they think that way.
They're a product of whatever the fuck

749
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,870
happened to them in their world.
Like there's pockets of the world that

750
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:39,720
are all a mess right now and if you were
born in that pocket or I was born in

751
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,660
that pocket and the same sort of
circumstances.

752
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,250
That's one of the things that.
It's hard.

753
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:46,520
It's hard to recognize as a person.
You see someone's an asshole.

754
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:47,780
He just goes,
fucking asshole,

755
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:51,260
fuck them,
but in a way we kind of kind of look at

756
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:52,550
those people go,
damn,

757
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,450
they just got fucked.
They got born into a group of dummies

758
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,220
with a bunch of violent tendencies and
crime and bullshit and nonsense and this

759
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:04,410
is all they've ever known and they just
trying to get by and you know,

760
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,500
a guy like trump comes in

761
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,343
how long ago

762
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,510
and if it wasn't trump,
it could be a number of motivational

763
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:18,830
speakers all throughout the country that
might have nefarious intentions.

764
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
Yeah.
Anybody who's really like super

765
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:25,580
charismatic now it's kind of open game.
Like when a guy like trump can come

766
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:29,790
along and talk as much crazy shit as he
has and in,

767
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:34,370
in some ways I'm not opposed to him
women because in some ways I'm like,

768
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:37,350
look,
he has the best guy to fuck this system

769
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:40,470
in the ass and we know this system
sucks.

770
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,900
It's almost like this guy's a suicide
bomber.

771
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:48,170
Like trump's like this wild dude with a
vest and a sweaty face and he just run

772
00:35:48,261 --> 00:35:49,260
it into that cafe.

773
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,180
Boom.
Well,

774
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:56,190
he had a two party system is flawed
anyways.

775
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,940
I'm going to put that on a meme.
It could be more than two vbl able to

776
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:05,040
run short.
It should be.

777
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,410
She'd be a lot.
Do you know Tom Rhodes?

778
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,990
Yeah.
He was on Duncan trussell's podcast the

779
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:14,130
other day and he was talking about um,
the way it's set up in Holland.

780
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,840
Taylor seven?
Yeah.

781
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,000
Something.
Jamie see if he could find out how many

782
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,210
candidates they have,
how many parties rather than they have

783
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:22,320
in Holland,
but it's many,

784
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:23,154
many,
many,

785
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,550
and they're all like,
they're real reasonable like how they're

786
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:30,510
placed and there's,
I'm sure there's like a lot of us,

787
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:34,620
me included that we were upset because
there's some things on one side of that

788
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:37,980
I agree with some things on another side
I agree with and some things that aren't

789
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:39,240
being represented at all.

790
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,240
Like the idea that these two people and
whatever opinions they discussed,

791
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,610
the only opinions that we should all be
talking about.

792
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,650
That's crazy.
It's crazy.

793
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,100
Should be more.
Why can't they collaborate on that?

794
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,430
Trump is looking how many they have in
Holland.

795
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:57,590
This is crazy how many.
They have jamie 11,

796
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,120
but there's 17,
six,

797
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:01,950
seven.
Didn't vote in the 2012 elections,

798
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:04,650
so that might be brand new.
I'm not sure if they have 11 different

799
00:37:04,651 --> 00:37:07,410
parties voted in the last year.
They all had candidates.

800
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,400
Wow.
See that's.

801
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,430
That's right.
That's how it should be done.

802
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,350
We were getting hoodwinked by a group of
people that are just controlling this

803
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:20,550
ancient system and it's not a good
system and they know it's not a good

804
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:22,950
system,
but the only way you could ever stop

805
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:26,550
this system is you have to have people
with pure hearts and minds that are

806
00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:29,910
willing to admit the system sucks,
so they're going to lose whatever

807
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:34,140
position of influence that they have and
step back and be judged by the merit of

808
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:35,160
their own ideas.

809
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,050
Again,
instead of being a senator or

810
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,330
congressman or a president,
they just say,

811
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:40,860
look,
this system sucks.

812
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,570
It sucks.
I think it sucks.

813
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:47,250
Let's get to get the best legal scholars
and and people that understand human

814
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:52,251
nature and let's can conduct and compose
a system that works and let's really run

815
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:56,040
the government like it's one of us and
that we're all in this together.

816
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,410
These old folks don't realize that they
just,

817
00:37:58,411 --> 00:38:01,320
they just cling to power until they're
in the grave.

818
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,610
They just hang onto it like it's her
route.

819
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,910
Pancan over the abyss.
They know what they're going to drop

820
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,500
into it.
They don't want to let go,

821
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,230
oh,
well,

822
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,100
you need to control these independence.
Reduced the number of percentages they

823
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:16,410
have to.
That's just the way it's going to be,

824
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:18,550
man.
I'm fascinated by that.

825
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:23,590
Just the level of obviously we have egos
to what to do what we do,

826
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,710
but to one of run a country,
just the level,

827
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,090
dude,
if you can't take jokes,

828
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:32,610
he can't play basketball and you're not
really good at fighting.

829
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,830
You find a way to be special.
Parts of this are different.

830
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:42,160
It's a weird impulse,
different type of of pressure.

831
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,530
Here's the weirdest thing about that
impulse.

832
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,010
When you see someone out there in the
world,

833
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,600
when you see someone that you admire,
whether it's an athlete or a brilliant

834
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:56,090
scholar or whoever the fuck it is,
you see someone,

835
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,390
a musician,
you see some,

836
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,910
you really admire.
That person has accomplished something

837
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,150
amazing,
right?

838
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,550
All the president asked to do is get
people to like them,

839
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,810
right?
That's it.

840
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:13,080
Like Obama really didn't have a whole
lot of experience in the world,

841
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,280
like creating things or making things.
It went from being a lawyer to a

842
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:18,990
senator,

843
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,990
right?
Community activists and then state

844
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:26,360
senator in the Senate.
It mean.

845
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,690
And he got it.
I think.

846
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,300
I don't know if the state senate,
but he got it because uh,

847
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,340
he moved up because the dude had a sex
scandal in Illinois.

848
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,470
Oh,
that's right.

849
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,210
That's right.
And what does that do?

850
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,120
That's your state.
I forget who it was,

851
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,000
but he does not like,
like,

852
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,120
like pick a person,
like a,

853
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,230
you know,
some,

854
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,840
some great person in history that's done
something amazing and you,

855
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:53,270
you look at them and you're like,
wow,

856
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:58,010
I would love it if that great person of,
of wisdom and accomplishment if that

857
00:39:58,011 --> 00:39:59,730
person was step up and be president.
Yeah.

858
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:02,960
It doesn't necessarily have to be the
case in America.

859
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,980
All you have to do is just be liked.
Right?

860
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,220
That's Kinda crazy.

861
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,400
It is.
It is.

862
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,160
It is.
I don't even know.

863
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:17,190
I mean both Hillary and trump.
Art Seventy or 65.

864
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,940
Yeah.
They're telling you why are you doing

865
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:21,540
that?
Right.

866
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,540
Doing it.
People can dream but don't dream so big.

867
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,040
Dude.
You're 30 and you're thinking about

868
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:31,041
retiring 33.
I'm already buying hotels and picking

869
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:31,810
them up.

870
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:32,860
Strategy.
I'm thinking about.

871
00:40:32,861 --> 00:40:35,170
I'm a hundred percent because I like
this.

872
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:36,490
I like,
I enjoy this,

873
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:39,340
but I mean I see.
I see how I could go.

874
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,970
I just see how I look at how other
people have handled their moment and how

875
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:49,870
other people handled their finances and
I don't want to any part of that.

876
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:54,871
So I'm making every step.
Every thing I do everyday is about,

877
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:00,940
been super stable seven years from now
and comfortable and to have enough

878
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:01,720
passive income.

879
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,520
I don't have to worry about that.
That's very smart,

880
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:04,600
man.
Very smart.

881
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:06,790
And you're doing it like in a real
proactive way.

882
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,860
Not a whole lot of people look at it
that way.

883
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,780
Everybody else just sort of like rides
it out,

884
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,770
you know,
or it's a weird mindset,

885
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,480
right?
It's like the investment mindset is so

886
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:18,220
different than the creative mindset.
Yeah.

887
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,050
It's just,
just look,

888
00:41:21,051 --> 00:41:23,090
I mean it's just,
you know,

889
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:27,410
not just spending smart and just
researched a lot now and just,

890
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,120
you know,
shifting my internet time from the

891
00:41:29,121 --> 00:41:32,700
bullshit.
So just looking at properties and that's

892
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,670
smart to do something else,
man.

893
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:35,460
And just,
I,

894
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,210
I just don't,
I don't want to end up on those special.

895
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:44,310
He spent 2014 and the other that not a
real Hollywood story.

896
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,240
I don't want to be on some goofy ass
show that I don't want to be doing eight

897
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:55,160
years from now where you're like,
oh,

898
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:57,790
he definitely needed the money.
I don't want to do anything.

899
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,180
Isn't that a funny?
Don't want to say,

900
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,410
man,
that's a funny conversation because we

901
00:42:01,411 --> 00:42:03,570
all know what it's like.
Have you ever been in our bad show

902
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,730
on a badge?
Like a bad TV?

903
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,850
No,
not really.

904
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,370
I haven't done that much.
That many different TVS.

905
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:11,820
Just a bunch of

906
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,750
dudes out there right now working in
lumberyards,

907
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,630
driving trucks,
taken math,

908
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,250
trying to stay awake,
listening to us right now going,

909
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,750
you fucking bitches are complaining
about being a Shitty TV show.

910
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,160
Where do I sign up,
bro?

911
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,380
Fuck.
Do I sign up?

912
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,050
Get out of this job.
And you're right folks.

913
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,150
You're right.
You gotta you gotta humorous.

914
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,660
You got a humorous because I've been on
a bad show and uh,

915
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,330
I was on a show that was even,
was worse than a bad show.

916
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,880
Good show.
It turned into a bad show.

917
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,700
I was on the show called hardball and it
started out.

918
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:43,800
These guys who wrote it,
they wrote for the simpsons,

919
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:46,380
they wrote from married with children,
Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran,

920
00:42:46,381 --> 00:42:49,080
really smart guys and they,
um,

921
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,270
they wrote this hilarious pilot.
We did a,

922
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:54,450
Jim Brewer was in the pilot and I was in
the pilot and a bunch of other people

923
00:42:54,451 --> 00:42:56,580
that wind up doing,
doing a bunch of different movies and

924
00:42:56,581 --> 00:43:00,300
shit and it was a funny pilot and then
the network got ahold of it and they

925
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:02,550
just,
Oh fuck the shit out of it.

926
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:07,000
And they throw in some really hacky
producer who wound up getting he will.

927
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,980
He wound up getting fired like halfway
through the six episodes that we did and

928
00:43:10,981 --> 00:43:13,800
it was allegedly,
there was a bunch of other shit going on

929
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:16,960
and the writing was off the charts bad.
It was.

930
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,870
So I got to be like on a bad show,
but it's a terrible feeling for season.

931
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,390
Next six episodes six.
That was the first.

932
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,430
The first one was the pilot,
which was really funny.

933
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:28,980
And then it just was like,
all of a sudden it was over here doing

934
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:33,270
something that was terrible and you're
better off doing nothing than doing

935
00:43:33,271 --> 00:43:34,440
something you hate.
Yeah.

936
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:37,410
That doesn't make any sense because you
make money and ultimately it's worth

937
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:39,480
doing.
And ultimately for me it was definitely

938
00:43:39,481 --> 00:43:41,670
worth something because I learned from
the experience.

939
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:45,060
You can't just do a TV show.
You got to be sure.

940
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,580
And even if you're sure,
like the pilot was really funny.

941
00:43:47,581 --> 00:43:49,290
I was pretty sure that that would be
okay.

942
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:53,910
It doesn't matter because a bunch of
other factors can fall into place.

943
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:56,370
Yeah.
I just remembered I did do a bad show.

944
00:43:56,371 --> 00:43:57,930
Is My TV show last shit?

945
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,220
What happened with that?

946
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,110
It uh,
I think it mean we had our moments,

947
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:06,850
but it just,

948
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:10,390
it might need some more booze to get the
truth out of here with some ice.

949
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,440
It's just,
it had his moments,

950
00:44:15,441 --> 00:44:17,840
but we didn't,
we,

951
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,380
they came with the idea that came to me
and the producing comedy central.

952
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,950
It basically,
this is the show,

953
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:27,710
this idea.
Adam will do a sketches man on the

954
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:31,470
street stuff.
Just just figuring out the quest answers

955
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:34,050
to these questions,
but it's just,

956
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:37,470
I guess we didn't really focus it in
focus,

957
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:38,304
the,
uh,

958
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,140
the point of view and it was kind of all
over the place and we had our funny

959
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:45,510
moments and did some,
a couple of good sketches,

960
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:47,640
but it just,
by the end of it,

961
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:52,641
it didn't feel I wasn't excited anymore
those last two episodes where just,

962
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,410
you know,
and we do it in front of a live

963
00:44:55,411 --> 00:44:57,990
audience.
It really was just about finishing that

964
00:44:57,991 --> 00:45:00,430
shit man,
that man.

965
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,710
But I,
I'm happy I did it and that I had that

966
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:05,580
moment where,
you know,

967
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,730
for what,
what was that two months last year at my

968
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,860
own TV show.
Not a lot of people get to say that.

969
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,050
Uh,
but,

970
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:13,741
uh,
yeah,

971
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:14,700
it's just,
you know,

972
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,010
you learned a lot.
I learned a lot.

973
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,830
It was fun.
Got To work with some cool people.

974
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,800
But yeah,
it just wasn't as far as what I wanted

975
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:25,430
my first,
uh,

976
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,880
you know,
kind of headline and project to be a.

977
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,710
It wasn't that beautiful.
Jamison

978
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:35,140
and whiskey and nice just brought up,
um,

979
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,990
now what,
what were you trying to do and what went

980
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:40,420
wrong?
You know,

981
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,530
what my interviewer now give me,
give me some ice.

982
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:49,830
I sounded like Matt Lauer was like I do.
I just went into interview mode as I got

983
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:50,794
some ice.

984
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,440
I think I kind of went into it not,
you know,

985
00:45:55,070 --> 00:46:00,070
not really knowing.
I mean I learned later on how to run

986
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:06,110
things better and how to give people
direction on what I needed a little bit

987
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:08,000
better,
but I don't think we came in with a

988
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:13,001
focus because I was thinking with a TV
show that not that we would completely

989
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,420
winging it,
but that we would,

990
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:20,990
uh,
be able to kind of find it as we go.

991
00:46:20,991 --> 00:46:23,720
We never did a true pilot episode.
Cheers.

992
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:26,560
Cit.
We never did a true pilot episode.

993
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:31,810
I pilot episode was our premier episode
and I look at some of my choices.

994
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:37,530
I chose this weird ass closing bit on
there.

995
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,301
Well,
Oh,

996
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:40,520
why did I pick that as a bit?
I didn't write it,

997
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:43,640
but I liked it.
Sometimes you'd like stuff in the

998
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:47,540
writer's room that is hilarious,
and then you execute that shit.

999
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,460
And what were we doing?

1000
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,060
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

1001
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,700
Okay.
Outside of a television show,

1002
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,500
if you were just sitting around and
someone said,

1003
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:57,540
Hannibal,
I want you to just be your creative

1004
00:46:57,541 --> 00:47:00,450
self.
Would you ever gravitate towards writing

1005
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:01,284
sketches?

1006
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:03,170
What I gravitate towards,
right.

1007
00:47:03,171 --> 00:47:06,570
And Yeah,
just on your own.

1008
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:07,710
Oh my own.
No,

1009
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:12,000
but it was sometimes where I come up
with something that definitely works

1010
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,600
better visually than,
uh,

1011
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,280
than Stan does stand up.
Oh,

1012
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:20,810
I try to tell a standup bit like,
but it will work better,

1013
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:24,450
uh,
visually animated or as a sketch yet.

1014
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,461
Yeah,
definitely.

1015
00:47:25,461 --> 00:47:26,141
I agree.
There's,

1016
00:47:26,141 --> 00:47:28,040
there's,
there's some subjects that I've had an

1017
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,730
abandoned because they really did.
I thought they were hilarious,

1018
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:31,990
but I couldn't.
They just didn't,

1019
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:37,210
weren't there were a better idea for a
play than they would be for a standup

1020
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:38,044
comedy?
Yeah.

1021
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:42,640
But when we're coming up,
everybody wanted to be on Saturday night

1022
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:47,641
live because Eddie Murphy was on there.
Everybody wanted to be on sketch comedy

1023
00:47:47,771 --> 00:47:52,771
shows because that would lead to these
big careers like Adam Sandler and Rob

1024
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,230
Schneider and all these people that we
became like these huge movie stars,

1025
00:47:56,231 --> 00:47:59,890
right?
So we all like gravitate towards acting

1026
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:04,210
and then there was sitcoms where Rosanne
made all this money and then Seinfeld

1027
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:05,110
made all this money.
He's like,

1028
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:06,020
Oh shit,
I gotta get to.

1029
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,560
Yeah.
But when I was on that bad sitcom

1030
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:10,930
halfway and I was like,
this is not what I wanted to do.

1031
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,070
Right?
I fucked up.

1032
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,240
I listened to the I want to do stand up.
If it does what I want to do now with a

1033
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:19,210
guy like you,
like what I want to hear as you talk

1034
00:48:19,211 --> 00:48:22,840
about everything I don't want to hear.
I mean I want to hear you doing prepared

1035
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:24,580
shit.
If that's what you want to do.

1036
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,630
Like what I would want to hear from you.
If I was a producer and I was a network

1037
00:48:28,631 --> 00:48:30,760
and I was comedy central,
I would say handle,

1038
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:31,571
listen,
fuck.

1039
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:34,000
All these executives.
Fuck all these producers.

1040
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,000
What do you think is funny?
What do you want to do?

1041
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,370
I want to know.
I don't want a bunch of people filtering

1042
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,160
the Hannibal Vision by the time,
like when Doug,

1043
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:45,610
Stan hope and I did the man show,
which was a giant mistake.

1044
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:50,290
One of the big problems with was with
that show was like with Doug and I had a

1045
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:52,510
fucked up idea by the time it would get
to.

1046
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,170
It would be all watered down by the time
we'd ever get to the television.

1047
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,200
There's no way you could just have the
only way to do that.

1048
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:02,320
It's like the Internet.
The Internet is the only way where you

1049
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:05,020
could just like if someone was smart,
they would come along and they would

1050
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:05,854
say,
listen,

1051
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:09,430
if I was comedy central,
I would say animal.

1052
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:13,720
It's just like a bunch of money and
we're just going to give you a

1053
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:16,870
production team and just come up with
whatever the fuck you want to come up

1054
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,550
with.
I want you to take six months.

1055
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,790
Just think about what you want to do is.
I know it's going to be funny.

1056
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,790
I think you're hilarious.
I'll take six months,

1057
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,950
come up with whatever the fuck you want
to do,

1058
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:30,670
let's put this shit online,
do this,

1059
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:33,160
come on mobile.
And then if they wanted to make a

1060
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:35,340
television show out of that,
I mean that's what happened with Arisa

1061
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,193
fear show.

1062
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

1063
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:42,020
It will do it as the online thing.
And the honestly the online's better.

1064
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,890
It's better to get on the online.
No,

1065
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:46,990
it's going to online.
It's there always.

1066
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:50,800
Is there any minute of any day.
If it's just the TV version of it.

1067
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,250
I mean once it goes online then it
becomes equal to the online version,

1068
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:59,440
but there's no like loss and not having
the TV version because like if someone

1069
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:02,790
watches comedy central during the show,
when Ariz on like what is always

1070
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,760
ratings,
what did he get?

1071
00:50:03,761 --> 00:50:06,880
Like a million dollars an episode or a
million people in episode?

1072
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,470
A million dollars an episode.
He'd be very happy.

1073
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,590
It's crazy.
But if he got a million people an

1074
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,180
episode,
like you could easily,

1075
00:50:13,181 --> 00:50:16,690
if you had a crazy viral video like some
of Joey Diaz videos,

1076
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,620
they probably have close to a million.
Right?

1077
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,810
How many Joey's um,
things on a,

1078
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,030
this is not happening.
Have more than a million.

1079
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,220
Find out what Joey Diaz his stories on
this is not happening

1080
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,200
now.
I guarantee you they have a million

1081
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,690
people.
I mean it's just people don't watch it

1082
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:35,480
on their phone.
They could watch whatever they tell your

1083
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:36,314
friends.
Yeah.

1084
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:41,090
Yeah.
So if you did that and you had a show

1085
00:50:41,091 --> 00:50:42,740
like that,
it was just you.

1086
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,720
If you,
if you really want to do a show,

1087
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,380
just you doing whatever the fuck you
think is funny.

1088
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,143
Shit.

1089
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,780
I'd watch them and figure it out.
A dvr the shit out of that show.

1090
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,440
I'm going to figure it out.
I've been kind of.

1091
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:58,920
What do we got here?
That's us.

1092
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:01,660
What is this?
This is not happening.

1093
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,390
Joey Diaz.
One million.

1094
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:06,240
One hundred 29,000.
Four hundred 87 views.

1095
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,040
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah.

1096
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:11,070
I mean that's like,
that's real numbers man.

1097
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:14,850
I mean that's the same kind of numbers
you get if you have a TV show.

1098
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,610
It's the same shit,
right?

1099
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:19,950
Definitely.
It's real close,

1100
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:24,900
man.
We're like maybe a year or two away from

1101
00:51:24,901 --> 00:51:29,370
the idea of being on a television show
being no different than the idea of

1102
00:51:29,371 --> 00:51:32,640
being on a youtube show or even,
I mean,

1103
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:37,670
a lot of these,
I'm doing some celebrities react a shell

1104
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:41,140
on Thursday where they,
like,

1105
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:45,210
our viewership is four times the average
TV show,

1106
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,250
like the,
in the,

1107
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,150
in the email,
they,

1108
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:52,230
they talk about their numbers like this
two times and knowing what is four times

1109
00:51:52,231 --> 00:51:54,010
that is,
isn't it,

1110
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,520
didn't have a crazy subscriber list,
uh,

1111
00:51:56,521 --> 00:51:59,100
in all on youtube,
millions of subscribers.

1112
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,800
Youtube is where it's at for a lot of
things.

1113
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,750
It's just a matter of we just A.
I mean,

1114
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:08,751
that's how comedy central now judges the
success of that shows not just on the,

1115
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,150
on,
on air,

1116
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,080
the initial area,
it judge it based on the facebook

1117
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:18,000
shares,
the youtube stuff,

1118
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:21,550
the snapchat thing and all that's to
come.

1119
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:26,520
It's a combined a formula they use to
judge the successful show.

1120
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,140
It's smart.
I mean,

1121
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,570
that's really the way to think about it
because they have to be honest.

1122
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,570
This is a giant percentage of the people
that are gonna Watch her show on youtube

1123
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,850
or any other weather.
I mean,

1124
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,940
I don't know how many people watch
comedy central Dot Com.

1125
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:42,000
Do you know?
I would imagine it's not nearly as much

1126
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:45,570
as youtube,
but what's amazing about youtube is

1127
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:47,550
there's only one youtube.
Yeah,

1128
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,880
like how is there not a million youtube?
How is it not a million of these weird

1129
00:52:53,581 --> 00:52:58,581
websites where you can just upload video
anytime you want and watch the craziest

1130
00:52:58,771 --> 00:53:00,780
shit all day long.
I mean there's live leak,

1131
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:02,390
right?
There's a.

1132
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,500
What are the,
what are the other ones?

1133
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,670
A lot of weird ones that are,
that are based on.

1134
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,050
They're not popular.
Not why.

1135
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:09,000
Yeah.
Well because one popular one.

1136
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,480
If you say Google bought Youtube though,

1137
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,733
skynet

1138
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,450
hundred and $35.
Million Bucks is all that tape too.

1139
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,010
That's it for Youtube.
Yeah.

1140
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,250
That's good.
When did they buy?

1141
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,360
2,000.
Four or five.

1142
00:53:24,361 --> 00:53:26,040
I think.
How much does Kanye is entire

1143
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,040
sneaker line worth?
If he sold every sneaker,

1144
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:33,180
is that 100 million worth of pretty
close to that problem?

1145
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:34,250
That's probably pretty close.
Yeah.

1146
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,990
That's amazing.
That's how much they paid for that.

1147
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,960
For Youtube.
Youtube is a monster.

1148
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,800
Yeah.
It's somehow or another in this world of

1149
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:47,790
the Internet where there's probably like
what?

1150
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,280
How many hundreds of millions of
websites?

1151
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,890
I take that back side or correct that
one point six,

1152
00:53:52,891 --> 00:53:55,470
5 billion in stock now,
the owner's son of a bitch,

1153
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,330
Jesus Chamie.
Meanwhile,

1154
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,180
here's some perspective.
The UFC sold for 4 billion.

1155
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:09,370
It's more valuable to kick people in.
The deq and the head an elbow in the

1156
00:54:09,991 --> 00:54:13,110
face than it is to create youtube.

1157
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,080
Yeah,
I looked something up on it the other

1158
00:54:15,081 --> 00:54:16,490
day.
I think that's why there's numbers were

1159
00:54:16,491 --> 00:54:17,990
stuck in my head.
It's a,

1160
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,980
at least from what I read at cost,
something like six point $7,000,000,000

1161
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,530
to run youtube right now every year,
year.

1162
00:54:24,531 --> 00:54:26,750
And like the revenue they're getting my
baby just from ads.

1163
00:54:26,751 --> 00:54:29,630
It's like less than 5 billion.
So they're taking a loss on it.

1164
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:32,540
But why is,
that's just for doing the future bet.

1165
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:35,060
Kinda like it won't be that for four or
five more years.

1166
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:35,850
It's just how it happened.

1167
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,650
Oh,
so that's why there's only one youtube.

1168
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,370
It's fucking tough,
but

1169
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,250
that makes sense.
It's amazing though.

1170
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:47,670
I mean that's a.
If you want to talk about an incredible

1171
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:53,370
example of success,
like youtube is the only video upstream

1172
00:54:53,371 --> 00:54:57,990
place that everybody or upload place
that everybody recognizes instantly in

1173
00:54:57,991 --> 00:55:01,680
the sea of the Internet is a,
that's incredible.

1174
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,890
As top management.
They do do some shit.

1175
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,690
You do.
Do you do ads with them?

1176
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:07,640
No,
no,

1177
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,720
I mean they put up ads but I don't have
anything to do with it.

1178
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:13,350
Um,
we do just adds on this show and then we

1179
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,450
upload the,
the difference between the Youtube

1180
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,030
version of this show and the podcast
version.

1181
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,310
The podcast version has,
um,

1182
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:21,773
has,
uh,

1183
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,780
uh,
adds that we read,

1184
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,510
you know,
like from,

1185
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:27,660
um,
a promo,

1186
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:31,440
a email thing,
and then the youtube one has no ads.

1187
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:32,460
It just goes up.

1188
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,650
And then whatever ads,
youtube ads and ads for.

1189
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,500
I took someone with a on it Zealand,
I think I'm feeling,

1190
00:55:40,501 --> 00:55:41,450
I don't know,
maybe the,

1191
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:46,080
the whiskey is cancelling it out,
but maybe I'm just normal now.

1192
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:47,820
I'm feeling a little drunk.
I'm good.

1193
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,610
Yeah,
I'm just not going to help the drunk too

1194
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:53,250
much.
Maybe it'll help you formulate

1195
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:54,360
sentences.
Meanwhile,

1196
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,770
the word formulate came out.
Very clumsy.

1197
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,890
Formulate.
You ever been to Israel?

1198
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:04,380
No.
Have you know?

1199
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,470
Hmm.
I got offered a Gig and Israel don't go

1200
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:09,590
in June.
Reactionary.

1201
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,040
I don't know.
You should go to.

1202
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,160
Sure you took it.
I took the Gig.

1203
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,740
Um,
when is it for?

1204
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,860
It was supposed to be in Gillette.
Supposed to be spoiler alert

1205
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,290
on earth lead,

1206
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,820
but still an interesting story.
I so took this gig in Israel in Tel Aviv

1207
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:36,400
only because my ex girlfriend is Israeli
is Israeli.

1208
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,380
And so I'm thinking,
fuck,

1209
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:41,210
you have a machine gun in your mouth?
No,

1210
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:47,580
she's
Israeli.

1211
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,120
I'm thinking,
Hey,

1212
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,910
maybe she wants to come on this trip
with me.

1213
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,890
You know what I mean?
I'll take this,

1214
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:58,950
I'll take this and a well.
And then I took the Gig,

1215
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,210
turns out she was mad because he was
like,

1216
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:03,850
you didn't go to Tel Aviv with me when
we were together.

1217
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,540
So now I got this Gig in Tel Aviv,
this not even routed with anything else.

1218
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,830
And then I started getting these tweets
when people,

1219
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:18,370
why are you going to Tel Aviv?
Do you know what they're doing to the

1220
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:22,410
Palestinian people supporting genocide?
I'm like,

1221
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,520
I was just trying to get back on my ex
girlfriend.

1222
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:29,530
Be like,
you are supporting hate.

1223
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,130
You put the support and the Zionist.
I'm like,

1224
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,950
I didn't know.
I just heard he was dope beaches.

1225
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:41,370
I was getting all these.
And they like,

1226
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,730
why?
Why would you do this?

1227
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:47,350
Join these other artists that are
boycotting Israel.

1228
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,070
Is that common a boy?
I think it was like I live.

1229
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:53,110
I think it was,
it was a bunch of other people that

1230
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,830
won't tour vanilla ice,
vanilla ice.

1231
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,360
Uh,
Craig Zappa.

1232
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:00,320
Uh,
Craig Mac.

1233
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:00,881
Yeah,
correct.

1234
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:02,480
Mac.
Ellen Degeneres,

1235
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,800
a g depth.
A Little Wayne and lot of people bet

1236
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:10,710
midler won't go over there.
Oh my God.

1237
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,630
But yeah.
So it was just fun and getting all of

1238
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,760
these angry political tweets.
Okay.

1239
00:58:15,761 --> 00:58:17,410
That is fucked up.
What's going on over there?

1240
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:21,340
But that's not.
Can I be sympathetic and also maybe do

1241
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:22,840
this gig.
I ended up canceling Gig,

1242
00:58:22,841 --> 00:58:27,841
but now because of the tweets and the
anger was just because I booked a movie

1243
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:28,960
that completely with it,

1244
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:31,700
the movie was more important than in the
motherland.

1245
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,350
But let me ask you this.
Honestly.

1246
00:58:33,351 --> 00:58:36,320
If the girl was going to go with you,
he knew you're going to get your freak

1247
00:58:36,321 --> 00:58:38,180
on.
Would you have taken the Gig over the

1248
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,030
movie?
Have you?

1249
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:42,890
Would you have broken her heart and not
taking her back to the motherland?

1250
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,380
I wouldn't send the back another time.
Another time.

1251
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,360
Move a gentlemen.
See not.

1252
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:49,430
It's over bitch.
Sorry you missed it.

1253
00:58:49,431 --> 00:58:54,431
I'm on fast and furious.
Fifty 6,000 girl.

1254
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:00,080
I'll be so pissed for a dude.
Broke my crazy trip to Israel for fast

1255
00:59:00,081 --> 00:59:03,920
and the furious 56 to do three,
three lines in it.

1256
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,970
Fuck you.
And Fuck.

1257
00:59:04,971 --> 00:59:06,810
Vin Diesel.
Fuck you.

1258
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,730
Get run over by a charger
and

1259
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,190
that's a good move though.
Take her another time.

1260
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,260
But did you guys communicate afterwards?
Did you settle down to the issue that

1261
00:59:21,261 --> 00:59:22,100
you never took her to go

1262
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,090
to Israel?
Why you guys settled?

1263
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:28,880
I don't think that is some issues you a
you can't settle down and you just work

1264
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:30,620
on what you can work on.
Again,

1265
00:59:30,621 --> 00:59:34,280
let me bring this up.
Recreational outrage and let me pose a

1266
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:35,330
scenario.
Okay.

1267
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,780
Here's the scenario.
You two are living in a cave.

1268
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,600
Okay.
And a bear to say her sister and you

1269
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,150
guys saw it and he escaped and you,
you,

1270
00:59:45,151 --> 00:59:49,900
you fought off the bear's friends with a
spear and you made the best friends.

1271
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:54,410
Other than 500,000 years ago,
handle a $500.

1272
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:59,240
Where the other barriers,
other barriers instead of friends?

1273
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:02,010
I'm making it up as I go a little bit.
Made it sound like when you said the vas

1274
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:05,800
for hasn't made it sound like it could
be like a direct where the animals,

1275
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,230
that's it.
Good.

1276
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:08,240
This other big.
Don't think bears a friend was anything

1277
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:11,030
they can eat,
but I just assume it's parents,

1278
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:12,200
friends,
just other bears.

1279
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,460
It's another.
I'm so sorry.

1280
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:18,490
You make a really good point.
So you're managing to save this girl

1281
01:00:18,621 --> 01:00:22,850
from being predated upon by these
monsters.

1282
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,970
Just giant monsters.
You fight them off and you get her up to

1283
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:30,971
a top case carrier over your shoulders.
You lay her down on the landscape.

1284
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:33,110
Yes,
unscathed,

1285
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:34,290
but her sisters debt.
Yeah,

1286
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:35,050
and you,
you,

1287
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:39,390
you lay her down on the skins of a bear
that you have also killed yourself with

1288
01:00:39,391 --> 01:00:41,570
a fucking spirit.
Had a separate system with a separate

1289
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,560
situation.
This is all clean every day.

1290
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,800
Yeah.
She's not going to complain about you

1291
01:00:45,801 --> 01:00:50,801
not taking her to the motherland,
to Israel when you guys were dating.

1292
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,260
She's not going to give a fuck because
the stakes are much higher.

1293
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,810
This is you,
your hero.

1294
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,220
You've saved her physical entity.
You've said to her soul,

1295
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:04,490
from passing on to the next generation
of doubt,

1296
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:09,680
this beyond land where no one knows what
the fuck is really going on and you get

1297
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:10,310
glimpses.

1298
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,980
If you take mushrooms,
you stick your head and you pop it back

1299
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:17,510
and you never really quite sure whether
or not whether you saw whatever you saw

1300
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:21,080
was real.
Then you would fuck her on that fucking

1301
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:22,940
rug.
But meanwhile,

1302
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,033
yeah,
you would.

1303
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,280
You'd fucker.
You'd be happy.

1304
01:01:28,281 --> 01:01:32,360
She'd be happy for saving her life and
maybe not her sister.

1305
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,980
How about a cousin?
Her cousin who was kind of Cunty,

1306
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:38,240
her cousin who was fat and big shed
giant ankles,

1307
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:40,880
and she hated her whole life because she
had shitty genetics.

1308
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,620
She got pink hair.
She likes to bully small boys.

1309
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:49,770
How about that girl?
Maybe you'd have to ask her.

1310
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:54,080
Can imagine if that was the case in the.
In the cave people community.

1311
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:56,570
There was this one girl was like cock
blocker.

1312
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,550
She had rules.
She's like,

1313
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:03,670
I can't fuck you because my friends tell
we all have a role when we go back to a

1314
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:06,530
room.
We just,

1315
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:09,590
we just can't do it.
I can't fuck a guy on the first date,

1316
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,830
first date,
only after he's built at least seven

1317
01:02:12,831 --> 01:02:15,480
fires for,
you know,

1318
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,120
so sad.
So sad.

1319
01:02:17,121 --> 01:02:19,920
People not being able to be themselves
because they met so many people along

1320
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:20,040
the

1321
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,480
way that weren't themselves.
And they're like,

1322
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:23,280
God damn it.
I can't show you yet.

1323
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:26,160
Yeah.
I can't take off my Kabuki mask and show

1324
01:02:26,161 --> 01:02:28,170
you the soul.
Eternal self.

1325
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:33,140
Yeah,
I do.

1326
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,630
Sometimes I,
uh,

1327
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,331
this,
uh,

1328
01:02:36,331 --> 01:02:39,660
it was this waitress at the,
uh,

1329
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,350
at,
at the Darra smoke a joint.

1330
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,000
His restaurant is a good store,
I can tell.

1331
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,280
And,
and she was,

1332
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:49,500
uh,
she was beautiful when I was hanging out

1333
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:53,950
with my friend in vegas that she's cool
with,

1334
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:58,500
you know,
I can openly talk about other women with

1335
01:02:58,501 --> 01:03:00,160
her while she was like,
yes,

1336
01:03:00,161 --> 01:03:02,640
she's beautiful.
She's and this waitress,

1337
01:03:02,641 --> 01:03:07,641
she was so aka lesbian,
I don't know if that's the word,

1338
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:13,970
but this wages was so beautiful.
You ever meet a waitress way?

1339
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,170
She'd be playing like the superfly sound
dry.

1340
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,430
Do you haven't meet a wages where you
shouldn't be a waitress?

1341
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,010
It was,
she,

1342
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:29,610
it wasn't about her looks.
She just had a sort of composure to,

1343
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:31,530
uh,
just kinda restrained.

1344
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,900
She was beautiful,
but still,

1345
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:38,530
she doesn't know yet that people will
look at you weird if you're a waitress.

1346
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,620
That's what it is.
She's a young person who doesn't

1347
01:03:41,621 --> 01:03:45,440
understand and if she's lucky,
she meets a guy like Hannibal burress

1348
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,380
who doesn't judge her for the fact that
she,

1349
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,210
when she brought me in a bill,
I wanted to say,

1350
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:56,380
I want to say,
what are your dreams and how can I help

1351
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,233
with them?

1352
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,250
Wow.
Did you say?

1353
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,140
No?
I didn't say why you didn't say it

1354
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,360
because we don't hang out enough.
But if I was right next to you and be

1355
01:04:04,361 --> 01:04:05,000
like,
dude,

1356
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,780
it was the same time.
Let this shit go.

1357
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,330
Fuck it.
Who gives a fuck?

1358
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:11,103
Do you miss her?

1359
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:13,340
I uh,
I don't miss it.

1360
01:04:13,341 --> 01:04:15,810
No,
but I know where she is.

1361
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,030
I know she's in.
She's in Vegas.

1362
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,950
How long ago was this?
This was a,

1363
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,820
this was yesterday.
You should go back to Vegas.

1364
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,780
Are done.
Fly back.

1365
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:29,330
But you know why I didn't.
Uh,

1366
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:32,440
she,
she knew who I was and you know,

1367
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:37,050
I was at.
I didn't want her having to sit with my

1368
01:04:37,051 --> 01:04:39,870
weird energy for the rest.
She had to work her shift after my

1369
01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:42,050
weird,
intense energy on it.

1370
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:44,370
So I didn't want to leave that stink on
it for the rest of the day.

1371
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,920
Oh.
So that might be me overestimating my

1372
01:04:46,921 --> 01:04:49,590
effect on people,
but you know what I mean,

1373
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:53,160
that's very honest with you because she
don't need that.

1374
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:55,920
That's really honest.
Again,

1375
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:58,620
Kudos.
Eight plus eight plus for handling that

1376
01:04:58,621 --> 01:04:59,940
weirdness.
Yeah.

1377
01:04:59,941 --> 01:05:02,310
What do you do?
I mean maybe she wasn't in you at all.

1378
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:06,180
Just thought were really funny
most of the time.

1379
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:07,520
A lot of the time.
A lot of time.

1380
01:05:07,521 --> 01:05:10,650
When was the fans they own nothing else
besides that.

1381
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:13,320
And that's fine too.
I get,

1382
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:17,530
I get sometimes girls happened to dm on
instagram and it'll say,

1383
01:05:17,531 --> 01:05:18,364
hey,
you wanna

1384
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:23,460
meet up and have a drink and I'll just,
uh,

1385
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:27,600
sometimes depending on my mood,
I said you try to get the pipe just to,

1386
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:34,980
just to see what the tone is
because that's what a,

1387
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:41,250
that's a reference to a Jr Smith for
basketball player.

1388
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,470
Like some girl posted up,
a

1389
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:49,540
girl posted up his dog.
So I'll say that sometimes

1390
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,950
man amongst men.
How about him for president?

1391
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:55,990
Run,
run.

1392
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:58,510
But I'll just say that sometimes because
also I don't want.

1393
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,600
It's funny.
I think that's right.

1394
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:04,250
I think is whack for a girl just coming
my dm.

1395
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,380
Yeah,
that's A.

1396
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,640
Oh my God.
That's brilliant.

1397
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:10,370
So I stole that.
Familiar with what you're trying to get

1398
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,950
the pipe.
Holy Shit.

1399
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:17,050
And that girl blew him up tonight.
Dope Smiley face.

1400
01:06:17,051 --> 01:06:18,040
I'm a Whoa,
look.

1401
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:20,260
How weird is it?
You could see him,

1402
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:21,940
but her face is blurred out.
Yeah.

1403
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:26,110
We should all be able to see both
parties.

1404
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:29,320
If you want to put this up,
you can't hide the darkness.

1405
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,210
We should be able to know who you are
too.

1406
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:35,020
That's a weird thing to do.
But uh,

1407
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:35,701
yeah.
So.

1408
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:38,520
So I'd like to set the tone sometimes
just to see,

1409
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:43,550
because I like that word too.
[inaudible] girls hit me regular style

1410
01:06:44,191 --> 01:06:44,771
and just say,
Hey,

1411
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:46,570
you want to grab drinks?
What?

1412
01:06:46,571 --> 01:06:49,300
You just hit me up the same way you talk
to your friend.

1413
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:50,770
Hey,
you want to grab drinks?

1414
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,260
Oh their shoes.
Say something better to me.

1415
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:56,350
I'm a famous comedian.
Say something clever.

1416
01:06:56,870 --> 01:07:00,340
Send a pic or your pussy some cities or
some Jesus.

1417
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:03,310
Don't just say you want to grab drinks
like this is a.

1418
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:05,590
This is not a.
This is not a normal situation.

1419
01:07:05,591 --> 01:07:07,390
If it was normal,
you wouldn't be hitting me like this.

1420
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,150
So say something better.
I see your point,

1421
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,860
but they don't want to.

1422
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:14,190
Let's think about their point.
Their point.

1423
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:16,030
I know what that point is.
They want to play a casual.

1424
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:18,700
They want to play it cool.
They want to keep some innuendo and keep

1425
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:22,540
it subtle and I get that and sometimes I
play along with that Shit Shit to say.

1426
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:23,740
Sure.
Let's grab a drink,

1427
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:28,140
grab a drink and I'll go through with it
and then when everything goes down I

1428
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:31,600
wanted to go down but sometimes I just
want to hear you say it.

1429
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,490
I want to see you say it right?
Yeah,

1430
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:37,180
I hear what you're saying.
You're saying that you have sexual

1431
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:41,800
attraction to them and you want to be
sure if this shit goes any further,

1432
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:45,670
that this isn't just some weird
celebrity thing which ends up being

1433
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:46,840
something because sometimes they be
like,

1434
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:47,591
no,
I don't want to.

1435
01:07:47,591 --> 01:07:49,090
Fuck.
I just want to hang out with one of the

1436
01:07:49,091 --> 01:07:50,490
funniest guys around.
Well,

1437
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,720
you know what?
I'm only in this town for a night.

1438
01:07:52,721 --> 01:07:57,721
I don't want to have drinks with a fan.
Just casual platonic as drinks.

1439
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:02,750
I think you should value my time warner
or here's the other Po.

1440
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:07,480
The other possible point of view,
they don't understand why they're even

1441
01:08:07,481 --> 01:08:10,030
attracted to you.
They just know they are.

1442
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:12,430
Yeah,
they know the funny going on.

1443
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:14,040
They know that the,
the.

1444
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:16,100
You're hilarious.
They know

1445
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,800
that you're smart as fuck.
They're drawn to you.

1446
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:22,580
They're confused.
They can't believe they're in contact

1447
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:24,210
with a celebrity.
Not necessarily.

1448
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,350
I have to accept the DMV.
I know,

1449
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,720
but they're in contact with.
You

1450
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:33,070
see a lot of times and I.
it's something that I've accepted that

1451
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:34,010
sometimes they just want to,

1452
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:35,880
they want to hang out for the fucking
Brac.

1453
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:41,720
This one chick
yo at in Athens,

1454
01:08:42,721 --> 01:08:43,530
Georgia.
I use,

1455
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:47,160
I use dating apps sometimes and I use
bumble,

1456
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:50,010
bumble.
What is your profile so we can get your

1457
01:08:50,011 --> 01:08:51,180
lead?
It's just A.

1458
01:08:51,181 --> 01:08:53,370
I deleted it actually recently.
Oh girls.

1459
01:08:53,371 --> 01:08:55,860
Because I was like,
I deleted it because I was like,

1460
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:57,060
ah,
this is too much.

1461
01:08:57,061 --> 01:08:59,490
There's too much going on.
So this chicken,

1462
01:08:59,491 --> 01:09:01,230
Athens,
Athens,

1463
01:09:01,231 --> 01:09:01,891
Georgia,
Athens,

1464
01:09:01,891 --> 01:09:04,920
Georgia has come through the room.
I think that's where forrest Griffin's

1465
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:07,440
from.
She come to the room about.

1466
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:11,280
I'd never met her.
I uh,

1467
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:16,110
she come through hotel like four.
We go over to the hotel bar,

1468
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:17,940
grab a beer,
come right to the room.

1469
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:21,710
It's kind of stiff and awkward,
but she's kind of there for and uh,

1470
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:26,540
ended up having,
we have sex and uh,

1471
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:32,450
it was pretty quick.
She's about to leave the room and I see

1472
01:09:33,751 --> 01:09:35,940
you later.
I got a towel around my waist.

1473
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:38,010
She's like,
Eh,

1474
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,110
can we take a picture real quick?
Like,

1475
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:44,690
no,
they get no fucking post sex.

1476
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:48,030
Seth posts,
groupie sex selfie.

1477
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:50,100
What are you,
what world do you live in?

1478
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,560
Just fucking take this story with you
and get Outta here.

1479
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:56,850
I'm not getting a Selfie,
but I make bad decisions all the time.

1480
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:00,120
I feel like we should have a commercial
break.

1481
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,220
I don't know how to deal one yet.
We can't splice in commercials.

1482
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,800
You know?
I think,

1483
01:10:11,801 --> 01:10:14,710
uh,
it's hard being a Groupie,

1484
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,260
just like it's hard being handled burse
it's,

1485
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:18,820
it,
it's hard.

1486
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:23,850
It's hard being a person in person.
Navigating these waters is weird waters

1487
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:26,050
for,
for everybody.

1488
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,180
And I can,
I get the energy is bad.

1489
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,880
Something that bad,
but just as a,

1490
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:31,310
you know,
what's weird thing,

1491
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:33,740
here's what's weird.
People don't even know why they're

1492
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,070
attracted to certain people.
Didn't understand it,

1493
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,110
you know,
and they try to quantify it.

1494
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,510
I think,
uh,

1495
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,220
you know,
there's some people that are attracted

1496
01:10:42,221 --> 01:10:45,520
to people in weird ways and then they
almost want to test the waters.

1497
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:46,780
I want to meet you,
Hannibal.

1498
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:48,970
I don't think it's even.
I don't think it's attractive.

1499
01:10:48,971 --> 01:10:50,950
I think it's,
I think it's a straight up.

1500
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:55,080
Sometimes it's attracted and then
sometimes it's just straight up your

1501
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:57,850
personal television.
Your personal stage could be that you

1502
01:10:57,851 --> 01:10:59,860
have to the,
but there are a lot of them were like

1503
01:10:59,861 --> 01:11:01,300
really young,
you know,

1504
01:11:01,301 --> 01:11:05,110
if a person's 24 years old,
how much do they really understand

1505
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:08,610
completely about their motivations.
Right.

1506
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:11,570
You know,
or when someone's 22 w,

1507
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,340
w you're doing,
a lot of times it's like on instinct

1508
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,030
and then you're sort of self correcting
as you go along,

1509
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,073
you know?
Yeah.

1510
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:26,210
Does that make any sense?
You just do.

1511
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:31,030
I mean made still occasionally make
decisions.

1512
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,170
Whatever.
What the.

1513
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,083
Yeah,
of course.

1514
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:36,380
Why did I let that person in my
apartment?

1515
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:38,300
You drink.
I should've gotten a hotel room.

1516
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,780
It's the drinking drank and God dammit,
we're drunk right now.

1517
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:47,580
I'm going to say I'm drunk at buzz buzz.
These are big gas drinks I poured and

1518
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:51,980
this is really not smart.
Put this on the Internet about to.

1519
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,840
We're about to give them beamed up,
man

1520
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,550
up and clipped up.
Clip it up.

1521
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:00,980
We can handle this together.
They going to say we're going to be

1522
01:12:00,981 --> 01:12:03,980
pilot and copilot massaging this
comedian,

1523
01:12:03,981 --> 01:12:05,180
Hannibal burress

1524
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,770
dude,
your unfiltered and everybody wants to

1525
01:12:09,771 --> 01:12:12,040
be unfiltered,
but nobody wants unfiltered.

1526
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:14,030
Yeah.
Nobody wants unfiltered,

1527
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,630
but there's a lot of people that don't
want unfiltered and they want you to

1528
01:12:17,631 --> 01:12:21,680
think that nobody wants unfilter yeah.
Like you're not saying anything that I

1529
01:12:21,681 --> 01:12:24,680
wouldn't expect you to say.
If we were alone and the microphones

1530
01:12:24,681 --> 01:12:27,190
were off of you and I were hanging out
at the comedy store,

1531
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:30,170
we'd have the same conversation.
I'd be laughed at the exact same way.

1532
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,180
Actually we would because it be a bunch
of other comedians,

1533
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:38,130
ear hustling and I went into just them.
But you'll tell it online.

1534
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:38,671
Oh,
what it is.

1535
01:12:38,671 --> 01:12:39,570
It's not.
It's not.

1536
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:41,820
I'm more like this doesn't.
It does seem.

1537
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:45,840
It seems even though obviously it's way
more people listening and watching,

1538
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:48,720
but it's more about the visual of other
people.

1539
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,060
Like you know,
you having a conversation with somebody

1540
01:12:51,061 --> 01:12:53,800
and then you feel other people.
That's not part of the conversation

1541
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:59,760
where that feels more unnatural to me
than doing this.

1542
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,220
You know what I'm saying?
I agree a thousand percent.

1543
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,990
Yeah,
and it probably doesn't make any sense.

1544
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:07,230
It doesn't make sense.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

1545
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,040
It.
That's why it's like

1546
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:13,840
I think like it's not their fault if
someone's hanging around us.

1547
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:19,300
There's been situations like that before
where someone is like weaseled into a

1548
01:13:19,301 --> 01:13:23,650
conversation between me or you or me.
It was me and des and some other dude

1549
01:13:23,651 --> 01:13:27,550
the other night and this guy came up to
us and just sandwiches way into a

1550
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,490
conversation in the kitchen.
I'm like,

1551
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,540
how'd you get back here?
Come on man.

1552
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,270
Like,
but part of me,

1553
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,950
part of me thinks like if I was that
guy,

1554
01:13:37,951 --> 01:13:41,220
how would I do it?
What do you do if you walk up,

1555
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:42,980
you know,
you,

1556
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:45,660
you were at the comedy store,
you're supposed to go left to take a

1557
01:13:45,661 --> 01:13:50,661
leak and you go right and you're into
the kitchen and Joey Diaz is talking to

1558
01:13:51,631 --> 01:13:56,520
Ari Shaffir and Hannibal and you guys
were all hanging out and hilarious

1559
01:13:56,521 --> 01:14:00,720
fucking stories are being told and you
just want to stand there and stare.

1560
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:02,990
Yeah.
You want to.

1561
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:04,400
I mean you listen to it.

1562
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,210
I would do it right now.
I'll do it right now if those guys hated

1563
01:14:07,211 --> 01:14:10,090
me for some reason,
those guys wouldn't be my friends

1564
01:14:10,091 --> 01:14:10,840
anymore.
I'm like,

1565
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,010
I don't know what the fuck I did,
but

1566
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,930
damn,
I got to find a hole in this vent so I

1567
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:15,400
could listen in on and talk

1568
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:20,680
two and a lot of weight is interacts as
I had lit a fad,

1569
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:26,010
which I have a lot because I go out a
lot and go drinking and so I'm super

1570
01:14:27,311 --> 01:14:30,160
exposed to all the time.
Uh,

1571
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,880
but I was in Chattanooga last year.
We played this venue and we go out

1572
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:40,390
afterwards.
Me,

1573
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,550
my sugar,
Al Jackson,

1574
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:44,740
I'm a boy.
Marcus,

1575
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,370
a couple of girls we met and we go to
this bar,

1576
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:51,700
nice bar.
Not that many people that maybe 12,

1577
01:14:51,701 --> 01:14:55,120
15 people in the whole bar this big as
pool tables over on this side.

1578
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:58,180
Bars here.
They had these wings.

1579
01:14:58,181 --> 01:15:00,880
They,
these smoked wings that I was eating

1580
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,070
maybe the best ways I've had top five,
like I'm crushing them.

1581
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:09,040
It was a spiritual experience.
What's so good about them?

1582
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,500
They just well made.
They were grilled.

1583
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:14,870
They were cooked well,
I wish I remember the name was,

1584
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:17,140
but it was,
the wings were so good ground.

1585
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:19,900
I'm just killing these wing,
marinated in the zone.

1586
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:21,790
Maybe marinated,
had good sauce.

1587
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,380
Hot.
You like spicy?

1588
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,090
I like spicy.
I don't remember if he,

1589
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:28,900
but I'm destroying these winnings and
I'm in the zone.

1590
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:30,490
Like it's,
it's like,

1591
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,190
um,

1592
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:33,170
I think it was NBA

1593
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,450
exam.
I was on fire and then this dude comes

1594
01:15:36,451 --> 01:15:37,284
up,
man.

1595
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:38,310
Hey,
I was at the show.

1596
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:39,920
Uh,
can I take a picture with you?

1597
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:41,280
I'm saying yeah man.
Just A.

1598
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,260
I'm eating wings right.
I'm eating right now.

1599
01:15:43,261 --> 01:15:45,810
Let's just give me a few minutes.
I'm happy to take a picture.

1600
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,471
He's like,
come on man,

1601
01:15:46,471 --> 01:15:47,650
let me take a picture.
I was just telling me,

1602
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:49,350
man,
I'm eating right now.

1603
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:51,030
Let me,
let me just finish eating.

1604
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:53,970
And he said,
would you rather me take a wing or take

1605
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:55,590
a picture?
And I said,

1606
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:57,660
I'd rather you get the fuck out of my
face.

1607
01:15:57,661 --> 01:16:01,710
Right.
I told you because he pushed.

1608
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:03,960
He was,
it wasn't a crowded bar.

1609
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:08,160
It wasn't like a meet and greet.
I told him I was happy to take a picture

1610
01:16:08,161 --> 01:16:09,630
with them afterwards.
Just let me finish my.

1611
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,550
I had sauce all over my hands and shit.

1612
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:13,020
It's like they'll give it a few
reasonable.

1613
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,430
Give me a few minutes.
He asked.

1614
01:16:15,431 --> 01:16:18,840
Cool.
He asked cooler and I'm reasonable about

1615
01:16:18,841 --> 01:16:21,490
it and shit,
but you know a little bit.

1616
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:25,440
I know he's doing a bunch about it,
so on the other side of the bar,

1617
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:28,450
it's another bigger space with the where
the bathroom is.

1618
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:33,480
So I go to the bathroom and I step out
coincidentally who's at the bathroom.

1619
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:37,680
I walked.
He don't say nothing.

1620
01:16:37,681 --> 01:16:41,700
I walked past them and then it's a.
it's a long space is before you get to

1621
01:16:41,701 --> 01:16:44,550
the interest of the bar again and I get
there.

1622
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:46,650
He's standing by the bathroom door.
He yells,

1623
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,860
thought you were cool.
Hannibal thought you were cool.

1624
01:16:49,861 --> 01:16:54,030
You act like an asshole.
I paid $25 for your show.

1625
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,880
You you're acting like you're Dave
Chappelle or some shit.

1626
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:57,820
And

1627
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:02,820
Hellen Kevin Hart and how many days span
between stories far apart from each

1628
01:17:03,971 --> 01:17:06,240
other,
but it's a goat to where people want to

1629
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:08,250
try.
You try to bring up,

1630
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:09,810
right?
Yeah.

1631
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:10,060
You

1632
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:13,060
take your Dave pick up those stories.
Me motherfucker.

1633
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,260
Right?
Basically he said,

1634
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:18,500
hey,
if Dave Chappelle was mean to me when I

1635
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:20,300
had kept bothering him while he was
eating,

1636
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,540
I'd get it,
but you,

1637
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,160
you have to give me your day day span.
I was like,

1638
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:27,530
fuck you.
You paid for a show.

1639
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:30,230
You didn't pay for fucking meet and
greet.

1640
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:34,490
I told you I take the fucking picture
with you after I was done eating.

1641
01:17:34,491 --> 01:17:39,350
Then you kept pressing me and so he
bitched about the $25 or whatever.

1642
01:17:39,351 --> 01:17:42,490
Now I'm like sitting and stewing,
man about.

1643
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:43,760
I'm at the bottom.
This motherfucker.

1644
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:46,040
I told him I'd take a picture with this
barn even crowded.

1645
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,990
It would have been easier to take a
picture with her if he just fucking

1646
01:17:47,991 --> 01:17:52,991
relax and then I can take $25 out of my
pocket.

1647
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:57,090
I balled it up.
He's over at the pool table.

1648
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,610
I woke up and I throw it out,
take your money back if that's what you

1649
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:03,220
wanted,
and then he picked.

1650
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,820
He throws it back everything.
I balled it up,

1651
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,150
hit him in the face with it.
Oh my goodness.

1652
01:18:07,151 --> 01:18:09,470
And then they were ready to fight and I
was ready to fight the dude,

1653
01:18:09,471 --> 01:18:12,200
but then his brother was there and while
this was all going on,

1654
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:13,580
I'd be like,
where's the exit?

1655
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,500
Who's wearing clothes where I can't tell
if they have a gun.

1656
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,800
And then his friends going on that is
fred.

1657
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:25,190
I was ready to punch dude acts and then
his friend pulled out a camera phone

1658
01:18:25,191 --> 01:18:25,551
like,
oh,

1659
01:18:25,551 --> 01:18:27,260
your publisher is gonna love this.
And I'm like,

1660
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:30,260
I guess we're not fighting it by you're
ready to fight.

1661
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,580
Come on.
Twenty five bucks.

1662
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,530
It wasn't about the 25 bucks.
It was about,

1663
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:37,310
about the words about to just talk and
shit and just acting like I wasn't.

1664
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,670
I was being totally chill in and saying,
Hey,

1665
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:43,250
I will let me finish.
Let me finish eating.

1666
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,620
Fucking wipe my hands.
I'm happy to take a picture with you.

1667
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,980
And he kept pressing me and then he
popped off afterwards.

1668
01:18:48,981 --> 01:18:50,030
After that.
I thought we settled it.

1669
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:52,020
Yeah,
I know what you mean,

1670
01:18:52,021 --> 01:18:55,170
man.
I'm from someone who's been interrupted

1671
01:18:55,171 --> 01:18:56,820
while you're eating.
It is annoying,

1672
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:00,000
but I've always tried to try to figure
out like,

1673
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:00,511
Whoa,
okay,

1674
01:19:00,511 --> 01:19:03,690
what is,
what's the difference between how weird

1675
01:19:03,691 --> 01:19:04,590
it is for me

1676
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:08,090
eating for off to me that is better at
that too.

1677
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:11,910
Over time where I put myself,
it's weird in a spot and I,

1678
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:16,840
and I'm nice and I remember and I
remember what it is to them for them to,

1679
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:17,870
to ask for that.

1680
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:18,621
Yeah.
Listen man,

1681
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:21,980
I got a man crush on Anthony Bourdain
that every time I hang around with them

1682
01:19:21,981 --> 01:19:22,814
I feel goofy.

1683
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:26,690
It's just a fact.
I just like,

1684
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,180
like I think I liked the way he thinks.
I like his balls.

1685
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:33,120
Guy Takes up Jujitsu when he's 58 years
old,

1686
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:34,940
you know?
And uh,

1687
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:40,400
like I think in certain situations you
have to understand that like the way you

1688
01:19:40,951 --> 01:19:45,420
feel around someone is affected by your
respect for them.

1689
01:19:45,421 --> 01:19:47,150
And sometimes it gets weird,
right?

1690
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,510
Like if a dude comes up to you,
it's like,

1691
01:19:48,511 --> 01:19:49,600
hey,
Hannibal Fan,

1692
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:52,260
I've got a picture and you're like,
I'm eating right now,

1693
01:19:52,261 --> 01:19:53,490
man,
relax.

1694
01:19:53,491 --> 01:19:56,010
And that they don't even know what the
fuck they're saying.

1695
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,160
You know,
like if,

1696
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:01,380
if I'm a Hannibal Fan and I walk up and
you got a mouthful wings and was just

1697
01:20:01,381 --> 01:20:02,940
this real quick,
we'll just take this picture.

1698
01:20:02,941 --> 01:20:06,060
I've got the fuck out of here.
I can't believe I took this chance.

1699
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,980
But I was like,
I told them,

1700
01:20:07,981 --> 01:20:08,790
yeah,
I mean,

1701
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:13,790
but I get that side of it and that's why
I wish I didn't react like that and I

1702
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:18,630
wish I,
I kept a chill and what I do more often

1703
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,421
now.
But.

1704
01:20:19,421 --> 01:20:20,260
So it's just,

1705
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:22,810
I don't know what you just said is
beautiful.

1706
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:26,570
I do more often now.
So you're thinking about it.

1707
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:27,920
I'm aware of it

1708
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,800
need me to come up to me and just,
uh,

1709
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:35,600
and I just remember what it is that,
that and that it is a,

1710
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,580
uh,
a privilege that they,

1711
01:20:37,581 --> 01:20:38,980
you know,
support my work and,

1712
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:42,860
and try to just give them that moment
versus.

1713
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:47,580
But even still,
some mother fuckers I genuinely root and

1714
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,600
sometimes people can be entitled and
sometimes people don't care if you're

1715
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:54,770
talking to three women,
right?

1716
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:00,420
They will,
they will bust that shit up.

1717
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:02,610
You're right.
I mean,

1718
01:21:02,611 --> 01:21:05,910
it's one of the things about life.
You never know who you're going to run

1719
01:21:05,911 --> 01:21:08,310
into.
You run into someone that's just goofy.

1720
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:10,070
Yeah.
But it's,

1721
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:12,360
it's,
uh,

1722
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,160
it's interesting.
It's just an interest in Lens,

1723
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:15,820
man.

1724
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:17,620
It's a,
it's an interesting Lens,

1725
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:22,680
not just for you,
but also for me to look through what

1726
01:21:23,231 --> 01:21:25,750
you're talking about.
But for other people too as well.

1727
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:26,801
You know,
I think,

1728
01:21:26,801 --> 01:21:27,310
uh,
we're,

1729
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:29,260
we're all doing this weird thing,
man.

1730
01:21:29,261 --> 01:21:33,430
We're all just surviving in this strange
life that's temporary.

1731
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:39,090
If we're lucky,
we get a hundred years if you're lucky.

1732
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,540
But the last super,
that's super dope for lucky,

1733
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,550
for the last few years he was just hang.
Yeah,

1734
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:52,090
just hanging on and just waiting to get
weary enough.

1735
01:21:52,091 --> 01:21:54,700
So you let go and slip into the abyss.

1736
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,260
Yeah.
I try to keep the perspective,

1737
01:21:57,290 --> 01:22:00,790
especially in this business willing,
this is a.

1738
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:04,190
maybe this is a limited moment.
This is a limited time.

1739
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:07,370
That's good.
It's not a hate when people like you say

1740
01:22:07,371 --> 01:22:08,950
that.
That's.

1741
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,400
I think I was talking about this last
time.

1742
01:22:10,401 --> 01:22:11,690
It's funny as fuck,
dude,

1743
01:22:11,691 --> 01:22:15,260
you're not going anywhere.
I hate when someone who's fucking pisses

1744
01:22:15,261 --> 01:22:16,160
me off.
Jim Norton,

1745
01:22:16,161 --> 01:22:18,890
if you listen to me,
you can stop telling me.

1746
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:21,230
Stop.
Stop telling me you're worried about

1747
01:22:21,231 --> 01:22:22,370
the.
Stop it.

1748
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:25,970
You're fucking awesome.
I hate when people don't know.

1749
01:22:25,971 --> 01:22:27,650
They're awesome.
You know,

1750
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,990
relaxed bitch.
But even Jim Norton,

1751
01:22:29,991 --> 01:22:32,240
you're fucking amazing.
Hilarious.

1752
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:35,120
You have to.
You don't have a goddamn thing to worry

1753
01:22:35,121 --> 01:22:37,460
about.
It's going to be people going to see Jim

1754
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,710
Norton for the end of time and I'm one
of them.

1755
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:43,910
I feel the same way about you.
I mean,

1756
01:22:43,911 --> 01:22:47,600
I just,
I think a seven years,

1757
01:22:47,601 --> 01:22:49,880
seven more years,
hotels got hotels on the

1758
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:54,650
stocks,
you know,

1759
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:59,710
you do stocks up a little bit.
I do a really intelligent Jewish

1760
01:23:01,461 --> 01:23:06,220
gentlemen who handle your money,
so because you're too fucking do it.

1761
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:07,330
That's what I do.
I,

1762
01:23:07,331 --> 01:23:11,610
uh,
I a big fan of the Jews.

1763
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:14,380
They had put some,
those people,

1764
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:17,830
the money people,
they have put a lot of my money in

1765
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:21,070
mutual funds.
Then I looked at what a mutual fund is

1766
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:23,310
with other people buying stocks,
but I don't,

1767
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:25,570
I don't like that.
And a cash album,

1768
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,480
mutual funds and I want to pick my own
stocks.

1769
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,800
Well,
if you're really into owning hotels of

1770
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:34,180
picking stocks,
I understand me.

1771
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,630
I'm not into that,
you know,

1772
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:41,640
a company I like.
Is this company called Catapult Sports?

1773
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:50,440
They do,
they do wearable gps technology who I'm

1774
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:54,590
the Golden State Warriors is using some
other proteins using like,

1775
01:23:54,591 --> 01:23:58,520
what are you wearing?
Like a steak for practice in different

1776
01:23:58,521 --> 01:24:01,820
training.
They tracked athletes' performance.

1777
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:05,570
Wow.
How crazy is that?

1778
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:08,870
The tracking people from a satellite,
how fast they're moving.

1779
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:10,020
Just different.
I mean,

1780
01:24:10,030 --> 01:24:12,410
I can't get into the super specifics of
it.

1781
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,330
A Mark Cuban invested in,
um,

1782
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,720
2014.
I,

1783
01:24:17,721 --> 01:24:21,110
uh,
I found them on accident when I was

1784
01:24:21,111 --> 01:24:22,970
looking up.
I was looking up some pharmaceutical

1785
01:24:22,971 --> 01:24:26,720
company called catalyst and not for some
reason my brain put catapult.

1786
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:29,180
Then I found this company started
looking it up.

1787
01:24:29,181 --> 01:24:31,610
I found them by accident.
I found them on accident,

1788
01:24:31,611 --> 01:24:36,260
started looking it up and I uh,
I invested in of heavily.

1789
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:40,340
That's a very good move to do you want
to be my manager.

1790
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:47,720
So that is a really huge.
You got super real,

1791
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:51,320
super fortunate.
That's like a crazy.

1792
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:53,000
But uh,
yeah,

1793
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:53,450
it,
it,

1794
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:56,630
it,
it was recent as about two months ago at

1795
01:24:56,650 --> 01:25:00,700
anytime I call my stock guy,
I keep up in my position in him and I'll

1796
01:25:00,701 --> 01:25:02,720
call him as a,
put a little,

1797
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,200
give me $25,000 more on,
on catapult.

1798
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,180
And then he like handled Melissa give me
a call real quick.

1799
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:13,650
Can't just text him now he just wants to
talk me through you show.

1800
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:17,810
Oh,
you show you.

1801
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,770
What about that other stock I told you
about?

1802
01:25:21,771 --> 01:25:24,150
You show you that stock is doing way
better now.

1803
01:25:24,151 --> 01:25:24,700
All right.
Hey,

1804
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,570
let's just do.
I like catapult,

1805
01:25:26,571 --> 01:25:27,450
man.
Dude,

1806
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:31,640
you just blew catapult the fuck up.
I liked when you just did.

1807
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:35,200
I think it's a solid.
I mean,

1808
01:25:35,201 --> 01:25:36,430
but I,
I wouldn't,

1809
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,850
I've told friends about it.
They like it too.

1810
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:43,610
I just,
it's still early in the company and they

1811
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:46,430
got offices in the states.
They based in Australia,

1812
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:47,170
I think,
uh,

1813
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:49,360
if I don't know what the fuck it is,
explaining it to me.

1814
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:53,860
What does it mean?
Wearable GPS technology.

1815
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:56,470
Now if I'm an idiot and I'm hearing
that.

1816
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,190
Um,
okay.

1817
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:02,190
So you use a satellite to track the
movement of the performance,

1818
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:03,940
like heart rate,

1819
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:06,310
a workload?
Yeah.

1820
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:09,620
Sap,
it's all done through like what an ankle

1821
01:26:09,621 --> 01:26:10,640
bracelet.
Like what do you,

1822
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:13,370
what do you put on them?
I think that chest.

1823
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,870
How do you,
how do you know what the exertion is?

1824
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:21,390
Is it a vest outside vest?
Is it okay?

1825
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:22,400
It's a little picture of what that
means.

1826
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:24,260
Oh,
this guy.

1827
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:26,930
Oh,
that's what you were showing me earlier.

1828
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:28,280
Oh,
that's different.

1829
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:29,450
Okay.
That makes sense.

1830
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:34,660
This dude just got like a chest harness,
which I'm sure could measure.

1831
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:37,190
I don't know,
like energy.

1832
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:42,410
What would it measure?
How does something on your chest measure

1833
01:26:42,411 --> 01:26:44,180
what you're doing with your legs?
Like,

1834
01:26:44,181 --> 01:26:44,961
how do those,
uh,

1835
01:26:44,961 --> 01:26:49,961
iphone apps measure your strides and how
many steps you take and you can do it

1836
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:51,130
off of like a,
there's a,

1837
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:54,020
it's not easy math,
but they can tell how far off,

1838
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:56,570
like if you're six foot and know how
long like the,

1839
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:59,390
Oh,
you enter your height and the whatever

1840
01:26:59,391 --> 01:26:59,780
it's called.

1841
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:01,700
The little interesting cycle.
Amateur,

1842
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:03,720
I think of the right word.
But.

1843
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:07,490
So it's not necessarily tracking you
through GPS.

1844
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,800
This one might be,
I don't know.

1845
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:12,380
This one is right?
Isn't that the premise on this one?

1846
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:13,700
I mean,
how do you know how they do it in the

1847
01:27:13,701 --> 01:27:16,070
UFC where they're tracking how much,
how many feet they're running around the

1848
01:27:16,071 --> 01:27:17,420
October?
That's a good question.

1849
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:21,200
They don't have a gps shit.
They probably following them with like a

1850
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:22,790
tracer,
maybe a dude.

1851
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:26,090
Uh,
it's his job to follow each person with

1852
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:27,050
A.
I mean,

1853
01:27:27,051 --> 01:27:28,400
I would do that,
but you know what man,

1854
01:27:28,401 --> 01:27:30,620
that,
that statistic is interesting.

1855
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:31,693
And I,
I,

1856
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:34,980
I support the chasing of the data and
try to figure out how much someone will

1857
01:27:34,981 --> 01:27:36,740
be lose.
But it's not that important.

1858
01:27:37,570 --> 01:27:38,960
It's not that important.
Yeah,

1859
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,370
it's weird.
It's getting super specific because it

1860
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:44,900
doesn't necessarily,
uh,

1861
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:47,030
it's,
it's a statistic.

1862
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,890
It's interesting.
Just didn't dwell on it.

1863
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:52,260
So these dudes that are playing soccer,
they met the,

1864
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:56,600
the monitor all that too,
like how much each team runs and all

1865
01:27:56,601 --> 01:27:58,010
that shit.
They just in football,

1866
01:27:58,011 --> 01:28:00,140
they just recently,
the last couple of years stop hitting

1867
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:02,540
and practice.
Not more because I found out about

1868
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:05,250
concussions and whatnot,
but it's also added technology and like

1869
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,430
when I was at cowboys training camp last
week,

1870
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:11,330
there was a guy telling me they brought
an eight k cameras for when Tony Romo

1871
01:28:11,331 --> 01:28:14,870
was hurt so he could sit in a truck in
the back of practice and watch real time

1872
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,900
football practice with a headset on,
like vr stuff.

1873
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:18,920
Oh Wow.
Shit.

1874
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:24,020
And so he could see the real
don't give advice on what was going on.

1875
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:27,980
He was heard for the last eight weeks or
whatever the year and that,

1876
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,590
they don't have it all the time because
it's really expensive to run right now

1877
01:28:30,591 --> 01:28:30,950
still.

1878
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:34,420
But they still had three d,
three 60 cameras running around

1879
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:38,270
following the players.
A crazy stuff.

1880
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,990
Just shout out to uh,
the dude from the Dallas cowboys.

1881
01:28:40,991 --> 01:28:41,824
He was,
what's his name,

1882
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:44,740
Charles that drives the Charles?
He hooked it up.

1883
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:46,910
He gave me a car to give Jamie.
It's like,

1884
01:28:46,911 --> 01:28:49,280
I know Jamie's a football fan.
Let's make it happen.

1885
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:53,890
Grid iron.
They're doing that for the UFC to just

1886
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:55,850
trying different things out.
Three 60 video.

1887
01:28:55,851 --> 01:28:59,090
There's new technology will be.
There's going to be virtual reality

1888
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:03,810
where you're going to be able to like be
Nick Diaz as he fights against conor

1889
01:29:03,811 --> 01:29:04,730
mcgregor.
You're gonna.

1890
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:06,960
Be able to look through each fighters
eyes.

1891
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:08,790
They're going to figure out a way to do
it.

1892
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:12,980
Imagine just a little chip is needed.
What,

1893
01:29:12,981 --> 01:29:15,000
what shape you got Jamie?
The s 18.

1894
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:17,160
Oh Man.
He should have waited for the 19.

1895
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:17,830
I know,
I know,

1896
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:20,310
but I'm pretty happy with the 18.
I mean it's,

1897
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:24,660
it doesn't take as much battery life.
I got 363 d capability.

1898
01:29:24,661 --> 01:29:26,820
It's just low resolution.
It's good.

1899
01:29:26,821 --> 01:29:28,440
Yep.
We're good at video.

1900
01:29:28,441 --> 01:29:33,441
Game was pretty intense to the new UFC
game on ps and I know it sounds like I'm

1901
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:34,681
plugging,
but it.

1902
01:29:34,681 --> 01:29:35,514
No,
it was cool.

1903
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,260
We would yelling me and my me and my
friend was like,

1904
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:40,860
God,
like it was that intense because it was,

1905
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,420
you know,
there's parts where you almost want to

1906
01:29:42,421 --> 01:29:44,850
knock the guy out and then it's a good
game.

1907
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,010
Very good game.
Have Fun.

1908
01:29:47,011 --> 01:29:49,480
So I,
I can attest to it because uh,

1909
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:51,930
I had to do the commentary for that
game.

1910
01:29:51,931 --> 01:29:52,764
Yeah.
Like the,

1911
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:56,100
when you hear that EA sports game,
that's not commentary from actual fights

1912
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:59,220
as commentary.
Just me doing pretend and Goldberg don't

1913
01:29:59,221 --> 01:30:04,030
pretend and do,
we did a fuck load of ours.

1914
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:07,590
Yeah.
I mean it was hours and hours and hours

1915
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:10,050
and hours and it was over a long and I'm
not complaining,

1916
01:30:10,051 --> 01:30:13,200
I'm just saying you had to say so much
stuff.

1917
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:15,360
And there's a man that scan meaning

1918
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:19,390
well on a game.
Yeah.

1919
01:30:19,391 --> 01:30:20,430
I'm in the game.
You have to,

1920
01:30:20,431 --> 01:30:22,020
um,
have a secret.

1921
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:24,960
I got to have a code,
like the Konami Code.

1922
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:28,080
Oh,
I did this so I can get out of doing

1923
01:30:28,081 --> 01:30:32,400
more commentary because there was so
much to do.

1924
01:30:32,401 --> 01:30:35,130
Tamra wish I looked that good.
There was so much to do.

1925
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:36,570
Uh,
as though it was,

1926
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:41,860
it was a constant grind.
But I put my app,

1927
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:44,040
my full effort into it.
Like I,

1928
01:30:44,041 --> 01:30:45,480
I really wanted it to be good.
Oh,

1929
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:48,420
I was thinking if I was a kid and I was
playing this game,

1930
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,150
I would want it to sound like,
like a guy really got head.

1931
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:55,350
It's isn't as like we are.
Here it is,

1932
01:30:55,351 --> 01:30:56,070
man.
It,

1933
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:58,890
it was a fun.
Is like I want to see me get beat the

1934
01:30:58,891 --> 01:31:00,570
fuck up.
Just Jamie.

1935
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:06,030
Jamie shown a video of me about to get
my ass kicked by Nick Diaz are you get

1936
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:08,640
destroyed really fast.
I would imagine if the game is

1937
01:31:08,641 --> 01:31:10,110
realistic,
pull it up.

1938
01:31:10,370 --> 01:31:11,710
I'll come and I get fucked up.

1939
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:15,970
But they might have used to show secret
character.

1940
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:18,400
They might have.
You got some bullshit skills.

1941
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:21,190
Have you juiced up?
It doesn't matter.

1942
01:31:21,191 --> 01:31:23,500
I got some bullshit with bills.
Let's hear my.

1943
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:25,280
Because you know,
I'm super casual fan,

1944
01:31:25,281 --> 01:31:26,680
so my commentary.
No.

1945
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:29,080
Rather with the leg kick.
I've never heard this before.

1946
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:31,480
Oh,
we're all good with the leg kicks.

1947
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:35,300
Get kicked in the face.
I'll get with the cakes.

1948
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:37,790
Diaz is backing it up.
Rogan missed.

1949
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:39,760
Oh really?
It kicked in the chest.

1950
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,590
Tattoos?
Accurate.

1951
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:44,860
Look at that.
Holy Shit.

1952
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:47,120
Oh.

1953
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:50,330
Oh.

1954
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,780
Oh.
Broke his neck.

1955
01:31:54,781 --> 01:31:57,130
Can about the high disadvantage.
Ow.

1956
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:58,580
Oh ow.
Ow.

1957
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:03,550
World is in danger.
Let's see what rogue his ground game is

1958
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:05,030
like.
Not Good.

1959
01:32:05,670 --> 01:32:10,270
Diaz is about the price.
Road Dog Shit off my back.

1960
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:12,220
Will Rogen.
Be able to pull off a submission from

1961
01:32:12,221 --> 01:32:13,080
this position.
Oh,

1962
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:14,680
is it?
Oh,

1963
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:19,080
turnaround.
It's called sweep this amount.

1964
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:21,540
I let him up.
Wow.

1965
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:25,070
Good.
Back Up.

1966
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:29,680
Oh,
this should be illegal.

1967
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,860
Oh,
roles should be illegal.

1968
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,860
Back in two people fake fight.
When you know one dude would beat the

1969
01:32:35,861 --> 01:32:39,140
fuck out of me.
No Nice had made.

1970
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:41,890
So it's not.
Leave any.

1971
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,740
Any confusion.
Oh,

1972
01:32:44,741 --> 01:32:46,790
this is so stupid.
We'll

1973
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:51,450
he's
out.

1974
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:55,620
Wait,
let me punch him in the head when he was

1975
01:32:55,621 --> 01:32:55,770
young.

1976
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:57,570
Conscious.
Why don't they stop the fight?

1977
01:32:57,571 --> 01:33:02,430
Quicken a fake me rather than the fake
him out.

1978
01:33:02,431 --> 01:33:03,930
That feels weird,
but felt weird.

1979
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:08,310
You know what bothered me the most,
the last two punches because he wasn't.

1980
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:11,130
He was already unconscious.
The fake him.

1981
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:13,980
Oh,
did you know hard?

1982
01:33:13,981 --> 01:33:18,981
Nick Diaz would fuck me up like this is
an embarrassment to humanity is allowed

1983
01:33:19,441 --> 01:33:24,441
to be a visual image of me.
Beat Nick Diaz is dumped all the Brian

1984
01:33:24,481 --> 01:33:25,610
James.
Dude.

1985
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:26,890
Enjoy Shit,
man.

1986
01:33:28,290 --> 01:33:29,460
That's what.
That's what?

1987
01:33:29,490 --> 01:33:30,690
That's what?
It's an escape.

1988
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:33,870
This is what I want to say.
I want to see Nick Diaz versus conor

1989
01:33:33,871 --> 01:33:35,310
Mcgregor.
That's what I want to say.

1990
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:37,440
I want to see that more than I want to
see anything in life.

1991
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:38,161
I was.
I had,

1992
01:33:38,161 --> 01:33:42,720
so I want to say I want to see the
Aurora borealis more that I want to go

1993
01:33:42,721 --> 01:33:46,860
to the Keck observatory in Hawaii and
revisit the Milky Way more than I want

1994
01:33:46,861 --> 01:33:51,120
to see any of those things.
I want to see Nick Diaz versus.

1995
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,540
No.
Nick Diaz.

1996
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:58,170
Conor mcgregor had a cool his little
walk around or wearing as he got it.

1997
01:33:58,230 --> 01:33:59,700
It was awesome.
He was awesome.

1998
01:33:59,701 --> 01:34:01,860
He's a bad motherfucker.
Did would,

1999
01:34:01,861 --> 01:34:04,560
the way he walked around it would have
gotten the ring.

2000
01:34:04,561 --> 01:34:07,020
I didn't think he was going to get
punched in the face as much as he did

2001
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,210
and we still won.
But that was a cocky inches.

2002
01:34:09,211 --> 01:34:09,571
I was like,
oh,

2003
01:34:09,571 --> 01:34:11,730
he bought the first round,
knock out this mother fucker.

2004
01:34:11,731 --> 01:34:13,530
The way he just came in here.
Well,

2005
01:34:13,531 --> 01:34:15,210
I mean,
what he's trying to do is just like

2006
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,430
shake it off,
put an air out there.

2007
01:34:17,431 --> 01:34:19,560
But at the end of the day he's fighting
Nate Diaz.

2008
01:34:19,561 --> 01:34:21,270
He's no one's getting a first round
knockout,

2009
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,370
crazy war.
He knew it.

2010
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:28,200
He had to be conservative in that fight.
Energy was so crazy.

2011
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,760
It was insane.
It was.

2012
01:34:29,761 --> 01:34:30,594
So.
It was.

2013
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:32,940
I was so nothing ever right.
It was.

2014
01:34:32,941 --> 01:34:34,770
So.
I'm so glad I went to see a lot.

2015
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:36,390
Oh Man.
So He.

2016
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,350
Me Too.
So,

2017
01:34:37,351 --> 01:34:37,800
um,
uh,

2018
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:38,750
as I,
as I said,

2019
01:34:38,751 --> 01:34:43,200
I'm a casual fan.
So there's a couple of times where a

2020
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:48,620
kinda knocked him to the ground,
Kinda doesn't want to do ground game

2021
01:34:49,051 --> 01:34:50,770
with him because he was,
he was,

2022
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:52,680
he was,
he was,

2023
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,060
he would tell them to come up.
Right.

2024
01:34:54,110 --> 01:34:57,500
I would think normally for my lack,
not much

2025
01:34:58,130 --> 01:34:59,900
knowledge.
I would think once you knock somebody to

2026
01:34:59,901 --> 01:35:03,410
the ground,
you try to go in with those hammerfest

2027
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,640
you could,
you could.

2028
01:35:04,690 --> 01:35:07,390
However,
if you do that with a guy like nate

2029
01:35:07,391 --> 01:35:09,160
Diaz,
he might not be hurt at all,

2030
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:11,320
especially when you consider the fact
that,

2031
01:35:11,321 --> 01:35:14,240
uh,
he connor through a bunch of really

2032
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:18,690
powerful left leg kicks and he had
fucked up nate's right leg because,

2033
01:35:18,691 --> 01:35:23,470
because of the fact that both southpaw,
what happens is that back leg becomes

2034
01:35:23,471 --> 01:35:25,210
the front leg.
So the right leg is in front,

2035
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:26,920
right?
And he's just getting chewed up.

2036
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:29,230
But this left power lead character right
from the beginning,

2037
01:35:29,231 --> 01:35:31,690
like over and over and over and over
again.

2038
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:35,980
When you get hit with a bunch of,
like really powerful leg kicks like

2039
01:35:35,981 --> 01:35:37,990
that,
it makes it super difficult for you to

2040
01:35:37,991 --> 01:35:38,840
move.
Right.

2041
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:41,790
You know?
And then conor just fought a smooth,

2042
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,140
smart game plan,
you know,

2043
01:35:44,141 --> 01:35:47,380
he um,
he engaged from the outside where he,

2044
01:35:47,381 --> 01:35:52,381
his speed was an advantage and did some
damage but didn't unload himself like he

2045
01:35:53,651 --> 01:35:55,270
did in the first fight,
in the first fight.

2046
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:58,510
He did that too.
But if any unloaded himself a nate

2047
01:35:58,511 --> 01:36:01,270
survived and when he survived,
Connor's gas tank was empty.

2048
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,550
So this time connor was way more
conservative.

2049
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:05,470
Yeah.
We'll see you running away a little.

2050
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:07,670
But he'll run and get,
you know,

2051
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:08,570
you could,
you could say it.

2052
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:10,330
He got away from him.
He ran away.

2053
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:14,070
But when he was on a cake,
want to get close to the kt over it and

2054
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,060
make it more into the sense of it,
man.

2055
01:36:16,061 --> 01:36:17,000
It's okay.
You don't.

2056
01:36:17,001 --> 01:36:19,350
People are mad that he ran away.
Who wound your mood?

2057
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:23,770
Because sometimes you take a break.
Sometimes you take a break.

2058
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,340
He knows the three moments in the round.
He's got he,

2059
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,790
he knows there's,
I mean,

2060
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:29,320
I don't know when it was,
there was,

2061
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:32,380
there was a couple moments in time where
he totally turned away from him.

2062
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:34,660
But then he engaged.

2063
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:35,631
Yeah,
he did.

2064
01:36:35,631 --> 01:36:37,610
It wasn't like he was running the whole.
He was just,

2065
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:41,090
when he found himself in a compromising
position,

2066
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:43,900
he would get out of it.
It's interesting.

2067
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:46,960
It's an interesting thing to do.
You guys try to kick your ass.

2068
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:51,430
I'm going to go over here for a minute.
It's something funny about it.

2069
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,230
You know?
Seemed like a good mood.

2070
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:55,300
It's the right move.
When you're.

2071
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:57,280
When you don't feel like you can fight
right now.

2072
01:36:57,490 --> 01:37:02,490
What do you want to do?
Stand in their to get on the boys got

2073
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:05,100
mom,
get in there.

2074
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:09,730
If you don't feel like you can breathe,
maybe you should move away and breathe.

2075
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:13,030
Otherwise some dude could punch you in
the body and you can go down.

2076
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,970
It's like it's not a smart move to stand
in there.

2077
01:37:15,971 --> 01:37:16,990
If you feel tired,

2078
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:22,920
how many fights do you think happened
amongst the audience members?

2079
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:25,330
Because that's way less than you would
think.

2080
01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:29,130
I saw this girl,
she was fighting her boyfriend or

2081
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:31,780
something.
I don't even know if it's a boyfriend,

2082
01:37:31,781 --> 01:37:33,940
but she was choking him and she was
going crazy.

2083
01:37:33,941 --> 01:37:37,750
He and she had walked away and she came
back to him and then,

2084
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:41,710
uh,
she was blind and sorta look lightly

2085
01:37:41,711 --> 01:37:43,810
like Ronda Rousey.
I posted it on snapchat.

2086
01:37:43,811 --> 01:37:47,980
You Ronda Rousey out here tripping
and then,

2087
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:51,100
uh,
and then,

2088
01:37:51,101 --> 01:37:53,920
uh,
and then some immigrate twitter posts.

2089
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:58,950
Apparently Ronda Rousey Ronda rousey
wouldn't be running

2090
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:03,010
crazy and it was a video of you don't
really see the face,

2091
01:38:03,011 --> 01:38:06,990
but you see security chasing some blonde
woman that is so stupid.

2092
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,700
He apparently Hannibal spot at Ronda
Rousey.

2093
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,010
Apparently he's the only one that's
nobody else to.

2094
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:16,120
That's hilarious.
That was so stupid.

2095
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:20,980
It was good time.
She's like one of the women that you

2096
01:38:20,981 --> 01:38:23,080
would ever want to fight like at a gas
station.

2097
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:25,870
You know,
like Rhonda Rousey.

2098
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:28,990
She throw you in your fucking head on
the concrete.

2099
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:31,500
That's terrible.
It's terrifying.

2100
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:34,390
Have women like that out there.
I could just beat your ass.

2101
01:38:34,391 --> 01:38:34,870
Huh?

2102
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:36,130
It's terrifying.
Like it.

2103
01:38:37,130 --> 01:38:41,630
Whenever I'm at the UFC and somebody
gets kicked in the face,

2104
01:38:42,610 --> 01:38:45,660
I just always,
I just think about how disappointed I'd

2105
01:38:45,661 --> 01:38:49,010
be if I got kicked in the face of what
did I do in my life?

2106
01:38:49,011 --> 01:38:51,710
Was somebody kicking me in the face.
Even especially.

2107
01:38:51,711 --> 01:38:54,200
I mean you've never been kicked in the
face.

2108
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:59,450
It's just been kicked in the face.
Especially like that's why I'm glad I

2109
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:02,120
didn't fight that guy and I'm glad I
don't.

2110
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:05,210
I don't put myself in situations where I
got to fight a strategy because you

2111
01:39:05,211 --> 01:39:07,410
never know where.
I'm just.

2112
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:09,350
If,
if I was to be fighting,

2113
01:39:09,351 --> 01:39:14,351
I'm trying to throw hands poorly,
but if somebody just kicked me in the

2114
01:39:14,421 --> 01:39:15,860
face and be like,
oh,

2115
01:39:15,861 --> 01:39:17,780
I didn't,
I didn't know you would go do that.

2116
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:20,590
Is Donald cerrone combination.
God Damn.

2117
01:39:20,591 --> 01:39:22,010
That's beautiful.
Right?

2118
01:39:22,030 --> 01:39:23,920
Left high kick.
Boom.

2119
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:25,450
Yeah,
and they just turned his back.

2120
01:39:25,690 --> 01:39:27,330
That is Matrix Shit.
DOTS.

2121
01:39:27,331 --> 01:39:31,240
Ronnie lives in the fucking Matrix.
Do Right now at almost 70.

2122
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:33,370
He's coming on the podcast next week.
Jamie,

2123
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:36,040
he's here on next Tuesday.
I'm going to fucking convince him.

2124
01:39:36,041 --> 01:39:40,560
Live on the Internet.
Don't drop down from one 70 and one

2125
01:39:40,570 --> 01:39:44,050
slash 70 is a fucking wizard.
Who the hell stop and rick story like

2126
01:39:44,051 --> 01:39:45,210
this.
Um,

2127
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:49,810
and Donald cerrone is a fucking wizard.
He's a wizard at one 70

2128
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:55,560
if it felt it felt kind of barbaric or
archaic,

2129
01:39:55,661 --> 01:40:00,661
but when you have money on my and then
beating the shit out of somebody else

2130
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:07,140
and you're winning,
it's a different type of emotion.

2131
01:40:07,630 --> 01:40:10,810
When he went serone started fucking that
dude up.

2132
01:40:10,811 --> 01:40:11,644
I stood up.

2133
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:15,710
You were in there with them.
I was in there.

2134
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:18,780
Isn't there with fucking couple thousand
dollars?

2135
01:40:18,781 --> 01:40:19,800
Hell yeah,
I was with them.

2136
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:24,240
I was in fucking appreciate your
loyalty.

2137
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:26,280
First of all,
it's both on it.

2138
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:28,590
And Donald Cerrone,
dope.

2139
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,780
And then a Johnson.
Uh,

2140
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:34,920
I bet on Johnson right before the fight
started,

2141
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:36,960
I was like,
what were the aunt?

2142
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:41,310
He was minus 2:50.
So that's pretty reasonable considering

2143
01:40:41,311 --> 01:40:44,800
how hard he hit and he wanted so fast.
So I got on it.

2144
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,670
We think it's.
Somebody told me I have to research it.

2145
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:50,850
Please do.
Was that the fastest knockout in the

2146
01:40:50,851 --> 01:40:52,890
history of the light heavyweight
division?

2147
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:53,803
I think it was close,

2148
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,850
it was 13 seconds or something.
We'll all go to place.

2149
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,440
My Bet.
He hit so hard.

2150
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:02,680
That happened so fast.
It was like he hit so hard.

2151
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:06,340
It happens so quick.
When glover started pressuring him,

2152
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:09,240
like what?
When I score a fight or rather a

2153
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,470
commentator fight when I watched
something like that.

2154
01:41:11,471 --> 01:41:12,310
And I'm like,
okay,

2155
01:41:12,311 --> 01:41:15,190
what can glow overdue and what can
rumble too.

2156
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:17,530
We know rumble has awesome stand up
skills.

2157
01:41:17,531 --> 01:41:19,510
We know we had a college wrestling
background.

2158
01:41:19,511 --> 01:41:22,870
We know he's a really powerful and he's
probably the hardest hitter ever.

2159
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:26,020
So what can we do?
He's really technical.

2160
01:41:26,110 --> 01:41:30,070
He can survive a storm.
Maybe he could take him down,

2161
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:33,520
maybe get them into deep water.
So we start town super aggressive.

2162
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:38,521
Bob and we even Tyson style and the one
haymaker one haymaker upper cut.

2163
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:42,430
So third,
Ryan,

2164
01:41:42,431 --> 01:41:43,660
Jim.
Oh Wow.

2165
01:41:43,661 --> 01:41:45,990
Seven seconds.
Goddamn Ryan Chimo.

2166
01:41:46,490 --> 01:41:47,410
Uh,
rest in peace.

2167
01:41:47,411 --> 01:41:47,861
Ryan.
Jim.

2168
01:41:47,861 --> 01:41:49,110
Oh,
he just died recently.

2169
01:41:49,111 --> 01:41:51,610
I got run over by a car and Canada.
Shit.

2170
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:56,560
James Irvin Sandman eight seconds.
Who did he fight?

2171
01:41:57,790 --> 01:42:02,790
And then John's John's.
Is that gambling to gamble on that?

2172
01:42:04,530 --> 01:42:07,930
And have it happened in that fast that's
like fucking craps.

2173
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:13,390
They should put like a 32nd over under
on summer rumbles fights.

2174
01:42:13,770 --> 01:42:18,310
This is literally a 32nd because he's so
scary right now.

2175
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,240
He's so scary.
He hits guys in a totally different way.

2176
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:26,230
It's like he knows something that nobody
knows about.

2177
01:42:26,231 --> 01:42:27,850
How to hit people.
This dude.

2178
01:42:27,851 --> 01:42:31,450
What was that guy's record?
Daddy fought for Alexander.

2179
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:32,950
Eight seconds.
That's right.

2180
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:34,240
What was the guy?
Johnson.

2181
01:42:34,241 --> 01:42:36,000
False record.
Was it 25?

2182
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:39,100
He was an elite fighter.
Oh,

2183
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:43,030
glover is beyond elite glover's font for
the title.

2184
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:46,450
He had a five round fight with Jon
Jones.

2185
01:42:46,451 --> 01:42:47,870
Went to the distance.
Yeah.

2186
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:51,220
So one of the best fighters in the
world.

2187
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:52,450
Glover's.
Excellent.

2188
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:56,320
And that's crazy that he got gotten 13
seconds.

2189
01:42:56,350 --> 01:42:57,430
You don't what it is,
man.

2190
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:00,770
There's the human frame.
You know,

2191
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,130
like the skull,
the brain,

2192
01:43:03,131 --> 01:43:08,131
the neck can only take so much.
It just can only take so much.

2193
01:43:08,510 --> 01:43:11,530
Yeah.
And most people can't hit that bell.

2194
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:15,250
You know that bell when you go to the
carnival and he slammed down on that

2195
01:43:15,251 --> 01:43:17,440
bell and the little thing goes up.
And

2196
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:22,780
most people can't make that thing Dang
in this world.

2197
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:27,760
But Rumble Johnson,
he can make that thing ding every time

2198
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:31,570
with his open barrage you with is a
first,

2199
01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:34,660
you know,
name the number 200 punches and kicks,

2200
01:43:34,661 --> 01:43:36,970
whatever it is.
He can knock you the fuck out.

2201
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:42,300
The question with a guy like that is,
if it gets past that 200 number and the

2202
01:43:42,401 --> 01:43:45,200
opponent is still there,
can you make it through it?

2203
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:47,140
And that's what happened in the cormier
fight.

2204
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:50,920
It's like rumble hit with everything but
the kitchen sink.

2205
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:56,440
But cormier is so fucking tough.
He's so tough from being a world class

2206
01:43:58,011 --> 01:44:01,040
Olympic wrestler from a guy who competed
all over the world.

2207
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:05,210
He's just got this.
This is like a level of toughness that

2208
01:44:05,211 --> 01:44:08,780
you can't recreate.
And he takes a big bomb but figures out

2209
01:44:08,781 --> 01:44:13,300
how to scramble and survive.
And so he makes it into law.

2210
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:15,590
What rounded cormay?
Submit rumble.

2211
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:20,910
See,
the thing about a guy like rumble though

2212
01:44:20,911 --> 01:44:25,710
is you could submit them once,
but once he figures out what you did and

2213
01:44:25,711 --> 01:44:29,130
he remembers how much it sucked when you
did that to him.

2214
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:32,550
Can you do it again and if you can't do
it again,

2215
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,820
what if he can figure out how to keep it
standing?

2216
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:38,310
Yeah.
What if he could figure out how to keep

2217
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:43,370
hitting you with those barrages of heavy
bones coming flying at you with perfect

2218
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:48,360
technique.
He is so fucking hard,

2219
01:44:48,361 --> 01:44:51,390
man.
What third round?

2220
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:54,540
Well,
cormay took them into deep water,

2221
01:44:54,541 --> 01:44:57,720
man.
What is comedy is such a bad

2222
01:44:57,721 --> 01:44:58,554
motherfucker

2223
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,740
at?
Where does that come from?

2224
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:05,400
We know that some people just naturally
fast.

2225
01:45:05,401 --> 01:45:09,690
Is that,
is that just a uses naturally able to

2226
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:13,640
hit hardest fuck.
Or do you punch walls?

2227
01:45:13,650 --> 01:45:16,860
Sometimes you can close it up.
You can get better,

2228
01:45:16,861 --> 01:45:20,050
but it is also a natural sort of this

2229
01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:24,390
the reality of it.
A totally objectively,

2230
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:28,260
everybody has a ceiling and you can't
pass that ceiling.

2231
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:33,030
You see certain people that have certain
frames like maybe they have really

2232
01:45:33,031 --> 01:45:37,200
narrow shoulders and really small hands
and it really small waist.

2233
01:45:37,650 --> 01:45:41,820
They can't generate the same kind of
power that a guy like rumble Johnson,

2234
01:45:41,821 --> 01:45:44,550
Ken,
or there's a lot of other guys like guy

2235
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:45,990
like rampage Jackson,
Ken,

2236
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:48,370
for a guy like George St Pierre can.
There's.

2237
01:45:48,371 --> 01:45:50,940
There's certain like physiques,
Ilir,

2238
01:45:50,941 --> 01:45:52,830
Latifa.
You ever see that guy fight?

2239
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,840
No.
Pull this motherfucker up.

2240
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:58,620
I think he's fighting Ryan Bader.
I say motherfucker with all due respect

2241
01:45:58,621 --> 01:46:02,970
sir.
He's just tank of a wrestler and you

2242
01:46:02,971 --> 01:46:05,550
look at that guys frame and he just
bombs on dudes.

2243
01:46:05,551 --> 01:46:07,980
Knocks him unconscious,
but you look at his frame and he's

2244
01:46:07,981 --> 01:46:08,820
throwing punches.

2245
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:09,991
Let's go.
Okay.

2246
01:46:09,991 --> 01:46:13,200
That's like this is.
There's levels of athletes,

2247
01:46:13,230 --> 01:46:15,150
right?
There's levels of wrestlers.

2248
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:18,840
His levels of strikers and when you see
certain dudes,

2249
01:46:18,841 --> 01:46:22,140
the way they can move their body,
like you ever watched Cirque du Solei?

2250
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:23,880
Yeah.
Even seeing it live,

2251
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,510
seeing it left 70 degrees.
It is amazing.

2252
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:29,460
You feel like how the fuck do they do
that with their body?

2253
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:32,640
You immediately start feeling inadequate
with your body.

2254
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:37,990
I mean that's why I feel I just can't.
I just get inspired by the choreography

2255
01:46:38,251 --> 01:46:39,900
and I said I need to step my show up.
Oh,

2256
01:46:39,901 --> 01:46:42,020
that's a beautiful one.
I'm going to target.

2257
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:46,020
I think I want to figure out how to do a
handstand with one hand check above

2258
01:46:46,021 --> 01:46:48,440
being with one hand.
So this is hank.

2259
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:49,883
Yeah.

2260
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:52,730
So he's the light heavyweight and
heavyweight light heavyweight two.

2261
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:53,420
Oh,
five.

2262
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:55,360
Okay.
So the point being that a gentleman,

2263
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:58,150
13 pounds less than me,
he's,

2264
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:01,090
I'm a light heavyweight.
Well me and him one on one.

2265
01:47:01,210 --> 01:47:03,700
He weighs 200,
five for about 13 minutes,

2266
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:08,830
probably goes back up to whatever it is
before he starts this cut.

2267
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:11,200
But my point being like,
just like look at the size of that

2268
01:47:11,201 --> 01:47:13,360
motherfucker.
I mean Jesus Christ,

2269
01:47:13,361 --> 01:47:15,400
look at that dude.
He's a tank.

2270
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:18,610
There's,
there's limitations of the human frame

2271
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:22,870
and that guy has a different bone
structure than Doogie howser.

2272
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:25,150
You know,
there's just no denying it.

2273
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,610
It's or no,
that's a bad example.

2274
01:47:27,611 --> 01:47:31,270
But you know,
there's a lot of guys that are his size.

2275
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:34,000
They just don't have the kind of
advantages that he has.

2276
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:37,630
Bone structure wise,
physically like what he can do,

2277
01:47:37,690 --> 01:47:41,080
there's like a certain amount of
horsepower at certain guys have and you

2278
01:47:41,081 --> 01:47:42,520
watch that fight.
You look at that guy,

2279
01:47:42,521 --> 01:47:44,310
the guys,
it's a fucking tank of a man.

2280
01:47:44,350 --> 01:47:47,500
Brock Lesnar,
perfect example guys takes off.

2281
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:49,420
How many years have you take off?
Like five years.

2282
01:47:49,421 --> 01:47:52,060
At least six years at least.
He fights Mark Hunt,

2283
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:55,630
roids or no roids,
whatever the fuck he tested positive for

2284
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:59,290
or anti estrogen blockers or whatever.
You just forget about all that.

2285
01:47:59,291 --> 01:48:04,291
The fact that this guy was able to fight
mark fucking hunt after five or six

2286
01:48:04,661 --> 01:48:07,960
years of no fighting,
just doing pro wrestling and then when

2287
01:48:08,410 --> 01:48:09,243
that's insane,

2288
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:11,380
you know,
I had had a bed in.

2289
01:48:11,381 --> 01:48:15,940
I'm Mark Hunt and you had told me and I
didn't know that I told you I'm casual.

2290
01:48:15,941 --> 01:48:20,080
I'm a casual fan.
I took Mark Hunt but I didn't know

2291
01:48:20,081 --> 01:48:22,720
anything about it.
And then uh,

2292
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:25,420
he walks out and I'm like,
Oh shit,

2293
01:48:25,421 --> 01:48:30,421
this motherfucker,
he's built like me to add a cash back.

2294
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:33,820
So I did not go on in my book,
My online book.

2295
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:37,390
This is before the fight stopped.
I'm trying to bet on a brock lesnar real

2296
01:48:37,391 --> 01:48:38,570
quick.
Oh,

2297
01:48:38,770 --> 01:48:41,110
that's already taken the bad data.
That was like,

2298
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:43,270
Oh man,
I didn't bet on this guy that's built

2299
01:48:43,271 --> 01:48:46,240
like me Brock Lesnar.
See,

2300
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:49,420
here's the thing though.
That's not necessarily true.

2301
01:48:49,421 --> 01:48:52,510
I know is that necessarily true,
but that was my instinct at the time,

2302
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,530
like,
oh no,

2303
01:48:53,810 --> 01:48:58,730
what brock lesnar did in a taking down
the amount of time off and then beating

2304
01:48:58,731 --> 01:49:02,090
a guy like Mark Hunt,
that's so extraordinary and he's

2305
01:49:02,091 --> 01:49:05,840
probably never going to get the credit
that he deserves because the fact that

2306
01:49:05,930 --> 01:49:08,540
one,
he was a pro wrestler and then two,

2307
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:12,340
he tested positive for this anti
estrogen blocker.

2308
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:14,330
Whatever the fuck he took.
I don't know what happened.

2309
01:49:14,450 --> 01:49:15,520
Who knows?
It could've been.

2310
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:19,490
He could've been easily been some
performance enhancing formula that he

2311
01:49:19,491 --> 01:49:22,340
bought from GNC or it could have been
something more insidious.

2312
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:26,000
Whatever the fuck it was.
The fact that this guy was able to beat

2313
01:49:26,001 --> 01:49:29,510
Mark Hunt after all those,
that time off just shows you what an

2314
01:49:29,511 --> 01:49:34,511
amazing athlete he really is.
There's no way in hell that certain guys

2315
01:49:34,581 --> 01:49:38,900
are going to catch up to that guy if
that guy just keeps working out.

2316
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:44,230
Like there's guys that like if they just
keep working out and they stay healthy

2317
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:49,600
and they stay fit and they get into the
healthy and fit with no injuries,

2318
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:50,800
which is like the primary.

2319
01:49:50,810 --> 01:49:54,100
That's just like you.
There's certain guys that you like,

2320
01:49:54,101 --> 01:49:56,470
you're in a,
you're in a world of shit.

2321
01:49:57,460 --> 01:50:02,320
If you get a guy like brock lesnar into
the ring with you and he's not her and

2322
01:50:02,321 --> 01:50:05,080
he's in great shape and he has no
injuries,

2323
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:08,800
you're in a world of shit.
You're standing in front of a Goliath of

2324
01:50:08,801 --> 01:50:12,010
a man.
A guy was a struggle to die it down.

2325
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:14,720
Two hundred and 65 pounds.
Yeah.

2326
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:17,590
It's not fair.
What about cm punk?

2327
01:50:17,591 --> 01:50:19,180
Is he good?
Is he making his debut?

2328
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:23,680
He's making his UFC debut,
but I have to respect that.

2329
01:50:23,681 --> 01:50:27,580
He did a lot of things the right way.
He went to Duke Roufus,

2330
01:50:27,581 --> 01:50:30,550
his camp in Minneapolis.
Milwaukee Rather.

2331
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:32,250
Excuse me.
You go to right now.

2332
01:50:32,251 --> 01:50:34,090
There's a lot of stuff in albuquerque.
Yeah,

2333
01:50:34,091 --> 01:50:34,691
there's a lot.
No,

2334
01:50:34,691 --> 01:50:37,060
no.
He went to Milwaukee because that's

2335
01:50:37,061 --> 01:50:39,030
where duke is it.

2336
01:50:39,070 --> 01:50:41,510
What he did was he went to one of the
best gyms in the world,

2337
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:42,580
the roof,
his sport.

2338
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:46,420
He Dick.
I'm his brother.

2339
01:50:46,450 --> 01:50:49,330
I'm Rick Rufus,
who was like a world champion kickboxer

2340
01:50:49,331 --> 01:50:54,070
that used to be on Pka karate and then
there's Duke Roufus do group as a world

2341
01:50:54,071 --> 01:50:57,950
champion more tie fighter and he's
produced like a ton of worldclass

2342
01:50:58,090 --> 01:51:00,430
fighters like Anthony Pettis,
Sergio Pettis,

2343
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,900
Tyron Woodley.
Does is tracking down there.

2344
01:51:02,930 --> 01:51:06,910
He's the new UFC welterweight champion,
so duke roufus is just like a really

2345
01:51:06,911 --> 01:51:10,720
high level camp and that's where cm punk
chose to move his camp and he,

2346
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:14,290
he lived there for like two years.
They always been doing this training was

2347
01:51:14,291 --> 01:51:17,290
signed with the UFC and he just said I'm
going to do this the right way.

2348
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:19,870
And he went through a full,
like a,

2349
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:24,310
like a long period of training,
learning skills and working under the

2350
01:51:24,311 --> 01:51:26,260
tutelage of like one of the best guys in
the world.

2351
01:51:26,290 --> 01:51:28,350
Oh,
who the fuck knows what's going to

2352
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:29,920
happen?
We really don't know.

2353
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:32,350
I mean,
I have no idea what this guy can do.

2354
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:36,160
I've seen him hit some pads.
I've seen some slow motion,

2355
01:51:36,161 --> 01:51:39,490
weird blurry videos of him sparring.
I don't know.

2356
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:43,360
I mean they might be trying to shield it
for promotional purposes.

2357
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:45,580
I mean,
he might've gotten really good.

2358
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:46,790
He might be like,
I mean,

2359
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:49,270
if the guy's willing to do that,
that's an extraordinary amount of

2360
01:51:49,271 --> 01:51:51,310
discipline that it takes to move to a
place.

2361
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:54,070
Change your life.
Lived there for two years.

2362
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,050
Just nothing but train.
I mean,

2363
01:51:56,051 --> 01:51:58,330
who the fuck knows?
But that's the big.

2364
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:02,290
The big statement is who the fuck knows?
So if you go to watch him fight,

2365
01:52:02,570 --> 01:52:06,250
it's like you're tuning in for
essentially like a spectacle and it

2366
01:52:06,251 --> 01:52:08,000
might be great and it might.
I mean we,

2367
01:52:08,050 --> 01:52:08,883
we have to see.

2368
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:12,250
He doesn't even know.
We don't know if he's ever fought.

2369
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:13,410
We don't know.
No one knows.

2370
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:16,420
No one knows what the fuck's gonna
happen fall with the people that either.

2371
01:52:16,421 --> 01:52:19,780
That's a different thing to do.
There's a big difference.

2372
01:52:19,870 --> 01:52:23,440
There's a big difference between
training and reality and you know,

2373
01:52:23,441 --> 01:52:27,220
and maybe he excels.
There's people who excel at reality

2374
01:52:27,490 --> 01:52:30,010
where they,
they look lackluster and training and

2375
01:52:30,011 --> 01:52:34,210
then they rise to the occasion of the
event and then there's other people that

2376
01:52:34,211 --> 01:52:36,880
are exact opposite what a practice.
Well,

2377
01:52:36,881 --> 01:52:40,690
and then yeah,
the anxiety of performance is real,

2378
01:52:40,691 --> 01:52:42,810
right?
Everybody is just.

2379
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:44,920
I was,
when it was a point

2380
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,260
during the,
a Ds,

2381
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:51,560
Mcgregor fight when the crowd started
chanting,

2382
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:56,890
like they were in a clench or something
in the crowded des Des des.

2383
01:52:58,620 --> 01:53:00,620
And I was just like,
what is he thinking right now?

2384
01:53:00,621 --> 01:53:02,900
Like,
what does that feel like?

2385
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:06,020
This dude is in the clench is a huge
fight.

2386
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:09,680
The headliners lunch streaming down his
face.

2387
01:53:10,370 --> 01:53:13,790
What is his pants off?
What does he feel like,

2388
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:16,580
you know,
with the crowd chanting.

2389
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:21,500
I'm like,
what is that like gladiators shit.

2390
01:53:21,501 --> 01:53:22,100
Like,
like,

2391
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:23,150
does it help?
Does it,

2392
01:53:23,151 --> 01:53:27,070
is it distracting?
Does it hype you up as they chat?

2393
01:53:27,071 --> 01:53:28,670
And uh,
it's just,

2394
01:53:28,671 --> 01:53:29,750
uh,
it's just the,

2395
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:31,920
you know,
I'm just a real good question.

2396
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:33,610
It's something I'll never,
I'll never know.

2397
01:53:33,611 --> 01:53:35,410
And it was something.
Hopefully.

2398
01:53:35,411 --> 01:53:35,920
And,
and,

2399
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,930
and you'll find out on my podcast next
week and I'm starting,

2400
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:41,180
I'll be interviewing a ideas and uh,

2401
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:45,580
man,
it's a good question in,

2402
01:53:45,690 --> 01:53:49,450
he's the only one that can answer it or
him or anyone else has experienced that.

2403
01:53:49,451 --> 01:53:50,660
Right?
Because you're talking about,

2404
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:52,820
you know,
at this new t bumble what did,

2405
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:54,680
how,
how many people isn't seat.

2406
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:58,250
I think the t mobile is like 22,000 or
so.

2407
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:00,680
Really?
It's a big ass place.

2408
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:04,550
It's way bigger than the MGM.
I don't know about how much,

2409
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:06,160
at least a few thousand dollars because
it's like,

2410
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:07,870
what is it Jamie sign?

2411
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:09,410
Because it is.
Yeah,

2412
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:11,270
people are chanting your name.
Oh my God.

2413
01:54:11,271 --> 01:54:13,280
But it's not like basketball because you
just got,

2414
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:15,890
you've been punched in the face a lot so
you didn't a little bit of pain.

2415
01:54:16,910 --> 01:54:19,370
You might be hurting that kinda tired,
you know,

2416
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:20,980
it's not just you,
you,

2417
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:22,910
you know,
just drop the three are soft and then

2418
01:54:22,911 --> 01:54:27,911
you just jogging in the clinic.
So it's like this is cool but I'm still

2419
01:54:28,821 --> 01:54:29,654
kind of uncomfort

2420
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:31,650
maybe fires you up.
How many?

2421
01:54:31,651 --> 01:54:34,320
Twenty,
$20,000 for boxing and MMA.

2422
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:36,510
Oh,
that's so many.

2423
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:41,830
That's a lot of fucking people.
So that's approximately 5,000 more than

2424
01:54:42,721 --> 01:54:44,460
the MGM.
Mgm.

2425
01:54:44,461 --> 01:54:47,940
About 15,000.
Somewhere around there I think.

2426
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:49,890
Is that why they moved them there?
Because there's more people.

2427
01:54:49,891 --> 01:54:51,690
It's just a different deal.
I don't know,

2428
01:54:51,691 --> 01:54:54,170
you know,
I just think they could sell this out to

2429
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:56,700
16.
Oh Jesus.

2430
01:54:56,701 --> 01:54:58,710
The mgms that big.
Wow.

2431
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:01,440
Oh,
so is it Mandalay bay?

2432
01:55:01,441 --> 01:55:02,790
That's 15.
Is that what it is?

2433
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:05,130
Or is that 14?
What am I asking?

2434
01:55:05,131 --> 01:55:08,340
What am I fucking census taker.
You're going to stop answering

2435
01:55:08,610 --> 01:55:10,020
questions.
Booking agent.

2436
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:12,200
What does it hold?
Wealth thousand.

2437
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:13,340
Oh shit man.
Lay based.

2438
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:15,180
Only 12,000.
Hmm.

2439
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,590
Interesting.
So,

2440
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:18,590
uh,
I guess the reason why they moved it was

2441
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:20,700
just the UFC could sell out those places
now,

2442
01:55:20,910 --> 01:55:24,000
especially for this fight.
This fight was gone.

2443
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:26,880
Damn button.
That was amazing.

2444
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:27,610
You could,
uh,

2445
01:55:27,610 --> 01:55:30,300
you could have stuck a light bulb in
your mouth and it would've started

2446
01:55:30,301 --> 01:55:31,520
glowing.
Right?

2447
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:34,800
It was electricity in the air.
I was going through our fingertips.

2448
01:55:35,010 --> 01:55:36,120
It was,
it was crazy,

2449
01:55:36,121 --> 01:55:37,440
man.
It was a good time.

2450
01:55:37,590 --> 01:55:39,310
That's why I decided to keep,
uh,

2451
01:55:39,390 --> 01:55:41,520
working for the UFC.
It's moments like that.

2452
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:46,080
The Nate Diaz Mcgregor fight.
The first one was one of the in the

2453
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:47,630
Misha tate.
Holly Holm fight me.

2454
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:50,160
She choked Holly Holm unconscious in the
fifth round.

2455
01:55:50,161 --> 01:55:52,680
It was fucking chaos.
I remember thinking,

2456
01:55:52,681 --> 01:55:54,930
how could I stop doing this?
How could I.

2457
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:56,910
I can't believe I even got this job in
the first place.

2458
01:55:57,410 --> 01:56:01,070
I get to watch this crazy shit and talk
about it from the.

2459
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:03,210
So you wouldn't know when they bought
it.

2460
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:06,120
I wasn't sure.
I just was thinking I was doing too many

2461
01:56:06,121 --> 01:56:10,050
things and then I decided bombs just
instead of just being crazy launch,

2462
01:56:10,051 --> 01:56:12,900
do less.
I'm just going to do less and doing

2463
01:56:12,901 --> 01:56:14,820
less.
It just made a big difference.

2464
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:19,880
Vape pen use after you have a man.
He's just got punched in the face of

2465
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:23,340
folks.
Relax.

2466
01:56:23,890 --> 01:56:26,520
Should be.
You should let him use it immediately

2467
01:56:26,521 --> 01:56:29,040
after it just,
let's be scientific about this.

2468
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:32,070
We all want everybody to be on the same
page.

2469
01:56:32,071 --> 01:56:33,840
We don't want people cheating.
You know,

2470
01:56:33,841 --> 01:56:36,480
if this guy,
you watched him fight five rounds,

2471
01:56:36,481 --> 01:56:39,960
there's no more contest coming up.
Let him do something that's medically

2472
01:56:39,961 --> 01:56:43,150
proven to reduce inflammation.
It's not even marijuana.

2473
01:56:43,151 --> 01:56:44,460
It's CBD oil.

2474
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:47,990
Also.
Those punches up probably way worse for

2475
01:56:47,991 --> 01:56:50,090
him than CBD oil.
Oh my God.

2476
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:51,950
It's CBD lungs.
Good for you.

2477
01:56:52,010 --> 01:56:53,180
Yeah,
exactly.

2478
01:56:53,330 --> 01:56:55,310
Especially when you have inflammation.
Yeah,

2479
01:56:55,311 --> 01:56:58,430
exactly.
Should be nate diaz get punched in the

2480
01:56:58,431 --> 01:57:01,850
face before he used cbd.
That's a really good point,

2481
01:57:01,851 --> 01:57:02,470
man.

2482
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:05,630
It is a really good point because for
someone to be that hypocritical that you

2483
01:57:05,631 --> 01:57:08,630
let a guy get punched in the head for 25
fucking minutes,

2484
01:57:08,810 --> 01:57:12,960
but you won't let them smoke a vape pen
because what you think is cheating is

2485
01:57:13,010 --> 01:57:14,150
cheating.
Death as

2486
01:57:14,770 --> 01:57:16,690
will stay alive.
Sadly with football,

2487
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:18,320
he uh,
he was smoking marijuana.

2488
01:57:18,650 --> 01:57:21,620
Football.
Football is way worse for you.

2489
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:26,080
Then we'd is worse for you.
And probably football is worse than

2490
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:28,250
cocaine.
High hip flag football.

2491
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:31,060
Yeah.
Football is probably worse for you than

2492
01:57:31,330 --> 01:57:34,120
most stuff.
Drinking out of ponds.

2493
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:39,190
Footballs.
Fucking dangerous.

2494
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:41,440
Super Dangerous Man.

2495
01:57:41,510 --> 01:57:45,500
But they just let it try to maintain a
good image about it.

2496
01:57:45,501 --> 01:57:47,420
But I don't smoke weed,
don't smoke weed,

2497
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:51,890
but you might get Hella concussions,
but don't smoke weed because that

2498
01:57:51,891 --> 01:57:53,840
doesn't look good for because we gotta
sell this.

2499
01:57:53,841 --> 01:57:55,520
But like,
I love the word hello,

2500
01:57:55,521 --> 01:57:58,000
but I'm too old to use it.
I just turned 49.

2501
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:00,080
That's what the cut off.
Just do it man.

2502
01:58:01,390 --> 01:58:04,130
You can say hello.
Say Hello.

2503
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:09,160
You're just encouraging me to say to
tell that girl asked her what her dreams

2504
01:58:09,171 --> 01:58:10,004
were.
Hannibal's

2505
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:10,890
you know,
you,

2506
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:11,900
you,
you pumped him up,

2507
01:58:11,901 --> 01:58:12,734
he pumps you up.

2508
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:17,070
You're telling me as the girl with a
dream I really wanted to ask is so bad.

2509
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:19,430
She had that vibe.
Man.

2510
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:23,910
I see a lot of bad ones.
Her vibe was crazy and they might not

2511
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:26,370
have.
And I wish I took the shot.

2512
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:28,290
Yeah,
I would've helped her with her.

2513
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:30,210
Whatever dreams my.
If I had,

2514
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:31,650
if I could.
What do you want to do?

2515
01:58:31,651 --> 01:58:33,010
You want to.
I can.

2516
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:36,000
I know somebody like that and you could
find some money.

2517
01:58:36,001 --> 01:58:37,400
If you don't know somebody finds her
mind.

2518
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:39,780
You can find something.
I wanted to because she wouldn't be hard

2519
01:58:39,781 --> 01:58:41,410
to find somebody.
I'm going to go,

2520
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:41,980
or you know what I

2521
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,510
did,
I did think about,

2522
01:58:43,570 --> 01:58:45,180
I'm a,
I saw it.

2523
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:48,530
Her name was on the receipt.
Google her name and uh,

2524
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:51,640
the restaurant name and see if she got a
linkedin page.

2525
01:58:55,300 --> 01:59:00,300
Linkedin doesn't have a linkedin page.
You sound like super rare,

2526
01:59:00,830 --> 01:59:03,520
but hey,
she seems like a waitress were way

2527
01:59:03,521 --> 01:59:08,080
bigger.
Ambitious man in La or New York actually

2528
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:09,630
more than Vegas.
Yeah.

2529
01:59:09,650 --> 01:59:13,210
It's gonna be hard because you're going
to have to take a gamble whether or not

2530
01:59:13,211 --> 01:59:16,360
she's still working there,
whether or not you know what day her

2531
01:59:16,361 --> 01:59:19,930
shifts are on Saturday,
Sunday I went back,

2532
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,440
I was there two nights,
two afternoons.

2533
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:25,840
Really stalkerish,
but we ain't say no place where you say

2534
01:59:25,841 --> 01:59:28,840
no
that stock was,

2535
01:59:28,841 --> 01:59:32,590
but I do.
I did a enjoy her energy and I would

2536
01:59:32,591 --> 01:59:34,840
help her.
I say go back.

2537
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:37,900
I would help her in a platonic go back
in a zen way,

2538
01:59:38,970 --> 01:59:43,630
like completely empty to go back and
experience like sitting in her section

2539
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:46,120
and uh,
you know,

2540
01:59:46,121 --> 01:59:46,954
just saying hi.

2541
01:59:47,290 --> 01:59:49,560
Yeah.
Seeing what's up but don't,

2542
01:59:49,561 --> 01:59:52,200
don't be like crazy about it.
I wouldn't be crazy about it,

2543
01:59:52,410 --> 01:59:53,560
just say,
hey,

2544
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:56,390
I need this.
I need to have A.

2545
01:59:56,860 --> 01:59:59,800
I've been to vegas a bunch of recently
with no shelves in Vegas,

2546
02:00:00,450 --> 02:00:05,450
not even just to.
I've been to the past to ufc things and

2547
02:00:05,711 --> 02:00:10,240
then sometimes I just another trip just
to kick it to fun place.

2548
02:00:10,390 --> 02:00:15,390
It's a strange place.
I was just in this area outside of Reno.

2549
02:00:16,030 --> 02:00:19,090
It's um,
we were about five hours outside of

2550
02:00:19,091 --> 02:00:21,610
Reno.
We were camping and doing this,

2551
02:00:21,611 --> 02:00:26,611
a hunting show and uh,
it's all in the mountains and the desert

2552
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:30,580
above Nevada.
It's somewhere in the area of where they

2553
02:00:30,581 --> 02:00:33,080
do that whole burning man thing.
Okay.

2554
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:34,780
Dude,
it was amazing.

2555
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:35,890
Who was,
who I was.

2556
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:40,690
It's me and a bunch of a camera people
and this guy,

2557
02:00:40,691 --> 02:00:43,390
Steve Rinella poster show the media we
struck out,

2558
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:48,750
but we were out there in the mountains
above Nevada to food.

2559
02:00:49,270 --> 02:00:52,900
There's a whole other world out there.
It doesn't even look real.

2560
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:55,930
I can just,
it doesn't look real.

2561
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:57,610
You go to this place.
There's no people.

2562
02:00:57,980 --> 02:01:00,960
It's just giant fucking mountains.
They go up to like a Louis.

2563
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:04,960
We were at 9,000 feet.
There's other ones that go up to 11,000

2564
02:01:04,961 --> 02:01:06,820
feet and you're looking at these things
like,

2565
02:01:06,821 --> 02:01:08,920
what the fuck?
This is Nevada,

2566
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:12,220
Nevada,
these fucking.

2567
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:15,580
That's a picture from my instagram.
That's,

2568
02:01:16,110 --> 02:01:18,730
that's Nevada dude.
That's the Nevada desert.

2569
02:01:18,970 --> 02:01:22,630
That's the what's called the high desert
is,

2570
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:25,570
like I said,
about five hours outside of Reno was

2571
02:01:25,571 --> 02:01:26,241
amazing.
Oh,

2572
02:01:26,241 --> 02:01:27,390
this was a.
This is what you,

2573
02:01:27,391 --> 02:01:29,110
uh,
is the hunting trip?

2574
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:30,041
No.
Yeah,

2575
02:01:30,041 --> 02:01:30,610
yeah,
yeah,

2576
02:01:30,610 --> 02:01:31,443
yeah.
I was there for.

2577
02:01:31,610 --> 02:01:34,630
I was there for a week.
It's a,

2578
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,180
it looks crazy.
I think we could fail.

2579
02:01:37,190 --> 02:01:40,010
You appreciate how that looks

2580
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:44,540
and I appreciate how that feels,
but I think I'm such a city dude where I

2581
02:01:44,541 --> 02:01:45,350
get to that.
Like,

2582
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:46,790
this is beautiful.
This is cool.

2583
02:01:47,410 --> 02:01:49,610
I have a couple of drinks and a check
this out.

2584
02:01:50,450 --> 02:01:52,280
All right.
Five hours.

2585
02:01:52,281 --> 02:01:53,570
We good?
Let's go back to the light.

2586
02:01:54,130 --> 02:01:57,760
I understand.
I understand that,

2587
02:01:57,761 --> 02:02:01,030
but I liked the views.
However I get antsy,

2588
02:02:01,630 --> 02:02:05,770
but you zen out smooth.
I could get antsy too.

2589
02:02:06,010 --> 02:02:09,520
I think I'm what I'm trying to do.
One of the things I'm trying to do by

2590
02:02:09,521 --> 02:02:13,810
going to these places and disconnecting
for a few days is find out what I really

2591
02:02:13,811 --> 02:02:18,040
think about things where it's just me
and my thoughts and interacting with my

2592
02:02:18,041 --> 02:02:20,860
friends.
This is one of the good things about

2593
02:02:20,861 --> 02:02:22,680
doing this show.
It's called media.

2594
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:25,330
This Guy Steve Rinella,
who's the host of it is like a really

2595
02:02:25,331 --> 02:02:26,620
smart,
really nice guy,

2596
02:02:26,650 --> 02:02:28,990
really interesting guy.
And um,

2597
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:30,760
you know,
I like hanging out with him and all of

2598
02:02:30,761 --> 02:02:32,800
his crew and his friends for like all
these days.

2599
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:35,610
So it's really fun.
So in doing that and having it being

2600
02:02:35,620 --> 02:02:37,120
really fun,
you get to relax.

2601
02:02:37,150 --> 02:02:39,210
Yeah.
And you get to just sit back and hang

2602
02:02:39,211 --> 02:02:42,610
out with these fun,
cool guys and just relax and this is

2603
02:02:42,611 --> 02:02:44,110
your world now.
This is your tribe,

2604
02:02:44,170 --> 02:02:44,771
right?
You know,

2605
02:02:44,771 --> 02:02:47,770
and he told me that before,
that had that sort of how he views it

2606
02:02:48,070 --> 02:02:48,840
like that,
it,

2607
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:53,830
that it's his tribe and a cool group of
friends and that now I understand it

2608
02:02:53,831 --> 02:02:55,050
now.
It's like it's a,

2609
02:02:55,290 --> 02:02:58,840
I think that disconnecting for awhile.
Every now and then just take,

2610
02:02:58,900 --> 02:03:01,630
take a few days off just you don't even
have to go anywhere,

2611
02:03:01,810 --> 02:03:06,810
but it's probably a good idea too to
like on purpose take a few days off of

2612
02:03:08,260 --> 02:03:11,260
anything coming in and just let's see
how you feel about things.

2613
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:16,440
Even if I'm out and about at bar or
something and my phone dies and I'm not

2614
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:21,280
charging it.
I find myself having a fine.

2615
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:24,710
I realized I'm a really strange person
when I talk to people when you get,

2616
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:28,570
when you have to really talk to people
for awhile and it's not because now

2617
02:03:28,630 --> 02:03:33,630
pretty much a lot of time if you talking
to somebody is about you talking about

2618
02:03:33,701 --> 02:03:35,050
and then as I do

2619
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:41,590
phone and so it's a break a break from
the connection

2620
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:45,320
we're using and everybody.
But if you really.

2621
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:47,870
I mean sometimes I mean on a date or
something,

2622
02:03:47,871 --> 02:03:51,320
I don't go into my shit.
So really important point.

2623
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:55,010
But yeah,
if my shit's dead and I'm just out for

2624
02:03:55,011 --> 02:03:56,960
two hours,
I find that if I'm having long

2625
02:03:56,961 --> 02:03:59,050
conversations and then I started
realizing like,

2626
02:03:59,150 --> 02:04:02,690
Oh shit,
I'm getting kind of weird and intense

2627
02:04:02,691 --> 02:04:05,170
with this person.
And I started asking because I,

2628
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:10,250
you know,
normally I will if I'm talking to

2629
02:04:10,251 --> 02:04:15,251
somebody or I'll do the bullshit regular
questions that we do,

2630
02:04:15,321 --> 02:04:17,630
the way you go to college,
you live here.

2631
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:18,600
Uh,
when did you move from?

2632
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:22,460
How long have you been doing that?
And uh,

2633
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:24,050
and then,
uh,

2634
02:04:24,230 --> 02:04:25,640
and then you,
I mean,

2635
02:04:25,641 --> 02:04:30,641
at some point if you want to read,
you got to get beyond that

2636
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:31,613
conversationally.

2637
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:36,600
Roughly we're talking roofers right
on the same page.

2638
02:04:37,070 --> 02:04:38,230
Yeah,
I rufio girl.

2639
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:42,340
Eliminate now what are your favorite?
See with imagination.

2640
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:45,210
What are your fears?
Have you ever been hypnotized?

2641
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:46,680
No.
It can be done.

2642
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:48,393
Yeah.
Yeah,

2643
02:04:48,450 --> 02:04:49,940
I believe it.
I believe it too.

2644
02:04:50,430 --> 02:04:53,970
I believe in respect to all the
hypnotists out there on the road,

2645
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:57,340
killing it.
Having people on stage doing goofy.

2646
02:04:57,341 --> 02:04:59,250
Yeah.
Have you ever seen a comedy hypnotist?

2647
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:01,260
You've already seen it live at it's
crazy,

2648
02:05:01,261 --> 02:05:03,050
right?
Like you don't believe he used to come

2649
02:05:03,051 --> 02:05:03,884
to my college?
Yeah.

2650
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:05,220
Yeah.
You don't believe it's real and then you

2651
02:05:05,221 --> 02:05:05,821
realize,
oh,

2652
02:05:05,821 --> 02:05:07,260
it is real.
It really does work.

2653
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:09,270
It works.
Nobody was just do that goofy ass shit.

2654
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:10,770
No,
it was just to do it.

2655
02:05:10,950 --> 02:05:13,140
It works in some weird way.
I don't understand it,

2656
02:05:13,650 --> 02:05:15,000
but I got hypnotized.
Escape.

2657
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:17,580
Vinny shoreman.
He's like a mental coach.

2658
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:22,580
He hypnotized me to do what is your go.
Just wanted to see if there was anything

2659
02:05:23,281 --> 02:05:26,850
that was holding back the way I was
thinking like in my thinking in the most

2660
02:05:26,851 --> 02:05:31,851
efficient and a logical way.
Am I doing the most with my time and my

2661
02:05:32,761 --> 02:05:35,820
not like,
do I have any hiccups that I'm not

2662
02:05:35,821 --> 02:05:38,430
paying attention to and the way I'm
approaching life.

2663
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:42,690
So I wanted to talk to him about that.
So I wanted to see what hypnotism really

2664
02:05:42,691 --> 02:05:45,210
yet because I've been talking about
something that I essentially don't have

2665
02:05:45,211 --> 02:05:47,850
any really real understanding of.
I just say,

2666
02:05:47,860 --> 02:05:49,620
ah,
I saw people get hypnotized at uh,

2667
02:05:49,970 --> 02:05:53,190
you know,
Frank Santos comedy show and I saw that.

2668
02:05:53,430 --> 02:05:55,560
How did I find her?
But you know what I mean?

2669
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:56,580
I found this dude,
he,

2670
02:05:56,581 --> 02:05:57,181
uh,
he does,

2671
02:05:57,181 --> 02:05:59,820
uh,
hypnotism and mental coaching for MMA

2672
02:05:59,821 --> 02:06:00,680
fighters.
Okay.

2673
02:06:01,050 --> 02:06:01,651
So,
uh,

2674
02:06:01,651 --> 02:06:02,490
it was interesting,
man.

2675
02:06:02,490 --> 02:06:03,950
It was weird.
It was like a.

2676
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:06,600
When you get hypnotized,
how long is this session?

2677
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:07,980
Sorry.
That's about an hour and a half.

2678
02:06:08,380 --> 02:06:09,670
About an hour and a half.
When,

2679
02:06:09,690 --> 02:06:13,170
when you get hypnotized,
you are aware that this person is

2680
02:06:13,171 --> 02:06:15,390
talking to you.
It's not like you're in some space

2681
02:06:15,391 --> 02:06:18,450
world,
but the world that you're living in with

2682
02:06:18,451 --> 02:06:22,140
your eyes closed in this state is a very
different world.

2683
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:25,200
It's like if this person can command
your attention,

2684
02:06:25,201 --> 02:06:28,890
your focus for a certain amount of time,
it lets all this other stuff sort of

2685
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:33,360
passed by and when the person does it
with no judgment,

2686
02:06:33,361 --> 02:06:37,200
just trying to understand the way you're
feeling and thinking you allow yourself

2687
02:06:37,201 --> 02:06:40,080
to slip in to this strange state of
mind.

2688
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:41,970
That's what it is.
It's really weird.

2689
02:06:41,971 --> 02:06:44,070
Like it'll wake up immediately.
Like if,

2690
02:06:44,071 --> 02:06:45,610
uh,
if you heard like an alarm going off,

2691
02:06:45,910 --> 02:06:50,190
like
it's not like you're drugged,

2692
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:52,620
but it's a,
I think there's a bunch of different

2693
02:06:52,621 --> 02:06:55,440
states of consciousness leading from the
dream world,

2694
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:58,950
which we all voluntarily go into every
night when we go to sleep,

2695
02:06:59,290 --> 02:07:00,660
we go on,
go to sleep,

2696
02:07:00,661 --> 02:07:02,670
we conk out and we have dreams.

2697
02:07:02,670 --> 02:07:04,980
We remember them,
we remember them,

2698
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:06,890
remember them all the time.
We,

2699
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:09,480
you know,
you have some wacky fucking idea that

2700
02:07:09,481 --> 02:07:11,070
came into your head.
Didn't make any sense.

2701
02:07:11,670 --> 02:07:15,060
And I think there's states of
consciousness from being totally awake

2702
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:19,230
fearing for your life because you're in
the middle of an earthquake to being

2703
02:07:19,231 --> 02:07:22,680
like drifting in and out of dreams.
You know,

2704
02:07:22,770 --> 02:07:25,410
where you're not sure you're there or
you're not there and you wait.

2705
02:07:25,550 --> 02:07:26,370
What was that?
Real?

2706
02:07:26,370 --> 02:07:27,480
What the fuck happened?
You know,

2707
02:07:27,481 --> 02:07:30,870
you're sitting in your car maybe at a
road stop.

2708
02:07:30,871 --> 02:07:32,760
You got a six hour drive.
You're like,

2709
02:07:32,761 --> 02:07:35,010
let me just pull over for an hour.
He was drifting.

2710
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:36,520
You're not sure if your sleep.

2711
02:07:36,850 --> 02:07:41,850
Do you ever just close my eyes and just
start seeing weird as colors and shapes

2712
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:43,590
and.
Shit,

2713
02:07:43,590 --> 02:07:45,060
not even hot.
Yeah,

2714
02:07:45,150 --> 02:07:50,150
but just I'll just close wise and then
like now it's nothing but certain times

2715
02:07:51,380 --> 02:07:55,050
it would just be weird shapes and just
different.

2716
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:59,700
It's pretty cold where your brain can
make all kinds of funky chemicals man

2717
02:08:00,390 --> 02:08:03,750
and they don't necessarily exactly know
why.

2718
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:06,960
It's not like there's a bunch of
different things that you can do to make

2719
02:08:06,961 --> 02:08:10,590
your brain produce certain chemicals
like in a row,

2720
02:08:10,591 --> 02:08:11,960
like as far as like a,
you know,

2721
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:16,560
maybe you can like skip rope for 20
minutes and do 50 deep breathing

2722
02:08:16,561 --> 02:08:20,400
exercises and you'll get into a like a
psychedelic state.

2723
02:08:20,850 --> 02:08:24,630
No one's exactly sure.
Like what the fuck it is that allows

2724
02:08:24,631 --> 02:08:28,170
people to get to certain states and
whether or not like the way your brain

2725
02:08:28,171 --> 02:08:30,510
works is the same as my brain.
Definitely.

2726
02:08:30,511 --> 02:08:31,740
No,
it doesn't make any sense.

2727
02:08:31,741 --> 02:08:33,870
Why would it be like,
we all know,

2728
02:08:33,871 --> 02:08:37,290
like I hear people saying I can't
fucking sing at all.

2729
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:40,830
I hear people saying and I hear like a
beautiful voice like we were.

2730
02:08:40,850 --> 02:08:44,790
We're walking by some people the other
night in Vegas when we were on our way

2731
02:08:44,791 --> 02:08:48,480
to go eat after the fights and then
there was a this guy and this girl,

2732
02:08:48,481 --> 02:08:50,910
they were saying they must have been a
part of some team or something like

2733
02:08:50,911 --> 02:08:51,420
that.
They might have.

2734
02:08:51,420 --> 02:08:54,450
It must have been some entertainers
because they were way too good and they

2735
02:08:54,451 --> 02:08:56,820
were saying it and they were singing
with each other and they were singing

2736
02:08:56,821 --> 02:09:00,000
with each other in harmony in this
hallway and everybody was like,

2737
02:09:00,001 --> 02:09:02,940
Holy Shit,
because they just had a sound.

2738
02:09:03,680 --> 02:09:06,350
They made this the exact that appeal to
everybody.

2739
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:11,090
That's something my wheelhouse here,
but my.

2740
02:09:11,770 --> 02:09:16,770
My brain is super sensitive to when
sounds off and sometimes you go to a.

2741
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:26,480
If you go to karaoke spot,
somebody doing karaoke and if they pick

2742
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:31,820
the rock songs and pop songs will sort
of be the exact beats,

2743
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:37,250
the hip hop songs.
The beats will have this.

2744
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:43,120
It's a different version of it or it it
just and it drives me crazy.

2745
02:09:43,701 --> 02:09:48,701
It's certain things with music like
little shifts in music that drive me

2746
02:09:50,870 --> 02:09:55,430
crazy.
I hate when songs are a,

2747
02:09:56,090 --> 02:10:01,090
I don't like when there's acoustic
versions of gangster rap songs that

2748
02:10:02,901 --> 02:10:06,510
makes.
That drives me crazy sonically in

2749
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:11,410
certain just musical things that just
pissed me.

2750
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:12,970
It just in that,
in a.

2751
02:10:13,030 --> 02:10:17,750
not in a good logical.
It's just that type of thing where I'm

2752
02:10:17,751 --> 02:10:19,940
like,
I have to leave here.

2753
02:10:20,300 --> 02:10:23,660
Yesterday by Uber driver from the
airport,

2754
02:10:24,870 --> 02:10:28,100
which I.
He was playing his own mix tape.

2755
02:10:28,101 --> 02:10:29,660
He didn't say he was playing his own mix
tape,

2756
02:10:29,661 --> 02:10:32,060
but I could feel that he was planning on
mixtape because you played the same

2757
02:10:32,061 --> 02:10:34,160
music for 40.
Oh my God.

2758
02:10:34,570 --> 02:10:39,570
The rapper name began withK ,
his name began with Kate on Uber and it

2759
02:10:40,521 --> 02:10:43,330
was bad.
It was really bad hit.

2760
02:10:43,331 --> 02:10:45,050
The beats was already,
but he's bad.

2761
02:10:45,310 --> 02:10:48,950
He had no charisma on the mic and it was
just.

2762
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:54,630
And so now I'm sitting here and I just
decided I was going to take this.

2763
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:59,150
Just take it.
Just take how angry this is making me

2764
02:10:59,690 --> 02:11:03,230
because I don't want to give him the
conversation because he wants me to be

2765
02:11:03,231 --> 02:11:05,600
a.
He wants me to say who's this?

2766
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:07,010
Anyway,
that's me.

2767
02:11:08,090 --> 02:11:09,560
Man.
You're really talented.

2768
02:11:10,610 --> 02:11:13,670
How long have you been rapping?
So I pretend I made me and him.

2769
02:11:14,050 --> 02:11:15,920
Um,
how long have you been rapping man?

2770
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:18,070
Uh,
I've just been doing it a,

2771
02:11:18,110 --> 02:11:20,060
you know,
just few years,

2772
02:11:20,061 --> 02:11:21,440
man.
Trying to get it going.

2773
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:22,500
So do you,
do you,

2774
02:11:22,501 --> 02:11:25,610
uh,
do you play this in the car all the time

2775
02:11:25,611 --> 02:11:26,960
and just listen to yourself all the
time?

2776
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:28,940
Yeah,
all the time man.

2777
02:11:28,941 --> 02:11:29,601
Just,
you know,

2778
02:11:29,601 --> 02:11:34,340
especially my favorite is when it's a 40
minute rides with somebody that just got

2779
02:11:34,341 --> 02:11:36,190
through traveling for awhile.
Yeah.

2780
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:38,960
Do how loud you playing this shit?
I'm playing man.

2781
02:11:39,010 --> 02:11:41,900
I'm pretty loud.
And you know what the loudest is?

2782
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,320
A little bit less loud than that.
That's how I play it.

2783
02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:47,290
I feel you do this your car?
Yeah man.

2784
02:11:48,030 --> 02:11:51,170
Right.
You know it was one song.

2785
02:11:51,171 --> 02:11:55,960
The Hook was a don't do it.
I'll just get to know you're talking

2786
02:11:55,970 --> 02:11:58,880
about him.
What'd he say?

2787
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:02,480
All black BMW.
All black BMW was the hook.

2788
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:04,730
All black BMW.
That was the word.

2789
02:12:04,731 --> 02:12:07,310
And the hook isn't not the melody
necessary because I didn't use any

2790
02:12:07,311 --> 02:12:09,850
magic,
but uh,

2791
02:12:10,610 --> 02:12:12,590
we wouldn't have all black BMW.
Oh,

2792
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:15,170
interesting.
No Uber bars and maybe if he changed his

2793
02:12:15,210 --> 02:12:17,580
cars,
no lyrics or no lyrics about,

2794
02:12:17,870 --> 02:12:19,820
but it was just,
I was just sitting there like,

2795
02:12:19,850 --> 02:12:24,850
what also I get that is la and I get
that people are looking for opportunity

2796
02:12:28,610 --> 02:12:29,720
and trying to make it.

2797
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:35,140
How about you play me
what you think your best one or two

2798
02:12:36,051 --> 02:12:38,360
songs is?
Oh wait a minute.

2799
02:12:38,420 --> 02:12:41,330
You to say one or two,
one or two you're going to be involved

2800
02:12:41,331 --> 02:12:44,200
in a serious conversation.
But this was swollen,

2801
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:46,520
but I made right out from my grandmom's
died.

2802
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:47,623
No,
it's like,

2803
02:12:47,630 --> 02:12:49,580
you know,
I was hanging out and I was like,

2804
02:12:49,610 --> 02:12:52,070
fuck this life.
So I wrote the song.

2805
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:55,850
Not the bad stuff,
but I feel like that should be.

2806
02:12:56,480 --> 02:12:58,280
If that's what,
if that's your songs,

2807
02:12:58,340 --> 02:13:03,340
if that was me,
that would be my perspective on a 40

2808
02:13:04,251 --> 02:13:05,780
minute ride.
Hey me ask you this.

2809
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:10,010
What if a guy plays you these two songs
and they're awesome and you're like,

2810
02:13:10,011 --> 02:13:12,650
Holy Shit,
this is really good.

2811
02:13:12,710 --> 02:13:14,630
Yeah.
Then we'd do what do I do?

2812
02:13:14,690 --> 02:13:16,700
Yeah.
Maybe say,

2813
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:20,770
uh,
in the car and when he tweeted out like

2814
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:21,650
this dude,
motherfucker,

2815
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:23,630
uber drive,
ask them go fast music.

2816
02:13:23,690 --> 02:13:24,620
Hey.
Plus again.

2817
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:26,030
Uh,
and,

2818
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:29,690
and try to push that.
If it's amazing and I am and I genuinely

2819
02:13:29,691 --> 02:13:34,050
feel it and if it's something I want to
hear getting because that's the hallmark

2820
02:13:34,051 --> 02:13:37,200
of a great song for me.
If I got to keep listening to this

2821
02:13:37,290 --> 02:13:40,680
overdose,
frank ocean just dropped a new.

2822
02:13:40,710 --> 02:13:42,190
He's dropped his new album.
Finally.

2823
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:47,640
There's a song solo on there and it's
just a simple Oregon plan.

2824
02:13:49,141 --> 02:13:53,190
He's just,
he's singing sorta saying rapping and

2825
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:54,750
it's a bunch of good songs and I
haven't,

2826
02:13:54,751 --> 02:13:56,820
but I can leave that on.
I,

2827
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:57,713
I,
I,

2828
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:59,460
I'll listen to a song.
Yeah.

2829
02:13:59,490 --> 02:14:01,740
15 times in a row.
Isn't that interesting?

2830
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:03,690
Yeah.
It's not a lot of things like that.

2831
02:14:03,691 --> 02:14:07,890
Like movies definitely aren't like that.
A comedy definitely isn't like that.

2832
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:09,620
No.
But there's something about songs.

2833
02:14:09,740 --> 02:14:13,200
I'm certain somebody though,
some stuff with comedy with me,

2834
02:14:13,201 --> 02:14:17,190
certain timing moves that people do
certain bits.

2835
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:19,830
I will rewind a moment.
People,

2836
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:21,720
my ex girlfriend,
she might have,

2837
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:25,770
she tolerated but she probably hated it.
It will be certain things like a quick,

2838
02:14:25,860 --> 02:14:30,030
a weird thing in a show and I would just
bring that shit back.

2839
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:32,790
I will bring that,
our riding that shit.

2840
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:34,740
Yeah.
10 Times.

2841
02:14:34,870 --> 02:14:38,220
That's what dice clay's career was kind
of built on is that people wanted to

2842
02:14:38,221 --> 02:14:39,630
hear the same things over and over
again.

2843
02:14:39,830 --> 02:14:42,840
What's in the ball bitch.
Oh,

2844
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:44,970
the whole audience would be screaming
it.

2845
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,780
It was like one of the first times where
was a firm yet.

2846
02:14:48,290 --> 02:14:51,660
But this type of shit,
our wine is not our wine.

2847
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:56,920
Our wearing a facial expression like a
cut to and somebody's making weird and

2848
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:01,380
if it's right,
if it's done well directed and with our

2849
02:15:01,390 --> 02:15:04,260
and that type of shit.
Just a weird line.

2850
02:15:04,890 --> 02:15:09,890
It was stuff off of uh,
Maria Bamford show lady dynamite moments

2851
02:15:09,991 --> 02:15:10,560
off of that.

2852
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:14,940
It was this moment where they broke the
fourth wall with a patent Oswald talking

2853
02:15:14,941 --> 02:15:16,950
to her about,
uh,

2854
02:15:16,951 --> 02:15:19,330
doing standup on the shell.
He was playing a character.

2855
02:15:19,331 --> 02:15:24,331
Then he broke and then that moment was
so crazy shit like that with our just is

2856
02:15:26,101 --> 02:15:29,160
certain lines.
Bojack horseman has a bunch of Shit with

2857
02:15:29,180 --> 02:15:33,780
Algiers.
I will watch the same moment 15,

2858
02:15:33,781 --> 02:15:37,510
20 times just because I just think that
little part is fun.

2859
02:15:37,511 --> 02:15:42,511
In the same with rap songs and certain
rap songs where there'll be a 22nd 32nd

2860
02:15:43,681 --> 02:15:44,730
piece.
Yeah.

2861
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:48,990
With the dude is just wrapping his ass
off and I'll just,

2862
02:15:49,050 --> 02:15:52,920
I'll listen to that for five,
10 minutes straight.

2863
02:15:52,921 --> 02:15:54,870
Just like that part.
I still,

2864
02:15:54,871 --> 02:15:57,150
I still like the whole salt,
but it's a part of it.

2865
02:15:57,450 --> 02:16:01,230
Yeah.
The drop the drop on father stretch my

2866
02:16:01,231 --> 02:16:03,960
hands by Kanye West.
Uh,

2867
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:06,000
the,
the buildup to that,

2868
02:16:06,001 --> 02:16:06,834
it's a,
it's just,

2869
02:16:06,870 --> 02:16:08,970
you know,
he sampled this Gospel Song with the

2870
02:16:08,971 --> 02:16:13,290
same side of father stretch my hands and
then there's the sample by future way.

2871
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:16,050
Like,
well if your mentor don't trust you and

2872
02:16:16,051 --> 02:16:17,790
it drops in,
that's what I walk in.

2873
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:22,080
Like it's a crazy and I'll just listen
to that if I'm driving around.

2874
02:16:22,081 --> 02:16:26,280
I just listened to that first part like
five times and there's a certain.

2875
02:16:26,281 --> 02:16:27,470
I just like,
I don't know.

2876
02:16:27,660 --> 02:16:28,910
I don't know.
Is that like a

2877
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:34,090
normal thing?
Hunter Thompson used to do that.

2878
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:36,490
When he used to write,
he used to listen to the same song,

2879
02:16:36,491 --> 02:16:39,460
like candle in the wind.
He was still like Elton John Candle in

2880
02:16:39,461 --> 02:16:41,110
the wind.
There's a video of him doing that.

2881
02:16:41,111 --> 02:16:44,830
He's sitting in front of the typewriter
and he's just writing in the same songs,

2882
02:16:44,831 --> 02:16:47,390
playing over and over again out of loop.
I've tried it before too.

2883
02:16:47,830 --> 02:16:50,710
I flew from New York to La writing the
entire way,

2884
02:16:50,711 --> 02:16:54,090
listening to crazy train by Ozzy Osborne
cable was out of this shit.

2885
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:56,290
I want to know.
I was like in a groove,

2886
02:16:56,340 --> 02:16:58,030
you know,
I don't remember what I came up with,

2887
02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:00,460
but I remember feeling like because the
song,

2888
02:17:00,461 --> 02:17:03,640
I knew what the lyrics were.
It almost became like a sort of hypnosis

2889
02:17:04,620 --> 02:17:07,420
zone.
Five hours of the same lyrics over and

2890
02:17:07,421 --> 02:17:09,790
over and over.
The whole five hours.

2891
02:17:09,910 --> 02:17:12,560
I just listened to crazy train and I
typed up,

2892
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:13,690
had some coffee,
took a leak,

2893
02:17:13,691 --> 02:17:15,240
which I got to do right now.
Bad.

2894
02:17:15,810 --> 02:17:17,950
My second podcast in a row.
I want to keep going with you,

2895
02:17:17,951 --> 02:17:21,340
but I got to Piss so bad james.
Ask them questions to animal.

2896
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:23,410
Going back.
I'm just going to freestyle rap.

2897
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:25,480
Hey,
you know what it is?

2898
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:29,170
Nobody wants that.
Am I hit live now by myself?

2899
02:17:29,230 --> 02:17:32,240
I could do anything.
I want to hit a.

2900
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:35,170
You see how my voice changes when this,
when he leave,

2901
02:17:35,530 --> 02:17:36,460
when he leaves,

2902
02:17:36,770 --> 02:17:40,070
it becomes the real meat.
We're here live on the Joe Rogan

2903
02:17:40,071 --> 02:17:41,330
experience.
You know what it is?

but I will come there.

2911
02:18:05,750 --> 02:18:07,640
I was there.
I've been there before.

2912
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:10,490
It has been good.
How long have we been talking?

2913
02:18:10,580 --> 02:18:12,890
Been talking a long ass time.
Two hours deep.

2914
02:18:13,430 --> 02:18:16,910
Two hours deep.
So check me out on tour.

2915

Hannah Montana will experience come
through because if you don't come

2916
02:18:21,981 --> 02:18:26,981
through it's going to be embarrassing
for me and my family also.

2917
02:18:28,670 --> 02:18:32,630
I uh,
bought a building and the mortgage is a,

2918
02:18:33,110 --> 02:18:34,730
is crazy.
I'm kidding.

2919
02:18:35,030 --> 02:18:36,770
I bought it cash.
Don't worry about me.

2920
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:38,210
So,

2922
02:18:41,270 --> 02:18:44,180

This is weird man,

2923
02:18:44,870 --> 02:18:49,870
because it feels like I feel so
connected but disconnected right now

2924
02:18:51,320 --> 02:18:53,870
because these cameras alive.
Joe's back,

2925
02:18:54,170 --> 02:18:56,450

02:18:59,010 --> 02:18:59,850
He'll get what?
He didn't get.

2929
02:18:59,851 --> 02:19:01,770
Weird exam.
He was very weird.

2930
02:19:01,890 --> 02:19:04,200
I got weird.
My voice changed.

2931
02:19:04,201 --> 02:19:08,040
So bad to podcast is just no Bueno.
My voice changed.

2932
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:14,220
I said I just got live.
It was with no it totally top 40 Dj.

2933
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:14,780
No,

2934
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:16,490
I was like,
what's up y'all is Hannibal.

2935
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:17,980
You know what it is?
It was just,

2936
02:19:18,030 --> 02:19:18,920
it was weird,
man.

2937
02:19:18,930 --> 02:19:21,150
My whole personality changed just
because you left.

2938
02:19:21,210 --> 02:19:22,260
I was like,
Oh shit.

2939
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:24,780
Pardon me?
Takes that as a compliment that you're

2940
02:19:24,781 --> 02:19:26,970
so comfortable.
You can be yourself when you hear.

2941
02:19:27,230 --> 02:19:28,010
Yeah.

2942
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:29,590
It was just.
It was more just.

2943
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:32,860
I don't even know that.
Yeah,

2944
02:19:32,861 --> 02:19:34,190
it's just.
I just get hyped up.

2945
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:36,800
I didn't say anything of substance
either.

2946
02:19:38,950 --> 02:19:41,960
I could have given 100 of my 800
podcasts.

2947
02:19:42,230 --> 02:19:46,510
I could have a $800 is a lot more than I
think it's like,

2948
02:19:46,550 --> 02:19:50,420
what is this one says?
Eight 36 could have given some good

2949
02:19:50,421 --> 02:19:52,040
advice.
I could have just,

2950
02:19:52,041 --> 02:19:55,340
you know,
talked about my mistakes instead I just

2951
02:19:55,341 --> 02:19:57,320
plugged tour dates.
That's a good move.

2952
02:19:57,410 --> 02:19:59,640
That's the right move plug pto date.

2953
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:04,410
People need to see you anyway and it's a
Hannibal Montana Bowl.

2954
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:08,310
The Hannibal Montana blue experience,
and if they just Google Hannibal

2955
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:09,860
Montana,
double goal.

2956
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:11,940
My goal,
my twitter go on facebook,

2957
02:20:12,260 --> 02:20:13,093
a

2958
02:20:13,810 --> 02:20:16,630
new instagram thing where you could take
like a video of your day.

2959
02:20:16,820 --> 02:20:21,050
You do all the stories.
I got to get a young person around me

2960
02:20:21,051 --> 02:20:23,330
all the time.
I can do it,

2961
02:20:23,331 --> 02:20:27,360
but I don't wanna I don't wanna do that.
I get the value of doing that.

2962
02:20:27,361 --> 02:20:28,770
I understand,
but I don't want to.

2963
02:20:28,771 --> 02:20:31,550
It's the same for the same reason.
Different,

2964
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:33,050
uh,
different,

2965
02:20:33,110 --> 02:20:35,690
different things that I didn't get
pokemon go.

2966
02:20:36,250 --> 02:20:37,910
Oh yeah.
Because it sounded.

2967
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:39,440
It sounds fun.
And what?

2968
02:20:39,450 --> 02:20:42,370
A friend of mine,
she had it on her phone and I messed up.

2969
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:46,190
This is fun,
but I don't want to be on my phone that

2970
02:20:46,191 --> 02:20:47,720
much.
So I just got to have a,

2971
02:20:47,870 --> 02:20:52,870
some internet savvy.
Twenty five year old around me all the

2972
02:20:53,211 --> 02:20:55,760
time.
Mr Burns test be.

2973
02:20:56,890 --> 02:20:58,430
I said.
Oh Shit.

2974
02:20:58,460 --> 02:21:00,620
I just said Internet savvy.
Twenty five year old.

2975
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:03,651
No,
I hope.

2976
02:21:03,651 --> 02:21:06,040
Make it a.
What if she was so hot and you like,

2977
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:08,600
we can work this out so hot.
Nope.

2978
02:21:08,660 --> 02:21:12,500
Little ridiculous cartoon.
Tiny waist in the ass.

2979
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:16,580
Like a fucking box of chocolates.
Heart-Shaped Valentine's Day.

2980
02:21:16,581 --> 02:21:20,600
Box of chocolate.
What kind of assets that Jason does not

2981
02:21:20,601 --> 02:21:25,010
fair dishonor avenue.
Describe to someone an unfair recently

2982
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:26,050
and she's cool.
She's likes.

2983
02:21:26,690 --> 02:21:27,381
She's like,
Hannibal,

2984
02:21:27,381 --> 02:21:29,690
I don't give a fuck baby.
I don't give a fuck.

2985
02:21:30,170 --> 02:21:32,990
I'm not here for long time.
I'm here for good time and you're like,

2986
02:21:32,991 --> 02:21:34,880
let's do this.
What are you talking about?

2987
02:21:35,300 --> 02:21:37,970
He told my,
my employee and longtime good sap.

2988
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:43,450
You gotta keep it.
Yeah.

2989
02:21:43,510 --> 02:21:46,550
Who Tonic plutonic.
You got to keep it all.

2990
02:21:46,610 --> 02:21:49,900
Work oriented.
Some work oriented is 10 sessions.

2991
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:52,310
Times Professional.
Yeah.

2992
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:54,210
Well,
it's weird seat.

2993
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:57,540
The idea of people working alongside
each other day in day out,

2994
02:21:57,541 --> 02:22:00,360
men and women,
all group together in these boxes is

2995
02:22:00,361 --> 02:22:03,840
entirely unnatural.
When people would be around each other

2996
02:22:03,841 --> 02:22:05,820
in the wild,
they would do it because they liked each

2997
02:22:05,821 --> 02:22:10,170
other.
I am completely back in his day.

2998
02:22:10,171 --> 02:22:11,940
Did I never lived in.
Yeah.

2999
02:22:12,190 --> 02:22:16,770
My obsession is in the genetic
propensity that we have inherited from

3000
02:22:16,771 --> 02:22:19,740
these people and I think that in the
wild,

3001
02:22:19,980 --> 02:22:21,840
men and women never like grouped up
together.

3002
02:22:21,841 --> 02:22:25,650
They didn't like each other but in work
they do and it creates this weird

3003
02:22:25,651 --> 02:22:26,070
tension

3004
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:29,780
where management proved themselves and
women are trying to prove themselves and

3005
02:22:29,790 --> 02:22:32,300
no group pond back there.
It's all about growth.

3006
02:22:32,850 --> 02:22:34,170
It's groupon now,
man.

3007
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:35,990
And you,
you,

3008
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,340
you,
you didn't get lucky back then.

3009
02:22:38,420 --> 02:22:41,550
Like back then you just decided you're
going to hang out with certain people

3010
02:22:41,850 --> 02:22:43,710
and the other ones who killed.
Yeah,

3011
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:46,380
right back there.
It was no waiting it out.

3012
02:22:46,540 --> 02:22:49,620
Now there's no way to know.
Just waited it out late night and just

3013
02:22:49,621 --> 02:22:52,940
hung out at the bar and in some got
popping those,

3014
02:22:52,970 --> 02:22:54,930
none of that.
It was just either she liked you because

3015
02:22:54,931 --> 02:22:58,970
you were just strong and you brought
food and killed it.

3016
02:22:59,500 --> 02:23:03,800
You see them like you at out.
You develop the first catapult tall

3017
02:23:04,390 --> 02:23:07,740
towards the enemy or you will.
Small Dude that she didn't pay attention

3018
02:23:07,741 --> 02:23:12,741
to and then out of nowhere out of an act
of jealousy and stepping up,

3019
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:19,640
you killed the big dude and he is small,
but I guess he's the Alpha now climbed

3020
02:23:20,341 --> 02:23:22,560
on top of his neck and took out a conch
shell.

3021
02:23:26,410 --> 02:23:28,390
Now you just find something you're good
at and the cliffs,

3022
02:23:28,391 --> 02:23:30,880
the people in the fucking boats,
they let their torches up.

3023
02:23:31,660 --> 02:23:34,860
You find something you're good at and
you work hard and you can get women from

3024
02:23:34,861 --> 02:23:37,750
net.
This trick shot pool players didn't get

3025
02:23:37,751 --> 02:23:39,520
Hella Pussy.
Damn.

3026
02:23:39,730 --> 02:23:43,440
That should be another meme trick shot
pool players.

3027
02:23:43,720 --> 02:23:48,720
Hello Pussy.
There's a world where everybody mouth

3028
02:23:50,220 --> 02:23:51,610
there is for sure.
Well,

3029
02:23:51,611 --> 02:23:55,150
there was always like a pool player
groupies that would,

3030
02:23:55,151 --> 02:23:57,340
uh,
girls who were really good at pool.

3031
02:23:57,490 --> 02:23:59,560
That would date dudes that were really
good at pool.

3032
02:24:00,070 --> 02:24:00,903
Yeah.
Yeah.

3033
02:24:01,240 --> 02:24:03,310
But dudes that really good.
Could it pool?

3034
02:24:04,530 --> 02:24:06,590
They think it will translate.
Nah,

3035
02:24:06,600 --> 02:24:10,300
it's not even that man put the ball in
that hole that he could put his balls

3036
02:24:10,301 --> 02:24:13,420
and weighted balls.
Shit all talk.

3037
02:24:13,480 --> 02:24:18,480
But I think a couple of my podcasts ball
talk by Hannah Ball.

3038
02:24:20,620 --> 02:24:21,390
I like it.

3039
02:24:21,390 --> 02:24:23,740
I am starting a podcast.
Are you for real?

3040
02:24:23,741 --> 02:24:24,970
Yeah.
Would I be on it?

3041
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:27,850
Of course.
It's going to be a road podcast and

3042
02:24:27,851 --> 02:24:30,250
we'll see if that continues.
Let's do a gig together.

3043
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:35,160
Let's do a get together
on this tour that's.

3044
02:24:35,230 --> 02:24:36,910
Do a gig together.
Tell me when.

3045
02:24:36,911 --> 02:24:39,530
Man,
let's hop in.

3046
02:24:39,580 --> 02:24:41,380
Let's start with Kalamazoo,
Michigan.

3047
02:24:41,740 --> 02:24:43,450
Holy Shit.
Listen man,

3048
02:24:43,451 --> 02:24:45,400
I would be very happy to do a Gig with
you.

3049
02:24:46,540 --> 02:24:48,160
We have a lot of time.
A lot of good times.

3050
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:49,700
Yeah.
You know,

3051
02:24:49,720 --> 02:24:52,780
man,
it's one of the crazy things about the

3052
02:24:52,781 --> 02:24:55,150
comedy store is that we all get to hang
out together.

3053
02:24:55,450 --> 02:24:57,790
We're,
we never would really work together that

3054
02:24:57,791 --> 02:24:59,890
much in real life.
Like if you go on the road,

3055
02:24:59,891 --> 02:25:01,990
you take a dude with you to open,
you know,

3056
02:25:01,991 --> 02:25:04,630
everywhere we go,
we take people with us to open or we

3057
02:25:04,660 --> 02:25:06,440
have a local guy that we know we have
come on,

3058
02:25:06,550 --> 02:25:09,700
we never get to be all together.
You can go to the comedy store any

3059
02:25:09,701 --> 02:25:12,630
night.
It'd be like you and D as in Burger and

3060
02:25:12,740 --> 02:25:15,880
res is.
There's no place like that.

3061
02:25:15,881 --> 02:25:16,500
Man.
It's fun,

3062
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:19,210
man.
I love watching Rose Battle,

3063
02:25:19,211 --> 02:25:20,920
the comedy store.
It's the greatest thing ever.

3064
02:25:21,010 --> 02:25:22,840
I love.
It's just a,

3065
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:24,100
the energy in that

3066
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:25,860
room.
[inaudible] little ass belly.

3067
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:28,060
Rome hunted some people.
It's packed in there.

3068
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:31,900
They got to keep it in that fucking room
to fight it off.

3069
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:34,660
Just fight it off.
No matter what they say about that main

3070
02:25:34,661 --> 02:25:35,830
room.
Togo in there,

3071
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:37,410
that's not the place.
It's not.

3072
02:25:37,430 --> 02:25:38,670
It's not the place for it.
I mean,

3073
02:25:38,910 --> 02:25:42,940
I went to the TV taping in Montreal.
Oh,

3074
02:25:42,941 --> 02:25:45,160
you got some feelings about it.
How did you feel about it?

3075
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:47,790
I just feel about it.
I felt good about it.

3076
02:25:47,791 --> 02:25:49,330
I enjoy it.
I mean,

3077
02:25:49,420 --> 02:25:54,160
I enjoy.
I'm also biased because I've seen it.

3078
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:57,760
I think my first time there was maybe
two years ago,

3079
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:01,510
right close to that in the belly room.
So,

3080
02:26:01,640 --> 02:26:02,440
and,
and,

3081
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:04,930
and I've seen even within the belly
room,

3082
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:09,880
different things they've done to the
show in that just different things with

3083
02:26:09,881 --> 02:26:12,410
the djs are with the wave,
with the,

3084
02:26:12,810 --> 02:26:16,720
with uh,
with the racist over there and tweaks

3085
02:26:16,721 --> 02:26:20,530
that they've made in there to make the
show work.

3086
02:26:20,950 --> 02:26:25,360
And so to see something that you've been
to a bunch of times in this small space

3087
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:27,740
and then see it,
you know,

3088
02:26:27,790 --> 02:26:30,790
be in the beat in the same spot,
watching it live.

3089
02:26:31,750 --> 02:26:34,060
It's,
it's cool to see something like that,

3090
02:26:34,061 --> 02:26:37,420
to see that type of progression.
It felt,

3091
02:26:37,480 --> 02:26:38,920
it felt amazing,
man.

3092
02:26:38,921 --> 02:26:40,870
Just tell her mine,
I like it better now.

3093
02:26:41,430 --> 02:26:44,980
Do Madison Square Garden.
But yeah,

3094
02:26:44,981 --> 02:26:47,890
the space always has to be to be right
in this,

3095
02:26:47,891 --> 02:26:50,560
uh,
it's uh,

3096
02:26:51,130 --> 02:26:53,650
it's different.
That was like a motivational speech for

3097
02:26:53,651 --> 02:26:55,160
expanding your theater side.
Yeah,

3098
02:26:55,700 --> 02:26:56,990
that was really strong.
He was,

3099
02:26:57,030 --> 02:26:58,360
it is.
So it was just,

3100
02:26:58,540 --> 02:27:00,580
it was cool to see that.
And it was.

3101
02:27:01,270 --> 02:27:02,990
Yeah.
I don't think I've had the,

3102
02:27:03,370 --> 02:27:08,370
I've seen that with a comedians or
friends of mine,

3103
02:27:10,990 --> 02:27:13,450
that type of progression from,
you know,

3104
02:27:14,030 --> 02:27:17,140
over Micah to middle atrophy,
Jack to somebody,

3105
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:19,150
you know,
being on shows and being famous,

3106
02:27:19,540 --> 02:27:21,130
but I never saw that with.

3107
02:27:21,410 --> 02:27:23,830
I can't think of.
I saw that with a show concept.

3108
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:28,000
Maybe have a couple,
but just something I attended regularly

3109
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:33,550
to see it go from a live show and go
there and enjoy it as a live show and

3110
02:27:33,551 --> 02:27:34,830
then,
you know,

3111
02:27:35,020 --> 02:27:38,710
have it be live on comedy central.
That was something cool.

3112
02:27:38,860 --> 02:27:41,650
I enjoy watching that now.
I was really happy for them.

3113
02:27:41,890 --> 02:27:42,521
Yeah.
No,

3114
02:27:42,521 --> 02:27:43,810
I,
I completely agree.

3115
02:27:43,811 --> 02:27:45,340
All jokes aside,
I mean,

3116
02:27:45,341 --> 02:27:46,174
I think,
uh,

3117
02:27:46,180 --> 02:27:49,090
what they've managed to do by getting
that show on the air,

3118
02:27:49,091 --> 02:27:51,910
it's pretty monumental because there's a
god damn brutal show,

3119
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:52,900
right?
Yeah.

3120
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:55,900
What's the devil webpage up to comedy
central website.

3121
02:27:56,080 --> 02:28:00,670
They have a webpage for that show.
Are they going to do a bunch of them?

3122
02:28:02,010 --> 02:28:04,800
I think they're going to do it again.
[inaudible] dot com slash heroes.

3123
02:28:04,820 --> 02:28:06,940
But we see it.
Can I see what the page looks like?

3124
02:28:07,960 --> 02:28:09,710
Who's the champion?
Michael Lawrence.

3125
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:10,800
Mark Lawrence.
You know my,

3126
02:28:11,370 --> 02:28:12,011
um,
yeah,

3127
02:28:12,011 --> 02:28:13,390
I know him from the store.
I've seen them around.

3128
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:15,010
Great.
He's super funny.

3129
02:28:15,070 --> 02:28:18,730
Super great writer to have all four
episodes up for free.

3130
02:28:18,760 --> 02:28:20,590
You don't even have to have scroll down
a little bit.

3131
02:28:20,770 --> 02:28:22,010
Go in and have

3132
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:23,450
the bracket.
Yep.

3133
02:28:24,530 --> 02:28:26,450
Now how many different hosts are they
going to have?

3134
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:27,380
What are they going to do for

3135
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:32,630
the host is always is Jeff Ross
and uh,

3136
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:34,260
yeah.
Brian Moses.

3137
02:28:34,500 --> 02:28:37,330
Moses who is awesome by the way.
Probably Moses.

3138
02:28:37,750 --> 02:28:41,340
I'm so happy for that dude.
He such a good dude so they're not gonna

3139
02:28:41,360 --> 02:28:44,380
fuck with it.
So it's gonna basically be in the same

3140
02:28:44,381 --> 02:28:46,930
state that it's always been in sort of
racist.

3141
02:28:46,990 --> 02:28:49,680
They can have the racist.
See,

3142
02:28:49,990 --> 02:28:52,420
here's my only feeling.
This is my only feeling.

3143
02:28:52,570 --> 02:28:54,790
I don't have a problem with them doing.
I don't have a problem with anything,

3144
02:28:55,060 --> 02:28:58,090
but I wouldn't suggest them filming
those shows.

3145
02:28:58,270 --> 02:29:01,840
I would suggest them doing those shows
at filming.

3146
02:29:01,841 --> 02:29:06,841
The family room shows there is a.
there's a world in that room when when

3147
02:29:07,961 --> 02:29:11,170
someone's killing,
like when earl came out for that rose

3148
02:29:11,171 --> 02:29:14,860
paddle thing and just destroyed.
Remember that night he came out with a

3149
02:29:14,861 --> 02:29:17,200
fur coat on?
We did you see that on comedy central?

3150
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:21,130
Do they filmed it and it was.
It was a magic because there's 90 people

3151
02:29:21,131 --> 02:29:23,920
in there and they smushed slight scar
sardines packed.

3152
02:29:23,921 --> 02:29:27,760
It's a vibe in the EU,
you everything has to be in line when

3153
02:29:27,761 --> 02:29:31,390
you're killing,
there's a frequency you have to hit and

3154
02:29:31,420 --> 02:29:35,640
earl was just on that frequency and when
you see someone do something like that

3155
02:29:35,641 --> 02:29:37,870
in a small room,
you realize that's the value of the

3156
02:29:37,871 --> 02:29:39,120
smaller room.
Yeah.

3157
02:29:39,220 --> 02:29:40,980
What a small room is.
Is that.

3158
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:41,840
Yeah,
yeah,

3159
02:29:42,550 --> 02:29:44,260
yes.
This is a video of those guys,

3160
02:29:44,820 --> 02:29:46,550
but when,
when you're in a small [inaudible],

3161
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:50,580
when you're in a small room like that
and you just let it all hang out,

3162
02:29:50,970 --> 02:29:55,950
there's a weird fucking energy that
there's a weird connection to that.

3163
02:29:55,951 --> 02:29:59,130
It's different than anything else.
It's way different than a big place,

3164
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:02,250
like a big place as nice.
It's beautiful to be there.

3165
02:30:02,370 --> 02:30:05,700
It's cool to be a part of like 10,000
people came to see Rose Battle.

3166
02:30:05,701 --> 02:30:06,534
Yay.
So,

3167
02:30:06,570 --> 02:30:11,570
but the best show is that 90 seat belly
room or 80 seat,

3168
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:13,440
whatever the fuck it is.
Fire codes.

3169
02:30:13,990 --> 02:30:17,020
One of the best jokes I've heard there,
I was,

3170
02:30:17,021 --> 02:30:22,021
I could remember this comedian's name,
but it's Ah,

3171
02:30:22,170 --> 02:30:23,030
you know,
you have a,

3172
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:28,080
a joke does new.
That sounds like it's from the fifties

3173
02:30:28,511 --> 02:30:31,870
or sixties.
They just instructure and brevity.

3174
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:33,980
This,
uh,

3175
02:30:34,080 --> 02:30:36,880
this guy,
he says that his girl,

3176
02:30:36,881 --> 02:30:41,320
he says she's in an on and off
relationship.

3177
02:30:41,321 --> 02:30:46,321
Whatever boyfriend is on when he sees
her body off when he sees her face.

3178
02:30:49,330 --> 02:30:52,900
Oh Shit.
I like that you.

3179
02:30:53,330 --> 02:30:54,400
Because I'm like,
that sounds like.

3180
02:30:55,330 --> 02:30:57,660
It sounds like you heard it before,
but you didn't.

3181
02:30:57,730 --> 02:30:59,080
I haven't heard it before.
No,

3182
02:30:59,081 --> 02:31:02,130
I never heard it before,
but it's short.

3183
02:31:02,380 --> 02:31:06,330
I sound like I sound like some old shit.
Your uncle would say we never.

3184
02:31:06,790 --> 02:31:08,270
That was a fucking.
You know what I mean?

3185
02:31:08,310 --> 02:31:11,590
I've heard many great jokes that.
But that one just stuck in my head.

3186
02:31:12,180 --> 02:31:15,990
They just found the eighth ever.
Tyrannosaurus rex skull in Montana.

3187
02:31:16,290 --> 02:31:19,920
That's right up there with that.
People find sometimes and like,

3188
02:31:19,921 --> 02:31:20,130
why

3189
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:23,910
has no one found this skull?
They just didn't know when I saw that

3190
02:31:23,911 --> 02:31:25,680
combination of words.
That's perfect.

3191
02:31:25,970 --> 02:31:27,690
Uh,
meanwhile there's some dude right now in

3192
02:31:27,691 --> 02:31:29,980
the midwest screaming.
That's my big,

3193
02:31:30,030 --> 02:31:34,770
big motherfucking bed going crazy.
Somebody might've come up with that and

3194
02:31:34,771 --> 02:31:36,540
we don't even know.
We just never heard it.

3195
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:39,510
They might be an open mic or that
might've come up with it three solid

3196
02:31:39,511 --> 02:31:41,700
weeks ago.
Might've put it on youtube.

3197
02:31:42,870 --> 02:31:45,990
We might be fucked here these days.
Man.

3198
02:31:47,050 --> 02:31:49,350
I saw a bunch of Ryan lochte.
T jokes.

3199
02:31:49,570 --> 02:31:50,490
Yeah.
That dude's name.

3200
02:31:50,970 --> 02:31:52,830
Take the same joke over and over and
over again.

3201
02:31:52,890 --> 02:31:54,810
It's.
I was on twitter getting robbed.

3202
02:31:54,870 --> 02:31:57,420
Yeah,
about him lying.

3203
02:31:57,550 --> 02:31:58,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

3204
02:31:58,170 --> 02:31:59,970
Like now it'd be a good time to rob
them.

3205
02:32:00,170 --> 02:32:02,610
I saw that.
Like for like everybody,

3206
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:06,360
everybody would think that.
Did anybody do jokes about getting his

3207
02:32:06,480 --> 02:32:08,510
sponsorships?
Endorsement deals that seemed like

3208
02:32:08,530 --> 02:32:09,510
either get dropped.

3209
02:32:09,570 --> 02:32:11,940
They dropped,
they dropped a bunch of them today and

3210
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:15,800
so part of me that he won for a body
hair removal one.

3211
02:32:16,440 --> 02:32:19,020
Wait a minute.
Okay,

3212
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:23,620
so they look them for people.
So shout out to speed up speed speedo.

3213
02:32:23,630 --> 02:32:24,830
First of all,
speedo.

3214
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:29,250
Hey everybody that wants to wait.
Your Shit isn't in great shape.

3215
02:32:29,400 --> 02:32:31,860
So how about you look at me.
Animal Birds.

3216
02:32:32,190 --> 02:32:36,720
That's a good point.
Successful Samsung representative also

3217
02:32:36,721 --> 02:32:38,930
got some other stuff coming up.
That's where a lot of things,

3218
02:32:39,460 --> 02:32:44,220
many irons in the fire.
I have a horrible lifestyle.

3219
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:47,220
Horrible health,
great skin.

3220
02:32:47,250 --> 02:32:49,200
I look great on camera.
Good smile.

3221
02:32:49,320 --> 02:32:50,700
Speedo.
People like me.

3222
02:32:50,730 --> 02:32:53,490
I let people in the eyes when I talked
to them and shake their hands and I

3223
02:32:53,491 --> 02:32:56,940
always look in the eyes when I do shots
towards neon orange,

3224
02:32:57,030 --> 02:32:59,680
speedo speedos.
Who else did Ryan lochte?

3225
02:32:59,681 --> 02:33:01,990
They lose anybody else to run like the
law.

3226
02:33:02,320 --> 02:33:03,480
Also,
first of all,

3227
02:33:03,510 --> 02:33:04,920
I've been in Brazil.
Never had a problem.

3228
02:33:05,130 --> 02:33:08,280
First of all,
he shouldn't have lied about that.

3229
02:33:08,310 --> 02:33:10,820
It would seem like something he didn't
need to lie about De.

3230
02:33:11,220 --> 02:33:15,990
Also fuck swimmers being celebrated like
that.

3231
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:17,370
Oh,
I like it.

3232
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:18,670
That just celebrated.
Knows.

3233
02:33:18,680 --> 02:33:20,460
I wish to like walkers would be
celebrated.

3234
02:33:20,700 --> 02:33:22,560
I wish we could figure out what is
walking.

3235
02:33:22,590 --> 02:33:27,180
Who can walk the fastest Walker,
who can celebrate it all?

3236
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:28,980
Stay alive.
Who's swimming?

3237
02:33:29,010 --> 02:33:32,100
We could have a hold her breath or
Olympics where people hold their breath

3238
02:33:32,101 --> 02:33:33,720
the longest.
Let's do that too.

3239
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:38,360
To have like a swimming.
It's too many strokes to throw rocks.

3240
02:33:38,361 --> 02:33:41,850
It's too many strokes.
The furthest row strokes I respect.

3241
02:33:41,910 --> 02:33:43,710
I respect this.
Whatever.

3242
02:33:43,711 --> 02:33:46,950
This is the regular.
I respect this.

3243
02:33:46,951 --> 02:33:48,960
What is the regular.
I don't even know what it's prevalent,

3244
02:33:48,990 --> 02:33:52,410
but when you get into this freestyle,
when you get into this,

3245
02:33:52,530 --> 02:33:53,380
I can't fuck with the.

3246
02:33:53,380 --> 02:33:54,960
Okay.
For the people that are just listening

3247
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:58,400
regular as you're throwing your arms
over the head like you see in the.

3248
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:01,500
When you're doing your shoulders with
the goofy shit and swimming like that.

3249
02:34:01,510 --> 02:34:05,940
The the fly struck the breast stroke,
breast stroke.

3250
02:34:05,941 --> 02:34:10,941
Nobody cares that Michael Phelps got 22
gold medals.

3251
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:13,860
Yeah,
but a buzzard of we're swimming like a

3252
02:34:13,861 --> 02:34:17,010
goofy ass hole that nobody slips.
Like get Outta here.

3253
02:34:17,020 --> 02:34:20,050
He's not the greatest Olympian.
He's swims and water.

3254
02:34:20,380 --> 02:34:21,400
Damn,
that's a good point.

3255
02:34:22,060 --> 02:34:24,040
That here's what the good point.
Someone shit themselves.

3256
02:34:24,041 --> 02:34:26,320
How many times you got to swim away from
danger.

3257
02:34:27,310 --> 02:34:30,640
One of the walkers shit themselves.
How often do you have to swim away from

3258
02:34:30,641 --> 02:34:32,530
danger?
You might save a couple of laps.

3259
02:34:32,860 --> 02:34:35,080
Usain bolt,
he goes save some lives.

3260
02:34:35,081 --> 02:34:38,890
He can run fast in there.
I got I got out or somebody is attacking

3261
02:34:38,891 --> 02:34:39,641
them.
I'm out of him.

3262
02:34:39,641 --> 02:34:40,900
You're saying but.
But you,

3263
02:34:40,901 --> 02:34:43,060
you,
you usually not around water like that

3264
02:34:43,061 --> 02:34:45,190
to get away from danger.
Hm.

3265
02:34:47,340 --> 02:34:48,120
Well,
here's the point,

3266
02:34:48,120 --> 02:34:51,060
like why so many strokes?
Why limit the way you move?

3267
02:34:51,780 --> 02:34:54,180
Like if you're going to swim,
like why do you have to swim at a very

3268
02:34:54,181 --> 02:34:57,240
specific way?
If this breast stroke thing was so

3269
02:34:57,241 --> 02:34:59,880
fucking good,
would it be the fastest way to do this?

3270
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:01,070
Why don't we.
Let's.

3271
02:35:01,130 --> 02:35:04,050
Let's pretend.
Let's pretend this is the only shitty

3272
02:35:04,051 --> 02:35:07,020
way we know how to swim.
Let's just fucking throw our arms in

3273
02:35:07,021 --> 02:35:09,000
front of ourselves like we're part in
the curtains,

3274
02:35:09,180 --> 02:35:13,590
like those beads at the porno section of
the video store before there were dvrs

3275
02:35:13,870 --> 02:35:17,430
and and dvds and you.
Pardon

3276
02:35:18,040 --> 02:35:20,580
how those days,
they going to have the fucking breast

3277
02:35:20,620 --> 02:35:22,750
stroke.
They don't have this stroke.

3278
02:35:23,550 --> 02:35:27,280
If they don't have this,
then why not just have a fucking Olympic

3279
02:35:27,281 --> 02:35:30,730
competition where you just run,
but you hide me and the whole time too.

3280
02:35:30,731 --> 02:35:31,630
Very good.
Passionate.

3281
02:35:31,690 --> 02:35:34,660
Let's have backwards running.
If you've got the backstroke wise,

3282
02:35:34,661 --> 02:35:36,700
there's no backwards running in the
Olympics

3283
02:35:36,790 --> 02:35:39,340
from now on,
we should call that that move the porn

3284
02:35:39,341 --> 02:35:41,860
section.
That is you partying.

3285
02:35:41,861 --> 02:35:44,770
The beads that are hanging.
I bet when they fucking.

3286
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:47,740
When when video games went under or
excuse me,

3287
02:35:47,741 --> 02:35:52,540
a videos video rentals went under.
I bet the bead industry dropped

3288
02:35:52,541 --> 02:35:55,360
substantially.
I've been a big part of their profits

3289
02:35:55,510 --> 02:35:58,870
was beating off the porn sections.
I'm dating myself here,

3290
02:35:59,140 --> 02:36:01,540
but you guys don't even understand.
You guys are both young guns.

3291
02:36:01,900 --> 02:36:04,060
When I was a boy,
when I was a boy,

3292
02:36:05,510 --> 02:36:08,110
you could rent videos and you could rent
porn videos.

3293
02:36:08,170 --> 02:36:12,370
That's how I going go to the get drunk
and leave for me for one minute.

3294
02:36:12,610 --> 02:36:15,670
Drunkenly Oh,
when I was kid,

3295
02:36:16,370 --> 02:36:19,000
Hannibal burress can't handle his
bladder.

3296
02:36:19,001 --> 02:36:23,830
I guess
I hung in there.

3297
02:36:23,831 --> 02:36:24,820
Folks.
I did my best,

3298
02:36:25,150 --> 02:36:29,770
but Louis Theroux during that podcast
with him for three hours and then I have

3299
02:36:30,160 --> 02:36:32,080
some water,
like an asshole in between.

3300
02:36:32,760 --> 02:36:34,510
Couldn't hang in there folks.
I'm so sorry.

3301
02:36:36,670 --> 02:36:37,840
What?
We're just talking about Jamie.

3302
02:36:37,900 --> 02:36:38,733
Were you paying attention?

3303
02:36:39,390 --> 02:36:41,210
What?
What?

3304
02:36:42,580 --> 02:36:44,890
God dammit.
Olympics.

3305
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:46,120
Swimming.
Swimming.

3306
02:36:46,170 --> 02:36:47,830
Well,
limiting your movement.

3307
02:36:47,980 --> 02:36:50,770
Is it ridiculous?
Like the idea that someone's going to

3308
02:36:50,771 --> 02:36:51,430
say,
okay,

3309
02:36:51,430 --> 02:36:53,650
you can swim,
but he can't swim at your best.

3310
02:36:54,370 --> 02:36:56,500
Swimming some goofy way.
That's not efficient.

3311
02:36:57,160 --> 02:36:57,993
Go ahead.
Try that.

3312
02:36:58,150 --> 02:37:02,100
Because if somebody could just do breast
stroke only versus a freestyle swimmer,

3313
02:37:02,110 --> 02:37:03,070
they would never win.
Right?

3314
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:04,360
Yeah,

3315
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:05,193
no way.
Right?

3316
02:37:05,740 --> 02:37:07,120
Why?
Mostly Olympic events.

3317
02:37:07,121 --> 02:37:09,910
Our events that we're looking at.
Any way I'm confused.

3318
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:13,300
Well,
I'm a super big fan of curling,

3319
02:37:13,301 --> 02:37:14,770
so I'm gonna tell you to fuck off.
Right?

3320
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:16,040
You

3321
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:19,330
ever watch that,
like the panel will you ever see curling

3322
02:37:19,331 --> 02:37:21,130
and years ago and everyone else got
excited about it?

3323
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:23,880
The Winter Olympic sport.
I was in a,

3324
02:37:24,010 --> 02:37:26,590
I think it was newfoundland,
new found land,

3325
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:29,380
Newfoundland for Gig.
Yeah.

3326
02:37:29,530 --> 02:37:30,460
Yeah.
Great time.

3327
02:37:30,461 --> 02:37:32,950
Nice people when long time ago.
Yeah,

3328
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:37,840
no them for killed back Newfoundland
recently to do it.

3329
02:37:37,870 --> 02:37:38,890
I would totally do it.
Oh,

3330
02:37:38,891 --> 02:37:40,590
why haven't you done it to do weird
shit.

3331
02:37:41,500 --> 02:37:43,440
It's been.
There's only a certain amount of your

3332
02:37:43,510 --> 02:37:47,710
agents is filled up very quickly with
metropolis areas.

3333
02:37:47,950 --> 02:37:50,400
Have you been an ambassador for UFC
Newfoundland?

3334
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:54,100
Point being.
I tried erroneously to make fun of

3335
02:37:54,101 --> 02:37:56,970
curling while I was in newfoundland
because the,

3336
02:37:56,980 --> 02:37:59,800
the,
the stage always the place we were at

3337
02:37:59,801 --> 02:38:01,780
how all these photos with people
curling.

3338
02:38:01,990 --> 02:38:05,080
So the dude with the broom and the dude
with the fucking hockey,

3339
02:38:05,081 --> 02:38:06,610
the giant steroid it out.

3340
02:38:06,630 --> 02:38:08,740
Hockey puck there.
Slide across the ground.

3341
02:38:09,100 --> 02:38:11,920
It's so good for you.
So you try to run this meaning that

3342
02:38:12,010 --> 02:38:14,260
tried joking around about it and they
will not win it.

3343
02:38:14,470 --> 02:38:16,720
Oh,
oh.

3344
02:38:17,510 --> 02:38:19,340
They loved it.
They loved their curling.

3345
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:22,820
So yeah,
I don't understand it,

3346
02:38:22,850 --> 02:38:26,680
but I guess I don't have to.
You don't have to.

3347
02:38:26,690 --> 02:38:27,960
They like it.
They like it.

3348
02:38:27,961 --> 02:38:32,961
So as Newfoundland and we should go to
the loo while you watch it for like an

3349
02:38:33,850 --> 02:38:35,450
hour.
So you kind of get compelled,

3350
02:38:35,480 --> 02:38:36,710
like who the fuck's gonna win this
thing?

3351
02:38:37,010 --> 02:38:38,120
Yeah,
stupid.

3352
02:38:38,340 --> 02:38:40,520
That's booking gigs was baseball.
Let's do it.

3353
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:42,360
Let's do Newfoundland.
Okay.

3354
02:38:42,410 --> 02:38:44,030
I'm in,
but you know you're black,

3355
02:38:44,031 --> 02:38:46,130
right?
This man.

3356
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:48,560
Just kidding.
It's Canada.

3357
02:38:50,220 --> 02:38:53,160
Are they the nicest people on the earth
or is it like Swedish people?

3358
02:38:53,161 --> 02:38:55,460
If you ever been Sweden said that they
met the nicest people.

3359
02:38:55,730 --> 02:38:59,180
I think it's like the same way
sometimes.

3360
02:38:59,360 --> 02:39:01,440
Sometimes it's southern hospitality.
It is.

3361
02:39:01,450 --> 02:39:05,030
Sometimes it's southern passive
aggressiveness and they just talk

3362
02:39:05,031 --> 02:39:06,760
horribly behind your back.
Right.

3363
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:08,090
And that's like,
um.

3364
02:39:08,930 --> 02:39:11,450
Well I was talking about this with
somebody recently that like,

3365
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:16,480
try to imagine the fact that 18,
65 when slavery was abolished was less

3366
02:39:17,751 --> 02:39:21,110
than 200 years ago.
Trying to imagine what 200 years is

3367
02:39:21,290 --> 02:39:23,400
because it's only two lifetimes.
Yeah.

3368
02:39:23,660 --> 02:39:25,760
Two people being alive from birth to
death.

3369
02:39:25,820 --> 02:39:29,300
That's 200 years.
So these people who are very healthy

3370
02:39:29,360 --> 02:39:30,890
people,
very healthy,

3371
02:39:30,891 --> 02:39:32,070
very lucky people.
I mean,

3372
02:39:32,210 --> 02:39:35,390
so they're stuck in this probably net
slaves,

3373
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:39,830
slaves.
I live in the beat conditions aren't

3374
02:39:39,831 --> 02:39:41,420
that exact,
right?

3375
02:39:41,421 --> 02:39:43,600
You don't have access to the,
to anything.

3376
02:39:43,610 --> 02:39:48,610
So it doesn't have the gluten free or to
the slave.

3377
02:39:49,700 --> 02:39:51,980
Slaves aren't getting the fresh pressed
juice soda,

3378
02:39:51,981 --> 02:39:52,600
you know,
let's,

3379
02:39:52,600 --> 02:39:57,010
let's cut it to maybe 60 slash 70.
His foot slaves.

3380
02:39:57,380 --> 02:40:01,670
Yeah.
If you're super lucky and that is only a

3381
02:40:01,671 --> 02:40:06,671
short amount of time ago and no one
understands that today.

3382
02:40:07,370 --> 02:40:08,490
There's no we,
we,

3383
02:40:08,630 --> 02:40:10,970
we can intellectualize it,
we can think about it,

3384
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,040
we can put it into our heads and try to
figure it out.

3385
02:40:13,650 --> 02:40:15,270
No one could figure that out today.
And those,

3386
02:40:15,300 --> 02:40:18,720
there's a lot of those areas of the
country that are just poisoned by those

3387
02:40:18,721 --> 02:40:21,000
old stupid ideas.
There's just stuck in there,

3388
02:40:21,001 --> 02:40:21,834
man.
Yeah.

3389
02:40:22,710 --> 02:40:25,680
In areas of the world,
there's a lot of weird areas of the

3390
02:40:25,681 --> 02:40:28,350
world that is poisoned by old stupid
ideas.

3391
02:40:29,010 --> 02:40:33,240
I um,
I think we should do newfoundland.

3392
02:40:33,390 --> 02:40:34,590
Fuck.
Yes.

3393
02:40:34,620 --> 02:40:37,500
I think we just shake off that shit.
And Joe Rogan,

3394
02:40:37,590 --> 02:40:38,630
Newfoundland,
Newfoundland.

3395
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:40,560
Good.
Let's do another one somewhere else.

3396
02:40:40,561 --> 02:40:42,270
Like Saskatchewan,
Saskatchewan.

3397
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:45,120
I used to sketch one in January when I
get crazy.

3398
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:47,910
I met A.
I met some Canadian.

3399
02:40:47,940 --> 02:40:50,040
I was in when I was in Minneapolis and
they were like,

3400
02:40:50,041 --> 02:40:51,690
you need.
I think they might've been functional.

3401
02:40:51,710 --> 02:40:54,090
Scattered while I didn't even like you
need to cut because they worked,

3402
02:40:54,100 --> 02:40:56,940
but it was some tourism fencing or
something.

3403
02:40:57,390 --> 02:41:00,300
You need to come to the Saskatchewan.
Edmonton.

3404
02:41:00,900 --> 02:41:03,210
I've done.
I think that I'm due to do an Edmonton

3405
02:41:03,211 --> 02:41:06,740
or Calgary on this tour to the river
cree and the Edmonton.

3406
02:41:06,750 --> 02:41:08,550
The casino.
That is fantastic.

3407
02:41:08,551 --> 02:41:11,190
That it's fun man.
That's how fun fucking place.

3408
02:41:11,670 --> 02:41:13,020
I like Edmonton,
man.

3409
02:41:13,110 --> 02:41:17,460
They're good people.
They're just stuck in some weird spot

3410
02:41:17,461 --> 02:41:20,230
that's like really cold for like four
months of the year.

3411
02:41:20,270 --> 02:41:21,930
But it's money,
right?

3412
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:25,570
It's money.
So you got these people?

3413
02:41:25,590 --> 02:41:27,120
No,
sometimes no.

3414
02:41:27,540 --> 02:41:31,140
They just come out of high school and
make six figures.

3415
02:41:31,190 --> 02:41:33,600
Yeah,
with their Canadian too.

3416
02:41:33,960 --> 02:41:38,430
There's something about Canadians,
like their culture does not support

3417
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:39,000
this.

3418
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:39,820
Like,
uh,

3419
02:41:39,820 --> 02:41:44,820
the world domination idea that United
States sort of has ingrained in us like

3420
02:41:44,911 --> 02:41:46,980
we're the police of the world for good
or for bad.

3421
02:41:47,010 --> 02:41:48,930
Right?
It's a lot of people think mostly bad

3422
02:41:49,470 --> 02:41:50,290
yet,
right?

3423
02:41:50,290 --> 02:41:54,840
If the Canadians don't have this,
they're not just trying to create a good

3424
02:41:54,841 --> 02:41:55,780
life for themselves.
Yeah,

3425
02:41:55,890 --> 02:41:59,130
they're just people and uh,
there's a real value in that.

3426
02:41:59,160 --> 02:42:04,050
But there's also like this idea that the
only way Canada would exist is if the

3427
02:42:04,050 --> 02:42:06,840
United States is below it.
Tacting it because this is such a

3428
02:42:06,841 --> 02:42:08,540
fucking gangster.
Yeah.

3429
02:42:08,930 --> 02:42:12,300
Right.
So that's the idea that I think makes

3430
02:42:12,301 --> 02:42:14,460
total sense if you're looking at it
objectively.

3431
02:42:14,580 --> 02:42:18,270
But goddamn it makes for some Nice folks
because Canada that they're like,

3432
02:42:18,300 --> 02:42:21,030
I think maybe my all time favorite
people anywhere.

3433
02:42:21,540 --> 02:42:26,460
I think that the nicest people,
those shows that I was drawing numbers

3434
02:42:26,610 --> 02:42:30,870
in Canada.
Good spots at 300,

3435
02:42:30,871 --> 02:42:35,871
400 seat spots easily before I was doing
it over here.

3436
02:42:36,690 --> 02:42:38,260
That makes sense.
Even Vancouver,

3437
02:42:38,350 --> 02:42:43,350
I remember doing shows in Vancouver,
2011 and Toronto played the Horseshoe in

3438
02:42:44,611 --> 02:42:49,611
2011 and then coming through first time
just with like light credits and then

3439
02:42:52,220 --> 02:42:53,670
getting it.
Holy Shit.

3440
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:56,760
Then they come in to fuck with me.
I couldn't.

3441
02:42:56,900 --> 02:43:00,790
I first started doing it.
You start hitting some splicing.

3442
02:43:00,900 --> 02:43:02,580
What the fuck?
I got people here.

3443
02:43:02,770 --> 02:43:05,850
Yeah,
and that's what Canada was when I

3444
02:43:05,970 --> 02:43:08,910
started getting offers to help.
I was thinking what is.

3445
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:11,190
It wasn't big money,
but it was just

3446
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:15,160
to have that.
It was Vancouver.

3447
02:43:15,700 --> 02:43:18,700
I forget the promoter's name,
but I played maybe there.

3448
02:43:18,770 --> 02:43:23,770
Rick Shaw,
a horseshoe tavern in Toronto if five

3449
02:43:24,431 --> 02:43:28,900
years ago and just be as shocked that it
was that many people that it was

3450
02:43:28,901 --> 02:43:29,940
psyched.
It was,

3451
02:43:29,941 --> 02:43:31,510
it was,
it was just,

3452
02:43:31,570 --> 02:43:33,800
it was.
It happened earlier over there,

3453
02:43:33,801 --> 02:43:34,040
man.

3454
02:43:34,040 --> 02:43:36,080
You know you gotta do in Toronto was me
there.

3455
02:43:36,340 --> 02:43:38,690
You've got to do the weed shop.
What's that?

3456
02:43:38,691 --> 02:43:41,060
We chopped show ever showed it,
right?

3457
02:43:41,570 --> 02:43:44,150
They have a front room where they sell
bongs,

3458
02:43:44,780 --> 02:43:47,840
rolling papers and share,
and then you go in the back room and the

3459
02:43:47,841 --> 02:43:51,740
back room doesn't have any error.
It's all just pot smoke.

3460
02:43:51,770 --> 02:43:53,540
You're breathing in pot smoke.
There's no air,

3461
02:43:53,570 --> 02:43:55,270
there's no air left.
The light,

3462
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:57,530
the candles,
candles on the table.

3463
02:43:57,680 --> 02:43:59,780
They're all running on pot smoke and
promises.

3464
02:44:00,140 --> 02:44:01,570
There's no fucking era.
That room,

3465
02:44:01,571 --> 02:44:04,580
man,
it's all just pot smoke and you get high

3466
02:44:04,581 --> 02:44:08,090
before you go onstage and then you go on
stage and it's preposterous.

3467
02:44:08,091 --> 02:44:11,010
Everybody in a goddamn coma,
it is train.

3468
02:44:11,050 --> 02:44:13,610
Just comedy show you've ever done.
Nobody wants to have.

3469
02:44:13,611 --> 02:44:15,950
For me,
this is what you need to do your regular

3470
02:44:15,951 --> 02:44:20,951
show first and then head over to that
place around 12:30 AM.

3471
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:23,060
He knew what I'm into because I do.

3472
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:29,130
I like thc capsules.
Me Too,

3473
02:44:29,880 --> 02:44:32,220
and if it's because they met them
because I get.

3474
02:44:32,310 --> 02:44:37,050
I get so weird and in my head sometimes
I can't unless I'm on,

3475
02:44:37,090 --> 02:44:39,960
unless I'm a little drunk or a little on
something else.

3476
02:44:40,530 --> 02:44:45,530
I'm not able to enjoy myself high a lot,
especially if I'm in a situation where a

3477
02:44:46,860 --> 02:44:51,840
recognizable and people recognize if I'm
high on weed and people recognize me,

3478
02:44:52,100 --> 02:44:54,280
you're worried about.
I get weird.

3479
02:44:54,281 --> 02:44:56,550
It the fuck out.
It's understandable.

3480
02:44:56,580 --> 02:44:58,250
Billows my I will.
I'm like,

3481
02:44:58,260 --> 02:44:59,580
what am I doing?
What is life?

3482
02:44:59,581 --> 02:45:01,350
What choose whatever.
What's going on?

3483
02:45:01,351 --> 02:45:03,180
What do these people,
why are they talking to me?

3484
02:45:03,181 --> 02:45:04,530
Why did I do this?
What did I do this?

3485
02:45:04,550 --> 02:45:07,410
Do I just get.
If I'm high,

3486
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:12,920
I'm gonna have.
I just can't handle it.

3487
02:45:13,230 --> 02:45:15,100
We need to hang out more.
Sure.

3488
02:45:15,370 --> 02:45:18,190
Definitely,
but it isn't a CIC capsules.

3489
02:45:18,250 --> 02:45:19,350
I'm going to hold your hand.
Figurative

3490
02:45:21,830 --> 02:45:24,330
CC capsules.
I took.

3491
02:45:25,090 --> 02:45:30,090
I went to a dispensary.
Shout out to native roots in Denver and

3492
02:45:32,330 --> 02:45:36,030
a smooth on that.
Also maybe I think I.

3493
02:45:36,180 --> 02:45:40,870
I think maybe the way I smoke,
I shouldn't be out in about smoking is

3494
02:45:40,930 --> 02:45:42,330
a.
It should be just chilling,

3495
02:45:43,050 --> 02:45:46,560
watching some shit,
playing some video games,

3496
02:45:46,740 --> 02:45:50,900
but my weed smoking never.
I just never put it.

3497
02:45:50,910 --> 02:45:55,050
If I can't create a situation with
nobody can talk to me,

3498
02:45:55,460 --> 02:45:58,680
then that's how I need to be high or the
capsules,

3499
02:45:58,710 --> 02:46:00,720
the capsules.
I can talk to me a capsule,

3500
02:46:00,721 --> 02:46:05,721
smooth me out and I started taking out
this shit is shit is great and I feel

3501
02:46:07,141 --> 02:46:10,040
good and I feel I can stand up on them.
I

3502
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:14,030
can't do smoke weed and do standup,
but I can take a capsule and behind the

3503
02:46:14,031 --> 02:46:15,500
stand.
Hm.

3504
02:46:16,630 --> 02:46:18,950
Um,
do you know the difference between

3505
02:46:19,220 --> 02:46:20,390
eating and smoking it

3506
02:46:21,910 --> 02:46:24,910
slightly,
but I'm ready for this is a chemical

3507
02:46:24,911 --> 02:46:26,380
differences,
like a smell good.

3508
02:46:26,381 --> 02:46:28,240
It's thc.
You eat it.

3509
02:46:28,270 --> 02:46:30,580
That would.
The compound of the marijuana is

3510
02:46:30,581 --> 02:46:34,510
processed by your liver produces
something called 11 hydroxy metabolite.

3511
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:36,370
Okay.
It's way more psychoactive.

3512
02:46:36,371 --> 02:46:39,580
It's like four to five times more
psychoactive than thc.

3513
02:46:39,581 --> 02:46:42,160
So you're talking about the capsules now
I'm talking about anytime you eat it,

3514
02:46:42,220 --> 02:46:44,140
eat it.
I don't like edibles.

3515
02:46:44,210 --> 02:46:45,670
If you're taking a capsule,
you're eating it.

3516
02:46:45,850 --> 02:46:47,590
You know what I'm saying?
But it doesn't,

3517
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:49,150
it doesn't matter.
It's like if it's.

3518
02:46:49,330 --> 02:46:52,960
If it goes through your digestive tract
and it's processed by your liver,

3519
02:46:52,990 --> 02:46:57,880
takes a little bit about an hour or so,
depending upon the dosage and how strong

3520
02:46:57,881 --> 02:46:59,070
it is in,
you know,

3521
02:46:59,150 --> 02:47:00,450
whether you have a full stomach or.
Yes,

3522
02:47:00,490 --> 02:47:02,620
probably probably has something to do
with it,

3523
02:47:02,950 --> 02:47:06,690
but when it's processed by your liver,
it produces this weird psychoed

3524
02:47:07,030 --> 02:47:08,620
psychedelic drug.

3525
02:47:08,800 --> 02:47:12,570
It's very different than just regular.
I don't know if it was a reason.

3526
02:47:12,580 --> 02:47:16,950
The capsules I feel wasteful the than
just swollen somebody's joint.

3527
02:47:17,050 --> 02:47:19,810
Do you know how many milligrams are in
those capsules?

3528
02:47:19,930 --> 02:47:22,600
I think is is 10.
Oh,

3529
02:47:22,601 --> 02:47:25,080
that's good.
That's a really reasonable dose and

3530
02:47:25,090 --> 02:47:29,950
that's the good news about marijuana,
like medical marijuana going nationwide

3531
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:34,180
as you can take a reasonable dose,
10 milligrams and it's therapeutic for

3532
02:47:34,181 --> 02:47:35,170
your body.
Feels good.

3533

You relax.
Nobody gets hurt.

3534
02:47:37,800 --> 02:47:39,780

3542
02:47:59,510 --> 02:48:01,370

3543
02:48:02,100 --> 02:48:05,410

Wastes like my wrist.

3544
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:07,480
Yeah.
They don't like to do stuff like an

3545
02:48:07,481 --> 02:48:10,530
explosion given people they met awful.
They just want to fuck.

3546
02:48:10,540 --> 02:48:14,050
They ain't had thought.
Maybe that's a good point.

3547
02:48:15,190 --> 02:48:16,570
Good point.
That's hard.

3548
02:48:17,080 --> 02:48:21,670

02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:29,170
Believe you said that really hurts that.
No,

3551

3552
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:35,800
Thinking about my mom right now online.
As far as somebody who's going to reach

3553
02:48:35,801 --> 02:48:40,510
out to you that now the model is not
going to reach out to you.

3554
02:48:40,870 --> 02:48:43,060
Hey,
what do you need that shit?

3555
02:48:43,090 --> 02:48:46,960
Do you need something?
Model Chick reach out and say,

3556

Hey,

3557
02:48:48,160 --> 02:48:50,920
But nobody's going to reach out like a
model check is not reaching out.

3558
02:48:50,950 --> 02:48:54,160
Hey,
I got this asshole two fingers in the

3559
02:48:54,161 --> 02:48:56,740
pussy grabbing like a fucking bowling
ball.

3560
02:48:56,780 --> 02:48:57,700
No.
Yeah.

3561
02:48:58,140 --> 02:48:58,990
They're not going to say,

3562
02:48:58,991 --> 02:49:00,790
you need this and when you,
when you,

3563
02:49:00,810 --> 02:49:02,090

3564
02:49:02,170 --> 02:49:02,820
Yeah,
they know.

3565
02:49:02,820 --> 02:49:03,131
Say,
Hey,

3566
02:49:03,131 --> 02:49:06,070

Just good point.

3567
02:49:06,730 --> 02:49:08,050
You know they used to

3568
02:49:08,490 --> 02:49:10,260
all the attention anyway,
so he's just saying,

3569
02:49:10,261 --> 02:49:12,270
oh yeah,
that's a good point.

3570
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:14,033
Yeah.
They just,

3571
02:49:14,090 --> 02:49:16,890
they want to test the waters a handle.
Burse ain't playing games ladies.

3572
02:49:17,130 --> 02:49:19,310
Okay.
Unless you're ready to go to def con

3573
02:49:19,311 --> 02:49:21,090
four.
You Ready?

3574
02:49:24,480 --> 02:49:29,480
I got high standards mean to what
I think I want kids,

3575
02:49:33,381 --> 02:49:35,930
man.
Do you know what age when you have your

3576
02:49:35,931 --> 02:49:39,400
third or fourth hotel or they don't want
kids?

3577
02:49:39,430 --> 02:49:41,810
It's three years.
Two to three years.

3578
02:49:41,930 --> 02:49:46,010
That's a good move.
I saw this pregnant woman on the l train

3579
02:49:46,700 --> 02:49:49,850
in New York,
but she was one.

3580
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:56,200
She was one of those was she didn't.
She just looked like her stomach was

3581
02:49:56,301 --> 02:49:59,090
bigger.
It nothing else affect like perfect

3582
02:49:59,091 --> 02:50:02,330
makeup.
Just dressed nice in a nice dress.

3583
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:05,150
She had to have a wedding ring.
I want it to.

3584
02:50:07,180 --> 02:50:11,080
I just wanted to ask her if everything
was okay if she was with a dude,

3585
02:50:11,990 --> 02:50:14,500
like she was so beautiful.
I kept looking at it.

3586
02:50:14,501 --> 02:50:16,750
I know she felt me looking at it.
I probably wit her out.

3587
02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:22,200
She was so beautiful.
I started picturing myself arguing with

3588
02:50:23,081 --> 02:50:24,130
the real father.

3589
02:50:24,370 --> 02:50:29,370
Five years from now,
I started pitching myself on the train,

3590
02:50:32,430 --> 02:50:33,930
holding hands or there

3591
02:50:34,450 --> 02:50:38,080
pitzer myself.
Five years from now at the yelling at

3592
02:50:38,081 --> 02:50:41,810
this dude outside the house in Jersey.
Hey Dude,

3593
02:50:41,860 --> 02:50:46,420
you had your chance.
You can use a sperm donor.

3594
02:50:46,570 --> 02:50:48,780
You're looking at her beautiful real
dot.

3595
02:50:48,910 --> 02:50:52,810
I'm the real dad.
You calculating the potential for future

3596
02:50:52,811 --> 02:50:55,390

3597
02:50:55,391 --> 02:50:57,640
structure,
you will them to take a chance and put

3598
02:50:57,641 --> 02:51:01,690
your whole life into air and just like,
oh my God,

3599
02:51:02,200 --> 02:51:05,500
look at it was you okay?
Hey Baby,

3600
02:51:05,501 --> 02:51:06,760

That's what I was saying.

3601
02:51:07,040 --> 02:51:09,100
Okay,
well we'd say I'm her here.

3602
02:51:09,101 --> 02:51:11,050
Go ahead.
If I'm looking down,

3603
02:51:11,080 --> 02:51:12,460
I'm just shaking my head.
I'm just like,

3604
02:51:12,580 --> 02:51:14,140
every now and then I just go like this
with my hands.

3605
02:51:14,510 --> 02:51:16,750
You want to try it?
Come on the train.

3606
02:51:17,380 --> 02:51:18,390

3610
02:51:27,161 --> 02:51:30,460

was,

3611
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:32,590
something crazy happened.
Whoa dude.

3612
02:51:32,591 --> 02:51:34,780
I'm not asking for real life.
This isn't law and order.

3613
02:51:34,810 --> 02:51:36,010
