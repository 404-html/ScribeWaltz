1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:06,703
Okay.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,110
The Joe Rogan experience

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,680
and we're live.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,020
You don't have to wear headphones
if you don't want your Paul Stanley.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,173
That's right.

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,010
That's right.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,060
What do you want to take a
shit on the floor over there?

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,110
You feel free.

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,321
Hey,

10
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:27,681
you know,

11
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:29,750
use your age if that's what turns you on.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,460
But I would accept it.

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,990
I wouldn't even take photos of it.

14
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,980
I wouldn't even tell anybody.

15
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,230
I'm just putting Joe Rogan podcast.

16
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,400
You put it down on Twitter?

17
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,220
Yeah.

18
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:38,570
Okay.

19
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,050
He did it.

20
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:39,883
Beautiful.

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,210
All right,

22
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,030
we're live.

23
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,420
Good.

24
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,170
First of all,

25
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,480
I just want to say thank you
very much for being here at this.

26
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,680
When I was a little kid,

27
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,270
like I,

28
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,340
I've been a fan of kiss since.

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,960
I can't remember when I wasn't like I
was a tiny little kid when I first found

30
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:54,794
out about kiss.

31
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,320
So to have you here in my podcast,

32
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:01,760
I've been to many of your shows
both pre when you wore makeup.

33
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,030
Then when you got off of makeup and
then when he got back on makeup again.

34
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,250
So I've been through the full spectrum,

35
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,300
so low.

36
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,440
I had the solo albums.

37
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:10,274
I was there too.

38
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,920
You were there for the whole
thing through the whole thing.

39
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,360
Every show you were at.

40
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:14,991
I was at,

41
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:15,950
that's what I hear.

42
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,450
But that is a weird thing though,

43
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:19,190
that you like you guys,

44
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:19,640
um,

45
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,570
you broke up,

46
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,070
we're not broke up,

47
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:27,071
but you got rid of Chris and you got rid
of ace and then you brought in new guys

48
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,080
and now you kind of have
guys that play those roles.

49
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:31,040
Is that how you're doing it now?

50
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,841
I don't know that you,

51
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,420
you could,

52
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,253
I mean,

53
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,480
that's a tough one to answer.

54
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,343
You know,

55
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,040
I think where we went
astray is when we started,

56
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,740
when we first replaced Peter and we
decided we needed a new character.

57
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,640
And the problem with that kind of
stuff is that it started to become

58
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,051
interestingly,

59
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:51,860
I think,

60
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,850
disingenuous.

61
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:52,971
It,

62
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:53,201
it,

63
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:53,720
it,

64
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,840
it took on an air of
fake in the sense that,

65
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:57,674
um,

66
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,790
it became a menagerie.

67
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,121
I mean,

68
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:04,040
we had a fox and a Egyptian warrior
next week would have turtle boy and the

69
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:04,874
frog,

70
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,780
the frog man.

71
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,900
So I think once we,

72
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:11,000
we brought a son Peter
back for the reunion tour,

73
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,381
which,

74
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:12,950
um,

75
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,420
I hoped we'd go on forever.

76
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:15,171
And in other words,

77
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:17,660
I hope that everybody
would get back together.

78
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,773
Um,

79
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,450
everybody would see the,

80
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:20,960
the,

81
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,470
the uh,

82
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,550
error in their ways and we would move
forward and stay together forever.

83
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,020
But when that wasn't to be,

84
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:27,411
I thought,

85
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:28,040
you know,

86
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,040
we really built these four images and
arguably you can go anywhere in the world

87
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:38,420
and people know who kisses regardless of
whether they know who those people are.

88
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,970
So to to give up that,

89
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,090
because we found that those guys were no
longer either capable or wanted to give

90
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:51,050
it 100% well who loses out the fans.

91
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:51,980
So no,

92
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,640
we,

93
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:52,941
you know,

94
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:57,320
those images are the images that will
continue when I'm not hearing either.

95
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,401
Yeah.

96
00:02:58,401 --> 00:02:59,980
That's gotta be

97
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,980
a strange place to be where you and Jean
are bolt these super focused healthy

98
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,890
non drug using guys.

99
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:12,760
And then you have these two guys in
your band that are integral parts of the

100
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:13,480
band.

101
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,781
You know,

102
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:14,110
I mean,

103
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,550
Beth was a huge hit.

104
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,300
It was,

105
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,620
and look,

106
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,161
this,

107
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:21,970
this whole show could turn into
denigrating the former members,

108
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:23,740
but I don't want to do that.

109
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:24,940
But honestly,

110
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,023
um,

111
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,040
that song was the product of a great
producer who had a big hand in writing it

112
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:38,551
and a co writer who Peter used on a
lot of things that he supposedly wrote.

113
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,600
So,

114
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,230
um,

115
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,290
but they were integral
members of the band and,

116
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,124
uh,

117
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,470
it's very difficult to,

118
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,090
to move forward when two
of the people are like,

119
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,340
at times like flat tires,

120
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:54,941
you're trying to,

121
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:56,440
you're trying to move forward.

122
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,623
Um,

123
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,720
it becomes more of a problem when they're,

124
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,003
um,

125
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,840
re reason,

126
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,840
reason for being is to foil and,

127
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:09,674
and to,

128
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,210
um,

129
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,070
throw off track what you're trying to do.

130
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,250
So at some point it really became more
about trying to disrupt what we were

131
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:23,710
trying to do with no regard to whether
or not what they want to do was right or

132
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:24,011
wrong.

133
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:24,844
They just wanted,

134
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,500
let's screwed gene and Paul.

135
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,610
So we'll say no,

136
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:28,540
and they'll say yes.

137
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,160
So it really became very,

138
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:30,610
very,

139
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,720
very difficult.

140
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,220
So do you think they did that?

141
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,323
Because,

142
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,740
I mean,

143
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,150
did they have a logical reason?

144
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,910
Was it just because they were
self sabotaging the anyway,

145
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,860
I think self sabotaging comes into
it because I think that's been a,

146
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,260
something that's run through
parts of their lives.

147
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:48,310
But I also think that there was,

148
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,120
um,

149
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,510
a lot of resentment and honestly,

150
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,100
I don't believe in resenting people
for what they can do that you can't,

151
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,890
if you're lucky enough to have
people around you who can do what,

152
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:02,740
you can't make them your best friend.

153
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,480
You know?

154
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,740
I mean,

155
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,210
I learn from Oren and um,

156
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,230
everybody can't be,

157
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,011
you know,

158
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:11,920
everybody can't be the
best at what they do,

159
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,550
but you can benefit from
being around those people.

160
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:16,540
So look,

161
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:16,871
I,

162
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:17,530
I,

163
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,530
I never wanted or expected anybody in the
band to do necessarily the same amount

164
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:24,850
of work that I did,

165
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,190
but I expected them to give 100%.

166
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,383
Everybody's,

167
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,313
you know,

168
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,170
I was all for splitting things evenly,

169
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,191
uh,

170
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:36,220
in the original lineup
of the band up until,

171
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:36,760
uh,

172
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,593
you know,

173
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,460
those guys departed the first time.

174
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,241
But,

175
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,074
um,

176
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,850
you have to give your best,

177
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,810
when you say like resent,

178
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,060
like resent for what you,

179
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,170
what they can't do.

180
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,340
But they were a great,

181
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:51,581
I mean,

182
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:51,851
Peter,

183
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,440
Chris was a fantastic drummer.

184
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,600
Ace freely was a great guitarist.

185
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:55,891
Who,

186
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:58,700
what would they resent
other than your sobriety

187
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,690
or your health?

188
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,170
I think focus and drive and determination.

189
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:03,830
Yeah.

190
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,910
Determination and seeing
the whole picture and,

191
00:06:06,911 --> 00:06:11,911
and I'm wanting this to be as good as it
could be as opposed to falling back on

192
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:14,240
all,

193
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,073
you know,

194
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,430
it's rock and roll.

195
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:16,671
Well,

196
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:18,950
rock and roll is no excuse for mediocrity.

197
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,860
And rock and roll is no
excuse for not doing your job.

198
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,671
You know,

199
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:23,451
if somebody says,

200
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:23,631
Oh,

201
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,100
my playing is rock and roll.

202
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,431
No,

203
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:26,480
that's just bad.

204
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,280
You know,

205
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,921
it's bad.

206
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,150
And then there's rock and roll.

207
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,403
So,

208
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,603
um,

209
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,021
you know,

210
00:06:32,021 --> 00:06:32,240
he,

211
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,481
look,

212
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:37,481
it's a long time ago and it's kind of
like talking about a girlfriend or a wife

213
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:40,430
you had a long time ago and trying to,

214
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:42,440
to disseminate what went wrong.

215
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:44,450
And at some point it
really doesn't matter.

216
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,171
Yeah.

217
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:45,501
It's,

218
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,710
it's always hard to deal with people
that are in that sort of self sabic

219
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,210
sabotaging mode.

220
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,020
And you see it all the time.

221
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:56,060
And one of the things that I always
equate to is when you see people smoking

222
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:58,430
cigarettes and they throw
their cigarette on the ground,

223
00:06:58,431 --> 00:06:59,810
and I'll think anything of it.

224
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,640
And it's,

225
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,780
it's a super common thing.

226
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:06,080
It's very rare that you see people just
throw trash on the ground in front of

227
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:06,890
everybody.

228
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,460
But people will throw cigarettes on the
ground in front of anybody and they're

229
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:13,280
not there because they're
sabotaging their own body.

230
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,700
They don't mind just throwing
stuff on the ground too.

231
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:20,780
It's sort of the same kind
of a mentality I think.

232
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:21,080
So,

233
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,470
you know,

234
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,710
and perhaps if it's okay for me to smoke,

235
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,590
it's okay for me to discard my cigarette.

236
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,690
You're going to breed
the smoke second hand.

237
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:30,620
So here's a,

238
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:31,330
but you know,

239
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:31,920
so,

240
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,753
um,

241
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,090
I don't,

242
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,010
I really don't know.

243
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:39,011
I don't know them mentality that wants
to sabotage what ultimately benefits you.

244
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,340
Um,

245
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:43,820
look,

246
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,680
if you're in a band that's doing great
and you're not the primary songwriter

247
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,330
where the primary singer,

248
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,380
well you should revel in what you have.

249
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,243
Um,

250
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,333
um,

251
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,470
you know,

252
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,450
the idea of equality,

253
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,690
some have to be more equal than others,

254
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,310
you know,

255
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:03,800
um,

256
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,180
everybody can be in the car together,

257
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:06,260
somebody's got to drive,

258
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:06,981
we all,

259
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:08,420
we're all going the same direction.

260
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,111
But,

261
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:09,830
um,

262
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,180
you know,

263
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,050
when people reach a point of saying,

264
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:12,291
well,

265
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:17,291
I want an equal amount of songs while do
we leave off strider so we can put your

266
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:17,961
song on?

267
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:19,790
Or did we leave off Detroit rock city?

268
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,050
It doesn't work like that.

269
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,040
Um,

270
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,150
there's no,

271
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,450
I don't believe that
there's any birthright or,

272
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,620
or that,

273
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,800
that we should expect a quota in anything.

274
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:33,241
We,

275
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:36,140
we get what we deserve and,

276
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:36,470
uh,

277
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,150
somebody has to decide that.

278
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,410
So is that the most difficult thing about
being in a band is just managing all

279
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:43,820
the egos and managing,

280
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,151
you know,

281
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:46,280
everybody has their own
point of view where they're,

282
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,260
they're not getting appreciated or looked
at with the proper respect and that,

283
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:51,531
that,

284
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,470
that's often the situation in band.

285
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:56,190
And thankfully not the situation

286
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,023
in our band.

287
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,750
Um,

288
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,390
Eric's been in out of
the band for 20 years,

289
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:01,290
I think at this point.

290
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,361
And Tom,

291
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:04,590
he's been around the band
and been in the band.

292
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,743
Um,

293
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,560
I think over 10 at this point,

294
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,100
the key to a great band or any great
situation is doing what's best for the

295
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:14,430
situation,

296
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,350
not what's best for you.

297
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,480
I don't have to be right.

298
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,850
I just want to see the right thing happen.

299
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,350
So if you're more tied up in,

300
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:27,270
in the ego gratification
or in the control factor,

301
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,610
I honestly don't need to,

302
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,930
to control anything.

303
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,150
But I do have a point of view and
I guess I've earned my place at,

304
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,660
at this juncture.

305
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:38,760
But everybody gets a chance to,

306
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,623
to,

307
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,201
you know,

308
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:44,490
state their views and hopefully they're
always with the best intentions.

309
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,830
And I think that's what
the way the band works now,

310
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,083
um,

311
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,610
we have a drum or doesn't
like to take a solo and this,

312
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:54,840
this guy could play a better solar with
one hand and most drummers could play

313
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:56,220
with every limb of their body.

314
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,050
So everybody really,

315
00:09:58,051 --> 00:09:58,884
um,

316
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,941
it's all for one.

317
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:00,774
And one for all.

318
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,430
You guys were one of the first bands
that got really big doing live shows like

319
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:13,570
your live shows were so spectacular
that when you put a live album out,

320
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:18,550
when you put out kiss alive and then
kiss alive to those albums were so big.

321
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,170
Like,

322
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:19,660
uh,

323
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,081
I mean,

324
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:22,240
and it's obviously we're
dating ourselves here,

325
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:27,241
but just the albums when you'd open up
kiss alive to that big silver dynamic

326
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,743
record.

327
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,500
I mean it was,

328
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,500
it was awesome and the performances were
so intense and it was so much fun to

329
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:38,140
listen to that it really
boosted you guys up.

330
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,280
And when I was a kid,

331
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,660
it would really drive me fucking crazy
that I didn't hear your songs enough on

332
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:45,940
the radio and what I did
here when your songs,

333
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:47,140
I got super excited.

334
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,250
I got pumped.

335
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,490
But it was always like
Detroit rock city or Beth.

336
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,820
It was never like cold gin or,

337
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,410
or one of the more obscure titles,

338
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,220
you know,

339
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,060
which cold gin.

340
00:10:58,061 --> 00:10:58,930
Not a very obscure song.

341
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:00,190
But it was,

342
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,360
you guys became big almost in spite.

343
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,880
Yeah,

344
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,551
I have business.

345
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:06,140
Yeah.

346
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,780
And I think to this day,

347
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:12,590
we still retain a certain amount of being.

348
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,360
The black sheep were still,

349
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:14,961
look,

350
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:18,200
it took 14 years for us to get into
the rock and roll hall of fame.

351
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,920
Not that,

352
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,431
you know,

353
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:21,590
necessarily I lost any sleep over it,

354
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,221
but,

355
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,030
um,

356
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,030
validation from critics and people like
that has been something that's been,

357
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,421
you know,

358
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:31,040
I'm a long time coming,

359
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:36,041
but it's never been an issue because
our success was based upon people,

360
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,220
you know,

361
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,150
real fans,

362
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:39,560
the people who buy tickets,

363
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,470
buy albums and stand by you.

364
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,310
Um,

365
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,170
so certainly credibility and,

366
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:46,760
and,

367
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,170
and the stuff that,

368
00:11:48,171 --> 00:11:49,004
um,

369
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,180
uh,

370
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,400
the media would like to,

371
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,200
to,

372
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,900
um,

373
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,220
dictate is nothing

374
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,990
that we've ever been a part of.

375
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,180
Didn't bother you at all
when you guys weren't,

376
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,670
was it something that
you came to get over,

377
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:00,911
but it,

378
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:04,060
did it bother you at all that you guys
weren't getting the record play that or

379
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:05,770
their radio play rather than
you should have deserved?

380
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,850
I was shocked in the beginning that
some of the critics who made us their

381
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:13,150
darlings when we were,

382
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,510
uh,

383
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:13,631
uh,

384
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,820
nobody band in New York City,

385
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,980
once we became successful,

386
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,040
even in the earliest days,

387
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,053
we sold out.

388
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:22,841
Well,

389
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:24,100
what do you mean we sold out?

390
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,963
You know,

391
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,270
you think I wanted to just be your band.

392
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,541
You know,

393
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,580
this one guy with his typewriter.

394
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,241
So,

395
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:32,074
um,

396
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:32,710
you know,

397
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,780
we did this to succeed and,

398
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,763
um,

399
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,161
to,

400
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:39,220
to be slighted for success.

401
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,410
I never got it.

402
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:42,040
You know,

403
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,080
bands like television or,

404
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,891
you know,

405
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:49,150
a lot of the bands that came out of
New York that went nowhere went nowhere

406
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,170
because they sucked.

407
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:50,890
You know,

408
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,240
the critics may have liked him,

409
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,190
but they were,

410
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,750
they were irrelevant today.

411
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,550
And in the scheme of things,

412
00:12:57,551 --> 00:12:58,301
even back then,

413
00:12:58,301 --> 00:12:59,260
they were irrelevant.

414
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,100
It's nice to know that there were a
hipster's even back then when it came to

415
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:04,900
like liking things that are obscure,

416
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,680
that's always been out.

417
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,790
That's a weird draw,

418
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,450
isn't it?

419
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:07,631
Well,

420
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:08,464
you know,

421
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,950
it's not unusual in,

422
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:15,430
in certain circles that certain people
want to outdo each other by knowing

423
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:16,690
something more obscure than that.

424
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,440
Oh yeah,

425
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,490
you like that band.

426
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,761
Well,

427
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:19,900
I know a band that he's in,

428
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,730
he hasn't even sold an album,

429
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,900
you know,

430
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,320
I know abandoned has no
strings on their guitars,

431
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,071
you know,

432
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:27,821
so it,

433
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:29,080
it becomes absurd.

434
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,310
It becomes absurd.

435
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,150
Um,

436
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,620
we've been doing this 40 years,

437
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:37,030
we just did 42 shows in
America to 600,000 people.

438
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,193
So,

439
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,163
um,

440
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,730
the public speaks loudly
and they ultimately,

441
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,361
you know,

442
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:45,940
dictate what is and what isn't.

443
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,871
That is a,

444
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:48,400
it's a very obscure,

445
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,030
a very strange instinct to,

446
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:55,810
to want to find obscure things or more
obscure things that other people somehow

447
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:57,670
that validates your,

448
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,271
you know,

449
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:58,561
your,

450
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:00,030
your um,

451
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,810
street cred.

452
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,051
Yeah.

453
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:02,291
Your,

454
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:02,531
your,

455
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:04,550
your credibility that somehow you,

456
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:04,860
you,

457
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,201
you know,

458
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:06,640
something less,

459
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,870
less popular,

460
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,853
less popular.

461
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,390
What's the point?

462
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:11,260
Well,

463
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:11,660
your,

464
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,550
your music,

465
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,001
that's what's,

466
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:15,520
what's crazy is the music
just kept getting better.

467
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,500
And so for anybody saying that
you sold out when the music was,

468
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,560
it was always great but
it kept getting better.

469
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:22,900
It wasn't like that happens with bands.

470
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:25,630
Like some bands only have
a few albums in them.

471
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,430
And then for whatever reason,

472
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:30,640
whether it's the ego divide
between the band members or,

473
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,991
I mean,

474
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:31,171
what,

475
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,800
what is it you think I love,

476
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,060
I love what I do.

477
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,370
I love what I do.

478
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,380
I wake up every day and go,

479
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,540
this is another blessed day,

480
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,231
you know?

481
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:42,040
And,

482
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,610
um,

483
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,050
that keeps it all fresh.

484
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,800
Um,

485
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,240
I love music.

486
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:47,500
I love rock and roll.

487
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,120
I Love R and B.

488
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:49,421
To me,

489
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,650
there's two kinds of music,

490
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:51,484
good and bad.

491
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,743
Um,

492
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,770
there's so much great music.

493
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:55,910
There's so much great art.

494
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,960
There's family,

495
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:58,030
there's so much you know,

496
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,430
to do in your life that,

497
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,264
um,

498
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,490
I love it.

499
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,520
And I don't see any reason to stop,

500
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,193
you know,

501
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,030
I don't see any reason to get old or
stop or I'm having a grand old time.

502
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:11,661
Well,

503
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,680
we all get old.

504
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,820
There's no way to avoid that,

505
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:14,450
right?

506
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:14,751
Yeah.

507
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:15,170
But you,

508
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,441
you,

509
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,340
you can do it.

510
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,830
You can,

511
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:19,664
uh,

512
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,410
you can do it gracefully,

513
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,371
gracefully.

514
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:23,360
But again,

515
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:26,720
that's up to somebody's
perception of what gracefully is.

516
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,350
You know,

517
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,711
I,

518
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:28,520
uh,

519
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,990
I have no desire to,

520
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,460
to really get old,

521
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,301
you know.

522
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:33,134
Um,

523
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,730
um,

524
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,150
you know,

525
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,640
did I ever think I'd
look like this at my age?

526
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:37,941
No,

527
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:39,200
but it's cool.

528
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:39,890
It's good.

529
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,130
You know?

530
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,760
How old are you now?

531
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,593
62.

532
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,463
You look great.

533
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,270
If I look like you had 62,

534
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:45,440
I'll be happy as fuck.

535
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,640
I'm pretty happy.

536
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,321
I'm happy.

537
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:48,470
I've,

538
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,920
uh,

539
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,161
you know,

540
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:50,630
my wife is spectacular.

541
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:52,100
I've got four great kids.

542
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,263
Um,

543
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,951
life is great.

544
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:55,731
I make music.

545
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:57,140
I do the same thing now.

546
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,580
I did in junior high school,

547
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,440
I played the guitar in a rock band.

548
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,450
That's what I do.

549
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,310
I know 62 is like,

550
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:05,390
people think about like,

551
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,901
Oh,

552
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:07,760
you're in your retirement years now.

553
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:11,900
You're not fucking rocking in front of
20,000 people screaming their heads off.

554
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,230
Yeah.

555
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,771
It's,

556
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,604
uh,

557
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,270
it's great.

558
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,730
It's certainly not what
I thought it would be.

559
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,923
Um,

560
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,620
and that's,

561
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,350
that's part of the beauty
is a lot of times your,

562
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:25,100
your perception of what something will
be like in your life turns out to be

563
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:26,660
completely false.

564
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,390
What,

565
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,430
what we expect aging to be or what
we expect certain people to be like.

566
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,290
It's all based on preconceived
notions that have no basis in reality.

567
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,101
Yeah.

568
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:42,101
And this is the first generation really
that seeing rockstars deep into their

569
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,780
sixties just killing it.

570
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,411
You know,

571
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:45,950
I mean,

572
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,760
we sought of rock and roll as
being a young person's game.

573
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:49,911
Well,

574
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:50,511
it was,

575
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:55,511
it was and with good reason when rock
and roll for started with the exception

576
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:56,431
of,

577
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:58,880
of certain artists,

578
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,750
it really was a,

579
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,603
um,

580
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,880
it was a factory for record
companies to create talent.

581
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,920
When you got tired of Fabian,

582
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:11,180
they gave you Frankie Avalon.

583
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:12,710
When you got tired of Frankie Avalon,

584
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:13,544
they gave you,

585
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,210
um,

586
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,043
Jimmy Clanton.

587
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:20,170
They had all these teen idols and they
just spoonfed you and spoon fed them

588
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:21,134
songs.

589
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,540
Once you got tired of them,

590
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,980
there was somebody else who came along.

591
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,770
Once band started writing
their own material,

592
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,090
they got the chance to
reflect their point of view.

593
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,610
And as long as it reflected
the fan's point of view,

594
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,810
they could get older.

595
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,380
Rock and roll now has become much
more like the blues because um,

596
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,060
you're constantly writing about your
life and as long as people can relate to

597
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:44,510
it,

598
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:44,991
you know,

599
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:46,340
the day I start writing about,

600
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,533
um,

601
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:47,960
you know,

602
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,010
the Butler didn't show
today or something like

603
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,550
that,

604
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,360
then you're fucked,

605
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,750
you know.

606
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,990
Yeah.

607
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,920
I saw Tim Allen go on stage once and he
was talking about his Ferrari breaking

608
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:58,350
down and hung my head.

609
00:17:58,351 --> 00:17:58,590
Yeah,

610
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,910
I'm sure the whole audience is going.

611
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:00,121
Yeah,

612
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:00,600
we,

613
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,920
we got one of those too.

614
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,361
Yeah,

615
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:03,990
he uh,

616
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,920
I guess they forced him to not do standup.

617
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,270
I was doing home improvement
cause he had sort of a risk,

618
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:10,590
a act and it was like a
very family friendly show.

619
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,880
And then when he stopped doing it,

620
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,740
he came back and when he came back,

621
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:13,891
you know,

622
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:17,040
he's got his perspective
is just so skewed.

623
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,550
He's this multimillionaire,

624
00:18:18,551 --> 00:18:20,640
a hugely famous guy and you know,

625
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,300
what does he,

626
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,230
what is he going to write about?

627
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:23,550
He writes about his fucking Ferrari.

628
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:24,020
Break it down.

629
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,990
But you don't have to.

630
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,700
No you don't.

631
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:25,850
No,

632
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:26,683
I really don't.

633
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,990
I never became famous to cut myself
off from the people who made me famous.

634
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,730
I never,

635
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,360
it was,

636
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,860
it was an escape for me.

637
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,150
I wanted to,

638
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,160
as an escape from a nine to five job,

639
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,610
but I never did it because I
wanted to get away from life.

640
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,773
You know,

641
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,231
you know,

642
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:44,670
if you go to the supermarket,

643
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,990
I'm there pushing a cart.

644
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:46,621
You know,

645
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:48,240
if you go to my kid's school,

646
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:48,661
I'm,

647
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,530
they're dropping them off.

648
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,960
You don't have a bunch of
dudes earpieces circling you,

649
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,100
scanning the aisles,

650
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,343
the cereal aisle,

651
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:00,230
if stuff is so pathetic and it's born
out of a bunch of spineless artists who

652
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:09,270
need to be propped up by people around
them who make them feel important.

653
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,050
The only reason you need all those body
guards around you is because you got a

654
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,250
lot of bodyguards around you.

655
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,750
If you just went about your business,

656
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,160
we would give a shit.

657
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,020
But what if he like Justin Bieber
or what do you think about that?

658
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,920
What about it faster,

659
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,373
you know?

660
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,520
Um,

661
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:23,701
I mean,

662
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:24,540
he's essentially,

663
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,540
what you were talking about before
with are the people that the studio is

664
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,260
create.

665
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,520
They write the songs farm,

666
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:30,331
they put these artists,

667
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:31,051
they prop them up,

668
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:32,010
they put them into position.

669
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,180
But now here he is,

670
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:38,490
this 20 year old boy trying to
manage essentially unmanageable fame.

671
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,211
Yeah.

672
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,150
But it starts with your family
and it starts with your parents.

673
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,523
And um,

674
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,910
if your parents aren't there to give
you a foundation and to be there to tell

675
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:49,920
you when you're going off the rails,

676
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,630
then you were in a lot of trouble.

677
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,770
So I really,

678
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:53,430
uh,

679
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,200
when I see a kid in trouble,

680
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,370
I look at the parents.

681
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,051
Yeah.

682
00:19:58,051 --> 00:19:59,010
Well that's good point.

683
00:19:59,011 --> 00:19:59,844
I've met his dad,

684
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,170
let's see.

685
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,390
It seems like a nice fellow but also
seems like it could be one of my friends.

686
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:05,970
Um,

687
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,460
when you see a young guy like that,

688
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:13,490
like a young 20 year old guy who's just
ridiculously famous and you think about

689
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,750
your life and your career,

690
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,420
you guys did it in a very unusual way.

691
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,020
And one of the things that was very
unusual is that you have wore makeup and

692
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,790
that was a such a slick move.

693
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,090
Cause you guys were famous as shit
and no one knew what you looked like.

694
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,680
And that's a double edged sword too
because on one hand I kind of craved the

695
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:34,050
recognition that that guy,

696
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:35,370
the star child was getting,

697
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:36,300
but I wasn't getting,

698
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,980
when you can go to a newsstand and every
magazine has your photo on the cover

699
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,320
and you're standing there
and nobody knows who you are,

700
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,340
they just going,

701
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,830
who's the tall guy with the,

702
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,010
the high heels on?

703
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,131
So,

704
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:48,964
um,

705
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:49,811
it was,

706
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:50,644
uh,

707
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,410
but you know it all,

708
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:54,010
all the time.

709
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,480
It's always going to come down to,

710
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,381
at the end of the day,

711
00:20:56,381 --> 00:21:01,381
you gotta face yourself and do you like
who you are and are you a good person in

712
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:04,210
or you're living a good life and,

713
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:04,670
uh,

714
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,710
where are you falling prey to?

715
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:10,711
Like having salaried friends
around you and will see a posse,

716
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:12,970
you know,

717
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,780
all,

718
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,613
you know,

719
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:15,970
I didn't want to posse.

720
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:16,890
I wanted a pussy.

721
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:18,820
Now,

722
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,541
did you ever,

723
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,940
during this time where you're
sort of craving recognition,

724
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:25,300
where you guys who are
massively successful on the
cover of all these magazines,

725
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,170
did you ever want to just put the star
child outfit on and just walk around with

726
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:30,220
no makeup on and go,

727
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:31,054
Hey,

728
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,650
look at this magazine?

729
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,270
Hmm,

730
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,290
who's this guy looked like it was,

731
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:35,780
uh,

732
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,080
you know,

733
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,360
it was difficult at times to like want
to be in the audience at these award

734
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:40,781
shows.

735
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:41,081
I mean,

736
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:42,470
I was like everybody else,

737
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,343
you want to,

738
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,213
um,

739
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,133
um,

740
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:45,430
you know,

741
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,290
Hobnob with all these people and,

742
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:52,120
and we didn't go out or be seen publicly,

743
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:52,441
you know,

744
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:53,200
without the makeup.

745
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,981
So it was,

746
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,180
it was an interesting,

747
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,550
it was an interesting dichotomy.

748
00:21:57,551 --> 00:21:58,384
We can say,

749
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:58,661
well,

750
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,730
the very few people have
ever had that moment.

751
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,151
I mean,

752
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:01,990
I don't think anybody could,

753
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,900
like someone could show
Justin Bieber like you could,

754
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:08,770
you could bring him to someone else
who had been famous very young and they

755
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:10,270
could perhaps give him some advice,

756
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,060
but nobody could really
give you guys advice.

757
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:17,800
There was nobody that was a gigantic
international superstar who is essentially

758
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,490
unrecognizable without makeup
on Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne.

759
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:22,160
They could,

760
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,840
oh,

761
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,030
that's a fucking ridiculous trick.

762
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,870
Clark Kent with his fucking glasses that
great and in a heartbeat isn't a isn't

763
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:29,261
it great?

764
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:29,391
You,

765
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:29,950
you know,

766
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,300
you take off the glasses and it's like,

767
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,430
I don't know who this guy is,

768
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,730
you know?

769
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:34,940
Yeah.

770
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,711
It was ridiculous.

771
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:35,891
I mean,

772
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:37,300
even Bruce Wayne,

773
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:37,691
I mean,

774
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:38,110
I'll,

775
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,430
you could see the bottom of his face.

776
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,960
You got to know who the fuck that guy is.

777
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,620
Pay His friends are
going to go do you your,

778
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:44,310
your mouth looks a lot
like Batman's house.

779
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,610
That's the beauty of,

780
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,210
you know,

781
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,590
fantasy and comic books.

782
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,430
Yes.

783
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,670
The beauty of fantasy and conquest,

784
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,610
but we just kind of merge those worlds.

785
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,030
Yeah.

786
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,361
And,

787
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:52,720
uh,

788
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,171
you know,

789
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:53,401
we,

790
00:22:53,401 --> 00:22:57,010
we really have created these
iconic figures in these,

791
00:22:57,011 --> 00:23:02,011
these personalities that exist with
us and without us and will continue to

792
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:04,594
exist,

793
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,910
whether it's comic books or,

794
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,350
um,

795
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:08,680
you know,

796
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,790
merchandise,

797
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,624
um,

798
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,060
movies at some point.

799
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:14,000
All kinds of things.

800
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:14,760
So it's,

801
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,790
it's really interesting.

802
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:15,961
We,

803
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:20,961
we created alter egos that are ultimately
much bigger than we are and much more

804
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:23,410
timeless than we are.

805
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,540
You're your movie that you guys made,

806
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:25,701
we,

807
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:29,290
you were essentially superheroes in a
movie with a Phantom of the paradise I

808
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,140
would is called and no,

809
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:30,850
that was that.

810
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,330
No,

811
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,170
Phantom of the paradise.

812
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:32,651
What was that?

813
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:33,520
That was Paul William,

814
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:33,730
right?

815
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,541
That was the movie.

816
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,830
I don't know if that was any better.

817
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,150
What was,

818
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:37,900
what was the,

819
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,840
like the Phantom or kiss me.

820
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:40,750
It's the fandom of the park.

821
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,670
If I still have no idea what that film,

822
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,541
the end of the film,

823
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,650
I have no idea what it was about.

824
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,363
Um,

825
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:46,881
that was,

826
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:47,270
uh,

827
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,620
a real debacle,

828
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:49,550
a real disaster.

829
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:49,820
We,

830
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,151
we,

831
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:50,984
um,

832
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,750
there've been some
pitfalls a along the way.

833
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:53,961
And,

834
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:54,680
and uh,

835
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,210
at some point our manager said,

836
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:56,451
you know,

837
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:57,710
we should do a film.

838
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:58,610
And I was like,

839
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,240
okay.

840
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,320
Nobody ever said to us,

841
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:01,520
you don't know how to act.

842
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,310
You,

843
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,710
you know,

844
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:02,991
you,

845
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:06,230
you should take some acting lessons
and you might want to read the script.

846
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,381
So,

847
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:08,150
um,

848
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,830
as soon as we started work on it,

849
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:10,700
I remember just going,

850
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:11,534
this sucks.

851
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,610
This is really bad.

852
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,480
And uh,

853
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:14,841
they would go,

854
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:14,991
no,

855
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:15,141
no,

856
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:15,291
no,

857
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,690
this is like a hard day's
night meets star wars.

858
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:19,370
And I bought it,

859
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,241
I bought it.

860
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:22,190
And I remember going over to bill a coin,

861
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:25,300
our manager after one of the tanks
and going to this really is horrible.

862
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:25,750
It's going,

863
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:25,880
no,

864
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,720
it's going to be great.

865
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,160
Well it's socked.

866
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,660
I mean a movie for TV,

867
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:30,020
right?

868
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,501
Yes.

869
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:35,501
But it actually played
internationally in theaters and um,

870
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,690
if you think the effects were
bad on a television screen,

871
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,190
you should see them blown up.

872
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:41,024
I mean,

873
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,560
I had to go to a screening of it,

874
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,453
um,

875
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,680
before it was shown on NBC and it
was on a big screen at the screen,

876
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,030
a screen actors guild and you know,

877
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,320
we're all going to concentrate in this
box goes up in the air and you see the

878
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:55,610
wires pulling it up,

879
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:56,870
you know.

880
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,590
But look,

881
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,280
you know,

882
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,170
this has been a great journey.

883
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,651
This is,

884
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:03,470
this is that nobody could,

885
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:04,580
could make this stuff up.

886
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,091
No,

887
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:06,140
nobody couldn't make this stuff up.

888
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:06,830
But the,

889
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,311
the,

890
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:10,490
the path that you guys took really was
a path that nobody had taken before.

891
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:10,671
I mean,

892
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:11,810
you guys would go out in public,

893
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,210
he would wear like bandit masks and stuff.

894
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:15,800
You'd have like Bandanas on your face.

895
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,680
People were trying desperately
to take your photos different,

896
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,610
different time.

897
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,513
Um,

898
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,160
now you have,

899
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,530
you know,

900
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:26,420
Paparazzi are a breed at this
point where as back then,

901
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,673
um,

902
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,390
literally you could have somebody take
your photo and we would have guys run

903
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:33,350
over and pull the film.

904
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,000
You can't do that kind of stuff now.

905
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:35,780
It was,

906
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,291
it was,

907
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,124
um,

908
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,750
uncharted territory,

909
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:39,620
I guess at that point.

910
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,540
So now everyone's got a
camera on their phone.

911
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,860
It's way more bizarre.

912
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,071
Yeah.

913
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:43,431
Yeah.

914
00:25:43,431 --> 00:25:44,240
I mean,

915
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,630
you know,

916
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,560
you have people downloading photos of,

917
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,520
you know,

918
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,353
celebs,

919
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:50,990
you know,

920
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,890
without their clothes.

921
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:52,551
And I mean,

922
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,384
it's a very,

923
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,240
very technology as,

924
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,990
as tainted a whole lot of things.

925
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:58,040
As much as it's helped.

926
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:58,731
Well,

927
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,560
it's just made the world very strange.

928
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,870
It has.

929
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,320
What is the difference between
being famous then and famous now?

930
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:07,580
How much of a contrast as it,

931
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,613
um,

932
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,500
big contrast,

933
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:09,771
you know?

934
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:10,100
Yeah.

935
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:15,100
It's probably the difference between
what it was like to be president 50,

936
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:16,641
60,

937
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,260
70 years ago and today,

938
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,393
um,

939
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,600
the,

940
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,470
the kind of scandals that Clinton or,

941
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:24,890
or some of the other politicians have had,

942
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,290
all that stuff was still going on back,

943
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,183
you know,

944
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,950
in the time of FDR or Kennedy.

945
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,360
But it was just a,

946
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,270
it wasn't public knowledge.

947
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:35,811
It wasn't,

948
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:36,644
um,

949
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,150
you didn't see somebody,

950
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,840
somebody didn't walk out of a hotel
bedroom with somebody else and have their

951
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:43,350
picture taken and all of a sudden it was,

952
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,040
it was all

953
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,873
over the media.

954
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,010
So things have changed.

955
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,840
Um,

956
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,110
if you don't want people
to know something,

957
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:49,944
don't do it.

958
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,821
That's the only way.

959
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:51,010
Now,

960
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,080
that's the only way.

961
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,230
There are no secrets there are undone
because if there's you and somebody else,

962
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,183
they know.

963
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,660
Is that good or is that bad?

964
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,363
Um,

965
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,300
I,

966
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,080
I don't know.

967
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,770
I don't know.

968
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,230
It depends on how much
bad stuff you're doing.

969
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,831
Well,

970
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:08,664
it's a,

971
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,250
I don't even know if he
could say bad or good,

972
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:13,860
but it seems like there's a lot of
people that embrace it and exploit it.

973
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,281
Like,

974
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:18,840
do you remember for a long time it was
like for a year or so women were getting

975
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,710
accidentally photographed
with no panties on,

976
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:23,550
getting out of cars.

977
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,530
And it was pretty obvious by the,

978
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:27,180
it just the angle of the photograph.

979
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,380
Like how the fuck do you not know?

980
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:30,930
There's a camera down there from
guys looked down on his knees.

981
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,430
Yeah.

982
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,490
I'm not even on his knees.

983
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:35,700
I mean he's spread out on his stomach
with the camera up your dress.

984
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:35,940
You know,

985
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,990
they had to have known,

986
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,540
I mean it was like Paris Hilton
and a lot of these girls,

987
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:44,550
and I have to say that there are people
now who know how to manipulate and use

988
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:47,730
the media to their advantage.

989
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,190
Some people can become famous
for doing a porn film with some,

990
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:53,950
you know,

991
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,380
and leaking a film with them.

992
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:55,581
And,

993
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:56,414
and uh,

994
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,470
her name is Kim Kardashian.

995
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,380
You can call her my name man.

996
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:58,950
Really?

997
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,161
Yeah.

998
00:27:59,161 --> 00:27:59,761
You don't have to,

999
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,930
you don't have to beat around the bush,

1000
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,213
so to speak.

1001
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,350
I don't think she has a Bush.

1002
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,560
That's also what's changed
between then and now.

1003
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,360
They're gone.

1004
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,780
Yeah.

1005
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,910
Porn one when it came to the aesthetic.

1006
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,140
Yeah.

1007
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,321
Okay.

1008
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:13,471
Yeah,

1009
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:13,860
yeah,

1010
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,101
yeah,

1011
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:14,850
yeah.

1012
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,160
But,

1013
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,993
um,

1014
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,420
where are we going with this?

1015
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:18,810
Well,

1016
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,530
we're not going anywhere,

1017
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,363
but do you do,

1018
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,001
could you,

1019
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:21,330
uh,

1020
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:21,700
when you,

1021
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,400
when you see this day and age,

1022
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,860
could you imagine if kiss
has started off today,

1023
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,870
how different things we'd be fucked.

1024
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:28,560
I mean,

1025
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,560
in plain English because the music
industry as it exists today is not even an

1026
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:35,581
industry.

1027
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:36,600
It's just shambles.

1028
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,620
And now artists are in a position to have,

1029
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:43,590
to take what the public,

1030
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:44,424
so to speak,

1031
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,450
is willing to give them.

1032
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,493
In other words,

1033
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,280
with the,

1034
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,800
this,

1035
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,390
um,

1036
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:53,390
onset of file sharing or file sharing
is just a fancy way of saying stealing.

1037
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,240
You can't share what you don't own.

1038
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:03,050
The idea that somebody is taking songs
or music off the Internet and taking it

1039
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,840
for free and calling it file sharing,

1040
00:29:06,841 --> 00:29:08,100
it's like me saying,

1041
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:08,934
um,

1042
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,390
uh,

1043
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,230
transportation,

1044
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,150
borrowing and I steal your car.

1045
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,610
You know,

1046
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,100
it's,

1047
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,741
is it though?

1048
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:14,910
Because if you steal my car,

1049
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:15,930
I don't have a car anymore.

1050
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,420
But if you walk up to my car,

1051
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,770
make a copy of it and drive it
off and I paid him in the car,

1052
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:20,520
but you didn't,

1053
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:20,881
it doesn't,

1054
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:21,960
it doesn't work like that.

1055
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:27,190
And when people create art with the
hope of being not only accepted,

1056
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:34,790
but also being rewarded so that they can
pay their rent and send their kids to

1057
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:36,750
school and things like that.

1058
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,070
And that doesn't happen.

1059
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,593
That's,

1060
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,860
that's what's stealing does.

1061
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,550
But the person who,

1062
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:47,230
who steals on the Internet somehow doesn't
feel the same as going into a store

1063
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,620
and stealing a w a cassette,

1064
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,460
which don't,

1065
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,630
don't even exist anymore.

1066
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,400
But if you go into a story,

1067
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:58,180
if you're going to Barnes and noble
or someplace and steal a book that's

1068
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,110
blatantly and very clearly illegal,

1069
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,330
downloading something,

1070
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:09,331
somehow skirts be the ethical and
moral question of taking something that

1071
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:14,050
doesn't belong to you and
not paying the person for it.

1072
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,040
Look,

1073
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,431
for me,

1074
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:15,971
it's a,

1075
00:30:15,971 --> 00:30:18,640
it's a question more about morality.

1076
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:19,600
In my case,

1077
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,550
it's not going to change my life any,

1078
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,560
but it sure bothers me that somebody
is taking what they don't own.

1079
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,180
And it bothers me that somebody who's
trying to succeed now and starting off

1080
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,880
doesn't have a a chance in
hell more than likely have of,

1081
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:37,714
uh,

1082
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,300
ever getting that pot of gold,

1083
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:40,870
you know,

1084
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,790
but they get the pot of
gold in a different way.

1085
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:45,650
They get it through live performances
so that they're not getting it through

1086
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:46,830
themselves.

1087
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,001
Yeah.

1088
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:47,590
But,

1089
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,450
but that shouldn't be dictated to by the,

1090
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,730
by the circumstances.

1091
00:30:51,731 --> 00:30:52,960
That should be a choice.

1092
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,850
The idea while you're still getting it.

1093
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:55,120
Well,

1094
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,810
who are you to decide where I get my
money while you're still getting it over

1095
00:30:58,811 --> 00:30:59,230
there,

1096
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:03,250
but since when do you have
jurisdiction over my revenue?

1097
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:07,840
So I completely see your point and
I agree with you and a lot of ways,

1098
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:12,730
but I think that the reality of the times
we're living in like the digital world

1099
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:15,100
that we're living in property is just,

1100
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:15,761
it's a very,

1101
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:17,080
it's a weird term when you,

1102
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:18,790
when you talk about like digital property,

1103
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:20,420
like digital properties things down.

1104
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,030
So that's,

1105
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,711
that's true.

1106
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:24,640
And that's a problem,

1107
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:25,474
but it doesn't,

1108
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,850
it doesn't change the truth.

1109
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,420
And the truth is that what you don't own,

1110
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:33,910
you can't take for free.

1111
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,020
You can,

1112
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,000
but it's wrong.

1113
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,620
It's morally wrong.

1114
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:39,760
It's ethically wrong.

1115
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,661
And it hurts.

1116
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:42,710
People did,

1117
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,610
when the whole Napster controversy
was coming out to Mars,

1118
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:47,800
all rich was the public whipping boy.

1119
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,730
When he came out,

1120
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:49,140
the,

1121
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,390
the Lars Ulrich from
Metallica came out and he was,

1122
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:52,721
you know,

1123
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:53,141
saying,

1124
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:53,351
hey,

1125
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:54,310
you guys are stealing.

1126
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:55,390
We're going to take you to court.

1127
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,373
His is all theft.

1128
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,600
The backlash was tremendous.

1129
00:31:58,601 --> 00:31:58,901
I mean,

1130
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:02,140
he was thought of as persona non grata.

1131
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:02,381
I mean,

1132
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:05,020
people went after that
guy with a vengeance.

1133
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,180
A lot of artists sat back and waited
to see how the dust settled on that.

1134
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,163
Well,

1135
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,320
a lot of artists are wondering
where their royalties are now.

1136
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,280
You can't put milk back
in a bottle spilled milk.

1137
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:23,310
And unfortunately things
transpired that there's really no,

1138
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:25,490
no getting around at this point.

1139
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,373
Um,

1140
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,170
so was Lara's Adeline?

1141
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:30,431
No,

1142
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:30,740
he,

1143
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,420
he,

1144
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,210
he was just saying I should be paid.

1145
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,550
Has nothing to do with
whether he's wealthy or not.

1146
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,190
Who are you to dictate that he has enough?

1147
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:40,720
I,

1148
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,580
I agree with you,

1149
00:32:41,581 --> 00:32:45,360
but I think the way people were looking
at it that didn't have a vested interest

1150
00:32:45,361 --> 00:32:45,840
in it,

1151
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,160
the way they were looking at it is it's
very obvious that the reality of the

1152
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:54,510
world that we're living in is changing
radically as far as access to information

1153
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:59,040
and songs have become information once
they became digitized and it came ones

1154
00:32:59,041 --> 00:32:59,874
and Zeros.

1155
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:00,991
I agree.

1156
00:33:00,991 --> 00:33:01,560
You know,

1157
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:01,950
I'm not,

1158
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,090
not diminishing it in any way,

1159
00:33:03,091 --> 00:33:03,900
shape or form,

1160
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,100
but that art becomes information when
it becomes ones and Zeros and ones ones

1161
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:09,330
and zero's go online,

1162
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,710
they go online.

1163
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:11,311
I mean there's,

1164
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:11,640
it's,

1165
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,050
it's almost impossible to stem the
tide and we see a guy like Lars Ulrich

1166
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,790
stepping out there in the early days when
people may be thought that there was a

1167
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:21,311
way to put a,

1168
00:33:21,311 --> 00:33:24,140
a stop to this when people didn't tow.

1169
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,390
Napster was like the first thing people
didn't really understand bit torrent.

1170
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:29,940
They didn't understand a lot of the
other possibilities when it comes to

1171
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:30,511
downloading,

1172
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:31,380
sharing media.

1173
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,990
But now it seems inevitable.

1174
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,860
Is there a way to sort
of meet in the middle?

1175
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:43,100
Like I've always had this attitude where
if someone sends me something or a,

1176
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:44,551
you know,

1177
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:46,950
someone sends me a youtube link to a song,

1178
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,113
if I like it,

1179
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,520
I immediately buy the album immediately.

1180
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,480
I go to Itunes,

1181
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,500
I buy it right then and there,

1182
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:54,480
even if I'm not planning on
listening to it right now,

1183
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,460
out of respect for the artists

1184
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,050
song that I'm curious to hear that
I haven't heard in a long time.

1185
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,860
I buy it.

1186
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,540
But what if someone
sends you a youtube clip?

1187
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,733
Is that okay?

1188
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,550
Give me the shitty quality.

1189
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,210
You're listening to it on an iPhone
or on a laptop or something like that.

1190
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:12,800
Look,

1191
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,570
this is,

1192
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,210
there's a can of worms open here and I,

1193
00:34:15,211 --> 00:34:16,950
I really don't know what the answer is,

1194
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:21,951
but I do know that technology does
not take the place of morality.

1195
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,480
I'm not arguing you there.

1196
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,700
You were saying is it possible
to incorporate the both of them?

1197
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:26,821
Well,

1198
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:30,570
you were saying is it possible to
meet in the middle and I would say,

1199
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,370
why do I have to meet you in the middle?

1200
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:33,930
Why do I have to compromise?

1201
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,460
Because of circumstance.

1202
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,080
You should,

1203
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:42,860
you should respect my integrity and
you should respect my art instead of me

1204
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:44,240
going,

1205
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,420
all right while you got me.

1206
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:49,870
So I'll take 50 cents on the dollar
instead of you giving me the dollar my

1207
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,210
wrong.

1208
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,043
It's wrong.

1209
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,400
I see what you're saying.

1210
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:56,910
But like if someone sends
you a link and says,

1211
00:34:56,911 --> 00:34:57,744
Hey Paul,

1212
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,430
there's this fantastic band,

1213
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,920
you got to listen to this
and it's a youtube link.

1214
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,090
Do you just not click it?

1215
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:03,940
No,

1216
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,091
I,

1217
00:35:04,091 --> 00:35:04,820
I'll,

1218
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,090
I'll certainly watch it.

1219
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,580
How was that different than
like listened to the radio?

1220
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,500
I mean a lot of people found out about it.

1221
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:14,430
You guys from listening to a song on the
radio and then they went out and bought

1222
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:14,760
it.

1223
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,690
Is it the immediate access as opposed
to something being broadcast and on the

1224
00:35:18,691 --> 00:35:20,450
terms of the radio provider air?

1225
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:20,870
I,

1226
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,180
I'm,

1227
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,110
I'm not sure.

1228
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,160
I would say that whenever
money is changing hands,

1229
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,580
the artist should be a part of that.

1230
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,050
So if,

1231
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:36,150
if commercials are being showed
on Youtube and revenue is being,

1232
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,620
if there's a stream,

1233
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:39,750
then the artist should be sharing in that?

1234
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,703
Um,

1235
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,210
it's an interesting question because
if I saw a band on television,

1236
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,560
hopefully it,

1237
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,790
I would see somebody and go,

1238
00:35:49,791 --> 00:35:49,971
Gee,

1239
00:35:49,971 --> 00:35:52,660
I want to go buy their album
and I would go buy their albums.

1240
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:53,031
So it's a,

1241
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:54,140
it's a selling tool,

1242
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,880
but whenever money is generated either,

1243
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,410
um,

1244
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,950
firsthand or secondhand and
there's an artist's involve,

1245
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:08,240
the artist should be
compensated a unquestionably.

1246
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,810
But do you feel that there's a difference
between someone who sounded like

1247
00:36:11,811 --> 00:36:12,800
pirate copies?

1248
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,680
Like I used to always feel
real uncomfortable with
that when I'm being in New

1249
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,800
York and they would sell these
pirate copies of VHS tapes.

1250
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,580
Remember those?

1251
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,010
Or,

1252
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,300
or,

1253
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,880
or even cds when they first
figured out CD burners,

1254
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,760
people would sell like pirate
copies and I go boys that wrong.

1255
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,120
Yeah,

1256
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,953
that's wrong.

1257
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,760
That's everyone profiting though,

1258
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,480
right?

1259
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,601
Well,

1260
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:29,871
sure.

1261
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:32,270
Well isn't youtube pro profiting?

1262
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:32,901
Uh,

1263
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:33,171
yeah.

1264
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:33,950
Maybe they are.

1265
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,760
Yeah.

1266
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,001
Yeah.

1267
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:35,271
I mean,

1268
00:36:35,271 --> 00:36:36,104
I'm sure they are.

1269
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,740
Um,

1270
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,240
but dip file sharing,

1271
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,103
they're not right.

1272
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,900
We'll file sharing that.

1273
00:36:40,901 --> 00:36:41,734
You know,

1274
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,180
we go back to that people,

1275
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,590
people sharing

1276
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,690
artistic material,

1277
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,720
sharing anything that should
be paid for under some,

1278
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:54,870
you know,

1279
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:59,460
technical guys were
jargon is it's just wrong.

1280
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,420
Is there a way though to
reconcile with the times?

1281
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,191
I mean it's,

1282
00:37:04,191 --> 00:37:05,340
it's not going to change.

1283
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:07,110
File sharing is going to exist.

1284
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:07,531
Was it,

1285
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:09,450
was it Tom York in his band?

1286
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:10,284
Um,

1287
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,660
that didn't they do an album where they,

1288
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,060
they offered it on the Internet and said,

1289
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:15,894
just pay what,

1290
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,650
what you would like for Paul.

1291
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,770
They got nothing.

1292
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,910
That's a Radiohead do that.

1293
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,360
Yeah,

1294
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,100
it was Radiohead.

1295
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,370
Yeah.

1296
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:22,591
Yeah.

1297
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:23,131
So they did it.

1298
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:23,964
You know how much he got?

1299
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:24,720
Nothing.

1300
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,441
Didn't they get anything?

1301
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:26,760
I think you made some money off of that.

1302
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,360
Find out.

1303
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,860
Oh look.

1304
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,590
Yeah.

1305
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,460
Look and see what,

1306
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:31,200
what it averaged per album.

1307
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,700
That's a total hippie move,

1308
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:33,170
right?

1309
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:33,931
Pay What you want,

1310
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:34,351
man.

1311
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:34,501
Yeah.

1312
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:37,560
The total of the total stupid move.

1313
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,281
I should know this.

1314
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:39,660
I don't think they'll do that again.

1315
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,710
You don't think so?

1316
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,040
No.

1317
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,791
I'll see you.

1318
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:42,780
Most of these are high enough.

1319
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:43,230
They might.

1320
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:43,470
Yup.

1321
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,430
Most of the time.

1322
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,550
The guy who wants to share the
most has the least to share.

1323
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,660
It's true.

1324
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,470
That is so true.

1325
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:49,830
Yeah,

1326
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,663
that's very true.

1327
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,930
I used to work out this yoga studio and
it was a super hippie yoga place and

1328
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:55,070
these,

1329
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,903
to have a basket,

1330
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,970
you just pay whatever you want.

1331
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,450
And I watched ladies pull up in the range
rover workout and not put nothing in

1332
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:01,260
that basket.

1333
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:01,501
He said,

1334
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:03,690
drive me crazy to drive me fucking crazy.

1335
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:04,110
I'm like,

1336
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,520
you just pulled up in a range rover.

1337
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,630
You walked in,

1338
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,470
you did the yoga class
and you just laughed,

1339
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:09,910
you know?

1340
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,270
But I come from a a
different point of view.

1341
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:12,720
Well,

1342
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,270
I say to people as far as
charities or anything else,

1343
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,740
you don't give until it hurts.

1344
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,300
You give until it feels good.

1345
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,171
You know what,

1346
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:19,411
you,

1347
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:22,020
you know what's in your pocket and
you know what's in your bank account.

1348
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,820
And that's how you should give.

1349
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:28,710
You should give knowing what you can
give as opposed to the idea that you give

1350
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:29,544
grudgingly.

1351
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,840
I agree 100% but do you see
a possible point of view,

1352
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:35,100
and I'm playing devil's advocate here.

1353
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:35,950
Um,

1354
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,920
you see a possible point of view for
a young poor kid who doesn't have any

1355
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:39,520
money,

1356
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,680
who's a huge kiss fan who just,

1357
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,730
you know,

1358
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:45,490
wants to be able to listen to your
music and just can't afford it,

1359
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,720
can't afford to buy it.

1360
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,280
And so he downloads a copy

1361
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,613
cause he stealing.

1362
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,161
Sure.

1363
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:54,160
Of course he's stealing what
the circumstances don't change.

1364
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,200
Don't change morality.

1365
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,500
Circumstances don't change
what's ethically right and wrong.

1366
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:00,920
If,

1367
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,440
if there was no internet,

1368
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:06,550
would it be okay cause he really loves
kist to go into a record store back then

1369
00:39:06,551 --> 00:39:07,690
and and steal a record.

1370
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,690
Hell No.

1371
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:08,901
Right.

1372
00:39:08,901 --> 00:39:09,411
I agreed.

1373
00:39:09,411 --> 00:39:12,460
But isn't it different where it's a
physical copy that someone had to actually

1374
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:13,001
print up?

1375
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:14,650
I mean obviously your art created,

1376
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,580
it took a long time and a lot of effort
and work and creativity doesn't really

1377
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:20,160
matter if it's on vinyl or,

1378
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,150
or if it's access through a computer.

1379
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:25,210
The only difference is that if
someone's accessing it to a computer,

1380
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:27,910
I could send you a copy of something
and it just takes five seconds.

1381
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:28,310
I say,

1382
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,320
I hear you have a copy of this.

1383
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:29,920
So one,

1384
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,670
but it doesn't,

1385
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,720
nobody loses.

1386
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,770
What I'm saying is,

1387
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,603
of course we do.

1388
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,271
We do.

1389
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,740
If you were actually going to buy it,

1390
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,491
if you're going to buy it,

1391
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:36,791
I'm like,

1392
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,151
Paul,

1393
00:39:37,151 --> 00:39:38,530
save your millions.

1394
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,360
I'm going to give you this copy for free.

1395
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,820
Well then you know then maybe,

1396
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,280
but if you weren't going to buy it
anyway and someone just gives it to you,

1397
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,270
is it in pot?

1398
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,760
I mean that's one of the points of view
that people have today is that if you

1399
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,330
weren't going to,

1400
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,590
if I wasn't going to
buy a particular album,

1401
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,280
we're going back to records or
cassettes and you gave it to me.

1402
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,540
You already paid for it.

1403
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,890
So absolutely.

1404
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:59,920
So if you pay for something
and then give it to me,

1405
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,210
okay,

1406
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:01,661
maybe,

1407
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:02,620
maybe there's a,

1408
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,090
there's a point there,

1409
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:06,540
but the idea that you took something
for free and gave it to me.

1410
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,413
No.

1411
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,360
Well if I took something that I paid
for it and made a copy of it though,

1412
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,570
perhaps if it was one,

1413
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:14,220
you know,

1414
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,550
we were splitting split,

1415
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,833
we're splitting hairs,

1416
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,100
but I completely respect your opinion
and I complete respect your point of view

1417
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,083
and mind you,

1418
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,190
it doesn't change my life one bit.

1419
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,740
I think it's ethically and morally wrong,

1420
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:31,330
but my concern more is for somebody
who's up and coming or somebody who says,

1421
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:31,840
you know,

1422
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,640
I'm just doing this for the art of it.

1423
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,440
Well that's okay.

1424
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,450
You don't need money.

1425
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:39,790
Money may not matter to
you until you need money.

1426
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,840
You know?

1427
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,470
Um,

1428
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:41,711
I,

1429
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:42,790
I've known people who've said,

1430
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:43,220
you know,

1431
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,530
I'm just doing this because I love
doing it and I'm money's not important.

1432
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,760
Well that's because your bills are still
paid when the bill stop being paid,

1433
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:53,260
money's going to be real important.

1434
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:53,861
Yeah,

1435
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:54,131
I'm home.

1436
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:55,840
People always say money
doesn't buy you happiness.

1437
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:56,831
You're absolutely,

1438
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:57,664
totally correct.

1439
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,340
But being broke as fuck will make you sad.

1440
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,990
That's true too.

1441
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,330
And you can't afford food and
you have no place to live.

1442
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,600
That makes you sad if
you are broke as fuck.

1443
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,830
And then money comes along,

1444
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:12,670
you will be happier because you will have
food and you'll have a place to sleep.

1445
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:12,931
Well you,

1446
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:14,020
you certainly won't,

1447
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,730
you certainly won't.

1448
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,540
Um,

1449
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,380
saddle your unhappiness on the
fact that you don't have food.

1450
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:26,070
The great thing about having money and
success I found is that you stop putting

1451
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:33,661
the onus on things that have no
relevance to ultimately to your

1452
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,420
happiness or your state of mind.

1453
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,463
In other words,

1454
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,100
the idea that I'm not unhappy because the,

1455
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,790
I don't have money to pay the bills.

1456
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:44,630
I can pay the bills now and I'm
still unhappy what's going wrong.

1457
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,500
So I think that the great thing
about becoming successful hopefully,

1458
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,870
and sometimes it's people's
downfall and that's why,

1459
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:51,650
you know,

1460
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,610
people wind up with a shotgun in their
mouth or a needle in their arm is because

1461
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,740
they think that success is going to
buy them happiness and they wind up

1462
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,813
miserable.

1463
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,590
And then you have to,

1464
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:04,101
you know,

1465
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:06,240
you have your come to Jesus
moment when you get you,

1466
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:06,891
you decide,

1467
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:07,724
okay,

1468
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:11,990
what now you either you either
spend a whole lot of money on a,

1469
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:15,800
on psychiatry or therapy or
you start numbing yourself.

1470
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:16,700
Yeah.

1471
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,840
What I've found is the,

1472
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:19,380
the moment I started making money,

1473
00:42:19,381 --> 00:42:23,700
what happened was all of a sudden I felt
a weight lifted off of me where most of

1474
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:28,200
my life I was day to day bill to bill
worrying about how I'm gonna pay this.

1475
00:42:28,201 --> 00:42:28,800
How am I going to,

1476
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,280
you know,

1477
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,911
pay my rent,

1478
00:42:29,911 --> 00:42:30,780
put gas in my car.

1479
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,100
And then when I started making money,

1480
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:33,210
all of a sudden that went away.

1481
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:33,751
You know,

1482
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,490
I wasn't rich by any
stretch of the imagination,

1483
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:38,160
but I knew that I could pay
my bills and I was like,

1484
00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:38,820
Whoa,

1485
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:43,260
that's a huge relief that most people
really never get to experience in their

1486
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:43,720
life.

1487
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,640
Well also people tend to go,

1488
00:42:45,641 --> 00:42:46,720
if I had this,

1489
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,650
I would be happy.

1490
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,390
The great thing about having that is
finding out whether or not you're,

1491
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:53,710
you truly are happy.

1492
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,401
And,

1493
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:54,910
um,

1494
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:55,091
you know,

1495
00:42:55,091 --> 00:42:55,924
in my case,

1496
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,850
I was still pretty miserable.

1497
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,700
And that was really,

1498
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,290
that's really what my book is about.

1499
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,280
You know,

1500
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,490
I had a New York Times
number two bestseller and,

1501
00:43:06,491 --> 00:43:07,180
uh,

1502
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,430
the book is now in Swedish,

1503
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:10,690
Japanese,

1504
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,553
German,

1505
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,090
Italian,

1506
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,470
Portuguese,

1507
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,061
Spanish,

1508
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:16,894
and on and on.

1509
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,190
And really,

1510
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:18,431
you know,

1511
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:21,520
I was born deaf on one
side without a righty or,

1512
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:22,361
and,

1513
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:22,690
uh,

1514
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,870
in a family that wasn't very supportive.

1515
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,041
And,

1516
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:27,874
um,

1517
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,830
I thought that success was going to be
the key to contentment and happiness.

1518
00:43:32,831 --> 00:43:37,600
And like a lot of other people thankfully
became successful only to find out

1519
00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:39,310
that it didn't change anything.

1520
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,830
And then the struggle becomes,

1521
00:43:41,831 --> 00:43:42,400
okay,

1522
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,840
what's it going to take to be happy?

1523
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:49,810
Isn't it fascinating that a lot of people
that become really successful become

1524
00:43:49,811 --> 00:43:51,580
really successful because of a whole?

1525
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,331
Absolutely.

1526
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:58,331
Look that it takes a person with a,

1527
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,950
a plethora,

1528
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,960
a vast amount of insecurity to be
comfortable in front of a crowd.

1529
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,830
The fact that you want to get up in
front of a crowd and get approval from a,

1530
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:10,880
uh,

1531
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,190
a mass of people only says,

1532
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:14,541
I mean,

1533
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:16,700
it speaks volumes about your lack of,

1534
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:17,990
of um,

1535
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:18,920
self confidence.

1536
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,120
So just the fact that you want to
be an entertainer or a comedian,

1537
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:23,721
whatever it is,

1538
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:27,240
and being in the limelight means
that you're seeking approval that,

1539
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:32,190
that you innately don't have
a disproportionate amount of

1540
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:37,190
need for when it comes to attention when
it comes to love usually corresponds to

1541
00:44:38,671 --> 00:44:42,210
a lack of that same child to Lilly or

1542
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,283
adulthood.

1543
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:48,540
You're satiating that need as an
adult that probably was born out of,

1544
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:50,340
uh,

1545
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,173
your childhood.

1546
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,910
But at that point you can say,

1547
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:54,390
well,

1548
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:58,320
I can get this fixed every night
by going in front of an audience,

1549
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,160
which is only temporary,

1550
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,720
or let's,

1551
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:06,690
let's do some digging and figure
out what's really wrong here.

1552
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,950
And that will only enhance the
performance and everything else.

1553
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,390
It won't take the place of it.

1554
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,800
It will embellish it

1555
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,211
you,

1556
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,860
so you changed your motivation,

1557
00:45:15,861 --> 00:45:19,400
your motivation became
instead of just get love,

1558
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:23,090
just get all this love and get all
this fame and then I'll feel happy,

1559
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,600
then it becomes what then it'd be,

1560
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:26,300
well,

1561
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,133
you know,

1562
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,920
the fact that there's all these people
who drop like flies from all kinds of

1563
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:36,290
addictions is just proof.

1564
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,590
You know,

1565
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:36,861
that,

1566
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:41,861
that people can be famous and miserable
and it doesn't really satiate what's

1567
00:45:42,591 --> 00:45:43,670
wrong inside you.

1568
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,211
So,

1569
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:49,211
but it fame gives you an amazing
opportunity to go out there and seek help.

1570
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,380
And um,

1571
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:52,850
you know,

1572
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:53,810
when I was in my teens,

1573
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:56,960
I walked into a Mount
Sinai hospital in New York,

1574
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:59,300
went into the psychiatry,

1575
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:01,340
a division when I need some help.

1576
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:02,300
When you were in your team.

1577
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:02,750
Yeah.

1578
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,190
So it was before you were even famous.

1579
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:05,000
Sure,

1580
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,800
sure.

1581
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,633
Um,

1582
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,020
I've always been a survivor
and somebody who wanted to,

1583
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:11,854
um,

1584
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,810
not only succeed,

1585
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,980
not only survive,

1586
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:15,820
but thrive.

1587
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:21,060
So I found myself realizing that if
I kept on the path that my parents,

1588
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:24,723
um,

1589
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,110
were the role model for,

1590
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,300
I was going to be in a
whole lot of trouble.

1591
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,040
I want it to become successful.

1592
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:31,030
I loved music.

1593
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:31,923
Um,

1594
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:34,270
I certainly craved adulation,

1595
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,950
but I also knew that it wasn't,

1596
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,710
it wasn't really what was
going to make me happy.

1597
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,840
It wasn't going to make me content.

1598
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:45,370
It's fascinating that you had the
insight when you were just a teenager to

1599
00:46:45,371 --> 00:46:47,620
realize that this is a path
that's going to lead to doom.

1600
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,410
[inaudible] I think.

1601
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,360
I think a lot of people,

1602
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:52,933
um,

1603
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,340
maybe brush that aside and
actually have that within them.

1604
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,960
I think instinctively,

1605
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:59,310
um,

1606
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,740
we're animals and we sense danger and we,

1607
00:47:01,741 --> 00:47:02,400
we,

1608
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,110
we know more than we think we know.

1609
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:06,330
And then then we intellectualize too much.

1610
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:10,540
What was it that pushed you to
actually go to a hospital and talk to a

1611
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:11,374
psychiatrist?

1612
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:13,780
Um,

1613
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,780
my sister had a friend who was getting
this outpatient therapy at Mount Sinai

1614
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:20,680
hospital and it was like,

1615
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,120
I heard and I went,

1616
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:23,290
really?

1617
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,790
You pay $3 and you,

1618
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:25,360
you,

1619
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,160
you see somebody and you talk.

1620
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:28,450
And I had no idea what they were.

1621
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,230
[inaudible] was all,

1622
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:29,830
I thought.

1623
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,260
Somebody sits in a room and
tells you how to live your life.

1624
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,461
And,

1625
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:34,240
uh,

1626
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,370
I took us a bus to the subway,

1627
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:38,740
took a few subways and walked in there.

1628
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:39,011
And,

1629
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:39,844
uh,

1630
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:44,080
I knew I needed more than what I had,

1631
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,900
although I didn't know
what it was that I needed.

1632
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,730
But you know,

1633
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,870
that that was part of the,

1634
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:51,470
the,

1635
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:52,303
the search.

1636
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,820
So is that what you would call depression?

1637
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:55,140
I mean,

1638
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,410
[inaudible] you know,

1639
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,040
being born with any kind of difference,

1640
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:01,360
any kind of facial difference,

1641
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:04,450
deformity or whatever
makes you incredibly,

1642
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:05,680
not only vulnerable,

1643
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:06,821
but you're,

1644
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:11,821
you're exposed to a point
of never being able to hide.

1645
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,040
If you put on some
ridiculous shirt with a,

1646
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:15,520
uh,

1647
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,620
a monkey holding dumbbells
or something else.

1648
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,170
Yeah.

1649
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,003
Kettlebells,

1650
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:20,950
um,

1651
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,690
if you put on a shirt that's,

1652
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:24,700
everybody starts laughing at you,

1653
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:25,570
go home and change.

1654
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,890
But if you have a facial difference or
you have something that sets you apart,

1655
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,840
you can never go home and change.

1656
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,490
So the scrutiny that you're,

1657
00:48:33,491 --> 00:48:35,230
you're under his is unbearable.

1658
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:37,960
So that's something I went
through from the time I was

1659
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,013
preschool.

1660
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,040
And,

1661
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:42,873
um,

1662
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,530
you've started to build up to fences and
at some point you don't even know who

1663
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:48,430
you once were.

1664
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,773
Um,

1665
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,630
so that's what it was all born out of.

1666
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:52,911
And,

1667
00:48:52,911 --> 00:48:53,291
and,

1668
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:54,124
uh,

1669
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,410
you know,

1670
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:55,751
I'm,

1671
00:48:55,751 --> 00:48:57,640
I'm not the person who
lives with a two thing.

1672
00:48:57,641 --> 00:48:59,440
I'm the person who goes
and gets the root canal.

1673
00:48:59,470 --> 00:48:59,740
You know,

1674
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,340
I,

1675
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,020
I don't want to suffer.

1676
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,280
I want to,

1677
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,510
I want to dig and go
through whatever ugly and,

1678
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,890
and work it out.

1679
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,813
And,

1680
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,360
you know,

1681
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,940
that's really what my whole
life's been been about.

1682
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:14,303
Um,

1683
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:19,620
I couldn't have written my book if I'm
still in the midst of that depression and

1684
00:49:21,281 --> 00:49:24,340
insecurity and unhappiness
and unfulfilled.

1685
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:24,581
Well,

1686
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:26,170
I don't want anybody to feel sorry for me.

1687
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,131
I've had no,

1688
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:27,851
you just being honest.

1689
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:29,410
I've had spectacular women.

1690
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:29,890
You know,

1691
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:30,670
I've had,

1692
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,430
I've had more great
times than anybody could,

1693
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,600
could ever imagine.

1694
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,280
They would transitory,

1695
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:37,870
but they were spectacular.

1696
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:39,063
Um,

1697
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:44,050
but happiness ultimately comes
from the most simple things,

1698
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,760
interaction with people,

1699
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:47,200
great friends,

1700
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,840
family and inner contentment.

1701
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:50,743
Um,

1702
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:52,330
when you step off the stage,

1703
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:53,890
you leave that crowd.

1704
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:54,701
They would look,

1705
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:59,110
I did shows in Madison Square Garden and
you may have been at one of them where

1706
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,540
I would walk off stage after eight,

1707
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:06,600
18,000 people went crazy and I went to
a deli by myself and when nobody would

1708
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:11,050
fucking believe I'm here by myself
and I just stepped off the stage.

1709
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,460
So there's a,

1710
00:50:12,461 --> 00:50:13,310
there's a,

1711
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,050
uh,

1712
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:19,050
a huge chasm between who you are in the
public and who you are off stage and the

1713
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:23,410
person offstage is the
person you have to live with.

1714
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,740
And managing that bizarre dichotomy,

1715
00:50:26,741 --> 00:50:28,130
this input

1716
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,720
must be very strange to oh,

1717
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:31,340
it's going from one to the other.

1718
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:31,670
Yeah,

1719
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:32,750
I mean credible extremes.

1720
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,590
It's a huge struggle and it takes a lot
of people down and no one could tell you

1721
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:37,400
how to do it either.

1722
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,330
No one else knows.

1723
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,111
No Paul,

1724
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:40,100
you're going to be fine.

1725
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:40,911
Like fuck,

1726
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:41,744
are you talking about?

1727
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,130
And it's the same thing.

1728
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,780
I can't give anybody advice.

1729
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,673
I can,

1730
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,290
I can tell you what I did,

1731
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,850
but that is going to work for
you is beyond presumptuous.

1732
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:54,050
It's idiotic for me to,

1733
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:54,830
I never,

1734
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:58,910
I never spent a a day a week later.

1735
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,800
I have never spend a minute in your shoes.

1736
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:02,960
I have no idea what your life is like.

1737
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:03,794
So,

1738
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,760
um,

1739
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,690
my advice,

1740
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,050
I can't say do it this way.

1741
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:11,330
You have to figure it out.

1742
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:11,631
Well,

1743
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:13,160
I think better than advice,

1744
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:18,161
what you've done is in
your book explaining with
extreme honesty how you felt

1745
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,090
about those situations,

1746
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:24,950
how you felt as a young man
growing up with this situation,

1747
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:25,784
with your ear,

1748
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,431
be you,

1749
00:51:26,431 --> 00:51:28,880
you give people insight into someone who,

1750
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:29,420
you know,

1751
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,980
a lot of people look
at you and they'll go,

1752
00:51:30,981 --> 00:51:31,800
this guy's not really,

1753
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,930
never had a hard day in his life.

1754
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,100
He's fucking Paul Stanley,

1755
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:34,550
man.

1756
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:34,731
Like,

1757
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:35,600
look at him up there.

1758
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:36,320
I mean,

1759
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:36,831
come on.

1760
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,281
How was that?

1761
00:51:37,281 --> 00:51:37,911
How was it?

1762
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:38,061
Oh,

1763
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,470
he's the lead singer of fucking kiss.

1764
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,910
Come on and loved me and yeah,

1765
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:43,120
and the great thing down,

1766
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:45,973
come on man.

1767
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:46,580
How could,

1768
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,630
how could you be sad?

1769
00:51:47,631 --> 00:51:48,530
How could it be bad?

1770
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:49,240
But how,

1771
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,490
how great a feeling to
be able to say to people,

1772
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:52,761
you know,

1773
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:53,570
something,

1774
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,310
I'm not that different than you are,

1775
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,270
but you're not.

1776
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:57,770
You really aren't an I'm really not.

1777
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,371
That is the key.

1778
00:51:58,371 --> 00:51:58,790
Right?

1779
00:51:58,790 --> 00:51:59,570
I think so.

1780
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:00,051
I think,

1781
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:00,884
um,

1782
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,120
I think separating yourself from people
or not sharing with them how much you

1783
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:09,110
are like them does a disservice to both,

1784
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,243
you know,

1785
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,083
look,

1786
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,740
I make the analogy,

1787
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:13,300
you know,

1788
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,230
you can live your life like that.

1789
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,820
It protects,

1790
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,170
it protects you,

1791
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:20,030
but you get nothing.

1792
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:20,751
You know,

1793
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:21,041
you,

1794
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:23,360
you can hit people and push them away,

1795
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,320
but it's not until you're willing to open
up your hand giving it becomes its own

1796
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:29,330
reward whether you're
giving to people with,

1797
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:30,164
um,

1798
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:31,760
support or inspiration.

1799
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:33,560
Are you giving people monetarily,

1800
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:34,723
um,

1801
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:39,620
charity or charitable spirit is
ultimately the most rewarding?

1802
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:40,371
You know,

1803
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:44,160
one of the most rewarding things
I've ever been able to experience is,

1804
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,240
is giving and helping others
giving until it feels good.

1805
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:47,821
Yeah.

1806
00:52:47,821 --> 00:52:48,380
Like you said.

1807
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,213
Yeah.

1808
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:49,461
Yeah.

1809
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:49,571
I,

1810
00:52:49,571 --> 00:52:50,420
I agree with that.

1811
00:52:50,421 --> 00:52:55,421
I think being generous is a very
underrated activity and until you do it,

1812
00:52:56,511 --> 00:52:58,130
and quite honestly,

1813
00:52:58,131 --> 00:52:58,461
when,

1814
00:52:58,461 --> 00:53:00,290
when it was explained to me,

1815
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:01,580
it seemed ridiculous,

1816
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:07,460
but when you stop judging
other people and you accept,

1817
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,533
look,

1818
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:11,840
it's very easy to look at some guy
panhandling on the street and say,

1819
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,340
why don't you go get a job?

1820
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:18,890
You have no idea what that person is
living or what nightmare he goes through.

1821
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:23,780
Or she goes through every day would
giving them some money or giving them some

1822
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:24,614
food.

1823
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,160
Really Change

1824
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,701
Your Life.

1825
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:27,030
Any,

1826
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,900
maybe it'll,

1827
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:28,770
it'll help them,

1828
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,190
but what do you have to lose it?

1829
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,400
It should feel good to do that instead
of kicking somebody who's down.

1830
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,820
It's a small person who tries to
make someone else feel smaller.

1831
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:39,391
Well,

1832
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:44,391
you've done a great job in your book of
being a vulnerable and very open and in

1833
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:51,420
a way that a lot of people fail
when it comes to autobiographies.

1834
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,820
Autobiographies are very tricky animals.

1835
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:57,900
George Orwell said that the autobiography
is the most outrageous form of fiction

1836
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,093
and,

1837
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:03,870
and that's probably why I never wanted
to write one because to just bolster

1838
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:08,871
yourself up or to have bragging rights
about something that may not have even

1839
00:54:09,181 --> 00:54:12,930
happened is pointless for me.

1840
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:18,230
The epiphany came when I realized that
I could write a book that my children

1841
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,030
would benefit from when
they were old enough.

1842
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:22,860
I have a 20 year old and a three year old,

1843
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:23,933
so

1844
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,550
my 20 year olds read it.

1845
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:27,150
And I,

1846
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:31,710
I think it's important for when you're
successful for your children to know what

1847
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:36,711
it took for you to become successful and
that it perhaps wasn't as easy and that

1848
00:54:37,081 --> 00:54:39,090
the road wasn't as smooth.

1849
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:40,320
Um,

1850
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:44,940
so my whole reason to ride
my story started there,

1851
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:49,941
but then it started to snow ball in
the sense that I began to realize that

1852
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:56,340
there's a lot of people out there who
could use some inspiration and also some

1853
00:54:56,341 --> 00:55:01,341
insight because we all tend to think of
ourselves as singular and nobodies like

1854
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:02,610
us.

1855
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:02,881
Boy,

1856
00:55:02,881 --> 00:55:04,440
I'm fucked up and nobody else,

1857
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,011
you know,

1858
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:05,850
goes through this.

1859
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,650
And when somebody else says,

1860
00:55:07,651 --> 00:55:08,484
Hey,

1861
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,190
I'm afraid of this or I'm afraid of that.

1862
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,300
Oh you are too.

1863
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:13,770
We,

1864
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:18,770
we feel much more secure and bonded
when we share what we have in common.

1865
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:23,081
Yeah,

1866
00:55:23,081 --> 00:55:23,800
without a doubt.

1867
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,461
Without a doubt.

1868
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:25,990
And I think that you,

1869
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:26,501
like I said,

1870
00:55:26,501 --> 00:55:30,130
I think you've done a great service by
being so open in a very difficult way.

1871
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:35,340
And it's very rare for rock stars
especially to open themselves up and be

1872
00:55:35,591 --> 00:55:36,101
vulnerable.

1873
00:55:36,101 --> 00:55:36,934
If they do,

1874
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:37,960
it's always about some shit.

1875
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:38,771
They don't do any more like,

1876
00:55:38,771 --> 00:55:38,921
oh,

1877
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:41,160
I was doing fucking
heroin and I was shooting.

1878
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:41,481
I was like,

1879
00:55:41,481 --> 00:55:41,780
yeah,

1880
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,613
fuck on stage.

1881
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:46,080
But I'm done with that now I'm all
been clean for a couple hours and uh,

1882
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:46,990
I wrote a book,

1883
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:47,231
look,

1884
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:49,000
everybody has their path and,

1885
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,980
and I would never trivialize,

1886
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:51,850
um,

1887
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:55,870
addiction because addiction
is well documented.

1888
00:55:55,871 --> 00:55:56,920
It's a,

1889
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:57,540
you know,

1890
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:01,510
a disease that some of
us are predisposed to.

1891
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:03,550
And those are those people I say,

1892
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:03,851
look,

1893
00:56:03,851 --> 00:56:06,820
if you are predisposed to that
and if it runs in your family,

1894
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:12,100
get help before you get into the drugs
are before you get into the alcohol.

1895
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:17,050
If you feel that urge much better to
start controlling it before you immerse

1896
00:56:17,051 --> 00:56:17,884
yourself in it.

1897
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:18,933
Um,

1898
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,100
you know,

1899
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:21,850
look,

1900
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:22,500
I'm,

1901
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,260
I'm not,

1902
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,400
I'm a rock star.

1903
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:25,660
I'm a musician,

1904
00:56:25,661 --> 00:56:26,860
whatever you want to call it.

1905
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:28,450
But I'm a person.

1906
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:29,770
I'm a dad.

1907
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,790
I'm a husband,

1908
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:35,620
so I don't how I live my life should,

1909
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,060
how anybody lives here.

1910
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:39,970
Lives should not be dictated
by their profession.

1911
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:41,411
So whoa,

1912
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:41,771
you know,

1913
00:56:41,771 --> 00:56:43,430
this is a great book as rock rockstars.

1914
00:56:43,431 --> 00:56:44,264
Don't I go,

1915
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,573
you know,

1916
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:50,850
I'm a rockstar maybe two hours
a night when I'm on tour,

1917
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,280
yet you have to have a real life,

1918
00:56:54,281 --> 00:56:55,330
a complete life.

1919
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,070
Otherwise you,

1920
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,670
you're shortchanging yourself and
probably shortchanging other people.

1921
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:01,863
But isn't it,

1922
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,300
I know a lot of people,

1923
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,810
particularly in bands or,

1924
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:05,620
or,

1925
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,453
um,

1926
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,473
uh,

1927
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,610
film actors who don't want to go home.

1928
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:11,470
I get it.

1929
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:11,771
They won't,

1930
00:57:11,771 --> 00:57:14,170
don't want to go home
because they have nothing.

1931
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:19,360
They either don't have family or they
don't have something that satisfies them

1932
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:20,830
and makes them feel whole.

1933
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:24,280
And I think what we all are ourselves,

1934
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,540
I certainly think so is
to go out and find what,

1935
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:32,590
what you need to feel contentment
without the approval of,

1936
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:34,150
of the masses.

1937
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,300
I agree with you wholeheartedly,

1938
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,660
but I think that a lot of rock stars,

1939
00:57:38,661 --> 00:57:39,710
a lot of actors,

1940
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:44,150
they want to portray an image and
that image is very valuable to them.

1941
00:57:44,151 --> 00:57:48,770
They want to what they call protect
their brand and by divulging any past

1942
00:57:48,771 --> 00:57:52,190
insecurities or by showing any
chinks in their armor emotionally,

1943
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:53,061
they feel like,

1944
00:57:53,061 --> 00:57:53,240
you know,

1945
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,990
somehow or another this will be either
used against them or it'll diminish the

1946
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,471
publish.

1947
00:57:57,471 --> 00:57:57,920
The wizard of Oz

1948
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,110
was perception becomes reality.

1949
00:58:00,111 --> 00:58:00,620
Yes.

1950
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,410
And if you put something
out there and people buy it,

1951
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,240
that's who you are.

1952
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,190
However,

1953
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:06,450
the,

1954
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,020
the,

1955
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:11,630
the problem with it is that other people
will see you as what you've put out

1956
00:58:11,631 --> 00:58:12,050
there,

1957
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:12,561
but you know,

1958
00:58:12,561 --> 00:58:13,394
you're not,

1959
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:14,560
that's,

1960
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,620
that's a real heavy cross to bear in a,

1961
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:18,830
you know,

1962
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:19,220
to,

1963
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:24,220
to accomplish what you set out for
and have the public perceive you to be

1964
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:29,150
something amazing and
still you feel like crap.

1965
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:33,260
I recommend figuring out what you,

1966
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:38,000
what you need to feel good about yourself
because you're going to need that

1967
00:58:38,001 --> 00:58:42,470
constant fix of people telling you
you're great and the moment it stops,

1968
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,490
you ain't great.

1969
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,020
I've never had a problem with depression,

1970
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:48,760
but I'm had a lot of friends who have,

1971
00:58:48,761 --> 00:58:50,830
and so I've always
wondered what is the cause,

1972
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:53,170
whether it is a circumstantial,

1973
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:54,240
whether it's the,

1974
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,530
the experiences that
they have in their life,

1975
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:57,430
whether it's genetic,

1976
00:58:57,431 --> 00:58:59,140
where it's a combination of both.

1977
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:00,340
Um,

1978
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,173
for you,

1979
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:03,220
when you started to get over this,

1980
00:59:03,221 --> 00:59:04,360
like when you're 19,

1981
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:05,650
how old were you when you went to the,

1982
00:59:05,651 --> 00:59:06,250
uh,

1983
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,230
I started signer.

1984
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,510
I started therapy when I was probably 16.

1985
00:59:10,511 --> 00:59:11,290
16.

1986
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:12,400
So he's 16.

1987
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,440
He'd go into this doctor's office.

1988
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:15,670
How long was it,

1989
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,230
because this is before.

1990
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:18,363
What time when,

1991
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:19,900
how old were you when you guys hit it?

1992
00:59:19,901 --> 00:59:20,410
Big.

1993
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:21,250
20.

1994
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:21,920
Let's see.

1995
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,480
21,

1996
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,800
maybe 22 something.

1997
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:25,660
Goddamn,

1998
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,420
that's young.

1999
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,070
It is.

2000
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,070
She's just,

2001
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,023
it's,

2002
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:29,370
it's,

2003
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:29,930
uh,

2004
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:30,890
that must have been nuts.

2005
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,101
Yeah.

2006
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:34,010
It's like getting the keys to the
candy store and lots of candy,

2007
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:34,240
you know,

2008
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,320
was getting the keys
to the fucking factory.

2009
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,213
Yes.

2010
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:37,610
Yeah.

2011
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:38,620
To make your own candy.

2012
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,650
Make your own candy.

2013
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:40,281
Say Hey,

2014
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:42,120
why don't you put some
more sprinkles in this?

2015
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:42,963
All right Paul,

2016
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,331
what do you want?

2017
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,680
Sprinkles in the shape of a star.

2018
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:46,514
Let's do it.

2019
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:49,783
Um,

2020
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,810
I needed a lifeline and that's
what their puppy was for me.

2021
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,690
I don't know that it
changed my life initially,

2022
00:59:57,691 --> 00:59:58,590
but it changed.

2023
00:59:59,070 --> 00:59:59,281
Look,

2024
00:59:59,281 --> 00:59:59,641
if you,

2025
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:00,810
if you go work out,

2026
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:01,860
you know,

2027
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,330
when you first start working out,

2028
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,340
you don't see results immediately,

2029
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:07,260
but you have the hope and the hope is,

2030
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:10,140
is what drives you is the desire.

2031
01:00:10,141 --> 01:00:11,820
And knowing that if I do this,

2032
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,790
the end product will be satisfying.

2033
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,570
So I booked therapies,

2034
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,050
no different therapy,

2035
01:00:19,051 --> 01:00:23,270
like everything else that it's
not an immediate gratification or,

2036
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:25,200
or an immediate solution,

2037
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,910
but it gives you the,

2038
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:27,810
the,

2039
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:28,410
the,

2040
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,243
um,

2041
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,840
knowledge that you're on a path.

2042
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,880
I'm doing something about this.

2043
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:33,780
Um,

2044
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,460
I'm working towards a goal.

2045
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:36,900
I want to lose that stomach.

2046
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:37,291
You know,

2047
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:39,060
I want to do 10 more reps,

2048
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,230
whatever it is.

2049
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:41,423
Um,

2050
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,810
so that's what it was for me.

2051
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,270
And then when the band started and,

2052
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,270
and then I stopped for a while and
when the band started to make it,

2053
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,180
I called,

2054
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:49,710
uh,

2055
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,000
a psychiatrist and said,

2056
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,900
I need this ride is about to begin.

2057
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:58,230
And I'm going up on the rollercoaster it,

2058
01:00:58,231 --> 01:00:58,411
click,

2059
01:00:58,411 --> 01:00:58,621
click,

2060
01:00:58,621 --> 01:00:59,510
click and click,

2061
01:00:59,520 --> 01:00:59,821
click,

2062
01:00:59,821 --> 01:01:00,121
click,

2063
01:01:00,121 --> 01:01:00,600
click.

2064
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,780
And there's no getting off now
and I need something to hold onto.

2065
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,920
What was the general,

2066
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:06,330
what was your main concern?

2067
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,493
Um,

2068
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:09,743
just

2069
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:11,430
that,

2070
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:11,851
that's it.

2071
01:01:11,851 --> 01:01:12,990
That's a tough one.

2072
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:14,183
Well,

2073
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:19,700
the pitfalls of success and
the vices are all tied up with,

2074
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:22,591
once again,

2075
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:23,424
insecurities.

2076
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:28,700
So either you're numbing yourself
or you're participating in,

2077
01:01:30,481 --> 01:01:32,250
in drugs because,

2078
01:01:32,251 --> 01:01:32,730
uh,

2079
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,600
it's cool.

2080
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:34,720
You know,

2081
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:35,790
there's all kinds of,

2082
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:36,983
um,

2083
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,540
there's all kinds of poisons out there.

2084
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,351
And,

2085
01:01:40,351 --> 01:01:41,184
um,

2086
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,660
when they're available,

2087
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,450
it's kind of hard to say no.

2088
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,800
It's kind of hard to say no.

2089
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:47,963
Um,

2090
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,720
I just thought I,

2091
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:51,720
I'd go off the rails a bit,

2092
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:52,763
not a bit.

2093
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:57,090
I thought I was thinking this
is a recipe for disaster.

2094
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:01,960
It's amazing that you had that kind of
insight as a young man experiencing fame,

2095
01:02:01,961 --> 01:02:03,220
especially with your background,

2096
01:02:03,221 --> 01:02:05,830
your childhood being bullied
and feeling insecure,

2097
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,930
and then all of a sudden it's
all coming at and you're like,

2098
01:02:07,931 --> 01:02:08,950
Whoa,

2099
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,200
I don't think my fucking
surf board this wave.

2100
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:11,800
That's right.

2101
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:11,940
And,

2102
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:12,640
and that's,

2103
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,140
that's actually what it was.

2104
01:02:14,141 --> 01:02:14,501
It was like,

2105
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:15,334
Whoa,

2106
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,870
I am not equipped for this.

2107
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,070
You know,

2108
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:18,730
this is,

2109
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:21,450
I this and I've worked
my ass off to get it,

2110
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:22,643
but wow,

2111
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,590
now it's in front of me
and that's a big ass wave,

2112
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:26,910
you know?

2113
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:27,743
And uh,

2114
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:28,741
so yeah,

2115
01:02:28,741 --> 01:02:30,720
I paddled out against the car and,

2116
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:31,110
and,

2117
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:31,531
and,

2118
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:31,860
uh,

2119
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,120
then I had to ride the wave.

2120
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:38,890
I just find it very admirable that you
were able to see that so early and so

2121
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:39,924
young.

2122
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,700
That's a very rare quality.

2123
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:43,163
Well,

2124
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:44,723
so I hear,

2125
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:45,391
so you hear,

2126
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:46,020
so I hear,

2127
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,210
but that being said,

2128
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,550
the,

2129
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:53,460
the great thing is I've
talked to other kids,

2130
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:55,560
I've talked to kids with facial problems,

2131
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:57,300
I've talked to their parents,

2132
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:00,480
and that's something that's Cathartic.

2133
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:05,010
That's something that's great for me
because once I started sharing my issues

2134
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,050
and the struggles that I had,

2135
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:12,570
I could see that I was lightening
the load for somebody else.

2136
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:13,530
You know,

2137
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,690
it's very easy for parents to say,

2138
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:15,931
Oh,

2139
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:17,250
you're just like everybody else.

2140
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,200
I think most of that comes out of guilt.

2141
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,700
I think most of that comes out of,

2142
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:23,880
you want to believe that because
you feel terrible for your child,

2143
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,920
but your child doesn't need to hear that.

2144
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:27,060
Your child needs to hear.

2145
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:29,430
Yeah,

2146
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,690
life is tougher for you.

2147
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,270
I'd rather I'll sit
down with a kid and say,

2148
01:03:33,271 --> 01:03:34,440
I don't know what you've heard,

2149
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,780
but life is tougher for you.

2150
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:37,650
It,

2151
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,360
but it can have a happy ending,

2152
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,460
but it won't be as easy as it is.

2153
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:41,671
The,

2154
01:03:41,671 --> 01:03:43,920
the playing field's not
level for everybody.

2155
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:45,390
And um,

2156
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:46,343
yeah,

2157
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:49,020
yours is going to be a harder path to go.

2158
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:51,150
And I try to sit with parents and say,

2159
01:03:51,151 --> 01:03:51,984
listen,

2160
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:52,350
you're,

2161
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,420
your kid's not looking
for a solution from you.

2162
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:56,340
When he tells you what's bothering him,

2163
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,230
he's looking to be validated.

2164
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:59,520
He just wants to be heard.

2165
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:02,430
And if you minimize what he's saying,

2166
01:04:02,431 --> 01:04:05,370
how often you think he's going to talk
to you or she's going to talk to you.

2167
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:06,181
So,

2168
01:04:06,181 --> 01:04:07,014
um,

2169
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:10,380
it's a great sense of

2170
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:13,530
satisfaction of,

2171
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:16,220
of being able to go out there and,

2172
01:04:16,221 --> 01:04:17,490
and give something,

2173
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,690
give something back.

2174
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:19,470
It's,

2175
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:24,470
it's really one of the greatest gifts of
my life is being at a point now where I

2176
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:28,200
can give back and,

2177
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:33,201
and feel like I'm doing something other
than making people happy with music and

2178
01:04:33,361 --> 01:04:34,021
make an impact,

2179
01:04:34,021 --> 01:04:35,040
not just one on one,

2180
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:36,600
but you could reach millions.

2181
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:37,320
Yeah.

2182
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:37,531
You know,

2183
01:04:37,531 --> 01:04:38,364
the,

2184
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,680
obviously this book,

2185
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:40,921
you know,

2186
01:04:40,921 --> 01:04:45,921
face the music seems to have resonated
with people because it's not being looked

2187
01:04:47,161 --> 01:04:48,030
at as a,

2188
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:51,300
another one of those rock
and roll autobiographies,

2189
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:54,680
which honestly really should
be on a roll of tissue paper.

2190
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:55,563
So you could,

2191
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,290
you could use it for
something more appropriate.

2192
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:58,981
But,

2193
01:04:58,981 --> 01:04:59,520
um,

2194
01:04:59,520 --> 01:04:59,701
you know,

2195
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:03,100
it seems to resonate with people and the
word I hear from people is that they're

2196
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:04,050
inspired by it.

2197
01:05:04,051 --> 01:05:05,790
And you know,

2198
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:06,180
my,

2199
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:06,750
my,

2200
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,330
my journey is not that
different than somebody else's.

2201
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:14,390
And maybe it makes it easier knowing that
somebody who you look up to is on the

2202
01:05:14,551 --> 01:05:15,360
same path.

2203
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:15,991
Unquestionably.

2204
01:05:15,991 --> 01:05:16,800
It makes it easier.

2205
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,190
Did ever go off the rails

2206
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:18,491
at all?

2207
01:05:18,491 --> 01:05:23,230
Did you ever have a moment where you
indulged in drugs or alcohol or anything

2208
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:23,860
crazy?

2209
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:24,120
I mean,

2210
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:24,820
I,

2211
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:25,940
drinking was always,

2212
01:05:25,941 --> 01:05:26,774
yeah,

2213
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:27,843
yeah.

2214
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:30,950
Life's too short to drink bad wine,

2215
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:31,641
you know.

2216
01:05:31,641 --> 01:05:31,851
And,

2217
01:05:31,851 --> 01:05:35,210
and one of the great thing is
to be able to afford good wine.

2218
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:35,960
So,

2219
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,260
um,

2220
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:39,500
but my early days I drank and uh,

2221
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,480
drugs little,

2222
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:41,810
you know,

2223
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:42,531
little dabbling,

2224
01:05:42,531 --> 01:05:45,230
but it was different
back then because people,

2225
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,560
people didn't see the correlation between
certain drugs and working your way to

2226
01:05:51,561 --> 01:05:52,394
other drugs.

2227
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:53,630
Um,

2228
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:54,111
and look,

2229
01:05:54,111 --> 01:05:56,270
I saw in my neighborhood,

2230
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,770
kids were doing acid and getting,

2231
01:05:57,771 --> 01:05:58,604
uh,

2232
01:05:58,700 --> 01:05:59,533
you know,

2233
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,590
putting the booby hatch,

2234
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:00,861
you know,

2235
01:06:00,861 --> 01:06:01,970
people are getting committed.

2236
01:06:01,971 --> 01:06:02,990
So I said,

2237
01:06:02,991 --> 01:06:03,110
okay,

2238
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:03,680
be hatched.

2239
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,420
I haven't heard that a long time.

2240
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:05,601
Well,

2241
01:06:05,601 --> 01:06:05,871
you know,

2242
01:06:05,871 --> 01:06:10,871
I'm a little older than you boobie
boobie hatch in the nuthouse.

2243
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:12,650
Um,

2244
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:13,483
so

2245
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:14,610
I stayed away from,

2246
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:15,930
I even then I said,

2247
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:16,230
well,

2248
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:16,681
acid,

2249
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,180
for me that's like a one way trip.

2250
01:06:18,181 --> 01:06:18,780
I'm not,

2251
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,040
I know I buy that ticket,

2252
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:20,910
I'm not coming back.

2253
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,830
So there was certain things I didn't do.

2254
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:23,480
My,

2255
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,620
my indulgence was always sex,

2256
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:26,700
you know,

2257
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,180
and,

2258
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:28,013
and uh,

2259
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:29,790
that was a good one.

2260
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:30,750
You know,

2261
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:31,020
that,

2262
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,220
that was pretty,

2263
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,473
pretty awesome.

2264
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:37,200
So how does a psychiatrist
or psychologist,

2265
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:38,034
whichever one it is,

2266
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,440
how does someone help a guy like you?

2267
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,410
Because I would think that you would
have to have some sort of perspective.

2268
01:06:43,411 --> 01:06:44,820
Like if a person is,

2269
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,410
if I'd come to a psychiatrist,

2270
01:06:46,411 --> 01:06:46,591
say,

2271
01:06:46,591 --> 01:06:47,041
Hey man,

2272
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,520
I'm an insurance salesman and a,

2273
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:49,261
I don't know what it is,

2274
01:06:49,261 --> 01:06:50,011
but I'm miserable.

2275
01:06:50,011 --> 01:06:51,750
I can't find any happiness in my life.

2276
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:52,321
And,

2277
01:06:52,321 --> 01:06:52,440
uh,

2278
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,370
this is what I'm doing.

2279
01:06:53,371 --> 01:06:54,420
I'm self sabotaging.

2280
01:06:54,421 --> 01:06:55,260
This is what I'm doing wrong.

2281
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:56,310
But when,

2282
01:06:56,310 --> 01:07:00,570
when someone comes to a psychiatrist
or a psychologist and says,

2283
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:01,441
Hey,

2284
01:07:01,441 --> 01:07:01,890
uh,

2285
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:02,400
I'm,

2286
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,210
uh,

2287
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:04,170
I'm the lead singer,

2288
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,910
one of the biggest fucking
bands in the world,

2289
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:07,650
the hottest band in the world.

2290
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:11,130
You show up,

2291
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:11,821
what,

2292
01:07:11,821 --> 01:07:12,960
what are they going to say?

2293
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:13,171
I mean,

2294
01:07:13,171 --> 01:07:13,650
what,

2295
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:14,670
what can they tell you?

2296
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,080
Hey Yo fucking,

2297
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:17,491
I saw that chick,

2298
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:18,540
you with these hot,

2299
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:20,070
you do a great man.

2300
01:07:20,071 --> 01:07:21,090
You are Jesus Christ.

2301
01:07:21,091 --> 01:07:22,320
I drove by your house the other day.

2302
01:07:22,321 --> 01:07:23,071
Holy the shit.

2303
01:07:23,071 --> 01:07:23,970
You live in a castle.

2304
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,860
What are you complaining about?

2305
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:28,020
What do you will wiener
him get Outta here?

2306
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:30,491
Honestly,

2307
01:07:30,491 --> 01:07:31,080
I think the,

2308
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,740
the truth is always the truth.

2309
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,131
And,

2310
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:33,964
and um,

2311
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:40,350
the foundation for an insurance salesman
is no different than the foundation for

2312
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:42,580
any rock star or what have you.

2313
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:43,361
I think,

2314
01:07:43,361 --> 01:07:44,194
um,

2315
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,633
having a,

2316
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,580
a strong sense of self and having a,

2317
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:50,163
a good,

2318
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:53,200
a good sense of what
the world is and isn't.

2319
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,150
I think a lot of times part of
what makes us feel so endowed is,

2320
01:07:58,151 --> 01:07:58,984
um,

2321
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:03,670
our mis conceptions of what other people
are thinking or what other people are

2322
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:04,504
going through.

2323
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:05,141
Again,

2324
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:07,390
it goes back to I'm not normal.

2325
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:10,870
I have all these fears
and doubts and they don't.

2326
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,660
So a lot of times I think,

2327
01:08:13,661 --> 01:08:14,250
um,

2328
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:14,520
we,

2329
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,400
we need to have our,

2330
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:17,234
our,

2331
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:17,750
um,

2332
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:22,400
prospective integrated so
that we understand that
we're not that different than

2333
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:23,001
other people.

2334
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:23,601
And also,

2335
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:24,434
um,

2336
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,240
whatever issues we have,

2337
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:31,420
we get to talk about and somebody's kind
of helps us reflect and points us in

2338
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:32,624
the right direction.

2339
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:33,800
The idea,

2340
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:34,311
look,

2341
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:34,821
I went to the,

2342
01:08:34,821 --> 01:08:38,270
I w I first walked into a therapist
thinking they were going to say,

2343
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:38,870
okay,

2344
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:40,850
here's what you do and you'll be fine.

2345
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,800
And there's none of that.

2346
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,753
It's uh,

2347
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,200
it's mainly,

2348
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:47,570
I call it the best conversation in town.

2349
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:48,463
You just,

2350
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:48,970
you,

2351
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:50,210
you talk and somebody says,

2352
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:50,541
you know,

2353
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:53,450
throw something back at you and
ask you a question about something.

2354
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,610
So it's really you teaching yourself,

2355
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,500
but it's not something
you can do on your own.

2356
01:08:57,501 --> 01:08:58,070
I mean,

2357
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:00,500
you can't read a self help
book and Change Your Life.

2358
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:01,693
I'm sorry.

2359
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:02,563
Really?

2360
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,310
You don't think so except face the music

2361
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,140
that can share,

2362
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,090
that can change your life.

2363
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,210
You don't think that people can read a
self help book and be inspired and may

2364
01:09:12,211 --> 01:09:14,510
think you have changed the
direction even slightly.

2365
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:15,080
Yes.

2366
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,720
And I think that if anything,

2367
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:20,900
it should make you aware that um,

2368
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:25,550
maybe there's someone out there or some
something out there that can take you

2369
01:09:25,551 --> 01:09:26,420
the next step.

2370
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,270
I think a book can open your eyes.

2371
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:31,400
I think a book can inspire you.

2372
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:33,110
Um,

2373
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,093
but I think

2374
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,610
if it's a metaphor for anything else,

2375
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,713
I think we all need,

2376
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:40,040
we all need somebody else.

2377
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:41,450
We don't need somebody else's hand.

2378
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:45,110
So when you were 16 and you first
started going to this guy or Gal,

2379
01:09:45,111 --> 01:09:45,920
whoever it was,

2380
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,710
and you sat down and you
start going over your life,

2381
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:49,880
like what kind of,

2382
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:50,510
how do they,

2383
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:55,510
how do they sort of mold
you into a happier person or
give you the tools to mold

2384
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:57,450
yourself into a happier question?

2385
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,370
Um,

2386
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:00,200
I don't really remember.

2387
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,220
I think it was more,

2388
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,301
like I said before,

2389
01:10:02,301 --> 01:10:03,230
it's just a lifeline,

2390
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:03,980
just,

2391
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,960
just a dialogue.

2392
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,273
Um,

2393
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,140
I don't think,

2394
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:09,800
you know,

2395
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,460
primal,

2396
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,360
primal therapy,

2397
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:13,940
primal scream therapy is a great analogy,

2398
01:10:13,941 --> 01:10:15,050
but I think it's all about,

2399
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,313
um,

2400
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:16,970
purging.

2401
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:21,140
I think it's all about talking and getting
things out and having somebody help

2402
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:25,490
you to understand or
pose questions to you,

2403
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:26,630
you know,

2404
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:27,530
juxtapose.

2405
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,753
Um,

2406
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,920
I think it's really about talking
and talking what Freud called it,

2407
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,130
the talking cure

2408
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:40,100
in talking,

2409
01:10:40,101 --> 01:10:44,660
just the process of going over these
ideas with someone who gives you a

2410
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:46,500
different perspective or gives you a,

2411
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:47,710
you show up every week and,

2412
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:48,680
and it's kind of like,

2413
01:10:48,681 --> 01:10:49,820
what did you do this week?

2414
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:51,430
And you can talk about things and,

2415
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:52,573
and um,

2416
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,980
talk about relationships or what,

2417
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:55,611
you know,

2418
01:10:55,611 --> 01:10:59,690
somebody you're going out with said and
how you responded or what you think.

2419
01:10:59,691 --> 01:11:00,650
And somebody could,

2420
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:01,370
you know,

2421
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:02,570
pose a question or ask you,

2422
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:02,751
well,

2423
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:03,584
do you think,

2424
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:04,460
you know,

2425
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,330
it's really just,

2426
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,890
it's a great conversation where,

2427
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:10,430
where somebody is leading you perhaps,

2428
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,151
you know,

2429
01:11:11,151 --> 01:11:11,411
to,

2430
01:11:11,411 --> 01:11:13,950
to look at things a little
differently and maybe,

2431
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,980
maybe a changes the wiring
over a period of time.

2432
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:17,641
Well,

2433
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:21,450
I got to imagine that the wiring gets
screwed up because of negative input.

2434
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,210
Totally.

2435
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:22,601
Totally.

2436
01:11:22,601 --> 01:11:23,170
So,

2437
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:24,670
so it's almost like,

2438
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:27,370
I really believe in my case,

2439
01:11:27,371 --> 01:11:28,204
in a lot of peoples,

2440
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:30,550
it's like learning to walk again.

2441
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:32,950
You can't run before you walk.

2442
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,850
You can't get on with your life
until the basics are in place.

2443
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,990
And if the basics were,

2444
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40,130
um,

2445
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:43,330
miss constructed when you were a child,

2446
01:11:43,331 --> 01:11:43,841
an infant,

2447
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:44,381
a toddler,

2448
01:11:44,381 --> 01:11:45,214
whatever,

2449
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:47,110
then you can never build a structure.

2450
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:50,740
You've got to go back down and rebuild.

2451
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,600
So I think that's,

2452
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,430
I think that's what therapy does,

2453
01:11:54,431 --> 01:11:54,900
is it,

2454
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:55,510
it,

2455
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:56,800
it doesn't,

2456
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:58,500
it may deal with the,

2457
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:01,480
what is going on in the depression,

2458
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:06,190
but ultimately it's got to get to the
core because you can't change things

2459
01:12:06,191 --> 01:12:11,191
unless you change the wiring that I'm
the most simplistic wiring is what's

2460
01:12:12,701 --> 01:12:14,170
responsible for what comes later.

2461
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:15,310
Wow,

2462
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:17,530
that's a welcome to psychology today.

2463
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,540
It's as important to talk about man,

2464
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:23,690
to say it's very rare that someone ever
gets a chance to hear a guy like you

2465
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:26,450
discuss this stuff so openly and bravely.

2466
01:12:26,451 --> 01:12:27,284
And honestly,

2467
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:27,871
I don't think,

2468
01:12:27,871 --> 01:12:28,340
you know,

2469
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:29,071
interestingly,

2470
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:30,480
I don't think it's brave.

2471
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:31,863
Um,

2472
01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:35,211
you know,

2473
01:12:35,211 --> 01:12:35,391
I,

2474
01:12:35,391 --> 01:12:37,220
I don't think it's brave because

2475
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,590
the people who don't talk about it,

2476
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:42,424
okay.

2477
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:46,060
Haven't come to terms with it and,

2478
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:47,400
and maybe having

2479
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:50,650
rewired fix themselves,

2480
01:12:50,651 --> 01:12:52,420
come to grips with things in their life.

2481
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:53,231
To me,

2482
01:12:53,231 --> 01:12:53,561
it's,

2483
01:12:53,561 --> 01:12:54,394
it's just,

2484
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:59,350
it's reality and there's no
vulnerability attached to it.

2485
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:01,450
I think when you're
still in the midst of it,

2486
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:05,860
you don't want to divulge certain things
because it's not only inappropriate,

2487
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,770
but it can come back
to be used against you.

2488
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:13,750
Once you start sharing
your vulnerabilities and
you're still vulnerable,

2489
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,400
then people can use them.

2490
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,500
I'm really talking about the past.

2491
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:18,793
Um,

2492
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:20,871
and that,

2493
01:13:20,871 --> 01:13:21,370
that's,

2494
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:25,520
that's safe and actually in some
ways probably Cathartic therapeutic,

2495
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,280
but for somebody to,

2496
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:27,870
to,

2497
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,560
it would be inappropriate for
somebody who's got certain

2498
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:33,103
problems,

2499
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:34,100
neuroses,

2500
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,480
whatever you want to call them,

2501
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:39,290
for them to divulge them and then
have somebody use them against them.

2502
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,290
I'm not in that position anymore.

2503
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:41,900
I'm,

2504
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:42,770
I'm talking about,

2505
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:47,600
I'm talking about a journey that
got me to this place in my life now,

2506
01:13:47,601 --> 01:13:48,434
which is a,

2507
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,400
a great place.

2508
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,630
And I always felt that if
somebody uses them against you,

2509
01:13:52,631 --> 01:13:54,430
if you share something with
someone to use it against you,

2510
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,990
then you know what kind of person that is.

2511
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:56,390
Right.

2512
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,150
But that's a tough lesson
to learn it and you know,

2513
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:00,940
and why put yourself in that position,

2514
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:01,860
you know?

2515
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:02,530
Yeah.

2516
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:03,363
Without a doubt.

2517
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:03,760
Um,

2518
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,090
when,

2519
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:06,850
when you started taking
off and you realize like,

2520
01:14:06,851 --> 01:14:07,211
okay,

2521
01:14:07,211 --> 01:14:08,021
this is all,

2522
01:14:08,021 --> 01:14:08,854
we're on the rollercoaster,

2523
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:09,221
click,

2524
01:14:09,221 --> 01:14:09,431
click,

2525
01:14:09,431 --> 01:14:09,671
click,

2526
01:14:09,671 --> 01:14:09,941
click,

2527
01:14:09,941 --> 01:14:10,480
click.

2528
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,130
Did you start a psychiatrist

2529
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:12,491
on the road?

2530
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:12,890
Oh God,

2531
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:13,270
no,

2532
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:13,511
no,

2533
01:14:13,511 --> 01:14:13,990
no.

2534
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:15,310
So how long would you go on the road for?

2535
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,010
I was almost always on the road,

2536
01:14:18,011 --> 01:14:19,750
so if I was on the road,

2537
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:20,643
um,

2538
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,600
maybe once a week I would,

2539
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:23,620
I make a phone call.

2540
01:14:23,621 --> 01:14:24,790
I heard somebody saying,

2541
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:24,971
you know,

2542
01:14:24,971 --> 01:14:26,120
I was on the phone every day,

2543
01:14:26,121 --> 01:14:26,710
or,

2544
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:27,790
but then again,

2545
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:28,624
that person

2546
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,690
doesn't remember what they did yesterday,

2547
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:32,321
but,

2548
01:14:32,321 --> 01:14:33,154
um,

2549
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:33,701
no,

2550
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:34,130
I mean,

2551
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:34,850
it,

2552
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:35,683
it,

2553
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:38,440
it doesn't need to consume you.

2554
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:40,810
And a therapist is in a span,

2555
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:41,291
golly,

2556
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:42,220
they're not going to,

2557
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:43,780
they're not a puppet master,

2558
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:48,310
but in an inappropriate time in your life,

2559
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:51,190
go as often as you feel you need to.

2560
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:54,910
The issue would be if you
did that your whole life,

2561
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:58,570
that would probably say to me that you're
not making a whole lot of progress.

2562
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:02,530
And I would say a therapist is
no different than anyone else.

2563
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:03,363
Um,

2564
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:03,731
you know,

2565
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:04,564
there's great,

2566
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:07,690
there's brain surgeons is neurosurgeons
and then there's brilliant

2567
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:08,471
neurosurgeons.

2568
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:08,980
And,

2569
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:09,813
um,

2570
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:10,691
but then again,

2571
01:15:10,691 --> 01:15:12,610
it's also a matter of what works with you.

2572
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:13,360
Um,

2573
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,700
if you have some sort of synchronicity,

2574
01:15:15,701 --> 01:15:16,570
simpatico,

2575
01:15:16,571 --> 01:15:17,590
whatever you want to call it,

2576
01:15:17,591 --> 01:15:18,424
with the,

2577
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:19,450
with somebody,

2578
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:19,781
you'll,

2579
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:20,770
you'll get much farther.

2580
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:22,900
And if you don't find
yourself getting somewhere,

2581
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,120
then maybe you need to move on.

2582
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:30,220
I had a very biased idea of therapy
when I was younger because I worked with

2583
01:15:30,221 --> 01:15:33,670
actors and there were so self indulgent
when they were talking about the

2584
01:15:33,671 --> 01:15:34,031
therapy.

2585
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:34,361
I'm like,

2586
01:15:34,361 --> 01:15:37,300
this is just giving you another fucking
opportunity to talk about yourself.

2587
01:15:37,301 --> 01:15:37,981
That's what this well,

2588
01:15:37,981 --> 01:15:38,410
yeah,

2589
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:39,490
actors are very funny.

2590
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:40,430
And um,

2591
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:42,390
um,

2592
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:42,970
um,

2593
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:47,680
I have to say that at one point in my
life I decided that musicians were just,

2594
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:49,690
a lot of them are very,

2595
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:51,160
very narrow in,

2596
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:51,551
in,

2597
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:52,211
in their,

2598
01:15:52,211 --> 01:15:53,044
um,

2599
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:54,503
um,

2600
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,050
pursuits outside of music.

2601
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,100
And I found that really,

2602
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:01,020
really boring to get together and old
somebody wants to talk about is like

2603
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,230
guitars or something.

2604
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,280
So I said,

2605
01:16:03,281 --> 01:16:04,960
I'm going to hang out with actors.

2606
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,640
And I started hanging out.

2607
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:07,380
Uh,

2608
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:08,550
a friend of mine owned a,

2609
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,170
a bar in New York and I,

2610
01:16:11,171 --> 01:16:12,004
uh,

2611
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:15,670
was there every night and became
friends with a whole lot of people.

2612
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:16,241
And I found out,

2613
01:16:16,241 --> 01:16:17,074
my gosh,

2614
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:22,170
these people only want to listen to me
talk so they get their turn and they just

2615
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:23,650
wanted to talk about themselves.

2616
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:24,573
And uh,

2617
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:26,351
that's not,

2618
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:27,940
that's not a generalization.

2619
01:16:27,941 --> 01:16:29,470
That's just my experience with,

2620
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:31,630
cause I don't want everybody
calling me up and saying,

2621
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:32,500
you know,

2622
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,460
you talking about me.

2623
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:33,731
No,

2624
01:16:33,731 --> 01:16:34,690
I'm not talking about you.

2625
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:35,524
But there were,

2626
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,660
there are certainly a lot of people in,

2627
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:38,210
uh,

2628
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:38,780
the,

2629
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:43,390
the performance field who
love the spotlight and,

2630
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:43,900
um,

2631
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:47,830
tolerate use speaking so
that they get their chance.

2632
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:48,521
Yeah.

2633
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,920
Going from musicians to actors,

2634
01:16:50,921 --> 01:16:54,700
looking for depth is like
going from a pool to the ocean,

2635
01:16:54,701 --> 01:16:55,930
looking for wet or water.

2636
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:56,883
Yeah.

2637
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:58,590
I,

2638
01:16:58,590 --> 01:16:58,781
you know,

2639
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:00,100
I remember going to,

2640
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:00,934
um,

2641
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,520
going to a party at,

2642
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:02,741
at,

2643
01:17:02,741 --> 01:17:03,574
um,

2644
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:06,730
Lee Strasburg's house,

2645
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:09,920
who's arguably like the,

2646
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:10,754
the,

2647
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:11,151
you know,

2648
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:11,801
one of the,

2649
01:17:11,801 --> 01:17:13,850
the gurus of,

2650
01:17:13,851 --> 01:17:14,684
um,

2651
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:18,890
of method acting and all the famous
people were there and we were all in the

2652
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:21,560
living room and they all seem so unhappy.

2653
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:22,220
Oh.

2654
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,320
And it's like I was thinking,

2655
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:26,390
I want to create from joy.

2656
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:28,190
I don't want to create from misery.

2657
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:29,780
And you know,

2658
01:17:29,781 --> 01:17:30,614
it's like every,

2659
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:33,740
I wanted to have an umbrella and I wanted
an umbrella because it seemed to be

2660
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:34,730
reigning in this place.

2661
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:39,940
But I know certainly there were a lot
of people in different fields of the art

2662
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:45,521
who feel that their creativity is
based on there being unhappy or,

2663
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:46,813
or they're,

2664
01:17:46,990 --> 01:17:47,300
you know,

2665
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,133
discontent.

2666
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:51,740
I don't want to paint from there.

2667
01:17:51,741 --> 01:17:53,450
I don't want to sing from there.

2668
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:54,380
I think it's a trap.

2669
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:55,071
W We,

2670
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,620
we experienced the same
thing with standup comedians.

2671
01:17:57,621 --> 01:18:01,610
A lot of standup comedians almost believe
that you have to be miserable outside

2672
01:18:01,611 --> 01:18:06,350
of being on stage in order to create and
that your reward for being miserable is

2673
01:18:06,351 --> 01:18:07,340
dead when you're killing.

2674
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:09,200
When you're on stage and
everybody dying laughing,

2675
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:09,981
this is,

2676
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:12,680
this is what you get to experience
that other people don't,

2677
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:14,470
so that when you're not doing this you,

2678
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,530
you're a miserable fuck.

2679
01:18:15,531 --> 01:18:17,870
You're supposed to be
running around frumpy a,

2680
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:19,040
you know better than I do,

2681
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:22,700
but I've certainly met my
share of miserable comedians.

2682
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:23,600
I've met a lot.

2683
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,380
I'm better.

2684
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,970
I think that's changing a bit.

2685
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:29,300
People are becoming more aware
of the fact that there is no,

2686
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:34,100
there's no individual singular
path to any creative endeavor.

2687
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,560
Whether it's music or
whether it's a painting.

2688
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:40,160
He is a lot of different ways to do
it and you could be really good at it

2689
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,270
without being miserable.

2690
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:41,511
Yeah,

2691
01:18:41,511 --> 01:18:41,711
there,

2692
01:18:41,711 --> 01:18:46,250
there were people and I
certainly experienced people
who are afraid to be happy

2693
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,900
because it will affect their
creativity and I got to tell you,

2694
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:51,973
you know,

2695
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:52,831
happiness is,

2696
01:18:52,831 --> 01:18:53,810
is probably the,

2697
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:58,190
the best additive to creativity.

2698
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:59,241
When I was young,

2699
01:18:59,241 --> 01:18:59,560
I,

2700
01:18:59,560 --> 01:18:59,830
I,

2701
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:02,690
this is how stupid I was when I
first started doing standup comedy.

2702
01:19:02,691 --> 01:19:05,570
I actually stopped meditating
because I was worried.

2703
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:06,351
I was like,

2704
01:19:06,351 --> 01:19:10,100
if I become too calm and if I
achieve any sort of enlightenment,

2705
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,140
this will fuck up my subject matter.

2706
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:13,850
Because part of being a standup comedian,

2707
01:19:13,851 --> 01:19:17,810
it's about kind of being rude or
at least being shocking in a way.

2708
01:19:17,811 --> 01:19:19,580
At least I thought that I was like,

2709
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:21,260
I can't be meditating.

2710
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,580
I can't be going to yoga.

2711
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:24,530
I gotta I gotta get this out of my head.

2712
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:24,670
Yeah.

2713
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:25,850
But that,

2714
01:19:25,851 --> 01:19:27,280
that sharpness and,

2715
01:19:27,281 --> 01:19:31,580
and peace of mind and contentment
that can come from yoga therapy,

2716
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:32,271
you know,

2717
01:19:32,271 --> 01:19:33,260
a happy home life,

2718
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:37,310
whatever is something that
can really enhance your,

2719
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:38,001
you know,

2720
01:19:38,001 --> 01:19:39,680
whatever your creative outlet is.

2721
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:40,573
And uh,

2722
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:45,650
it's just always interesting to see
people who were afraid to be happy.

2723
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:46,131
Yeah.

2724
01:19:46,131 --> 01:19:46,880
There's many,

2725
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,340
there's many engines of motivation.

2726
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:51,740
They don't always necessarily
have to be negative.

2727
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:56,090
And that's why I was curious about your
approach because you were coming from

2728
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,350
this place of,

2729
01:19:57,351 --> 01:19:57,770
uh,

2730
01:19:57,770 --> 01:19:58,970
of negativity,

2731
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:03,150
but you figured out how to
channel it into applause.

2732
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,040
I suspect it,

2733
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,660
but what was I singing about?

2734
01:20:05,661 --> 01:20:08,070
I was seeing about getting laid.

2735
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:11,880
I was singing about partying
and that was was terrific.

2736
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:12,780
Um,

2737
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:15,170
what was lacking was some of the,

2738
01:20:15,171 --> 01:20:15,780
the,

2739
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,070
the other,

2740
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:18,443
um,

2741
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,010
inner skills.

2742
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:20,581
But,

2743
01:20:20,581 --> 01:20:21,414
um,

2744
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:21,750
I,

2745
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:22,620
I sang,

2746
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:26,550
I sang about nobody was interested in me.

2747
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:28,770
What do you want to hear songs
about me being miserable?

2748
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:31,170
I would have the day,

2749
01:20:31,171 --> 01:20:32,000
man.

2750
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,440
I was having a grand old time and uh,

2751
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:35,521
reveling in,

2752
01:20:35,521 --> 01:20:35,911
in,

2753
01:20:35,911 --> 01:20:36,744
uh,

2754
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:37,980
in everything I had.

2755
01:20:37,981 --> 01:20:38,610
You know,

2756
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:41,970
I grew up wanting a playboy playmate,

2757
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:42,630
you know,

2758
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:43,463
I wanted,

2759
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:45,001
I got all,

2760
01:20:45,001 --> 01:20:45,241
you know,

2761
01:20:45,241 --> 01:20:46,290
I got all that stuff.

2762
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:46,890
It was,

2763
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:47,820
and it was terrific.

2764
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:51,990
The great thing about having things is
it gives you a chance to see whether you

2765
01:20:51,991 --> 01:20:52,824
really want it,

2766
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,353
you know,

2767
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:55,380
and that that's,

2768
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:56,220
that's pretty cool.

2769
01:20:56,221 --> 01:20:57,510
People spend their lives,

2770
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:58,440
um,

2771
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,480
sometimes chasing things
that they never get.

2772
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:01,710
I've been very fortunate.

2773
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:05,400
I've pretty much gotten everything
I chased and some of it,

2774
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,440
it was all worth having,

2775
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,510
but it wasn't all worth keeping.

2776
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:14,070
So what you thought it would
be before you got there?

2777
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:14,910
Why do I,

2778
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:19,020
sometimes I thought that certain things
would be the solution and all the white

2779
01:21:19,021 --> 01:21:19,770
playmate.

2780
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:20,151
Yeah.

2781
01:21:20,151 --> 01:21:22,110
I mean it wasn't for Thursday,

2782
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:22,980
it was a solution.

2783
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:24,683
Um,

2784
01:21:25,410 --> 01:21:25,741
but,

2785
01:21:25,741 --> 01:21:26,400
um,

2786
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:26,701
you know,

2787
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:27,181
look a,

2788
01:21:27,181 --> 01:21:28,020
again,

2789
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:30,780
my life's been awesome,

2790
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:31,770
awesome.

2791
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:32,161
And,

2792
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:32,994
um,

2793
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:34,740
it got me to here and,

2794
01:21:34,741 --> 01:21:35,574
uh,

2795
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:36,290
you know,

2796
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:37,710
when you hear poor me,

2797
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:37,910
you know,

2798
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:38,970
when you hear people talking,

2799
01:21:38,971 --> 01:21:39,391
poor me,

2800
01:21:39,391 --> 01:21:41,280
it's a lonely and you know,

2801
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,070
my life's been great.

2802
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:45,090
Um,

2803
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:46,890
and it's all led me to where I am now.

2804
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:47,431
And,

2805
01:21:47,431 --> 01:21:48,264
uh,

2806
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,520
I,

2807
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,960
I have nothing but great
memories and no regrets.

2808
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,000
So you don't have to go
to therapy at all anymore.

2809
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:54,863
You don't do any of that.

2810
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:55,440
I go,

2811
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,910
I go sometimes once,

2812
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:57,600
I,

2813
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,141
if I can,

2814
01:21:58,141 --> 01:21:59,010
I go once a week,

2815
01:21:59,310 --> 01:21:59,940
once a week.

2816
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:00,300
Yeah.

2817
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,680
As I said to me,

2818
01:22:01,870 --> 01:22:03,670
it's not laying on a couch and,

2819
01:22:03,671 --> 01:22:04,620
and you know,

2820
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:05,341
trying to,

2821
01:22:05,341 --> 01:22:06,510
trying to figure out,

2822
01:22:06,511 --> 01:22:07,344
uh,

2823
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:07,710
you know,

2824
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:08,543
minutia.

2825
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:09,960
It's really a great,

2826
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:11,820
if you have a great therapist,

2827
01:22:11,821 --> 01:22:12,810
it's great conversation.

2828
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:13,793
Literally,

2829
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:14,310
Hey,

2830
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,143
here's what I did.

2831
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:16,770
I did this this week and,

2832
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:17,933
you know,

2833
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:19,381
it's,

2834
01:22:19,381 --> 01:22:19,860
um,

2835
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:20,940
I call it life school.

2836
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:22,140
It's just kind of,

2837
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,273
you know,

2838
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:25,990
I don't expect somebody else to,

2839
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,910
to be able to tell me what,

2840
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,100
what the answer is.

2841
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:31,440
They probably don't have
the answer for them.

2842
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:32,520
You know,

2843
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:33,030
when,

2844
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:35,640
when we put therapists or doctors,

2845
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:39,270
when we put anybody on a pedestal
where we're on dangerous ground,

2846
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:40,620
these are just people,

2847
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:42,000
they have their own issues.

2848
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:44,760
They may be great at helping you,

2849
01:22:44,761 --> 01:22:47,760
but it doesn't mean that they
have the answer for them.

2850
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:48,511
We're all,

2851
01:22:48,511 --> 01:22:51,720
we're all out there trying
to figure it out them to,

2852
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:53,310
yeah.

2853
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:55,350
Even like the Dalai Lama,

2854
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:59,310
the Dalai Lama doesn't have
sex and he only wears orange.

2855
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,073
Okay.

2856
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,140
Does they have a swollen hand or anything?

2857
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:04,710
Nope.

2858
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:05,140
No.

2859
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:05,500
Nope.

2860
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,040
He believes it's

2861
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,740
too complicated that simplify it.

2862
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:11,290
Oh,

2863
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:11,810
come up.

2864
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:12,430
Yeah.

2865
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:14,170
It's much simpler than he thinks.

2866
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:15,100
That's the problem.

2867
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:15,800
Yeah.

2868
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:19,870
I've always found issues with people
that choose this monastic lifestyle.

2869
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:21,250
Seeing that that's like the most,

2870
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:21,810
the,

2871
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:23,380
the most simple path,

2872
01:23:23,381 --> 01:23:27,160
but you're missing out on some of the
most beautiful joys of life because you

2873
01:23:27,161 --> 01:23:31,810
believe that you can't
handle relationships or he
can't handle being a father,

2874
01:23:31,811 --> 01:23:36,210
or you can't handle the pursuit of
art or whatever you're doing what,

2875
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,313
you know,

2876
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:38,770
to take the other side of the coin.

2877
01:23:38,771 --> 01:23:41,230
Maybe they're right about them,

2878
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:41,891
you know,

2879
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:43,480
it's like when somebody says,

2880
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:43,931
wow,

2881
01:23:43,931 --> 01:23:44,500
you know,

2882
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,540
so and so's missing out
by not having children.

2883
01:23:46,541 --> 01:23:46,721
I go,

2884
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:47,554
not really,

2885
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,590
because chances are they wouldn't get
out of it what you're getting out of it.

2886
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:51,960
Right.

2887
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:52,793
So,

2888
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,040
you know,

2889
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,200
it's very easy to project.

2890
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:57,460
Um,

2891
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:57,920
and it,

2892
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:58,680
it's,

2893
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,740
it's called transference.

2894
01:23:59,740 --> 01:23:59,861
You know,

2895
01:23:59,861 --> 01:24:00,850
it's very easy to,

2896
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:04,990
to imagine your feelings on somebody
else or your life on somebody else.

2897
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:06,123
And it doesn't always,

2898
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:07,270
it doesn't always go that way.

2899
01:24:07,271 --> 01:24:07,890
So,

2900
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:08,723
um,

2901
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:11,530
if the Dalai Lama or
anybody else's is happy,

2902
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:12,311
you know,

2903
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:14,680
leading some sort of monastic life or,

2904
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:16,750
or being celibate or whatever,

2905
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:18,880
he thinks he's happy,

2906
01:24:18,881 --> 01:24:19,601
he's never been one of them.

2907
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:24,601
Paul Stanley orgies covers gigantic
heart shaped beds and he got 50 tens

2908
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:26,043
swarming Ya.

2909
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,330
He doesn't know that.

2910
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,280
It's hard.

2911
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:29,530
Yeah.

2912
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:30,363
I had to be you.

2913
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:31,750
He doesn't know what the
fuck he's talking about.

2914
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,141
Yeah.

2915
01:24:32,141 --> 01:24:32,221
I,

2916
01:24:32,221 --> 01:24:36,250
I've always been very conscious about
not projecting that to other people when

2917
01:24:36,251 --> 01:24:41,110
it comes to like how much children has
changed me that you need to do it because

2918
01:24:41,111 --> 01:24:41,181
I,

2919
01:24:41,181 --> 01:24:44,320
I used to resent that when I was
single and people talk to me about,

2920
01:24:44,321 --> 01:24:44,561
Oh,

2921
01:24:44,561 --> 01:24:45,880
you need to get married and have kids,

2922
01:24:45,881 --> 01:24:47,020
but get the fuck outta here.

2923
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:47,460
Like,

2924
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:47,960
Oh man,

2925
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:48,521
kids change.

2926
01:24:48,521 --> 01:24:49,510
I'm better because of kids.

2927
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:49,990
Yeah.

2928
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:51,400
You need to have kids and
your life and be like,

2929
01:24:51,401 --> 01:24:52,300
you need to fuck off.

2930
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:52,630
You know,

2931
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:52,960
like,

2932
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,520
I hate proselytizing.

2933
01:24:54,521 --> 01:24:55,660
So when people would do that,

2934
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:57,190
I'm very conscious.

2935
01:24:57,191 --> 01:24:59,830
There's nothing worse than a
riff then a reformed hooker,

2936
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,033
you know,

2937
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:03,640
or reformed alcoholic.

2938
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:03,971
Yeah.

2939
01:25:03,971 --> 01:25:04,331
You know,

2940
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:06,940
those people are brutal
to go about your life and,

2941
01:25:06,941 --> 01:25:07,301
and,

2942
01:25:07,301 --> 01:25:11,740
and understand and realize that everybody
has their own path and that will work

2943
01:25:11,741 --> 01:25:16,090
for you and is working for you may have
absolutely no relevance to their life

2944
01:25:16,091 --> 01:25:16,924
whatsoever.

2945
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:17,351
You know,

2946
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:18,790
somebody a couple of days
ago was saying to me,

2947
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:19,420
you know,

2948
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:20,050
against,

2949
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:23,260
oh so and so's there really when
I see people that don't have kids,

2950
01:25:23,261 --> 01:25:24,420
I really think they are missing out.

2951
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:25,030
I go,

2952
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:28,840
they may be missing out on nothing because
they're not equipped to have kids or

2953
01:25:28,841 --> 01:25:31,600
they wouldn't get what you're getting
out of it or what you're getting out of

2954
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:33,220
your relationship or your marriage.

2955
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:34,203
Some people,

2956
01:25:34,910 --> 01:25:35,320
you know,

2957
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:38,200
everybody just needs to
find their own contentment,

2958
01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:43,201
whether it's in an orange robe or a
underneath an orange robe with a blonde.

2959
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:47,890
I just think it's hard for some folks
to balance that perspective to say,

2960
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:48,490
you know,

2961
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:51,130
they think of how much they love their
children and how much they love their

2962
01:25:51,131 --> 01:25:51,491
family.

2963
01:25:51,491 --> 01:25:53,050
They couldn't imagine being without it.

2964
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,040
So they see someone,

2965
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:54,221
they said,

2966
01:25:54,221 --> 01:25:56,800
well you can't possibly be happy
because you're not living my life.

2967
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:59,500
Well it goes a step further.

2968
01:25:59,501 --> 01:26:00,251
I always say to people,

2969
01:26:00,251 --> 01:26:00,970
look,

2970
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:04,460
never think that when somebody tells
you something means the same thing as if

2971
01:26:04,461 --> 01:26:05,294
you said it.

2972
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:06,830
If somebody says I love you,

2973
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:10,880
don't for a minute think that they
define love the same way you do.

2974
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:11,930
You need to say,

2975
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:12,973
what do you mean?

2976
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,380
Because somebody will do
something and you'll go,

2977
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,460
I thought you loved me.

2978
01:26:16,461 --> 01:26:16,760
And they go,

2979
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:17,593
I do love you.

2980
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:23,250
So you know the I love means
I'm allowed to steal from you.

2981
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:24,621
Exactly.

2982
01:26:24,621 --> 01:26:25,190
You know,

2983
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:26,023
file sharing.

2984
01:26:27,370 --> 01:26:28,203
Um,

2985
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:29,203
cause it's all,

2986
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,320
it's all digital.

2987
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,640
It's all zeros.

2988
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:32,361
No,

2989
01:26:32,361 --> 01:26:33,950
but it's so easy to,

2990
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:34,430
to,

2991
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:35,263
to,

2992
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:39,590
in relationships you'll hear somebody
say something and you just take for

2993
01:26:39,591 --> 01:26:39,980
granted.

2994
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:42,890
Oh they mean they can mean
something totally different.

2995
01:26:42,891 --> 01:26:46,270
So it's always a always important
to say to somebody what,

2996
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:46,881
what do you mean?

2997
01:26:46,881 --> 01:26:47,990
What does that mean to you?

2998
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:48,750
Yeah.

2999
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:49,910
The context of words,

3000
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:50,120
you know,

3001
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,260
just words by themselves,

3002
01:26:51,261 --> 01:26:51,441
you know,

3003
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:52,250
you really need,

3004
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:55,490
and also everyone has their own sort
of internal definitions of things like

3005
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:56,030
you've,

3006
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:59,150
you have to kind of establish that when
you get to know people and figure out

3007
01:26:59,151 --> 01:27:00,740
whether or not you really
want them in your life.

3008
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:05,570
Oh my life became so much simpler
when I cut most people out of it.

3009
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:06,830
I really,

3010
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:07,340
truly,

3011
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:09,290
and I recommend it for everybody.

3012
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:10,220
Toxic people.

3013
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:11,083
There was nobody.

3014
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:11,541
Yeah.

3015
01:27:11,541 --> 01:27:15,890
Nobody in my life that is
there because I feel obligated.

3016
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:19,790
Nobody's there because I have to have
a business relationship with them.

3017
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:22,760
There's nobody around me that
I can't look in the eye and go,

3018
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:24,320
I want to be here.

3019
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:27,380
So once you cut all that stuff out,

3020
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,970
life becomes much,

3021
01:27:28,971 --> 01:27:29,804
much easier,

3022
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:30,793
you know?

3023
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:31,670
Yeah.

3024
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:33,680
And if someone cuts you out,

3025
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,540
maybe you need to step back and go,

3026
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:35,811
hey,

3027
01:27:35,811 --> 01:27:36,111
what's the,

3028
01:27:36,111 --> 01:27:36,470
what did I,

3029
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:36,560
oh,

3030
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,520
maybe I'm a Douche.

3031
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,470
Maybe we need to look at
myself a little bit better.

3032
01:27:39,471 --> 01:27:39,751
This guy,

3033
01:27:39,751 --> 01:27:41,060
I decided I was toxic.

3034
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:42,853
Bam.

3035
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:43,930
You know?

3036
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:44,763
Um,

3037
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:47,450
and it's also great to be
with somebody who you respect,

3038
01:27:47,451 --> 01:27:49,430
who can tell you when
you're being an idiot,

3039
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:50,300
you know,

3040
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:51,133
huge.

3041
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:52,091
You know,

3042
01:27:52,091 --> 01:27:52,970
to be able to take the heads.

3043
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:53,690
Yeah.

3044
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:54,523
Yeah.

3045
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,480
They are the greatest advances
often come from the lowest lows.

3046
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:00,920
Like to to realize like,

3047
01:28:00,921 --> 01:28:01,131
oh,

3048
01:28:01,131 --> 01:28:01,964
okay,

3049
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:03,740
this is a complete failure.

3050
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,490
Let's put the pieces back together again
and figure out why I failed and then

3051
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:08,324
move forward.

3052
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:12,380
You can't really relate to that as being
a rock star when you were 21 person

3053
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:16,340
succeeds is the one who
continued after they failed.

3054
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:16,940
Yes.

3055
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:17,600
You know,

3056
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,433
and uh,

3057
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:19,520
and maybe adjustments.

3058
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:19,850
Yeah.

3059
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:24,850
Everybody has dealt with failure and the
person who fails ultimately is the one

3060
01:28:25,131 --> 01:28:26,660
who didn't continue on.

3061
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:26,931
Well,

3062
01:28:26,931 --> 01:28:31,580
that's why it's so a fascinating to me
and admirable that you were able to make

3063
01:28:31,581 --> 01:28:33,530
these adjustments very early on.

3064
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:39,920
I certainly started early on and perhaps
if I had known how long would it take

3065
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:40,581
to,

3066
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:42,020
to see those adjustments,

3067
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:42,590
uh,

3068
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:44,300
come to some sort of fruition?

3069
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,220
Maybe I would have thought twice about it.

3070
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:46,521
But,

3071
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:47,354
um,

3072
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:48,981
you know,

3073
01:28:48,981 --> 01:28:50,960
it goes back to you can't kid yourself.

3074
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:53,180
You can get everybody else
around you and you can say,

3075
01:28:53,181 --> 01:28:53,721
I'm okay.

3076
01:28:53,721 --> 01:28:54,531
And you know,

3077
01:28:54,531 --> 01:28:57,020
you can convince people that
your grade or whatever you want,

3078
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:58,040
but you know the truth

3079
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:00,710
and you have to live with it.

3080
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:02,010
So how did you

3081
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,060
make the transition?

3082
01:29:03,061 --> 01:29:03,420
Like you,

3083
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:04,980
you were obviously a very content,

3084
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:06,030
very happy person.

3085
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:10,980
Now how long did it take while this
rockstar roller coaster ride was going on

3086
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:12,960
before you really felt
comfortable with it all?

3087
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:14,723
Um,

3088
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:18,390
well,

3089
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:18,521
I,

3090
01:29:18,521 --> 01:29:23,160
I was married before and
perhaps what marriage,

3091
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:24,870
like a bad marriage can teach you.

3092
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:25,980
Like anything else in life,

3093
01:29:25,981 --> 01:29:27,360
it can teach you what you don't want,

3094
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:28,471
you know?

3095
01:29:28,471 --> 01:29:28,861
And,

3096
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:29,580
uh,

3097
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:30,120
um,

3098
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:35,120
I needed to go through a marriage that
wasn't great and got a great son out of

3099
01:29:36,751 --> 01:29:37,201
it and,

3100
01:29:37,201 --> 01:29:38,034
um,

3101
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,930
just continued on the path.

3102
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:42,930
It's kind of like getting
off the wrong exit.

3103
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:44,543
You know,

3104
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:46,590
I saw some,

3105
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:51,150
I saw some very interesting scenery
and then I got back on the freeway.

3106
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:51,871
But,

3107
01:29:51,871 --> 01:29:52,704
um,

3108
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:54,330
it's been an,

3109
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:59,010
it's been an ongoing path
and I'd say the last 15,

3110
01:29:59,011 --> 01:30:00,990
20 years have been like,

3111
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:05,210
just better and better
and better as I look.

3112
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:06,070
I,

3113
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:06,660
I met White,

3114
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:07,920
my wife that I'm,

3115
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:08,821
I'm with now,

3116
01:30:08,821 --> 01:30:13,690
I met Erin 13 years ago
and without hesitation,

3117
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:15,270
the best 13 years of my life,

3118
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:16,000
you know,

3119
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:16,351
just,

3120
01:30:16,351 --> 01:30:17,184
uh,

3121
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:18,180
just incredible.

3122
01:30:18,181 --> 01:30:20,940
I didn't even know a
relationship like this existed.

3123
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:22,633
Wow.

3124
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:23,340
Yeah.

3125
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:24,173
That's amazing.

3126
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:25,913
That's a,

3127
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,270
that is really the key,

3128
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:27,661
isn't it?

3129
01:30:27,661 --> 01:30:30,450
It's like finding someone
who you're compatible with,

3130
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,130
finding someone who,

3131
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,170
you know,

3132
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:34,003
it just,

3133
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:34,980
just fits.

3134
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:36,810
So may gets thrown around so much

3135
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:37,990
Chyna and it's a,

3136
01:30:37,991 --> 01:30:40,120
it's a term that's so abused by,

3137
01:30:40,121 --> 01:30:41,950
I certainly use it in the past,

3138
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:44,140
but when you get it right,

3139
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:45,640
it's pretty,

3140
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,320
pretty amazing stuff.

3141
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:48,183
I mean,

3142
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:48,701
the,

3143
01:30:48,701 --> 01:30:49,534
the,

3144
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,620
the peace of mind and the
contentment that you have,

3145
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:57,520
being with the right person is incredible.

3146
01:30:57,550 --> 01:30:58,383
I mean,

3147
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:00,370
I know beyond any doubt,

3148
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:02,360
this is where I'll be
poor the rest of my life,

3149
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:03,933
you know,

3150
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:05,920
I hope hers too,

3151
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:06,790
you know?

3152
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:08,200
But I I know from,

3153
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:09,130
from where I'm at,

3154
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,080
you know,

3155
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:10,360
I,

3156
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:13,090
I've got four amazing kids and,

3157
01:31:13,091 --> 01:31:13,671
and uh,

3158
01:31:13,671 --> 01:31:16,630
an incredible wife and everything else is

3159
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:19,660
icing on the cake,

3160
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:23,120
the rollercoaster ride of doing,

3161
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:23,841
you know,

3162
01:31:23,841 --> 01:31:27,680
being in a rock and roll band and
being is some international superstars.

3163
01:31:27,681 --> 01:31:30,590
Got To make it very difficult to keep a
relationship too because you're always

3164
01:31:30,591 --> 01:31:32,210
focused on so many different things.

3165
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:34,110
You've got the songs putting together,

3166
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:35,720
dealing with the inner complications,

3167
01:31:35,721 --> 01:31:36,680
have been in the band,

3168
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:37,880
you're touring,

3169
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:39,290
you're putting out albums,

3170
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,270
a lot of pressure and stress as well,

3171
01:31:41,271 --> 01:31:41,570
right?

3172
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:41,691
Yeah.

3173
01:31:41,691 --> 01:31:42,800
But when you,

3174
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:44,360
certainly when I was younger,

3175
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:46,310
nothing warranted.

3176
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:48,500
I had no qualms about,

3177
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:49,011
you know,

3178
01:31:49,011 --> 01:31:49,844
um,

3179
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:52,070
my relationships were secondary.

3180
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:54,350
I would tell somebody that,

3181
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:55,243
you know what I mean?

3182
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:57,620
My band comes first.

3183
01:31:57,860 --> 01:31:59,090
My music that went over,

3184
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:00,431
well,

3185
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:01,264
you know,

3186
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:03,310
I didn't lose any sleep over it.

3187
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:05,530
Isn't that the thing that
always happens in bands?

3188
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:08,530
Like a girl gets in there
like there's always like the,

3189
01:32:08,531 --> 01:32:08,890
uh,

3190
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:09,840
whether it's a lead singer,

3191
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:12,220
a lead guitarist has a wife who,

3192
01:32:12,221 --> 01:32:12,610
uh,

3193
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:16,180
all of a sudden steps into the picture
and she starts telling the other guys

3194
01:32:16,181 --> 01:32:18,700
they have to shape up or do
this or what a nightmare.

3195
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:19,480
What a nightmare.

3196
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:20,720
That's the Valerie Burton Elliot,

3197
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:21,470
you know,

3198
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:21,670
we,

3199
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:22,320
we,

3200
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:22,610
you know,

3201
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:22,771
I,

3202
01:32:22,771 --> 01:32:24,640
I can't speak for any other band.

3203
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:25,630
Uh,

3204
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:29,620
but what I've heard from some
other bands were seen as,

3205
01:32:29,621 --> 01:32:29,891
you know,

3206
01:32:29,891 --> 01:32:30,110
that,

3207
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:30,820
that's,

3208
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:31,750
that's a nightmare.

3209
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:32,703
You know,

3210
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:33,251
look,

3211
01:32:33,251 --> 01:32:33,611
we,

3212
01:32:33,611 --> 01:32:36,370
we still don't let anybody
into our dressing room

3213
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,690
that is sacred ground.

3214
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:41,500
Even,

3215
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,580
even wives.

3216
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:44,650
Nope.

3217
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:45,400
That's,

3218
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,000
you know,

3219
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,590
that is,

3220
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:47,650
that's where we live.

3221
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:50,590
You got to have something that that's,

3222
01:32:50,591 --> 01:32:51,424
um,

3223
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:55,570
either sacred or just belongs to the,

3224
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:57,430
to the four of you or the five of you.

3225
01:32:57,430 --> 01:32:58,090
So,

3226
01:32:58,090 --> 01:32:58,271
you know,

3227
01:32:58,271 --> 01:32:59,140
our dressing room,

3228
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:02,500
our kids once in a while might,

3229
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,400
might come in,

3230
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,260
but everybody knows that's,

3231
01:33:05,261 --> 01:33:06,094
that's,

3232
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,330
that's not for,

3233
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:09,460
that's not for our families,

3234
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:11,150
but your kids.

3235
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:11,920
Yeah,

3236
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:12,753
yeah,

3237
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:13,713
absolutely.

3238
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:17,350
He tell you why tries drop the kids
off and wait for me and on the door I'm

3239
01:33:17,351 --> 01:33:18,280
going to show them how to pack.

3240
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:19,653
Yeah.

3241
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:20,583
So,

3242
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:21,190
wow.

3243
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:22,900
It's a weird ride.

3244
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:23,440
I mean,

3245
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:28,270
did no one else has mean unless
you're talking to other rock stars,

3246
01:33:28,271 --> 01:33:31,060
no one else has experienced
the life that you've had.

3247
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:31,903
It's true.

3248
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:33,280
It's very true.

3249
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:33,870
I mean,

3250
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:34,160
when,

3251
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:37,150
when you politicians
want to be rock stars,

3252
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,930
everybody wants to be a rock rockstar.

3253
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:41,560
Rockstars don't want to be
rockstars want to be rock stars.

3254
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:43,840
The reason everybody wants to be at it's,

3255
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:45,520
it's as good as they say

3256
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:47,651
it.

3257
01:33:47,651 --> 01:33:48,251
Trust me,

3258
01:33:48,251 --> 01:33:48,640
it,

3259
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:49,750
it's awesome.

3260
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:50,853
You know,

3261
01:33:51,230 --> 01:33:52,480
it doesn't have to kill you.

3262
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:53,980
It doesn't have to scar you.

3263
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:55,360
It's awesome.

3264
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:59,500
And you guys had been through the
full spectrum of success 40 years.

3265
01:33:59,520 --> 01:33:59,790
Yeah.

3266
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:00,160
I mean,

3267
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:00,790
you were,

3268
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:04,930
you were gigantic with the makeup and
then what made you take the makeup off?

3269
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:05,400
Like what,

3270
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:06,250
what was that about?

3271
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:07,123
Missteps?

3272
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:07,481
You know,

3273
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:07,701
I,

3274
01:34:07,701 --> 01:34:09,160
I think that again,

3275
01:34:09,161 --> 01:34:09,994
when,

3276
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:10,571
when,

3277
01:34:10,571 --> 01:34:11,404
uh,

3278
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:12,721
when we,

3279
01:34:12,721 --> 01:34:15,310
we booted Peter out of the band,

3280
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,233
um,

3281
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,040
we,

3282
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:20,530
we felt that Eric Carr when he
came in and he did another persona.

3283
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:21,370
So we did that.

3284
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:22,151
And,

3285
01:34:22,151 --> 01:34:22,984
um,

3286
01:34:23,050 --> 01:34:23,883
I think we,

3287
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:29,190
I think between Apathy and laziness
that said in within the band,

3288
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:32,590
we became very,

3289
01:34:32,591 --> 01:34:33,424
uh,

3290
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,780
fat and rich,

3291
01:34:34,781 --> 01:34:34,991
you know,

3292
01:34:34,991 --> 01:34:35,500
just,

3293
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:40,500
we forgot why we loved what we did and
became more involved with trying to get a

3294
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:46,350
approval from our peers
or friends or girlfriends.

3295
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:50,320
And then within the band when we
started bringing in new people,

3296
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:52,630
this whole idea of
creating new characters,

3297
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:56,890
I think we lost the plot
and I'm taking off the,

3298
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,633
was

3299
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,310
like taking a bucket of
cold water in the face.

3300
01:35:01,311 --> 01:35:02,600
It was a way for us to,

3301
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:04,820
to regroup.

3302
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,040
And as far as I was concerned,

3303
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:09,590
it was a time for us to say,

3304
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:11,690
if we're not valid as a band,

3305
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,380
if we're not good enough to be a band,

3306
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:14,840
then we should call it quits.

3307
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:18,500
If we can't exist as a
band without the makeup.

3308
01:35:18,501 --> 01:35:19,340
And quite honestly,

3309
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,020
people had grown tired of it.

3310
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:22,130
Um,

3311
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:24,470
I think people weren't tired of the music,

3312
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:29,060
but they were listening with their
eyes and didn't want to see us anymore.

3313
01:35:29,061 --> 01:35:29,894
They didn't want to see,

3314
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:30,993
um,

3315
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,600
perhaps what we'd become.

3316
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:33,813
Um,

3317
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,300
so I went,

3318
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:36,440
we need to,

3319
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:37,753
to,

3320
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:38,390
you know,

3321
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:39,110
take,

3322
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:42,530
take this chance to take this leap
of faith and take the makeup off.

3323
01:35:42,531 --> 01:35:43,364
And we did.

3324
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:44,061
And,

3325
01:35:44,061 --> 01:35:44,720
um,

3326
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:48,980
you can't compete with
those four iconic images,

3327
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:51,650
no matter what you do without it,

3328
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:53,450
it's always going to Pale.

3329
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:54,771
That being said,

3330
01:35:54,771 --> 01:35:55,610
we were selling,

3331
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:59,390
we were platinum from liquored up on,

3332
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:01,550
but people talk about it.

3333
01:36:01,551 --> 01:36:01,731
Yeah.

3334
01:36:01,731 --> 01:36:02,510
You know,

3335
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:03,780
that was like the downtime.

3336
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,960
Well in a sense.

3337
01:36:05,961 --> 01:36:06,291
Yeah.

3338
01:36:06,291 --> 01:36:06,921
Because,

3339
01:36:06,921 --> 01:36:07,754
um,

3340
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:08,960
you just,

3341
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:09,531
you,

3342
01:36:09,531 --> 01:36:12,080
you pale next to kiss and makeup,

3343
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:13,710
but it,

3344
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:14,480
it,

3345
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,710
it got us through.

3346
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:16,940
Um,

3347
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:17,361
let's see.

3348
01:36:17,361 --> 01:36:20,930
It was probably 13 years
probably without makeup.

3349
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:22,453
And um,

3350
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:23,561
you know,

3351
01:36:23,561 --> 01:36:25,220
we honed our skills and also,

3352
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:26,450
um,

3353
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:31,450
readdressed and recommitted
ourselves to what we once were and,

3354
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:33,950
and worked our way back and um,

3355
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:36,290
sold a lot of albums.

3356
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:38,090
But understandably,

3357
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:40,610
people think of them as the lean years.

3358
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:42,680
Those lean years would
make most bands fat.

3359
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:43,431
Yeah.

3360
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:44,420
We'll look it up.

3361
01:36:44,421 --> 01:36:46,010
It's still one of my all time favorites.

3362
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:49,040
But when you guys took the makeup off,

3363
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:54,041
what was that transition like to go from
being a famous person who has an almost

3364
01:36:55,611 --> 01:37:00,350
a non famous face to being a famous
person that now everybody's like,

3365
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,590
oh,

3366
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:02,443
I loved it.

3367
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:03,500
I loved it.

3368
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,333
You know,

3369
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:05,780
I craved it,

3370
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:06,140
you know,

3371
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:06,920
it was awesome.

3372
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:08,300
It was awesome to finally go,

3373
01:37:08,301 --> 01:37:08,601
yes,

3374
01:37:08,601 --> 01:37:09,141
it's me.

3375
01:37:09,141 --> 01:37:09,974
It's me.

3376
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:11,053
Um,

3377
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:16,250
I loved it and it didn't change who I
was on stage at all because I've never

3378
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,950
really been playing a part.

3379
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:18,910
Um,

3380
01:37:18,910 --> 01:37:22,550
that's why am so whether without makeup,

3381
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:24,710
I'm not looking in a
mirror when I'm on stage,

3382
01:37:24,711 --> 01:37:25,521
I'm just being me.

3383
01:37:25,521 --> 01:37:27,320
So it didn't change.

3384
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,540
It changed.

3385
01:37:28,541 --> 01:37:31,010
I'm changed it for some of the other guys,

3386
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:31,611
but,

3387
01:37:31,611 --> 01:37:32,444
um,

3388
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:34,430
it gave us look it up.

3389
01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:35,390
Heaven's on fire.

3390
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:37,460
A lot of really cool stuff.

3391
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:38,323
Um,

3392
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:40,310
creatures the night war machine.

3393
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:41,061
I love it.

3394
01:37:41,061 --> 01:37:41,421
Loud.

3395
01:37:41,421 --> 01:37:42,254
A lot of,

3396
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:42,930
well,

3397
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:44,810
no makeup.

3398
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:45,051
Yeah,

3399
01:37:45,051 --> 01:37:46,010
that was the last,

3400
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:46,731
yeah,

3401
01:37:46,731 --> 01:37:47,840
that was the last gasp.

3402
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:49,640
I wanted that album without makeup.

3403
01:37:49,641 --> 01:37:50,780
And we kind of,

3404
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:51,650
you know,

3405
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:52,251
understandably,

3406
01:37:52,251 --> 01:37:53,990
Chine was much more reluctant than I was.

3407
01:37:53,991 --> 01:37:56,040
So we look it up was we took it off.

3408
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:58,440
So we,

3409
01:37:58,441 --> 01:37:59,071
we,

3410
01:37:59,071 --> 01:37:59,904
uh,

3411
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,560
we were more in touch with ourselves.

3412
01:38:01,561 --> 01:38:02,970
So after 13 years,

3413
01:38:02,971 --> 01:38:03,804
um,

3414
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:07,650
I remember thinking if we're going to
get back together with the other guys who

3415
01:38:07,651 --> 01:38:09,570
I swore I would never do again,

3416
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:10,101
I had,

3417
01:38:10,101 --> 01:38:12,060
now's the time because
I don't know if any,

3418
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:14,190
if these guys are going
to live that much longer,

3419
01:38:14,191 --> 01:38:14,900
you know,

3420
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:15,733
I don't know.

3421
01:38:15,830 --> 01:38:16,770
I just don't know.

3422
01:38:16,771 --> 01:38:17,520
I don't know.

3423
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,210
I don't know what they've been doing or,

3424
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:19,711
or,

3425
01:38:19,711 --> 01:38:20,544
um,

3426
01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:21,421
you know,

3427
01:38:21,421 --> 01:38:22,590
we're where they've been,

3428
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:23,453
so,

3429
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:24,950
so it's 13 years with no ace,

3430
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:25,111
no,

3431
01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:25,540
Peter.

3432
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:26,190
Um,

3433
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:26,760
I think it was,

3434
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:27,960
it was actually longer.

3435
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:28,853
Um,

3436
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:29,310
uh,

3437
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:34,290
Peter was 1979 and ace was 82.

3438
01:38:36,170 --> 01:38:36,960
So,

3439
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:37,793
um,

3440
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:38,221
you know,

3441
01:38:38,221 --> 01:38:41,730
we reached out to them and went through
a whole lot of song and dance and a

3442
01:38:41,731 --> 01:38:43,590
whole lot of dating,

3443
01:38:43,591 --> 01:38:44,401
so to speak.

3444
01:38:44,401 --> 01:38:45,390
And you know,

3445
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:46,230
um,

3446
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:47,063
ultimately,

3447
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:48,391
uh,

3448
01:38:48,391 --> 01:38:50,430
did kiss on plugged and brought them out.

3449
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:51,590
And then after that we,

3450
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:53,160
we did a full scale reunion,

3451
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:54,450
which was enormous.

3452
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:55,591
And,

3453
01:38:55,591 --> 01:38:56,424
um,

3454
01:38:57,210 --> 01:39:00,030
with two guys who was
so grateful to be back.

3455
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:01,110
You know,

3456
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:03,000
Peter was just a joy.

3457
01:39:03,001 --> 01:39:04,200
I'll never do that again.

3458
01:39:04,201 --> 01:39:04,351
I,

3459
01:39:04,351 --> 01:39:04,841
you know,

3460
01:39:04,841 --> 01:39:05,611
I what I did,

3461
01:39:05,611 --> 01:39:06,330
uh,

3462
01:39:06,330 --> 01:39:08,910
I'm so glad I'm back and
I get a second chance.

3463
01:39:08,911 --> 01:39:12,390
And they were both
terrific for about a week.

3464
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,790
A week longer than that,

3465
01:39:14,791 --> 01:39:15,750
it seems like a week.

3466
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:16,291
It was,

3467
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:17,124
um,

3468
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,620
by midway through the reunion tour,

3469
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:22,140
those cracks just started showing again.

3470
01:39:22,141 --> 01:39:22,491
And,

3471
01:39:22,491 --> 01:39:22,891
and,

3472
01:39:22,891 --> 01:39:23,724
um,

3473
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:27,060
the same stuff started happening and uh,

3474
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:29,671
you know,

3475
01:39:29,671 --> 01:39:31,560
it w it was impossible.

3476
01:39:31,990 --> 01:39:34,620
We did two more tours
after I think we did.

3477
01:39:34,621 --> 01:39:39,621
I'm psycho circus and those
guys were barely on the albums.

3478
01:39:39,781 --> 01:39:40,800
And then we did,

3479
01:39:40,801 --> 01:39:41,634
um,

3480
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,100
the farewell tour and the farewell tour.

3481
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:45,893
Honestly,

3482
01:39:46,090 --> 01:39:47,730
I think we were so miserable.

3483
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:49,080
Gene and I was so miserable.

3484
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:51,540
We were kind of thrown in the towel.

3485
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:55,200
And then by the end of the tour,

3486
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:57,510
I remember a guy and I figured,

3487
01:39:57,511 --> 01:39:57,691
we're,

3488
01:39:57,691 --> 01:39:58,524
we're done.

3489
01:39:58,690 --> 01:39:59,640
It's over.

3490
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:00,390
I was a,

3491
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:02,340
a car wash and one of the guys says to me,

3492
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:02,971
boy,

3493
01:40:02,971 --> 01:40:03,804
I loved,

3494
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:07,500
I loved the farewell tour when you're
doing the 35th anniversary tour.

3495
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:08,410
I went,

3496
01:40:08,410 --> 01:40:08,760
you,

3497
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,350
you don't want us to be gone.

3498
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,260
And I realized that really
what the farewell tour was,

3499
01:40:13,261 --> 01:40:15,210
was saying farewell to those guys again.

3500
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:20,390
And I would never give up the makeup
again and I would never give up the band.

3501
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:25,200
The stance of the band has always
been that the band is bigger than the

3502
01:40:25,201 --> 01:40:30,201
individuals and to suddenly have people
who were sabotaging and compromising the

3503
01:40:32,221 --> 01:40:36,810
band and the fans suddenly in
charge to say the band was over,

3504
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:38,790
was just not going to happen.

3505
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:40,080
So it was a wake up call for me.

3506
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:40,831
So,

3507
01:40:40,831 --> 01:40:41,664
um,

3508
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:43,680
since then it's been,

3509
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:44,761
you know,

3510
01:40:44,761 --> 01:40:47,280
just really just pretty amazing.

3511
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:51,090
What's the difference between going back
and putting the makeup on once people

3512
01:40:51,091 --> 01:40:53,770
already know what your
face looks like and,

3513
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:54,160
you know,

3514
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:54,993
not,

3515
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:56,710
that's a different time in my life.

3516
01:40:56,711 --> 01:41:01,711
I'm a different person and
a really terrific to be
able to experience that kind

3517
01:41:02,621 --> 01:41:07,621
of phenomenal success at a different point
in my life where I appreciate it in a

3518
01:41:07,661 --> 01:41:08,320
different way.

3519
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,750
Most people don't get to to do that,

3520
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:11,130
you know,

3521
01:41:11,130 --> 01:41:11,441
and to,

3522
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:13,270
to regain the championship and,

3523
01:41:13,271 --> 01:41:14,104
and uh,

3524
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:15,333
um,

3525
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:17,260
smell the roses or whatever it,

3526
01:41:17,261 --> 01:41:17,951
it when,

3527
01:41:17,951 --> 01:41:20,380
when you're a little bit more equipped to,

3528
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,210
to appreciate it in a different,

3529
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:24,580
different way to real kiss fans.

3530
01:41:24,581 --> 01:41:28,450
When you guys made that reunion tour and
you got back together with Peter Criss

3531
01:41:28,451 --> 01:41:29,284
and ace freely,

3532
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:30,520
uh,

3533
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,181
Kevin James,

3534
01:41:31,181 --> 01:41:32,090
you know Kevin James Sherman,

3535
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:33,260
queens is core body mine.

3536
01:41:33,261 --> 01:41:33,970
Huge Fan.

3537
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:34,750
Huge Kiss Fan.

3538
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:36,520
So he and I went together.

3539
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:38,020
We went two nights in a row.

3540
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:40,330
We saw you guys in La and uh,

3541
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:41,223
we just,

3542
01:41:41,230 --> 01:41:45,010
we were just going crazy
because it was the whole band.

3543
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:46,720
Everybody was together.

3544
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:50,290
So it was so storybook a me initially.

3545
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:51,220
Yeah.

3546
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:53,350
Did you try to like get
those guys straight?

3547
01:41:53,351 --> 01:41:53,710
Did you?

3548
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:54,340
Sure.

3549
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:55,990
But give them some Ibogaine,

3550
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:57,010
take them to the jungle,

3551
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:57,670
you know,

3552
01:41:57,670 --> 01:41:58,060
look,

3553
01:41:58,060 --> 01:41:58,391
you know,

3554
01:41:58,391 --> 01:41:58,841
it's like,

3555
01:41:58,841 --> 01:41:59,674
um,

3556
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:05,020
I will try to save anybody who was
drowning until they start pulling me under

3557
01:42:05,090 --> 01:42:06,490
and I got to cut them loose.

3558
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:07,353
You know,

3559
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:07,680
it,

3560
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,320
it was,

3561
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:09,930
it was hopeless and his booze.

3562
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:10,751
Is it drugs?

3563
01:42:10,751 --> 01:42:12,620
Is it a combination as a personality?

3564
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:16,990
I think it's just personalities and
everything else exacerbates things,

3565
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:18,640
but it starts with,

3566
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:20,140
with you and who you are.

3567
01:42:20,141 --> 01:42:21,040
The rest of it just,

3568
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,990
just takes it south.

3569
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:23,711
So,

3570
01:42:23,711 --> 01:42:24,544
um,

3571
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:26,373
I just,

3572
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:26,890
you know,

3573
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:31,660
found myself in a position where
the w there was no choice except to,

3574
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:32,830
to change things.

3575
01:42:32,831 --> 01:42:33,460
But look,

3576
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:36,280
all I can tell you is the
band has never been better.

3577
01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:38,080
Never sounded better,

3578
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:42,610
never been more the band that I want it
to be because there were four people now

3579
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:47,880
who truly love and respect the band and
want to do what's best for the band and

3580
01:42:49,931 --> 01:42:52,060
not what's best for them as individuals.

3581
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:55,510
Everybody in the band will
swallow their ego and their pride,

3582
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:56,403
me included,

3583
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,210
to do what's best for the band.

3584
01:42:58,570 --> 01:42:59,403
And uh,

3585
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:00,550
that's a great,

3586
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:01,420
you know,

3587
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:03,220
we built something great on.

3588
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:03,971
Once again,

3589
01:43:03,971 --> 01:43:05,260
it goes back to foundation.

3590
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:08,260
You can't build anything
without a great foundation,

3591
01:43:08,261 --> 01:43:10,960
whether it's your personality
and your life or a band.

3592
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:13,420
So we've got a great foundation,

3593
01:43:13,450 --> 01:43:14,950
but what we built on it is,

3594
01:43:14,951 --> 01:43:16,600
is pretty,

3595
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:17,980
pretty terrific,

3596
01:43:17,981 --> 01:43:18,530
pretty tremendous,

3597
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:22,720
probably much more difficult to take
something for granted when you came into

3598
01:43:22,721 --> 01:43:24,490
the band as a fan of the band.

3599
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:25,780
Now One guy,

3600
01:43:25,781 --> 01:43:26,411
20 years,

3601
01:43:26,411 --> 01:43:26,711
one guy,

3602
01:43:26,711 --> 01:43:27,281
10 years,

3603
01:43:27,281 --> 01:43:29,500
you're talking about
a 40 year plus career.

3604
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,393
Yeah.

3605
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:30,820
Yeah.

3606
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:31,420
And,

3607
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:32,410
and honestly,

3608
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:37,080
they are tremendous contributors and,

3609
01:43:37,081 --> 01:43:40,120
and great to be around
and we all socialize,

3610
01:43:40,121 --> 01:43:41,860
which is something terrific.

3611
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:46,600
The combustibility of that original
band was perhaps what made it in the

3612
01:43:46,601 --> 01:43:47,171
beginning,

3613
01:43:47,171 --> 01:43:51,130
but made it inevitable
that it would combust.

3614
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:51,531
You know,

3615
01:43:51,531 --> 01:43:52,220
it was,

3616
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,390
it was so volatile.

3617
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:58,660
I really hoped when we did the reunion
that we could move forward and take the

3618
01:43:59,751 --> 01:44:01,280
band and,

3619
01:44:01,281 --> 01:44:02,030
uh,

3620
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:02,760
see it to that,

3621
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:03,140
you know,

3622
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:04,340
happily ever after.

3623
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:05,271
But,

3624
01:44:05,271 --> 01:44:06,104
um,

3625
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:07,543
you know,

3626
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:08,750
the wizard of Oz,

3627
01:44:08,751 --> 01:44:09,471
it's just,

3628
01:44:09,471 --> 01:44:10,304
uh,

3629
01:44:10,930 --> 01:44:11,480
it's,

3630
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,021
it's not,

3631
01:44:12,021 --> 01:44:12,530
it's not,

3632
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:13,400
it's not that.

3633
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:14,540
It's just not that way.

3634
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:14,871
Well,

3635
01:44:14,871 --> 01:44:15,200
even at,

3636
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:15,411
you know,

3637
01:44:15,411 --> 01:44:16,790
as you described your own life,

3638
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:17,061
you're,

3639
01:44:17,061 --> 01:44:20,870
the change of your perception
of the world was a slow,

3640
01:44:20,871 --> 01:44:23,540
gradual thing with a conscious effort.

3641
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:27,050
Without that conscious effort
changes virtually impossible.

3642
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:30,800
And these guys just getting this second
chance probably gave them a lot of

3643
01:44:30,801 --> 01:44:32,600
enthusiasm and a lot of,

3644
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:32,811
you know,

3645
01:44:32,811 --> 01:44:35,060
I'll never do it again
because they recognize like,

3646
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:35,451
wow,

3647
01:44:35,451 --> 01:44:35,931
holy shit,

3648
01:44:35,931 --> 01:44:36,764
I'm a kiss again.

3649
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:37,491
Here we are,

3650
01:44:37,491 --> 01:44:38,181
we're doing it again,

3651
01:44:38,181 --> 01:44:38,930
we're back.

3652
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:43,930
But ultimately if you're more concerned
and driven or or or ruined by what

3653
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:49,760
someone else has rather
than what you have,

3654
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:53,630
if you're more concerned with
me making more money than you,

3655
01:44:53,631 --> 01:44:58,280
which is just a given because I
never left the band once or twice.

3656
01:44:58,281 --> 01:45:01,210
So that became a big issue
once you guys well be,

3657
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:03,980
it's surfaced and it was only one of,

3658
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:04,860
you know,

3659
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:08,510
a lot of issues that that once
again came to the surface.

3660
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:11,210
But that was one that was not negotiable.

3661
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:13,910
And did you think that it could
have possibly even helped?

3662
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:14,751
I mean if you said,

3663
01:45:14,751 --> 01:45:14,961
okay,

3664
01:45:14,961 --> 01:45:16,010
listen guys,

3665
01:45:16,011 --> 01:45:17,150
we're back where the band,

3666
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:18,950
let's go 25% all around.

3667
01:45:18,951 --> 01:45:19,111
We,

3668
01:45:19,111 --> 01:45:19,341
we,

3669
01:45:19,341 --> 01:45:20,970
we that that's a,

3670
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:23,510
that's a movie we already
saw and it didn't work.

3671
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:24,441
You know,

3672
01:45:24,441 --> 01:45:24,561
we,

3673
01:45:24,561 --> 01:45:26,870
we did that the first time
around and it didn't work.

3674
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:30,860
And here we are 13 or 15 years later,

3675
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:36,700
bringing two guys back in who were
virtually broke and have no career into a

3676
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:41,240
band that is maintained platinum status.

3677
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:44,030
And you don't come in as a,

3678
01:45:44,031 --> 01:45:45,320
as a partner in equal.

3679
01:45:45,321 --> 01:45:46,154
You come in,

3680
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:47,623
um,

3681
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:52,990
as someone who who is paid and salaried,

3682
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:54,920
now mind you once again,

3683
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:55,941
when,

3684
01:45:55,941 --> 01:45:56,570
when,

3685
01:45:56,570 --> 01:45:57,403
uh,

3686
01:45:57,740 --> 01:46:00,320
rejoining the band is making
you a millionaire again,

3687
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:01,663
I wouldn't,

3688
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:01,921
you know,

3689
01:46:01,921 --> 01:46:02,751
I w I wouldn't,

3690
01:46:02,751 --> 01:46:03,584
uh,

3691
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:07,280
bring out any hankies
to wipe my tears away.

3692
01:46:07,281 --> 01:46:08,114
These,

3693
01:46:08,290 --> 01:46:09,081
they did very,

3694
01:46:09,081 --> 01:46:09,651
very well,

3695
01:46:09,651 --> 01:46:13,160
but they just didn't do as well as
you and Jean and nor should they.

3696
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:14,180
Yeah.

3697
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:14,970
Not sure.

3698
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:15,740
I see your point.

3699
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:16,550
I see your point.

3700
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:18,320
I could see how they get bitter about it,

3701
01:46:18,321 --> 01:46:18,620
but,

3702
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:20,090
but once again,

3703
01:46:20,091 --> 01:46:21,620
there was more to it than then.

3704
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:22,660
Again,

3705
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:23,493
um,

3706
01:46:24,110 --> 01:46:29,110
drugs and sycophantic relationships
and over inflated ideas of,

3707
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:34,670
of who they were and what they could do.

3708
01:46:35,350 --> 01:46:36,183
Um,

3709
01:46:36,210 --> 01:46:37,043
it's just didn't work.

3710
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,200
What seems like with every band,

3711
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:42,680
there's always this ultimate conflict.

3712
01:46:42,890 --> 01:46:46,310
And one of the things that you guys
have managed to do is whatever conflicts

3713
01:46:46,311 --> 01:46:47,300
that you've had with gene,

3714
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:48,860
he guys have managed to stay together.

3715
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:49,841
Gene and I are,

3716
01:46:49,841 --> 01:46:50,070
are,

3717
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,050
are so unlike each other.

3718
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,360
I mean completely unlike,

3719
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:54,770
you know,

3720
01:46:54,770 --> 01:46:56,610
if somebody was just
saying that this morning,

3721
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:57,743
um,

3722
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:01,620
but we're together for
45 years I think now.

3723
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:03,030
That's insane.

3724
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:03,780
Yeah.

3725
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:05,220
That's from when I was two.

3726
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:06,140
Yeah.

3727
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:06,973
Yeah.

3728
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:08,580
That's incredible.

3729
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:09,030
Yeah.

3730
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:09,421
And,

3731
01:47:09,421 --> 01:47:10,254
uh,

3732
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:14,220
we're together because we have a common
bond and we have something that we

3733
01:47:14,221 --> 01:47:18,690
believe in and we have a work
ethic and we put other stuff aside.

3734
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:19,111
I mean,

3735
01:47:19,111 --> 01:47:19,860
there's been times,

3736
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:22,790
certainly where we weren't
getting along very well at all or,

3737
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:23,633
or,

3738
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:24,030
um,

3739
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:25,020
not speaking,

3740
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,430
but we're in the band together.

3741
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:27,780
So you were not speaking,

3742
01:47:27,781 --> 01:47:29,070
but yet you were playing together.

3743
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:29,690
Yeah.

3744
01:47:29,690 --> 01:47:30,630
There have been some,

3745
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:31,493
some times of,

3746
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:32,760
um,

3747
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:35,400
some real resentment and real anger.

3748
01:47:35,401 --> 01:47:35,761
But,

3749
01:47:35,761 --> 01:47:36,594
um,

3750
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:37,740
so what,

3751
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:38,011
I mean,

3752
01:47:38,011 --> 01:47:38,191
we're,

3753
01:47:38,191 --> 01:47:38,491
we're,

3754
01:47:38,491 --> 01:47:42,210
we're still here and we do what's
best for the band and always have.

3755
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:43,021
And that's amazing.

3756
01:47:43,021 --> 01:47:44,610
And we've never gotten along better as,

3757
01:47:45,150 --> 01:47:45,871
that's incredible.

3758
01:47:45,871 --> 01:47:47,130
Like how did you guys do that?

3759
01:47:47,131 --> 01:47:48,420
When you're performing on stage,

3760
01:47:48,421 --> 01:47:49,920
if you weren't speaking to each other,

3761
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:53,280
well I mean more or less
not speaking to each other,

3762
01:47:53,281 --> 01:47:53,490
right?

3763
01:47:53,490 --> 01:47:55,770
Disliking each other and intensely,

3764
01:47:56,490 --> 01:48:00,000
but you get up and that's
where we make magic.

3765
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:00,870
You know,

3766
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:02,850
I said to another band are really,

3767
01:48:02,851 --> 01:48:03,960
really big band.

3768
01:48:03,970 --> 01:48:05,670
Nickelback no are really,

3769
01:48:05,671 --> 01:48:06,504
really big band.

3770
01:48:06,810 --> 01:48:07,643
And um,

3771
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:08,590
I,

3772
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:08,880
you know,

3773
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:11,790
they were complaining about the
relationships within the band and I said,

3774
01:48:11,791 --> 01:48:12,480
you know,

3775
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:14,220
you don't have to love
everybody in the office.

3776
01:48:14,970 --> 01:48:15,481
And I said,

3777
01:48:15,481 --> 01:48:16,314
in your case,

3778
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,630
if you can make magic on stage,

3779
01:48:18,631 --> 01:48:20,010
anything else is a bonus.

3780
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:24,660
So the fact that you get up there
and are a great band should suffice.

3781
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:26,041
You want more?

3782
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:26,910
Go get a family,

3783
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:28,823
you know?

3784
01:48:29,070 --> 01:48:29,790
Um,

3785
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:30,031
the,

3786
01:48:30,031 --> 01:48:30,864
the,

3787
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:34,500
the key to a great partnership
is knowing it's limitations.

3788
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:37,680
He should give seminars on
how to keep a band together.

3789
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:38,790
I should give seminars.

3790
01:48:38,791 --> 01:48:39,300
Period.

3791
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:39,631
Yeah.

3792
01:48:39,631 --> 01:48:40,590
Why don't you give seminars?

3793
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:41,663
I've been asked.

3794
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:43,050
You should really,

3795
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:44,220
you're an inspirational guy.

3796
01:48:44,221 --> 01:48:44,371
I mean,

3797
01:48:44,371 --> 01:48:46,890
it's not just that you're
an iconic rock figure,

3798
01:48:46,891 --> 01:48:49,140
but you're a very down to
earth and very centered.

3799
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:49,970
Very.

3800
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:51,300
Do you meditate at all?

3801
01:48:51,301 --> 01:48:51,781
Do you do anything?

3802
01:48:51,781 --> 01:48:52,350
No,

3803
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:54,760
just just the therapy and Jim more.

3804
01:48:54,761 --> 01:48:55,900
It's just the daily.

3805
01:48:56,110 --> 01:48:56,943
Yeah,

3806
01:48:57,290 --> 01:49:00,300
it's good to be Paul Stanley and you know,

3807
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:01,980
it's great to work,

3808
01:49:01,981 --> 01:49:02,341
work,

3809
01:49:02,341 --> 01:49:03,990
work and find yourself at a,

3810
01:49:03,991 --> 01:49:04,824
at a great,

3811
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:05,580
you know,

3812
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:06,480
juncture in your life,

3813
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:07,650
enjoying your work,

3814
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:10,220
enjoying we're enjoying
your life and being,

3815
01:49:10,221 --> 01:49:10,800
and not,

3816
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,850
not using your work as
an escape from your life.

3817
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:17,130
And most of most,

3818
01:49:17,131 --> 01:49:17,520
you know,

3819
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:18,390
a lot of performers,

3820
01:49:18,391 --> 01:49:19,051
I won't say most,

3821
01:49:19,051 --> 01:49:23,640
but a lot of performers use their work
as an escape to get away from a life that

3822
01:49:23,641 --> 01:49:24,390
they don't like.

3823
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:27,780
And he gives this something that you
figured out over the years through therapy

3824
01:49:27,781 --> 01:49:30,660
and through thinking
and analyzing and yeah,

3825
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:31,581
I mean I,

3826
01:49:31,581 --> 01:49:33,810
I can't put everything on therapy,

3827
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,690
but I'm innately,

3828
01:49:36,691 --> 01:49:39,030
it comes down to once again,

3829
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:42,630
do you like who's who you see
in the mirror and if you don't,

3830
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:46,980
how do you make yourself like that person
and therapy and even pursuing it was

3831
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:49,720
sort of obviously because of that,

3832
01:49:49,721 --> 01:49:50,554
because of this,

3833
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:51,070
this,

3834
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:51,460
this,

3835
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:52,300
this thinking.

3836
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:52,571
Yeah,

3837
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:53,051
just going,

3838
01:49:53,051 --> 01:49:54,100
well this isn't working.

3839
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:58,450
Maybe somebody else can enlighten
me or direct me on another way.

3840
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:00,400
Did we figure out how
much radium had made?

3841
01:50:00,650 --> 01:50:01,483
Uh,

3842
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:05,990
it was arguable they sold around
3 million copies of that album.

3843
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:07,103
Uh,

3844
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:07,820
right.

3845
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:11,090
They also said that three
times that one on bittorrent.

3846
01:50:11,870 --> 01:50:13,100
So that did make money.

3847
01:50:13,850 --> 01:50:14,683
Um,

3848
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:16,490
whether or not they would
have made 10 times that,

3849
01:50:16,491 --> 01:50:16,880
who knows,

3850
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:17,271
why would it be,

3851
01:50:17,271 --> 01:50:17,811
I'm a bit torn.

3852
01:50:17,811 --> 01:50:18,860
If you could pay whatever you want,

3853
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:20,210
you can pay whatever you want.

3854
01:50:20,330 --> 01:50:23,300
But yet they also sold
a special copies of it.

3855
01:50:23,301 --> 01:50:24,440
They sold an album version.

3856
01:50:24,441 --> 01:50:28,700
They sold a special box version
and 100,000 copies of that.

3857
01:50:28,730 --> 01:50:28,971
Right.

3858
01:50:28,971 --> 01:50:31,400
And what did it work out to per album?

3859
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:32,060
It didn't,

3860
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:34,900
the information I was finding
didn't say Ppar Alpha.

3861
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:37,150
They kept their mouth shut about it was,

3862
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:40,010
it was a disaster.

3863
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:40,731
As soon as it went on.

3864
01:50:40,731 --> 01:50:43,220
Bit Torrent free stopped.

3865
01:50:43,221 --> 01:50:44,240
As soon as bit torrent went on,

3866
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:44,600
they were like,

3867
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:44,931
oh,

3868
01:50:44,931 --> 01:50:45,764
and I'm more free.

3869
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:46,581
Oh really?

3870
01:50:46,581 --> 01:50:46,710
Yeah,

3871
01:50:46,710 --> 01:50:46,840
yeah,

3872
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:47,250
yeah.

3873
01:50:47,250 --> 01:50:47,550
When it,

3874
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:48,820
when I bit too aren't they got mad?

3875
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:49,661
Oh wait,

3876
01:50:49,661 --> 01:50:50,411
just kidding.

3877
01:50:50,411 --> 01:50:51,244
Just kidding.

3878
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:52,960
Dark bags of the world.

3879
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:55,390
You guys are going to
do a residency in Vegas?

3880
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:56,290
We are.

3881
01:50:56,290 --> 01:50:57,590
We are at the end of this month.

3882
01:50:57,610 --> 01:50:58,443
They are dude,

3883
01:50:58,480 --> 01:50:59,110
that's awesome.

3884
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:00,100
I'm going to be watching that.

3885
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:00,520
Great.

3886
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:01,091
Where are you going to be?

3887
01:51:01,091 --> 01:51:01,340
What?

3888
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:01,870
What about?

3889
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:03,940
We're at the hard rock in the joint.

3890
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:06,340
We mainly were doing Wednesdays,

3891
01:51:06,341 --> 01:51:07,390
Fridays and Saturdays,

3892
01:51:07,391 --> 01:51:08,650
although it's switches a bit.

3893
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:09,753
And um,

3894
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:10,713
we're actually,

3895
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:11,650
um,

3896
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:16,480
I think we're 40% above any other band
that's done the done the residency there

3897
01:51:16,570 --> 01:51:17,620
with ticket sales writing.

3898
01:51:17,950 --> 01:51:18,311
So,

3899
01:51:18,311 --> 01:51:18,820
um,

3900
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:21,310
the joints of good venue
that's not too big.

3901
01:51:21,530 --> 01:51:22,363
It's intimate.

3902
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:25,050
And what's really interesting is when you,

3903
01:51:25,051 --> 01:51:26,230
you play a small place,

3904
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:27,730
you tend to downsize.

3905
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:31,420
We actually are cramming more stuff
in so it's re because we don't have to

3906
01:51:31,421 --> 01:51:32,254
travel with it.

3907
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:33,460
So we're really,

3908
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:34,450
oh yeah.

3909
01:51:34,451 --> 01:51:35,020
Right.

3910
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:35,680
We're really,

3911
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,420
we're really gearing
up for something great.

3912
01:51:37,421 --> 01:51:38,290
And at the end of this month,

3913
01:51:38,291 --> 01:51:38,681
we do,

3914
01:51:38,681 --> 01:51:39,280
um,

3915
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:39,971
the kiss cruise,

3916
01:51:39,971 --> 01:51:41,920
which goes out every year and has,

3917
01:51:41,921 --> 01:51:42,470
uh,

3918
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:42,700
you know,

3919
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:47,020
about 3,500 fans from 33 countries
around the world get on the ship and,

3920
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:51,370
and spent four days a rocket
in Roland bring other bands.

3921
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:52,313
Wow.

3922
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:54,280
So you hang out with these
freaks for four days.

3923
01:51:54,281 --> 01:51:55,001
We don't hang out.

3924
01:51:55,001 --> 01:51:55,141
We,

3925
01:51:55,141 --> 01:51:55,661
we do.

3926
01:51:55,661 --> 01:51:56,140
Um,

3927
01:51:56,140 --> 01:52:00,370
we do two shows in a theater and um,

3928
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:00,931
then we,

3929
01:52:00,931 --> 01:52:04,930
we go to an island and we do an acoustic
set there and then we have other bands

3930
01:52:04,931 --> 01:52:06,190
with us the night before.

3931
01:52:06,191 --> 01:52:09,880
We leave port cheap trick
plays and it's great.

3932
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:13,330
So we do that and then we
do the Vegas residency.

3933
01:52:13,690 --> 01:52:13,961
Wow.

3934
01:52:13,961 --> 01:52:14,950
So you do this,

3935
01:52:14,951 --> 01:52:15,490
this,

3936
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:16,323
this,

3937
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:20,860
this tour on this boat and you're
trapped on a boat with all these people.

3938
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:22,540
That doesn't freak you out at all?

3939
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:22,871
Well,

3940
01:52:22,871 --> 01:52:23,051
no,

3941
01:52:23,051 --> 01:52:26,910
because we have a section
to ourselves where we're,

3942
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:27,820
nobody can come.

3943
01:52:27,821 --> 01:52:32,530
And so that's where you got to do to the
ear pieces and then they're on the boat

3944
01:52:32,531 --> 01:52:33,440
and the AK seven.

3945
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:34,601
Yeah,

3946
01:52:34,601 --> 01:52:36,970
I would think that that would
be the one thing that was like,

3947
01:52:36,971 --> 01:52:39,070
I know opie and Anthony
were going to do a,

3948
01:52:39,071 --> 01:52:41,230
a a boat tour and I was like,

3949
01:52:41,231 --> 01:52:42,064
man,

3950
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:46,220
I have to say the first tee I dreaded,

3951
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:46,761
you know,

3952
01:52:46,761 --> 01:52:51,440
I dreaded the idea of him
and I'm four years into it.

3953
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:51,801
I mean,

3954
01:52:51,801 --> 01:52:52,670
my family comes,

3955
01:52:52,671 --> 01:52:53,460
it's awesome.

3956
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:53,590
Well,

3957
01:52:53,590 --> 01:52:57,650
it's gotta be amazing to have
3,500 fans on a boat with you.

3958
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:57,831
Well,

3959
01:52:57,831 --> 01:53:02,270
the beautiful thing about it is
that they're from all walks of life.

3960
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:03,110
I mean,

3961
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:06,020
a guide last year was in full gear,

3962
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:08,480
all my full gear and gave me a book.

3963
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:09,600
He was a doctor and he,

3964
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:11,450
he wrote a book on forensic science,

3965
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:11,901
full gear,

3966
01:53:11,901 --> 01:53:13,040
meaning he's dressed like you.

3967
01:53:13,041 --> 01:53:13,580
Yeah.

3968
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:14,660
That's gonna be weird.

3969
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:15,553
Yeah.

3970
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:16,853
So you have,

3971
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:17,361
you know,

3972
01:53:17,361 --> 01:53:20,690
you have gays and straights and you know,

3973
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:22,183
every,

3974
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:23,780
every permutation of,

3975
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:24,440
of,

3976
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:25,290
of life and,

3977
01:53:25,291 --> 01:53:26,124
and it's awesome.

3978
01:53:26,330 --> 01:53:26,930
Wow.

3979
01:53:26,930 --> 01:53:27,763
It's awesome.

3980
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:31,430
That's got to be strange seeing
people dressed as your character.

3981
01:53:31,460 --> 01:53:31,581
Well,

3982
01:53:31,581 --> 01:53:32,401
it's great when,

3983
01:53:32,401 --> 01:53:37,040
when you realize that you've got people
from 30 plus countries and what holds

3984
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:37,970
them all together,

3985
01:53:38,150 --> 01:53:39,950
what they share in common is kiss.

3986
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:41,850
I think it's,

3987
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:42,460
it's,

3988
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:42,820
it's,

3989
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:44,360
it's so cool because I always go,

3990
01:53:44,361 --> 01:53:44,990
you know,

3991
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:46,910
rock bands make music phenomenons,

3992
01:53:46,911 --> 01:53:48,080
impacts society,

3993
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:48,951
you know,

3994
01:53:48,951 --> 01:53:49,101
and,

3995
01:53:49,101 --> 01:53:49,730
and that's,

3996
01:53:49,730 --> 01:53:51,200
that's the difference.

3997
01:53:51,201 --> 01:53:53,240
And that's what kisses
kisses a phenomenon.

3998
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:54,070
Yeah.

3999
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:55,700
You've bypassed the rockstar status.

4000
01:53:55,701 --> 01:53:56,534
Now you're,

4001
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:57,590
you're a phenomenon,

4002
01:53:57,830 --> 01:54:01,130
but you can still see
me buying groceries now.

4003
01:54:01,150 --> 01:54:01,320
Uh,

4004
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:02,180
the hard rock,

4005
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:02,810
um,

4006
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:03,860
when it does start,

4007
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:05,720
it starts November 5th,

4008
01:54:05,721 --> 01:54:06,554
I believe.

4009
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:08,180
How long it's gonna run till it's,

4010
01:54:08,181 --> 01:54:09,350
it's that month.

4011
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:10,393
And I know,

4012
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:11,953
well,

4013
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:13,370
I'm sure we'll,

4014
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:14,293
we'll be back.

4015
01:54:15,110 --> 01:54:18,620
What happens in Vegas is
worth seeing in Vegas twice.

4016
01:54:19,370 --> 01:54:19,730
Yeah.

4017
01:54:19,730 --> 01:54:20,060
Um,

4018
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:21,710
so how many nights a week
are you guys doing it?

4019
01:54:21,711 --> 01:54:22,220
Three,

4020
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:23,090
three nights away.

4021
01:54:23,210 --> 01:54:26,570
So in stays initially it's Wednesdays,

4022
01:54:26,570 --> 01:54:27,320
Fridays and Saturdays.

4023
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:28,910
So you just take Thursday off and then,

4024
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:29,510
yeah,

4025
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:30,560
I'd fly over the weekend.

4026
01:54:30,590 --> 01:54:30,711
Oh,

4027
01:54:30,711 --> 01:54:31,340
you fought him?

4028
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:32,173
Yeah.

4029
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:32,831
Gotcha.

4030
01:54:32,831 --> 01:54:33,664
The kids to school.

4031
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:36,500
Could you imagine living
there and doing that?

4032
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:37,733
Um,

4033
01:54:38,150 --> 01:54:42,080
I know people who live outside
of Vegas and they like it.

4034
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:42,771
And,

4035
01:54:42,771 --> 01:54:43,604
uh,

4036
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:44,000
I,

4037
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:44,770
you know,

4038
01:54:44,770 --> 01:54:46,070
Penn Jillette seems to love it,

4039
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:48,440
but I was looking at him sideways
when he tells me that like,

4040
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,393
hmm.

4041
01:54:49,970 --> 01:54:50,511
Did you see,

4042
01:54:50,511 --> 01:54:51,344
um,

4043
01:54:51,460 --> 01:54:52,293
um,

4044
01:54:52,370 --> 01:54:54,050
Tim's Vermeer movie?

4045
01:54:54,051 --> 01:54:55,670
He did know what does that,

4046
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:56,271
it's,

4047
01:54:56,271 --> 01:54:57,104
um,

4048
01:54:57,110 --> 01:54:57,381
a guy,

4049
01:54:57,381 --> 01:54:58,191
he knows a,

4050
01:54:58,191 --> 01:55:00,140
an inventor and made a lot of money,

4051
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:00,921
had this,

4052
01:55:00,921 --> 01:55:01,754
um,

4053
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:02,601
interest in,

4054
01:55:02,601 --> 01:55:06,710
in the painter Vermeer and nobody can
quite figure out how Vermeer painted

4055
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:07,461
because,

4056
01:55:07,461 --> 01:55:08,080
uh,

4057
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:08,370
he,

4058
01:55:08,370 --> 01:55:09,290
he seemed to,

4059
01:55:09,890 --> 01:55:11,300
he didn't sketch underneath and,

4060
01:55:11,301 --> 01:55:12,134
and his,

4061
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:12,651
his,

4062
01:55:12,651 --> 01:55:13,310
um,

4063
01:55:13,310 --> 01:55:14,570
handling of light is very,

4064
01:55:14,571 --> 01:55:15,770
very unique anyway,

4065
01:55:15,771 --> 01:55:16,390
so,

4066
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:17,223
um,

4067
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:18,153
uh,

4068
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:19,210
uh,

4069
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:21,140
Penn Intel did this
movie with their friend,

4070
01:55:21,190 --> 01:55:21,680
um,

4071
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:22,790
documenting his,

4072
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,190
his quest to,

4073
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:27,690
to understand how Vermeer painted.

4074
01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:27,840
It's,

4075
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:28,250
it's,

4076
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:28,921
it's fabulous.

4077
01:55:28,921 --> 01:55:29,510
It won,

4078
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:32,360
won an academy award I think late
last year or the year before.

4079
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:34,160
I've never heard of this guy before.

4080
01:55:34,161 --> 01:55:35,390
What's so unique about his painting?

4081
01:55:35,710 --> 01:55:36,171
Vermeer,

4082
01:55:36,171 --> 01:55:36,830
um,

4083
01:55:36,830 --> 01:55:38,240
was a Dutch painter who,

4084
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:39,573
um,

4085
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:41,530
just seem to,

4086
01:55:41,530 --> 01:55:46,260
to understand light in a way that was
photographic as opposed to what you'd see

4087
01:55:46,261 --> 01:55:47,160
in normal paintings.

4088
01:55:47,161 --> 01:55:47,680
And,

4089
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:47,820
uh,

4090
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:49,710
there's no outlines around anything.

4091
01:55:49,890 --> 01:55:52,260
It's almost like he just
painted without ever.

4092
01:55:53,610 --> 01:55:57,780
Somehow you looked at
something and painted it and
it's a very interesting film.

4093
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,100
It's a documentary,

4094
01:55:59,101 --> 01:56:00,150
but fascinating.

4095
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:01,980
And they're the ones behind the film.

4096
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:02,311
Well,

4097
01:56:02,311 --> 01:56:02,671
pens,

4098
01:56:02,671 --> 01:56:05,100
a very unique thinker and he's also a guy.

4099
01:56:05,130 --> 01:56:05,820
No drugs,

4100
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:06,653
no alcohol,

4101
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:07,470
no nothing.

4102
01:56:07,470 --> 01:56:07,651
Yeah,

4103
01:56:07,651 --> 01:56:08,550
he lives in Vegas,

4104
01:56:08,551 --> 01:56:09,660
works in show business.

4105
01:56:09,661 --> 01:56:11,940
Was a Carney at one point in time,

4106
01:56:11,941 --> 01:56:12,211
you know,

4107
01:56:12,211 --> 01:56:13,860
is a professional magician.

4108
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:14,550
You know,

4109
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:15,450
all of those things.

4110
01:56:15,451 --> 01:56:19,150
You would think a guy
who's crazy off the rails,

4111
01:56:19,151 --> 01:56:19,984
self-destructive.

4112
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:20,430
Nope.

4113
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:21,031
None of the above.

4114
01:56:21,031 --> 01:56:21,421
Very,

4115
01:56:21,421 --> 01:56:22,530
very intelligent guy,

4116
01:56:22,531 --> 01:56:23,490
very introspective,

4117
01:56:23,491 --> 01:56:24,570
always in deep thought,

4118
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:26,160
has a great podcast.

4119
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:26,881
Really,

4120
01:56:26,881 --> 01:56:27,330
uh,

4121
01:56:27,330 --> 01:56:29,040
had a great radio show before that.

4122
01:56:29,370 --> 01:56:30,930
He just sees a very unique dude.

4123
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:32,131
You know,

4124
01:56:32,131 --> 01:56:36,510
fame gives you the opportunity to have
an amazing life or to kill yourself

4125
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:39,181
with or without it,

4126
01:56:39,181 --> 01:56:39,331
right?

4127
01:56:39,331 --> 01:56:39,570
Yeah.

4128
01:56:39,570 --> 01:56:40,350
Take your choice.

4129
01:56:40,350 --> 01:56:40,620
Well,

4130
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:41,431
we're all gonna die.

4131
01:56:41,431 --> 01:56:42,360
It's just a matter of when.

4132
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:46,020
So how do people get tickets to the Vegas
thing that get through the hard rock?

4133
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:48,180
I have no idea.

4134
01:56:48,181 --> 01:56:49,014
I'm just,

4135
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:51,000
I'm talking guitar player.

4136
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:52,740
I just sing exactly.

4137
01:56:53,530 --> 01:56:54,720
Love Gun and Detroit,

4138
01:56:54,721 --> 01:56:55,291
rock city.

4139
01:56:55,291 --> 01:56:59,560
And stridor and come on and love me
and firehouse and hotter than hell.

4140
01:56:59,561 --> 01:57:00,570
And you know,

4141
01:57:00,620 --> 01:57:01,230
it.

4142
01:57:01,230 --> 01:57:01,801
Shout it out.

4143
01:57:01,801 --> 01:57:01,921
Lie.

4144
01:57:01,921 --> 01:57:02,754
That's just what I do.

4145
01:57:03,210 --> 01:57:04,050
That is what you do.

4146
01:57:04,110 --> 01:57:04,820
And uh,

4147
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:05,820
it's been a real privilege,

4148
01:57:05,821 --> 01:57:06,061
man.

4149
01:57:06,061 --> 01:57:06,781
Thank you very much.

4150
01:57:06,781 --> 01:57:07,860
Been an honor to have you on here.

4151
01:57:07,861 --> 01:57:08,431
I really,

4152
01:57:08,431 --> 01:57:09,151
really appreciate it.

4153
01:57:09,151 --> 01:57:10,320
I've been a fan for so long,

4154
01:57:10,321 --> 01:57:12,180
so I was like kid in
the candy store today.

4155
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:12,690
Awesome.

4156
01:57:12,690 --> 01:57:13,230
Awesome.

4157
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:13,920
Thank you very much.

4158
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,240
Thank you Paul Stanley,

4159
01:57:15,241 --> 01:57:16,074
ladies and gentlemen.

4160
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:17,460
That's it.

4161
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:18,293
We're done.

4162
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:20,123
Awesome.

4163
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:23,280
Uncle Vinny.
