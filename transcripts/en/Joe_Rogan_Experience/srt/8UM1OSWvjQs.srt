1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,083
Okay.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,640
Brian Post St Ladies and gentlemen
just got done doing the podcast.

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,091
You're hilarious.

4
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:17,690
As always.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,523
Thanks buddy.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,540
Brian is one of those dudes that I've
known for about probably 15 years or

7
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,374
something like that.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,770
But I've been down here since.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,130
This is the first time we ever really
sat down and were like a serious

10
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:29,330
conversation for sure.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,230
But we talked when we
worked together show.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:31,910
But yeah,

13
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,681
nothing like that.

14
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:33,800
Like the two hours.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,131
That was fun man.

16
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:35,964
It was cool.

17
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,420
Brian is no longer in the pot club.

18
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,290
You folks,

19
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,123
I'll be back.

20
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,020
We caught him three months completely
sober cause that's gotta be a weird thing

21
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:46,400
to be like the POC community.

22
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:47,420
He was one of those guys,

23
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:48,254
one of them.

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,490
I'm worth the metal community until
somebody pointed out to me and I was like,

25
00:00:52,491 --> 00:00:52,731
yeah,

26
00:00:52,731 --> 00:00:53,270
you're right.

27
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,510
Yeah.

28
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,990
But uh,

29
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,260
yeah,

30
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,570
definitely don't do that many pot jokes,

31
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,640
but it all kind of came from a plot place.

32
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,190
I mean,

33
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,310
most of those jokes were
written while I was high.

34
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,091
And the thing,

35
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:05,100
the important thing is that he's the one
that indoctrinated duct Bateson who's

36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,910
probably the biggest pothead comedian.

37
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:11,240
I mean nobody's connected more
to pot as a comic than duck.

38
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,470
It's like teaching karyotype
about props like yes,

39
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,933
exactly.

40
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,150
But it's worse.

41
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,940
These two things together
and make fun of that.

42
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,190
I did that.

43
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,490
I wouldn't,

44
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,261
I wouldn't say worse,

45
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:26,600
but I mean it's bigger because carrot
tops not spreading props all across the

46
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:28,250
country and getting
other people to do props.

47
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:29,870
So that's done for that movie.

48
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:30,361
Super High.

49
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:30,860
Me.

50
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,200
How many people got started
smoking weed because of that movie?

51
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,910
That a lot.

52
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,430
Yeah,

53
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,720
I've been a lot of people
looked at that and go,

54
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:36,560
what the fuck man?

55
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,513
He looks fine.

56
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,100
Print would bring up all over here.

57
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,210
So this is if you,

58
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:43,880
if you're upset and Doug
done some monsters I guess.

59
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,090
Yeah,

60
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:44,923
I bet you did dude.

61
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,383
You spawned it.

62
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,421
Brian Post saying,

63
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:48,254
ladies and gentlemen,

64
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,190
thanks for being on the podcast.

65
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,460
Thanks.

66
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:49,880
Awesome.

67
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,300
Thank you.

68
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,133
Appreciate it.

69
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,550
Looks like that city and salt city.

70
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:02,384
What's the,

71
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,130
all this salt on the ground is
actually what I get out of the tub.

72
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,773
The tank rather,

73
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,440
and it's also because a,

74
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,450
at one point in time,

75
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:16,451
back in the past I had a rupture in the
lining and the saltwater leaked out and

76
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:19,040
got over the floor and we had a wine
and cleaning it out and doing a bunch of

77
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,900
different things to fix it.

78
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,450
New Tank from folate lab,

79
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,600
float lab technology and so this
all this shit on the ground.

80
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:27,434
It's all just songs,

81
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,930
Yolanda and all that.

82
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:31,040
Now it's kind of boring.

83
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,130
Our cane,

84
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,823
Neil Brennan,

85
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,400
thank you very much for
being on the Poncho,

86
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:43,980
man.

87
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,260
Pleasure was all mine and
get you into the isolation.

88
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,061
It's in Venice.

89
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:48,894
I'm going to call him for you.

90
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,840
It'd be an awesome thing for
you to sit and think of ideas.

91
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,150
There's no environment like that on the
planet where you don't feel your body

92
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,510
disconnect from your body and
you're all inside your head.

93
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,380
It's amazing.

94
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,213
Pretty close to,

95
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,490
I'm just walking around,

96
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,490
I'm so in my head,

97
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,390
but I,

98
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,930
I'm a,

99
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,380
I'm a,

100
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,550
I'm a human isolation.

101
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,510
Well in your head,

102
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,310
in your head there would be no,

103
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,450
I'm fucking here.

104
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,860
When does it kick in?

105
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,521
Well,

106
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,010
it depends on how relaxed you know,

107
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,150
how much you can let go.

108
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,510
It takes a while to get comfortable
with the experience cause it's so weird.

109
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,280
I feel like I would cry.

110
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,503
Does that make sense?

111
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,373
You might cry.

112
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,580
Have you ever cried?

113
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,270
Not In there,

114
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,103
but in real life yet.

115
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,790
You have several times.

116
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,773
Wow.

117
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,750
Oh no more than that.

118
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,963
No person.

119
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,271
No,

120
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:35,110
I didn't cry your nap.

121
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,740
No.

122
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,480
It takes up more than a
cartoon to get me to cry.

123
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,200
Brown.

124
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,110
A little bit of tears.

125
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:40,751
Excuse me.

126
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,141
First of all,

127
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,240
it takes three d and live action.

128
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,040
I kind of titanic like a
motherfucker should really?

129
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,080
Wow.

130
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,520
That's twice I cried cause I
paid $7 for that piece of like,

131
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,490
did you really like titanic?

132
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,410
Do you know what I liked
about it when they were,

133
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:56,740
uh,

134
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,630
they did the flyover of the ship.

135
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:01,450
When you look at the people walking
and it's cause it's old CGI,

136
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:03,470
they like still robotic.

137
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,403
Yeah.

138
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,010
I enjoy that about it.

139
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,600
That's my favorite part of titanic.

140
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,120
When everything looks fake like it.

141
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,830
I thought it was a dumb
move and I liked it.

142
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,340
I liked it.

143
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,810
I like the Capri.

144
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,410
I would like it if it was just the thing
crashing into the water because the

145
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,460
special effects were awesome.

146
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:19,983
Other than that,

147
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,853
no.

148
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,930
You didn't like when he stenciled her,

149
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,150
I would.

150
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,431
It probably,

151
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,000
that would have been that.

152
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,670
Right,

153
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,900
right.

154
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,560
And I liked that she was naked and still
like that was nice that you can think

155
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:29,650
it.

156
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,380
That's what an awful double
standard the MPA has.

157
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,640
Is that like she was
tasteful naked right now,

158
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,820
but she's still naked.

159
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:37,420
I don't give a fuck.

160
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,070
I still saw a woman's netball.

161
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,090
Did you see her nipple?

162
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,880
Yeah.

163
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,000
I think I even remember whatever happened.

164
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:43,834
That chick,

165
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,160
she turned into a meet Bob Wright and she,

166
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:48,580
no,

167
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,031
she's all right.

168
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:49,650
She got big.

169
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:49,891
She didn't,

170
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:50,400
she got you.

171
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,233
That's good.

172
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:51,880
Actually.

173
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,950
Probably smaller than
she was then Barilla.

174
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,380
Yeah.

175
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,990
Didn't she go meet bomb
for a little while though?

176
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,490
The Internet will agree with me.

177
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,800
Christina Aguilera meet bomb.

178
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,250
Wait,

179
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,380
if you say anything negative about a lady,

180
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,520
the Internet will agree.

181
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,240
Right,

182
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,073
meatball or

183
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,830
Kirstie alley and what a hog.

184
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:09,664
Right.

185
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,560
Whenever you ever look at her.

186
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,394
When she was on cheers,

187
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,243
she was so hot.

188
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:13,720
Shit.

189
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,200
Aye.

190
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,230
The her first episode of chairs
when I thought I was like,

191
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,421
damn,

192
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:18,280
like he's kind of big.

193
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,720
She was a little big from it.

194
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,400
He or she was wearing leather pants.

195
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,870
I remember she was like purple leather
pants and it's one of those acids where

196
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,510
you just go,

197
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,250
I don't,

198
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,850
I think that's you don't like,

199
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,790
it's too big for me.

200
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,650
Uh,

201
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,950
I like a size three.

202
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,120
I mean not that is,

203
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,830
I don't need this.

204
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,740
That's how manly I am.

205
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:36,851
I don't know.

206
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:37,571
I just made that up,

207
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,380
but uh,

208
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,213
I don't like it.

209
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,090
I like a nice ass.

210
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,470
Got a great story about Mark Coleman.

211
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:44,560
He was in the UFC heavyweight champion
or hanging out once in a strip club.

212
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:45,300
We had this girl said,

213
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,851
I was laughing.

214
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:46,300
He goes,

215
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,800
she's only about 90 pounds.

216
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,350
And then he goes and puts,

217
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,193
it got to be tight.

218
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,370
That's how he was.

219
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,330
He was breaking it down.

220
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,980
She don't know nothing about
so you can't have a loose,

221
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:59,440
but say at that at that way class.

222
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,640
He figured and he's a gorilla.

223
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,953
Just got tagged or

224
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,413
looking at rabbit.

225
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,290
Yeah,

226
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,190
they're all over the place out here.

227
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,480
Coyotes,

228
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,560
coyotes at night amount nine killed
someone's dog out here even a couple of

229
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,110
years ago and when people
are still talking about it.

230
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,113
Can I have your buddy?

231
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,310
We're here live with
monster brawny monster vine.

232
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,240
Just got to in the pot.

233
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,200
Got done doing the podcast
for the first time.

234
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,641
That was cool.

235
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,091
That was fun.

236
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:26,920
Thanks for having me.

237
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,760
Thanks a lot of fun.

238
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,371
It was great.

239
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:28,941
It was interesting.

240
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:29,990
We got to talk all kinds of shit.

241
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:31,490
International politics.

242
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,580
We went deep deep to the
Middle East by the way.

243
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,550
Iranians not have her ups.

244
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,340
Okay.

245
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,750
Remember that important shit.

246
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,220
I don't like to be called Arabs.

247
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,790
Yeah man,

248
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,660
that's very important.

249
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:42,860
I'll track you down and cut you.

250
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,970
And Moz has a podcast with her other pal
al magical that's been on the podcast

251
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:47,601
several times.

252
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:48,381
And Chris Spencer,

253
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:49,730

254
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,930
And you go to a minivan,

255
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:55,370
men.com and you can check that out and
people can catch you on Mazda brawny.com

256
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:55,730
right.

257
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,301
I'm everywhere,

258
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:56,500
man.

259
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,630
Find ways forever.

260
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:58,750
Each other man,

261
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,010
boy.

262
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,610
But several years I uh,

263
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,001
Joe,

264
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:02,660
I remember when I first
started the comedy store,

265
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,550
Joe was just,

266
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,220
you,

267
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,420
the,

268
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,470
you were the man killing it and now
you're killing it here and you know,

269
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,680
um,

270
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,780
the comedy store was a
fun place back in the day.

271
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,673
It was,

272
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,730
it's my cuts can't go back.

273
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,010
I first remembered Mazda's name all the
time because every time you saw him you

274
00:07:20,011 --> 00:07:21,060
would always sing his song.

275
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,133
Joe,

276
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,663
Joe,

277
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:24,963
I don't know why man.

278
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,750
I think Joey Diaz,

279
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,030
Diaz Joey would come in during
my sets in the middle of my son.

280
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,770
Just start singing.

281
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,220
I would cut.

282
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,053
I was just,

283
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:33,730
Oh,

284
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,563
it's mine.

285
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,950
When Joey stopped coming
to the comedy store,

286
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,180
that's one of the things that killed it.

287
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,960
She always stopped coming six months
before the I got kicked out of their nose.

288
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,870
When he stopped coming here,

289
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:47,171
I was like,

290
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:47,621
God,

291
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:48,161
like what is right?

292
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:49,430
He just fucking hated them.

293
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:49,720
Yeah.

294
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,080
It would just go by the fuck are we
doing coming to this fucking shit or get

295
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:53,914
angry at you.

296
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,480
Come down and store and
get the fuck out of here.

297
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,640
That fucking place.

298
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,683
Yeah.

299
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,270
It was a magical time there.

300
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:04,000
Man flew off the wall the other day.

301
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,660
They have head shots on all the
walls and the other day it just,

302
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,390
I guess flew off and cracking the pieces.

303
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:10,720
Right.

304
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,450
We went through a magical era.

305
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,480
There's an era of us and you and me
and Ari and Brody and trip to Tripoli.

306
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,370
There's an error that we went through
those those years of like the early two

307
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:24,500
thousands yeah,

308
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,350
those a fun era and a lot of
good comics came out of there.

309
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,560
It was a good time for comedy
there and it was a good,

310
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:32,251
there was some nights,

311
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:32,550

313
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,050
Saturday nights there was
packed and it was fun.

314
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Look at the lineup and it was you and
Aaron k there and truthfully in me and one

315
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,481

316
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,210
and Ari and Joey.

317
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:45,601
It was like,

318
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:45,871
man,

319
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,160
those were fun times.

320
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,510
Those were fun times.

321
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,060
That place.

322
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,260
Yeah,

323
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,120
I guess there's a new
wave of good guys there.

324
00:08:51,121 --> 00:08:52,640
Now keep hearing.

325
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,561
Yeah,

326
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:53,770

327
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,870
it's so it goes,

328
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,800
that's how it goes.

329
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,410

world of stand up comics roster.

jinx before you got here,

339
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,090
but we've had the chinks
of having two guys on.

340
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,040
So it's four people in the podcast and
everybody talks over everybody and we'd

341
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,700
have to disaster and twice
it happened accidentally.

342
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,270
Twice.

343
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:21,720
One Guy,

344
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,100
one time a guy brought his girlfriend.

345
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,180
We know he's doing his girlfriend.

346
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,320
His girlfriend started talking.

347
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,041
None time.

348
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,930
A guy brought a a ride and this
ride happened to be a comic.

349
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:29,281
So he said,

350
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:29,401
well,

351
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:30,960
sit in and it became a disaster.

352
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,800
But you sir,

353
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,700
we're not a disaster.

354
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,573
Thank you very much.

355
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,680
Good talking to you.

356
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,760
It worked out well,

357
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,331
Russell.

358
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:37,310
You're the fucking man.

359
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,520
It's almost you're too young fellow.

360
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,630
I left you a book and a DVD.

361
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,710
You can ignore them as much.

362
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,210
I'm going to read your book,

363
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:42,421
man.

364
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:43,800
I'm going to find out
about your childhood.

365
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,240
I want to find out what
makes Russell Tech.

366
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,560
You'll find out it's all in there.

367
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,431
It's all in there.

368
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:48,190
Did you really write it?

369
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,350
I heard this rumor that your brother,

370
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,363
my brother wrote it.

371
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,230
It's written in the front
of my brother wrote it.

372
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,780
It won't take long drives and
then we would Hebrew record,

373
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,880
but we just talk and then he
would just text whatever I said.

374
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,451
Oh,

375
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,284
that's smart.

376
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,710
And really funny because
in the opening thing here,

377
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,560
she family,

378
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,750
he was lifting you to do interview.

379
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,953
Uh,

380
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,180
thank my brother for writing this because
if I wrote written it would have been

381
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:15,780
a flyer.

382
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,390
I'm actually writing my book
and it's a lot of God damn work.

383
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,460
There's a lot of work to sit there in
front of that and it was like my bro,

384
00:10:21,461 --> 00:10:22,470
who knows me better than my brother.

385
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,033
They were brother,

386
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,393
sister.

387
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,140
She wouldn't do a good job.

388
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,310
One of our heads,

389
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,130
no brother

390
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,440
inside wonder buy your child.

391
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:35,440
Well,

392
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,271
you've got to be brothers.

393
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:37,104
I have to know everything.

394
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,363
What's your middle name?

395
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,150
James.

396
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,983
Nice.

397
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,070
Dominic.

398
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,990
Dominic Russell.

399
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,800
And you're the Italian.

400
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,150
I got the fucking Italian middle name.

401
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,700
Ridiculous.

402
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,650
How'd you get down the middle man?

403
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,670
A Godfather?

404
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,803
Yeah,

405
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,670
100% Indian.

406
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:51,451
Do you have other shit in you?

407
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,800
Both my parents are from India,

408
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:54,480
but we're kind of mixed with the British.

409
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,780
The British interest says they
were fucking us for 400 years.

410
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,673
Nice.

411
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,360
And he was the richest
country in the world.

412
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:02,850
Tell the British got there until when?

413
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:03,684
When the British get there.

414
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:08,710
But in the 16 hundreds Jesus Christ even
apologizing blink of an eye as far as

415
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:11,310
the universe goes.

416
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,290
So 400 years ago you guys were dominant.

417
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,080
Spice was one of the richest
countries in the world.

418
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,280
He had all the spices,

419
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,690
spices and gold and jewels that fun.

420
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,740
That's what when Columbus came to America,

421
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:23,491
that dumb fuck.

422
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:23,661
Dot.

423
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:24,540
He landed in India.

424
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,970
They were trying to do,

425
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,720
I do a joke about that.

426
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,021
Why do they,

427
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,670
when they call natives Indians,

428
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,760
because I fucking retard
was looking for my people.

429
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:33,960
I said,

430
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,191
I said,

431
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:35,220
what are you doing on Columbus Day?

432
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,690
Drive around until you don't
know where the fuck you are.

433
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:37,524
Anyway,

434
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,111
it's true.

435
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:41,640
I mean you had to talk
about the GPS stuff.

436
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,503
It's Columbus Day,

437
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,780
how bad navigation was and how little
they knew about what was out there in the

438
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:46,410
world.

439
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,240
They thought they were going to
drop off the edge of the earth.

440
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,430
They thought that they can get to
the point there was in the ocean,

441
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:51,870
wouldn't have a drop
off and that would be,

442
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,770
they fucking took a chance and
they got all the way to America,

443
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,090
you know,

444
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,230
and thought they were in India,

445
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,340
like there were so off.

446
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,580
They weren't even really an American.

447
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,381
They were in The Bahamas.

448
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:05,240
Right then they went to
The Bahamas was first.

449
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,120
Yeah,

450
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,870
the somewhere and then eventually slowly
figuring out a way to poison the entire

451
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:11,704
country.

452
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,370
It's true.

453
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,203
Here we are,

454
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,380
California,

455
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,940
2011 live in like a doctor that's meant,

456
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,900
just bought a fucking
Rolls Royce convertible.

457
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,050
It was,

458
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,720
he used Oh nine oh nine 7,000 miles on it.

459
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,633
That's a good move.

460
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,400
How's your coating?

461
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,080
It's still got it,

462
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,770
got rid of it.

463
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,603
Really sold it.

464
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:28,990
Who bought it?

465
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,823
What else killed him?

466
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,870
Did I tell you a story?

467
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,770
I was driving it on the highway.

468
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,930
It was going 70 80 miles an hour.

469
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,910
Get home in my driveway.

470
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:40,990
I pull into my driveway and
I hear cut and my car liens,

471
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,080
so I get out and the suspension
has detached itself from
the frame and the wheel

472
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:49,360
is stuck in bent into the
front fender and I'm like,

473
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:51,670
that could have happened 10 minutes ago
when I was in a highway that would be

474
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:52,270
dead,

475
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,200
so I got it all fixed.

476
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:56,160
I got everything repaired and I
got the shifts pension redone.

477
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,451
No,

478
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:57,610
no chip just designed it.

479
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,700
Chip Foose just designed it
and a guy named Troy Japan.

480
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,940
Yay.

481
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,510
Built it.

482
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,620
Then I got a guy out here,

483
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:03,371
Steve Stroke.

484
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:04,210
He fixed everything.

485
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:05,280
Did read to the suspension.

486
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,133
I sold it.

487
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,960
Got a Porsche gt three what?

488
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:08,471
What?

489
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:09,460
What does that it?

490
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,830
It's in the garage fool,

491
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
so I'll show him.

492
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:12,754
See you.

493
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,493
Yeah.

494
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:21,250
[inaudible].
