1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,600
Nothing destroys bullshit like marijuana
and when someone's bullshit and your

3
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:06,080
high like,

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,291
oh,

5
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:07,550
come on man,

6
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,810
don't even say that.

7
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:10,100
Right to stop.

8
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,510
Like it's so obvious.

9
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,590
This is not true.

10
00:00:12,591 --> 00:00:13,401
This is not a true thing.

11
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:14,234
It's a lay man.

12
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:14,900
Is that,

13
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,681
Oh God,

14
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:16,270
it's everywhere.

15
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,300
There's a number of honorary miss and
telling me two plus two is 18 I'm like,

16
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:21,230
what the fuck are you?

17
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,420
Stop making all this noise cytology 10
about people in la that already aren't

18
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:27,830
used to being told no,

19
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:28,641
you're wrong.

20
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:31,640
What you're saying is
just worship hauled on it.

21
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:31,941
Right.

22
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:32,480
You know,

23
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,230
or how about this,

24
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,160
you're lying.

25
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,233
Stop lying.

26
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,100
It's a little bit of that going on.

27
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,120
Oh my God,

28
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,650
it's unbelievable.

29
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:39,861
You know,

30
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:41,150
one of the things I
was saying to a friend,

31
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:44,450
we're talking about one thing that
I don't like about people that are

32
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:45,284
struggling,

33
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,790
especially struggling as actors,

34
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,520
it's the arena that they're
forced to compete in the arena.

35
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,370
They're forced to compete is an arena
where they're constantly going to

36
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:56,330
auditions where there's this weird
social thing going on where there's one

37
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:57,310
person who's in control,

38
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,910
the casting director and is a director
who's observing you and your whole thing

39
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:05,960
is about getting these people to like
you quickly in a brief amount of time.

40
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,260
And so they adopt like really obvious
democratic left wing sort of tendencies

41
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,700
and things to say and they adopt,

42
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,230
you know,

43
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,450
a very left wing mindset because that's
the majority of the people in Hollywood

44
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:22,220
are the left wing and they start spewing
out shit that they think people want to

45
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:26,320
hear as opposed to having a real
thoughtful opinion on something that's,

46
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,350
that's a very good point.

47
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,670
Very few people have the luxury of
having a real thoughtful opinion.

48
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:33,620
It's all about getting
someone to like you.

49
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:36,170
It's all about getting
into the door and it's so,

50
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,401
so true,

51
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:37,760
man.

52
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,800
Terrible weight of thinking
about that the other day.

53
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:40,730
That is so true.

54
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:41,564
That becomes this,

55
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,780
this way.

56
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,520
You have to,

57
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,030
you have,

58
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,130
you're bullied into
speaking a certain way.

59
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:46,881
Cause if you don't,

60
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:49,910
you're going to be considered
a shithead or you know,

61
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,900
not on the team man.

62
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:52,570
You don't know the tone of the team and,

63
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,690
and you see it all the time.

64
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,370
Well the left wing aspect of it is

65
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,133
kills ideas.

66
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,961
Jimmy Schubert,

67
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:58,990
I forget what he calls her love.

68
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,040
She calls herself a,

69
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:00,810
you know,

70
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,580
a liberal conservative or whatever
because he wants to work in show

71
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,063
each human.

72
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,040
He could never go to an audition
with a Mitt Romney shirt on.

73
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,440
There was not a single fucking
person would ever hire you.

74
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,270
That's something that they would really,

75
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,040
it would prejudge you for sure.

76
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,420
Let me go get this Guy Outta here.

77
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,401
That is a hard game though.

78
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:18,941
Acting man.

79
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:19,751
I know there was a,

80
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:21,430
when I lived in that
building and Korea town,

81
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:24,100
there was a actor guy
that lived in my building.

82
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:24,851
Uh,

83
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:25,290
you know,

84
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,910
it's starting to get up there in age for,

85
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:28,090
for an actor or whatever.

86
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:30,910
And I guess his was work kind of dried up.

87
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:31,744
And uh,

88
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,910
for some reason when I would see this guy,

89
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:35,620
he would tell me
everything about his life.

90
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,480
For some reason he thought we were,

91
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:37,900
you know,

92
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,470
whatever.

93
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,011
Great friends.

94
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:40,780
I told the guy very little about me,

95
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,440
he just would always just spew all
this information about himself.

96
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,330
And I remember him telling me,

97
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:49,780
cause it was a bar downstairs in that
building and him telling me one night the,

98
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:49,931
uh,

99
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:51,760
I'm getting out of show business story,

100
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,050
I loved the,

101
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,130
like you and I were talking about it,

102
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:56,410
never even considered stopping doing this.

103
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,041
But like,

104
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:57,601
so I,

105
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:59,140
it kills me when somebody gives,

106
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,150
I'm getting out of show business,

107
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:01,980
speech,

108
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,130
I've given my all

109
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,091
and then,

110
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:07,560
uh,

111
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,650
all the phone is,

112
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,700
he said the guy,

113
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:10,170
he,

114
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:10,360
he,

115
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,700
you know,

116
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,810
cause nothing had gone on for men
and worked in a couple of years.

117
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,960
And then he got this
little roll on Deadwood,

118
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,403
like say I don't,

119
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,710
maybe one line or he,

120
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,100
you know,

121
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,330
he was on a horse or something.

122
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,613
And then like,

123
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,311
uh,

124
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:24,761
and you know,

125
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:26,260
that rejuvenated his spirit.

126
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:30,490
But I remember the guy telling me sometime
after that that this girl had dumped

127
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:32,020
him and he's just,

128
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,430
he's just incredulous.

129
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,660
He can't believe it happened.

130
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,190
And he just keeps saying to me,

131
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,970
but I was on deadwood and Whoa,

132
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,573
like who?

133
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,840
Who could dump me?

134
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,970
I was on this town allows you to
reinvent yourself and reinvent,

135
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,590
invent your own reality.

136
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:49,920
Man,

137
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,753
it's a crowded,

138
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,350
we not wanting to be involved
in life with someone who people,

139
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,671
people do that.

140
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:57,180
All the mud thing to say.

141
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,220
It was another time where there was a
little cafe on the corner and he was a,

142
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,960
it was like a sunny Sunday or something.

143
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:05,070
He was sitting in front of their reading,

144
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,730
the big Sunday newspaper and
he had the homes section.

145
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:11,320
He's looking through and I'm
just being a smart ass night.

146
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:11,840
Um,

147
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,060
you know,

148
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,760
I walk up to him,

149
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:12,911
I like,

150
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:13,744
oh,

151
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,420
your career must be doing really well.

152
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,500
Now if you're looking at the,

153
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,620
at the home section and he looks
up from his paper and he just goes,

154
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,640
no,

155
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,600
just daydreaming.

156
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,630
And you know what I'm going to do
one day when I can afford a house,

157
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,070
I'm going to build walls so high to
keep the shit in this city away from me.

158
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,523
Oh,

159
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,910
like the most venomous,

160
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,961
very high.

161
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:33,501
That anger.

162
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:33,771
I'm like,

163
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:34,820
it's a sunny Sunday.

164
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:35,651
Loosen up your talk.

165
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,590
You know what you don't so hard.

166
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,473
I got a great story.

167
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,150
This is Phil Walden.

168
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,960
Separate all this come from,

169
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:42,461
I knew a guy,

170
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:44,300
my acting class and you
know how long I was smacking

171
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,970
in class years.

172
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,680
I loved it by the way,

173
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:48,700
for a lot of reasons.

174
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,450
Mainly because it was
just fun to be in just,

175
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,270
there was a lot of craziness and
Joe would always make fun of me.

176
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:56,110
But there was a guy,

177
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,003
really good guy,

178
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,963
normal guy.

179
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,220
So I thought and he was,

180
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,230
and I hired him to shoot
me to shoot this audition.

181
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:08,980
So I go to his house and he's got this
great camera and on his wall is a dream

182
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:11,860
board and on his wall is

183
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,890
his,

184
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,410
no,

185
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:13,631
no,

186
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:13,740
no,

187
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,060
no.

188
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,710
He's put his face,

189
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,970
he's put his face on the cover of
vanity fair and those magazines,

190
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,310
he's got slogan's saying you're the guy,

191
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,740
you're the one and it's a dream board.

192
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,331
And it was big.

193
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:29,661
It was good.

194
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:31,220
Covered his whole wall man.

195
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,110
And he's a good guy and he's like,

196
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:34,100
he's a normal guy.

197
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:37,550
And a lot of ways he's just been
told the wrong things is Jay Davis.

198
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,881
No,

199
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:38,714
it is not cheap.

200
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,050
I love,

201
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,030
that's almost like,

202
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:41,211
you know,

203
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:43,940
go to a girl's house and she's got
too many stuffed animals on the bed.

204
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:45,540
That's like the male equivalent.

205
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,360
He thought he showed me so much to him
even though he was trying to visualize

206
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:52,340
his future and it never,

207
00:05:52,341 --> 00:05:52,610
I,

208
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,180
I've never gone,

209
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,481
oh,

210
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:55,460
it's never gonna happen Bro.

211
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,771
Say Jay Davis,

212
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:58,610
Jj was very nice.

213
00:05:58,611 --> 00:05:59,444
He's a great guy

214
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,940
to Jay.

215
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,140
So enthusiastic board.

216
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,840
Yeah.

217
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,800
Is just an enthusiastic guy
who's just loves everybody.

218
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:10,520
But,

219
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:10,970
but uh,

220
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,100
this guy handsome,

221
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,120
tall,

222
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,600
you know,

223
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,480
suave and just like,

224
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,231
you're a Dork,

225
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:18,531
bro.

226
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:20,690
I got to help you take
that down right now.

227
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,980
See his picture,

228
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,110
his face over celebrities faces on
Vanity Fair and people magazine.

229
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:27,944
I'm not kidding.

230
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,370
He can visualize himself doing that.

231
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,430
Dane cook a big,

232
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,411
well,

233
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:34,244
I don't know.

234
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:35,890
Chose,

235
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,250
stop bringing behaves it.

236
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:40,610
You're going to run into that guy and
he's not going to have made it and he's

237
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,270
going to go,

238
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,680
you're the reason I'm not getting,

239
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,653
or

240
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,370
he's a good guy.

241
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,960
The best warm.

242
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,010
I love the guy actually.

243
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:49,701
He's a great guy.

244
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,534
It's just nuts.

245
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,630
He was told what happens sometimes is
people are told something enough times and

246
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:59,060
they forget to stop and think.

247
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,760
It's exactly what you're talking about
with the Fox thing is like who says you

248
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:03,190
can't swear and why are
you doing with somebody?

249
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:03,620
Why is it,

250
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,590
why are you doing with a court?

251
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,350
You forgot the idea of a podcast.

252
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,610
You have to keep thinking because you'll
make choices sometimes because you're

253
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,080
told that this works.

254
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:12,530
Yeah.

255
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,610
Who Shed it works.

256
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:17,560
I can't visualize running pumps back
in the NFL are fighting in the octagon.

257
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,710
Don't have it.

258
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,230
No matter what I do and can happen,

259
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,650
I'm getting fucking knocked out cause
my bone structure or for a thousand

260
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,210
reasons I don't have it.

261
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,960
Okay.

262
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,680
Tried,

263
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,513
didn't work.

264
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,500
So you know you've got to,

265
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,480
yes you should dream big,

266
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,780
but you should also be
realistic with who you are.

267
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,520
So when you say someone told him that
all you have to do is use the power of

268
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:41,351
positive thing.

269
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:42,080
Correct.

270
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,550
Use the ideal age thinking
the law of attraction,

271
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,540
all that shit.

272
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,560
And what happens when you read books
about it and it's written enough.

273
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,720
You seen a book's written,

274
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,120
you start to go,

275
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:54,290
this must be this.

276
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,340
This is a truth.

277
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:05,190
Okay.
