1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,670
No,
you don't look very fat to me.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,920
Describe.
I wouldn't say that's a fat guy.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,440
It feels good.
You would definitely say stocky.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,300
I wouldn't say you're fat either.
Right now.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,870
I wouldn't say you're a fat guy.
I know you're wearing layers right now.

6
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:18,480
I'm wearing layers.
You're weighing in so you're trying to

7
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:19,410
dehydrate.
Yeah,

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,780
because you.
You kind of came in late to the game.

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,610
He sandbagged me.
This butterfly since August and

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,680
November.
He says,

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,320
Hey,
let's do a weight loss challenge to 40

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,240
to 56 at the time.
I'm like,

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,730
okay,
that's a little bit of a Bert Ism

14
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,730
though.
Bert.

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,350
I don't know if you know his birth prone
to exaggerate slightly.

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,380
It's called hyperbole.
He was 2:56 on Thanksgiving after a full

17
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:47,920
binge.
That wasn't his walk.

18
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:50,040
It was a bit.
It was a New York binge where I drank

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,800
everyday on opiod radio drink every
single night and then came back and he

20
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:56,220
weighed himself and then I like.

21
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,750
I was a full binge already said to me.
He's like,

22
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:00,360
there's nowhere to 44.
I got on because that's what bonds was

23
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,820
on November 11th.
That's where my special and showtime

24
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:04,620
came out and that's what we weighed in
the car.

25
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,380
It was the day I show you the next day
at the end of the world podcast.

26
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:08,191
Right.
What did you think?

27
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:09,840
I wasn't eighth though.
I didn't.

28
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,210
I didn't check.
I was robust.

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,560
You were pigs.
That was big.

30
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,840
That a gut.
Now why?

31
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,920
What made you guys start this story,
but actually that's already made the

32
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:22,320
challenge,
but I was thinking about the origin of

33
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:26,630
bird is fat because you get the other
dicks.

34
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,450
Hashtag your mom's house.
Here's an example.

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,420
The other kids,
when you did like them,

36
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,800
that's where I was at your mom's house.
You wonder where this hate filled

37
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:45,440
fucking podcast comes from a is where it
came from

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,810
watching a movie.
Do you remember a few years ago the head

39
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,430
of the International Monetary Fund,
Dominique Strauss Kahn was the scandal.

40
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,383
Yeah,
yeah.

41
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,730
Yes,
that's right.

42
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:06,110
He was accused of raping the eventually
cleared and inspired a movie that I

43
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:10,490
think was on hbo or showtime and we were
watching it and they did it like loosely

44
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:13,850
or mostly based on that story,
but it wasn't a biopic and the guy that

45
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:18,851
played dsk was Gerard Depardieu and
there's a scene where they have him get

46
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,470
arrested and do the perp walk and then
they do the strip search like at rikers

47
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:28,610
island and he had this totally bloated,
distended,

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
like big boobs body and we were like,
that looks like burt,

49
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,530
but like,
but bigger,

50
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:37,130
like way bigger.
So then we talked about it on our

51
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:40,520
podcast and then people started to
photoshop burt onto.

52
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,290
I did not get.
I was actually taking it as compliments

53
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,020
because I know he's very talented actor.
I was like,

54
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,651
I was like,
oh,

55
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:49,390
that's cool.
Okay,

56
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:51,520
this is all blindsided me.
This is happening in their little

57
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:54,760
fucking world where they're just.
And then at the same time I started to

58
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:56,080
Vlog.
Remember when I did my blog,

59
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:58,990
Jamie and I and I knew that one of the
things was popular.

60
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,120
Blogs was weight loss.
So I was car care,

61
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,640
like watching my weight loss and I was
losing weight,

62
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,610
but I was always weighing in in a speedo
and it was very self deprecating.

63
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:09,510
I was trying to make it funny.
These two are watching at this at the

64
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,550
exact same time and making fun of how
fat I am.

65
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,580
I'm oblivious to this,
I'm oblivious to all of this.

66
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,060
And then one day Doug Benson and I get
into a fight.

67
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,070
I remember,
I think everyone knows what I'm talking

68
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:21,701
about here.
Yeah.

69
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,550
That was,
uh,

70
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,460
on his podcast,
right?

71
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,400
There was a live podcast.
It was very uncomfortable and it was

72
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,160
bad.
And I think I spoke to.

73
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,900
I called Tom.
I went right to the bar after it.

74
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,910
I was fucking worked up.
I was like,

75
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,730
I think I called him.
I was drunk and I go,

76
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,480
I go,
whoa.

77
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,230
He goes,
hello?

78
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:38,561
I go,
hey,

79
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:39,430
we need to talk.
And he goes,

80
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,490
I'm so sorry.
I go for what?

81
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,670
And he goes,
wait,

82
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:46,504
what are you calling yourself?

83
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,910
I go,
Doug and I had a blow out.

84
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,990
He goes,
oh,

85
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:53,824
nevermind.
Then

86
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,550
wait,
what are you sorry about?

87
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,730
And he's like,
you haven't been online,

88
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:58,930
have you?
And I said,

89
00:03:58,931 --> 00:03:59,764
no.
And he goes,

90
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,170
all right,
let's talk about what you're upset

91
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:03,550
about.
And then after we're done,

92
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,340
go online and I just want you to know
Christina and I are very sorry I will

93
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:09,580
make this stop.
And so I go online.

94
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,960
It is trending,
bird is fat and it's.

95
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,400
And by the way,
and this is the very beginning of it and

96
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:21,880
I have to be very clear and honest about
all of this emotion because there are

97
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,130
parts of this that are like trigger
warning.

98
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,550
But like it was funny as fucking shit in
it.

99
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,610
You couldn't get mad at it because it
was all their best fans making hilarious

100
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:36,880
fucking jokes.
One Guy had took the name burnt Chrysler

101
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,300
and made a wet his own fucking profile
for it.

102
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,640
And we made a website.
He registered a website,

103
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,740
by the way,
by the way,

104
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,740
I saw him in Hartford.
He's obese,

105
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,910
he's obese,
enormous.

106
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,820
And he just sat in the front row the
whole time going burt's fat burns fat.

107
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,980
Next day his mom shows up,
hey buddy,

108
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,370
your mom's morbidly obese.
And the first word she asked me is why

109
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,180
you so fat burt?
She has five bills.

110
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,410
And she said,
why you so fat?

111
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:02,921
Burton?
I'm like,

112
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:05,440
Oh my God,
this is getting out of fucking control.

113
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,010
So he heckled you not,
not Hagel.

114
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,660
He was being funny as I hit the stage
to.

115
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,090
Yeah,
like as I walk on stage half guys goes

116
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,800
Wiseberg fat,
like they yell at.

117
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,250
Ari and I went were in Calgary,
stampede.

118
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,590
And when I got on stage,
all they were yelling is birds,

119
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:23,040
fat burns fat.
Why you so fat white?

120
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,840
And red is like already said,
two things mean that night.

121
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:26,680
He's like,
I've never seen that.

122
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,870
And then at the end I was like,
I'm not telling the machine.

123
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,310
And they started booing and are just
like,

124
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,900
dude,
you got to tell the machine every

125
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:32,770
fucking time.
I was like,

126
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:33,460
yeah,
no shit.

127
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,120
I,
this,

128
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,650
my career has gotten out of fucking
control.

129
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:37,330
I have no control.
I'm fat and I got to tell the fucking

130
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:38,920
machine.
And so then then,

131
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,140
then here's the crushing story.
If you don't know,

132
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,470
it's a crazy story that go to the go to
the one that's on facebook that went

133
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:45,790
viral over the weekend.
Yeah,

134
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,590
12 million views over the weekend that
the machine story.

135
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:52,330
I told her special.
Our special health goes over the weekend

136
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,840
on facebook and shit.
I was telling Tom Marketing companies

137
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:57,030
were calling going like,
Hey,

138
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,310
was your secret?
Yeah.

139
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,520
How did you strategize this?

140
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,250
I put up a good story.
It was Fox and like 10 people that are

141
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:08,300
popular online retweeted it.
So what's really cool about the little

142
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,290
sidebar from this,
but real,

143
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,480
what's really cool about this,
which I think you'll get a kick out of

144
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:13,880
Joe,
is you guys heard me tell that story for

145
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,850
years ago on this podcast.
I think half the people everyone likes

146
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,140
to have.
People thought it was a lie.

147
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,240
Know other people go,
I don't give a fuck.

148
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,590
Some people are like,
I bet it is true.

149
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,610
The reason it went viral,
I think is that people in my class

150
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,450
tagged in the comment section.
This story is 100 percent true and

151
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:33,890
posted pictures of the entire trip
through the comment section so you can

152
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:37,280
see what Igor looks like.
You can see what Sasha looks,

153
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,230
you see the whole,
you see us that night on a train,

154
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:40,730
drunk as fuck with the two gangsters.

155
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,070
All those were in the comments section
and so everyone that's ever heard the

156
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,560
story lost their shit.
Like,

157
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,950
dude,
I got messages.

158
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,780
Like one guy was said he was cancer and
this is the best thing that's ever

159
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:52,520
happened with terminal illnesses hooked
up to deal with.

160
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:53,660
Thank you so much.
And I'm like,

161
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,830
Dude.
But anyway,

162
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,690
that's a sidebar to this where you go to
the facebook,

163
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,400
my facebook page.
Anyway,

164
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,670
one morning I wake up,
now I'm dealing with what is,

165
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,640
what bill burr is,
does references fat shaming and quote

166
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:09,500
unquote taking on water and I am fat.
And I wake up with panic attack at four

167
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,610
in the morning because I've been
drinking.

168
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,020
And uh,
I go on my,

169
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,860
my wife's friend's instagram and her mom
passed away.

170
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,690
Mom hasn't been hospice.
You know this one,

171
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,530
right?
Oh my God.

172
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,720
So sorry for your loss.
I'm,

173
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,950
we'll see later today and then one tom's
fans and my fat.

174
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:31,970
I guess rights in the next comment.
So sorry for your loss.

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,110
Did burt sit on your mom?

176
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:38,961
Next is.
Hey,

177
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:41,140
if you keep her cold,
halitosis

178
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,150
brutal.
Like Brandon and comes over the house.

179
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,060
She had lost her mom,
lost her mom in the middle of the

180
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:52,670
fucking night and her first words to me
are.

181
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,620
I'm sorry,
what's happening to you online?

182
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,730
Do you remember when you went to the zoo
with the girls?

183
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,960
Want to talk about fucking bizarre.
I actually face time.

184
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:06,830
Him and I just,
it's a random call middle of the day.

185
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,800
So we answered and he's in public and I
see him while he was like,

186
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:11,280
hey man.
And I already did.

187
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:13,150
I said I'm here with.
The girls were talking about the bird is

188
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,300
fat Thomas Shirts.
He's like,

189
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:15,230
I'm gonna.
Make these shirts.

190
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,470
I'll put them on my website.
We'll split the profits.

191
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:18,440
Yeah,
just whatever.

192
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,990
Just I'll just tell them on site so we
can split the profits.

193
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,950
We can track and I'm like,
cool,

194
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:22,190
cool.

195
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,770
I see like his daughter walked by,
so I'm like,

196
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,030
oh,
these people that he's,

197
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,250
you know,
maybe his sister is there with them and

198
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:32,350
then someone behind them is like,
burt's fat is bad.

199
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,050
And I'm like,
yeah,

200
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,740
like I've figured it's like a friends of
friends,

201
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:38,630
mother or something.
And then later he's like,

202
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,760
no,
it was right.

203
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:41,180
Then it was right.
Then it was right.

204
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:44,720
Then I turn the phone around and I go,
I'm talking to Tom Segura right now.

205
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:45,411
And she goes,
oh,

206
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:46,400
shut up.
Hi Mommy.

207
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm a big fan jeans or whatever the fuck
they say,

208
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,200
but here's the other part that went
crazy buzz after we.

209
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,990
First of all we had,
I did a,

210
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,060
I did press in Syracuse,
I think,

211
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,880
you know,
when you do morning tv and they go,

212
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,400
what do you want us to lead you with?
And it's always like,

213
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,440
you know,
comics will be like asking me about

214
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:07,950
birds.

215
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,120
I got a great thing,
you know,

216
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:13,710
and like they want like a bit.
So I was just like asked me why Bert

217
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,940
Kreischer so fat and thinking,
because most of the times they go like,

218
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,140
oh,
I don't know about that,

219
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,400
you know,
they don't want to get racy.

220
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,990
And The lady just goes,
okay,

221
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,910
so
we're just in the middle.

222
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:27,281
And she was,
oh,

223
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:28,920
I got to ask you something.
And I go,

224
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:29,670
what's that?
She goes,

225
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,060
why is Burke Chrysler so fat?
She said it wrong.

226
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,890
And by the way,
Tom doesn't make a joke out of it.

227
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:35,281
He goes,
well,

228
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:37,810
he's an alcoholic.
He's got a lot of problems.

229
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,440
And so we play that on the podcast and
we go ask.

230
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,020
The whole thing was asked birth,
why he's so fat.

231
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,060
So why are you so fat?
What I didn't realize,

232
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,170
I thought that like 100 people would
tweet it to him.

233
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,550
I didn't know that they would destroy
his instagram,

234
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,080
facebook,
like troy to the point where I had to

235
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:00,480
tell my daughters,
you can't read this like it's bad,

236
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,110
but I've never blocked anybody.
But then Joe,

237
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:05,970
he says this,
there are these people out there that

238
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:08,610
are fucking broken,
a really hateful things and you're like,

239
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:09,990
hey man,
I'm all about a good time.

240
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,880
Yeah,
you can make fun of me all you fucking

241
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:14,640
why ticket?
Like I tweeted some guy today that I

242
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:15,540
forget what he said.
Oh,

243
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,220
he goes,
to be honest with you,

244
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:19,260
I think both of you guys are winners in
this challenge.

245
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:20,370
Congratulations,
by the way,

246
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,300
Bert,
you're still fat.

247
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,300
And I just thought I was on the
treadmill and I stumbled and sort of

248
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:25,930
laughing and I went,
there's ones like that,

249
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,270
that they're out there that are fucking
great.

250
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:30,030
There's some funny ones and I also,
I remember I called him when I thought

251
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:30,720
it was too much.

252
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,180
I go,
I'll do a thing now where I say it.

253
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,230
He's like,
absolutely,

254
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,440
you're not my fucking mother.
Do do that.

255
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,010
Do that.
But coming out the structure of going,

256
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:39,750
he has asthma.
Stop picking on him.

257
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,340
I was like,
I'll take this on the chin.

258
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,330
But that's when we started to go
competition though.

259
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,100
That's when already stepped in.
Oh yeah,

260
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,960
yeah.
Because you know red has no fucking

261
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:49,790
heart.
Ari who,

262
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,620
who's in Kuala Lumpur right now?
Yeah.

263
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,620
He,
uh,

264
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,191
where he is,
right?

265
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:54,430
We don't know where he is.
So

266
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,460
he had this podcast and amazing podcast
with Henry rollins.

267
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,340
Henry Rollins,
once a year gets on a plane,

268
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:04,080
he talks to his travel agent and he
goes,

269
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,610
where can we go?
And she's like,

270
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:06,780
have you been to Burma?
He's like,

271
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,440
nope.
So he flies to like Burma and knows no

272
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:15,441
one brings a laptop and a notebook and
some underwear and just fucking wanders

273
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:16,644
around.

274
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,780
He gets a hotel room and he just goes
out in the street and just goes there

275
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,080
during the day.
And at night he writes,

276
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,030
no,
not oppressed.

277
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,000
I've traveled the fucking world.
Let me tell you something.

278
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,010
Everywhere is the same.
Beaches were beaches,

279
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,590
fucking hotel rooms,
bedrooms hammered everywhere you go.

280
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,690
But I also have an insulary fuzzy Ivan,
insightful fucking eye.

281
00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:36,900
And like,
trust me after,

282
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,010
after a week,
you're like,

283
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,750
okay,
this is getting old.

284
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,970
Is there a four seasons around here?
Like I can't.

285
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:46,770
I think it gets a thrill of Henry
valance legitimately enjoys it.

286
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:48,570
If you listen to that podcast that he
did,

287
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:52,380
it's an amazing podcast because he just
talks about the people that he's met and

288
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:55,360
all the experiences that he's had.
Maybe Henry rollins a little deeper than

289
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:56,320
I am.
I am a guy that like,

290
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,450
I want to go to a bar and meet a bunch
of people and hang out and have a good

291
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,010
time.
I'm not like sitting there going,

292
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,910
Whoa,
what is their,

293
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,220
their spice here?
It seems very dominant.

294
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,420
Like I'm not that guy that,
that ice cube way something put it back.

295
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,950
He's just got to suck on an ice cube.
But,

296
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,910
but the only thing I've been doing it.
Let's get these fucking wanes over.

297
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:14,410
I'm fucking,
we'll get to that.

298
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,290
What kind of timeline are we talking
about that this all started?

299
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,500
So after the Ra podcast,
which was November seventh,

300
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:27,100
I'm guessing basically that's this year
though.

301
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,420
Yeah,
basically two months.

302
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,960
So this is.
Yeah,

303
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,040
it's basically.
So when,

304
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,240
when did you start losing weight though?
You started losing weight before that?

305
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,340
August.
August.

306
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:36,730
And what,
what made you decide?

307
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,520
Um,
I think part of it was that we had been

308
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:42,960
doing all the fat talk like I,
when did the fat talk start with my

309
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,800
assistant started definitely in the
summer.

310
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:48,130
I remember listening to your podcasts or
it had to be early then it had to be

311
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:49,380
like may or June.
It was,

312
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,110
it was easily may Miss Syracuse.
Yeah.

313
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,470
Because I remember in July in Alabama
and I was jogging and I was listening to

314
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:56,890
you,
um,

315
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,310
push fucking destroy me and I could not
stop laughing because it was,

316
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,630
I think it was me talking on phone.
You guys taking everything away.

317
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,810
The funniest thing that I have seen from
this so far is that a lot of English as

318
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:15,130
a second language teachers around the
country have sent in videos where

319
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:17,140
they're like in India,
Japan,

320
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,220
China,
and they a lot like an alarming amount

321
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:24,340
of English to second language.
They put a camera in the room and as

322
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:27,130
they're teaching the kids,
they teach them to say Burt Chrysler is

323
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:27,964
fat.

324
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,010
We have tons of these videos where the
kids are like.

325
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,540
And also like one lady was like,
draws like it's just a fat guy on a

326
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,630
chalkboard and she was like,
this is burt and the kids go,

327
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,870
this is burt.
And then she's like,

328
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,180
he eats too much and they're like,
he eats too much.

329
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,850
They go through the whole thing.
See,

330
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:54,160
he's got a teammate.
I'm doing this fucking Solo.

331
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,600
It's true.
It's true.

332
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,520
My wife,
my wife got involved.

333
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:59,020
She fucking hates this weight loss
thing.

334
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,530
Does she?
Oh Hey.

335
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,490
Like I would say that I'm going to
desert me Tom and push you up to go to

336
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:05,590
dinner and apologize.
What do you call her?

337
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:07,650
Push.
Because her last name's it.

338
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,370
And when we first met,
always done that.

339
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:12,040
I'm never good with Christina's and
Tina's and Christians and I'll just call

340
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,230
her push,
push,

341
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:13,760
push.

342
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,720
I love it.
She's one of my favorite.

343
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,530
Literally my favorite couple of.
I was ever going to be like a,

344
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,430
like a,
a side husband.

345
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,280
I'd be in that couple.
Okay.

346
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,830
I don't think I can react to that.
I don't think I would have had as much

347
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:28,840
fun doing this with anybody else.
You know?

348
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,670
That's what a lot of people don't
understand is that we're,

349
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,320
we're best friends and so when I did the
podcast with bill and Tom,

350
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:36,850
people started shitting on Tom and I was
like,

351
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,111
no,
no,

352
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:37,960
no,
you're blocked now.

353
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,920
I can't if you don't like me,
if you don't like Joey Diaz feeling

354
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,400
like,
or even only joe if you don't like Tom,

355
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:45,490
I don't like you at all because you
don't get me because these guys are my

356
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:47,410
friends.
And they'd find my foundation of what I

357
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:50,220
find funny and what I get.
So like that was one of the things that

358
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,190
got shitty about this is that you'd find
people being like,

359
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,210
fuck Tom's girl.
And you're like,

360
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:55,750
no,
you're always going to get that right.

361
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:56,181
Yeah,
yeah.

362
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:57,490
The people.
Some people got like,

363
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,320
they got the spirit of it wrong,
I think,

364
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:01,100
you know,
and they were like,

365
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,870
that guy's a fucking piece of shit.
And you're like,

366
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,010
well,
we're like,

367
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,360
we're doing weight loss.
Like fuck.

368
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,800
What's going to.
Probably some of your fucking videos

369
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,460
have been amazing.
I love the video you do.

370
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:16,260
And when you were playing credence,
let the midnight special.

371
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,110
That is a fucking great video and
drinking a cup of coffee and then you

372
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,370
get on that treadmill.
And then the other one when you're

373
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:28,371
showing that you did five fucking hours
and 20 minutes on the Treadmill,

374
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,540
you ran 22 fucking miles burned off.
3,000.

375
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,750
How many calories?
3,000.

376
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,840
Three thousand.
300 calories today.

377
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:40,800
I did a bet that I made though.
I know I knew that burt would do this.

378
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,940
He's good.
He's crazy.

379
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,850
He's crazy.
And take on it.

380
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,560
I knew that you were going to be like
steady.

381
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,390
I'm like,
Tom's not going to slip up.

382
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:50,760
He's not going to say fuck it.
I need a cheeseburger in the middle of

383
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,070
the night now.
But burt might not eat for a month.

384
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,080
Yes.
Like you might go straight.

385
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,540
What the fuck's his name?
The Batman Guy.

386
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,160
What's his name?
Christian Bale.

387
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:01,200
When he was in the machinist machinist.

388
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:06,760
The name of my tour to machinists.
That's the name of my tour.

389
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:09,510
Everybody.
Berger Chrysler is the machinist.

390
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,740
Do you,
will you send it to me one night like,

391
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,660
you know,
like you go,

392
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,250
you go stop drinking,
stop drinking,

393
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,240
and you go,
Tommy's looks good,

394
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,410
trust me,
and then you're like,

395
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,900
I don't know man.
You got that crazy thing is I call it

396
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:23,710
the Mickey Mantle gene is that guy that
can go out party all fucking night long,

397
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:26,560
get up at eight,
get on the field and hit a walk off home

398
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:28,510
run.
Is that John Daly gene,

399
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,390
that kid,
that gene,

400
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,870
that babe ruth gene,
we eat the hot dog and left field and

401
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:33,820
then catches the fly ball.
That's what I've always,

402
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:37,160
I've always admired that in athletes and
stars is those people who can go off

403
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:40,210
until tiger woods when he's got the
blown out knee and a bad back and he

404
00:16:40,211 --> 00:16:41,530
drains the 90 foot putt.

405
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,360
That's what I don't like.
The fucking Phil Mickelson's over here

406
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,310
is Phil Mickelson drive up the middle
230 yards.

407
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,670
Looks like a little five iron.
I'm fucking going for the green every

408
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:54,760
time you go and that's the way,
but it's not healthy.

409
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:56,560
I've had,
I've had no joke,

410
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,780
no joke,
and anyone that's seen me on the road

411
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,780
noses less than a thousand calories
every single day.

412
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,420
Um,
I've dranken only vodka sodas and I've

413
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:08,020
run at least five miles a day every day,
every day.

414
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:12,930
Except for yesterday I had,
I had for dinner the night before when

415
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,870
we were weighing in tomorrow.
Guess what he had for dinner?

416
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,700
What?
Pulled pork,

417
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,980
Collard Greens,
and black eyed peas.

418
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,160
It's a tradition that every,
every New Year's Eve we showed her the,

419
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,830
the Black Guy,
the Collard Greens are for money.

420
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,410
I've done it every year and I've made
more money every single year that I've

421
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:33,660
eaten it.
I'm not going to stop it.

422
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,660
Here's the other thing too,
man.

423
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,260
Technically I know going into this,
I should lose this challenge because I

424
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:45,010
knew I was bigger and I knew that,
that he could,

425
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,010
if he wanted to be disciplined,
I thought he would,

426
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,980
but I,
I was betting that he wouldn't be

427
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,440
disciplined.
That's the bet.

428
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,210
What you,
you were bigger when it first started.

429
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,970
When I first started,
I knew that like physiologically to

430
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,710
like,
uh,

431
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,270
I just,
I think I have said a little bit more of

432
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:01,300
a disadvantage,
you know?

433
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,750
What are you saying joe?
Is when he started fat shaming me,

434
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:08,751
he was fatter than me.
Maybe something about that term.

435
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,670
You said that that term you think is a
good term.

436
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,620
I,
I mean I just said that,

437
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,950
that personally for me,
fat shaming like worked well.

438
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:21,420
I just feel like that like when somebody
is,

439
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,680
it's more like just being honest.

440
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,670
It's like not in denial when somebody
goes like,

441
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,030
hey man,
you need to lose some weight.

442
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,740
And someone's like,
that's fat shaming.

443
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:29,251
I go,
well,

444
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:30,720
yeah,
I think it's just someone being honest.

445
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,280
You know,
that's a bullshit term.

446
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,420
I really do that fat shaming me.
Only it only works if you're fat,

447
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,040
you're fat.
You should lose weight.

448
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,280
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

449
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,440
It's,
I have a weird.

450
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,320
I have a weird push and pull with it
because there was a period where I

451
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,850
didn't like it.
I didn't like I,

452
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:47,280
I empathize with.
I'll just say amy,

453
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:48,880
because she's the one that gets fat
shaming most.

454
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,700
Hernan,
Kesha are the two most fascinating

455
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:53,790
people in the country,
one of the best rock stars ever.

456
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,760
She's the best of the best rock star.
So right now,

457
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,620
one of the best rock stars ever.
Dude,

458
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:04,140
Kesha,
die young is one of the best rock stars

459
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,710
ever.

460
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,310
She's more than a pop star.
I mean,

461
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,080
she'll get at it and we can't see you
over.

462
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,470
And you dehydrate your brain to the
point where it's misfiring.

463
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,550
Kesha eat an ice cube.
I,

464
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,630
I'm waiting for fucking way in,
so I'm going to hydrate soon.

465
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,860
We're going to.
It's going to happen soon.

466
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,843
So,
uh,

467
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,420
so cash and amy are getting fat.
Shamed.

468
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:26,070
And I would read their comments.
[inaudible] I was going through

469
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:28,680
something similar.
Not Similar because I think most of mine

470
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:29,700
were in fun,
but man,

471
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:34,230
they say they say some mean shit to amy
and Kesha where you're just like,

472
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,540
why say that?
And then I get some of those and I go,

473
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,231
hey,
yeah,

474
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:39,120
there was a point where like one morning
you wake up,

475
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:41,580
you're not in the best mood.
And you check your instagram comments

476
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:42,990
and you're like,
oh fuck,

477
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,600
this is not the way I want to start my
day.

478
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,310
However,
I will say,

479
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,910
had it not been for the fat shaming,
I wouldn't have lost.

480
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,160
I'm going to guess I've probably lost 30
pounds.

481
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,870
You do definitely look better and feel
better,

482
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:55,590
right?
Dude.

483
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,300
Way To light.
Take off these lower layers.

484
00:19:57,301 --> 00:20:02,150
I look so I feel so much better.
I feel I did.

485
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,400
I jogged eight miles today.
Like I just like.

486
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:07,540
That wasn't happening when I was 2:50
south thanksgiving.

487
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,200
Go outside or go on my treadmill that
everything's on my treadmill.

488
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,410
I get in,
I'll watch one of those raw workout

489
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:16,110
videos and get inspired.
The rock dude,

490
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,110
his workout videos are fucking awesome.
Do not follow them on instagram.

491
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,270
He's the best suit when he hit me up.
Do you?

492
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,490
Does anyone remember this day?
In my life

493
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,240
I post.
I work out in the rock shirt.

494
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:29,380
I always have the rock shirt on.
Which was the bowl?

495
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,720
No,
it's the under armour shirt.

496
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,590
Oh No,
they're not out yet.

497
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:32,730
They're coming out soon and I'm getting
all of the.

498
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,100
Oh Geez,
you have A.

499
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,340
I have a man crush on the rock,
but also in it's a part of this thing is

500
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:41,700
finding inspiration to work out that
credence clearwater thing that's real.

501
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,410
That's what I do.
I play that great,

502
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:44,640
good.
And then you get on the thing and you're

503
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:45,151
like,
fuck it.

504
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:50,151
Let's just start running.
Paschal shine a lot on me.

505
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,600
It of just the rock.
Anyway,

506
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,480
I would wear a shirt and I would.
It would,

507
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,720
I would do videos for the rock to see
and in the process I'd workout and

508
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:02,530
workout because I'd want the roxy and
then he saw one and he was like,

509
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,750
I've made a video where I made a line.
I was like,

510
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:05,584
uh,
you know,

511
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,360
the fight is.
I go,

512
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,340
I've today,
I'm doing two a days.

513
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,230
For those of you who didn't play
football in high school,

514
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:13,540
two days for those of you who didn't get
pussy back in high school,

515
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,550
two days and what?
As bad as it did it put hair on her

516
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:19,540
balls and loved it.
And he goes that today's lion had me

517
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,200
rolling and then he goes,
team Bert.

518
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,040
I lost my shit,
but then I called him.

519
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,210
I go,
you never.

520
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,970
You never did two a days and he was.
I know I played baseball.

521
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,910
It's been the fucking funniest.
Have you guys seen Andrew Sandino's bit

522
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:35,860
about the rock.
Now that's who it is.

523
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,370
I was trying to tell somebody that I
heard about somebody who has an awesome

524
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,090
fucking hilarious.
It's hilarious.

525
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:45,490
I want to see it.
I don't want to say any of that to

526
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,560
understand.
Tino came up on my podcast last week,

527
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:48,820
oddly enough.
He's got red hair.

528
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,680
Yes.
Yeah,

529
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,050
yeah.
I want to see that joey on my podcast

530
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:54,420
tonight.
Good luck staying sober way and it's

531
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:57,560
going to be tough tomorrow.
Deaths.

532
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,400
He was on the podcast yesterday.
We did a UFC fight.

533
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:02,420
Recap with Joey.
He's the best.

534
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,790
He was at my house for fucking Christmas
Eve was destroying my dad.

535
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,920
Did you see the video data,
medical.

536
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,820
He says he did.
We.

537
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,370
It's undisclosed because my dad passed
out hard as fuck and Joanne just walked

538
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:16,390
out.
Codes are dosed.

539
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,390
Mr K and let me do it before though,
didn't he give him some popcorn before

540
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,480
warm one time at Easter time.
The video is so funny of of Christmas

541
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,560
Day with Joe and and Mr. crusher smoking
and laughing and trying to stop that.

542
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,520
He's like turning to people like he's
just laughing so fucking hard.

543
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,790
I robbed this fucking Puerto Rican and
my dad's a lawyer.

544
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,810
My Dad's going,
Joey,

545
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:44,110
Joey,
my dad loves joey.

546
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:46,750
I literally,
I called Joey like day before Christmas

547
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,021
Eve.
I was like,

548
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:48,160
you're coming over right?
And he's like,

549
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,650
this is what I love about Joyce.
No fucking bullshit.

550
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,060
He goes,
what time?

551
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,310
Five o'clock.
See you then cock sucker.

552
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,350
And his daughter is like the perfect age
for my daughters to feel like they're

553
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:01,950
doing something good.
They chase her around.

554
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,510
Horrible.
You guys are like real close to each

555
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:04,890
other.
Right?

556
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,740
And then when we start to get broken in,
but homeless people play this

557
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:18,270
real was this
nice little fire pit.

558
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:23,270
Did one thing killer was fucking around
with Hammond and I'm a kid.

559
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:26,500
I don't know if he's throwing him up in
the air

560
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,023
that mother fucker.

561
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,210
What you were saying,
you just say homeless people broke in

562
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:36,110
your house.
Yeah.

563
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:36,944
Yeah.
A

564
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,460
chunk out of my face
with

565
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,610
the
fucking crazy

566
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,393
Christmas Eve

567
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,233
court.
Yeah.

568
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,870
Yeah.
You told me that story that someone was

569
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:06,650
walking down your driveway,
some homeless for two to experiences and

570
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,400
because of the construction because
construction and Joe.

571
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,860
Louis,
Joe.

572
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,560
He's the Kinda guy and this is just the
thing.

573
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:15,410
You didn't say a thing?
Just dog or drop by your house every

574
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,000
night at home.
I drive by just checking to make sure

575
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:18,650
everything's okay.
Every fucking night.

576
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:20,750
When he's coming home from the store,
she just drives by my house.

577
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,580
He's a great guy.
He's the greatest man.

578
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:24,040
He really.
Should we weigh in.

579
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,090
Let's wait.
Let's do this now.

580
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,090
You started out at what?
Wait,

581
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,701
wait,
wait.

582
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,140
Before you.
Before you started,

583
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,320
you started in August,
right?

584
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,920
What were you at your heaviest to?
60 seven.

585
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,240
Holy Shit,
dude.

586
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,980
Yeah.
You were closing in on three.

587
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,080
Holy Shit.
You were to 67.

588
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,730
Wow.
How'd you feel?

589
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,620
I'm not good,
man.

590
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,200
I mean I didn't.
I can't say that like I woke up and they

591
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:45,620
go,
ah,

592
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,400
feel it.
But I was,

593
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,450
you know,
I was still.

594
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,800
Here's the thing,
at my heaviest,

595
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,900
I would still lift weights a couple of
times a week.

596
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,000
I still would,
I would still do squats,

597
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,200
still do power cleans,
but I was just eating recklessly,

598
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,320
like whatever I wanted.
I was at his house,

599
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,940
I went to dinner at his house,
me and Leanne,

600
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,740
is it their old house?
And uh,

601
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:09,140
it was right after they had the baby and
Tom cooked us each a steak,

602
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:12,680
like a full rib eye and then we each got
like nine shrimps and then we each got a

603
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:16,610
slab of potatoes and then we got a whole
stack of Greens and we didn't need it

604
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:17,990
all.
And Tom ate at all and he was like,

605
00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:18,800
you didn't like yours?

606
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,700
And we're like,
no,

607
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:22,150
it's me.
It's a meal for like three people like

608
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,993
that everyday,
you know,

609
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,830
I mean that's how you get to 60 seconds.
So I just felt like,

610
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,170
you know,
and then honestly like clothes too,

611
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,390
it's so something you don't think about,
but you'd be like,

612
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,760
oh I want to get this shirt and you put
it on,

613
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:36,110
you're like,
you have a bigger shirt.

614
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:37,940
And they're like,
we don't make bigger than that.

615
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,990
That's the biggest.
And I was like,

616
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,670
man,
you go to gap.

617
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,130
And they're like,
do you guys have forties?

618
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,190
And they're like,
we don't make forties.

619
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,520
And you're like,
oh,

620
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:46,280
so I've got to shop at a different store
now.

621
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,400
Yeah.
Like this is something I think that has

622
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:50,720
been in the base of every.
This is.

623
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:55,460
I also did a showtime special shirtless
during this entire fat shaming campaign,

624
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:59,220
which did not help what you do every
show shirtless part of the NIH.

625
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,780
Not to like to deflect or whatever.
Part of the reason I started doing a

626
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:05,990
shortlist as I didn't look good in
collared shirts and like I couldn't wear

627
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:08,960
a tee shirt and so I just,
I just kinda stayed to rip my shirt off

628
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:10,520
and I was,
I was a little fat.

629
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:13,250
I was like 2:50 to 60 now.
People just thought it was funny and I

630
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:14,540
just leave it off.
I didn't give a fuck.

631
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:18,110
And then when I like let this weekend I
took my shirt off and I'm not,

632
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,430
I'm not skinny by any stretch of the
means,

633
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:22,970
but I'm not to 60 anymore to 50 and it
did not get,

634
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:25,310
just was flat lined and I was like,
okay,

635
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,790
looks like the shorts going back on for
now on the machinist is wearing shirts,

636
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,790
the machinist is going to wear a shirt
machine is the new bird.

637
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,210
So wait,
so to 67 and on our challenge day I

638
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:36,770
would say I was 2:45.
Right.

639
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:38,930
So wow.
So you had already dropped like 20

640
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:39,650
pounds.
Um,

641
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,660
what did,
what did you start at on our challenge

642
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:42,291
day?
I set out,

643
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,520
I just thought it was two,
five thinking that it wouldn't turn into

644
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:47,820
a base set to 40.
I said 2:40 the machinist,

645
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,060
but uh,
but on our,

646
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,130
when I got home on the day after,
when I got hold of me you go.

647
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:59,140
I was actually to 50 to 50 the day when
I started and I was 56 when I started

648
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:01,650
the Diet,
the I started that I was Thanksgiving to

649
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:06,651
56 and that that's the probably the
highest I weighed in ever that I saw

650
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:10,230
myself on a scale to 56.
And so the goal weight was around like

651
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:13,800
two slash 22 slash 27 slash 27 meant
the,

652
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,000
the,
the deal was this,

653
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,750
whoever is the lowest weight when they
texted me the winner.

654
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,140
But if we're both 2:27 or under,
then the,

655
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,010
the burden of paying for things,
it's supposed to go to Ari.

656
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,810
Oh.
So if you go,

657
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,010
whoo,
I like that.

658
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,410
Yeah.
So does he pay for both trips?

659
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:32,041
Yes.
Well,

660
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:32,540
no,
no,

661
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,300
we,
we,

662
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,940
we pick one trip.
We pick one trip but already pays for

663
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:37,620
the tickets to the trip.
Oh.

664
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:38,910
So,
but how do you choose what trip?

665
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:40,800
Because if you win you're going to super
bowl.

666
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,840
Well,
I'll go to the eye to.

667
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,480
Oddly enough I'm in,
I'm in Europe when Tom's talking about

668
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:47,070
that game.
So I'd go to that game in a heartbeat.

669
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:50,190
I would explain that if you win,
if I won,

670
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,240
I wanted him to take me to A.
Barcelona is playing a Paris nature main

671
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,610
round of 16 European cub game.
Uh,

672
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,970
so we would go to,
we would go to Paris.

673
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,430
And you told me initially that you
wanted to go to the superbowl.

674
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,170
So I thought it was.
Yeah.

675
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,160
Yeah,
I'd go to Paris jokes.

676
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,440
I'm going to be in London filming or no,
no,

677
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:08,690
just taking the girls.
Oh,

678
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,840
awesome.
I'll make a lot of money.

679
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:10,850
So,
uh,

680
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,110
so,
um,

681
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,470
so Ari will pay for that.
He'll,

682
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:25,200
he'll fly you guys to already be there.
I just need the ticket.

683
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,213
Yeah,
take it.

684
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,660
You should make the flight.
Yeah.

685
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,400
You need to meet us.
I say,

686
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:32,370
man,
he's off the grid.

687
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:33,480
Is he going to come meet us?
Yeah.

688
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:35,310
Why not?
You won't even know how to get in touch

689
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:36,144
with them.
I don't know.

690
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,440
He probably doesn't have a phone
anymore.

691
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,440
It was based on our BMI.
So when we gave him our original BMI

692
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:41,940
versus our height,
it was,

693
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,490
we were obese and he said,
I bet you can't get into just simply

694
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:47,700
overweight and it's simply overweight.
The threshold is 2:27.

695
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,940
So if we got under 2:27,
both of us,

696
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,880
but if one of us today does not get
under to 27,

697
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,740
then that person has to pay for the
trip.

698
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,521
Yeah.
How does that work?

699
00:28:56,521 --> 00:29:01,420
That body mass index because you will,
your body fat or you tied to wait and

700
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,480
it's super outdated and they actually
updated.

701
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:08,100
There's a newer version called the smart
Bmi which took into account also the

702
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,130
fact that more people are just even
bigger.

703
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,320
Like you're obese.
I guarantee you you're obese.

704
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,420
I'm overweight by the BMI BMI somewhere
in my background.

705
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,470
Some fucked a monkey.
Yeah.

706
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,430
Someone,
someone my great grandpa's Day,

707
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:25,170
someone fucked a gorilla.
Something happened.

708
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,130
And so that became the bet.
And if we could get into just being

709
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:31,500
overweight,
which I think personally looking at him

710
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:33,030
and looking and feeling,
knowing me,

711
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,590
I did not weigh into that because I was
scared.

712
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,880
Um,
but,

713
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:37,500
uh,
I think like you there,

714
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,600
I think I'm there.
I think I was there before.

715
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:43,210
I know it was there before yesterday and
then I worked out pretty hard last night

716
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:44,950
and this morning,
but I didn't want to go on the scale

717
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:45,910
because I didn't want to come in

718
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,730
down if I wasn't.
Okay.

719
00:29:47,731 --> 00:29:49,770
So first of all,
let's do rock,

720
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:51,360
paper,
scissors to see who goes first.

721
00:29:51,361 --> 00:29:52,770
Okay.
So Youtube.

722
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,613
Okay.
Ready?

723
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,900
One,
two,

724
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,700
three.
What are you doing?

725
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,560
What you're doing?
Let me do it.

726
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:00,050
I'll do the cow.
I'll do the account.

727
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,560
You guys get your hands up.
Ready?

728
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,820
One,
two,

729
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,990
three.
Gotcha.

730
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,160
Okay.
Burt one,

731
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:06,090
that one,
one,

732
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,953
two,
three.

733
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,640
Okay,
one,

734
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,540
two,
three.

735
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,710
Gotcha.
Okay.

736
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,080
Burt winds.
So would you like to go first or would

737
00:30:13,081 --> 00:30:15,000
you like Tom to go first?
I'd like to weigh in first.

738
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,530
Okay.
I'm so facing thirsty.

739
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,120
So we're going to um,
move over to a toms microphone over

740
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:24,060
there.
You have a wide shot.

741
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,810
We can get the whole room.
We're going to use a camera up there,

742
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,760
so we'll be using that camera up here.
Here we go.

743
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,220
Are we doing this one carpet?
Do we want to take your clothes off?

744
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:39,870
First of all,
you definitely want to take your clothes

745
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,590
off.
Well,

746
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,650
I know it works.
Hold on,

747
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,630
but let's make sure we know exactly if
it's exactly right because it may not be

748
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:49,110
like my scale at home.
I'm always around 200 pounds.

749
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,600
Two.
Oh,

750
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,200
one,
two,

751
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,040
a one with my clothes on.
She was like one night

752
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,880
he's got a rubber suit on the whole.

753
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,603
Oh,
okay.

754
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,120
Okay.
So,

755
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:06,920
uh,
for folks that are just listening here,

756
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,280
we're in the studio here and Jamie is
setting up the camera for Youtube so

757
00:31:13,731 --> 00:31:16,670
that it will point directly down the
scale.

758
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:21,671
Bert is a looking considerably slimmer,
considerably slimmer.

759
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,940
He's got multiple layers on and now he's
down to underwear,

760
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,120
which are probably wet.
He took the first layer of underwear or

761
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,620
socks,
a drum roll.

762
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:35,320
Ladies and gentlemen.
BOMP bomp.

763
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,223
Bomp.
Bomp.

764
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,300
BOMP bomp.
BOMP bomp.

765
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,690
He's drying himself off like a wrestling
tournament.

766
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,760
Jesus Christ.
Okay,

767
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:46,220
here we go.
Below 27 everybody.

768
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,550
Here we go.
Bert Kreischer called out.

769
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,423
Joe

770
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,120
Two 21.
Holy Shit.

771
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,980
Holy Shit.

772
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,620
Oh No.
But it's right,

773
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,510
I checked my own weight.
It's right.

774
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,640
This is what I use at home too.
But we can,

775
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:09,320
we can try with
35.

776
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,770
Yeah.
Thirty four points.

777
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,193
That's it.

778
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,760
Twenty one,
22,

779
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:15,500
21.
Ladies and gentlemen.

780
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,210
Holy Shit.
I mean Shit Joe.

781
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,290
My prediction was Tommy wasn't going to
take his shirt off.

782
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:27,380
He's got to.
Now that shirt is precious ounces to 21.

783
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,330
My man went hard.
Fuck.

784
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:31,560
Yes.
Cyborg.

785
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,250
Oh,
I have my watch on that.

786
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:37,340
So probably at least a few ounces.
That's a good watch.

787
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,870
It's a beautiful watch by them and make
a,

788
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,090
a drink while it's going on.
Oh my goodness.

789
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:45,440
This is.
This is chaos.

790
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:46,400
Here we go.
Tommy.

791
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,560
Looking very slim to.
Here we go.

792
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:49,394
Ladies and gentlemen,

793
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,300
show fuck.
Holy Shit.

794
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,410
Wow.
First of all,

795
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,950
congratulations to the both of you for
that is gigantic.

796
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,090
So Thursday.
It's ridiculous.

797
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,200
We've got some coconut water.
If you want to get some electrolytes in

798
00:33:17,201 --> 00:33:19,270
you.
Holy Shit.

799
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,500
You guys want to coconut water?
No,

800
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:21,550
I'm good.
God,

801
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,590
you might go get water or their calories
in this.

802
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,431
Uh,
no.

803
00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:25,660
None at all.
It's a Stevia.

804
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,740
It's called via sodium Tommy.
Holy Shit.

805
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,340
Wow.
So those extra pounds or whatever,

806
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,250
you know,
you didn't drink water that made up for

807
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:37,100
it.
God Damn,

808
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,550
we got gotta.
Do this all again together tomorrow of.

809
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,770
Wait,
what happens tomorrow?

810
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:45,640
Let's take some moral one.
Victory.

811
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,010
Well here man,
let's sit down.

812
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,880
Let's sit down.
Okay?

813
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:50,050
We go.
We got this out of the way.

814
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,480
Oh my God.
I'm so thirsty.

815
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,850
Wow.
Very impressive.

816
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,360
Tommy,
you went from two,

817
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,270
you say to 67,
two,

818
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,940
six,
seven down to 2:19.

819
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,650
Holy Shit.
That's amazing.

820
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,980
You could see it in your face to Jesus.
You know that video that uh,

821
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,850
I took a still of it and I put it up on
instagram today.

822
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,590
Yeah,
but that one video I was looking at your

823
00:34:17,591 --> 00:34:18,041
face.
I'm like,

824
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:19,930
Jesus,
you look so fucking healthy.

825
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,310
Thanks.
He's busted.

826
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:23,350
Open his food when he got there from
chicken,

827
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,270
little pieces,
a dry chicken,

828
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,170
fucking broccoli and stuff.
I just can't eat today.

829
00:34:29,171 --> 00:34:31,500
I just can have fluid today and then
fucking go to Berkeley.

830
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,990
Sweat it out.
Are you thinking about that?

831
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:38,110
Pulled pork and black ips and all that
jazz.

832
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:39,730
You ate and you think that might have
fucked you?

833
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,541
I think I'm,
I don't know.

834
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:41,740
I think I'm fucking shocked.
Um,

835
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:45,190
to 21 to be amazing.
Amazing.

836
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,170
It's amazing.
You both look great.

837
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,890
You really do your faces like you look
like two different people.

838
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,810
I know.
It is weird.

839
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:56,050
When I saw him we were at all things
comedy of the day and I walked up behind

840
00:34:56,051 --> 00:34:58,800
him and I didn't recognize him.
I go,

841
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:02,140
I go,
you went from the little cuddly chubby

842
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,130
friend I have where we giggle to this
dude who looks like you video tells you

843
00:35:05,131 --> 00:35:06,070
the tapes himself fucking.

844
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,640
But you guys are like,
you're,

845
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,700
you.
You're like,

846
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,330
we'll close to getting down to 200
hundred

847
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,510
pounds.
Do consider this in like 30 days.

848
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,340
Yeah.
You could do you,

849
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:24,430
you both could be 200 pounds.
Yeah,

850
00:35:24,431 --> 00:35:25,480
I will.
The thing is,

851
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:26,121
you know,
I don't want to,

852
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:27,880
like,
I haven't changed my lifestyle at all

853
00:35:27,881 --> 00:35:29,530
technically.
Like I've changed the way I eat.

854
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:31,870
I eat so fucking clean right now.
Like literally,

855
00:35:31,871 --> 00:35:34,630
except for last night,
I've only had lean proteins and greens

856
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:36,940
for every meal I do.
Big Truck in.

857
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,160
You're the

858
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,940
whole comp checks?
Yeah,

859
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,470
hulk loads.
Hope I call outcome.

860
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,570
I do.
I do those shakes like once a day and

861
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:47,160
I'm,
I'm under a thousand calories.

862
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:49,070
My wife,
what's upsetting her?

863
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:51,210
And she's like,
how do we transition this into a healthy

864
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:52,580
lifestyle,
which is,

865
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,810
which is fine,
I think once you get c's right.

866
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,000
Yeah.
And it's like I can't continue this.

867
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,220
No.
Like I had to push back a cardiologist

868
00:35:59,221 --> 00:35:59,731
appointment.
I was like,

869
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:01,610
I don't want them to see me like this.
Like I'll,

870
00:36:01,611 --> 00:36:03,700
I'll wait until I get healthy again.
You know,

871
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,690
this is not entirely healthy to just
drain yourself and dehydrate yourself

872
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:13,500
like chicken so much.
You're like a dog that just got back

873
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:15,220
from the park.
You know what's crazy is it.

874
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,040
I understand I watched Chris Cyborg
breaking like weight loss thing.

875
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,850
Did you see that?
Yeah,

876
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,960
it's horrible.
And I watched it and I thought if I can

877
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:27,810
have half that intensity,
that whole time I watched at the

878
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:28,510
beginning the weight loss.

879
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,360
I said if I gonna have half her
intensity in that moment.

880
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:30,991
What did,
uh,

881
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:32,280
what did she do?
Oh Dude,

882
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,200
she's crying.
It's all made.

883
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:34,771
Wait.
Yeah,

884
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:35,340
yeah,
yeah.

885
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,590
And share bodies apparently really
fucked up from it.

886
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:40,240
She just got,
she is pissed hot for um,

887
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,270
some sort of a.
well,

888
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:45,300
it's really difficult to say exactly
what's going on because what she took

889
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:50,301
was something called spironolactone,
which is illegal in Usada.

890
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,700
You're not allowed to take it,
but her doctor,

891
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:56,040
she says,
told her she could take it out of

892
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,530
competition.
She passed on a bunch of title fights

893
00:36:58,531 --> 00:37:03,330
though the UFC was concerned.
So they tested her and apparently people

894
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:08,200
take that it's a diuretic and a,
what she was saying was that share of

895
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:11,010
bodies all fucked up and hanging onto
water now.

896
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,760
And then she's taking this just to try
to leverage those herself out because

897
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,290
draining herself down to 1:40 was so bad
for her that her whole system all fucked

898
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:19,770
up.

899
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:24,360
The controversy is though that that same
drugs also taken by people who are women

900
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:29,190
who do steroids to mimic,
to minimize the effects of testosterone.

901
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,140
Okay.
So we don't really know.

902
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,690
I mean it's their word.
Who knows,

903
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,790
who knows?
But it's amazing when you watch what you

904
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,740
watch when you're.
When you're focusing on getting in

905
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:38,820
shape,
moving.

906
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,360
I watched this guy rich froning.
Do you know who that goes to?

907
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,230
Crossfit champ,
dude.

908
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:44,740
He is like,
he's a savage.

909
00:37:44,741 --> 00:37:47,880
She has a borderline sociopath.
Like the way he focuses on workout,

910
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,070
working out.
It's just like he's almost dead inside.

911
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,320
There's no enjoyment to it.
It's almost like an obsession.

912
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,950
So I started looking at it like that,
like don't like don't enjoy jogging,

913
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:58,350
just make an obsession.
Like my thing was I get on the treadmill

914
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:00,690
and go just one more mile.
Just do one more mile.

915
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,490
You do that.
Everyone would do one more mile like

916
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,140
tea.
Like this morning I was like,

917
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,240
I was like,
maybe one maybe if you're on this mile

918
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:08,400
at a seven,
maybe that'll make the difference today.

919
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,230
And I just would get obsessive about
that brain.

920
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,630
What's five?
So little things in my body.

921
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:19,800
If I touch that fucking explode.
Just kidding tonight.

922
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,290
Oh yeah.
When my daughters for a little exercise,

923
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,160
I'm looking at it that way.
I'm going to look at.

924
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:24,731
It is fun.
I look,

925
00:38:24,731 --> 00:38:27,660
I was burning calories now.
Uh,

926
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,000
how are we going to do this in terms of
tomorrow?

927
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:31,910
Because you guys are real close.
Yeah.

928
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:37,060
So you are to 19 to 21.
We're only talking about a couple of

929
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:39,130
pounds.
So those couple of pounds.

930
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,240
What if one of you loses more than that?
Tomorrow.

931
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,270
But like what if Bert gets down to like
two.

932
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,370
Oh,
six tomorrow or something ridiculous.

933
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,080
I don't know.
What do we do?

934
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,210
That's a good question.
Average out the to wait.

935
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:57,520
Well we average out the two weights.
It's whoever loses the most overall

936
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,550
or is it because otherwise we're just
going to have a draw or a victory?

937
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:04,420
Right.
Like if you,

938
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:05,770
if you want again tomorrow,
it's easy,

939
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,760
right?
Because you want it today.

940
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,110
But if burt wins tomorrow,
but what if he wins tomorrow by the

941
00:39:11,111 --> 00:39:15,730
exact same amount?
Talking about total weight loss or just

942
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:18,190
whoever's lighter.
We're just saying that like what if

943
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:22,210
tomorrow we come in and you weigh two
pounds less than me?

944
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,071
Tomato,
right,

945
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:27,280
but then like we each one one day.
So you were to 21 year or two?

946
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,040
19.
Correct.

947
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,710
Okay.
So we're really only dealing with two

948
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:30,790
pounds.
That's,

949
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,530
that's so negligible.
I mean that's,

950
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:33,970
that's,
that's uh,

951
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:34,750
a few of these.

952
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,060
Yeah,
I mean you can,

953
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,590
you can suck that out of your body.
That can be done.

954
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,640
So the question is how do you,
uh,

955
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,490
like what if tomorrow Bert winds,
but he only winds by half pound,

956
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,900
right?
When does 10?

957
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:51,160
So I have to win by three pounds.
Well that's what I'm trying to.

958
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,250
We're trying to figure out like how can
you might as well shave my beard right

959
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:57,280
now can get the regrow it started
already.

960
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,170
This is,
it gets kind of dangerous because you

961
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,330
guys are gonna.
You guys are gonna hit that,

962
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,420
that Freakish di you guys take anything
taking any diuretics or anything like.

963
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:08,230
Oh I haven't restarted that.
Recommended it.

964
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,350
So I would say I was your friend
diuretics,

965
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,360
I would say.
Do they happen at the cvs?

966
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,430
Oh yeah.
What happens?

967
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,740
Shit.
Your brains out pits like the fucking

968
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:23,560
race horse shit.
And like three days calories.

969
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,210
Um Man,
this is a,

970
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:30,700
this is where it gets squirrely because
you guys are on the wire.

971
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:33,970
I mean clearly tom one,
but he only won by two pounds.

972
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,990
Yeah,
that's the wire.

973
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:35,040
You

974
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,140
guys can't believe that because I
thought you'd win by thought I thought

975
00:40:39,141 --> 00:40:41,120
I'd wait to 27.
He came in and he's like,

976
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:42,440
I think I'm to 27.
I was like,

977
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,560
oh Jesus.
Okay.

978
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,740
That's marathons running marathons.
Wow.

979
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:49,171
Yeah.
You,

980
00:40:49,171 --> 00:40:51,080
you've been literally doing marathons?
Yeah,

981
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,810
I don't do them all at once.
I break it up during the day so I get up

982
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:55,490
at like six,
have a cup of coffee,

983
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,730
walking like a three point five,
walk a mile in like 17 minutes and then

984
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:03,460
sit down with a computer,
see if I'm trending and see what is he

985
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,101
up,
my facebook.

986
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:07,250
I will abuse all my facebook video and
then get back on and then I'll run

987
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,800
around like two miles.
Then go fuck around with the girls,

988
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:10,970
come back,
get on.

989
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,620
That's the way I do it.
I break it up.

990
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:14,990
So like right now I got eight miles on
the treadmill.

991
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,500
I'll do a podcast with joey tonight,
get back on the treadmill,

992
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,340
Bang on another eight,
and I was 16 miles today.

993
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,430
Wow.
I know you walked in running a mix.

994
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,630
What I'd like to do,
my favorite thing to do is I walk a

995
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,330
hundred yards on the treadmill and then
I run 300 yards,

996
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,250
so like a a run at seven point five over
200 over half

997
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,860
of the lap around the circle so that the
other day.

998
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,630
When you post that video and is five
hours,

999
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,740
was that broken up or to the day?
Starting at 6:00 AM.

1000
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,990
Ending it like probably probably nine at
night.

1001
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,050
Like yesterday I went,
I ran three miles first thing in the

1002
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:49,280
morning,
then went to the rams game,

1003
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,980
put on pulled pork on the green,
big green egg,

1004
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,780
went to the rams game a cooked it 300
degrees perfectly for five hours.

1005
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,010
Thank you.
Eric Rosen.

1006
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,770
When you put it on the big green egg,
how do you keep the temperature stable

1007
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,640
for that long?
You regulate it with the pipe,

1008
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,230
the pipe up top and the bottom,
and you just put Philip charcoals and

1009
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:09,430
once you get it to like 2:25,
if you've got it regulated,

1010
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,630
it's not going to go much higher because
it's not getting much air in and then

1011
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:14,150
slowly the charcoals a burn and then it
just cooks.

1012
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,310
You don't open it,
it just cooks and if you open it all the

1013
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:18,920
way it's going to get way high gets when
you were like 700 degrees.

1014
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:20,090
Yeah,
I've got one of those.

1015
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,280
I have a commodity,
but it's basically the same thing.

1016
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,010
Have you ever tried it with one of those
pellet grills though?

1017
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,630
Oh God,
I wish I remembered his name.

1018
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,830
What's his name?
Brett.

1019
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,470
Brett.
Brett.

1020
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,370
Yes.
I love my green mountain grill.

1021
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,820
I just a new pellet.
So that thing is fucking better than

1022
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:36,260
anything.
You put it in there and you're like

1023
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,630
2:25,
five hours.

1024
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,460
Perfect.
Yeah,

1025
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,870
it stays at that temperature.
What kind of grill is it?

1026
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,970
It's a pellet grill.
What they do is they take,

1027
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,030
you know when you go to flex my home,
my voice.

1028
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:50,000
Did you know if you go to a lumber yard
and they cut up,

1029
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:53,690
saw a hardwood sawdust from the
hardwood,

1030
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:57,500
they take that stuff and they compress
it and the natural sugars in the wood

1031
00:42:57,501 --> 00:43:02,360
allows them to compress it down to what
looks like it looks like a serial or

1032
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,420
kitty litter or something like little
tiny like cylinders,

1033
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,870
little small cylinders,
and they take that and you pour it into

1034
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:12,290
this hopper,
so it's this like large bin and then

1035
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:17,000
there's a worm drive at the bottom that
slowly turns this stuff into a heating

1036
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:21,140
element and the heating element is
inside the chamber of this big steel box

1037
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,340
and the heating element.

1038
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,360
There it is.
You see it there.

1039
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,700
Those are the pellets.
So those are hard wood pallets.

1040
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:27,620
There's no gluing them,
has no nothing.

1041
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:32,621
It's just the natural sugars from the
wood and when you use the machine,

1042
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,900
when you close that lid there,
you get to see it there.

1043
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:42,220
You can regulate the temperature and it
keeps it exactly at that temperature is

1044
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:46,970
low in that,
that popper that'll last for fucking 10,

1045
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,450
12 hours.
Yeah.

1046
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,370
Especially.
It's amazing.

1047
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,710
They're incredible.
And how hot can it.

1048
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:53,230
Can it go full?
$600?

1049
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,480
I have one that is a.
it's a Yoda.

1050
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:00,490
It's like a really good one.
It's like made out of cast iron is real.

1051
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:03,440
Fucking heavy.
Yoder makes these amazing smokers and

1052
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:08,441
mine has a direct heating option.
We you take out that big diffusion plate

1053
00:44:08,721 --> 00:44:12,590
and you put in these grill grates and it
has direct fire that goes right

1054
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:15,800
underneath the grill grates.
I see your stakes on it and I cook elk

1055
00:44:15,801 --> 00:44:18,350
on it all the time to the best.
It amazing.

1056
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,830
It really is.
And you get that smoky flavor to it too

1057
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:24,920
because it's cooking with fire.
It's wood and fire.

1058
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:28,340
So it's got a beautiful flavor to the
food if you don't want us.

1059
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,890
What I do sometimes my daughters don't
like smoked food is all wrapped some

1060
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:32,190
ribs

1061
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,650
up in tin foil and put them in there and
they still cook like an oven.

1062
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,410
An oven.
It's still cooks at 2:25.

1063
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:39,810
And then you smoke to other racks.
Dude,

1064
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,220
it's fucking amazing.
Yeah.

1065
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,080
It's like,
it's like you're cooking with an oven,

1066
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:47,010
but it's all fire instead of gas,
heat or whatever the hell.

1067
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:51,210
Electric heat.
I love it man.

1068
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:52,980
So why did you,
why'd you use the green mountain grill

1069
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,940
instead of the or why'd you use the big
green egg instead of the Green Mountain

1070
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:58,110
girl?
I wanted to see if I could use it.

1071
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,570
I just got it.
My Dad got it for me for Christmas and

1072
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:03,270
uh,
because I like the ritual of cooking.

1073
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,080
Like I like the ritual of like starting
up charcoal and you know,

1074
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:09,330
and then getting it into it.
And then so,

1075
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:14,520
so yesterday I ran three miles through a
pull on these to a Boston butts bone in

1076
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:18,300
Boston butts and then closed it and then
it's made things fun.

1077
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,790
I'm sit at the fucking rams game going,
going like,

1078
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,280
I wonder if the girls too hot,
like,

1079
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:22,910
shit,
fuck it.

1080
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,810
It's like it makes it,
it's like betting on a game.

1081
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,150
By the way,
went to the rams came yesterday.

1082
00:45:27,151 --> 00:45:30,870
I told Tommy with a Jersey that had the
machine written on the back of it.

1083
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:36,410
Oh God never been recognized more and my
fucking life mean dudes were coming down

1084
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:39,510
to my seat going,
hey,

1085
00:45:39,511 --> 00:45:44,280
can I get a picture
back of my shirt is fucking,

1086
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,340
it was a gift from my management company
and it's a Rams Jersey.

1087
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,520
And I was like,
I'll fucking wear it.

1088
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,320
As soon as I walked in the stadium,
big dude goes,

1089
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,730
Shane.
And then I turned around and he goes,

1090
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,960
Oh shit,
it's the machine.

1091
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,390
And I was like,
you just thought it was some dude,

1092
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,980
a dude with the machine on the back.
He was like,

1093
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,420
Domo,
Shane and I turned around.

1094
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:01,680
He's like,
my daughter's like,

1095
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:03,150
dad,
fucking stop it.

1096
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,550
Yeah.
That must be embarrassing for the kids.

1097
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,710
Have you ever thought about getting one
of them?

1098
00:46:10,711 --> 00:46:11,880
Uh,
offset smokers?

1099
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:14,640
We throw logs in.
They're like those old school Texas

1100
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:15,760
style ones.
Yeah.

1101
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,793
Yeah,
me too.

1102
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,940
Put it the back corner by the chickens
and just have like a big,

1103
00:46:19,941 --> 00:46:21,060
uh,
like oil.

1104
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:24,510
Can you just open up?
I love one of those.

1105
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,940
Yeah.
Those seem like that's the real ritual,

1106
00:46:26,941 --> 00:46:28,020
right?
Yeah.

1107
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,710
I had a barrel grill.
You know where you,

1108
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:35,990
you have to take off the greats after
like while you're cooking to keep adding

1109
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,710
coal and wood chips to it,
you know?

1110
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:39,660
Oh,
old school.

1111
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:40,770
Old School.
Yeah.

1112
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,520
Yeah.
There's something about women.

1113
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,570
I appreciate that.
Is that a male thing?

1114
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,440
I think I like working with fire.
So yeah,

1115
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,390
I don't see a whole lot of women.
I know not a lot.

1116
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:54,990
I'm sure that there definitely are,
but it's not like they can't do it,

1117
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,993
but I don't see a lot.

1118
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,770
What the hell is that?
Like what women like to cook,

1119
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,660
but men want to cook outside over fire.
I think it's.

1120
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,120
I think it's primal.
Yeah.

1121
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,860
I cooked up.
You gave me the elk last time.

1122
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,300
Got More if you want.
Yeah,

1123
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:11,460
I do because I haven't heard tomorrow
though.

1124
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,220
I cook it up and I won't getting pieces
of liberty here tomorrow.

1125
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,760
Fuck yeah.
We're getting fucked up tomorrow after

1126
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:19,200
weigh ins.
If I don't have a beard,

1127
00:47:19,201 --> 00:47:21,410
I will be drinking vodka and I'll be
making him drink vodka.

1128
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:23,280
So we bring a razor.
We should.

1129
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,320
Yeah,
but we're the dollar shave club when you

1130
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:27,130
need them.
Either one of my sponsors,

1131
00:47:27,131 --> 00:47:30,190
so I'm very raised.
You didn't need an electric one.

1132
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,560
Are you looking at me last today?
I'll bring upbringings.

1133
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,770
I got clever.
You can shave me,

1134
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:40,690
but we're using my clippers.
Okay.

1135
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,340
Well why don't I already giving up.
I'm,

1136
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:43,660
I'm by the way.
I'll shave you.

1137
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:44,940
Well,
but what?

1138
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,820
You'd have to.
We have to figure out how you can win.

1139
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,130
I thought was just personally.
That is lowest.

1140
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,850
Well he won.
Today is two day way in.

1141
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:56,970
So he went into that.
So if you get lower tomorrow,

1142
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,830
he would have to get lower than two
pounds.

1143
00:47:58,831 --> 00:48:00,250
Lower.
Holy Shit.

1144
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:05,070
Because it has to be.
It has to be a victory overall,

1145
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:05,671
right?
I mean,

1146
00:48:05,671 --> 00:48:06,510
what,
don't you agree?

1147
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,110
Yeah.
No,

1148
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,300
we should let people weigh in on the,
on twitter.

1149
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,740
Don't do that.
No,

1150
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,791
don't do that.
You can.

1151
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:14,460
You tell them too many people on
protocol already.

1152
00:48:14,461 --> 00:48:16,440
Let's call her basement with a dick in
their hand.

1153
00:48:16,441 --> 00:48:19,110
Typing with one hand and not paying
attention.

1154
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,780
Call are just texted me a good luck on
the way in.

1155
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:26,330
So I hope you're not fat or too late.
Yeah,

1156
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,750
I was going to say that at this point.
He,

1157
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:28,320
um,
uh,

1158
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,680
he's already paying for stuff.
Yeah,

1159
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:30,743
yeah.
Oh yeah.

1160
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,583
Yeah.
I'm not gaining.

1161
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,090
Yeah,
eight pounds tomorrow.

1162
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:34,763
Yeah.

1163
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,810
Right now he's trying to figure out how
to unclip his phone.

1164
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,030
Yeah.
Oh.

1165
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,670
Oh.
Oh.

1166
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:44,670
He's still committed to that flip phone.
I can't believe it's a flip.

1167
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,420
Lowman mumbling.
He sent me.

1168
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,720
He's got a mouthful of fucking shoe
laces.

1169
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:54,560
Ari.
Hey

1170
00:48:59,140 --> 00:48:59,973
Ari,

1171
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:07,090
he's talking to someone else in the
answers the phone don't hang up.

1172
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:07,660
No,
no,

1173
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,890
no.
He'll get to you eventually.

1174
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,830
I can't believe this human.
We're friends.

1175
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:16,060
Hold on.
Ridiculous.

1176
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:17,710
Silly.
He's the best though.

1177
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:22,750
I just love what he's done.
Like very few people get wealthy and

1178
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:27,280
like I've known since he was a,
he was a doorman at the fucking store

1179
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:32,700
and he was an open mic or when we became
friends and when he became famous,

1180
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:37,920
one of the first things that fucking guy
did was abandoned all fucks.

1181
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,280
Yeah.
He doesn't have any.

1182
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:41,050
None.
Zero.

1183
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,150
I mean zero.

1184
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,390
Pretty awesome.
Can you hear me

1185
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:17,410
now?
He's in the middle of a podcast.

1186
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,490
He's in the middle of.
It.

1187
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,490
Sounds like gangs podcast.
He already.

1188
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:26,400
Can you hear me?
Sorry.

1189
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:27,860
Do hear me

1190
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:32,450
or you didn't get your money back.
You get the

1191
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:39,340
feeling that he's answering your phone
might be a message.

1192
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:44,230
Yeah.
Let's call him again and see if it's his

1193
00:50:44,231 --> 00:50:46,510
outgoing message,
which is hilarious.

1194
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,590
Texted me.
What'd you say?

1195
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,600
Fuck yourself.
Good luck today.

1196
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:54,860
I've been hoping you win since day one.
That's the same message you sent to Tom.

1197
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:09,500
Let's see if it's the same exact message
because if it is then how funny would

1198
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:11,710
that be?
As outgoing message is terrible.

1199
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,180
Was in the middle of a conversation just
to confuse people.

1200
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,990
Could we use to do that?
Remember?

1201
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,950
Yeah.
I still fall for those again.

1202
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:22,880
Give me one second.
Let me get the deep.

1203
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:29,770
Can we please leave your message for
fear that's not as outgoing message.

1204
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,100
Fuck them.
Let's keep calling them.

1205
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,290
Fluids number tasted better in my entire
fucking life.

1206
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:40,090
I don't know how these professional
fighters do it.

1207
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,530
They get paid though.
Yeah,

1208
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,720
and they're savages.
Yeah.

1209
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,850
Yeah.
It's not easy,

1210
00:51:45,851 --> 00:51:48,170
man.
Hello?

1211
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:49,360
Hey,
you're alive.

1212
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:56,290
Bert Kreischer to 21.
Thompson Agora to 19.

1213
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,050
Wow.
Yeah,

1214
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:04,060
we're on the air right now.
Twenty one to 21,

1215
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:08,980
like a fucking gangster and then tom
gets on it to 19

1216
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:12,940
below obese.
They're both below a b,

1217
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:17,080
so you have to pay for the trip.
You fuck how you feel about that?

1218
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,491
Yeah,
no way.

1219
00:52:18,491 --> 00:52:21,770
Yeah,
you got to measure the measure that.

1220
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,301
No,
no,

1221
00:52:22,301 --> 00:52:23,260
no.
It's my scale.

1222
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:28,310
It's a scale and we put weights on it.
Their heights were both six one,

1223
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,310
six one.
You said you'd pick one.

1224
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:32,900
He's only five percent were the same
height?

1225
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,810
No,
he's not.

1226
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:38,220
He's six.
One was coming out.

1227
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:42,640
It's like you were in the elevators to
the Jew in you is trying to save some

1228
00:52:42,641 --> 00:52:47,641
money
for

1229
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:50,650
nothing.
Six one.

1230
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,780
Stand up.
Stand up please.

1231
00:52:52,781 --> 00:52:53,930
Tommy Tommy,
stand out.

1232
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,870
Okay.
They're going to stand up for them.

1233
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,960
For the both of them to Berta.
They both had no pants out by the way,

1234
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,920
but it looks a little taller.
Maybe not much.

1235
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,350
Maybe a half an inch to.
Well,

1236
00:53:05,351 --> 00:53:06,184
I don't know.
Yeah,

1237
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,780
I would say,
but it's hard because your hair's a

1238
00:53:07,781 --> 00:53:10,120
little flattened up and tom's a little
thinner on top.

1239
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:12,490
Flatten that out.
Flatten your hair down.

1240
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,330
One more time,
please.

1241
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:14,800
Stand up.
Go back to back.

1242
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,780
Let's take a look at this here.
Yeah,

1243
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,750
listen,
it's the difference in height is maybe a

1244
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:23,501
half an inch,
maybe a half.

1245
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:25,890
An inch bar might be a inch tall.
And Burt,

1246
00:53:25,891 --> 00:53:25,980
how

1247
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,650
tall are you?
I'm 61.

1248
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,880
He's six months old.
Tom's probably six and a half.

1249
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:32,310
Yeah,
they're both under obese,

1250
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:33,144
bro.
You lose

1251
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,620
BMI calculator and figure that out.

1252
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,710
Okay.
We'll go into a BMI calculator.

1253
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,930
So we.
Here's the question to you since since

1254
00:53:41,931 --> 00:53:46,520
Thomson one today by two pounds,
we're saying tomorrow,

1255
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:50,780
Bert has to win by more than two pounds.
If burt wants to win overall,

1256
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,010
does that sound correct to you?

1257
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:00,600
Suddenly waiting.
The final cut?

1258
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:02,820
No.
No,

1259
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:07,200
because Tom one by two pounds today.
So Tom has won victory under his belt.

1260
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:10,440
If burt wins by two pounds tomorrow,
it's just a.

1261
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,350
it's a draw.
So he would have to win by more than two

1262
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:16,350
pounds because that's the amount of
victory that Tom got today.

1263
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:21,090
I think they brought sweat a bunch and
this is why we did multiple days because

1264
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,370
tomorrow's Day would be for a little
more,

1265
00:54:24,371 --> 00:54:27,760
but we couldn't do a draw,
but I would say yeah.

1266
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,180
Okay.
So we.

1267
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:35,180
We added their weight up six foot one
and 2:21 for burt in the body mass.

1268
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:38,650
The overall body mass index is 29 point
two two.

1269
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:41,500
He's overweight only.
She's overweight only that's not obese.

1270
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:43,690
Okay.
What about six?

1271
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,490
Six.
Okay.

1272
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:49,450
Let's see.
Let's just go with going to be

1273
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:50,520
overweight.
I've already done this.

1274
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:55,310
It's overweight and we just went with
straight six feet without even the half

1275
00:54:55,311 --> 00:55:00,311
inch and a quarter,
but put me in at five.

1276
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:03,590
10,
put me or a five.

1277
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:07,670
Eight rather
a

1278
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:11,680
Tommy did know.
Obese.

1279
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,250
Look at this.
I'm obese.

1280
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:18,200
Five eight.
It's ridiculous,

1281
00:55:18,201 --> 00:55:19,430
but that's hilarious.
If five,

1282
00:55:19,431 --> 00:55:20,240
eight,
200.

1283
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,190
I'm obese and they're not.
Who's got the lower BMI?

1284
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:25,910
I got a six pack.
Yeah.

1285
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,010
So what do you think?
Do you think that that's how it should

1286
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:28,760
be?
That Tom,

1287
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,160
that bird has to win by more than two
pounds tomorrow?

1288
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,560
Does that seem fair?
Ohio?

1289
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:34,400
And maybe let's see who's got the lower
BMI

1290
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,720
should be the final way because they
couldn't have

1291
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:42,360
any water today.
They couldn't do that two days in a row.

1292
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,120
No,
they can't because they're going to

1293
00:55:45,121 --> 00:55:47,040
rehydrate.
They definitely could do it two days in

1294
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:50,550
a row.
Who's got the lower BMI by one?

1295
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,290
I think.
I think he's.

1296
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:57,480
I think there was a blind way in today
and it wouldn't be fair if you base it

1297
00:55:57,481 --> 00:56:00,360
on what burt already knows because Bert
already has a goal.

1298
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:03,120
Now.
See today was all about willpower and

1299
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:07,200
Tom one that it was all about willpower.
Who's losing the most weight?

1300
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:12,201
Who Comes in the light?
Alright.

1301
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:13,060
Alright.
Alright.

1302
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,270
He has spoken,
but you're going to have to pay for the

1303
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,530
trip.
You understand that right?

1304
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,310
You have to bring a tape measure.

1305
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:21,471
Wait,
wait,

1306
00:56:21,471 --> 00:56:22,640
wait.
Tape measures.

1307
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,573
He's actually.

1308
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,010
No,
no,

1309
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,853
no,
no.

1310
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,750
Wait a minute.
He already got your dad shrunk.

1311
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,050
Old people shrink here already conceded
that old.

1312
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:38,920
They're not old to the point where
they're shrinking.

1313
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:40,383
He's like,
my dad,

1314
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,550
he was six feet.
It was really like five,

1315
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:44,690
10 because he used to be six feet was.
Yeah.

1316
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,080
People shrink
away

1317
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,083
by the way.
He can.

1318
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,170
You can.
You can stop right there.

1319
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:56,890
The goal weight was the goal weight was
to 27 or so.

1320
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:59,560
You will last well into just overweight.

1321
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,010
Yeah.
That was the goal.

1322
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,250
We
get the tape measure measure.

1323
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,230
Okay.
Listen,

1324
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,820
to make you happy because you're the one
who was going to have to pay.

1325
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,850
We will.
We will measure height and then we'll

1326
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:14,870
measure weight.
Okay.

1327
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:21,260
Okay.
All right.

1328
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:22,670
We gotta go.
Love you.

1329
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:23,504
Faggot.

1330
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,610
Wow.
Cheap piece of shit.

1331
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:33,710
Piece of shit.
He makes a bet and then horrible.

1332
00:57:33,781 --> 00:57:36,210
First of all,
he's got his money and nothing.

1333
00:57:36,211 --> 00:57:39,660
We have children.
He doesn't spend money on shit.

1334
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:42,430
I told art and always making fucking
bank.

1335
00:57:42,431 --> 00:57:46,080
He's selling out everywhere.
He's got his shows on its third season.

1336
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,990
He's killing it everywhere and I go get
a nice car.

1337
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,080
Get yourself like a little bmw and
infinity or something.

1338
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:54,220
Listen to his podcast with me and run is
easy.

1339
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:58,560
Why can understand the concept of a
fucking mortgage lending that before the

1340
00:57:58,561 --> 00:58:01,830
podcast even started that he was getting
angry that you have a mortgage,

1341
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:05,400
like why would you do that?
Because the whole premise was we

1342
00:58:05,401 --> 00:58:07,830
borrowed money against our house to do a
renovation,

1343
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,170
which is make make sense.
You know,

1344
00:58:10,171 --> 00:58:11,100
you,
your health is worse.

1345
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,680
House,
his house is worth more than you start.

1346
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,900
You paid for it,
so you borrow against that.

1347
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,940
Take out $200,000 and you renovate it
and then you make your house worth more,

1348
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,090
but your mortgage is still very small
considering that you've only borrowed a

1349
00:58:24,091 --> 00:58:25,590
minimal amount of money.
Right?

1350
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,880
Or he couldn't wrap his head around
that.

1351
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,630
No,
that's not your money.

1352
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:31,240
Money.
He yells,

1353
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,600
he gets mad and yell.
Here's the other guy do.

1354
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:33,830
He's

1355
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:36,950
going to end up trying to.
Like if he does have to pay for this,

1356
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,230
pay for it,
for like in the cheapest way possible.

1357
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:44,030
It will be like last stand is like,
he's known me forever and I've never

1358
00:58:44,031 --> 00:58:45,830
worried about money like I've always
just said,

1359
00:58:45,831 --> 00:58:47,750
just spend it and live.
You don't.

1360
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,790
You're not here forever.
You just have a good time.

1361
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:52,130
Don't go crazy.
Don't buy a bunch of Shit you can't

1362
00:58:52,131 --> 00:58:54,020
afford,
but definitely don't think about it.

1363
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:57,650
The best thing about money,
the number one thing about money,

1364
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,290
that's the best thing about it is when
you make money,

1365
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,140
you don't have to think about it.
Meaning that your bills are paid.

1366
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:09,010
I remember when I got my first
development deal when I was 25,

1367
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:11,630
20,
somewhere around then and all of a

1368
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:15,440
sudden I felt light.
I felt like I got a check and it was

1369
00:59:15,441 --> 00:59:17,360
like 100 grand or something like that,
and I was like,

1370
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,580
oh,
I don't have to feel.

1371
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:23,120
I'm not thinking about money.
It was the craziest feeling.

1372
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,560
It was like I felt lighter.
I felt like like a weight literally had

1373
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:31,010
been lifted off my shoulders.
Like it actually physically felt like

1374
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:33,890
the stress of how am I owe the fucking.
Oh.

1375
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:35,930
Then there's the phone bill,
the gas bill.

1376
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,800
Oh,
there's the rent.

1377
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:37,970
Oh,
there's the car.

1378
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,450
All that shit was gone.
Yeah.

1379
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:43,340
It's an amazing.
That's a number one good thing about

1380
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:45,890
money.
It's not about like castles and

1381
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:49,280
Ferrari's and all that bullshit and it's
about not worrying about it.

1382
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,490
That's the number one thing is you make
great money.

1383
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:54,230
You don't have to worry about a fucking
mortgage.

1384
00:59:54,231 --> 00:59:57,260
You'd find stupid.
He's crazy.

1385
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:57,930
He's out.
He doesn't.

1386
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,570
He just couldn't wrap his head around it
and we tried to make it very simple.

1387
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:04,020
Pretend you have a backpack.
Now I want to say I'd like to borrow

1388
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:06,150
against that backpack and put stuff in
your backpack.

1389
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,530
Your backpack is more valuable.
He's like,

1390
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,710
I don't understand backpacks.
Like he,

1391
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,010
he doesn't even have a watch.

1392
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,640
Yeah,
just to look at his phone or ask

1393
01:00:13,641 --> 01:00:15,290
somebody if he wants to know what time
it is.

1394
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:19,880
And his phone was made in the twenties.
Stupid fucking flip phone.

1395
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,950
He barely knows what time it is.
It's.

1396
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,710
Yeah.
It's like he's eating shoes while he's

1397
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:31,100
talking to you.
Like he's got a mouthful of like an

1398
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:35,920
undigestible thing.
Makes a living talking more or he's a

1399
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,230
professional orator.
Yeah.

1400
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,740
Ridiculous.
He tried to get out of this.

1401
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:44,270
I want to breather.
When you merged with their heart,

1402
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:47,720
their lawyer,
their lawyer.

1403
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,410
I've mentioned about God,
he said he was six one.

1404
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:54,970
How about the fact that we both lost a
considerable amount of weight?

1405
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,010
He doesn't care.
He's thinking about his money going

1406
01:00:57,011 --> 01:00:58,680
away.
Watch what?

1407
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:05,320
He's so crazy.
Wait a fucking stereotyping apart right

1408
01:01:05,381 --> 01:01:05,960
now.
He's.

1409
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,140
He's,
he's making a suit and some shoes.

1410
01:01:08,141 --> 01:01:12,490
Does it Taylor?
It's such a silly boy.

1411
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,890
Such a silly.
Should make them wear horns to this

1412
01:01:14,891 --> 01:01:17,740
game.
I just feel like.

1413
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:20,890
I mean,
how much would it cost to fly you to

1414
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:21,940
Paris and.
Well,

1415
01:01:21,941 --> 01:01:23,260
that's actually pretty expensive,
right?

1416
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:24,700
Yeah.
We're not going coach.

1417
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,460
Yeah.
How are you going to that?

1418
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,730
It's like 25 grand.
We're overweight and we can't fly.

1419
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,220
Coach.
Yeah,

1420
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:33,163
you're overweight.

1421
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:35,490
Twenty five.
I'm obese.

1422
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,680
That's what.
That's why they,

1423
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,670
they the skills wrong.
If you look up,

1424
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:39,880
look up,
scale up.

1425
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:41,970
Hilarious.
Smart Bmi.

1426
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,530
Hm.
Have you seen that?

1427
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,510
That's the one that they developed a
little bit later.

1428
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:49,140
That's supposed to be a little more
like,

1429
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:52,740
you know,
progressive in terms of knowing that

1430
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:58,250
hitting 200 and more is more along the
norm for a lot of grown.

1431
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,210
Like,
I don't know if you would read,

1432
01:02:00,211 --> 01:02:02,460
you won't register the same way you did
on that BMI.

1433
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:03,720
It was just.
It was.

1434
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:04,950
It was developed later,

1435
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:07,300
so they must be the real way to do it as
a check.

1436
01:02:07,301 --> 01:02:08,920
Actual body fat.
Yeah.

1437
01:02:08,921 --> 01:02:10,000
To get a real test.
Yeah.

1438
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,970
That's a real body medicine.
This thing at my crossfit place where

1439
01:02:12,971 --> 01:02:16,240
they were,
you can see they bring in like a tank of

1440
01:02:16,241 --> 01:02:18,610
water and you sit in a tank water.
That's how you really are supposed to

1441
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:19,920
do.
That's the Shit and then it tells you

1442
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:20,040
like

1443
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,640
how many calories you burn in a day or
how many shoe need to burn.

1444
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,160
They do that with a combine,
like they get people's body map.

1445
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,410
I'd love that.
Yeah.

1446
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:29,490
If anyone's listening,
Tom and I will totally go to a combine

1447
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:31,560
and do a combine.
That's the other thing we want to sell.

1448
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,190
We wanted to do a show burgers for
already verse Tom were the three of us

1449
01:02:35,191 --> 01:02:38,300
make bets against each other and just
outrageous beds because let's be fucking

1450
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:40,860
honest,
in one month we've lost a considerable

1451
01:02:40,861 --> 01:02:44,580
amount of weight.
If you had a time lapse of that,

1452
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:49,581
if you had a just a a show shooting that
it will be fun just to call out videos

1453
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:52,110
we've been doing to each other.
They've been fucking hilarious.

1454
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,960
Probably a 35 pounds.
Does that make sense?

1455
01:02:55,961 --> 01:02:56,830
Yeah.
In a month.

1456
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,240
In a month.
That's crazy.

1457
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:01,330
And you've lost probably.
What did you think you were a month ago?

1458
01:03:01,331 --> 01:03:02,410
Because you've been more steady.

1459
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:03,870
I been more steady.
Yeah.

1460
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:06,690
I mean up one day and he goes,
this isn't fun,

1461
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:07,560
man.
He's like,

1462
01:03:07,561 --> 01:03:10,830
this is because this isn't a good idea.
Like this is unhealthy.

1463
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,401
And I was like,
yeah,

1464
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:12,270
I know.
I go,

1465
01:03:12,271 --> 01:03:17,160
you started at asshole.
I want to be fucking eating 500 calories

1466
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:19,530
getting on a treadmill every day.
I'm using a fucking toenail.

1467
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,180
If you,
if you started with the start,

1468
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:22,680
wait,
it's 48 pounds for me,

1469
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:24,780
but then Jesus in the last,
uh,

1470
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,210
probably in the last month,
it's probably like 25

1471
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:31,950
to pick up that 35 pound kettle bell and
realize that you lost 10 pounds more

1472
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:33,300
than that.
Just pick that up.

1473
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,730
The smaller one.
Just feel that.

1474
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,821
Feel that.
Yeah.

1475
01:03:36,821 --> 01:03:39,240
Yeah.
And feel that that's 35 pounds.

1476
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,270
You've lost that in a fucking month,
dude.

1477
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:44,910
That's crazy.
I don't want to feel it.

1478
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,510
Yeah.
Feel that they think about like walking

1479
01:03:48,511 --> 01:03:50,460
around with that all day.
What a burden that is.

1480
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,920
Plantar Fasciitis.
Yeah.

1481
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:55,020
Oh for sure man.
Your feet are carrying the whole weight.

1482
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,720
Yeah.
So it's really,

1483
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,870
it's amazing what you guys have done
just because it's fun.

1484
01:04:00,871 --> 01:04:03,150
I mean it's kind of fun,
but it's obviously a lot of work,

1485
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:06,450
but I mean because you guys had this
like fun challenge and it became this

1486
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:07,284
big thing.

1487
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,810
It's definitely.
I mean like I feel like you definitely

1488
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:12,660
want to live more around this weight.
Right?

1489
01:04:12,661 --> 01:04:14,070
Going forward.
Oh yeah.

1490
01:04:14,071 --> 01:04:15,430
This will be great.
This would be great.

1491
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:19,100
You'd like to get lower.
Ideally I'd like to be 2:15.

1492
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:19,950
We'll be cool.
But yeah,

1493
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:22,320
you're not that funny.
Fat and you're like if you take your

1494
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:24,120
shirt off,
it's not funny and I would like to stop

1495
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:25,590
taking my shirt off.
Yeah.

1496
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:28,020
Well,
I've told you this in a store,

1497
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,480
like I don't take my shirt off at the
store,

1498
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,500
have taken it off,
but normally I don't like if I do a

1499
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:32,820
setting the alarm,
I'll take my shirt off.

1500
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:35,040
Right.
I don't think about taking my shirt off.

1501
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:35,940
It's just,
you know,

1502
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:40,170
it's one of those things not automatic
with you that it happened organically

1503
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,230
and then it was one of the things that
I,

1504
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:46,010
when I did my special,
I talked to my buddy cowhead,

1505
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:47,520
my counselor,
and he was just like,

1506
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,860
you're not going to do with your shirt
on run.

1507
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:50,700
I was like,
I haven't really thought about it.

1508
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:51,720
And he's like,
he's like,

1509
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,450
the thing I like about watching you to
stand up is it doesn't seem like it's

1510
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,291
different.
He's like,

1511
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:58,290
your first special,
you were dressed up and I get really

1512
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:00,240
fucked up in my head about what to wear
on stage.

1513
01:05:00,241 --> 01:05:02,010
That really kind of gets in my head
about like,

1514
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,040
I don't want to put on a costume.
Yeah.

1515
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:04,921
Right.
So for me,

1516
01:05:04,921 --> 01:05:08,220
taking my shirt off was just being.
It was authentic.

1517
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,670
It was what you were doing because you
were doing that for the last couple of

1518
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:12,660
years.
I've been doing it for like five,

1519
01:05:12,661 --> 01:05:13,500
seven years.
Is that.

1520
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:14,450
How long have you been doing that?
Yeah,

1521
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,540
the shirt off.
It started.

1522
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:18,010
Yeah,
seven years.

1523
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,420
I've been formed with a shirt on on the
road and I don't you,

1524
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,650
you can't find a picture of me a lot of
times.

1525
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:25,840
First show,
after the show I'll put my shirt on to

1526
01:05:25,841 --> 01:05:28,600
take pictures with people,
but I have so many pictures of me and my

1527
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:30,340
shirt off just because it was a,
it felt real.

1528
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:30,970
It felt.
Remember,

1529
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:33,430
let me ask you this because uh,
when I'm sick,

1530
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:35,740
if I go on stage,
I don't feel right.

1531
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:40,540
I feel off like I feel weak when you
guys are doing this,

1532
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:42,100
you're,
you're draining your body.

1533
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:44,420
So it's almost like you're sick.
It's like,

1534
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:47,730
what are your sets been like?
I'll,

1535
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:48,790
I,
I'll tell you,

1536
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:52,780
the Tampa was the day I started to
really started when I went to Tampa.

1537
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,370
By the way,
I've been on the road this whole fucking

1538
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:55,420
month doing this weight loss.

1539
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:59,650
I've done every fucking week on the road
and in Tampa.

1540
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:01,570
I was not good.
I was dizzy,

1541
01:06:01,571 --> 01:06:06,440
I couldn't get my hands warm
Florida,

1542
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,890
you can't get your hands warm.
That was crazy.

1543
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,670
I was dizzy and I was like,
I don't even think I was drinking a

1544
01:06:12,671 --> 01:06:14,290
little bit,
but I wasn't drinking much and I,

1545
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:15,700
but I wasn't eating.
That was the other thing.

1546
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:18,580
I wasn't eating any calories and I th,
I think,

1547
01:06:18,581 --> 01:06:20,380
and I'm sure if we got a doctor to tell
me this,

1548
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:25,570
I think I was probably prediabetic and
then when I stopped taking in all sugar

1549
01:06:25,571 --> 01:06:28,060
all together,
my body just went fucking crazy.

1550
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:32,590
There was a set where I was like,
I was dizzy and I,

1551
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,700
they were sending up juice to the stage
so I could get sugar in my body low like

1552
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,230
you ask them to do that.
But yeah,

1553
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:41,680
they sent up a cranberry juice and then
I drove in one day and I was like

1554
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:44,140
shivering and I pulled into mcdonalds,
got an orange juice,

1555
01:06:44,141 --> 01:06:46,120
and I was like,
something's fucking wrong.

1556
01:06:46,121 --> 01:06:48,670
My parents were worried,
but then right after that I started

1557
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,830
feeling good and then I got to like Fort
Lauderdale and I was like,

1558
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,120
Bam,
I'm on a roll.

1559
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:54,280
I was in Omaha.
Omaha is the best.

1560
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:56,290
I started losing weight.
I started feeling good,

1561
01:06:56,470 --> 01:07:00,370
and then they were doing a topless shots
upstairs.

1562
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:02,820
$3 shot topless shots once a tablet
shot,

1563
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:07,360
everyone was fucking naked to the people
that we're serving shots.

1564
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:10,420
Are you everyone in the audience?
The whole audience?

1565
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,070
What the fuck?
Yeah.

1566
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:13,203
Yeah.

1567
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:16,900
So it was just everyone upstairs,
topless.

1568
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,760
And if you were top of got a $3 shot,
tits death threat,

1569
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:23,210
it was fucking amazing.
It was the smartest thing was an Indie

1570
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,690
mortise comedy joined is the smartest
thing they ever did.

1571
01:07:25,691 --> 01:07:26,970
Everyone walked away with that,
like,

1572
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,990
you know what I mean?
Like I don't know that they care.

1573
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,090
Yeah.
It seems like they don't care in this

1574
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:32,030
picture.
Yeah.

1575
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,880
Yeah.
I send it to Tom.

1576
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:36,220
Oh yeah.
The best picture I sent to Tom here.

1577
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:37,054
Wait,
let me show it.

1578
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:39,121
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1579
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:39,521
yeah,
yeah.

1580
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:41,440
As long as you're in Indianapolis,
he could pull that shit off.

1581
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:42,550
Yeah.
You can't get away with that.

1582
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,860
Do that in New York to put you in jail
for sure.

1583
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,490
You have to have a license to date.
Day Two of cutting sugar.

1584
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:51,670
We did a live podcast and that was in a
bad fucking mood,

1585
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:52,710
man.
Yeah.

1586
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:56,020
Shut up.
And I said something to the manager and

1587
01:07:56,021 --> 01:07:57,340
then I heard Christina.
She was like,

1588
01:07:57,341 --> 01:08:00,810
just stay out of his way because I was
like snap.

1589
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,440
I didn't meet.
I apologized later,

1590
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:04,730
but it was,
I was real irritated.

1591
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:07,870
So I texted this picture to Tom and I
was like,

1592
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,570
weight loss is doing good.
Tell me what you think.

1593
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,870
Hog
Photoshop.

1594
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,900
Photoshop.
Yeah.

1595
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,130
Fucking ridiculous.
It was like,

1596
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:26,630
it was kind of on the line,
right?

1597
01:08:26,631 --> 01:08:28,040
So I was like,
Jesus man.

1598
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:29,000
He was like.
And then he wrote like,

1599
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,950
oops,
I didn't mean to send it to your waist

1600
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:33,380
down.
Modified tweeters,

1601
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:34,570
those.
And then he called daughters.

1602
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,370
Actually
Marino.

1603
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:44,270
You did go,
I was showed it to Paul Young Rom on

1604
01:08:44,271 --> 01:08:47,030
their last day and Dan Marino sat down
and I still had it on my phone.

1605
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:47,301
I go,
Dan,

1606
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:49,430
you've been in a lot of locker rooms.
What do you think about this?

1607
01:08:49,431 --> 01:08:51,650
And he goes,
hey,

1608
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,810
you were with Captain Leanne from below
deck on that.

1609
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,000
Who's that?
Oh yeah,

1610
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,780
yeah.
Some reality show.

1611
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:59,420
But what,
what reality shows below deck below deck

1612
01:08:59,421 --> 01:09:01,750
is like a,
it's chart yard,

1613
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:04,880
which I can't say yacht charters and
they have.

1614
01:09:04,881 --> 01:09:08,270
So you have like it follows the crew and
then the guests.

1615
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,450
Right?
So below deck is the crew and the guests

1616
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:14,270
are upstairs.
So it's just like a nonsense reality

1617
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:17,650
show,
but they are running out of fucking top.

1618
01:09:17,651 --> 01:09:20,220
It's super entertaining.
I get lost and yeah,

1619
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:20,810
yeah,
yeah,

1620
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:22,290
yeah.
I mean like as a fluff show,

1621
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,370
like it's something to watch as you like
it.

1622
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:25,820
A lot of stupid shows though,
right?

1623
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:31,160
A lot of stupid shit.
You ever fucking ever see his promotions

1624
01:09:31,161 --> 01:09:33,230
for his tour?
It's just some black lady putting on

1625
01:09:33,231 --> 01:09:34,064
cream.

1626
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,270
Do you ever have some of the people that
are.

1627
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:43,400
Actually,
the people from that video contact you

1628
01:09:43,401 --> 01:09:45,590
after you put their videos up.
Promos.

1629
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,170
Not as.
I don't think I'm the promos yet.

1630
01:09:48,171 --> 01:09:50,750
I've had it from um,
from your mom's house.

1631
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:53,360
Like videos,
like throat Zilla.

1632
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:54,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

1633
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,440
She reached out.
Um,

1634
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,530
she follows me.
She came to a show.

1635
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,350
She follows me.
Yeah,

1636
01:09:59,351 --> 01:10:00,860
that one I had to be really weird.
Right.

1637
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:03,950
I wasn't expect she was like posting,
you know,

1638
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:06,980
I'm going to come to this show or that
show.

1639
01:10:06,981 --> 01:10:07,910
And I was just like,
you know,

1640
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,400
I didn't respond.
I didn't know like if it was serious or

1641
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:12,820
not anyways.
And then she just showed up and goes

1642
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:14,510
like,
I don't want my picture taken.

1643
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,150
And then she was wearing a shirt that
said throat,

1644
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,710
throat,
Zilla Google me.

1645
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:21,641
So I was like,
oh,

1646
01:10:21,641 --> 01:10:23,960
okay.
But she was super nice.

1647
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:28,250
Very nice.
So you got over like what you really

1648
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:30,250
think that you were prediabetic.
Might've been you.

1649
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:31,400
Did you,
um,

1650
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,780
you want to throw in the towel for
tomorrow?

1651
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:35,360
We want to go for it.
I'm going for it.

1652
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,790
Okay.
Is already paying no matter what the

1653
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:41,270
burdens off you guys.
It's just a beard thing now.

1654
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,040
It's not beard thing.
He's very upset.

1655
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,150
Very upset.
I heard that.

1656
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,900
He's trying to roll it back.
Doesn't believe your heights?

1657
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,730
Yeah.
Lauren.

1658
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,940
Lauren.
Find out how tall they would have to be

1659
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:55,700
to be obese.
Go to have done this so much.

1660
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:59,360
I can tell you which.
If I was six foot,

1661
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:00,530
I'm still overweight.
Yeah.

1662
01:11:00,531 --> 01:11:03,320
It was like 5:11.
That would have been six foot.

1663
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:04,750
It was real close.
Will suffer.

1664
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:06,020
Sure.
He's lost.

1665
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,083
Yeah,
yeah,

1666
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,660
yeah.
He's definitely a bought Tom and I've

1667
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,390
already talked to this ad nauseum and I
trust me,

1668
01:11:11,391 --> 01:11:15,610
I've looked at that BMI scale a lot
going on.

1669
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:21,360
You're going to measure.
We just had a physical three or four

1670
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,170
months ago where they measured your
height and everything.

1671
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:24,630
Yeah.
He doesn't believe the scales.

1672
01:11:24,631 --> 01:11:27,570
Right?
I am going to my cardiologist next week.

1673
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:30,300
Next week I rescheduled it.
I was like,

1674
01:11:30,301 --> 01:11:32,700
I'm in the middle of this weight loss
challenge and it's not super healthy and

1675
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:34,320
I kind of don't want to see you now.
I was like,

1676
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:35,790
can I see it?
Yeah.

1677
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:38,550
I think you losing all this weight the
way you're doing it,

1678
01:11:38,551 --> 01:11:40,680
I don't think it's really going to fuck
with your heart that much.

1679
01:11:40,681 --> 01:11:43,750
I don't think it's a bad thing is.
I don't know

1680
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:48,780
right now dehydrated.
They will probably have some sort of

1681
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,441
effect.
Yeah,

1682
01:11:49,441 --> 01:11:49,900
yeah,
yeah.

1683
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,180
Oh,
I was supposed to go in last week and I

1684
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,070
was just like,
I don't wanna I don't want to go in.

1685
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:54,150
And him being like,
hey listen,

1686
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:57,150
you know you're [inaudible] I gotta got
something going on with my thyroid that

1687
01:11:57,151 --> 01:11:59,160
they've never really figured out,
so I don't want it to be like,

1688
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,300
you're fucking with your thyroid.

1689
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,260
I was like,
let's just get through this.

1690
01:12:01,261 --> 01:12:03,300
This is fun by the way.
That's the other part of this is that

1691
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:05,220
none of this was like,
it's all healthy.

1692
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:06,360
I want to be healthy.
I want to be.

1693
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,520
I want to live long.
I want to see my kids get married.

1694
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,960
Fucking already posted a tweet about
that would've burned gains weight.

1695
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:16,650
Then you'll be in heaven and some other
man will be holding his daughter's hand

1696
01:12:16,651 --> 01:12:18,390
walking her down the aisle fucking
already.

1697
01:12:18,391 --> 01:12:20,400
Sometimes ruthless,
ruthless,

1698
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,350
ruthless.
It's almost like he's like a.

1699
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:25,680
he's got asperger's or something like
the way he just like when he went,

1700
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:27,720
when I walked in his room that day,
the day the challenge started,

1701
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:28,890
he's just like,
I was like,

1702
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:29,724
what's up?
And he's like,

1703
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:31,920
you're fat,
you're fat,

1704
01:12:31,921 --> 01:12:33,030
you're obese.
Oh my God,

1705
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:34,500
you're obese.
It's disgusting.

1706
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,610
You're,
you're obese.

1707
01:12:35,611 --> 01:12:36,331
And then I'm like,
okay,

1708
01:12:36,331 --> 01:12:37,060
it's good seeing you already.

1709
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:39,670
How you doing?
He said,

1710
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,480
I was going to talk to you about family,
but you're just obese and you're like,

1711
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:45,540
I'm here for like an hour.
I gotta run back to OPI radio.

1712
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:46,840
Do you want to.
Can we do a podcast?

1713
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:48,720
Wow.
You're just so fat.

1714
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,240
How fast do you think Tom is?
Oh yeah.

1715
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:54,420
That's how it started is already just
fucking see.

1716
01:12:54,421 --> 01:12:57,090
He probably wouldn't be so intense about
it if he wouldn't.

1717
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:01,230
He didn't have the possibility of him
paying money right over his head.

1718
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:04,290
I bet you he's obsessing right now.
He's mad right now.

1719
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:05,790
He's mad.
Fuck.

1720
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,730
He's like your skills broken broken
skills.

1721
01:13:08,731 --> 01:13:09,530
No.
Good.

1722
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:10,500
Yeah.
He takes,

1723
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:15,590
he thinks things are heavier than they
are or you think that skills bullshit.

1724
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:20,580
They're lighter or heavier.
Something's wrong.

1725
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:23,490
Fucking Rad.
He's just thinking about a way to get

1726
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:24,020
out of it.
Right?

1727
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,220
Absolutely.
Scrambling.

1728
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:28,080
I mean we put a 35 pound weight on that
scale.

1729
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:29,940
It was 35,
but not only that though,

1730
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:32,910
he brought up the height thing to me,
I don't know,

1731
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:36,030
a month or so ago,
and I had a long.

1732
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:36,960
I was like,
look man,

1733
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:39,630
we need to know what the goal weight
just is.

1734
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,360
And he tweets.
He agreed it was 2:27,

1735
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:43,620
27.
It was what?

1736
01:13:43,621 --> 01:13:44,640
It was a very,
very beginning.

1737
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,340
Both way under that.
When I got here today,

1738
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:49,410
I thought it would be 2:26 and
something.

1739
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,540
You're almost 10 pounds under that.
Yeah,

1740
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:52,381
yeah,
yeah.

1741
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:53,430
You are.
Yeah,

1742
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,540
yeah.
Yeah.

1743
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,600
So he lost.
Let's just talk about the beard now.

1744
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:59,760
Are we shaping the whole thing off?
She gets.

1745
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:04,470
You should make you aware it Hitler a
new state on the trip with already.

1746
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,200
He's got to film a comedy Central Show,
right?

1747
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:12,340
What is it on the eighth?
I gotta film Goddamn Jam on the

1748
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,270
Eleventh,
January 11th,

1749
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,880
and Ryan sickler has been fucking texted
me.

1750
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,990
He's like,
you got this man,

1751
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:19,630
don't let,
don't come on this show without a beard.

1752
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,100
Oh yeah,
you're fucked.

1753
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,480
You want to hear something crazy?
Yeah.

1754
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:23,343
So,
uh,

1755
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,590
so
this song,

1756
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:30,520
Bert Kreischer and everyone's like,
which one

1757
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,200
you've had beards and not beards since
I've known you.

1758
01:14:35,201 --> 01:14:36,770
Like when I first met you,
you didn't have a beard.

1759
01:14:36,771 --> 01:14:38,070
I just had stubble.
Yeah,

1760
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,090
yeah.
When did you go full beard?

1761
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:43,750
Probably when I got fatter.
But doesn't that make your face look

1762
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:44,980
even bigger?
It does actually.

1763
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:47,140
It does weight.
If it gets real bushy,

1764
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:48,910
you definitely.
Even if you're fat,

1765
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:49,810
it does.
It looks better.

1766
01:14:49,811 --> 01:14:51,430
And then you trim it and you're like,
oh,

1767
01:14:51,431 --> 01:14:54,940
it looks like I lost 20 pounds.
I went full beard when this Guy Evan

1768
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:56,090
Tanner died,
get that guy who.

1769
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:59,200
That's the saddest part of this whole
thing is tom used to be hot.

1770
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,600
He used to look at push.

1771
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,390
She looks great.
That's a different gal.

1772
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:09,630
Was take the police shit.
She got paid to take a picture of

1773
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,230
Christ.
You're closing in on that though,

1774
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,060
Dude.
That's probably will never see that

1775
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:15,070
again.
Bullshit never goes away.

1776
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:17,710
It is.
Maybe 25.

1777
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:20,220
How big.
How big do you think you were there in

1778
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,000
[inaudible]?
Ninety five.

1779
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:21,701
You know what?
Honestly,

1780
01:15:21,701 --> 01:15:23,240
your shoulders are bigger now.
Like,

1781
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:24,360
Oh,
you've been lifting weight.

1782
01:15:24,361 --> 01:15:26,770
You actually stronger.
Bigger.

1783
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:28,710
Um,
yes.

1784
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,070
Young,
young man right there.

1785
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:31,570
Wow.
How old are you there?

1786
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:34,330
Twenty one or 22.
Wow.

1787
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:36,370
That's actually how I,
that's me.

1788
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,240
The same year I came to La,
so I came here with like their dreams

1789
01:15:40,241 --> 01:15:41,080
and your eyes.
Oh my God.

1790
01:15:41,081 --> 01:15:43,090
So many dreams.
Can you imagine if it said,

1791
01:15:43,091 --> 01:15:44,010
hey,
get fat.

1792
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:47,320
You'll get famous.
Get Fat as fuck me,

1793
01:15:47,321 --> 01:15:51,460
Mike Tyson and you'll give.
You didn't have to be fat to be famous.

1794
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:54,130
You know?
I remember Kevin James had this manager.

1795
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:55,600
It's terrible manager.
At one point in time,

1796
01:15:55,601 --> 01:15:58,930
Kevin was trying to lose weight and his
manager was just a fucking idiot.

1797
01:15:58,931 --> 01:15:59,764
He said,
Kevin,

1798
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,210
don't do it.
When you're losing weight,

1799
01:16:01,211 --> 01:16:02,860
you're losing roles.
Yeah.

1800
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:06,370
It was like telling him roles in movies
and shit and they will tell me that

1801
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:07,840
don't lose weight.
You won't be funding anymore.

1802
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:10,750
So one of the dumbest things that you
can say,

1803
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:13,870
well that's the people have this idea
that you can't be fit and be funny.

1804
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,900
It's so stupid.
Yeah.

1805
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,070
And then I heard someone say,
name a name,

1806
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:20,230
fat comments aren't funny.
I was like,

1807
01:16:20,231 --> 01:16:20,741
what?
Oh,

1808
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:21,860
that's ridiculous.
Venison.

1809
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,590
Yeah.
Funniest of all time.

1810
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,900
Is that as fuck?
Find a picture when Jamie.

1811
01:16:25,901 --> 01:16:28,330
See if you can go on my instagram and
see the picture of when I was skinny.

1812
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:29,050
This is gonna.

1813
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:30,390
You've ever seen this?
Like half?

1814
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:31,303
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1815
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:35,070
Fucking different.
Real different either.

1816
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,520
I haven't had.
I've had a beard.

1817
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,620
My daughter's have never seen me without
a beard.

1818
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,640
Well,
by the way,

1819
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:42,670
if I lose,
my son is going to be terrified.

1820
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:44,230
You know,
if I come home to.

1821
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:47,230
That happened to me when my daughter was
really little.

1822
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,180
I had a full crazy beard because this
guy,

1823
01:16:49,181 --> 01:16:51,190
Evan Tanner was a former UFC
middleweight champion.

1824
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:52,750
He died.
He had this big beard,

1825
01:16:52,751 --> 01:16:56,650
so a bunch of us online,
bunch of fans decided to grow a beard

1826
01:16:56,651 --> 01:16:59,590
for Evan and I grew a fucking werewolf
beard,

1827
01:16:59,591 --> 01:17:02,110
like a full on know if you've ever seen
me

1828
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:06,160
out into the forest,
but look at Youtube.

1829
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,890
Beautiful guys are great there.
Yeah.

1830
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,063
What year is this?

1831
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,270
You had a goatee,
burke.

1832
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,430
You have six,
right?

1833
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:14,500
It's got to be.
Oh,

1834
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,220
four.
Oh four.

1835
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:19,310
That was for you.
We performed with the porn stars that

1836
01:17:19,311 --> 01:17:20,880
night.
What'd you guys at?

1837
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:22,910
That's not me.
You and Nick Thune perform with the porn

1838
01:17:22,911 --> 01:17:26,810
stars that I'm certain of it.
See if you can find one with me with my

1839
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:28,250
beard.
I miss it sometimes.

1840
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,860
It was glorious.
It was big,

1841
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:33,260
thick.
Fucking bushy,

1842
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:36,170
crazy beard.
My daughters will lose their shit.

1843
01:17:36,171 --> 01:17:40,040
So what happened was I shaved my beard
off and my daughter didn't see me

1844
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:44,240
shaving the beard off and she started
crying looking at me.

1845
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,160
Yeah.
I had a full on beard son.

1846
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,440
That was when I was living in Colorado.
I trimmed this,

1847
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,810
trimmed it down because if I don't trim
it down,

1848
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:54,350
it goes all the way up to two or,
you know,

1849
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,490
just to look,
just look,

1850
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:57,350
it just looks like I'm.
Because of the beard.

1851
01:17:57,351 --> 01:17:57,681
Yeah.
See,

1852
01:17:57,681 --> 01:17:58,460
right there.
You could see it.

1853
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,410
God Dang.
Yeah.

1854
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,490
They thinking about bread,
bread,

1855
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,650
bread.
Yeah.

1856
01:18:06,651 --> 01:18:08,870
Um,
it's um,

1857
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:10,880
it's a manly thing,
right?

1858
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:12,410
Having a beard is a fucking manly.
Yeah.

1859
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:14,440
Then you get like,
you just get used to it and then,

1860
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:17,240
you know,
I would put lotion in it to smooth it

1861
01:18:17,241 --> 01:18:18,210
out.
Do that.

1862
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,930
Uh,
no.

1863
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,020
I have a rash inside my beard.
So if I lose my beard,

1864
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:27,990
uh,
we're going to get to see what a

1865
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,350
Vietnamese children's hands

1866
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:31,550
look like.
Look at that picture.

1867
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:33,280
That's a ridiculous picture.
Look at you.

1868
01:18:33,281 --> 01:18:36,500
You look like you're a little cute
little blue eyed baby.

1869
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:38,810
When we were walking through the forest
in Vietnam,

1870
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:43,100
we walked on this village and these kids
had never seen a dude with a beard

1871
01:18:43,101 --> 01:18:46,400
before because in Vietnam it'll grow
beards and they'd never been out of the

1872
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:48,740
jungle.
And so we walked in and I came in with a

1873
01:18:48,741 --> 01:18:51,380
beard and they fucking lost their shit.
Thought I was a werewolf.

1874
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,450
A million fucking around.
Yeah.

1875
01:18:53,451 --> 01:18:55,040
They lost her shit and they ran in
hothead.

1876
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:58,250
I've never had that reaction with kids.
I'm always really good with kids.

1877
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,360
And so I was like,
what's wrong?

1878
01:18:59,361 --> 01:19:01,790
And Tt was our,
our fixer.

1879
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:03,680
And he's like,
your beard scares them.

1880
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:05,600
They think you're a wolf.
And I said,

1881
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,580
Oh,
let me tell them I'm okay.

1882
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:10,310
So we brought a guitar over and we sat
with these kids and they wouldn't stop

1883
01:19:10,311 --> 01:19:13,310
looking at my beard.
So I go into my bag and I had had

1884
01:19:13,311 --> 01:19:14,600
skittles and m and m's with me.

1885
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,870
So I pulled out skittles,
they'd never had fucking skittles and

1886
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:19,340
give him skittles.
Nate's light up.

1887
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,820
And then one of the kids is like,
it says in Vietnamese can play in your

1888
01:19:22,821 --> 01:19:23,980
face.
So I said,

1889
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:26,000
sure.
So then all the kids started playing in

1890
01:19:26,001 --> 01:19:29,030
my face.
One kid had this funky hand and I was

1891
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:29,990
like,
I was like,

1892
01:19:29,991 --> 01:19:32,480
this isn't going to go good.
And he gets in my head on,

1893
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,210
as soon as he does it,
I feel everything get hot on my side.

1894
01:19:35,211 --> 01:19:36,320
I'm like,
oh,

1895
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:39,230
I couldn't say anything.
And then it was on his hand,

1896
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,120
I don't know,
just fucking disgusting.

1897
01:19:41,121 --> 01:19:44,270
Like he had never washed his hand.
And uh,

1898
01:19:44,271 --> 01:19:46,670
and so I've,
I've had this like thing that I've been

1899
01:19:46,671 --> 01:19:49,460
putting cortisone on for the last month,
trying to get it to go away.

1900
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,600
And Katelyn,
I lose my beard.

1901
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:52,340
Dermatologist.
No,

1902
01:19:52,341 --> 01:19:54,290
because I'm a beard.
No one saw it so I didn't give a fuck.

1903
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:57,860
I hope so.
It's thing for a month.

1904
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,930
How long?
Year and a half.

1905
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:02,150
Jesus Christ Burns.
Go to a doctor.

1906
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,650
I had a beard.
It's like if you get a pimple and a

1907
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:05,061
beard,
you're like,

1908
01:20:05,061 --> 01:20:05,590
yeah,
fuck it.

1909
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:08,040
You forget about it.
That's some crazy shit growing on

1910
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,910
your face,
please,

1911
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:14,040
please,
please,

1912
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:16,520
please let it be.
Please let it.

1913
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:18,480
My wife's been saying to me,
she's like,

1914
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:20,940
you need to shave your beard and let it
air out because it's just that,

1915
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:22,410
you know,
you sleep on your cheek.

1916
01:20:22,411 --> 01:20:24,060
And so it gets warm every night.
And it's like,

1917
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,760
so yeah man,
whatever the fuck it is,

1918
01:20:26,761 --> 01:20:29,820
it's supposed to go away by now.
You should go to a doctor.

1919
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:32,520
I'm not the doctor type.
But what time are we weighing in

1920
01:20:32,521 --> 01:20:33,570
tomorrow?
That's why I think we didn't know.

1921
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:36,890
What time would you want to do tomorrow?
What time works for them?

1922
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:40,650
Me.
Same time I'm getting,

1923
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,200
but we're getting fucked up tomorrow
too.

1924
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:43,413
Okay.
Okay.

1925
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:44,880
So what,
what kind of boots do you.

1926
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:47,220
Mom will bring to Tito's and soda and
will bring pizza.

1927
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:48,220
Cheetos.
Oh,

1928
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,320
okay.
Okay.

1929
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,510
Okay.
Tito's and soda to.

1930
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:56,100
What's the Tito Tito's vodka?

1931
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,350
Vodka.
I don't know.

1932
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,500
Shit.
I think they're Austin based,

1933
01:20:58,501 --> 01:20:59,580
right?
They're Austin based.

1934
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:01,050
And uh,
the guy's name is Bert.

1935
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:03,540
The owner of the company is named for
you to get some of that and we'll

1936
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:06,370
actually eats us.
So we'll take an order at the end of the

1937
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:07,700
day.
They are a pizza you want?

1938
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:08,070
No,
no,

1939
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:09,170
they're their team.
Burt's.

1940
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:11,590
Let's do grey goose and sodas instead.
Ah,

1941
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:15,330
we'll do team.
We'll do a Tito's and Greg,

1942
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:16,810
you're a grey goose guy.
Grandiose.

1943
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:19,230
And so I am since they went and burt
went,

1944
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:21,360
team Burlington contacted you.
That hit me up.

1945
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:23,220
They're like,
love the weight loss team.

1946
01:21:23,221 --> 01:21:23,830
Burton.
Yeah.

1947
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:26,700
I had a bottle but I poured that shit
down to Jack Daniels is team Rogan.

1948
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:29,280
If you want to hop on board list that
want to go jack and coke?

1949
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,050
I'll do.
I haven't had that in forever.

1950
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,030
I'll,
I'll join it on it.

1951
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:33,720
Okay.
All right.

1952
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,130
Jack and cokes tomorrow.
We're gonna get.

1953
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,640
We're gonna get loopy.
Really fucked up tomorrow.

1954
01:21:38,641 --> 01:21:40,460
Yeah.
Okay.

1955
01:21:40,461 --> 01:21:44,310
So I've got to catch you up.
Do you want Dan super subs?

1956
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:44,751
No,
no,

1957
01:21:44,751 --> 01:21:45,001
no,
no,

1958
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:45,890
no,
no.

1959
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:47,650
I've been thinking about this for a
fucking bully.

1960
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:48,780
Okay.
Can we get.

1961
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,300
Can we get a pizza and hot wings?
Oh yeah,

1962
01:21:51,301 --> 01:21:54,480
for sure.
The only problem is getting it here at

1963
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:56,790
11:00 AM.
How many pizza places are open at 10?

1964
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:58,580
They're open.
They're open pretty early just for

1965
01:21:58,650 --> 01:21:59,920
slobs.
Pizza.

1966
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,410
Pizza for breakfast.
Okay.

1967
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,910
Can we get some thin crust,
Pepperoni,

1968
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,740
whatever the fuck you want.
We'll take an order.

1969
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:06,090
Will take an order and we'll bring it
in.

1970
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:08,490
We should also do a,
uh,

1971
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:13,540
a post binge wait,
see what we get up to.

1972
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:14,760
Yeah,
we should,

1973
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,400
we should go hard.
Go hard and figure it out.

1974
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:17,671
Alright,
I'll,

1975
01:22:17,671 --> 01:22:18,840
I'll even eat pizza tomorrow.

1976
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:20,110
So,
um,

1977
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:22,380
that's going to be hard.
The weird part about this way and shit

1978
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:25,980
is it's kind of fucked with my head a
little bit like in that I can

1979
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,570
understand.
I'm not saying I understand,

1980
01:22:27,571 --> 01:22:30,840
but I understand what like anorexics the
control part of it,

1981
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:31,870
you know,
like,

1982
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:32,520
uh,
I don't,

1983
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,800
I think I get the control part where you
go,

1984
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,740
I'm not eating anything.
And then you feel you're in control.

1985
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:39,840
You're like eating an apple and like,
oh I shouldn't have had that.

1986
01:22:39,841 --> 01:22:40,770
That's a lot of sugar.
I'm like,

1987
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,430
well maybe I should throw that up.
Like I understand that part because I

1988
01:22:44,431 --> 01:22:47,970
bet tomorrow that first piece of pizza
is going to be very hard for me to eat

1989
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:52,740
because I haven't had anything.
I've had a lot of anxiety over this.

1990
01:22:53,150 --> 01:22:57,210
Over what?
I had dreams last night that Bernie Shaw

1991
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:58,860
was running me through fucking training
camp.

1992
01:22:59,010 --> 01:22:59,910
Really?
Dude.

1993
01:22:59,911 --> 01:23:02,280
Yeah.
Like I had a hundred dreams about Bernie

1994
01:23:02,281 --> 01:23:06,010
shop last night I dreamt that I put
Justin Bieber in the beat

1995
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,870
the shit out of him.
Yeah.

1996
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:09,850
Would you beat them with.
I beat him with my hands,

1997
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:14,880
but then I slammed his head against the
floor or what caused the anger?

1998
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:20,740
He said something about he's like nice
jacket at a diner and I go,

1999
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,240
thanks.
I like your hair.

2000
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:23,290
And he's like,
what'd you say to me?

2001
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:26,800
And as soon as he said that I jumped
over the thing and I like elbowed him in

2002
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:30,040
the face and took them and start
slamming his head against the wall and

2003
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:34,660
then it just cut to,
in my dream it just cut to me walking

2004
01:23:34,661 --> 01:23:37,570
out of a jail and there was tmz there
and they're like,

2005
01:23:37,571 --> 01:23:40,370
why did you attack him when it was just
a big misunderstanding like,

2006
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:44,290
uh,
like people say after like street

2007
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:44,870
fights,
you know,

2008
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:49,870
like it was just understanding that.
And then I dropped that was a going in a

2009
01:23:50,891 --> 01:23:52,600
car and people were following me and
they're like,

2010
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:53,590
you shouldn't have attacked that guy.

2011
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:57,370
Don't know if I woke up.
That's a lyric.

2012
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,510
What's the biggest thing you've cheated
on this whole?

2013
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:01,390
What's the one splurge?
We were like,

2014
01:24:01,391 --> 01:24:04,750
fuck it.
I can tell you mine right now.

2015
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:08,110
He's had nothing but water.
No food wise.

2016
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:09,910
Food Wise.
But for drinking,

2017
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:14,350
he had,
it was coffee and water out there with

2018
01:24:14,351 --> 01:24:15,131
water.
Yeah.

2019
01:24:15,131 --> 01:24:16,450
And then I.
and then I cut coffee.

2020
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:22,230
Coffee to 19 billion cups of coffee
today.

2021
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,920
You did today.
Do that today.

2022
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,970
I had to get on the treadmill.
Yeah.

2023
01:24:27,971 --> 01:24:30,000
But you don't have to have the coffee to
get on the treadmill.

2024
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,570
Does.
I needed that.

2025
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:34,410
Now it's song number two by blurted.
Get the day started.

2026
01:24:34,411 --> 01:24:37,660
It was the cup of coffee like the big
ones.

2027
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,030
Do you know that's probably like eight
ounces.

2028
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:43,270
You probably drank a pound of coffee.
Watch out.

2029
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,600
That might've been the difference
tomorrow.

2030
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,620
Just have a fucking.
I'll just do a little bump of coke.

2031
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,830
There'll be fucking do.
Have you ever worked out on coke?

2032
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:55,990
Have you?
And you fucking kill it.

2033
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:58,240
Really?
I used to play basketball,

2034
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,770
uh,
after smoking weed,

2035
01:24:59,771 --> 01:25:02,920
like pickup games in college.
And when I first got out here,

2036
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:08,010
I took some of the best pickup games I
ever played was just like,

2037
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:09,550
well nba players are famous,
you know,

2038
01:25:09,551 --> 01:25:10,384
they,
they,

2039
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:11,910
there was in the contract or a whole
one.

2040
01:25:11,911 --> 01:25:13,530
But yeah,
the whole Mba suite.

2041
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:16,980
It's amazing.
Like if you've viewed,

2042
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:19,180
dialed in,
I mean I imagine it might be like that

2043
01:25:19,181 --> 01:25:21,060
with Jujitsu in it is 100 percent like
that,

2044
01:25:21,061 --> 01:25:23,540
which you're dialed in on in basketball.
If you're like me,

2045
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:26,050
you can lose yourself and like see plays
before,

2046
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,390
you know,
see somebody hitting the whole before it

2047
01:25:28,391 --> 01:25:29,560
happens.
You start,

2048
01:25:29,561 --> 01:25:31,630
you get in the zone and you're just
zoned in on it.

2049
01:25:31,631 --> 01:25:33,030
Man,
I probably,

2050
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:37,660
I probably spot on Jujitsu thousands of
times.

2051
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:41,500
Really thousands,
like no bullshit over the course of 20

2052
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:42,940
years.
I probably can.

2053
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:44,560
Yeah.
Many,

2054
01:25:44,561 --> 01:25:45,011
many,
many,

2055
01:25:45,011 --> 01:25:45,521
many,
many,

2056
01:25:45,521 --> 01:25:46,480
many,
many times.

2057
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:51,610
Smoked and then done Jujitsu many times
because everybody does it.

2058
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,800
It's like one of these dudes would meet
at 10th planet.

2059
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:57,420
We'd meet in the parking lot and get lit
up and then go in there and wrote it.

2060
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:59,230
How high?
Like fuck.

2061
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,330
Oh you get really low.
High.

2062
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:01,720
Forget what I'm talking about.
Really?

2063
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,010
Yeah.
Wow.

2064
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,130
Yeah.
But

2065
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,220
like you can't learn anything on high
when you're highlight that you don't

2066
01:26:07,221 --> 01:26:08,310
learn shit.
You just do,

2067
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:09,710
you,
you're super creative.

2068
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:11,010
Like,
like uh,

2069
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,830
it's not good at someone's trying to
teach you something,

2070
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:15,740
but what it is good for is if you
already know things,

2071
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:18,860
you already know things and you just get
loose and zoned out and then he could

2072
01:26:18,861 --> 01:26:20,840
just,
you feel the moves better.

2073
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:22,640
You feel like the attacks better.

2074
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:24,440
No.
I know you've probably already talked

2075
01:26:24,441 --> 01:26:26,750
about this,
but I haven't heard you talk about it

2076
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:29,030
real quick.
What about the Ronda Rousey thing?

2077
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,030
Crazy fight.
I'm not good.

2078
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:34,330
Not Good.
Oh,

2079
01:26:34,450 --> 01:26:37,200
it was.
You could see the panic.

2080
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:40,950
He could see the anxiety.
You could see the difference in the

2081
01:26:40,951 --> 01:26:45,540
skill level striking wise.
Like I just think the whole,

2082
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,600
there was a lot wrong with her camp.
A lot wrong with her preparation of lot

2083
01:26:50,731 --> 01:26:55,110
wrong with her mindset and a lot wrong
with our skillset in comparison to that

2084
01:26:55,111 --> 01:26:58,170
woman.
Amanda Nunez is a fucking monster.

2085
01:26:58,290 --> 01:27:01,260
She's a monster.
I knew that like a long time ago,

2086
01:27:01,261 --> 01:27:03,180
I was,
I thought she was the biggest threat to

2087
01:27:03,181 --> 01:27:05,280
Rhonda before Rhonda got knocked out by
Holly.

2088
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:07,290
I was like,
I think Amanda Nunez is the biggest

2089
01:27:07,291 --> 01:27:11,550
threat because every fight start
standing and holly is a very good

2090
01:27:11,551 --> 01:27:15,150
striker,
but the real danger for holly I always

2091
01:27:15,151 --> 01:27:18,450
thought was her kicks in.
That's what she knocked out with a head

2092
01:27:18,451 --> 01:27:21,190
kick.
But like it kicks her harder to lay your

2093
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:25,140
head kicks heartland that a punch when
in exchanges Rhonda would get punched,

2094
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:27,240
you know,
and I'd seen her get punched by Meesha

2095
01:27:27,241 --> 01:27:28,170
and other people had punched her.

2096
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:30,790
I'm like,
if fucking Amanda Nunez punches her,

2097
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,610
she's gonna,
she's gonna get fucked up.

2098
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,360
And that's exactly what happened.
But it was way worse because she was

2099
01:27:36,361 --> 01:27:40,680
still recovering psychologically from
that Holly Holm fight.

2100
01:27:40,681 --> 01:27:43,890
And then also physiologically when you
get head kicked,

2101
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:46,500
we were talking about on the podcast
podcast yesterday,

2102
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,980
there's some people that get head kicked
and they are never the same again.

2103
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:51,990
Like never.
You never know.

2104
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,780
Some people get a head injury and
they're okay.

2105
01:27:54,781 --> 01:27:57,210
A few months later,
some people get a head injury and

2106
01:27:57,211 --> 01:28:02,211
they're never the same.
The same person who you were goes away.

2107
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:04,530
A person,
any head injury,

2108
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:05,550
do that.
You know,

2109
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:07,260
and I know someone from minute.
It was in an accident.

2110
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:10,410
Nothing to do with fighting head trauma.
Never the same.

2111
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:10,831
Well,
you know,

2112
01:28:10,831 --> 01:28:14,550
that's the Sam kinison story.
Sam kinison was one person and then he

2113
01:28:14,551 --> 01:28:19,410
got hit by a truck I think when he was a
little kid and was never the same again.

2114
01:28:19,411 --> 01:28:21,900
And then also he was just reckless
fucking wild man.

2115
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,510
He was like,
this calm collected kid.

2116
01:28:24,511 --> 01:28:29,130
Normal kid kinda shy,
gets hit by a fucking truck and then all

2117
01:28:29,131 --> 01:28:31,290
of a sudden he's just wild man.
It doesn't give a fuck.

2118
01:28:31,291 --> 01:28:33,150
Is taking crazy chances and risks.

2119
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:33,901
Wow.
You know,

2120
01:28:33,901 --> 01:28:35,970
I had a serious head injury.
There you go.

2121
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:39,000
For crusher.
Thrown on my head in college and a fight

2122
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:44,600
and knocked unconscious and then was out
of it and wandering around the campus

2123
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,150
last didn't know who I was,
didn't know where it was.

2124
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:50,820
Nobody brought you to a doctor.
This girl did this girl did.

2125
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,950
Scott found me on campus and I was
confused.

2126
01:28:52,951 --> 01:28:54,810
I didn't know where I was.
And then she,

2127
01:28:54,811 --> 01:28:56,280
uh,
it was if I was in the middle of the day

2128
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:01,460
while I was in a fraternity,
I had written a song about a.

2129
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,450
and I did,
I had sung before and I guess he had

2130
01:29:03,451 --> 01:29:05,550
been upset before and told me that I
just didn't understand it.

2131
01:29:05,551 --> 01:29:08,700
So that's a problem with me is sometimes
I cast the big wake and I don't get that

2132
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:11,280
I'm upsetting people that everyone's
having a good time and they feel like

2133
01:29:11,281 --> 01:29:12,660
I'm making fun of them,
but I'm not,

2134
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,360
I'm just being fun,
stay the same,

2135
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:15,203
you know?

2136
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:17,700
And he came up to me in the middle of
the day and he was,

2137
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:20,670
I was Solomon,
we were really good friends and he was,

2138
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,760
he was big and he was like,
stay the fuck away from me.

2139
01:29:23,761 --> 01:29:27,030
And I thought he was kidding around and
I went up to him and he was like,

2140
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,200
I'm fucking serious.
And he's like,

2141
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:29,130
got in my face.
I was like,

2142
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:31,230
are you,
are you really going to fucking hit me?

2143
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,670
We're friends.
And He fucking grabbed me and tried to

2144
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:41,120
and then literally like Suplex me and
flip flop me on my head and I went out

2145
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:45,390
and I woke up and he was holding my
tongue so I swallowed my tongue.

2146
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:49,170
He was holding my tongue out of my mouth
and he was crying and he was like,

2147
01:29:49,171 --> 01:29:50,430
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

2148
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:51,600
And I didn't know what happened.

2149
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,370
And I just walked around.
I started walking around campus.

2150
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:58,080
This girl found me a in the middle of
like and then drove me.

2151
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:00,460
She drove me to the hospital and I was
in the hospital.

2152
01:30:00,461 --> 01:30:01,710
I was so confused.
I didn't know anything.

2153
01:30:01,711 --> 01:30:04,740
I didn't know who the president was and
I kind of started like coming,

2154
01:30:04,741 --> 01:30:05,850
figuring it out.
And then,

2155
01:30:05,851 --> 01:30:08,940
um,
and then my girlfriend and my best

2156
01:30:08,941 --> 01:30:10,980
friend came out and got me and took me
home.

2157
01:30:10,981 --> 01:30:12,540
But like,
for like a week I'd go like,

2158
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:15,660
I remember one time I went to go get the
mail with my dog and I forgot where our

2159
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:17,430
apartment was.
And I was like,

2160
01:30:17,431 --> 01:30:19,920
where the fuck is our apartment mate?
Did you see the guy again?

2161
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:23,010
And he graduated that,
he was older than me.

2162
01:30:23,011 --> 01:30:25,710
He graduated that year and he came back,
oddly enough,

2163
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:28,200
he came back and he tried to apologize
and I was just like,

2164
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:29,420
I was like,
I dunno,

2165
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:31,290
I'll never see you again.
You can go fuck yourself.

2166
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:35,880
I felt so guilty about beating up Justin
Bieber in my dream and I downloaded two

2167
01:30:35,881 --> 01:30:38,820
of his songs after I woke up.
Which ones?

2168
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:41,390
Cause he's got two really good ones.
I think it was like this,

2169
01:30:41,391 --> 01:30:43,410
sorry.
One and the uh,

2170
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,210
the other big hit from last year or
whatever it was.

2171
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:52,300
The one that Michael Chasing or not
Michael j.

2172
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,820
The uh,
the other black guy from snl.

2173
01:30:54,670 --> 01:30:55,870
A,
I don't know.

2174
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:57,960
Fucking Jay Pharaoh.
Oh,

2175
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:00,300
that's racist.
I didn't mean that you guys,

2176
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:02,700
but you.
But you're both black guys on snl.

2177
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,500
I've seen a ton of people get hit in the
head.

2178
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:08,530
I've probably seen more people get
knocked the fuck out.

2179
01:31:08,531 --> 01:31:13,531
Then I would say the.
Then one percent of all the living

2180
01:31:14,711 --> 01:31:16,540
humans that have ever lived.
Probably.

2181
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:17,463
Yeah,
probably.

2182
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,240
Yeah,
most likely.

2183
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,950
Yeah.
It scares me.

2184
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,470
Head injury scare me more than anything
because it just don't,

2185
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,420
you don't know the scariest part.
Nice.

2186
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:30,780
When I watch boxing or MMA,
even like the recap afterwards is when

2187
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:35,380
you see it obviously different in slow
mo or afterwards,

2188
01:31:35,381 --> 01:31:39,280
but when you see that,
that that knockout blow has been landed

2189
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:44,800
and fighters so zone zoned in on what
he's doing that he'll get in to more,

2190
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:45,721
you know,
and,

2191
01:31:45,721 --> 01:31:47,220
and it's,
it's already like,

2192
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,810
no,
like it's over and then you'll see like

2193
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:51,400
another hit and,
and it's,

2194
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:54,010
it's,
it's the lights were already off and you

2195
01:31:54,011 --> 01:31:58,450
see the whole head to go and then like a
second one is bouncing off the campus

2196
01:31:58,451 --> 01:31:59,770
and you're like,
my God.

2197
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:00,100
And

2198
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,220
then you know,
the ref even when,

2199
01:32:01,221 --> 01:32:03,310
if he's good jumps in and stops it,

2200
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:04,090
but you're like,
that's,

2201
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:06,120
that's way too much.
That's happened already.

2202
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:09,720
There was a bad one this past weekend.
I'm Mike pyle fought this guy,

2203
01:32:09,721 --> 01:32:11,470
Alex Garcia,
and uh,

2204
01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:14,460
he got hit with a right hand and
dropped.

2205
01:32:14,461 --> 01:32:16,890
You got knocked out.
And then as one unconscious,

2206
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:21,620
his head bounced off the canvas and the
head bounces are the scariest ones.

2207
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,780
God goes out and then as he's fallen on
his head,

2208
01:32:24,781 --> 01:32:29,781
just a bang and when he got up he was
out for a bit and then he woke up,

2209
01:32:30,151 --> 01:32:33,120
he did not know what happened and they
tried to tell him he got knocked out and

2210
01:32:33,121 --> 01:32:33,954
he's like,
no way,

2211
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:36,060
and then he goes,
no fuck.

2212
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:38,090
But then he kept saying what happened?
And he's like,

2213
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:39,240
you got knocked out.
I was like,

2214
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:40,850
no.
What happened?

2215
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:43,410
That's,
that's real comment.

2216
01:32:43,411 --> 01:32:46,020
I've seen that many times when people
get knocked out.

2217
01:32:46,021 --> 01:32:48,770
Can you believe bingos recovery?
How is she doing now?

2218
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:50,070
Doing Great.
She is.

2219
01:32:50,071 --> 01:32:52,140
She's back at the fun house.
Is She?

2220
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:53,100
Yeah.
When

2221
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:54,070
she.
They released her.

2222
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:54,900
I mean it was,
it was,

2223
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,320
it was.
It wasn't an easy path.

2224
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,240
You haven't talked to doug about it.
Totally anonymous,

2225
01:32:58,241 --> 01:33:00,850
but you got to explain the story.
Bingo for her.

2226
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:03,520
I know I'm not speaking out of school.
I think this is stuff all dog is shared,

2227
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,850
but Bingo was having her 40th birthday
party I think,

2228
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:09,280
and so we're sisters came out,
her parents were coming out,

2229
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:11,560
everyone was coming out.
She started partying pretty hard.

2230
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:13,360
I think she did too much coke.
She had a seizure,

2231
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:17,680
which has happened before,
but she fell off a step and hit her head

2232
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:23,040
and apparently she was bleeding out of
every orifice of her face and you know,

2233
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:25,690
all they're all,
you know,

2234
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:27,700
Doug's,
everything's a joke there,

2235
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:30,130
but it wasn't.
And uh,

2236
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,480
I was in the car with big J and doug
called and was like,

2237
01:33:32,481 --> 01:33:33,730
hey guys,
it's Doug Stan hope.

2238
01:33:33,731 --> 01:33:34,720
And Jay's like,
why?

2239
01:33:34,721 --> 01:33:35,750
What's up?
Doug's like,

2240
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:39,100
I think Bingo is going to die.
I'm probably not going to make it to the

2241
01:33:39,101 --> 01:33:41,380
end of the world podcast.
And then we were like,

2242
01:33:41,381 --> 01:33:42,214
Whoa,

2243
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:45,400
you could tell he was kind of out of
sorts at the pod.

2244
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:47,140
He was just off.
He was like,

2245
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:49,030
it felt uncomfortable.
He kept leaving,

2246
01:33:49,630 --> 01:33:52,130
you know,
and he was going to say who is,

2247
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:53,980
he was a really audit out by the whole
thing.

2248
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:54,580
Yeah,
he was,

2249
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:56,880
he was really worked up and then I would
talk to him.

2250
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:57,520
I,
I,

2251
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,810
I,
every now and then I'll talk to doug

2252
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,840
late night when we were both drinking
and uh,

2253
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,270
we talked to,
I think we talked for like an hour,

2254
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:06,700
45 minutes and he was just like,
it's,

2255
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:07,370
you know,
it's not going to,

2256
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:09,130
this isn't good,
this isn't how it's going to go.

2257
01:34:09,131 --> 01:34:10,420
And then all of a sudden one day they're
like,

2258
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:13,030
hey,
she started responding and then they're

2259
01:34:13,031 --> 01:34:13,990
like,
hey,

2260
01:34:13,991 --> 01:34:15,340
she's talking,
hey,

2261
01:34:15,341 --> 01:34:16,900
she's playing the guitar.
Hey,

2262
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:19,390
she's doing good.
We're going to have a swallow test and

2263
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:21,370
if we can get the,
we're going to try to get her trait

2264
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:23,470
because that was her problem is her
vocal chords were all fucked up.

2265
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,330
And then they got her tray and then
they're like,

2266
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,390
hey,
there's a trick.

2267
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:29,920
A trick is where the tracheotomy,
where they put a hole in your throat so

2268
01:34:29,921 --> 01:34:33,400
that she doesn't have to use her,
her throat to breathe.

2269
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:35,560
You can just breathe right from your
lungs to the air.

2270
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:37,960
And so then they were like,
you know,

2271
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:39,910
it's going to be some real,
real rehabilitation.

2272
01:34:39,911 --> 01:34:43,210
It's going to take awhile to get her
back to where she was the day of her

2273
01:34:43,211 --> 01:34:46,090
birthday party,
but everything seems to be tracking

2274
01:34:46,091 --> 01:34:47,530
really nicely.
I mean so much.

2275
01:34:47,531 --> 01:34:51,220
So Doug is doug at the date,
like a week before Bingo.

2276
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:53,560
Atarax and Doug called me like late
night and he was like,

2277
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:56,560
do you have $100,000 you can part with?
And I was like,

2278
01:34:56,561 --> 01:34:57,170
yeah,
why?

2279
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:58,130
And he goes,
I gotta

2280
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:01,670
I gotta I have a line on a cave in
Arizona I want to buy will get me,

2281
01:35:01,671 --> 01:35:04,250
you norm Mcdonald.
Joe will get us all in.

2282
01:35:04,251 --> 01:35:05,390
We're going to do it right.
And I was like,

2283
01:35:05,391 --> 01:35:06,560
hey dave,
but you haven't,

2284
01:35:06,561 --> 01:35:08,900
he hasn't texted you about this.
Well I know there's a house that's for

2285
01:35:08,901 --> 01:35:10,860
sale that's built into a cave.
Is that the one?

2286
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:13,910
$2,000,000 is like 10 of us.
100 grand.

2287
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:16,040
We just put it in and then we have our
own cave.

2288
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:19,230
I don't want to go to that cave.
Well that's why we maybe as a texted you

2289
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:21,170
and how's it been for sale for like a
decade.

2290
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:24,230
And so and so.
Then he said he was going to ask for

2291
01:35:24,231 --> 01:35:25,220
medical bills.
Money.

2292
01:35:25,270 --> 01:35:26,500
No,
that makes sense.

2293
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,050
And then last night or night before
last,

2294
01:35:30,051 --> 01:35:31,840
he started talking about the cave again.
So I go,

2295
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:34,420
things must be doing good in the fun
house of Doug wants to go back to the

2296
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:36,830
cave in Mcdonald's,
in Roseanne.

2297
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:39,920
Barr's.
What are they going to do with this

2298
01:35:39,921 --> 01:35:40,850
case?
I don't know,

2299
01:35:40,851 --> 01:35:44,680
but I'm pot committed on a grand book in
my hands.

2300
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:48,260
Like we're not buying a fucking kid.
You're 100 grand into a cave and he

2301
01:35:48,261 --> 01:35:51,110
doesn't want to part with a fucking
plane ticket to parents because he

2302
01:35:51,111 --> 01:35:52,380
thinks you're lying about your height.

2303
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:56,430
He's,
he's gonna.

2304
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:59,720
He's gonna.
Roll back every excuse tomorrow to get

2305
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:01,330
rough.
You can tell them we're six,

2306
01:36:01,331 --> 01:36:02,850
four and he's.
He doesn't care.

2307
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:05,840
I don't bullshit.
God Damn it.

2308
01:36:06,490 --> 01:36:07,800
I'll lose my fucking beard.
I think.

2309
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:08,910
Well,
he's very frugal.

2310
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:10,053
Yeah,
he is.

2311
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:12,420
Oh,
except the reason are going to give away

2312
01:36:12,421 --> 01:36:14,040
money.
You were hearing them on that podcast.

2313
01:36:14,041 --> 01:36:14,640
He was like,
oh,

2314
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:17,430
well I need.
You just went like cool things.

2315
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:20,010
So if you have an idea,
I mean maybe I'll fund it.

2316
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:21,630
So really?
Yeah.

2317
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:22,920
He's like,
I have everything I need.

2318
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:26,460
What ideas would you want to fund?
Like how good would the idea have to be

2319
01:36:26,461 --> 01:36:27,720
before that?
Like I'm like,

2320
01:36:27,721 --> 01:36:31,050
just take this be insanely good.
Yeah.

2321
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:33,210
I don't know if it's like just a
creative project.

2322
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:35,940
People have come up to me with some
really good ideas and I'm like,

2323
01:36:35,941 --> 01:36:36,774
good luck.

2324
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:38,970
I'm not fun and Shit.
Yeah,

2325
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:41,920
I don't it ever excite,
you know?

2326
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:43,520
I don't want to think.
Yeah,

2327
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:45,030
I don't want to.
Here's the thing,

2328
01:36:45,031 --> 01:36:46,530
people go,
it won't be a big deal.

2329
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:48,450
You just give me my,
I'm going to handle it now you know,

2330
01:36:48,451 --> 01:36:50,730
I'm going to think about it cost me
money.

2331
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:54,960
I would rather have less money and not
think about you doing that.

2332
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:58,800
Then to make money from you doing that
because then I have to think like as

2333
01:36:58,801 --> 01:37:02,040
soon as you start,
you complicate your life when you get

2334
01:37:02,041 --> 01:37:05,160
involved in too many endeavors.
I'm already involved in too much shit as

2335
01:37:05,161 --> 01:37:06,990
it is,
but when I say that to people,

2336
01:37:06,991 --> 01:37:09,090
they go,
you're not ever going to stop.

2337
01:37:09,150 --> 01:37:10,830
You still get a lot of pitches all the
time.

2338
01:37:10,831 --> 01:37:12,640
I was with you for it.
What was that?

2339
01:37:12,810 --> 01:37:15,250
Good into it?
We were a member.

2340
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:16,820
A guy met us.
Uh,

2341
01:37:17,190 --> 01:37:19,890
it was arranged and we were in New York
or something.

2342
01:37:19,891 --> 01:37:21,210
He was at the restaurant.
He was like,

2343
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:24,880
I've built like a this city.
Yeah.

2344
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:26,610
And the mountain in the mountains.
Yeah.

2345
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:28,050
Yeah.
And I was there like,

2346
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:32,640
what I'm trying to start selling right
now,

2347
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:34,770
community in the mountain.
And then he was like,

2348
01:37:34,771 --> 01:37:36,720
and here's this.
It's like people like you because we'd

2349
01:37:36,721 --> 01:37:39,590
like to just have you up there and um,
you know,

2350
01:37:39,690 --> 01:37:41,490
on the house,
of course we'll take care of you.

2351
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,890
Your whole family can go and enjoy it.
And I'm like,

2352
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:44,850
yeah.
So,

2353
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:48,990
so that later he buys it like you,
you're giving them a week free and then

2354
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:50,670
now do you want to buy it?
Yeah.

2355
01:37:50,671 --> 01:37:52,090
And he's like trying to say like,
Nah,

2356
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,150
I just want you to enjoy it.
Like so he can buy it,

2357
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:56,040
I think you're going to let him stay
there and

2358
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:00,420
then the more you use me to try to rope
other people in the buying their.

2359
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,490
Yeah,
I mean it was fine.

2360
01:38:02,491 --> 01:38:02,911
I mean,
you know,

2361
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:04,710
the concentrator community,
that's his pitch,

2362
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:08,260
but communities get constructed
naturally.

2363
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:09,420
Yeah.
I've never heard.

2364
01:38:09,421 --> 01:38:12,360
I mean,
I guess it was an upscale community.

2365
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:13,830
Do you remember when you wanted to buy
it,

2366
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:16,170
when you wanted to make a compound up in
Santa Barbara?

2367
01:38:16,171 --> 01:38:19,340
Still do.
By the way,

2368
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,020
that's what land yesterday.
Santa Barbara everywhere.

2369
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,300
I love Santa Barbara trying to get off
the grid son.

2370
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:29,390
Leanne and I are looking at property in
Colorado where right now we're at a

2371
01:38:30,271 --> 01:38:32,010
place where our,
our payments are.

2372
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:35,220
Leanne set it up so that we can be,
we could be poor.

2373
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:39,780
Pay Off your house.
You have your mood stove with a

2374
01:38:39,781 --> 01:38:41,820
mortgage.
We've been talking about Colorado.

2375
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:44,310
You want to buy a house together?
We're in Colorado.

2376
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:45,450
Um,
I like to.

2377
01:38:45,451 --> 01:38:50,451
I personally,
I would like to stay no more than 45 to

2378
01:38:50,791 --> 01:38:54,150
an hour outside of Denver.
Evergreen,

2379
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,073
but up in the,
up,

2380
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:58,110
up like above the,
above the elevation,

2381
01:38:58,111 --> 01:39:00,310
like 7,500 feet.
You've been evergreen?

2382
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,400
No.
Yes.

2383
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:05,170
Evergreens.
A spot where my buddy lives.

2384
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:08,880
They're fucking amazing.
You got to put like a bear like nails up

2385
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:11,490
upside down so the bears don't come in
your fucking house.

2386
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:15,540
You do have to do that sometimes and
they have certain kinds of door knobs.

2387
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:16,460
Like they don't,
they,

2388
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:17,960
you know,
those door knobs that are like,

2389
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:19,700
uh,
like pulled down door knobs.

2390
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:24,570
They don't recommend those bears figure
those fuckers out and they figured out

2391
01:39:24,571 --> 01:39:25,890
how to do.
Let's get a house together.

2392
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,810
You want to do that?
You guys go on gay for each other.

2393
01:39:27,811 --> 01:39:28,620
Look at this.
This will be.

2394
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:30,660
Oh,
this is my dream to bears with bears

2395
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:33,360
like burke.

2396
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:36,420
Are you really looking at that?
Yeah.

2397
01:39:36,421 --> 01:39:38,100
Yeah.
We've talked about yesterday because you

2398
01:39:38,101 --> 01:39:40,830
can get it fairly cheap up there.
Especially if we go halvsies.

2399
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:44,070
Alright.
It's hard to do have to mortgage.

2400
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:47,370
Yeah.
Not knowing even where to start a

2401
01:39:47,371 --> 01:39:51,000
corporation.
A evergreen is fucking beautiful.

2402
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:53,630
It's my favorite.
I think my favorite city to go to

2403
01:39:53,631 --> 01:39:54,710
Denver.
I love them.

2404
01:39:54,711 --> 01:39:55,630
This is the shit.
Yeah,

2405
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:58,440
my sound guy lives up there.
Those people got it made man.

2406
01:39:58,610 --> 01:40:00,360
I mean they're,
they're staring at the rocky mountains

2407
01:40:00,361 --> 01:40:02,010
everyday.
Weed's legal,

2408
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:04,860
real estate prices are through the roof.
Everyone was cool.

2409
01:40:04,861 --> 01:40:07,320
They're so cool.
We're getting so high tomorrow.

2410
01:40:07,930 --> 01:40:08,850
Yeah.
Tomorrow.

2411
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:10,250
So,
um,

2412
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:11,970
how are you guys going to deal with the
rest of the day?

2413
01:40:11,971 --> 01:40:13,830
Do you just get out of here and just
start running?

2414
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:15,450
Like what are you going to do is get on
the treadmill?

2415
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:17,850
I gotta go,
you gotTa.

2416
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:21,240
Go do my horse.
I've got to do one with Joey now.

2417
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:23,670
Is there any concern about the rest of
the day?

2418
01:40:23,671 --> 01:40:24,241
Like,
you know,

2419
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:26,370
this is like,
it's a race that you've.

2420
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:27,890
You're ahead.
Yeah.

2421
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:30,180
But you've got to be careful with 32
ounces.

2422
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:31,420
Oh,
I got to be real careful today.

2423
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:32,640
Look,
Tom.

2424
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:36,180
Tom,
tom is Derek jeter on Mickey Mantle.

2425
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:38,640
He keeps saying this.
Mickey Mantle is Mickey.

2426
01:40:38,641 --> 01:40:41,760
Mantle was a fucking savage.
Wasn't fucking party this whole fucking

2427
01:40:41,761 --> 01:40:42,810
life.
Never show up to a game.

2428
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:45,240
Fucking half sober and stills wondering
who.

2429
01:40:45,241 --> 01:40:46,110
Do you remember more,
Tom?

2430
01:40:46,130 --> 01:40:48,840
Be Honest.
Mickey mantle or Derek Jeter to steal

2431
01:40:48,841 --> 01:40:52,320
from Daniel Tosh.
Just like train wreck stole from Daniel

2432
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,740
Tosh.
I'm trainwreck.

2433
01:40:53,741 --> 01:40:53,980
Stole

2434
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:54,641
from Daniel.
Yeah.

2435
01:40:54,641 --> 01:40:56,050
They did a movie here.
They did.

2436
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:56,501
Fuck.
Yeah,

2437
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:58,810
they did.
They directly stole one of his lines.

2438
01:40:59,070 --> 01:40:59,621
Really?
Yeah.

2439
01:40:59,621 --> 01:41:01,690
He had a bit about Babe Ruth.
He's like,

2440
01:41:01,691 --> 01:41:02,524
yeah.
He goes,

2441
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:05,200
it should be an asterisk next to his
name because he never had to play

2442
01:41:05,201 --> 01:41:08,590
against black eyes talking about babe
ruth never took steroids.

2443
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:11,860
He also never played against black guys
in.

2444
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,690
Daniel tosh had a great bit.
They stole it.

2445
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:16,430
I fucking hate him.
And that tell you this.

2446
01:41:16,690 --> 01:41:19,950
He did it on a show I want to show you
talked about it on the show and there's

2447
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:24,070
a one of the compilations of plagiarism
accusations against Schumer.

2448
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,420
Has that in there.
Wow.

2449
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:26,373
Yeah.
Has a lot.

2450
01:41:26,590 --> 01:41:27,850
By the way,
there's a lot.

2451
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:29,770
There's a new video that's out.
There's a lot.

2452
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:34,450
It gets hairy where you gotta go.
All righty.

2453
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:37,930
Anyway,
Mickey Mantle didn't play against black

2454
01:41:37,931 --> 01:41:38,590
guys.

2455
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:41,580
Or did he make you mantle play against
black guy?

2456
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:44,110
Jackie Robinson.
Well,

2457
01:41:44,111 --> 01:41:45,730
before him.
So you're saying that you're just the

2458
01:41:45,731 --> 01:41:47,380
gunslinger,
but like what you're going to do?

2459
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:49,620
I can already predict tomorrow.
Oh,

2460
01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:52,870
Tommy's going to come in at 2:17,
2:15?

2461
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:55,780
No,
Tommy's going to be about 2:15.

2462
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,240
Yay.
Is Tom's.

2463
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:01,060
Tom has hit his threshold weight.
Still eating chicken.

2464
01:42:01,061 --> 01:42:02,150
I'm not eating anything.
Right,

2465
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:04,300
right.
Probably drank seven pounds of water.

2466
01:42:04,301 --> 01:42:07,270
And you got to understand that like
you're a hold on to more water.

2467
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:10,090
You either one of you guys fucked with
distilled water.

2468
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:11,890
That's all I'd been drinking.

2469
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:18,490
You can't drink too much of that because
it will deplete your body of minerals

2470
01:42:18,491 --> 01:42:19,324
and electrolytes.
Yeah.

2471
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:21,040
Why I didn't look.
I just.

2472
01:42:21,041 --> 01:42:25,810
All I know is that I can run.
I can probably run 20 miles between now

2473
01:42:25,811 --> 01:42:27,400
and then.
That's all I need.

2474
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:31,850
Sort of.
The problem is you.

2475
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:33,790
Boy,
when are you going to do it?

2476
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:35,380
Like when are you going to actually do
it?

2477
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:39,040
Because you literally have to do it
before the wind.

2478
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,600
You can't,
you're not gonna be able to drink

2479
01:42:40,601 --> 01:42:43,270
anything.
Like you have think about like 32

2480
01:42:43,271 --> 01:42:44,290
ounces.
This is what?

2481
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:46,550
Eight ounces?
16.

2482
01:42:46,650 --> 01:42:48,250
16.
These are 16.

2483
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:50,940
These are 32 is right here.
Six to 16 point nine.

2484
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:51,601
Yeah.
Hmm.

2485
01:42:51,601 --> 01:42:53,440
Okay.
So two of these,

2486
01:42:53,441 --> 01:42:55,120
two of these,
two of these.

2487
01:42:55,121 --> 01:42:58,300
He's ahead of you.
Just to have these so you can't fuck

2488
01:42:58,301 --> 01:42:59,790
around.
I don't,

2489
01:43:00,170 --> 01:43:02,080
I don't use math in this.

2490
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:07,680
I use heart long string DNA Strand Dna
Strand Dna was that movie that I saw.

2491
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:11,320
You think you just.
If you just do the run then you'll,

2492
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:13,300
you'll do it.
I'm not going to eat anything either.

2493
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,820
You got to feel like shit.
Nope.

2494
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:18,220
No,
I'm different than you guys.

2495
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:20,860
I got.
I've got that long strand DNA.

2496
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,590
You're different.
How are you different than the focus on

2497
01:43:23,591 --> 01:43:25,000
it?
I focus like I get,

2498
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:28,060
I get hyper aware and I go.
I have a goal.

2499
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:31,430
Like today when I woke up I wanted a
glass of water so bad it was stick for

2500
01:43:31,431 --> 01:43:33,100
him.
Those guys are hilarious.

2501
01:43:33,101 --> 01:43:33,934
That.
Yeah,

2502
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:36,670
it's my mentality.
Dan,

2503
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:38,650
you know how many fucking dummies I've
met?

2504
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:41,720
Tell me they could fight in the UFC.
I know I could beat anybody.

2505
01:43:41,721 --> 01:43:43,480
It's because my mentality,
she was

2506
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:47,950
head kick and fight someone.

2507
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,600
Sorry.
Sorry.

2508
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:55,250
We cheat,
he'll,

2509
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:57,410
we fight Sam pond balls.

2510
01:43:58,270 --> 01:44:00,430
Cm punk will beat the fuck out of the
both of you guys.

2511
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:04,480
Of course he might have gotten his ass
kicked by Micky Gall,

2512
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:06,220
but micky gall is a real fighter.

2513
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,610
Let's be clear here.
Bert said that.

2514
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:12,810
Leave me out of this.
You don't think cm punk will beat your

2515
01:44:12,811 --> 01:44:13,561
ass?
Dude,

2516
01:44:13,561 --> 01:44:14,940
I don't know enough.
I'm just joking.

2517
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:16,860
I don't fucking know anything about cm
punk.

2518
01:44:16,861 --> 01:44:20,250
I've never knew him when he was a famous
that we should fight,

2519
01:44:20,251 --> 01:44:21,650
right?
Yeah.

2520
01:44:21,651 --> 01:44:22,380
Yeah.
Let's fight.

2521
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:26,220
No,
not owen fight you.

2522
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:27,660
Let's see.
We can gain the most weight next.

2523
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:29,230
Oh No,
no,

2524
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:30,063
no,
no,

2525
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:31,690
no.
You guys gotta.

2526
01:44:31,710 --> 01:44:34,030
See this gotta be like the new,
you know,

2527
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:37,090
can you make this happen though?
Like what are you thinking after?

2528
01:44:37,091 --> 01:44:42,091
This is over six months.
That's what if we weighed in April first

2529
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:46,510
and July first,
so three months and then six months.

2530
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:47,620
Well,
here's the thing.

2531
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:50,020
This is the right way to do it.
And you and I talked about this.

2532
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:55,410
The right way to do this is you have a
way in every 12 weeks or every,

2533
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:58,240
uh,
every month for 12 months,

2534
01:44:58,510 --> 01:45:02,650
every four weeks,
and at the end of the year you tally up

2535
01:45:02,651 --> 01:45:04,600
a score,
like a race to 12,

2536
01:45:04,890 --> 01:45:09,100
like see who wins each month.
So the only way to,

2537
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:13,270
to really do it would be like you would
have to actually lose body weight.

2538
01:45:13,271 --> 01:45:16,900
You couldn't just dehydrate yourself
every month and go under because if one

2539
01:45:16,901 --> 01:45:18,970
of you keeps going,
like say if you guys had to do it,

2540
01:45:18,971 --> 01:45:21,640
like if I was in on the challenge and
you guys have to do it against me,

2541
01:45:21,641 --> 01:45:25,930
I'm 19 pounds lighter than the heaviest
or other than the lightest guy right

2542
01:45:25,931 --> 01:45:26,260
now.

2543
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:29,290
So I would already have an advantage.
So if I just started losing more and

2544
01:45:29,291 --> 01:45:31,450
more weight,
you would have to lose body weight in

2545
01:45:31,451 --> 01:45:34,550
order to be in the race.
You can't just lose 19 pounds of body

2546
01:45:34,551 --> 01:45:36,310
weight every month like that.
You wouldn't be able to do it.

2547
01:45:36,550 --> 01:45:41,550
So if you started today and then every
month you guys had a way in challenge,

2548
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:44,920
the number would drop every month.
Like it's two,

2549
01:45:44,921 --> 01:45:46,250
19 now,
next month.

2550
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:46,901
Probably like two.
Oh,

2551
01:45:46,901 --> 01:45:49,490
seven next month it would be like to,
you know,

2552
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:54,010
a tool one and then you would keep going
and going and going until you guys were

2553
01:45:54,011 --> 01:45:56,320
skinny as fuck.
You guys will be like bodybuilders by

2554
01:45:56,321 --> 01:45:57,154
the end of the year?

2555
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:58,140
I don't think.
I don't think.

2556
01:45:58,141 --> 01:45:59,060
I don't mean I,
I'm,

2557
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:01,320
I'm not saying I'm sure I'd probably
love being what?

2558
01:46:01,321 --> 01:46:02,970
80 six really?
I mean,

2559
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:04,080
I'm not saying I'm not,
I'm not,

2560
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:05,940
I wasn't about to say that.
I was going to say sure,

2561
01:46:05,941 --> 01:46:09,510
I'd love it.
But personally I think to fifteens a

2562
01:46:09,511 --> 01:46:11,970
really great weight for me.
I know it's still overweight,

2563
01:46:12,270 --> 01:46:14,160
but like you,
but you don't want to be overweight.

2564
01:46:14,161 --> 01:46:15,540
Right?
I don't want to be overweight,

2565
01:46:15,541 --> 01:46:19,530
but I also don't want to look.
I don't want to look like this.

2566
01:46:20,090 --> 01:46:22,050
I'd,
well I'd love to be fucking yoked,

2567
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:25,890
but I don't know if I have the fucking.
I like crossfit.

2568
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:27,570
I've been doing crossfit,
see it,

2569
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:32,400
and I had to stop because I was afraid I
was building up too much mass because

2570
01:46:32,401 --> 01:46:33,780
you're putting on too much weight.
I was like,

2571
01:46:33,781 --> 01:46:35,100
I was like,
this is a weight loss challenge.

2572
01:46:35,101 --> 01:46:37,230
Any weight that comes in and muscle I
don't want.

2573
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:39,870
I'm just going to run my actually can
ask about the same thing.

2574
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:40,980
I,
like I said,

2575
01:46:40,981 --> 01:46:42,230
I've always,
you know,

2576
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:46,620
done weightlifting at my heaviest and
like six,

2577
01:46:46,621 --> 01:46:47,920
eight weeks ago I was like,
oh,

2578
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:48,900
I fucking,
I haven't done.

2579
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:49,980
It feels weird.
I

2580
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,670
actually feel,
feel somewhat like different that I

2581
01:46:53,671 --> 01:46:55,290
haven't touched weights.
Yeah,

2582
01:46:55,291 --> 01:46:58,530
I mean it makes a big difference and
then the only way to keep the weight off

2583
01:46:58,531 --> 01:47:00,530
while you're doing that you'd have to do
like lightweight,

2584
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:02,820
low reps,
but you're still a weight high reps,

2585
01:47:02,821 --> 01:47:03,060
right?
Yeah.

2586
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:03,730
I'm sorry.
Light,

2587
01:47:03,730 --> 01:47:05,390
lightweight high reps.
yeah.

2588
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:07,080
Yeah.
And I thought about that and I know some

2589
01:47:07,081 --> 01:47:08,970
people are going to tell them like
that's what you should have done.

2590
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,910
You would allow us more,
but I kind of just pick the fuck anyone

2591
01:47:11,911 --> 01:47:15,750
with any insights or weight loss.
It's a pedestrian like I hate when they

2592
01:47:15,751 --> 01:47:17,310
go.
Listen,

2593
01:47:17,311 --> 01:47:18,900
man,
if you're not eating a lot of calories,

2594
01:47:18,901 --> 01:47:20,670
your body is going to backfire.
Start storing fat.

2595
01:47:20,671 --> 01:47:22,890
Fuck you.
Tell that to the kids in Ethiopia.

2596
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:24,960
Well,
if you don't eat your fucking lose.

2597
01:47:24,961 --> 01:47:26,940
Fucking wait.
That's how that fucking works.

2598
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:29,400
If you burn more calories than you take
in,

2599
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,330
your body has a certain reaction and
that's how that fucking works.

2600
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:36,810
He's done in a scientific route that
he's put his body into a state of

2601
01:47:36,811 --> 01:47:39,760
ketosis.
He's cut out all the sugar and the carbs

2602
01:47:39,761 --> 01:47:42,870
and now his body's burning fat.
I think I might've done that too,

2603
01:47:42,871 --> 01:47:45,460
except for the vodka sodas.
Yeah,

2604
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:47,190
they'll.
They'll stop you from really getting

2605
01:47:47,191 --> 01:47:50,190
into ketosis of the alcohol will do.
You have one of those sticks.

2606
01:47:50,191 --> 01:47:52,210
You can piss on a stick sticks.
Yeah.

2607
01:47:52,410 --> 01:47:54,240
This stuff is key.
Jenny.

2608
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:57,030
This is exogenous ketones.
You take this stuff,

2609
01:47:57,031 --> 01:48:01,320
it puts you into like you could drink a
fucking Dr Pepper and then you take this

2610
01:48:01,321 --> 01:48:04,050
stuff and it'll put you into a state
where your body is burning fat,

2611
01:48:04,051 --> 01:48:05,520
not carbohydrates.
Hold on.

2612
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:07,380
You're telling me if I put that in a
vodka soda,

2613
01:48:07,410 --> 01:48:09,250
it was just immediately burning that
sugar telling.

2614
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:11,700
If you take a vodka soda and then take
this afterwards,

2615
01:48:11,701 --> 01:48:13,830
I wouldn't mix the two of them together.
I don't think that's smart,

2616
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:17,190
but drink this afterwards.
You're back on track.

2617
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:18,630
Oh,
you do?

2618
01:48:18,631 --> 01:48:20,160
Yeah,
you can get right back on track.

2619
01:48:20,161 --> 01:48:20,994
Yeah,
for sure.

2620
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:22,820
Until the company to hit me up.
Yeah.

2621
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:23,910
No,
they're not going to

2622
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:31,530
know we're doing for actual healthy
people

2623
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:38,070
like you don't.
This is what,

2624
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:40,590
where it's crazy.
It's like you're on the door to looking

2625
01:48:40,591 --> 01:48:42,330
great.
Like you're right there and you're

2626
01:48:42,331 --> 01:48:44,520
already ready to fucking go run back
into the woods.

2627
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:47,680
You're like door.
You are.

2628
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:51,750
It's your mindset is like this is
temporary,

2629
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:54,610
but you guys have totally different
mindset.

2630
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:59,460
Your mindset is
definitely starve yourself.

2631
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:01,560
Go at it like a fucking savage.
I mean,

2632
01:49:01,561 --> 01:49:02,790
look you,
you had gloves.

2633
01:49:02,791 --> 01:49:04,350
You came in here with gloves for your
hands.

2634
01:49:04,351 --> 01:49:05,184
Could sweat.

2635
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:08,040
You have your gloves here.
Maniac.

2636
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:11,190
And then Tom is.
I did two miles yesterday,

2637
01:49:11,191 --> 01:49:11,850
man.
That's it.

2638
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:12,950
You know,
two miles.

2639
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:16,800
Two miles in the coliseum.
Yeah.

2640
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:19,470
Yeah.
So there's a totally different mindsets.

2641
01:49:19,471 --> 01:49:23,790
Yours is like extreme short term,
but unsustainable.

2642
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,980
Everything he's doing is totally
sustainable.

2643
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:27,540
Yeah.
I'm curious to see what it would be

2644
01:49:27,541 --> 01:49:29,640
like.
My body had 2000 calories a day,

2645
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:32,330
but what all that.
You can do that,

2646
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:34,800
but you like when you get down to a
certain weight,

2647
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:37,680
you don't want that because then your
body's gonna start eating it's muscle.

2648
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:39,960
That's what happens when your body gets
to a certain stages.

2649
01:49:39,961 --> 01:49:41,700
We have to understand about losing
weight.

2650
01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:44,730
If you,
if your body doesn't have the amount of

2651
01:49:44,731 --> 01:49:47,770
protein that it needs,
you start consuming your own muscle.

2652
01:49:47,890 --> 01:49:48,040
I've

2653
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,930
been eating.
I've been eating proteins and greens.

2654
01:49:49,931 --> 01:49:50,690
That's it.
That's good.

2655
01:49:50,690 --> 01:49:51,790
No carbs,
no breads,

2656
01:49:51,791 --> 01:49:54,430
no pastas.
Beans is the only carb I've had.

2657
01:49:54,431 --> 01:49:57,550
I've only had that twice in a month.
You can up that a little bit.

2658
01:49:58,030 --> 01:49:59,380
Yeah,
but when you think about like,

2659
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:00,360
I'm going to be,
you know,

2660
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:02,470
I'm only going to take in 2000 calories
a day.

2661
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:03,970
I want to do this.
You will lose weight,

2662
01:50:03,971 --> 01:50:07,030
but you also lose strength.
You feel exhausted.

2663
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:09,610
Your body starts.
I had that dinner last night,

2664
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:12,490
that big dinner last night,
and when I go on the treadmill I felt

2665
01:50:12,491 --> 01:50:17,170
fucking phenomenal like I got on there
and literally it was like 10 miles or

2666
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:19,510
seven miles.
No rush of energy,

2667
01:50:19,511 --> 01:50:20,920
sugar,
everything from that.

2668
01:50:20,921 --> 01:50:22,540
Yeah,
but that might have fucked you.

2669
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:24,850
You might've been two pounds lighter if
you didn't do that.

2670
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:27,550
No Shit.
He might do it to the impulse.

2671
01:50:27,650 --> 01:50:29,700
Yeah,
and I noticed that that was my bed,

2672
01:50:29,701 --> 01:50:31,540
so I was betting on that.
Yeah,

2673
01:50:31,610 --> 01:50:35,470
that's the bet was he was saying that
you are just going to wait until the

2674
01:50:35,471 --> 01:50:40,471
last minute and go crazy.
That's exactly what Graham and I said

2675
01:50:40,571 --> 01:50:42,760
that by the way a month ago I knew that
you were going to do,

2676
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:45,490
but if you're disciplined wasn't on
point and he still would have.

2677
01:50:45,491 --> 01:50:46,330
Got You.
That's true.

2678
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:48,460
We got down to two of these fucking
things,

2679
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:50,980
two little bottles of water,
which is pretty amazing.

2680
01:50:50,981 --> 01:50:53,920
Yeah.
So you have to win tomorrow.

2681
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:58,270
If to win,
you have to be two and a half pounds or

2682
01:50:58,271 --> 01:50:59,440
more.
Less than me.

2683
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:02,500
Yeah.
So you might be able to lose even more,

2684
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:05,500
like if you go fucking crazy today and
you'd go Bert Kreischer.

2685
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:07,960
So the thing is you guys have narrowed
it down,

2686
01:51:07,961 --> 01:51:11,650
this victory is down to 24 hours or less
now.

2687
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:15,460
But if you go fucking crazy and go full
bird all day today,

2688
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:18,910
[inaudible],
he's almost like you can't catch it.

2689
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:20,620
He doesn't,
he doesn't have that gene.

2690
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:24,220
But what is that long Strand Dna,
Mickey Mantle genes.

2691
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:27,690
Nonsense gene.
This,

2692
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:31,030
this is just discipline.
It's the thing like,

2693
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:34,900
like I've thought about this a lot.
The thing that makes this contest

2694
01:51:34,901 --> 01:51:38,650
interesting is also the reason we like
each other because he is very even

2695
01:51:38,651 --> 01:51:41,710
keeled and I am fucking all over the
map.

2696
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,990
I have a combination of the.
Both of you guys,

2697
01:51:43,991 --> 01:51:45,030
but you definitely.
You have,

2698
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:47,590
you have,
you have the same brain I have about

2699
01:51:47,591 --> 01:51:49,450
like the way you shoot bows and arrows
and you're like,

2700
01:51:49,490 --> 01:51:51,160
that's right.
I'll just do that for three hours until

2701
01:51:51,161 --> 01:51:54,170
I need maybe need shoulder surgery.
You know like,

2702
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:54,930
and,
and,

2703
01:51:54,930 --> 01:51:56,860
or the way you shoot pool.
Like you're very,

2704
01:51:57,010 --> 01:51:58,690
like,
you get obsessed with things,

2705
01:51:58,691 --> 01:51:59,870
you're like,
that's why I can't fuck with drawing

2706
01:51:59,871 --> 01:52:01,060
anymore because I get obsessed with it.

2707
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:02,610
I get like that.
Tom.

2708
01:52:02,611 --> 01:52:05,680
So even killed,
like the perfect example of our

2709
01:52:05,681 --> 01:52:09,550
relationship is that first day we were
in Hawaii and I shaved your tits.

2710
01:52:09,630 --> 01:52:13,000
Yeah.
And it is the funniest Joe.

2711
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:17,590
It is the funniest fucking thing I've
ever been a part of my life.

2712
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:21,790
And he goes to Hawaii and he's like,
and he's out there.

2713
01:52:21,791 --> 01:52:22,301
I go,
Oh man,

2714
01:52:22,301 --> 01:52:23,200
you know Tom's hair.
I go,

2715
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:25,000
hey,
why don't I shave your back for you?

2716
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:26,410
And he was like,
you think?

2717
01:52:26,810 --> 01:52:27,850
Yeah.
And so I started.

2718
01:52:28,330 --> 01:52:31,630
I started to put the volume on this.
This is just,

2719
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:32,441
Oh,
don't put the volume.

2720
01:52:32,441 --> 01:52:36,910
You can hear music on it and friends,
Charlie and Laurel stand by and support

2721
01:52:36,970 --> 01:52:41,970
and your shaving Tom's back.
I'm shaving his back and then at some

2722
01:52:42,101 --> 01:52:45,620
point in this,
and you can just skip ahead at some

2723
01:52:45,621 --> 01:52:46,010
point in this,

2724
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:50,000
I realized that Tom's tit hair connects
with his underarm hair and I go,

2725
01:52:50,001 --> 01:52:51,830
hey buddy.
Wanting to hear a pause right there.

2726
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:55,130
I realized I go,
Hey man,

2727
01:52:55,131 --> 01:52:57,080
let me hollow that out for you.
I go,

2728
01:52:57,081 --> 01:52:59,900
you know what I'll do is I'll trim out
contour,

2729
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:03,170
contour it and make your,
make it so your tid has defined hair and

2730
01:53:03,171 --> 01:53:05,270
you're under on has defined here,
but they're not connected like a

2731
01:53:05,271 --> 01:53:07,730
werewolf and then I'll seize her out
your breasts,

2732
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:10,370
like I'll do a seasonal comin down and
align it up so it looks like you're

2733
01:53:10,371 --> 01:53:14,690
defined and he sold it like real serious
and by the way,

2734
01:53:15,550 --> 01:53:20,360
you've got to
Tom's ernest face staring at me as I do

2735
01:53:20,361 --> 01:53:23,270
this and I'm close to it and I'm looking
at him and I'm trimming it.

2736
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:26,630
And then as I pulled back I still see
Tom's earnest face going,

2737
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:27,493
does it look good?

2738
01:53:29,330 --> 01:53:34,330
And all I see it looks like his tits are
wearing sunglasses and then I realized

2739
01:53:34,721 --> 01:53:35,070
this

2740
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:38,550
first of like seven days in Hawaii and
he's got to look like this the whole

2741
01:53:38,551 --> 01:53:40,890
fucking time.
And I never seen him laugh.

2742
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:42,630
I thought I was having a stroke.

2743
01:53:51,030 --> 01:53:53,290
You have less body hair back then?
Yeah.

2744
01:53:53,291 --> 01:53:55,660
I know you've gained body hair as you
got older.

2745
01:53:55,661 --> 01:53:58,900
That's even weirder.
What year is this?

2746
01:53:59,070 --> 01:53:59,903
Oh,
a

2747
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:03,580
gain.
So much body hair in eight years.

2748
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:05,320
I don't know.
It's weird

2749
01:54:12,370 --> 01:54:15,190
looking serious.
Tom Is looking all serious.

2750
01:54:15,191 --> 01:54:17,390
Thomas,
are you gonna?

2751
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:23,140
Watch me watch it looks terrible
because it makes her look bigger.

2752
01:54:28,391 --> 01:54:33,391
You shaved my head,
shaved under it.

2753
01:54:43,811 --> 01:54:47,680
But you left the hair above it.
So it's like you have like breastplates.

2754
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:50,860
Yeah,
it is the I've,

2755
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:55,440
I've never laughed that hard in that
whole trip is probably me.

2756
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:58,440
Tom and push and Leanne became friends.
Well that's what I knew we could be

2757
01:54:58,441 --> 01:54:59,180
friends

2758
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:02,240
is because then our wives became good.
Yeah,

2759
01:55:02,450 --> 01:55:04,070
that is hilarious.
What you did.

2760
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:11,120
That one looks normal.
So Tom,

2761
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:13,850
what year did you come to la?
Oh,

2762
01:55:13,851 --> 01:55:16,640
two.
So in six years you put on all that

2763
01:55:16,641 --> 01:55:17,474
weight?
Yeah,

2764
01:55:18,610 --> 01:55:20,720
but I also,
I,

2765
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:24,830
that's how I graduated high school and
went into college like that.

2766
01:55:24,831 --> 01:55:27,710
Weight and then I lost all that weight.
How'd you do that?

2767
01:55:27,950 --> 01:55:29,600
Diet and exercise.
Really?

2768
01:55:29,650 --> 01:55:31,570
Yeah.
And then what made you abandon it?

2769
01:55:31,810 --> 01:55:32,601
I,
it was slow.

2770
01:55:32,601 --> 01:55:36,740
It was a slow crawl like I got here.
I remember when I was working the night

2771
01:55:36,741 --> 01:55:41,210
shift at a post production place,
it was like all the sudden,

2772
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:42,740
I mean it wasn't all of a sudden,
but like,

2773
01:55:42,741 --> 01:55:43,980
you know,
late night food,

2774
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:45,870
late night food,
really weird hours,

2775
01:55:45,871 --> 01:55:49,550
like staying up until four or 5:00 AM
doing the graveyard shift and then going

2776
01:55:49,551 --> 01:55:51,840
to bed and all of a sudden you're like,
I'm up to 25.

2777
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:53,250
Oh Shit.
I thought it was two.

2778
01:55:53,251 --> 01:55:54,084
Oh five.
Like,

2779
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:56,310
you know what I mean?
Like you put on 20 pounds over the

2780
01:55:56,311 --> 01:55:58,230
course of like a,
you know,

2781
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:02,250
a couple of shows in production and then
you're not even thinking about it.

2782
01:56:02,370 --> 01:56:07,370
And then at that point to 25 rolls into
2:30 real easy,

2783
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:08,430
you know,
it's just,

2784
01:56:08,430 --> 01:56:09,840
it's a slow thing.
But it took,

2785
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:15,530
I would say I got here in 2002 by 2005.
I was 2:25.

2786
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:20,660
Now you don't seem to be looking at the
same way he's looking at.

2787
01:56:20,690 --> 01:56:22,940
He's looking at it like this is like a
race.

2788
01:56:23,210 --> 01:56:26,750
You hit the finish line and then you
gorge and then the fucking is over.

2789
01:56:27,350 --> 01:56:29,960
You seem to be like adjusting your life.

2790
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:34,170
Well I think,
I mean I definitely want to have a new

2791
01:56:34,410 --> 01:56:36,530
ceiling of what is,
you know,

2792
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:38,760
an acceptable wait and,
and I,

2793
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:42,030
I definitely feel like this is a very
livable way.

2794
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:44,250
What I've been doing like for the last
few months.

2795
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:46,710
I mean this last week is a little
crazier obviously,

2796
01:56:46,711 --> 01:56:50,250
but the last few,
the last month has been,

2797
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,780
it hasn't been that difficult

2798
01:56:51,980 --> 01:56:53,660
to what?
Like how much weight have you been

2799
01:56:53,661 --> 01:56:55,520
losing a month?
Have you been noticing?

2800
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:59,480
Yeah,
I mean this has been about 10 pounds.

2801
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:02,180
Twelve pounds a month.
That's a lot.

2802
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:04,550
But it's doable.
It's doable and it's not.

2803
01:57:04,580 --> 01:57:07,340
I'm not,
I'm not killing myself suffering to do

2804
01:57:07,341 --> 01:57:10,700
it.
Like I'm just on top of the eating and I

2805
01:57:10,701 --> 01:57:11,480
just,
I do.

2806
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:13,370
I've been doing cardio about six days a
week.

2807
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:15,910
Now if you get to a certain point,
are you,

2808
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:18,140
what do you do?
Like are you going to like,

2809
01:57:18,190 --> 01:57:19,360
eat more?
Like what,

2810
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:21,490
what?
What's the weight where you go,

2811
01:57:21,491 --> 01:57:22,960
okay.
I don't want to lose any more weight.

2812
01:57:22,961 --> 01:57:25,900
I think is less about the number.
Even though we get so obsessed with the

2813
01:57:25,901 --> 01:57:26,650
numbers,
right,

2814
01:57:26,650 --> 01:57:28,450
and like the way you feel about,
you know,

2815
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:29,141
like,
right,

2816
01:57:29,141 --> 01:57:31,810
like it especially if you start lifting
weights again and you put on a little

2817
01:57:31,811 --> 01:57:33,730
bit weight,
your body fats lower.

2818
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:34,150
Yeah.

2819
01:57:34,150 --> 01:57:36,280
So I mean like I'm trying not to be
obsessed with the number,

2820
01:57:36,281 --> 01:57:40,420
but I know like I would want to lose if
we were talking about the number,

2821
01:57:41,050 --> 01:57:44,350
like 15 to 20 more pounds,
which I think is really.

2822
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:45,513
I think so.

2823
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,030
I like to lose six pounds more.
I'd like to,

2824
01:57:48,031 --> 01:57:51,510
I'd like to get to 15 and then maintain
and eat healthy and eat clean.

2825
01:57:51,530 --> 01:57:52,351
Yeah.
But I also,

2826
01:57:52,351 --> 01:57:55,080
you know,
I mean I can't lie about this and say

2827
01:57:55,690 --> 01:57:57,840
this is a lifestyle like the people on
the biggest loser.

2828
01:57:58,020 --> 01:57:59,400
Legit.
I love,

2829
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:01,590
I love fucking hot wings.
I love hot wings.

2830
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:04,640
I love Buffalo Wild Wings and I love the
feeling of like,

2831
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:08,130
like I remember I told you a long time
ago that my weight loss program was to

2832
01:58:08,131 --> 01:58:13,131
stop eating appetizers like advertisers.
I love when I make it rain appetizers.

2833
01:58:14,311 --> 01:58:18,510
I love that feeling and I,
I miss blimpie sandwiches,

2834
01:58:18,511 --> 01:58:20,640
I Miss Pizza.
My girls have been eaten pizza and I'm

2835
01:58:20,641 --> 01:58:22,530
eating cauliflower pizza,
which I like.

2836
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:24,220
But what's cauliflower pizza?
Oh,

2837
01:58:24,221 --> 01:58:26,340
it's good.
You take a 12 ounces of cauliflower,

2838
01:58:26,341 --> 01:58:28,440
you steam it in the microwave for like
four minutes.

2839
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,360
You dry it out,
you put one egg in there,

2840
01:58:30,361 --> 01:58:35,040
a third cup of Mozzarella that I'm like
a fourth cup of Parmesan and you put it

2841
01:58:35,041 --> 01:58:36,870
into a,
that's your crust and then you put it in

2842
01:58:36,871 --> 01:58:38,060
the oven.
It's,

2843
01:58:38,670 --> 01:58:40,880
every slice is very low calories because
it's cauliflower.

2844
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:42,310
All really eating is like a portion

2845
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:44,800
of an egg and some Mozzarella.
It's really fucking good.

2846
01:58:45,210 --> 01:58:46,020
Um,
I'll,

2847
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:48,340
I'll make something if you wanted to
bring it in tomorrow and we can try it.

2848
01:58:48,980 --> 01:58:49,650
Yeah,
I'll try that.

2849
01:58:49,650 --> 01:58:51,370
I think after awhile though,
you.

2850
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:53,530
I mean,
I don't miss that many things.

2851
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:54,820
You know,
food wise,

2852
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:59,440
the really hard thing for really is a
shift in the way you live the shift

2853
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:01,190
shift.
What you think about.

2854
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:04,700
I have a waffle date tomorrow with my
wife because we're having waffles going

2855
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:08,260
to go.
I found a place that in the morning.

2856
01:59:08,261 --> 01:59:09,100
First thing in the morning.
Yeah,

2857
01:59:09,101 --> 01:59:12,020
right before the wind.
So wait.

2858
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:14,020
So wait,
did you really didn't eat those cookies

2859
01:59:14,021 --> 01:59:14,854
at all?
Not,

2860
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:15,760
not even.
I've been.

2861
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:16,870
Oh,
I didn't even open the box.

2862
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:19,720
Here's some cookies.
Discipline.

2863
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:21,190
I send them cookies,
discipline,

2864
01:59:21,210 --> 01:59:22,900
Lewin's races,
impulse doesn't win.

2865
01:59:22,901 --> 01:59:26,920
Races a impulse.
Does those wins races.

2866
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:29,380
It didn't win today.
I know,

2867
01:59:29,381 --> 01:59:34,210
but it definitely shocked.
Impulse impulses get results,

2868
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:37,450
but they don't get the best results.
The best results are gone through

2869
01:59:37,451 --> 01:59:40,810
discipline.
My manager's got pissed about this whole

2870
01:59:40,811 --> 01:59:43,720
weight loss thing is I'm in the middle
of it scripted deal.

2871
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:46,090
And uh,
I wasn't sending him scripts.

2872
01:59:46,091 --> 01:59:48,490
I was just fucking around with Tom.
And they're like,

2873
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:50,050
they're like,
they call it the end.

2874
01:59:50,051 --> 01:59:50,620
They're like,
hey,

2875
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:53,500
he needs to like take all your wife.
They're like,

2876
01:59:53,501 --> 01:59:55,060
back the fuck off of that.
They were like,

2877
01:59:55,061 --> 01:59:56,890
Hey,
what's Bert is like,

2878
01:59:56,891 --> 01:59:58,690
seems to be obsessed about this weight
loss thing.

2879
01:59:58,691 --> 02:00:01,920
Like we've got a TV show we're trying to
make like Atlanta,

2880
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:02,231
like,
oh,

2881
02:00:02,231 --> 02:00:04,960
you don't understand burt,
like he will never work on this TV show.

2882
02:00:04,961 --> 02:00:07,090
If you don't,
if you don't respect the fact that this

2883
02:00:07,091 --> 02:00:09,390
is what he's focused on,
so what I was doing was I was,

2884
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:10,540
I was setting up accounts.

2885
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:12,640
It didn't work out right,
but I was setting up accounts at

2886
02:00:12,641 --> 02:00:17,470
different food places so they could,
that fans could send Tom Food and I was

2887
02:00:17,471 --> 02:00:19,030
like,
I wasted a whole day,

2888
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:20,950
and then I sent him these cookies that
were amazing.

2889
02:00:20,951 --> 02:00:23,260
I sent him to my daughters.
They loved him and I said,

2890
02:00:23,261 --> 02:00:25,300
I'm from the rock to tom and tom didn't
even eat them.

2891
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:27,360
He just gave him the fucking people
working on his brand new,

2892
02:00:27,370 --> 02:00:32,170
a $3,000,000 house,
but they're good cookies.

2893
02:00:32,171 --> 02:00:37,171
I want to try them when I get done.
You're already thinking about wings and

2894
02:00:37,211 --> 02:00:40,570
cookies and pizza and this and.
But I'm already thinking about.

2895
02:00:40,810 --> 02:00:43,330
I'm also thinking about the long Strand
Dna,

2896
02:00:43,331 --> 02:00:46,210
mickey mantle jeans I could find.
Anybody

2897
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:49,360
got that mentality,
Bro.

2898
02:00:49,390 --> 02:00:51,460
I just can't lose.
I'm different.

2899
02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:53,050
Everybody wants to think they're
different,

2900
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:55,270
but everybody does.
Everybody does.

2901
02:00:55,510 --> 02:00:57,970
Including the people that you think
you're different from,

2902
02:00:58,150 --> 02:00:59,380
they think they're different.

2903
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:00,880
Yeah.
Everybody thinks they're different.

2904
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:03,640
That's what gets people knocked the fuck
out.

2905
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:05,650
That's Hashtag [inaudible] the return.
Yeah.

2906
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:06,920
That's what that is.
No,

2907
02:01:06,970 --> 02:01:09,430
I'm not real.
That's like Ronda Rousey's idea was that

2908
02:01:09,431 --> 02:01:11,230
she's different than everybody.
You know,

2909
02:01:11,290 --> 02:01:13,450
everybody.
I'm the best in the world that people

2910
02:01:13,451 --> 02:01:16,780
love to have that and sometimes you win
and you really do feel like you are

2911
02:01:16,781 --> 02:01:20,290
that,
but the reality is you are a skeleton

2912
02:01:20,291 --> 02:01:24,880
and some fucking cells and you're run by
a central nervous system and your brain

2913
02:01:24,881 --> 02:01:29,020
has a whole bunch of defense mechanisms
that are designed to protect you from

2914
02:01:29,021 --> 02:01:32,470
reality.
And one of those is that it decides I'm

2915
02:01:32,471 --> 02:01:36,100
different in these motherfuckers.
Don't you fucking agree with them just

2916
02:01:36,101 --> 02:01:37,900
because you're sitting there,
but you know it's true.

2917
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:39,650
I know that.
I know that's how you think

2918
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,170
it is.
It's a real.

2919
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:44,300
It's a problem.
I knew that he was really like,

2920
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:47,360
I'm going to run 28 miles.
How many people,

2921
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:50,210
how many people?
Especially beautiful girls,

2922
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:53,560
how many beautiful girls just think
they're fucking special because we were

2923
02:01:53,730 --> 02:01:55,820
talking about that.
We were talking about that today,

2924
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:57,590
about the um,
the,

2925
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:03,040
the horror and the danger of daddy's
that especially that kind of,

2926
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:07,490
you know,
push the princess ideal on their girls

2927
02:02:07,780 --> 02:02:12,710
and that make them think that they're so
special and then that girl kind of seeks

2928
02:02:12,711 --> 02:02:14,090
that out,
you know,

2929
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:18,350
and he leaves that.
And then what are the type of guy that

2930
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:21,260
does go for that?
Usually if he's romantically is

2931
02:02:21,261 --> 02:02:23,880
basically a paternal figure to that girl
who,

2932
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:26,510
if he's going to still see her as a
princess,

2933
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:28,420
you know,
princesses are weird.

2934
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:31,130
It's a weird thing that everybody wants
to be a princess.

2935
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:32,350
So weird.
And you see,

2936
02:02:32,510 --> 02:02:34,070
you start to see that it's fucked up.
I actually,

2937
02:02:34,071 --> 02:02:37,190
I remember being in high school and like
seeing girls who are like,

2938
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:41,510
I'm the most special and you go like,
and I better respect that I'm the most

2939
02:02:41,511 --> 02:02:42,260
special.
Yeah.

2940
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:43,580
If you don't,
someone will,

2941
02:02:43,610 --> 02:02:44,770
you're not going to find that guy.
Yeah.

2942
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:48,470
And that'll be your second daddy.
I am more important than anything in

2943
02:02:48,471 --> 02:02:49,200
your life.
Yeah.

2944
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:52,160
Period.
To carve out time for me.

2945
02:02:52,910 --> 02:02:53,990
You've had that speech,
Huh?

2946
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:56,210
Oh yeah.
The carve out time for me speech.

2947
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:59,930
I ran into a chick one time that I think
you'd had relations with.

2948
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:04,530
How dare you.
Let's not even discuss it off the air.

2949
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:09,560
I've had too many bad situations in my
life where someone thinks they're

2950
02:03:09,561 --> 02:03:10,490
special.
Yeah.

2951
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:11,690
It gets.
It gets.

2952
02:03:12,230 --> 02:03:16,370
It gets at a certain point in time.
You have to blame yourself for getting

2953
02:03:16,371 --> 02:03:17,540
involved with those people though.

2954
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:21,440
Let's let's work this backwards.
Like I think Cameron Hanes,

2955
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:24,320
the ability that he can run those ultra
marathons,

2956
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:26,510
that's special.
He'd be able to.

2957
02:03:26,511 --> 02:03:28,100
If you meet that guy,
let me tell you something.

2958
02:03:28,610 --> 02:03:30,430
He would be the last person to call
them.

2959
02:03:30,431 --> 02:03:31,410
So special.
But.

2960
02:03:31,450 --> 02:03:33,980
But he's all discipline.
We could agree that him,

2961
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:38,690
a guy like him or like conor Mcgregor.
Let me give me a cameron hanes speech.

2962
02:03:38,810 --> 02:03:41,510
Cameron Hanes was about 180 plus.
Okay.

2963
02:03:41,511 --> 02:03:42,770
Like lifting weights,
all that jazz.

2964
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:48,160
And he wanted to run the 200 miles.
So what he did was he got down to 165

2965
02:03:49,490 --> 02:03:53,570
and the way he did it was burning 3000
calories,

2966
02:03:53,810 --> 02:03:57,170
eating 2000 calories.
So he never stopped working out,

2967
02:03:57,460 --> 02:04:00,620
he was running like a fucking maniac and
he led his body eat itself.

2968
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:02,870
So he just got,
he just shrunk.

2969
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:06,440
I got watched it happen and all the
sudden you'll just different like he

2970
02:04:06,441 --> 02:04:08,930
looks very,
very skinny but still a little.

2971
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:11,210
He's getting more [inaudible],
needs a little thicker now,

2972
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:15,230
put on a little bit more weight.
But when he was a running the 205 miles

2973
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:20,260
when he ran that a big foot,
78 fucking hours run ran 200,

2974
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:21,620
five miles.
I couldn't do that.

2975
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:23,360
Exactly.
That's a discipline thing.

2976
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:25,350
That's the difference between that long
strands.

2977
02:04:31,350 --> 02:04:33,260
People that think they're special and a
guy like him,

2978
02:04:33,261 --> 02:04:36,230
he doesn't think he's special at all.
He thinks the only thing about him that

2979
02:04:36,231 --> 02:04:37,980
separates him from everybody else's,
that he works

2980
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:38,910
harder.
That's it.

2981
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:43,190
But how does one do a hundred mile?
I mean like I don't even.

2982
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:45,870
He's a maniac.
When you start a body break the fuck

2983
02:04:45,871 --> 02:04:47,950
down.
You talked about how he started off like

2984
02:04:47,990 --> 02:04:49,830
doing like 10 ks,
you know,

2985
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:51,120
and then you know,
you feel like,

2986
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:52,530
wow,
maybe I should do a marathon.

2987
02:04:52,531 --> 02:04:55,050
And then he started doing a marathon and
they do a marathon,

2988
02:04:55,051 --> 02:04:56,550
then we'll be,
I want to win a marathon.

2989
02:04:56,551 --> 02:04:58,770
And then you start,
he beat Lance Armstrong in the Boston

2990
02:04:58,771 --> 02:04:59,970
marathon.
Oh my God.

2991
02:04:59,971 --> 02:05:01,260
Yeah.
He's a fucking animal dude.

2992
02:05:01,290 --> 02:05:02,790
You know,
I did a 10 K on accident,

2993
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:07,800
dude.
I went to a,

2994
02:05:07,801 --> 02:05:12,801
I went to Cincinnati
with all your bags off the plane and

2995
02:05:14,761 --> 02:05:16,200
everyone's running and you start running
with them.

2996
02:05:16,201 --> 02:05:20,660
And
I went to,

2997
02:05:20,730 --> 02:05:24,670
I went to Cincinnati for Thanksgiving
and Christmas this year.

2998
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:29,700
It was a couple of years back and I got
there and most of my cousins are pretty

2999
02:05:30,101 --> 02:05:32,860
fit and they're like a,
hey,

3000
02:05:32,861 --> 02:05:35,800
we're doing the um,
just the day with like we're doing the,

3001
02:05:35,801 --> 02:05:39,070
a 10 k tomorrow.
And then we're um,

3002
02:05:39,090 --> 02:05:40,930
you know,
we'll regroup and then we'll come over

3003
02:05:40,931 --> 02:05:42,310
here and then we'll go over to this
aunt's house.

3004
02:05:42,311 --> 02:05:43,600
And I was like,
Oh yeah,

3005
02:05:43,601 --> 02:05:44,434
nick,
do you want to do it?

3006
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:47,220
And I didn't have the,
um,

3007
02:05:47,810 --> 02:05:50,540
like just admit that I didn't know what
attendance list,

3008
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:52,180
so I just said,
yeah,

3009
02:05:54,610 --> 02:05:57,100
I didn't realize what I was doing.
And I was like,

3010
02:05:57,101 --> 02:05:57,934
yeah,
I'll do that.

3011
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:01,930
I showed up with zero point zero
training,

3012
02:06:01,990 --> 02:06:05,920
like nothing and I just go and I was
like,

3013
02:06:05,921 --> 02:06:07,330
how far is this?
And they're like,

3014
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,310
it's about three point one miles.
And I was like,

3015
02:06:09,340 --> 02:06:13,750
Oh shit,
because I'm 250 pounds and I was like,

3016
02:06:13,751 --> 02:06:14,920
this is going to be bad.
Right.

3017
02:06:14,950 --> 02:06:17,470
And I just think is like,
the crowd helps,

3018
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:18,880
you know,
because there's so many people.

3019
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:20,990
There are stretches where there's
nobody.

3020
02:06:21,050 --> 02:06:22,780
Yeah,
there's stretches where there's nobody.

3021
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:23,673
And the thing,
like,

3022
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:26,990
I finished it and I was like,
wow,

3023
02:06:26,991 --> 02:06:27,520
that's,
you know,

3024
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:30,340
I thought I felt like I ran two
marathons,

3025
02:06:30,370 --> 02:06:32,130
you know,
like it was so much further than I've

3026
02:06:32,170 --> 02:06:36,400
run since fucking middle school.
It's like six miles.

3027
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:37,593
I think it was.

3028
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:39,730
Okay.
Oh,

3029
02:06:39,730 --> 02:06:40,720
five case,
three one,

3030
02:06:40,721 --> 02:06:41,760
a 10K six.
Yes,

3031
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:43,760
I did fucking six miles.
And,

3032
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:49,090
and then it was that the next couple
days work the pains.

3033
02:06:49,091 --> 02:06:53,000
I've never like in the hips
and uh,

3034
02:06:53,110 --> 02:06:56,890
we tried to go to a movie like as a
family group and I couldn't sit.

3035
02:06:56,980 --> 02:06:57,611
I was like,
I got,

3036
02:06:57,611 --> 02:07:02,340
I gotta I gotta gladiator because the
pain was just like I couldn't move and

3037
02:07:02,370 --> 02:07:06,130
got to build up to me and full trauma.
It was a shock.

3038
02:07:06,190 --> 02:07:10,600
10 K meaningful trauma in Omaha and uh,
I get,

3039
02:07:10,601 --> 02:07:12,940
I go on,
I'm trying to be healthy and I go on

3040
02:07:12,941 --> 02:07:14,620
radio and I said,
I'm looking for a five k,

3041
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:17,920
five k hit me up,
I'm going to run it this weekend.

3042
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:19,810
And so this guy reaches out to me and
he's like,

3043
02:07:19,811 --> 02:07:21,220
Hey,
I got a brewery five k.

3044
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:22,450
I was like,
right up my alley.

3045
02:07:22,870 --> 02:07:24,560
So I hit a full trial on Friday night
and he goes,

3046
02:07:24,580 --> 02:07:25,930
tomorrow morning we're running a
brewery,

3047
02:07:25,931 --> 02:07:27,820
five k in full.
Like what?

3048
02:07:27,830 --> 02:07:29,440
We run from brewery to brewery.
I go,

3049
02:07:29,441 --> 02:07:30,400
yeah,
you run brewery brewery.

3050
02:07:30,401 --> 02:07:31,800
It's like fucking,
it's like a bar.

3051
02:07:31,810 --> 02:07:33,960
It's like a bar crawl,
but you kill beers the whole time.

3052
02:07:33,961 --> 02:07:35,710
It's perfect.
Have like beers,

3053
02:07:35,711 --> 02:07:36,190
run a five

3054
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:37,390
k go home,
take a nap,

3055
02:07:37,391 --> 02:07:38,890
do two shows,
this will be great.

3056
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:40,510
My favorite part is that he goes,
perfect.

3057
02:07:41,210 --> 02:07:44,340
That sounds ideal to anybody.
Horrible

3058
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:48,670
bull trout.
And I got there and uh,

3059
02:07:48,671 --> 02:07:50,560
and everyone's,
everyone's at the brewery and everyone's

3060
02:07:50,561 --> 02:07:51,610
drinking and we're like,
fuck it.

3061
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:54,830
Let's start killing beers now.
It's like 10 in the morning races at

3062
02:07:54,930 --> 02:07:57,310
like noon.
So we start killing beers.

3063
02:07:57,311 --> 02:07:59,230
We have like five beers and then we're
like,

3064
02:07:59,231 --> 02:08:01,060
all right,
everyone line up and we'd line up.

3065
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:04,090
We noticed that everyone's dressing like
hardcore sports gear and we're not.

3066
02:08:04,091 --> 02:08:05,530
We're like,
God damn it man.

3067
02:08:05,531 --> 02:08:07,090
They're really taking this serious.
And we're like,

3068
02:08:07,091 --> 02:08:08,830
what's the first bar we stopped at?
And they're like,

3069
02:08:08,831 --> 02:08:10,960
no bar.
It's a fucking five k.

3070
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:15,970
and so full tron did.
And I did a five k drunk at like a noon.

3071
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:18,970
And by the way,
we beat half of the fucking field.

3072
02:08:19,190 --> 02:08:21,160
She's drunk.
So the brewery,

3073
02:08:21,630 --> 02:08:22,291
the brewery,
it's,

3074
02:08:22,291 --> 02:08:24,590
that's where it started at the brewery
and it ended at the brewery.

3075
02:08:24,591 --> 02:08:26,890
It was a big circle to the brewery.
Did everybody else drink too?

3076
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:28,960
No one drank except for us.
Everyone's like,

3077
02:08:28,961 --> 02:08:29,880
man,
you really putting them back.

3078
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:31,610
We're like,
well I want to be apart of the team.

3079
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:33,580
Well you were probably fueled up.
I mean that's.

3080
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:36,550
There's a lot of calories in beer and is
also carbohydrates,

3081
02:08:36,551 --> 02:08:40,410
so all the barley and all that jazz
getting when they shoot the gun,

3082
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:43,030
fuel race tells.
Don't people do that?

3083
02:08:43,770 --> 02:08:47,560
Runner known people after running.
Don't they like to drink beer for

3084
02:08:47,561 --> 02:08:50,380
recovery?
Absolutely don't think so.

3085
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:54,610
They used to do it drinking beer for
recovery.

3086
02:08:54,611 --> 02:08:56,650
Post workout.
They used to do it in the,

3087
02:08:56,651 --> 02:08:58,180
in the,
in the Tour de France,

3088
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:01,060
in the Tour de France.
They would stop and drink big heavy

3089
02:09:01,061 --> 02:09:04,750
beers and I would imagine there's like a
lot of calories in that,

3090
02:09:04,751 --> 02:09:05,680
but a lot of calories.

3091
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:08,890
I think it would make you crash a little
bit though.

3092
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:11,770
Like drain you.
I definitely feel like working out when

3093
02:09:11,771 --> 02:09:13,060
I'm drunk.
No.

3094
02:09:13,090 --> 02:09:14,560
Are you serious?
I've done it.

3095
02:09:14,590 --> 02:09:16,250
Wait,
tell us about coke working out.

3096
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:17,900
I forgot about that.
That good.

3097
02:09:18,780 --> 02:09:21,610
Here we go to health benefits.
Here are a few reasons.

3098
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:25,480
So after your run the health benefits of
beer,

3099
02:09:25,830 --> 02:09:27,620
make that a little larger please.
So I can get that.

3100
02:09:27,940 --> 02:09:31,180
Although most runners agree that beer is
not exactly a health food.

3101
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:34,150
There is good news for those of us who
like to imbibe.

3102
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:38,320
Downing a few cold ones as you're
heading out the door for a run is

3103
02:09:38,321 --> 02:09:42,370
obviously not the best choice,
but beer in moderation can be perfectly

3104
02:09:42,371 --> 02:09:45,760
acceptable.
Option for after a run or on non

3105
02:09:45,761 --> 02:09:47,560
training days.
And you go,

3106
02:09:48,850 --> 02:09:49,420
yeah,
I'm.

3107
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:51,190
One of my favorite things doing is on
the road,

3108
02:09:51,191 --> 02:09:53,800
especially when I was working on travel
channel is going right back to the hotel

3109
02:09:53,801 --> 02:09:55,480
after dinner and after drinking and
getting into the,

3110
02:09:55,870 --> 02:09:58,650
into the gym and working out really a
legit.

3111
02:09:58,660 --> 02:10:00,280
I love getting on the treadmill with a
glass.

3112
02:10:00,281 --> 02:10:04,150
I've talked to you about this drunk
feels like to you.

3113
02:10:04,330 --> 02:10:06,820
I said I feel very different than what
it feels like everyone else.

3114
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:09,850
Yeah.
And I had a conversation over the oddly

3115
02:10:09,851 --> 02:10:12,480
enough of the 10 year old yesterday
about being hung over.

3116
02:10:12,850 --> 02:10:15,310
So I guess let me tell you how it's
done.

3117
02:10:15,730 --> 02:10:17,320
He was like,
don't you feel sick?

3118
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:18,820
I.
That's the other problem I have is I

3119
02:10:18,821 --> 02:10:21,070
don't really feel sick when I don't.
After I drank,

3120
02:10:21,071 --> 02:10:23,080
I don't get hung over good drunk by the
way.

3121
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:24,100
I'm.
I'm like,

3122
02:10:24,101 --> 02:10:26,650
I don't think that's the other problem
is no one can ever tell him drunk.

3123
02:10:26,690 --> 02:10:28,350
I remember one time when we were in
Hawaii,

3124
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:33,360
actually I remember specifically that he
had been drinking for like 15

3125
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:39,070
hours and it was so many beers and,
and,

3126
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:43,940
and then liquor and then beers and he's
in our room and I was like,

3127
02:10:43,941 --> 02:10:45,610
dude,
like how are you not,

3128
02:10:45,650 --> 02:10:46,520
you're okay.
He's like,

3129
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:48,350
I'm fucking hammered.
I was like,

3130
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:49,940
but you've looked fine.
He was like,

3131
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,420
Oh,
I definitely not,

3132
02:10:51,650 --> 02:10:54,650
not even close to find right now,
but if he,

3133
02:10:54,710 --> 02:10:57,060
if he didn't tell me that,
I would not know.

3134
02:10:57,210 --> 02:10:59,980
My wife always says I can't.
I cannot tell when you've been drinking,

3135
02:11:00,870 --> 02:11:03,070
but it's every day.
No.

3136
02:11:03,590 --> 02:11:05,030
That's the other thing.
I think there's a lot of,

3137
02:11:05,260 --> 02:11:05,790
you know,
the,

3138
02:11:05,790 --> 02:11:08,900
the,
the pump of what I am.

3139
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:13,400
I think people think one thing I'm not.
How often do you drink booze days?

3140
02:11:13,401 --> 02:11:14,660
A week?
Not right now.

3141
02:11:14,661 --> 02:11:16,220
Not at all,
but uh,

3142
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:18,010
but you say vodka sodas.
Yeah,

3143
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:19,190
but people's,
even if I,

3144
02:11:19,250 --> 02:11:21,590
if I go on stage,
I want to on stage one time affiliate,

3145
02:11:21,591 --> 02:11:24,470
I didn't feel well and I just bought a
soda water on stage and everyone was

3146
02:11:24,471 --> 02:11:25,100
like,
kill it.

3147
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:26,600
And I was like,
there's nothing in it.

3148
02:11:26,690 --> 02:11:27,740
And then they're like,
oh really?

3149
02:11:28,190 --> 02:11:28,671
And you're like,
yeah.

3150
02:11:28,671 --> 02:11:29,061
They're like,
oh,

3151
02:11:29,061 --> 02:11:30,290
we thought you were hammered.
And you're like,

3152
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:31,170
no,
I'm just struggling.

3153
02:11:31,170 --> 02:11:33,080
I don't like going on stage drunk.
Personally,

3154
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:34,940
I don't like being drunk on stage.
I like,

3155
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:37,040
I like standup comedy.
That's what I got into.

3156
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:40,610
But it's also a part of my personality
is everything is a joke.

3157
02:11:40,611 --> 02:11:42,830
I want people to be entertained.
Like this whole weight loss thing.

3158
02:11:42,831 --> 02:11:45,260
Supposed to be fun.
I want people to get a kick out of it.

3159
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:47,930
I,
I could definitely have stopped drinking

3160
02:11:47,931 --> 02:11:49,910
and been a bore and just been like,
oh,

3161
02:11:49,911 --> 02:11:52,100
I think I could.
I could definitely take him.

3162
02:11:52,130 --> 02:11:54,140
But I like the fun of juice going,
fuck it.

3163
02:11:54,141 --> 02:11:57,410
I'm going to the wall.
But how many days a week do you think

3164
02:11:57,411 --> 02:11:58,970
you drink are definitely three.

3165
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:02,960
That just it.
So you drove up saying definitely three.

3166
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:06,020
So you drink less than you don't drink?
No,

3167
02:12:06,021 --> 02:12:07,510
I probably drink more than I don't
drink.

3168
02:12:07,511 --> 02:12:08,700
That's not three.
What?

3169
02:12:09,370 --> 02:12:12,620
This feels like an intervention.
The just curious.

3170
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:16,490
Probably.
I remember when we were the closest of

3171
02:12:16,491 --> 02:12:18,400
friends.
I remember he's

3172
02:12:19,910 --> 02:12:24,170
were a good father and loved seeing you.
Playing with your children.

3173
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:26,153
Let's,
let's,

3174
02:12:27,870 --> 02:12:29,920
let's take a look at this week.
Uh,

3175
02:12:29,940 --> 02:12:32,410
attract New Year's Eve.
But I wanted to,

3176
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:34,490
I only had two drinks and I spent the
night in a hotel.

3177
02:12:34,491 --> 02:12:36,920
I didn't want to drive home because I
thought the roads would be crazy.

3178
02:12:37,210 --> 02:12:39,530
So I received.
Didn't drink yesterday at the rams game.

3179
02:12:39,950 --> 02:12:42,920
Didn't drink today.
I'll drink tomorrow and then I get on a

3180
02:12:42,921 --> 02:12:44,870
plane to New Jersey on the stress
factory.

3181
02:12:44,871 --> 02:12:49,871
I'll drink there.
So maybe maybe I'll drink five of the

3182
02:12:50,781 --> 02:12:52,730
seven nights or four.
Seven,

3183
02:12:52,731 --> 02:12:53,564
nine,
five.

3184
02:12:54,010 --> 02:12:56,780
That's.
But that's an unusual day because you're

3185
02:12:56,810 --> 02:12:59,870
cutting back in order to lose weight.
But if I'm home with the girls,

3186
02:12:59,871 --> 02:13:02,120
I don't know.
There's no reason for me to drink like

3187
02:13:02,130 --> 02:13:04,010
I'm home.
I like a good night's sleep.

3188
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:07,760
I like waking up and being active.
I like going ice skating with them.

3189
02:13:07,761 --> 02:13:09,560
I want to do a podcast,
you know?

3190
02:13:09,561 --> 02:13:11,600
A lot of times people come on my podcast
and be like,

3191
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:13,760
I want to do a shot with the machine.
And you're like,

3192
02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:17,060
I'll never not let them have that.
So of course,

3193
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:21,350
and I count that as a drinking day,
but I'll have one shot but that wouldn't

3194
02:13:21,351 --> 02:13:22,184
affect me.
That doesn't.

3195
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:25,940
I'm to know and I'm different.
So like how often do you think that.

3196
02:13:26,590 --> 02:13:28,280
No different.
No different thing.

3197
02:13:28,281 --> 02:13:29,710
I like,
I'm different than everybody.

3198
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:31,160
Doesn't everyone thinks they're fucking
different?

3199
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,130
I definitely don't.

3200
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:34,550
You don't know by the way.
Hey,

3201
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:35,710
by the way,
let me,

3202
02:13:35,850 --> 02:13:38,580
I hate to be the one to tell you this.
You're the most different human being

3203
02:13:38,581 --> 02:13:41,640
that any of us fucking know.
And there you go and I'm not even

3204
02:13:41,641 --> 02:13:43,140
different.
So there you go.

3205
02:13:43,230 --> 02:13:45,060
Are you going to sit here and let joe
tell us,

3206
02:13:45,510 --> 02:13:47,140
how many podcasts do you do week?
How much?

3207
02:13:47,730 --> 02:13:50,000
How much working out,
how much standard activity.

3208
02:13:50,001 --> 02:13:50,834
Right.
You're amazing.

3209
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:52,890
Everyone says,
how does Rogan do it?

3210
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:54,990
And I just got these different.
You are different than me.

3211
02:13:55,140 --> 02:13:59,100
I do it to keep from going crazy,
but it's my mental problem is that have

3212
02:13:59,101 --> 02:14:01,770
I don't have things to do.
I'm not happy.

3213
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:04,920
Like I don't.
I just figured out a long time ago in

3214
02:14:04,921 --> 02:14:06,330
order to.
For me to be happy,

3215
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:11,690
I have to be exhausted in busy.
I have to be burnt out from working out,

3216
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:16,710
like not burnt out,
but I have to even myself out and I have

3217
02:14:16,711 --> 02:14:17,850
to have puzzles.

3218
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:19,830
I've done things to solve.
That's a good thing.

3219
02:14:19,831 --> 02:14:22,830
I think being busy makes definitely me
feel better.

3220
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:27,980
You feel like you're getting the worst
feeling is I'm feeling like a lazy bitch

3221
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:31,380
ain't doing shit.
Your level two honestly though.

3222
02:14:31,770 --> 02:14:33,750
And he's right among.
Got It is.

3223
02:14:33,751 --> 02:14:38,070
It does seem off off the charts like to
do like three,

3224
02:14:38,970 --> 02:14:40,920
three,
three hour podcast.

3225
02:14:41,010 --> 02:14:43,650
Do Jujitsu.
Do Your bowhunting.

3226
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:49,040
Do fucking Pool B with your favorite
store credit material at the store?

3227
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:50,670
Yeah.
I don't think I've seen you repeat

3228
02:14:50,730 --> 02:14:53,220
anything at the store in the fucking
past month.

3229
02:14:53,221 --> 02:14:57,270
I've been there like it's off the charts
because I just did a special,

3230
02:14:57,570 --> 02:14:59,130
you know,
once I released a special.

3231
02:14:59,190 --> 02:14:59,701
Yeah,
me too.

3232
02:14:59,701 --> 02:15:02,820
I'm still doing the same shit.
You got to chip away at new stuff and

3233
02:15:02,821 --> 02:15:05,460
people get mad at you,
but I'm still in the new stuff.

3234
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:06,720
I'm working on new stuff.

3235
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:09,830
I've seen the brand new stuff every
fucking time you aren't.

3236
02:15:09,831 --> 02:15:10,664
Look,
I

3237
02:15:12,810 --> 02:15:14,250
got it right.
I don't really like discipline.

3238
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:15,450
Oh,
I do too.

3239
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:18,510
I wrote the other way too.
I feel like you have to write like that.

3240
02:15:18,511 --> 02:15:20,850
I think a lot of people,
I mean I don't tell people what to do

3241
02:15:20,851 --> 02:15:22,560
because a lot of people don't like to
write this way,

3242
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:26,940
but I feel like this sitting out in
front of a fucking computer with nothing

3243
02:15:26,941 --> 02:15:31,800
but writing in my mind it,
it enhances my ability to write on stage

3244
02:15:32,010 --> 02:15:37,010
and it gives me tools that I can use to
ad Lib and do it the other way as well.

3245
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:39,390
I think that's true because there's a
thing that people say,

3246
02:15:39,391 --> 02:15:40,310
oh,
I write on stage.

3247
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:41,280
Well,
I do too.

3248
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:42,930
I do too.
Everybody does.

3249
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:46,380
A lot of people write on stage,
but I think you should right in front of

3250
02:15:46,381 --> 02:15:49,260
a fucking notebook to have a hard time
with that.

3251
02:15:49,380 --> 02:15:50,550
Everybody does.
I do too.

3252
02:15:50,970 --> 02:15:51,600
No,
but I mean like,

3253
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:54,100
I mean it doesn't.
It doesn't inspire me creatively to sit.

3254
02:15:54,490 --> 02:15:57,120
It's because you got to do it.
It's like a discipline.

3255
02:15:57,180 --> 02:15:57,830
No,
I've done it.

3256
02:15:57,830 --> 02:15:59,190
I've,
I've definitely done it.

3257
02:15:59,191 --> 02:16:02,230
It just does like for me,
if I'm being dead serious,

3258
02:16:02,231 --> 02:16:04,890
if I take a walk,
my brain will start working and that's

3259
02:16:04,891 --> 02:16:07,650
fine too.
As long as you dedicate specific time to

3260
02:16:07,651 --> 02:16:09,630
writing.
I mean if it's just like a walking thing

3261
02:16:09,631 --> 02:16:12,500
and then you talk into a microphone,
that to me is it's,

3262
02:16:12,530 --> 02:16:13,560
you know,
you can call it writing.

3263
02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:15,270
Like if I'm sitting in front of a
computer,

3264
02:16:15,271 --> 02:16:19,440
I'm writing in air quotes,
but if you're walking and you talk to

3265
02:16:19,441 --> 02:16:21,240
your phone,
you have an idea and you record it.

3266
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:24,720
That's writing to just creativity.
I do that,

3267
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:28,680
but you have to have my,
my thinking is the more time you spend

3268
02:16:28,681 --> 02:16:32,320
forcing yourself to like right now is
that the desperate times because my

3269
02:16:32,321 --> 02:16:35,470
specialist just released and I'm doing,
you know,

3270
02:16:35,530 --> 02:16:37,750
uh,
did new years and I'm doing these big

3271
02:16:37,751 --> 02:16:42,190
shows and I'm doing an hour and I got a
new fucking shit and some of it is

3272
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:43,990
unlike colt legs.

3273
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:48,280
Some of my new materials look
like some of it's alive,

3274
02:16:48,310 --> 02:16:51,580
some of it's killing,
some of it's like new stuff that's doing

3275
02:16:51,581 --> 02:16:54,390
really well and other stuff is like,
every time I do it was like,

3276
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:57,160
is it going to work tonight,
am I going to find a new way to do it,

3277
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:59,530
am I going to.
And then sometimes out of nowhere I'm

3278
02:16:59,531 --> 02:17:01,450
just taking a chance and I'm going the
wrong way.

3279
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:03,980
I take a chance and I start talking to,
I'll,

3280
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,820
I'll do the punchline first or I'll do
this part.

3281
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:07,450
You know,
the,

3282
02:17:07,450 --> 02:17:09,850
the,
the strongest part of it leading into

3283
02:17:09,851 --> 02:17:11,710
the weakest part of it.
Like for no reason,

3284
02:17:11,711 --> 02:17:14,100
I just,
I just take this crazy chance to try it

3285
02:17:14,110 --> 02:17:16,340
and I know while I'm doing it I'm like,
fuck yeah,

3286
02:17:16,460 --> 02:17:19,210
going can dig yourself out of this hole.
But that's what gets you through it.

3287
02:17:19,450 --> 02:17:20,740
Well,
the only thing that gets you through it

3288
02:17:20,741 --> 02:17:24,400
as like a lot of sense,
you've just got to keep hammering sets

3289
02:17:24,550 --> 02:17:26,860
and then every mistake you make from
that,

3290
02:17:26,861 --> 02:17:31,861
you applied to the next set and then six
months down the line you have a real

3291
02:17:32,021 --> 02:17:33,630
hour that you could put in a special.
No wait,

3292
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:36,070
let's talk about that real quickly
because a,

3293
02:17:36,580 --> 02:17:37,413
I agree with you.
I think.

3294
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:39,220
I think you got to be on stage and be
doing it.

3295
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:40,780
Like that's why I love weekends,
uh,

3296
02:17:40,781 --> 02:17:43,840
clubs because you got six sets in there,
the best and you're like,

3297
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:45,400
I got it.
I've said that to my,

3298
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:47,020
my manager recently.
I'm like,

3299
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:48,160
what I want to do?
Like they're like,

3300
02:17:48,161 --> 02:17:50,620
they want to book me because I can sell
off these big ass places.

3301
02:17:50,621 --> 02:17:52,300
Now I'm like,
I want to do clubs,

3302
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:53,320
I want to do more clubs.

3303
02:17:53,530 --> 02:17:53,820
Like,
right.

3304
02:17:53,820 --> 02:17:55,780
Especially right.
Right now I'm going to do four shows in

3305
02:17:55,781 --> 02:17:56,920
a weekend.
You know,

3306
02:17:56,921 --> 02:17:59,380
I want to do shows.
That's the way to do it,

3307
02:17:59,381 --> 02:18:01,810
man.
Those four shows in a 200 seat room.

3308
02:18:02,070 --> 02:18:05,080
That's where it's at.
But let's talk timeline with both of you

3309
02:18:05,081 --> 02:18:08,440
guys because I think you've done what,
three hours now?

3310
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:13,060
I've recorded four,
so I'm working on my fifth.

3311
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:16,620
But do you think six months is too quick
to turn around an hour or for

3312
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:17,800
production?
Yes.

3313
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:18,251
No,
no,

3314
02:18:18,251 --> 02:18:21,880
I meant I meant meaning for you.
Writing was because like right now I

3315
02:18:21,881 --> 02:18:23,230
have a new hour,
but I go.

3316
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:25,510
I don't know.
I feel like I want it to breathe.

3317
02:18:25,511 --> 02:18:28,730
I want it eight months and see how it
is.

3318
02:18:28,760 --> 02:18:31,060
That's what I let it grow because I
don't know what you guys do on

3319
02:18:31,061 --> 02:18:32,940
Wednesday.
You guys around on Wednesday have

3320
02:18:32,941 --> 02:18:33,850
flooded in New Jersey.

3321
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,610
What are you doing?
I'm going to do the ice house if you're

3322
02:18:36,611 --> 02:18:37,444
around.
Yeah.

3323
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:39,250
What is it?
10 Wednesday you,

3324
02:18:39,251 --> 02:18:40,630
me and Ron White.
Holla.

3325
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:42,910
Holla at your boy.
Oh Shit.

3326
02:18:43,150 --> 02:18:43,871
Bitches.
Fuck.

3327
02:18:43,871 --> 02:18:46,150
I'll see you guys.
Stress factory fact.

3328
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:48,200
Kansas City this weekend.
Oh,

3329
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:51,160
when do you leave?
Thursday I'm doing helium.

3330
02:18:51,610 --> 02:18:52,600
No,
Kansas City.

3331
02:18:52,970 --> 02:18:54,580
That's in St Louis.
I thought they have an alien.

3332
02:18:54,620 --> 02:18:56,410
Begins during the Improv.
Improv.

3333
02:18:56,950 --> 02:18:57,970
Improv,
Kansas City.

3334
02:18:58,270 --> 02:19:01,850
I'm doing the Wilbur January 21st.
So if you'd like to come see me in a

3335
02:19:01,851 --> 02:19:04,300
theater,
which is very seldom I don't.

3336
02:19:04,301 --> 02:19:07,210
I'm not a big theater guy because I
don't think my act translate archway to

3337
02:19:07,211 --> 02:19:07,930
sell tickets.
Burt,

3338
02:19:07,930 --> 02:19:10,360
will the Wilbur's the best theater ever.
That's what everyone says.

3339
02:19:10,361 --> 02:19:11,820
Super Shallow.
Oh really?

3340
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:14,290
There's three stacks.
It's like having three comedy clubs

3341
02:19:14,291 --> 02:19:16,570
stacked on top of each other.
It's amazing.

3342
02:19:16,830 --> 02:19:19,840
The Wilbur in Boston is fucking amazing.
Go get tickets guys.

3343
02:19:19,841 --> 02:19:20,590
January 21st.

3344
02:19:20,590 --> 02:19:21,880
I'll be there.
That's a good spot.

3345
02:19:22,290 --> 02:19:23,740
All right,
let's wrap this bitch up.

3346
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:25,360
Um,
so tomorrow,

3347
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:27,920
11:00 in the morning,
going to find out.

3348
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:30,710
Is it going to be the water champ or is
it going to be the machine?

3349
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:34,790
The machinist machinist.
So tune in tomorrow.

3350
02:19:34,791 --> 02:19:38,450
Hashtag who is fat week?
Do we take the beer right away?

3351
02:19:38,510 --> 02:19:39,800
Oh fuck you.
Starting it off.

3352
02:19:39,801 --> 02:19:40,790
And then we party.
Well,

3353
02:19:40,791 --> 02:19:44,810
I'm going to bring in if I purchased a
electric shaver,

3354
02:19:44,930 --> 02:19:47,280
so I'm bringing a brand new electric
shaver.

3355
02:19:47,281 --> 02:19:49,180
We'll pop it out so nobody has to worry
about aids.

3356
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:50,240
Like trimmers.
Yeah,

3357
02:19:50,950 --> 02:19:52,030
put the clipper thing.
I

3358
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:55,250
ordered.
I ordered a barber's Cape,

3359
02:19:55,310 --> 02:19:55,971
so.
Oh,

3360
02:19:55,971 --> 02:19:58,070
beautiful.
Do you have a sponsorship for Dollar

3361
02:19:58,070 --> 02:20:00,570
Shave Club?
Dollar Shave Club's my sponsor.

3362
02:20:00,571 --> 02:20:03,410
It's on sponsors the podcast,
but we'll give them a free one.

3363
02:20:03,620 --> 02:20:07,660
I've always wanted to use their razors.
I fucking Greg and going to the race,

3364
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:12,680
right.
Submitted stuff called Dr. Carver's easy

3365
02:20:12,681 --> 02:20:14,390
shave butter.
Have you ever used that to?

3366
02:20:14,430 --> 02:20:16,160
I've never obviously had been 12 years.
Oh,

3367
02:20:16,161 --> 02:20:16,994
that's right.
You haven't.

3368
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,130
What about your balls?
No.

3369
02:20:18,180 --> 02:20:19,280
Uh,
you know what?

3370
02:20:19,490 --> 02:20:21,260
I got so fat.
It was a lot of guesswork.

3371
02:20:21,261 --> 02:20:24,170
So I stopped.
And on that note,

3372
02:20:24,171 --> 02:20:27,380
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Tomorrow 11 am Pacific.

3373
02:20:27,381 --> 02:20:28,370
We will see you.
Bye.

3374
02:20:28,371 --> 02:20:28,960
Love you.

3375
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:33,070
One
of the best podcasts I've ever been.
