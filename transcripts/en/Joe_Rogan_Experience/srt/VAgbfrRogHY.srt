1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,920
Oh Shit,
we go back from our entry hall,

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,140
from another country.
What up man?

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,770
What's up,
brother?

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,110
Good to see you,
man.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,610
Yeah,
man

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,900
was in Montreal comedy festival.
Uh,

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,810
first of all,
Canada is right there.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,140
Yeah.
But it's such a hard country to get 

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,140
into.
It's very hard to get into.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,140
It's crazy.
Yeah.

11
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:33,200
They don't want any douche bags.
They have a zero douche bag policy.

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,880
But.
But listen,

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,270
I saw the ex mayor of Montreal right in 
walking down sunset in front of the 

14
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:45,110
comedy store.
The one that was on crack,

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,170
right?
Is that the Toronto Gang?

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,670
The Toronto Board.
You saw that guy or that guy?

17
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,730
One day walking by the comedy store and 
everybody took pictures with him and he 

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,210
was the mayor and he did crack.
There's a tape of it.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,910
Right.
So how the fuck did he get here?

20
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,660
But Canada won't even take a drunk 
driver from us.

21
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,090
That's true.
Well,

22
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:10,240
I think I'm crack you probably better 
driver when you're on crack.

23
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,570
He just more expeditious he get things 
done.

24
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,160
Yeah.
That's a

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,970
like if you,
if you commit a crime,

26
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:19,160
you can't get into Canada.
If you have a Dui,

27
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:23,390
like Patrice had a dui on,
he had,

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,420
well not patrice,
but I know people that have duis that 

29
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,420
can get into Canada.
Oh yeah.

30
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,510
Super Common.
Like work on it.

31
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,530
You can't work there.
You can't get in there and can't get up 

32
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:35,530
there.
Sagan,

33
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:35,540
jts.
He can't get up there and get up there.

34
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,420
But he's got like some real shit.
Right?

35
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:39,820
He's got some real shit.
Armed kidnapping.

36
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:43,190
But that's why I say Dui because even 
though Dui is a serious,

37
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:48,191
the ones where you get convicted but you
do your probation period and you,

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,490
you know,
you,

39
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,240
you get your license back,
you even when you get your license back,

40
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:58,241
you can't get into Canada.
But somebody who was the mayor and sold 

41
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:03,071
crack and I know other Canadians that 
probably committed crimes can be in 

42
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:03,071
here.

43
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,630
Like why the fuck is this so tough for 
me to get into Canada?

44
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:10,490
And when I got to the airport they uh,
I've been to Canada before.

45
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,660
So when I got to the airport they have 
to try to fill out some immigration form

46
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,560
and it's three hours.
It was like two and a half hours early.

47
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:23,561
Thank God.
Then they want me to fill out this form 

48
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,170
on my phone online.
It's like 40 something questions like 

49
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,830
online is the new way to do it.
This a new way to do it?

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Well again,
I got a British passport so everybody 

51
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,790
that was just had a straight American 
passport went in.

52
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,290
How does that work?
You have like a Jamaican passport.

53
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,320
Is that what it is now?
I've got a British one because I was 

54
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,320
from England.
From England.

55
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,500
Yeah.
And so now when you're in a America from

56
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,110
England,
like how does it work?

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,290
They give you like a have a green card 
so you're not a full American citizen.

58
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,110
Like a permanent place.
Certain Shit with you.

59
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,170
Why not?
Because it didn't like treasonous 

60
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,960
careful.
I gotta be careful you from another 

61
00:02:59,960 --> 00:02:59,960
land,
another nation.

62
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,160
Robert,
I'm here.

63
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,280
It's not odd.
I mean that's really odd.

64
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,170
Like here,
here's a perfect example.

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,520
Perfect example.
I didn't know that you were born in.

66
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,320
If you told me I forgot,
right.

67
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,710
He probably forgot.
I probably will forget.

68
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,040
We forget about each other.
We'll especially that kind of fact is it

69
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,170
doesn't mean anything doesn't mean 
anything,

70
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,440
but like automatically,
like in the grand scheme of things I'm 

71
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,540
supposed to look at you like,
Oh,

72
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,980
you're on the other team here.

73
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,570
You can be one of those embedded people 
I just read about these Russians,

74
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,380
Russians in New Jersey.
Did you hear about this anymore?

75
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,350
Do you not trusting English people 
either anymore.

76
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,210
The Russians were in a,
uh,

77
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:44,211
wanna say Montclair,
like a nice area of New Jersey and uh,

78
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,110
they were uh,
a regular family.

79
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:48,180
This,
the Russian fan,

80
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:51,310
but there weren't really this regular 
family.

81
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:54,040
They were actually embedded Soviet 
spies.

82
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,150
Well,
that sounds like the American.

83
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,060
Look at that shit.
Russian spies,

84
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,580
New Jersey home heading for sale.
Damn,

85
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:03,010
don't buy that house.
What the fuck?

86
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,070
I want somebody to watch you.
Fuck with my money and shit in there.

87
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:09,610
There's gonna be cameras that watch the 
shit come out of your asshole.

88
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,830
It was probably cameras everywhere.
They would watch the shit.

89
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:14,770
Come on,
man.

90
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,400
You can't get a Russian house from some 
Russian spies.

91
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,260
You gotta be like a crazy person.

92
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,210
You might find some hidden spaces with 
money I shouldn't have made me feel like

93
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:27,190
a total failure.
What does he said?

94
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:32,191
He said that he doesn't expect the 
Russian spy connection to help or hurt 

95
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:32,830
the sale.
Bitch,

96
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,430
you're out of your fucking mind.
I mean,

97
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,480
that's not the worst thing that can 
happen to a house.

98
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:40,830
It's just a bunch of spies.
Nobody's.

99
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,820
Hopefully nobody was murdered in the 
house,

100
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,620
but when someone's murdered in the 
house,

101
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,510
good luck selling that house.
You can get the PR,

102
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,530
you get price down,
you're better off just burning to the 

103
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,101
ground,
smash in that thing and then rebuilding 

104
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:58,801
a new house and even then people don't 
want to live there because that's where 

105
00:04:58,801 --> 00:04:58,801
the old house where the dude got killed.
Used to be.

106
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,460
Let me ask you about how old is your 
house?

107
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,950
It's a brand new person in there.

108
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,400
No,
no,

109
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:04,900
no.
I think it was made in the seventies,

110
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:09,901
Seventies.
Do you know if anybody was murdered or 

111
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:09,901
died?
There?

112
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:13,590
A.
I've never seen a ghost so I have to 

113
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,310
inform you,
but there's a moratorium.

114
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,750
What's that website?
You can look it up.

115
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,780
I just heard about it.
I'm not sure that that was going to ask 

116
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:21,780
you if you heard,
if you knew about it,

117
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,660
a website where you find out somebody 
died in your house when it was.

118
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,630
He had like a.
do you remember that?

119
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,820
That this one always got to me,
man,

120
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,740
that um,
those brothers that shot their commands,

121
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,250
Mendez brothers.
So one of them had a wig on remembering 

122
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:38,410
it.
This glorious fake head of hair.

123
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,480
They may take it off when he went to 
jail.

124
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,830
It was really crazy story because they 
shotgunned their own parents.

125
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,390
Whoa,
man.

126
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:51,391
How the fuck does that happen to the one
on the left to one of them has a total 

127
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,480
wig.
I mean,

128
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,270
you,
you look at it,

129
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,370
you go,
oh,

130
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:55,060
I get it.
Now.

131
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:57,980
The one on the right was just blessed.
Just straight

132
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,690
up.
Blessed with curly locks.

133
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,580
So various.
What the fuck man.

134
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,180
Those,
those,

135
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,120
those sons shotgun.
They're fucking parents,

136
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:10,121
man.
Do you know Kirk Fox used to teach them 

137
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:10,121
tennis?
Oh,

138
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:12,320
that's right.
That's right.

139
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,680
I do.
Somehow vaguely remember that he has a 

140
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,540
whole story about teaching them tear 
tennis to.

141
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,340
That scares the shit out of me that 
people could do.

142
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:27,341
That doesn't scare the shit out of me 
nearly as much as people can get so 

143
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:27,860
angry at someone that they could shoot 
them,

144
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,400
but it scares the shit out of me that 
someone could do that to their dad and 

145
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,870
their mom to written.
They shoot the mom to Jesus.

146
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,500
We're adopted,
right?

147
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,760
Where they.
Yeah,

148
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,560
I think the Menendez brothers were 
adopted.

149
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,800
Oh yeah.
And I think.

150
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,900
I think they're just trying to get 
money.

151
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,280
Oh,
what is that?

152
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,520
Sexual and psychological abuse that had 
suffered at the hands of their parents.

153
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:49,940
Oh,
well,

154
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,830
there you go.
I know.

155
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,950
It's like you always want immediately 
blamed it on the kids.

156
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,590
Right?
Because they killed their parents,

157
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:00,230
but the parents could have been fucking 
monsters.

158
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,220
Yeah.
You never know.

159
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:01,790
Oh,
well,

160
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,680
it's got.
They have to be monsters.

161
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,090
I mean,
if you think about it,

162
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,270
how do you make a kid that is capable of
shooting you in your sleep?

163
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,180
You gotta be you gotTa.
Raise that kid horribly.

164
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,690
Unless you just by dumb luck,
have to complete genetic psychopath from

165
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:19,550
birth that you could have done nothing 
to fix.

166
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,880
You've got two guys that are willing to 
shoot you while you're sleeping and you 

167
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,370
raise them from the time they were 
babies.

168
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,090
That's crazy.
Anyway,

169
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:31,460
I was going to say their house.
Yeah.

170
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:34,010
I wondered what happened to their house.
Burnt that fucking thing to the ground.

171
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,010
Probably.
I wonder what happened to it.

172
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Like Nicole Simpson's house still there 
for somebody lived there.

173
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,930
Wasn't Nicole Simpson's?
Was that a house or was that outside of 

174
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:46,930
my apartment building or Condo?
Yeah.

175
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,230
Damn man,
that's a weird one because that's like,

176
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:53,120
it's a public building.
You got to just deal with it.

177
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,190
People just deal with it.
Is that apartment like still empty hers 

178
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,160
that he killed them on the street.
He killed them outside,

179
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:06,161
but every time you go home you have to 
step over a crime scene to walk into 

180
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:10,470
your house and you've seen the pictures.
Yeah.

181
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,550
You know the history.
Every time Oj documentary comes out or 

182
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,781
every time they have an Oj series on tv 
or when his a parole hearing comes up,

183
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,040
you're like,
but a doorway into the house.

184
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,680
So I wonder if like I want to talk to 
the person who's like,

185
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,880
doesn't give a fuck and listen that 
motherfucker,

186
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,700
you know what I'm saying?

187
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,570
Like a deal's a deal.
Baby Sprint would listen.

188
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,850
She should have been nicer dorm.
Did you ever see the autopsy photos?

189
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,740
Uh,
did.

190
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:51,680
I don't know if you haven't,
don't.

191
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,060
It's not worth it.
You get it.

192
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:58,150
I saw the murder scene photos.
It's just so hard to believe that 

193
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:01,200
someone could do that to someone that 
was pretty scared about it.

194
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:06,201
They had babies with just people get 
crazy game of thrones out here,

195
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,260
but just rarely.
That's what it is.

196
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,340
It's like every week it's the game of 
thrones normal on the game of thrones,

197
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:16,410
which I just started watching in the.
Yeah,

198
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,760
I didn't know what the fuck was going 
on,

199
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,500
man.
I started watching this new season.

200
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:20,940
I was like,
I forgot everything.

201
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:22,860
I've started watching it like a few 
months ago.

202
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,390
I started watching it over from the 
beginning,

203
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,370
every that's what you should do,
watch it from season one and you see how

204
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:34,371
much stuff you didn't know or didn't 
understand or didn't realize and 

205
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:35,190
[inaudible] game of thrones,
they don't give a fuck.

206
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:40,430
Like they'll introduce a new character 
and having talking to a regular 

207
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,370
character like they'd been talking for 
awhile and you're like,

208
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,200
did I miss something?
Exactly.

209
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,360
But then if you go back,
you know,

210
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:47,010
now that guy is new,
I'm not supposed to know them and you've

211
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:52,011
got homework,
you've got to do research to understand 

212
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:52,011
that show.
Well this,

213
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:55,791
these kinds of shows have kind of 
stopped my interest in movies like 

214
00:09:55,791 --> 00:10:00,270
movies are okay,
but a movie is 90 minutes or two hours.

215
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,820
It's over.
When it's over know I'm done,

216
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,760
but these goddamn things get you in 
faster.

217
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,260
Like I'm not like,
what is this?

218
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,280
A nerd HPO hacked upcoming episodes,
game of thrones data leaked online poll.

219
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,190
What you look at it.
So the results like the scripts that 

220
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,050
they mean by data shows.
Oh No,

221
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,350
actual.
Oh No.

222
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,470
Some other shows got taken to.

223
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,450
Oh yeah,
they should just edit offline.

224
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,520
Oh my goodness.
Monsters.

225
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,190
Monsters.
How dare you.

226
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,250
Careful.
Yeah,

227
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,640
some Wizkid,
right?

228
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:40,140
Probably from China,
something like that.

229
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,450
So yeah,
we can't compete anymore.

230
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,230
Russia kicking everybody out of Russia 
hear about that shit.

231
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,280
They are all the people that are working
at the embassy.

232
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,860
70 five American delegates or whatever 
they would be called.

233
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,450
I'm sure they are happy to go home.
Yeah,

234
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,380
like Russia out of here.
Unless they got something going on.

235
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Yeah.
Got some crazy fake Russian life over 

236
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:03,630
there.
Just like the people in Montclair.

237
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,230
Seven hundred 55,
755 diplomats.

238
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,990
What does that mean?
We're going to war with Russia.

239
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,730
No,
come on man.

240
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:13,390
They've got mom in Montclair,
right?

241
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:15,840
They've got a house.
People just live in there.

242
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,400
What happened to those people in that 
house?

243
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,140
Did they kick them out and put them in 
jail?

244
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I think they put them in jail.
Go back to that story like how did they 

245
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,570
find out they were spies?
That's a good question,

246
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:26,170
man.
That's a real good question.

247
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,860
Just went to the house sale like,
well,

248
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,330
give me some.
Give me some explanation here.

249
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,340
Yo.
It says their story partially inspired 

250
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,701
the fx drama,
the Americans to undercover Russian 

251
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:38,280
spies living in the U.
s with two young children.

252
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,370
That's a fucking amazing show,
isn't really the Americans is so fucking

253
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:44,250
amazing.
Really?

254
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,700
Yeah,
man.

255
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:49,701
What's it on front of the Vladimir in 
Lydia.

256
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,220
How do you say that name?
Gerta.

257
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,740
You have

258
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,120
led the merely in Lydia and lived in the
home in Montclair.

259
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,430
Under the name of Richard and Cynthia 
Murphy.

260
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,540
Hi,
we're Richmond.

261
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,700
Cynthia Murphy.
Hi.

262
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:09,030
I wondered what,
what they talked like before they 

263
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,771
arrested in 2010 along with eight other 
spies accused of leading double lives,

264
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:13,900
complete with false passports,
secret code words,

265
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,730
fake names,
invisible ink and encrypted rate.

266
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,420
Invisible ink.
Dude.

267
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,540
What kind of weird ass life is that?
It's weird to think that there's someone

268
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:27,541
that could be a spy in your neighborhood
and that he thinks that you're the enemy

269
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,260
because you were born over here and he 
was born over there.

270
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,830
You know,
just like what we were talking about 

271
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,241
with you having a passport from England,
but what's in Jersey that they live in 

272
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:41,830
Jersey and doing this shit like who are 
they?

273
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:43,090
Close to?
Well,

274
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:44,530
Jersey,
close to New York,

275
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,800
first of all,
and there's a lot of very wealthy people

276
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:48,970
that live in Montclair.

277
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,850
I believe.
Montclair's a very nice area.

278
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,510
Google that should be.
My uncle used to have a pottery studio,

279
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,080
a pottery studio in the Montclair.
That is,

280
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:05,290
that is some rich white shit.
Well it was more like a hippie artist 

281
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:10,191
stuff.
He's an art teacher who used to teach 

282
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:10,191
art in,
uh,

283
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:10,210
in,
in school.

284
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:12,340
I don't think it was.
I think highschool.

285
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,920
What's up?
How do I look that up?

286
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:19,630
Like Montclair New Jersey.
Um,

287
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,920
what's that word?
They use?

288
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,060
Medium income.
Yeah,

289
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,690
look up that.
I think it's a baller place.

290
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,750
I think it's like Beverly Hills.
It's like the Beverly Hills of New 

291
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:30,750
Jersey.
Maybe I'm exaggerating.

292
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,920
Hundred Sixty,
3000.

293
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,560
That's a lot of money for the,
the average,

294
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,850
that probably means that most people the
ratio and perhaps.

295
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,020
Yeah,
there's probably a lot of rich this one.

296
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,300
Poor rich person that brought that price
down.

297
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,520
It's maybe.
Why do you think they do it?

298
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:45,980
Okay,
let's,

299
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:48,220
let's take a guess.
Do you think they sneak in?

300
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:51,820
They become spies.
They get tight with rich people and then

301
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,880
you know like look,
I know a family that had ted fucking 

302
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,871
cruise over their house for some event 
that we're holding like a year or so 

303
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,630
before the election,
maybe two years before the election.

304
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,070
Like these people were so baller.
They had ted Cruz give like one of those

305
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:12,730
stupid stump speeches in their house 
for,

306
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,640
for money is raised to raise money to 
raise money.

307
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:20,641
They're like big pro Israel supporters 
that Ted Cruz in their house talking 

308
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:22,030
about Israel.
Very trippy shit.

309
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,670
Like very trippy shit.
Like you're,

310
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,920
you're literally hanging out in your 
house with a guy that might be running 

311
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:31,170
the nukes,
right?

312
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,200
Yeah.
Like,

313
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:35,800
so if you're a Russian spy and you can 
get tight with that dude,

314
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,870
you can hang out with that dude.
Hey Frank is a tanker.

315
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,300
Was really coming over with.
I'll tell you what,

316
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,560
it makes a lot of sense.
There's a lot of his policies that are 

317
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,821
real.
I'm really agreeing when you just call 

318
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:49,441
up the Russian embassy,
send me some money so I can throw in a 

319
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:52,100
and get close at that cruise and you 
just bring in a truckload of Vietnamese

320
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,360
hookers.
Just out

321
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,170
Ted.
All fucked up on that same method.

322
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Rob Ford had solar can just get the 
party role and start filming.

323
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,700
We need to know.
Start having a black male info on Ted 

324
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:10,700
Cruz.
We need to know.

325
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,301
We can count on you.
Everybody keeps getting fired from the 

326
00:15:15,301 --> 00:15:15,301
White House.
Does anybody understand what the fuck is

327
00:15:15,301 --> 00:15:17,320
going on over there?
It was anybody fired today.

328
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:21,720
Yet there's a meme that Scaramucci guy,
however you say his name.

329
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Um,
there's a meme of him where he's gone 

330
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,140
like that,
like with his mouth.

331
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,280
I'm like,
oh.

332
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,310
And it said,
um,

333
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,070
if you take,
if you get this job,

334
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:35,580
where do you see yourself in 10 days?
Hilarious.

335
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:37,220
That's funny.
That's like,

336
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,280
like how do,
how do you hire a guy who clearly looks 

337
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,670
like he's done coke?
Does he?

338
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,800
He looks like a wolf of Wall Street.
It looks like a wolf of Wall Street 

339
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:48,800
here.

340
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Right?
This is.

341
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,510
This is the guy just on looks alone.
Like this.

342
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:53,440
Cocky.
He's a,

343
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,940
he's a hedge fund.
Jarque,

344
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,350
you know,
he follows everybody online.

345
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,290
He probably follows you.
Hilarious follows me.

346
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,430
He does.
Yep.

347
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,390
Yeah,
that makes sense.

348
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,530
I think he follows.
Everybody got $150,000.

349
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,160
Did you ever have him on the show?
Of course.

350
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,580
That's a great guess.
I would love to talk to one of those 

351
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:13,580
dudes are.
Find out what it's like in there.

352
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,190
Especially the guys in there for like 10
days.

353
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,120
This guy.
We'll talk.

354
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,180
Well,
I have had a hedge fund guy I know that 

355
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,180
Peter Schiff guy on before that 
financial wizard.

356
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,410
He's coming on again.
He's an interesting cat.

357
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,440
He's a big time Wall Street guy.
I mean he's got some gigantic firm than 

358
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:29,280
employees who knows how many fucking 
people.

359
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,550
But he's uh,
he's also always on television.

360
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,580
Breaking down what's wrong with like 
financial bubbles at the real estate 

361
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:37,580
bubble?

362
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,370
He,
he called all that shit.

363
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:43,371
The subprime mortgage bubble.
He called all that shit years ago after 

364
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:46,161
I'm calling.
I'm calling the Netflix bubble right 

365
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:46,161
now.
Uhm,

366
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:47,130
up to hear you.
I'm calling.

367
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,520
It cannot be the only one in itself.
You're not the only one by the cool.

368
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,670
You know there was an article that was 
out just yesterday about debt.

369
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,800
There was something about Netflix when 
in debt,

370
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:01,210
something like does think it was said it
was good times did an investigation and 

371
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,020
it was just like they found out their 
$20,000,000,000

372
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,740
in debt.
How's that possible?

373
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,730
Because they're spending so much money 
on these shows man and promoting them 

374
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:10,730
and it's like,
listen,

375
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,221
they just celebrated a few months ago.
The $100 million a customer like 

376
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:21,830
whatever they called it $100 million.
So that means that facebook will be 

377
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,590
laughing because facebook's got how many
subscribers.

378
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,970
Right?
But there's a big difference.

379
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,920
Facebook doesn't get $9 a month from 
you,

380
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:34,310
but each one of those,
100 million people are giving $9 a 

381
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,310
month.
That's $900.

382
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,290
Million dollars a month.
That's not good.

383
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,980
That's,
that's almost a billion dollars a month.

384
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:39,780
That's $12,000,000,000
a year,

385
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,390
maybe 10,
$10,000,000,000

386
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:44,880
a year.
It's an insane amount of money.

387
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,350
You know what it is,
what it is,

388
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:49,000
what it is.
Human man,

389
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,110
man is so valuable.
Right?

390
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,880
I know even when something can work,
like they make systems at work,

391
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,240
but the problem with those systems is 
that humans run those systems and they 

392
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:08,270
are so valuable that they fuck shit up.
Is that the right way to say that word 

393
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,350
valuable?
Probably not.

394
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,840
Sounds perfect though,
but yeah,

395
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,180
it sounds good.
Don't look it up.

396
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:15,030
People.
I always thought it was valuable because

397
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,080
it must be British.
Jamaican accent makes sing things sounds

398
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:25,701
different,
but there's always those words that you 

399
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:27,441
never say,
but you see written and you know the 

400
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:27,441
word and be like,
how am I saying this?

401
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,590
Like I know what this is,
but I can't.

402
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:31,290
I don't say it can't come up with a good
example.

403
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,730
That is one of.
I know what it's funny.

404
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,030
I don't remember ever saying that word.
Oh Roy.

405
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,690
Sometimes we're like,
I never say Reuters,

406
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,660
Reuters news source,
but when I look at it,

407
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,380
I go,
okay,

408
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:45,210
I know what that is.
I've read it a thousand times,

409
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,670
but how do I say that?
Routers,

410
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,320
routers,
routers,

411
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:54,650
Broida sounds right.
It is the right way to say that's what 

412
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,100
everybody says it,
but when left to my own devices,

413
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll just fuck ups pronounced this.
Yeah,

414
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:06,060
I,
I have way too much totally useless 

415
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,220
information going around inside my head.
I got to do some spring cleaning.

416
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,580
I got to throw away your memories.
I to throw away some childhood memories 

417
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,590
that are not serving me.
Just taking up space in my head.

418
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,720
I just.
You run out of hard drive space,

419
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:19,250
man.
Yeah,

420
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:22,410
you do every day you're looking at some 
new story everyday.

421
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,390
There's a new thing going on,
you know,

422
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:27,510
and especially if you're trying to file 
game of thrones and maybe how's of cards

423
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:32,511
to and maybe stranger things.
I remember when I used to remember 

424
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:34,830
everything,
like I could remember every movie,

425
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,690
every part of every part of my childhood
and then now somebody said,

426
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:41,610
remember that time we did this and I'm 
like,

427
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,860
you are there.
Like I remember the time,

428
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,050
I don't remember it that you were there,
but I guess you were.

429
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,860
Yeah,
like now it's my memory's full.

430
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,480
I need to go to the Mac store.
It had some shit added.

431
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,710
Yeah,
but if you were like an old farmer,

432
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,650
you remember all that shit.
It was just every day getting up,

433
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,680
milking the cows,
picking the eggs,

434
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,960
killing a sheep or something for dinner.
You would,

435
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,060
you would,
you would have those memories because 

436
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,370
you're in that same spot everyday.
Thinking about your childhood,

437
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,640
your way from all the distractions come 
in your head.

438
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:20,970
Yeah.
And no books,

439
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,360
no books,
nothing bro.

440
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,450
You gotta eat cheese.
They probably just read one book over 

441
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,000
and over five days.
It's an amazing story,

442
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,020
but it is written in storybook for him.
Well,

443
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:36,270
it's what it was.
Yeah.

444
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,130
The Bible is,
you know,

445
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,830
a fascinating book in that it's,
you start,

446
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,860
you start off with someone telling 
stories for like a thousand years before

447
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:47,650
you write it down

448
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,980
and then you've got a bunch of really 
old versions of the story and no one's 

449
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,521
sure which ones to use.
Like they got the version that's in the 

450
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:01,410
Dead Sea Scrolls,
that's the oldest versions of some of 

451
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:01,410
those stories.
And it's,

452
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,170
it's one of the only,
um,

453
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,590
like,
um,

454
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,820
I think maybe the only one that's 
written in Aramaic or they found it in 

455
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,090
these clay pots and Qumran and Qumran is
an area in Israel.

456
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,230
So they have these like little caves and
they will find these clay pots.

457
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,380
And in these clay pots,
they've got these scrolls that are made 

458
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,380
out of animal skins.
A lot of them.

459
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,410
So they take these scrolls out.
It's so crazy.

460
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,300
Takes like,
I think it took them like 14 to 15 years

461
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:30,760
just to piece it together.
Do they allow,

462
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:35,761
broke it up and shit.
And they couldn't figure out what goes 

463
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:35,761
with what.

464
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,660
So they had to take DNA tests on the,
on the actual pieces of animal skin,

465
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,140
so they could tell,
okay,

466
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:45,310
well this is some skin from this animal,
so let's concentrate on this.

467
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:48,490
All these pieces have been genetically 
tested to be from this animal.

468
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,860
So let's put these together because it 
probably the same scroll.

469
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:56,070
Then they have to like figure out I take
these crumbs and chunks that are just 

470
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,360
thousands of years old,
thousands of years of trust this.

471
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,560
Well not only that,
it's also you're reading it in,

472
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,700
in an ancient ancient land.
You're,

473
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,800
you're reading it in the also like the 
references and the way people thought 

474
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,970
back then.
Yeah.

475
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:19,110
Then they have like the oldest version 
of the Hebrew Bible is like the very 

476
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:24,580
oldest versions were written in ancient 
Hebrew and ancient Hebrews.

477
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,150
Crazy because it has numbers as well as 
letters.

478
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,030
So like,
like if you have a letter a,

479
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,650
it's also the number one.

480
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,990
It's all the same.
So linkedin.

481
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:39,991
So like when you have a word,
like words have like a numerical value 

482
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:44,630
and if I'm butchering this,
if anyone's an ancient Hebrew 

483
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,430
representative.
But Ari and I discussed this for a 

484
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,430
couple of times because Ra,
you know,

485
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,270
went to,
what is it called,

486
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:54,271
like that thing that they send him off 
to that religious camp when he was a 

487
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:55,450
serious,
serious,

488
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,130
a Orthodox Jew.
Oh.

489
00:22:57,131 --> 00:22:59,160
So that's why he's such a serious 
atheist now.

490
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,190
Oh,
he's such a freak now.

491
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,420
But that's exactly why.
But so like their words had numerical 

492
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,690
value.
So the word God and the word love,

493
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,330
they have the same numerical value.
So you know,

494
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,930
like with the letter n the letter o and 
they all have like numbers,

495
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,780
like we can't even think like that 
because none of our words have numerical

496
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:18,460
value.
But like the,

497
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,660
the actual meaning of a word has more 
value with more numbers to it.

498
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,080
It's really interesting.
All that stuff's lost on our stupid 

499
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,590
goofy language because when they 
translated it to Latin,

500
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,580
it translated to Greek or English.
It's all kind of lost.

501
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:38,581
And then who was translating this shit 
and what was everything is based off 

502
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:42,620
like what your goal is or what your 
perception of the world is and where 

503
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,280
you're from or how you were raised.
And what you want this thing to mean

504
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,630
to people,
right?

505
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,510
So like you can't get away from that.
No.

506
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,700
So if you're the person putting this 
stuff together and translate and it's 

507
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,621
like,
how do you not let your influence 

508
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:00,220
influenced this thing you do,
right?

509
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,640
You tweak it.
Little tweak it.

510
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:06,730
Yeah.
You want it to mean the things that it 

511
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,031
means to you.
Even if you just want people to believe 

512
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,060
this is an ancient scroll that you found
and this goes back to you finding it and

513
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:17,140
it goes to your name and to your legacy 
like,

514
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,720
well this also massive amounts of 
evidence of people.

515
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:25,400
I'm looking at something and then having
a distorted perception of what something

516
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:27,950
means and then having that band in their
favor.

517
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,970
Right?
Exactly.

518
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
There's so many points of evidence.
I do that with all my relationships and 

519
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,640
all of them in my,
some of my favorite.

520
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,260
I mean how many people think that 
they're the victim.

521
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,260
How many people were just running around
thinking the world's against the total 

522
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,231
victim and yeah.
So that's just evidence of a bias 

523
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:49,270
thinking,
right?

524
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,300
If you have bias thinking in regards to 
the way that the god of Gods wants to 

525
00:24:55,491 --> 00:25:00,491
govern humanity and our behavior and how
we should behave with each other and 

526
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:04,990
treat each other,
if you look in to let your own personal 

527
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,020
ego and biases get in the way,
which it absolutely did,

528
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:11,420
there's still shit written in the Bible 
that treats women as second class 

529
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:11,810
citizens.
It condoned slavery.

530
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:15,470
There's no.
There's no like talking about slavery as

531
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:17,960
if it's some horrible thing that has to 
be like banished.

532
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,370
Like there's in the ancient Hebrew Bible
condones slavery,

533
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:27,530
they just.
There's really nothing bad about being 

534
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,070
about having slaves.
It's like God doesn't come and kill you,

535
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:30,650
but God will kill you if you were to 
different types of cloth.

536
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,710
I know like,
like they'll burn witches,

537
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,810
like,
you know what you are,

538
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:36,920
which,
why?

539
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,850
Because I said you're a witch,
but you know,

540
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:42,110
it's not evil slaves.
Yeah.

541
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:44,390
The table,
the inquisition,

542
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,750
the during the inquisition,
they weren't torturing people because 

543
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,180
they had slaves because they thought 
they were witches.

544
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,660
They were torturing people because they 
just didn't believe enough in a way.

545
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,240
Yeah,
yeah,

546
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,380
yeah.
What caught you doing something or if 

547
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,661
you want it to get rid of somebody that 
say somebody had a job that you wanted,

548
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,300
a position that you wanted.
If you could prove that that person like

549
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:11,420
slandered God or blast themed or 
anything,

550
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,480
then you're out.
That's the standard maneuver,

551
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:15,050
right?
Yeah.

552
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Oh yeah.
You get the government to get rid of 

553
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,020
this person for you.
That's how you get shit like North Korea

554
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,910
and that's how you get shit like Isis.
You know,

555
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:25,970
you,
you just.

556
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,060
Everybody turned it on everybody.
Everybody trying to figure out a way 

557
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,470
that they can use their power.
But that's what's kind of happening in 

558
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:35,470
America to a little bit.
Yeah.

559
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,170
Yeah.
There was an article in the new,

560
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,910
I think it was the New Yorker just like 
two days ago with the senator.

561
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,100
Um,
was it a senator who wrote.

562
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:43,980
Is that what you just read?
An

563
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,980
article last night is a Republican 
senator and he said when Obama was 

564
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,661
president,
the Republicans made a concerted effort 

565
00:26:53,661 --> 00:26:58,050
to just push the Republican agenda,
make Obama a one term president,

566
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,590
and now that trump has hijack their 
party,

567
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,240
they're kind of turning a blind eye to 
things that they wouldn't have if Obama 

568
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:13,161
was president just because trump is the 
republican candidate.

569
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,490
Huh.
And he's like,

570
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,760
where our loyalties to our party or to 
this country because we're kind of like 

571
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,990
fucking up the country,
you know,

572
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,540
and it's Kinda,
it's Kinda like,

573
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,250
like when Obama was president,
no matter what you think of them,

574
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,050
like if,
if he,

575
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,970
if he was a good president,
right?

576
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,850
Say he's a good president because he's 
not your person,

577
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,540
you're going to shut down the things 
that he's doing to get your party in 

578
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,570
power.
Like you don't give a fuck.

579
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,330
Right?
Because all you care about is your party

580
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,430
winning.
Like,

581
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,830
like,
and now that trump is president,

582
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,010
the Democrats are taken the same thing 
from the same book.

583
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:54,660
And I'm not even saying trump is a good 
president,

584
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:57,180
but I'm just saying everybody's turning 
on everybody.

585
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,230
Yeah,
they're all trying to figure out a way 

586
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,521
to win so they'd get their agenda 
forward and that's not the country's 

587
00:28:04,521 --> 00:28:04,521
agenda.
No at all.

588
00:28:04,521 --> 00:28:08,970
So destroying it,
destroying each other.

589
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:09,750
Well,

590
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,770
it's definitely like a battle between 
the two sides right now,

591
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:17,771
you know,
I mean there's a lot of people that are 

592
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:17,771
getting excited by it.
They take,

593
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:21,761
uh,
they have not just a vested interest in 

594
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:25,601
it,
but it becomes like a part of their 

595
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:25,601
identity to be a part of the resistance 
fighting,

596
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:26,300
fighting against this evil empire,

597
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,300
but at the detriment of like,

598
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:33,700
maybe not.
I mean it really depends because like 

599
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:33,700
when you put a tremendous amount of 
pressure on someone,

600
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,780
like they're putting on trump,
whether you agree with it or not,

601
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,840
it forces that person to realize that 
there's people like that out there and 

602
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,501
you adjust accordingly.
It moves the tied a couple degrees one 

603
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:48,791
way or the other.
It just does like the idea that we're 

604
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:50,460
not culturally malleable that our 
cultures and shift back and forth.

605
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:55,461
It certainly does.
Things that used to be totally 

606
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:58,001
acceptable are now completely taboo.
And that's just over the course of the 

607
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,460
last decade or so.
So I think that even the far left,

608
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,490
it's all necessary.
It just doesn't seem necessary because 

609
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,870
we're caught up in it and we can see if 
we just meet in the middle somewhere can

610
00:29:08,871 --> 00:29:13,871
all be.
But if you just looked at this thing 

611
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:13,871
objectively,
like not,

612
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:16,640
not like a human being even look at it 
at like a mathematic problem,

613
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,370
right?
Like if you could see human culture,

614
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:25,150
you would say,
oh well there's this complete constant 

615
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,080
shift of energy that goes left and right
and left and right,

616
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:30,260
like some crazy ping pong game 
occasionally goes right.

617
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:35,261
And then right again,
very rarely like Reagan and then Bush 

618
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:36,410
senior,
but then it balances itself out and goes

619
00:29:36,411 --> 00:29:39,200
left again.
It's this weird battle.

620
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,220
And along the way if you look at

621
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,310
like if you really step away from it 
along the way,

622
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:49,330
there are incremental changes that are 
moving in a good direction.

623
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,760
It's just hard to see them.
No,

624
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,320
there's a lot of bad shit happened.
Yeah,

625
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:57,270
I get that.
And then we only hear about the stuff,

626
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,300
the bad stuff,
because each side is just trying to get 

627
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,710
points from the other side.
But I.

628
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,530
But I'm just saying it's just that when 
one party,

629
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,900
no matter what party is trying to do 
something good,

630
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,680
even if it's something good,
then the people from the other party are

631
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:17,220
going to be against it because they 
don't want that party to score that good

632
00:30:17,221 --> 00:30:19,530
point.
You then they knocked that off the table

633
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,910
and that thing that could help people is
never going to help people.

634
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,880
I think it's also part of having two 
teams.

635
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:32,210
If think if there was way more teams,
if there was like 20 or 30 different 

636
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:32,340
parties,
we'd be way better off.

637
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:37,580
You're better off.
Politicians are spread across 20 or 30 

638
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,781
different parties instead of jammed into
one or the other or the freaks that are 

639
00:30:41,781 --> 00:30:44,220
independent or green party liquid.
The Fuck Outta here.

640
00:30:44,221 --> 00:30:46,590
Where your Green party,
it's a goofy right?

641
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:48,870
That's no one's going to elect a Green 
party president.

642
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,830
All the bankers are going to put a stop 
to that.

643
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,440
This guy's just going to steal money 
from us.

644
00:30:52,441 --> 00:30:54,540
Fuck,
this is going to give it to penguins and

645
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:55,640
shit.
You know what I mean?

646
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,160
That's going to give out money to 
penguin.

647
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,000
So you've got really three choices.
You've got independent,

648
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:05,001
which is so rare.
The only person that I could think ever 

649
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:07,671
winning as an independent right now 
honestly would be someone like trump or 

650
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:09,780
like elon musk,
mark Cuban,

651
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,840
you know,
trump is basically an independent who 

652
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:14,840
hijack Republican Party.
Well,

653
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,500
he's,
he voted Democrat like his whole life.

654
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,280
He was pro choice like his whole life.
You know,

655
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,120
it's like he's been on the side of a 
democratic issues forever.

656
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:24,990
Right?
I mean,

657
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:29,880
I saw the video where he said,
I saw the video right the day before.

658
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:34,970
I saw it twice.
The last time I saw it was the day 

659
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,020
before the election where he said if I 
was going to run,

660
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,550
I would run as a Republican because 
Republicans are stupid and blah,

661
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:41,840
blah,
blah.

662
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,130
I saw that video,
like him being interviewed.

663
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,690
I tell you the next day that shit was 
scrubbed from the Internet and if I tell

664
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:49,950
people I saw that video,
they said,

665
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:50,580
no,
you're crazy.

666
00:31:50,581 --> 00:31:51,180
It was just like,

667
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,030
so he really had it taken down.
Yeah,

668
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:54,870
man.
Dude,

669
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,550
that's like some l Ron Hubbard type 
shit.

670
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Ron Hubbard was quoted as saying that if
you really want to make money should 

671
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,040
start a religion,
and he started.

672
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,370
Scientology wasn't bullshit.
Tell the truth.

673
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,810
They got so much for coming.
Yeah.

674
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:11,670
He's a fascinating character,
man.

675
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:17,390
I mean obviously there's a tremendous 
amount of issues with him not telling 

676
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,420
the truth.
That might be the biggest problem.

677
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,140
The number one biggest problem might be 
the line that we can't trust them.

678
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,430
That is so crazy that you have a 
president that just lies all the time,

679
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,990
but if you step away from the lying part
and you look at like what he's doing.

680
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:36,110
What's interesting is this is,
I don't know too much about the 

681
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,781
affordable care act or Obamacare,
but I do know that a whole lot of people

682
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:43,880
voted against it,
are now voting against repealing it.

683
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,190
Alright.
So it either means one of two things,

684
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:48,950
right?
It means trump's plan is so bad that the

685
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:52,370
people hated obamacare.
This is even worse.

686
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:58,660
Or it's a bunch of people that just 
don't like trump and even though they 

687
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,050
didn't want obamacare in the first 
place,

688
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,180
no matter what trump comes up with,
they're going to be like,

689
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:05,120
fuck you,
we're going to fight against that.

690
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:08,030
Which maybe there's a few other.
It could be this or it could be that,

691
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,760
but those two to me are pretty 
fascinating.

692
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:12,290
That's like childish shit.

693
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,330
Yeah.
That's the whole.

694
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,440
It's fitness child.
Just like.

695
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,480
I just feel like everybody's just going 
after everybody.

696
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:21,481
And when you spend your time going after
people to remove them from their 

697
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:25,051
position,
what are you doing for the people when 

698
00:33:25,051 --> 00:33:26,470
you're going after like a,
your own selfish gain,

699
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,480
you're spending your entire time in 
office trying to get one step up.

700
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,520
Well,
he's got a lot of steps out.

701
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,970
That was not just him but everybody else
under him.

702
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,890
Plus him trying.
Now he's trying to stay up.

703
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,820
He had to spend his day fighting shit.
Right,

704
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,110
right.
Instead of solving shit.

705
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:44,910
Yeah.
He's,

706
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,400
he's,
well,

707
00:33:45,401 --> 00:33:47,560
he fights people on twitter.
People on twitter,

708
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:47,890
on

709
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,310
world,
right when the president,

710
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:53,050
United States,
kind of the president of the world,

711
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,720
like you might not be running these 
other countries,

712
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:58,840
but everybody knows is the country that 
has all the fucking bombs and it's crazy

713
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:00,070
enough to use them.
Right?

714
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:05,250
So this is the president of the arguably
the greatest army in the world's ever 

715
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,631
known.
That's the commander in chief right 

716
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,161
there.
They talk shit about people on twitter 

717
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:12,190
talking shit about people having plastic
surgery.

718
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:17,191
Scars bleeding badly from a facelift.
I see New York so crazy.

719
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,770
It's so crazy and people are so angry 
and I get it.

720
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,630
I get it.
I get everybody being angry.

721
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,610
I get it.
It's not what I'm saying.

722
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,120
I'm just saying it is.
The whole thing is so surreal.

723
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,750
It's like everybody wanted change and 
then when change came you're like,

724
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:34,980
no,
no,

725
00:34:34,981 --> 00:34:36,400
no.
This change is making money.

726
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:37,250
Like,
no,

727
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,420
no,
no.

728
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,310
We don't want that.
This guy's stealing money.

729
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,020
Like he's,
he's going to make billions of dollars.

730
00:34:41,021 --> 00:34:43,330
Like what the fuck is he doing?
Where's his tax returns?

731
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:48,570
Show me the tax red turns.
But I think what's going to come out of 

732
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:53,101
it is that there's so many people now 
that are politically motivated.

733
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,200
There's so many people that are looking 
at this whole thing on,

734
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:56,560
whoa,
whoa,

735
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,040
Whoa,
whoa.

736
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:59,740
You can't just sit back and just let 
this happen.

737
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:05,130
Then you get someone who doesn't tell 
the truth as the president and that you 

738
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,250
know how bad that fucks up kids.
Right?

739
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,140
When you're looking at like the highest 
level of human being in the country.

740
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,530
Like if every kid says,
who?

741
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,870
Billy,
what do you want to be when you grow up?

742
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,480
I want to be approved.
Yeah,

743
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,840
that's the issue.
Yeah.

744
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,250
Jam.
You want to be the president.

745
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,840
You don't only want to be the vice 
president.

746
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,450
You want to be the command.
You want to be the number one guy that's

747
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:24,250
an amputee.
So possible.

748
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:29,910
Yeah.
But it's also like if the guy who's the 

749
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,690
guy at the top of the list is embedded 
than people that you know,

750
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,900
like his mind is petty.
Petty.

751
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:35,910
He's,
he,

752
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,730
he,
he goofs people that just don't like his

753
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,550
policies.
He'll talk shit about like their plastic

754
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:43,150
surgery.
Right?

755
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,200
A guy with fake hair is talking about 
people bleeding from surgery.

756
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:54,670
Oh,
but it's just like the whole hurt your 

757
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:54,870
feelings thing,
the lash out and hurt your feelings,

758
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:55,910
things like that.
So he's trying to do,

759
00:35:55,930 --> 00:36:00,930
trying to hurt their feelings.
Like someone just needs to like sit him 

760
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:00,930
down and

761
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,190
I think they tried.
He,

762
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,750
he ain't listening.
He's the one that's his way.

763
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,570
I know he is.
He won but he won that way.

764
00:36:07,571 --> 00:36:10,150
So he's like,
that's how I won my base.

765
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:10,660
Likes that.

766
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:15,740
Got To let it in.
You got to let that go because you have 

767
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,970
a,
you have a broader responsibility as the

768
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:19,080
head guy.

769
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,500
I think he's getting feedback that 
enough that he has the amazing ability 

770
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,660
to ignore,
to ignore things that I wouldn't ignore 

771
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,450
and now I think most people wouldn't 
ignore,

772
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,970
like,
like blow back,

773
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:34,780
like,

774
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,380
like I remember.
So this is what happened when one time I

775
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:44,020
went to see a movie screening with Kevin
Hart was in it with Asha.

776
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,300
There's a long time ago and me and Kevin
with friends,

777
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:52,301
we used to hang out.
So we went to the screening and we sat 

778
00:36:52,301 --> 00:36:55,481
there and we watched the movie and the 
movie was terrible.

779
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,170
So then after the movie I'm gonna see 
cap.

780
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:05,830
So my worry is like,
what the fuck am I going to tell this 

781
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:05,830
guy because I can't lie to him about 
this movie.

782
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,870
And before I said anything,
he looked at me and said,

783
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,520
man,
that movie was bad,

784
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:15,140
but I was great.
And you know what he was right here.

785
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:22,100
So he brushed off like how bad the movie
and found something.

786
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:28,850
This motherfucker,
trump can find something like he could 

787
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,150
heal here.
What he needs to hear from whatever is 

788
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,750
done.
They've probably enough people,

789
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,050
events,
even one or a few million that likes his

790
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:42,051
tweets.
Like we only see the people that hate 

791
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:42,051
his tweets.

792
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:42,051
Right?
Oh,

793
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:46,571
there's a lot of people that like sweets
at all have American flags in their 

794
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:46,571
avatars.
So he's gonna go for that.

795
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:49,220
They have like eagles and Dobermans and 
American flags guns.

796
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,190
Um,
what is,

797
00:37:52,191 --> 00:37:53,090
uh,
the recent.

798
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:55,670
He gave some recent speech where I 
thought was really truck.

799
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,400
No,
no,

800
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:56,960
no,
no.

801
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:02,020
That was good one too.
But I think it was today where he was 

802
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,600
talking about unemployment,
being down,

803
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:07,930
how I'm of the economy is up and all 
these different factors,

804
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,790
and they were talking about how no one 
mentions it.

805
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:13,250
And then I went to CNN and I was like,
yeah,

806
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:16,100
they're not even mentioning that he's 
given this speech.

807
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:17,630
And he's saying all the like,
how much,

808
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,550
how much should that be?
The number one story.

809
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:21,890
Like what's the number one store when 
you go to CNN,

810
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,590
go to the front page of CNN.
What do we got here?

811
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,140
What does it say?
Highest stock market ever.

812
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:29,450
Best economic numbers and years 
unemployment.

813
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:32,060
Lowest and 17 years wages.
Rising.

814
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:33,020
Border secure.

815
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,760
Yeah.
But wait,

816
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,790
is that true?
Well,

817
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,030
I don't know if that's true though,
but I,

818
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,090
I don't know if it's probably true.
Right?

819
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:45,540
But these were the same things that will
happening when Obama was president and 

820
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:49,810
he used to shit on it.
He used to say it's not rising enough.

821
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:55,350
The unemployed,
the unemployment level should still be 

822
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,441
lower.
Or like when they put out the job gains 

823
00:38:58,441 --> 00:39:02,191
or whatever they call that shit.
Technically he would say that's not 

824
00:39:02,191 --> 00:39:03,640
enough growth,
so there is a way to shit on everything,

825
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,600
but look at all this.

826
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,960
Look at what they show on CNN.
Like right away you see on the top,

827
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,900
trump weighed in on sons,
misleading claim breaking news.

828
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:18,901
So you've got a negative trump ad,
no inaccuracy in Donald Trump's junior 

829
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:21,160
statements,
about 2016 meeting with Russians.

830
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:25,030
White House says White House comments on
Donald Trump jr statements,

831
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:30,330
timeline of dot.
So none of that as anything to do with 

832
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:30,970
unemployment being down or the economy 
being up.

833
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:35,920
And this is like the front page of CNN.
It's all negative.

834
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,950
They're going to have to for sure,
but this is not good.

835
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,240
It's not good to do that.
Like you're not given all the news.

836
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,070
You got to give the news like he does 
plenty of stupid shit that you can cover

837
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,970
your as short of stupid shit.
But when good shit happens,

838
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,420
like when the economy is up,
when unemployment is down,

839
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,890
he probably,
she'd be reporting that.

840
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,100
It seems like that's new,

841
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,200
but all right,
so if it's true,

842
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,940
if it's true,
right?

843
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:03,840
Okay.
Your,

844
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,670
your,
you know,

845
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:07,800
you have a powerful twitter,
your name is trump,

846
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:13,190
right.
And you know this and you know the game 

847
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,190
by now,
right.

848
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,500
So you know,
if you tweet about some woman's plastic 

849
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,910
surgery,
they're going to go in on you.

850
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,680
Yeah.
And that's what's going to be on CNN,

851
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:23,070
CNN,

852
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,660
but that's not CNN or MSNBC.

853
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:30,650
Right.
But he is going to be on every news,

854
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,590
all the media outlets that are not in 
favor of,

855
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:35,210
you are going to put that.
Right.

856
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,520
So everyone except Fox,
everyone except Fox.

857
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,700
So it's like stop putting shit that 
people can use to cover up and use 

858
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:48,740
instead of the employment,
unemployment stuff being down.

859
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:53,741
You know what I mean?
When you mean stop giving people ammo 

860
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:53,741
against you.
Right.

861
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:55,580
You know what I mean?
Stop giving them information.

862
00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:01,330
Negative stuff that they can put on the 
front of their website instead of 

863
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,230
unemployment numbers going down.

864
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,040
Yeah.
But there's no way they're going to stop

865
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:09,540
that as long as their stories like that.
Like Donald Jr secretly meeting with the

866
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:14,541
Russians and not telling people and then
release in the emails and then saying 

867
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:14,541
it.
You know,

868
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:18,651
all that stuff and then it turns out 
that trump was the one who coordinated 

869
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:20,120
the statement about it and like all that
stuff.

870
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,660
It's never gonna stop fucking up.
Yeah.

871
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,310
He's fucking up.
But here's the thing.

872
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,300
You got to write the good stuff too.
Yeah.

873
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,120
Yeah.
You have to have write news.

874
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,010
Yeah.
I mean I feel like if I'm going to trust

875
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:34,050
you for the news I want.
I

876
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,680
would like to think as a person who 
leans very left,

877
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,800
I would like to think that CNN is going 
to be better than right wing agenda 

878
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:41,890
websites.
Well,

879
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,000
how can they not be?
That's,

880
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,040
that's very disappointing.
It's very disappointing.

881
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,120
Couldn't have both thing.

882
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:51,220
I don't trust none of them.
I don't trust the news or the because 

883
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,080
you know why?
Because when Obama was president or just

884
00:41:55,081 --> 00:42:00,081
in presidents before,
like a lot of shit was phony and false.

885
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,250
You know what I mean?
Like they just did it.

886
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:08,290
Here's a funny thing.
So they just did a study of like body 

887
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,290
cams on cops.
Right?

888
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,240
And just did a study and they said from 
the study they see that cops treat black

889
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:23,530
people that they pull over worst than 
they treat white people say 

890
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,060
motherfucker,
we've been trying to tell you that,

891
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:31,870
but now it's only official when white 
people did the study,

892
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,560
they like,
they like,

893
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,220
you know what,
this thing is true,

894
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,190
but been trying to tell you that shit is
true for a long time,

895
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,300
but that's just a part of.
It's like you're not covering anything 

896
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,890
that doesn't serve you.
You know what I mean?

897
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:54,430
You're not.
You're not covering anything that 

898
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:54,430
doesn't serve you anymore.

899
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:54,430
Yeah.
But their news,

900
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,731
they're not cops.
I can understand like cops being racist 

901
00:42:57,731 --> 00:42:58,430
that I get that.
But if you're,

902
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:03,431
if you're the news source,
like you have to just distribute the 

903
00:43:03,431 --> 00:43:07,661
news.
You can't selectively decide after 10 

904
00:43:07,661 --> 00:43:10,530
and can't hear you when you focus on you
have to and you should never have.

905
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,010
Well they should.
They never.

906
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:17,100
They showed but then they just never 
have obvious know what's really fucked 

907
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,980
up.
That isn't really getting nearly as much

908
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:23,981
press as I think it should get.
Or people haven't really been talking 

909
00:43:23,981 --> 00:43:26,831
about that much is how many people were 
concentrating on that white lady from 

910
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:30,110
Australia who got shot unnecessarily by 
the cop.

911
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:35,130
Right.
Because she was a white lady from 

912
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:35,130
Australia.
Right.

913
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:35,510
That look,
no matter what you say,

914
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:40,511
what that is is.
I mean obviously it's a tragic accident 

915
00:43:40,511 --> 00:43:40,610
because she was the one that called the 
cops and then they shot her,

916
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:45,611
but you know,
many times they've done that to other 

917
00:43:45,611 --> 00:43:45,611
people.

918
00:43:45,611 --> 00:43:46,970
But that's my whole point is like the 
news serves it.

919
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:50,150
Remember talking about the scrolls and 
how you can't.

920
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,510
If you found a skull,
the scrolls,

921
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,520
you can't help but make a story that is 
in your favor.

922
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,360
Right?
Like,

923
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:04,510
I forgot the exact words you used,
but it's just because your perception is

924
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:06,560
going to come through in this thing.
To me,

925
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,780
that's how the news has been all my 
life.

926
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:14,020
Like whoever owns the news makes news in
there.

927
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:19,110
Faith always has been since William 
Randolph hearst hearst publications,

928
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,960
so that,
that to me the news has always been,

929
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:25,200
even if it was slightly inaccurate 
before,

930
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,910
it's just being growingly not accurate.
Yeah,

931
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,670
but that drives people fucking crazy.
You mean that it does people,

932
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:37,120
because like when I was a kid,
like a stupid little kid and I was 

933
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,881
watching the news just stupid enough to 
think like when somebody's telling me 

934
00:44:40,881 --> 00:44:42,300
what's going on in the world,
I'm like,

935
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,660
the news is God,
like because they thought that it was 

936
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,060
all real.
That was like just like,

937
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:50,640
not just like a kid that's like you 
don't know any better,

938
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,590
but how did these people know 
everything?

939
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:57,660
They're telling you everything.
So you're kind of getting programmed to 

940
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:01,371
believe this shit.
So people are getting programmed to 

941
00:45:01,371 --> 00:45:01,371
believe Fox,
MSNBC,

942
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,950
CNN,
and they don't know any better and they 

943
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,711
get an angry based on what they're being
told and we're not being told 

944
00:45:09,711 --> 00:45:11,010
everything.
We're not being told everything.

945
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:13,200
Like you're saying,
they're not showing both sides,

946
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,030
right or everything.
They're not.

947
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,300
There's no reason for the people who own
the news to be fair.

948
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,640
That's true.
They just have to get people to pay 

949
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,340
attention to get people get so they.
The third thing is how do I make money?

950
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,260
Right.
It'd be outrageous.

951
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,780
It got to be outrageous.
We've got gotta we got to,

952
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,470
even though we got to follow this Russia
story and we got to make money.

953
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,530
This is a soap opera.
This is game of thrones going on,

954
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:41,220
on fucking TV.
This is like when Katrina,

955
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:46,250
they milk the shit out of Katrina and 
any tragedy and they're just milking 

956
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,290
this.
That's like every like why is everything

957
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,250
coming out?
Like,

958
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:55,530
all right,
so there was a meeting to then it was 

959
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:55,530
email.
So then like,

960
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,760
like it's almost as if somebody wrote a 
script and we're going today,

961
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:58,140
we're going to give you this part of it 
today.

962
00:45:58,141 --> 00:46:03,141
We're going to give you this part of it.
Like it's like it's unfolding like a TV 

963
00:46:03,141 --> 00:46:04,140
show keeping peoples interest

964
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,790
in a lot of ways.
It is like that house of cards,

965
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:09,450
show house of cards.
Yeah.

966
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:14,560
I'm in,
in almost even less believable like 

967
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:14,650
everybody was like in the house of 
cards.

968
00:46:14,651 --> 00:46:16,260
It's polar.
Um,

969
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,970
I can't even say,
I don't want to say what happens,

970
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:24,600
but um,
there's some moments on the show where 

971
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:24,600
people go,
well that would never happen.

972
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,500
That's who would get elect.
Like look at the,

973
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:31,530
what the fuck is happening?
The president's daughter is always 

974
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:31,660
behind him with a giant smile on her 
face.

975
00:46:31,661 --> 00:46:33,340
Every time he says anything and she's 
clapping.

976
00:46:33,341 --> 00:46:35,380
Like today,
it's like he's got his kids in.

977
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,120
Their kids are running shit.

978
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:42,870
Supposed to be running this company.
He's supposed to be away from his 

979
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,870
company,
but that's not.

980
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,720
You wouldn't even show his tax returns.
The whole thing.

981
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,190
So gangster.
It's so poot NASC.

982
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:52,450
It's really fascinating.
And now with this thing that's going on 

983
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:52,450
with Russia,
I mean,

984
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:53,660
who knows?
I might be just nonsense.

985
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,280
They might just be posture and with each
other.

986
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,110
Meanwhile they're doing deals behind the
scenes.

987
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:57,740
It's like,
I'll tell you,

988
00:46:57,741 --> 00:46:59,290
what am I do bro,
Bro?

989
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:01,010
And I'm gonna.
Kick the delicates out.

990
00:47:01,011 --> 00:47:02,660
I'm going to get pissed,
pissed,

991
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:08,170
and meanwhile they're making some crazy 
deal to like tap into the oil and the 

992
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:08,170
art Antarctica.

993
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,480
Sure.
They're kicking the delegates out.

994
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,600
Maybe maybe,
maybe to look like maths to look like,

995
00:47:12,601 --> 00:47:14,260
Hey,
I'm not on.

996
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:17,920
If I was a friend of trump,
I wouldn't kick your delegates out exact

997
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:18,720
maybe.
Right?

998
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,670
Why would I kick the diplomats out?
Yeah,

999
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,620
if I'm working with them.
Come on,

1000
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:24,460
man.
Yeah,

1001
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,210
right.
Yeah,

1002
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:26,500
they did.
Just going back and forth.

1003
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:33,080
It's also strange.
It's so strange that people could still 

1004
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,271
rock it like that.
Like you still could be a dictator in 

1005
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:39,361
2017.
That is one of the last remaining like 

1006
00:47:39,361 --> 00:47:42,910
archaic jobs.
Like the one dude running everything guy

1007
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:45,460
with a giant army.
Everybody keep it together.

1008
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,900
Keep it together.
You could have a safe life.

1009
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,180
Keep it together.
Don't fucking push me.

1010
00:47:49,181 --> 00:47:50,440
Just give me a little money.
Right?

1011
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,000
What's it hurt you to give me a little 
money?

1012
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,590
You can't give me 30 percent of your 
money.

1013
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,360
Come on man.
Give me 50 percent.

1014
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,580
It's not that big a deal.
I mean that's,

1015
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,970
that's what a lot of countries are stuck
in right now,

1016
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,790
you know,
and in,

1017
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,620
in Russia with.

1018
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,320
The crazy thing is if it doesn't go well
for you,

1019
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:09,820
they just take your company.
He's a multibillionaire oligarchs.

1020
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:12,190
They just lock these two top,
lock them up,

1021
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,880
take the company confiscated,
just throw in a jail cell,

1022
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,360
keeping there for game of thrones.
And it was that amount,

1023
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:23,440
dude.
I was watching this documentary about 

1024
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,410
this Russian guy who was a,
and he was at first,

1025
00:48:26,411 --> 00:48:29,920
he loves working with trump and somehow 
or another he disagreed with trump.

1026
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:32,620
Now trump rather than two,
that's like,

1027
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,630
that's some fraud shit.
Uh,

1028
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,240
he was uh,
working with,

1029
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:42,270
I'm trying to remember the full story,
but he had some sort of a business 

1030
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:45,910
arrangement with Putin and then he tried
to change it or he didn't want to accept

1031
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:48,400
new terms or whatever.
They just locked his ass up.

1032
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,520
He opposed something that Putin wanted 
to do.

1033
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,070
Good.
Yeah.

1034
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,460
Sorry Dude.
He complained.

1035
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,380
He protested.
Sorry Dude.

1036
00:48:57,381 --> 00:48:58,990
And they put some charges on him.
Yeah.

1037
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,830
They put some charges on him,
threw him in jail.

1038
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,790
And who knows,
man,

1039
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:06,910
they might look.
If you get to be some crazy 

1040
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,330
multibillionaire dude in Russia,
they probably don't even let you in 

1041
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:10,910
there unless you've done some fucked up 
shit with them.

1042
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,100
They probably listened to like,
you know,

1043
00:49:13,101 --> 00:49:16,660
you've got good.
Don't vote with us on.

1044
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,710
I mean,
even on the lowest level,

1045
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:24,820
you have to get jumped into a gang and 
you got to commit a crime to be a part 

1046
00:49:24,951 --> 00:49:29,951
of the gang,
so they got to see you do some dirt to 

1047
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:29,951
see you get it.
If a gang would do that,

1048
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:34,850
why wouldn't a bunch of billionaires who
have way more to protect?

1049
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,280
Yeah,
make you do some dirt with them,

1050
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:42,590
do some dirt,
and also show that you're crazy enough 

1051
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:42,590
to be down with them.
Yeah.

1052
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:43,490
They like,
yeah,

1053
00:49:43,491 --> 00:49:45,470
I like you,
but I need to know if you're loyal.

1054
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:48,860
You know what red told me that met his 
dad do in the Israeli army,

1055
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,360
what?
You've raised a kitten.

1056
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,120
You raise it,
you take care of it by yourself,

1057
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:58,121
you pet it,
and then when it gets to be like a year 

1058
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:59,980
old,
you've got to kill it in front of them 

1059
00:49:59,980 --> 00:49:59,980
with your bare hands.
Grab it,

1060
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,490
snapped its neck just to show that you 
can do that.

1061
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,380
I was like,
whoa.

1062
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,660
Part of the game is that.
I was like,

1063
00:50:06,661 --> 00:50:09,720
Whoa,
just to show that you could shut it off.

1064
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,780
Like you've got that ability to just 
shut it off like you have this cat,

1065
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:14,520
you love it.
Urine,

1066
00:50:14,521 --> 00:50:16,410
you're going to kill that thing with 
your hands.

1067
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,120
Well,
if you could do that,

1068
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:20,670
they make you do that now.
I mean,

1069
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,760
why?
Why you have to get coal signed to get 

1070
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:25,930
into billionaire club?
Yeah.

1071
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:26,740
You got to kill people.

1072
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,350
You think?
What do they do with like gala?

1073
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:34,280
Guys like Jeff Bezos at Amazon guy.
You ever see the photos of him?

1074
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:39,520
Solaris is a photo of him.
Like when he first started out like 12 

1075
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,791
years ago about this battle scene.
Dorky and then you look at him now it 

1076
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:45,881
looks like a fucking assassin.
He's got sunglasses on his walking 

1077
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:49,820
aggressive t r t,
t e r t hilarious.

1078
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,210
He's got like a girl on each side of him
or something like that.

1079
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:55,190
I'm sure.
I mean,

1080
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:57,260
how much is he worth now?
He's looking at them.

1081
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:02,400
It looks like a killer so that man,
he literally looks like a guy hit man.

1082
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:07,470
I just hired.
That was like a former navy seal that's 

1083
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,140
coming over to give you advice on how to
secure your corporation.

1084
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,560
You know,
like he would show up at apple and hire 

1085
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:14,960
a bunch of Hitman.
That's him now.

1086
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:16,430
Is that what that is?
A little while ago.

1087
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,000
He's pretty fit guy.
Yeah.

1088
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:21,650
Now,
but he seems like a a fit guy.

1089
00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:22,520
Look,
he works out.

1090
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,750
See?
Well there was,

1091
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,110
but there was a before and after picture
man.

1092
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:29,640
Goofy,
goofy town.

1093
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,630
Okay.
Yeah.

1094
00:51:30,631 --> 00:51:34,650
He was a little goofy.
But look man figured out how to dominate

1095
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,260
online sales.
I use Amazon.com

1096
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,140
all the time there.
No camera in the diesel.

1097
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:45,500
All three of them.
So the rock was at the fights this 

1098
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:45,630
weekend.
Oh,

1099
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,400
well give him a hug.
It's like hugging a tree.

1100
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,890
The big tree.
I wonder how much that dude.

1101
00:51:49,891 --> 00:51:52,470
Ways with two big rock to big Bro.
He's.

1102
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,430
He's in the to 50 range for sure.
Yeah,

1103
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:57,360
for sure.
He's gigantic.

1104
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:00,390
Like you don't realize how big he is 
until you give them a hug.

1105
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,180
They old friendly guy,
but that guy gets bombarded.

1106
00:52:03,181 --> 00:52:04,020
Man.
He can't.

1107
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,850
He can't go anywhere without taking 
pictures.

1108
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,350
They just,
they don't,

1109
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:09,090
they don't give a fuck if you're talking
to them.

1110
00:52:09,091 --> 00:52:14,091
They get in between you.
They put their pump to hold their 

1111
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:14,091
camera.

1112
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,200
It's ridiculous.
Like people just,

1113
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:21,580
they don't give a fuck about decorum or 
be in friendlies.

1114
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,070
And I'm getting this fucking picture 
with the rock.

1115
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:25,890
It's my one chance.
Yeah,

1116
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,460
they just swoop in,
man.

1117
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:30,610
Anything for the grand man.
But it's weird.

1118
00:52:30,611 --> 00:52:34,780
It's like I'm all your um,
normal etiquette goes out the window.

1119
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,050
Like the rock was sitting over there 
talking to what demetrius mighty mouse,

1120
00:52:38,051 --> 00:52:43,051
Johnson pound for pound best fighter in 
the world and they're talking back and 

1121
00:52:43,051 --> 00:52:43,540
forth and having a good time and let's 
do,

1122
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:46,920
just swoops in between them.
One pops up and he's like,

1123
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,510
can I get a picture bro?
Go get a picture bro.

1124
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:54,030
And you know,
you see the rock has always been 

1125
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:54,030
friendly.
He's,

1126
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:54,400
he's amazing at staying friendly,
but you know,

1127
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:55,650
he's like,
God damn.

1128
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:57,130
Can't even talk to the champ.

1129
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,400
Yeah man.
I mean

1130
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:02,800
if he wants to follow us,
he wants to.

1131
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,630
Yeah,
I guess he's a nice guy.

1132
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,790
He's a real lifestyle.
He's a real nice guy.

1133
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,600
But the giant.
You're done bro.

1134
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,780
Just needs to get bigger.
Nah Man.

1135
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,360
You think you think he's done anything?
Stop lifting.

1136
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,920
Yeah,
it's a project,

1137
00:53:17,921 --> 00:53:18,910
right?
If it's a sculpture,

1138
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,030
I mean,
what's,

1139
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:21,850
is he trying to go after this?
Like what's,

1140
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:26,880
what's left?
But he's trying to stay jacked and he's 

1141
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:26,880
like 48 or some

1142
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,120
shit.
How old was the rock?

1143
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,180
I would say he's about 40.
You can take a week off.

1144
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:30,860
No,
no,

1145
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,250
no you can't.
That's the thing.

1146
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:38,690
I'm 45,
so he's 45 and he's shacked just ready 

1147
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:43,680
man.
He's jacked.

1148
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:46,710
He's wants to keep that and there's only
one way.

1149
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,650
You got to do what he does that 
motherfucker off every day.

1150
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:50,940
He does.
He's a,

1151
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:54,330
he'll make these videos when he shows up
in places like Germany.

1152
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:55,950
He's got a film,
some fucking movie.

1153
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,470
He's there at 5:00
in the morning.

1154
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,550
They already have an elliptical machine 
in his,

1155
00:53:59,551 --> 00:54:00,720
uh,
in his,

1156
00:54:00,721 --> 00:54:01,680
uh,
in his bed,

1157
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,320
in his,
in his hotel room who get like a sweet.

1158
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:09,950
So they have set up this elliptical 
machine in his suite and he's out there 

1159
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:11,850
banging it out at 5:00
in the morning doing an hour of cardio.

1160
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:15,720
I know him and a Kevin Hart videos 
bugged me.

1161
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,690
Did it make you feel lazy?
It just working out.

1162
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,580
Doing.
They've done more by 7:00

1163
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,740
AM then I'm going to do all day.
Yeah.

1164
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,170
It's rude and they try to motivate 
people like,

1165
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,480
hey man,
trying to sleep over here bro.

1166
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,700
Scroll up,
scroll up a little bit there.

1167
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:37,790
The one on the far right hand side with 
him pulling that rowing machine right 

1168
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,990
above that one.
That's a doing some rows.

1169
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:45,030
That dude's I can't take.
That's a gigantic person.

1170
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:49,650
Poor rowing machine does not deserve 
this.

1171
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:55,610
Yeah,
but if you want to put these things up 

1172
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:56,280
and get how many millions of views,
how many million views that have $6,

1173
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,540
million,
630,

1174
00:54:57,541 --> 00:54:59,340
9,000.
Eight hundred and 98.

1175
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:04,460
Overuse of him showing off.
Dealing paroles we get it.

1176
00:55:04,591 --> 00:55:09,591
You wake up in the morning,
but he's motivating people sometimes 

1177
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:13,710
like you'll be sitting at home and 
feeling like a lazy bitch.

1178
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:16,560
Like I just want to chill today.
I don't feel like working out.

1179
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:21,270
And he goes see the rock to get changed 
wrapped around his neck and Chin ups did

1180
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,220
tiring.
Yeah.

1181
00:55:23,221 --> 00:55:25,530
Hit tires with missiles.
Yeah.

1182
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,390
It's weird.
He's a crazy man.

1183
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:32,960
But those are the dudes that like,
you need to know that like as hard as 

1184
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,290
you think you're working.
Drop one down from there.

1185
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:37,650
That one was the other one that went to 
jail.

1186
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:39,270
Yeah,
we'll look at that right there.

1187
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,660
You need to know as hard as you think 
you're working,

1188
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,160
you know,
working that hard.

1189
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,950
I know.
Look at that guys.

1190
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:54,890
So if you,
if you think you've done everything you 

1191
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:57,411
can to be prosperous in this life.
And then you go to the rocks instagram 

1192
00:55:57,411 --> 00:55:59,550
and shut your fucking hippie mouth.
Fuck your day up.

1193
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,120
Fuck it there.
This is what you didn't do today.

1194
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,730
And I know people like,
well,

1195
00:56:05,731 --> 00:56:06,730
hey man,
I read a book to.

1196
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,820
Okay.
Hey Man,

1197
00:56:07,821 --> 00:56:09,610
I've been writing poetry all day.
Hey Man,

1198
00:56:09,611 --> 00:56:10,690
I've been writing songs.
Payment.

1199
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,620
Okay,
okay.

1200
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,720
But have you put the same amount of 
effort into being whatever you want as 

1201
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,880
the rock has done and being the ultimate
meathead.

1202
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,070
Whenever it's hilarious.
Ultimately I'll

1203
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,940
get this.
Whenever I look at that,

1204
00:56:26,941 --> 00:56:31,941
that looks at the bar.
A bar has got to change things on the 

1205
00:56:31,941 --> 00:56:31,941
side.
Don't.

1206
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,750
Do you know why you have chains?
Makes the end of the rep harder.

1207
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,840
She says,
as you lift the chains up off the 

1208
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,941
ground,
less of the chain is being supported by 

1209
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:43,681
the ground.
So it gets heavier and heavier as you 

1210
00:56:43,681 --> 00:56:43,681
lift your hands up higher.
That's called hardcore.

1211
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:49,020
I don't know if you boys,
you're aware of whole hardcore hardcore 

1212
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,230
can get that.
So hardcore that show hardcore.

1213
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,370
Listen,
when I want to feel bad about my day,

1214
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,350
I just go to the rocks.
Instagram.

1215
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:58,330
It's a good movie.
Shit.

1216
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,880
What's going on with this guy?
For that movie?

1217
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:01,570
Rampage.
He has.

1218
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:03,850
This guy's going to be a gorilla or.
Oh Wow.

1219
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:09,120
Oh.
So he's got like one of those suits on 

1220
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:09,120
that.
Maps is video games.

1221
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:13,400
Suits.
Isn't that weird that they still can't 

1222
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,710
completely just fake it.
They have to have a dude move around and

1223
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:15,520
close.
I mean,

1224
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:20,521
I'm at a hollow Lens.
Stuff that we were talking about 

1225
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:23,670
yesterday.
There's gonna be able to wear those and 

1226
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:24,220
see pretty much what they're going to 
like the final CGI rendering.

1227
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,900
Like they can just act with that stuff 
soon.

1228
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:28,360
It's amazing what you know,
like,

1229
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:33,550
uh,
I watched a game of thrones first 

1230
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:33,550
episode and you know,
that that boat's not real.

1231
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,230
They don't really have that giant,
massive,

1232
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,780
crazy looking boat cutting through the 
ocean.

1233
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,930
That's not a real boat,
but God damn it looks like a real boat.

1234
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,220
Yeah.
That shit was crazy.

1235
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:46,320
That attack was fucking totally don't 
say that,

1236
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,170
but you look at it,
these boats mean the,

1237
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,220
just the CGI.
It's just for a television show.

1238
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,200
Yeah.
They spend millions.

1239
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,920
I guess it's like worth it to spend 
money on those episodes.

1240
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,540
Oh yeah.
Each one is millions.

1241
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:02,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

1242
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,330
But I guess it's worth it,
right?

1243
00:58:04,331 --> 00:58:05,990
Because that thing will sell forever.
Yeah,

1244
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,660
I like it.
If it goes down today,

1245
00:58:07,661 --> 00:58:11,020
like it's also timeless,
like game of thrones is timeless.

1246
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:14,080
Like that'd be worth a shitload of money
10 years from now,

1247
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:19,490
and I was like,
the soprano's is timeless to soprano's 

1248
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:20,770
is timeless.
Like if the soprano's like if you wanted

1249
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:24,010
to start watching the sopranos today,
it would be a great show.

1250
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:28,690
It's like the Godfather or TV timeless,
but it's better than the Godfather.

1251
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,890
Italians all over the country screaming 
at me.

1252
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:39,580
Shit.
The Godfather is the greatest fucking 

1253
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:39,580
movie.
The Godfather is an amazing movie.

1254
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,940
Don't get me wrong,
but it's limited by its format,

1255
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,010
so limited by the fact that it's a 
movie.

1256
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,940
Even though you get godfather one and 
two sopranos was on for like what?

1257
00:58:48,941 --> 00:58:52,690
Five years,
five years of episodes.

1258
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:57,640
The depth that they can get into all the
crazy shit that they could do it just so

1259
00:58:57,641 --> 00:59:01,480
different than any other movie or than 
any other form of music.

1260
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,570
They could go off and talk about the gay
member author.

1261
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:07,010
Goddamn gang.
Yeah.

1262
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:12,040
Do anything they can do anything.
He's a fair with a psychiatrist or 

1263
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:12,040
anything.
Anything.

1264
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,520
Yeah.
Remember they killed that dude.

1265
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,750
A pool cue showed a pool cue up his ass.
Crazy gay guy.

1266
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:19,600
Yeah.
That that was the whole thing was weird,

1267
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,400
you know,
it was like you're,

1268
00:59:21,401 --> 00:59:26,401
you're getting deep into the lives of 
these strange characters and sociopath 

1269
00:59:26,401 --> 00:59:29,540
and you kind of understand their angst 
because you started rooting for them.

1270
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,510
Yeah,
I could.

1271
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,890
Even in the Americans they're rushing,
but you start rooting for them.

1272
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,410
You don't want to get caught,
you know,

1273
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:41,770
you want them to.
And it's really are from another 

1274
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:41,770
country.
Maybe maybe,

1275
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:46,240
but if you watch it,
watch a few episodes and see if you 

1276
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:46,240
don't like start rooting for the Russian
space is how.

1277
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,870
This is how I picture the show.
Perfect APP.

1278
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,160
You find out five minutes into the show 
that they're Russian spies.

1279
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,170
The FBI kicks the door down.
A bunch of white guys guns blazing,

1280
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:02,410
pointed out them.
They immediately shipped them to 

1281
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:02,410
Guantanamo Bay and then put the House 
for sale,

1282
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,960
for sale and they make a profit off the 
house by house.

1283
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:11,090
I wonder if they did a scan to the spy 
house.

1284
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,040
Find out if they scan the spy house to 
find out what kind of spy shit they got.

1285
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,740
Because you know Russia's not going to 
just let you have a spy house by herself

1286
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:22,340
and you haven't parties and we've 
googled the other day to check in.

1287
01:00:22,341 --> 01:00:27,341
We saw barbecue.
You'll have blurbing you working us by 

1288
01:00:27,341 --> 01:00:29,810
which one?
Which one tends to be turned in American

1289
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,390
easy blurb.
Acute time or spite time.

1290
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,260
You'll get the spine.
Yeah.

1291
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:38,750
So they probably like they gotta be 
spying on the spies for sure.

1292
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,220
Yeah,
I trust them.

1293
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:44,360
Spy just moved to New Jersey.
Have a good time to start doing coke.

1294
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,770
They know you could get turned out for 
sure.

1295
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:50,660
Why wouldn't you get turned over here?
You could do whatever the fuck you want.

1296
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,840
Most people,
most people are not gonna kill you.

1297
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,130
You don't have to,
but then they know you're there,

1298
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:03,370
so they'll send somebody.
You wouldn't even know who the person 

1299
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:03,370
is.
It'd be like some La femme.

1300
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:05,470
Nikita chick comes over your house 
selling vacuums or something.

1301
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,950
You opened the door.
She shoots you in the Dick.

1302
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,280
Right?
Could be.

1303
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:15,320
I just don't understand why they would 
use that strategy.

1304
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:20,210
Like they hire someone to pretend to be 
American flying across the world.

1305
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:24,740
Set them up,
go get information in Montclair.

1306
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:26,510
You got to watch the Americans,
man.

1307
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:27,830
It works.
Yeah.

1308
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,780
What kind of information?
I guess that's my bay.

1309
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,170
Uh,
so spoiled.

1310
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,490
I don't know.
There's this.

1311
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:37,640
So say say there's the FBI.
Okay.

1312
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:43,540
So the husband puts on a disguise and 
starts

1313
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:45,670
dating that.

1314
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:49,750
The secretary of the director of the 
FBI.

1315
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,760
Whoa.
So the husband,

1316
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:54,940
is he a real husband?
They are married,

1317
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,650
right?
They were pair together,

1318
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:58,750
right.
They had two kids together.

1319
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:04,420
Real well,
not in the show and the show in the 

1320
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:04,600
show.
They had two kids together in America.

1321
01:02:04,601 --> 01:02:06,070
They run a travel agency

1322
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,330
and then

1323
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,370
on top of that they're both spies on top
of that.

1324
01:02:10,371 --> 01:02:15,371
They both by.
So the traveling just bang other chicks 

1325
01:02:15,371 --> 01:02:15,371
like baby,
I got it.

1326
01:02:15,371 --> 01:02:16,120
She gets the bang other dudes,
God,

1327
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,200
like,
like if there's a target like it,

1328
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:20,300
if there's a target

1329
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:24,690
that they could get too emotionally,
then they just do what they gotta do.

1330
01:02:24,691 --> 01:02:27,930
And then sometimes they come home and 
he's like,

1331
01:02:27,931 --> 01:02:29,640
did you fuck up?
Whoa.

1332
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,090
And she has to say I did do differ 
Russia.

1333
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,760
Yeah.
I did duty.

1334
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:39,890
And meanwhile the both of them have 
fallen in and out of love and get 

1335
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:39,890
jealous.
Oh my God.

1336
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:44,900
And then sometimes they liked the people
that they have to kill or like good 

1337
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,370
fucking show.
Yeah man,

1338
01:02:47,371 --> 01:02:50,130
it's so intricate.
Dam.

1339
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:55,250
And then one of the,
the neighbor just moved in and he works 

1340
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:58,561
for the FBI.
So then their kids go over to his house 

1341
01:02:58,561 --> 01:03:02,961
and his kids come over to their house 
and he doesn't know that they are 

1342
01:03:02,961 --> 01:03:04,260
Russian spies.
He's had hunches before.

1343
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:05,570
Oh.
So it's just,

1344
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,200
it's a crazy fucking show,
man.

1345
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,040
Damn

1346
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:09,580
good.
As good.

1347
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:15,150
Better or not as good as house of cards.
I say better than a house of cards.

1348
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,660
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.

1349
01:03:19,661 --> 01:03:22,510
I don't even know.
Now I know you are a foreigner.

1350
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:28,230
You are some kind of a.
An agent yourself told you I was a 

1351
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,230
foreign.
Yeah,

1352
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:30,240
but now I know I'm American foreign as 
he pours his teeth.

1353
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,090
Jesus Christ.
Fuck,

1354
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,540
are you?
Everything's a crime.

1355
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,110
Before,
who are you?

1356
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,870
You don't even drink coffee.
You barely American,

1357
01:03:40,871 --> 01:03:42,060
Bro.
I know.

1358
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,600
I know you.
You love.

1359
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,290
You have the full foreign package.
Man.

1360
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:48,730
You're into soccer?
Yeah.

1361
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:49,720
Yeah.
Do you have a call?

1362
01:03:49,721 --> 01:03:50,590
Soccer,
football and.

1363
01:03:50,591 --> 01:03:52,510
No.
No Americans around.

1364
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:54,900
Uh,
do you,

1365
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:57,040
do you like it when they are around?
Sometimes.

1366
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:02,090
Do you really?
But I just say soccer just so people 

1367
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:02,090
know what I'm talking about.
Right?

1368
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:02,320
Yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

1369
01:04:02,321 --> 01:04:04,660
You'd probably say football when you're 
around other people.

1370
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:05,940
Yeah.
If I'm talking to somebody from,

1371
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:07,900
sometimes I'm talking to a friend

1372
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,340
from England and I'll say soccer,
then they'll get mad at you.

1373
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:12,050
Now

1374
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:15,340
some people have disappointed though 
they'll correct it.

1375
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,350
Uh,
but it won't,

1376
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,650
it won't be a sticking point in the 
conversation.

1377
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,420
It's a sticking point in America.
Right.

1378
01:04:22,421 --> 01:04:23,980
So you just stick with soccer?
Yeah.

1379
01:04:23,981 --> 01:04:25,510
Yeah.
You've never said football to me,

1380
01:04:25,511 --> 01:04:30,511
but I always suspected it was packed and
I knew something was going on this 

1381
01:04:30,511 --> 01:04:34,890
motherfucker so into that game.
I know he uses the proper terminology 

1382
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:41,310
when I'm not around.
Yeah.

1383
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,380
Like someone will say you want to play 
billiards and I'll let it slide.

1384
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:44,780
Like,
okay.

1385
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,590
And that's cool,
right?

1386
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,560
Yeah.
Not really.

1387
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:52,000
Not really.
Pocket and pool billiards is a game that

1388
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:53,200
you play with.
No,

1389
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,870
there's no holes in the table.
They received that game.

1390
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:56,740
I think so.
There's like,

1391
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:01,980
there's like things in the table now.
There's others in Italian version of it 

1392
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:02,980
where they play.
They have these little pins.

1393
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:08,190
You're thinking a bumper pool.
I think three cushioned billiards is a 

1394
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:11,620
very strange game where and that used to
be the premier game by the way back,

1395
01:05:11,621 --> 01:05:14,140
like in the willy hoppy days,
like way,

1396
01:05:14,141 --> 01:05:16,000
way,
way back in the,

1397
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,070
I guess probably the turn of the 
century,

1398
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:23,100
the turn of the 20th century.
They had thousands of pool halls and 

1399
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:28,921
billiard halls in New York City,
but pool halls like where there's a hole

1400
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:31,060
in the table and the boss to fall into 
the hole.

1401
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:34,240
Those were thought to be the,
that's the game of.

1402
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,740
And like dirt bags,
gentlemen played billiards.

1403
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:43,950
They played three cushioned billiards 
and that was actually a part of the 

1404
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:47,701
scene in the movie,
the Hustler with Paul Newman and Jackie 

1405
01:05:47,701 --> 01:05:49,090
gleason.
Paul Newman goes over this dude's house.

1406
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,770
Uh,
I forget the gentleman's name,

1407
01:05:50,771 --> 01:05:52,450
but he's a very famous actors.
Great.

1408
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,070
Great scene.
And He,

1409
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:59,180
they're supposed to gamble because this 
guy's a big fish and he has this big 

1410
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:02,311
mansion and Paul Newman is this hustler.
He goes over the guy's mansion and the 

1411
01:06:02,311 --> 01:06:03,640
guy doesn't have a pool table.
He has a billiards table.

1412
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:05,010
And the,
uh,

1413
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:08,680
the,
the mob guy who's backing Paul Newman on

1414
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:11,110
the bet doesn't believe that he could 
beat this guy.

1415
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:16,980
And so they have to figure out like what
to do because it's totally different 

1416
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:17,470
game.
But it was the game of gentlemen.

1417
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:22,860
Three cushioned billiards is a game 
where it's you have to hit a ball and 

1418
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:26,611
then your ball has to go three cushions.
That means bounced into three rails and 

1419
01:06:26,611 --> 01:06:30,010
then come back and hit the ball.
It's really crazy.

1420
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:30,790
It's a,
it's a,

1421
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:33,910
it's an interesting game because it's 
all about angles you ever played.

1422
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:34,990
Yeah,
I played it,

1423
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:36,640
but it's,
it's hard to do.

1424
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,880
You have to really understand.
There's a lot of factors that come into 

1425
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,030
play.
Here it is right here.

1426
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:48,130
This is the actual game.
You can do shit like that when you play 

1427
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:48,130
pool.
Yeah.

1428
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:48,850
No,
I do.

1429
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:51,250
I mean I,
I definitely moved the ball around and I

1430
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:54,600
understand some angles,
but like this stuff like what this guy's

1431
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,300
doing right here,
this,

1432
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,700
this is like super complicated stuff to 
be able to help you win this thing.

1433
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:04,030
You just get a point every time you get 
three cushions,

1434
01:07:04,031 --> 01:07:06,390
like see how he's doing this right here,
he's doing that.

1435
01:07:06,391 --> 01:07:08,440
It bounced off the railroad,
hits that and then it's going to hit the

1436
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,710
other one.
Like doing stuff like that on purpose.

1437
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:16,770
I mean they're doing it on purpose is 
very difficult to do like you to to 

1438
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:21,781
really understand how.
I mean sometimes you're going four and 

1439
01:07:21,781 --> 01:07:25,381
five and even six rails to make 
something do what you wanted to do 

1440
01:07:25,381 --> 01:07:29,161
because it was the only option you had 
with the position of the ball on the 

1441
01:07:29,161 --> 01:07:29,890
table relative to the position of the 
ball you're trying to hit.

1442
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:34,190
If you have to go three rails,
so you see like these crazy tricky shots

1443
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,820
these guys do where they're calculating 
the ball,

1444
01:07:36,821 --> 01:07:41,821
going three rails,
hitting another ball and then going to 

1445
01:07:41,821 --> 01:07:41,821
rails and then hitting a third ball.

1446
01:07:41,821 --> 01:07:43,390
It's like crazy.
It's like the way they do it is amazing.

1447
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,950
It's really amazing how many balls are 
in the table that he's three balls.

1448
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,880
Three balls.
Yeah.

1449
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:51,280
It's really,
it's fascinating.

1450
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:55,420
I never got into it because I would 
imagine that it would become addictive,

1451
01:07:55,421 --> 01:07:57,970
just like pools addictive and I don't 
have the time.

1452
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,660
I just can't be fucking with some new 
thing to get addicted to it.

1453
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,170
Especially when you're going to start,
you know,

1454
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:06,190
checking out some soccer I feel.
Yeah.

1455
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,770
Isn't that weird though?
How they do this?

1456
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:12,040
See he's going to hit that and it's 
going to bounce up and hit the other one

1457
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:15,010
and they are planning this out.
That's what's interesting.

1458
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:20,290
And the guys who are real good at it,
a lot of times it translates very good 

1459
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:21,800
into pool too.
It seems like it would.

1460
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:27,050
Yeah.
Well they figure out how to move the 

1461
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:27,050
ball better than other people.

1462
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:31,220
Like there's a guy named Aaron Ray is 
and he's widely considered to be 

1463
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:35,051
probably the best pool player of all 
time and he plays this game really good.

1464
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,630
He plays this game really good.
Any place.

1465
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:44,110
Another game that the Filipinos like to 
play called rotation and rotation is a 

1466
01:08:44,631 --> 01:08:48,530
game like you know how you play nine 
ball and shoot one through nine.

1467
01:08:48,531 --> 01:08:50,600
You got to shoot the balls in order 
rotation.

1468
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:52,730
They do that with 15 balls.
What?

1469
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:57,870
Yeah.
Filipinos are some of the best players 

1470
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:59,720
in the world and it's interesting 
because the the game of billiards,

1471
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:04,810
pocket billiards,
I should say I guess regular billiards 

1472
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:07,510
to got brought to them during World War 
II when they had a American.

1473
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:12,810
Gis would be in the Philippines 
apparently during the war when people 

1474
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:18,191
would go over there,
they would set up pool tables and Gis 

1475
01:09:18,191 --> 01:09:21,240
would go to bars and they figured out 
how to play pool and it became a great 

1476
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,610
thing for the Filipinos who love 
gambling,

1477
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:27,930
love gambling,
so they would just play pool and gamble 

1478
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:27,930
all the time.

1479
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,780
So some of the best players in the world
have come out of the Philippines.

1480
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,600
Manila has some of the best players 
ever,

1481
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:38,050
like,
like the top guys like that guy effort 

1482
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:38,050
and ray is.
He's from the Philippines.

1483
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:41,410
Francisco boosted monitoring where the 
best of all time he's from the 

1484
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:44,111
Philippines.
There's like you keep going on and on 

1485
01:09:44,111 --> 01:09:44,111
and on and on and on.
There's A.

1486
01:09:44,111 --> 01:09:46,490
There's a whole gang of these dudes,
little tiny killers,

1487
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:48,680
so I never played pool against the 
Filipino.

1488
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,710
That's what I'm learning there.
Real quiet,

1489
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,270
real friendly.
They'll smash you.

1490
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,760
Yeah.
Some of the best players in the world.

1491
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:58,650
It's just a huge sport over there as 
Jay.

1492
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,470
It's on television all the time.
Over there.

1493
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:06,040
Pool is like the first video game 
because because it's,

1494
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:11,980
it's a pool and just a table and you go 
into a bar and it's there.

1495
01:10:12,471 --> 01:10:17,471
You put money in there and you start 
playing it before they were graphics or 

1496
01:10:17,471 --> 01:10:19,550
programs or anything.
It's just,

1497
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:24,640
it's just a game.
It's like the first game you can play 

1498
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,030
without before video games.
You know what I mean?

1499
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,120
I know what you're saying.
Yeah.

1500
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:30,420
It was like an arcade game.
Like dark.

1501
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:32,290
Yeah,
and darks here.

1502
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:36,310
They would play I think.
I think they started calling it pool.

1503
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,310
I know actually they started calling it 
pool because it was a gambling thing.

1504
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,430
The thing that they would pool their 
money together,

1505
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,090
bed on stuff and that's how,
uh,

1506
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:48,220
that's how pool got its bad name versus 
billiards,

1507
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:51,340
but like darts,
they must bet on dark.

1508
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,660
That's right.
And people would bid on dots.

1509
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:54,960
Yeah.
Dots is a big sport in England.

1510
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:56,280
Huge.
It's on TV.

1511
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:56,460
I

1512
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,470
saw it on TV.
I saw snicker,

1513
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,720
snicker,
snicker.

1514
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:04,680
They call it sneaker is pool or 
something else.

1515
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,750
Sneakers.
A totally different game.

1516
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,510
And it's on a giant table.
Yeah.

1517
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:13,860
The a pool.
A pool table is nine by and a half,

1518
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,110
which means four and a half foot wide,
nine foot long.

1519
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:19,410
That's a real legit pool table.
There's also 10 by fives.

1520
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:24,650
Ten by five.
Pool tables are just starting to make a 

1521
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:25,470
comeback as a company called diamond and
they make a 10 by five.

1522
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:30,360
Now it's a big deal because the real 
high end players like the extra space at

1523
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:35,400
the 10 by five,
they think it makes you play a better 

1524
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:35,400
game.
But snookers 12 feet.

1525
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,230
Jesus.
Yeah.

1526
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,270
It's 12 by six.
So giant fucking table.

1527
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:43,440
And these dudes have a tiny little ball.
It's a tiny ass little ball.

1528
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:47,610
It's way smaller than a pool ball and 
the holes are really tiny and the cut of

1529
01:11:47,611 --> 01:11:48,930
the rails is very different.

1530
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:52,470
Like you can kind of rattle a ball into 
a pool table hole.

1531
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:57,680
It'll kind of drop in,
but you have to hit like this is a 

1532
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,680
snooker table size of this fucking 
table.

1533
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:03,360
Now this is Ronnie.
Oh Sullivan who's one of the greatest of

1534
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:08,361
all time and he's a fucking wizard and 
this is the greatest game of snooker 

1535
01:12:08,361 --> 01:12:09,160
ever.
It's because he just.

1536
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:13,320
He does everything perfect and he shoots
his whole rack perfect.

1537
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:18,650
But snickers a totally different game.
Like see how the sneaker rather that 

1538
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:22,521
goes in there.
A sneaker that he shot the ball in and 

1539
01:12:22,521 --> 01:12:22,650
then the ball comes back up again.
It comes back up.

1540
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:23,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

1541
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,580
The black ball.
Oh,

1542
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,760
every time he shoots the black that has 
no scratching.

1543
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:28,110
I don't know.
You can scratch.

1544
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,940
I did don't.
I don't know the game.

1545
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I don't understand the game,
but there's a bunch of points and all 

1546
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:35,010
these different things that you're 
doing,

1547
01:12:35,011 --> 01:12:39,000
but see how he knocks that a black ball 
in after the black ball goes in,

1548
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:42,450
the guy pulls it out and he puts it back
in the spot and then he has to shoot one

1549
01:12:42,451 --> 01:12:44,640
of the reds again and then after he 
shoots the red,

1550
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,760
then he goes and shoots the black again 
and every time he's doing it see that 

1551
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:49,760
stack of balls.

1552
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:54,250
He's trying to collide into those balls 
to open them up and if he can open them 

1553
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:58,101
up,
then he can get it to a place where he 

1554
01:12:58,101 --> 01:12:58,350
can separate those balls and make them 
all.

1555
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:03,380
So Watch.
He's going to make this red ball and 

1556
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,571
then he's going to pound up.
Now he see on an angle would that black 

1557
01:13:05,571 --> 01:13:06,240
ball.
So as he shoot that black ball in,

1558
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:09,300
he's going to smack into those other 
balls being see that.

1559
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,730
Alright,
see now again,

1560
01:13:11,731 --> 01:13:15,750
I don't know this game very well,
but I understand pool so I see what he's

1561
01:13:15,751 --> 01:13:17,610
doing with those balls.
I knew he was going to do that,

1562
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:20,370
so now he's just going to pocket these 
balls in the side,

1563
01:13:20,371 --> 01:13:25,371
but you're dealing with the tiniest 
little fucking hole and they have tiny 

1564
01:13:25,371 --> 01:13:28,230
little tips on their pool cues.
It's sort of like a pool cue,

1565
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:29,130
but it's all.

1566
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,350
They're all made of ash,
which is very different than.

1567
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,030
Yeah,
Ashwood.

1568
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:38,210
Whereas I'm most American pool cues that
at least the shafts are made out of 

1569
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:43,131
maple.
Like there's a lot of weird variables 

1570
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:43,410
like ash is very stiff but also very 
light,

1571
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:47,160
so their game is very different,
but he's also very similar.

1572
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,080
He's also thinking very fast,
oh,

1573
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:51,600
he's a wizard.
This guy's a super genius,

1574
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:54,630
but like I wouldn't have taken my second
shot yet.

1575
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:57,480
I know he's like clearing the table.
He's doing this every day.

1576
01:13:57,481 --> 01:13:59,910
You don't realize,
but you gotta think he's also.

1577
01:13:59,911 --> 01:14:02,490
I'm extremely wealthy because of this 
game.

1578
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:07,760
This is not a game like American pool.
This is a game like more akin to like 

1579
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,120
golf in terms of like purses and how 
much money these guys can make it.

1580
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:14,380
At least it was at one point in time.
I think somehow or another it's dried up

1581
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:19,780
a think like snuckered doesn't,
doesn't have the same respect that it 

1582
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:19,780
used to have.

1583
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:23,560
There's been also a few controversies in
England or guys got busted,

1584
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:25,660
uh,
talking to people about fixing games.

1585
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:28,240
Oh yeah.
That gets ugly.

1586
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:31,060
That old man is like the ball boy in 
tennis.

1587
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:36,230
Exactly.
Grabbing the ball at the hole and 

1588
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:36,230
putting it on the table.
But he does it with gloves on,

1589
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:38,140
like a gentleman that actually the 
gloves have a purpose.

1590
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:43,510
The gloves are so your hand oils don't 
get on the ball because the balls are 

1591
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:46,340
made out of what's called phenolic.
It's like a type of thing.

1592
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:48,580
It's like a composite plastic.
Um,

1593
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:53,850
and they're super hard.
Like if you touch those balls that are 

1594
01:14:53,850 --> 01:14:56,251
out there on that table and they're like
super hard and they used to make them 

1595
01:14:56,251 --> 01:14:59,290
with either clay or ivory back then way 
back in the day.

1596
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,310
Yeah.
They,

1597
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,470
a lot of times they made the cue ball 
with ivory and then the other balls it'd

1598
01:15:04,471 --> 01:15:08,170
be made out of clay or sometimes the 
whole everything would be made at clay.

1599
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:11,590
But they were like these dead balls that
were really tough to move around.

1600
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:13,780
And then when they figured out this 
phenolic stuff,

1601
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:16,690
you're dealing with these things.
It gets super slick.

1602
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:21,070
So the greases from your hands,
if you touch a ball,

1603
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:26,280
the oils on your hands will actually put
a residue on the ball and it'll affect 

1604
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,090
the way the ball moves.
So the game off.

1605
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:33,240
Yeah.
So if you see dudes touching cue balls 

1606
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,641
and balls and you're playing pool,
like anybody who really knows how to 

1607
01:15:35,641 --> 01:15:35,890
play is going to go,
that's going to fuck everything up.

1608
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:37,450
Put your gloves on.
Yeah.

1609
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:40,840
Or put a towel on and wipe them down.
Something like serious games.

1610
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,790
They'll wipe every ball down after every
rack in regular pool.

1611
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:46,870
Yeah.
Like guys,

1612
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:51,900
guys that are gambling,
they want that ball to respond a very 

1613
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,290
particular way.
Like because you get this,

1614
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,480
when you think about what pool it's 
right,

1615
01:15:55,810 --> 01:16:00,810
you're taking a acute,
the average weight of accused about 19 

1616
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:00,810
ounces.

1617
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:04,770
So it's a very light thing.
So a little over a pound and you're 

1618
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:05,560
taking this thing and just by how hard 
you're hitting,

1619
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:10,710
you're trying to control the revolutions
of a ball and also those revolutions 

1620
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:16,000
after it collides with a ball and knocks
it into a hole and then you're trying to

1621
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:21,510
control the revolutions still like 
literally within inches and you get a 

1622
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:24,280
feel after you do it for awhile and you 
play for hours and hours,

1623
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:25,930
especially after years and years of 
playing.

1624
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:31,230
You get this field where like the guy 
like that guy effort and ray as I was 

1625
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:31,450
talking about,
he could just put that ball wherever the

1626
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:33,910
fuck he wants it.
He goes wherever he wants it,

1627
01:16:33,911 --> 01:16:37,760
he makes a ball ball goes where it goes 
for every once it was like,

1628
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:40,390
can you watch him play?
It's like you're watching an art form.

1629
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:45,690
Like it's.
If you know how hard it is to play that 

1630
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:46,210
guy plays.
I know I suck so bad.

1631
01:16:46,211 --> 01:16:47,560
I know it's hard to play.
See,

1632
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:52,561
the thing about sucking so bad though is
maybe you don't even appreciate how 

1633
01:16:52,561 --> 01:16:52,600
crazy it is.
What he's doing.

1634
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,450
I could play a little bit.
Then you watch him,

1635
01:16:55,451 --> 01:16:58,270
you just go God,
like the people that really appreciate a

1636
01:16:58,271 --> 01:17:01,880
guy like effort and Razz or earl 
strickland for that matter and he.

1637
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:04,780
He's like world champion players.
The people will really appreciate him.

1638
01:17:04,781 --> 01:17:08,560
Are People that have played for awhile.
You know how you said you don't have the

1639
01:17:08,561 --> 01:17:10,020
time to learn billy?
It's.

1640
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:15,100
Yeah.
It's like I up the Times I play pool or 

1641
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,160
you play against somebody good or you 
watch somebody play.

1642
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,900
You're like,
yeah,

1643
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,440
that takes a lot of practice.
I don't have the time to get that good.

1644
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:22,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

1645
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:24,710
There's only so many hours in the day,
man.

1646
01:17:24,711 --> 01:17:26,300
Yeah.
You want to play golf?

1647
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:28,590
Go play golf.
You crazy.

1648
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,250
If you want to start golf today,
you must.

1649
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:33,980
You must have like just extra time 
coming out of your ass.

1650
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,110
Right?
That's like a nine hour commitment.

1651
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:38,330
Yeah.
You got to join a country club.

1652
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:43,570
I know a dude who just joined a country 
club that costs a quarter of a million 

1653
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:45,020
dollars a year.
How is he going?

1654
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:50,230
That's what I'm saying.
What it costs a quarter of a million 

1655
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:55,630
dollars a year,
it costs that and then you have to pay 

1656
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:58,100
it on you when you go.
I'm sure there you have to get equipment

1657
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:59,870
unless everything's free.

1658
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,210
Other than that,
you just go there and it's all free,

1659
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:04,490
but that doesn't make sense.
I'm gonna open up a country club.

1660
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,560
I think they just.
It's what we're talking about.

1661
01:18:06,561 --> 01:18:08,280
Like the billionaire ballers,
right?

1662
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:11,180
If you're a billionaire bar,
quarter million bucks ain't shit.

1663
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:12,530
It's like if someone says,
Hey Ian,

1664
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:15,680
we want you to join the comedians unions
$25 a year and you're like,

1665
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,480
what's 25 bucks?
Right?

1666
01:18:17,481 --> 01:18:18,140
Yeah.
Here you go.

1667
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,450
Twenty five bucks.
And if you're a super baller,

1668
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,340
$250,000
a year,

1669
01:18:22,341 --> 01:18:27,341
it's like you go into,
you're going to run into other 

1670
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:30,440
billionaires,
you're going to do business and you 

1671
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:30,440
gotta make that money back.
That's what I'm saying.

1672
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,790
It's worth it.
And business models and you can write it

1673
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,970
insulated because everybody there is a 
baller,

1674
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,900
right?
Right.

1675
01:18:35,901 --> 01:18:38,540
You're only around.
People can afford a $250,000

1676
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:41,900
a year membership shit hole,
and the people that work there,

1677
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,520
they just want to keep their job.

1678
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:45,320
They probably just probably pays good,
so they're just,

1679
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:46,220
hey,
what do you.

1680
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:47,870
What do you want?
Here's a,

1681
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,550
here's your order.
Leave you alone.

1682
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:55,060
You know what?
I don't get people that want to live on 

1683
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:55,060
golf courses that don't play golf.
Oh,

1684
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:55,220
for real?
Yeah.

1685
01:18:55,221 --> 01:18:55,730
Like,
hold on.

1686
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,190
You don't play golf and you want to live
on a golf course.

1687
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:03,330
It does look beautiful.
It does look beautiful until some drunk 

1688
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:03,560
assholes or playing golf or outside your
bedroom.

1689
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:06,620
There are people that live on golf 
courses.

1690
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:08,240
Oh yeah,
dude.

1691
01:19:08,241 --> 01:19:13,241
Everywhere.
There's a lot of these places are like 

1692
01:19:13,241 --> 01:19:13,490
gated communities that are on golf 
courses.

1693
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:16,520
It's super common.
It's like the ultimate.

1694
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:20,570
I'm a baller statement.
You have a gated community that's a golf

1695
01:19:20,571 --> 01:19:23,390
course and you're a member of it.
This is a place out here.

1696
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,690
It's called Lake Sherwood Lake Sherwood 
Country Club.

1697
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:29,780
It's amazing.
You go to these beautiful houses.

1698
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:34,780
It's amazing golf course.
Just everyone's solaris and it's a.

1699
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:39,290
They actually have their own lake,
there's a lake out there,

1700
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:43,630
you can go bass fishing in it.
They have like large mouth bass and this

1701
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,050
lake.
Yeah.

1702
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:50,051
And it's um,
it's a beautiful community and these 

1703
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:51,110
people have these houses that are like 
on a golf course.

1704
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:56,250
If it costs just a quarter of a mil to 
be a part of a golf club,

1705
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:59,390
how much does it cost?
I have a house,

1706
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:03,080
probably the place you live in urban and
I'm out on the golf course.

1707
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:05,210
Millions.
Millions dollars for sure.

1708
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:08,010
I mean it's a wealthy community,
but

1709
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:11,790
I think that's when you get those sort 
of CEO dudes,

1710
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:16,970
they start moving into that upper 
echelon of finance and cash.

1711
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:22,670
They uh,
they don't want to be surrounded by 

1712
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:24,441
people just like them and just kinda.
It's like us wanting to be around other 

1713
01:20:24,441 --> 01:20:24,441
comedians.
Yeah.

1714
01:20:24,441 --> 01:20:25,770
Because I don't have any civilian 
friends.

1715
01:20:25,771 --> 01:20:28,240
Really.
All comedians right now.

1716
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,740
I've been in it so long,
like not funny.

1717
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:33,900
We call it civilians will get mad at 
that by the way.

1718
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,780
They are they.
But people get mad at it like that.

1719
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:41,781
You used military terms.
Sorry.

1720
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:46,050
That's funny thing,
that term,

1721
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:48,750
as soon as you say to a comic,
they know what it is,

1722
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:52,340
even if you've never used it around with
them before and he get it right.

1723
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:54,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

1724
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,820
They don't understand true debauchery.
Yeah.

1725
01:20:57,050 --> 01:21:02,050
Like you think you get it.
You need to hang out with atheist 

1726
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:02,050
already.

1727
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:02,050
Should fear.
Yeah.

1728
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:04,920
In Amsterdam for a week.
What the fuck is really going on?

1729
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:07,910
Yeah,
like when like if I'm a from around like

1730
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:11,070
a friend from high school and I say 
something,

1731
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:14,570
even if the person that they just 
introduced me to laugh,

1732
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:16,980
they said y'all got to excuse him.
He's a comedian.

1733
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:20,340
Like none of my comedian friends would 
ever say no shit like that.

1734
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:26,090
Like try to like make an excuse for 
something that they feel uncomfortable 

1735
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:26,670
about that.
I said,

1736
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:31,850
you know what that comes from where 
human resources that comes from like 

1737
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:33,270
office rules,
keep that job.

1738
01:21:33,271 --> 01:21:36,810
You gotta keep your behavior in check.
You can't be yourself.

1739
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,490
I mean how many people just live out 
there under a vice?

1740
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:45,690
Just a vice of repression,
right?

1741
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:48,870
Can't laugh around Kent joke around 
about shit.

1742
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:51,570
Yeah.
And I take that for granted because what

1743
01:21:51,571 --> 01:21:52,740
I do,
I can say whatever I want.

1744
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:57,740
Sometimes I think I'm not saying enough 
based on the other people that are 

1745
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:58,680
saying shit to me.
Yeah.

1746
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:04,040
I mean,
imagine if you're in an office with 50 

1747
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:04,890
people and you hate 10 of them and one 
of them's your boss,

1748
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,630
right?
Oh.

1749
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:11,960
And there's a bunch of attention seeking
dipshits in the staff taking credit for 

1750
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,320
other people's work.
You can't say anything.

1751
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:15,460
Oh,
oh,

1752
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:21,950
your wife or your husband or whatever.
So many people live in hell.

1753
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:27,380
How many people live in hell?
Like that just stuck all day with 

1754
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:32,121
dipshits saying dumb things.
But that's why people listen to your 

1755
01:22:32,121 --> 01:22:34,560
podcast.
Like it's there.

1756
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:37,170
It's like when you watch a,
like somebody on tv,

1757
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:42,180
you watch a James Bond movie and he's 
doing things that you can't do,

1758
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:48,020
like just having a podcast where you say
whatever the fuck you want and just 

1759
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:53,301
living like people live in the office,
you get to live through you.

1760
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,470
You know what I mean?
Through your podcast.

1761
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:59,240
It's a lot of pressure.
I just keep doing what you're doing sort

1762
01:22:59,241 --> 01:23:00,960
of pressure.
I feel pressure.

1763
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:04,560
You got to be careful.
All that pressure.

1764
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,580
Yeah.
That's why,

1765
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:10,180
you know,
that's why it may be partly why trump is

1766
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:15,181
so popular because he's the first 
president to just talk shit like it's 

1767
01:23:16,181 --> 01:23:20,520
truly a powerful thing.
Like when you build a powerful man,

1768
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,480
most powerful man in the world are 
censored,

1769
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:26,920
but this is the first uncensored,
most powerful man in the world.

1770
01:23:26,921 --> 01:23:31,921
He's truly exuding his power on a don't 
give a fuck level,

1771
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:35,830
but he knows a little bit of a fuck,
but not enough of a change.

1772
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,070
Yeah.
He only gives a fuck if he gets dinged a

1773
01:23:39,071 --> 01:23:39,820
little bit,
but he's.

1774
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:41,260
He not.
He doesn't pull back.

1775
01:23:41,261 --> 01:23:44,020
He just,
he swats back defensively.

1776
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:49,070
Yeah.
In a way that a listener would want to 

1777
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:49,070
swap back defensively at work.

1778
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:51,790
Yeah,
but still can because they.

1779
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:56,590
Trump seems so less worried about his 
job and more like,

1780
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:01,180
I'm just going to be me and that's when 
Chappelle quit the Chappelle show.

1781
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:04,000
Like a lot of people found freedom in 
that.

1782
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:06,400
That's why he's so mythical.
Oh,

1783
01:24:06,401 --> 01:24:07,270
for sure.
Yeah,

1784
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,160
yeah,
yeah.

1785
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,960
Good point.
A lot of people make $50,000,000,

1786
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:14,400
but how many people you know,
turn down $50,

1787
01:24:14,401 --> 01:24:16,480
million dollars.
There's fewer of those.

1788
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:17,780
Yeah.
You know,

1789
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:19,270
just one.
Just one.

1790
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:25,320
Yeah.
And he also didn't do standup in any 

1791
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,460
scheduled performance for years.
He just would show up places.

1792
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:28,480
Yeah.
And he still does that.

1793
01:24:28,481 --> 01:24:29,910
He's like,
so he just uses to.

1794
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,060
Oh,
I'm gonna show up this place.

1795
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:36,200
Yeah.
And then they put out an email or 

1796
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:36,820
however he just shows me about when I 
was in Denver.

1797
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:37,710
Oh Yeah?
Yeah.

1798
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:38,730
Showed up.
Yeah.

1799
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:39,750
I go to the greenroom.

1800
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:40,450
Dave's in there.
I go,

1801
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:41,170
what are you doing,
man?

1802
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:42,700
Hey,
Joe Rogan.

1803
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:44,230
Yeah,
he,

1804
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:47,470
that's his way I guess,
of just being free.

1805
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:47,930
Free.
Yeah.

1806
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:48,680
Do it.
Whatever it was.

1807
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:53,790
The only thing that he has scheduled is 
the radio city thing and that's because 

1808
01:24:53,790 --> 01:24:55,300
I guess it's radio city.
You have to schedule.

1809
01:24:55,301 --> 01:24:57,310
What does he do?
He does a regular show there.

1810
01:24:57,370 --> 01:24:59,110
He's going to do.
He did it a few years ago.

1811
01:24:59,111 --> 01:25:04,111
Now he's going to do like maybe a week 
and a half or two weeks of shows there 

1812
01:25:04,111 --> 01:25:04,900
and he's going to guess on it like 
musical guests,

1813
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:09,850
comics some days like as that's amazing.
And I have a comics ball party.

1814
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:10,940
That's a great idea.
Yeah,

1815
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:13,150
that's a great idea.
Wow.

1816
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:14,720
Yeah.
I mean he,

1817
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,880
he does represent what we all considered
to be like the highest standard of a 

1818
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,870
real comic artists.
You know,

1819
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:22,840
when uh,
when uh,

1820
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:27,990
you get together with a group of 
Comedians and you look at like who's 

1821
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,140
doing it the right way.

1822
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:34,650
I mean there's other ways to do it that 
are really like more commercially 

1823
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:35,500
successful.
Louis is more commercially successful in

1824
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:37,120
terms of like constantly chasing it 
down,

1825
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:41,530
but David's just also has that mythical 
quality to it as well.

1826
01:25:41,531 --> 01:25:43,660
Like you're talking about turning down 
the $50 million.

1827
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:46,990
That has a big factor in how we look at 
it too.

1828
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:50,380
That's his biggest TV credit.
It's turning down and John.

1829
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:55,470
Yeah,
and also like walking away from the 

1830
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:55,470
greatest sketch show the world's ever 
known.

1831
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:57,310
That is still,
to me in my eyes,

1832
01:25:57,311 --> 01:25:59,860
the greatest sketch show of all time.
They had a lot of funny.

1833
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,090
That shit on there.
Oh,

1834
01:26:01,091 --> 01:26:04,040
as far as like hit or miss.
It's the best ever.

1835
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:09,380
Like you can't compare like Saturday 
night live has some great sketches but 

1836
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:11,270
there's a lot of turds in there too.
Mostly turns.

1837
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:14,330
Yeah.
Just over the accumulation of years.

1838
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,930
You've got a lot of bullshit and it's 
also because of the format.

1839
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:20,270
I mean they're trying to come up with a 
new show every week.

1840
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,290
It's brutal.
It's,

1841
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,660
you know,
it's also like,

1842
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:27,800
like when I was talking to Phil Hartman 
when he had just come from Saturday 

1843
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:31,601
night live and he was on news radio.
He was talking about how competitive it 

1844
01:26:31,601 --> 01:26:35,771
is,
their back stabby in fighting and all 

1845
01:26:35,771 --> 01:26:37,590
this and everyone's fighting to get 
their stuff on the earlier do.

1846
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:38,990
I was like,
I don't.

1847
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:42,980
And they don't care if it's the best or 
funny like rack of backstab.

1848
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:44,840
Someone with a good sketch to get my 
okay.

1849
01:26:44,841 --> 01:26:45,840
Sketch on.
So I get some,

1850
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,720
some time,
some shine.

1851
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:48,800
Fuck it.
That's.

1852
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:49,580
Well,
listen,

1853
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:52,580
if you look at all the people that have 
been on Saturday night live,

1854
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:54,110
right,
how many of them?

1855
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:55,970
You're like,
that guy was on site live.

1856
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:58,670
There's a lot.
There's a lot.

1857
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:00,770
There's a lot of Saturday night live 
used to be.

1858
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,810
Holy Shit,
it's Dan Akroyd.

1859
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:05,960
It's Gilda radner.
It's John Belushi.

1860
01:27:05,961 --> 01:27:08,240
It was people that were just chevy 
chase.

1861
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:11,150
People that were giant because they were
on Saturday night live.

1862
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:14,030
If you were onsite live,
you fucking made it.

1863
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:19,190
Now it's maybe what?
One out of 10 that you even know who the

1864
01:27:19,191 --> 01:27:22,970
fuck they are after they leave.
There's a lot of exercise.

1865
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:25,550
A lot of people.
How about Darrell Hammond?

1866
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:30,260
Darrell Hammond was on Sinai live for a 
long fucking time,

1867
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,340
but if you come up to the average person
say,

1868
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:35,540
and he's a funny comment.
Do you remember Darrell from New York?

1869
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:39,170
I remember there was a funny guy,
man before Saturday night live,

1870
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:43,190
but it didn't translate into like big 
movies are a lot of stuff.

1871
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:46,640
You know?
That guy was really good.

1872
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:50,090
I mean he was into really good sketches.
Tim Meadows,

1873
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,350
whatever happened to Tim Meadows.

1874
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:56,850
He's the one standup and it gets jobs,
but he's not big like he was when he's 

1875
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:57,700
on snl time.
Right.

1876
01:27:57,701 --> 01:28:02,701
I know there was a time when him and 
pharaoh would kind of like neck and 

1877
01:28:02,701 --> 01:28:05,641
neck,
like they both leave snl and what 

1878
01:28:05,641 --> 01:28:07,270
happened here?
Like a couple of duds?

1879
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:09,130
Yeah.
Was that one called?

1880
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:10,240
Oh,
movie who was in?

1881
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:11,980
Oh yeah,
ladies,

1882
01:28:11,981 --> 01:28:12,610
man.
Ladies.

1883
01:28:12,611 --> 01:28:14,000
Man killed it.
Yeah,

1884
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:18,700
like that was like a record deal.
It's like when you get out,

1885
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:23,170
you drop your first album and if it 
doesn't hit to rap,

1886
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,070
rap,
show business,

1887
01:28:24,071 --> 01:28:25,210
be stone cold.

1888
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:29,560
Look at a man,
ladies.

1889
01:28:29,561 --> 01:28:34,561
Man.
He was funny in this movie too and that 

1890
01:28:34,561 --> 01:28:34,561
was his character on snl.
Right?

1891
01:28:34,561 --> 01:28:37,480
Which means it's not even his movie.
Like Lauren gets the.

1892
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:42,340
He gets all the movies,
like you created a character on snl.

1893
01:28:42,341 --> 01:28:43,180
It's like,
oh bitch,

1894
01:28:43,181 --> 01:28:48,181
that's my movie.
Like you can't just do it on your own 

1895
01:28:48,181 --> 01:28:48,730
and then you cut loose and then it's 
like,

1896
01:28:48,731 --> 01:28:51,760
well good luck.
I mean how many of them are there?

1897
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:52,520
How many,
how many,

1898
01:28:52,521 --> 01:28:57,521
like really successful comedians have 
come from sm snl versus how many have 

1899
01:28:57,971 --> 01:29:00,730
been on probably crazy numbers,
right?

1900
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:02,160
Yeah.
Here's the list of

1901
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,770
a lot.
Almost everyone that's ever been on it.

1902
01:29:04,771 --> 01:29:08,430
I think it's a lot of people don't even 
keep scrolling.

1903
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:09,040
Oh,
well,

1904
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:11,740
there's probably hundreds of people 
forever.

1905
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:17,800
He's doing stand up now.
I forgot Al Franken was on it.

1906
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:18,820
Oh Shit.
Yeah,

1907
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:20,950
he's a.
he's a senator now.

1908
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:26,260
Yeah.
You want people want him to run for 

1909
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:27,010
President Joe Piscopo.
That's right.

1910
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,230
He was the Jersey guy.
I'm from Jersey.

1911
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,900
Are you from Jersey?
Where's Rachel dratch.

1912
01:29:31,901 --> 01:29:34,990
She was killing it.
Garrett Morris?

1913
01:29:35,530 --> 01:29:36,610
Yeah.
There's a lot of them.

1914
01:29:36,611 --> 01:29:39,400
And you forget Janeane Garofalo was on 
snl.

1915
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:40,540
Oh Shit,
I didn't know that.

1916
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,640
I totally forgot that.
That's right.

1917
01:29:42,641 --> 01:29:44,260
Gilbert Godfrey,
Dennis Miller,

1918
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,170
uberconference.
Shannon,

1919
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,580
whenever that happened to molly,
she was huge on there.

1920
01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:51,550
She was huge off of their members.
She had a bunch of movies.

1921
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:54,360
What happened to her?
I think one of the movies bombed.

1922
01:29:54,370 --> 01:29:58,230
She had like two and a bombed tall.
Takes a bath.

1923
01:29:58,510 --> 01:30:00,280
I didn't know Sarah Silverman was on 
snl.

1924
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:03,300
She was for a little bit,
I don't know anything.

1925
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:05,860
I really barely,
barely,

1926
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,290
barely pay attention,
but yeah,

1927
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:13,320
that's A.
I mean if you look at all times,

1928
01:30:13,361 --> 01:30:18,361
get shows.
I mean snl had to do a live one every 

1929
01:30:18,361 --> 01:30:22,531
week.
They had to do all new material every 

1930
01:30:22,531 --> 01:30:22,531
week.
Do it in front.

1931
01:30:22,531 --> 01:30:22,531
The studio audience,
do it,

1932
01:30:22,531 --> 01:30:23,650
live on television,
a lot of impediments,

1933
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:27,730
but as far as overall quality,
best one ever Chappelle show.

1934
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:30,790
Then what number two might be in living 
color.

1935
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:34,000
People forgot about it in living color.
That was hilarious.

1936
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:38,930
And also came out swinging.
Handyman.

1937
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:43,450
They had a handicap superhero.
Why you couldn't do that today?

1938
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,780
You could do the fire Marshall Bill.
Get the fuck Outta here.

1939
01:30:46,781 --> 01:30:47,740
You can't do that.

1940
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:49,480
That's,
that's,

1941
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,150
that's just time.
But when I think about that time,

1942
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:54,530
it's just time and insight.
Alright.

1943
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:57,730
Can you do a sketch show?
He's at the comedy store.

1944
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:02,190
His brothers.
They're fucking Jim Carey's there.

1945
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:05,330
David Allen greer is around free 
killers.

1946
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:07,990
You just kill us.
Like just waiting for a shot now.

1947
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:09,280
David.
David,

1948
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:12,640
what's his name?
He was a skinny guy.

1949
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:14,080
Tommy Davidson.
Tommy Davidson.

1950
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:19,060
That's all this talent,
just just needing a shot and a fly girl,

1951
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,070
Jennifer,
Jennifer Lopez.

1952
01:31:22,030 --> 01:31:25,060
Wow.
And the other Puerto Rican leader.

1953
01:31:25,061 --> 01:31:27,040
The fly girls.
I forgot her name right now.

1954
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,470
Rosie Perez.
Rosie Perez.

1955
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:32,020
Like how much shit came out of that 
show?

1956
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:33,560
Crazy.
Even afterwards,

1957
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:38,610
Jamie Foxx came on just careers that are
still going man.

1958
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:45,800
And then there was mad tv where you'd 
Watch mad TV will be on like seasoned 

1959
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,240
Tanney Blake that chose to what the 
fuck.

1960
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:53,130
But Mad TV had a bunch of great sketches
to people just forgot.

1961
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,920
They had really good innovative sketches
to.

1962
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:59,740
And that was like when people were 
comparing inside Schumer,

1963
01:31:59,741 --> 01:32:04,741
like a lot of the shows they were saying
a lot of the episodes that were saying 

1964
01:32:04,741 --> 01:32:05,650
we were ripped off,
ripped off from mad tv,

1965
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:11,520
but part of that is because you run on a
premises like didn't the simpsons like 

1966
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:15,330
South Park always used to joke around 
about like simpsons late.

1967
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,480
They had episodes called Simpson's 
already did it?

1968
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,310
Yeah.
Because everything.

1969
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:22,120
You're stealing from yourself because 
you've got new riders.

1970
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:23,410
Yeah.
There's like,

1971
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:26,100
since it's been almost 20 years,
maybe longer,

1972
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:29,770
east South Park's been on 20 years now,
so somebody who's been writing,

1973
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,220
I think the simpsons or Ron Haiti's.

1974
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:34,360
Yeah,
they might've been close to 30 years for

1975
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:39,361
sure.
So somebody who's just been writing on 

1976
01:32:39,361 --> 01:32:39,460
the simpsons five years,
just five years,

1977
01:32:39,461 --> 01:32:42,760
which is a long time,
can come up with a premise that was dead

1978
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:46,780
in year 10 or the simpsons and not know 
and everybody there,

1979
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,030
they might've forgotten,
just fuck it,

1980
01:32:49,031 --> 01:32:50,110
let's do it.
Yeah.

1981
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:52,750
It doesn't matter as long as you could 
do it right.

1982
01:32:52,751 --> 01:32:54,430
It's like,
yeah,

1983
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:57,580
no one's.
I mean there's got to be someone,

1984
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:01,510
but no one can probably recall every 
episode of the simpsons.

1985
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:07,100
That's I'm probably wrong.
It's probably some real super fans out 

1986
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:07,510
there that can do it.
I'm sure you do.

1987
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,590
They go,
Jamie's like,

1988
01:33:08,591 --> 01:33:11,050
I've got blood.
Yeah,

1989
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:12,370
no,
for sure.

1990
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:18,120
Yeah.
It seems like you get to a certain 

1991
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:21,181
number of episodes of things for sure.
They've covered virtually,

1992
01:33:21,521 --> 01:33:25,330
at least close to every subject,
but maybe not,

1993
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:31,360
you know,
but the thing about cartoons though is 

1994
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:31,360
that you could just do anything.

1995
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:36,110
This,
it's so much more beautiful in terms of 

1996
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:36,110
like,
wait,

1997
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:38,611
you can get away with kill people.
They come back to life next week and 

1998
01:33:38,611 --> 01:33:40,060
I'll have to explain it.
You know like South Park can do anything

1999
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:43,480
it could do and their animation is so 
crude and simple.

2000
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:45,970
They whacked together a show in a matter
of minutes.

2001
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:47,860
They can,
something happen today.

2002
01:33:47,861 --> 01:33:50,440
They can put a show up tomorrow.
They literally could.

2003
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:54,240
I mean I'm sure there's such a well 
oiled machine and then knight,

2004
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:58,960
those guys work ethic is just insane 
that Trey Parker guys off the charts.

2005
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,270
They got rock work ethic.
Yeah.

2006
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:05,080
Like during their brain they bring you.
I wonder what that's about.

2007
01:34:05,230 --> 01:34:08,590
Like what keeps a person going that hard
for so long.

2008
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:13,180
I know like because it can't be the 
money.

2009
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:18,160
I wonder.
I mean it's gotta be the creativity.

2010
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:19,650
It's just got to be psych.

2011
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:25,080
Just seeing the finished product,
but they're also like very socially 

2012
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,020
responsible.
You know,

2013
01:34:26,021 --> 01:34:28,480
like they'll,
they'll shit on people and things go bad

2014
01:34:28,481 --> 01:34:31,680
in the news and they'll,
they'll come after people know.

2015
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,870
I liked that about them.
I do too.

2016
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:35,520
Yeah man.
Well that Carlos,

2017
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:40,540
when Kanye West Phish Dick's episode,
Jesus Christ,

2018
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:42,940
and that was when he was on comedy 
central,

2019
01:34:43,630 --> 01:34:44,740
there was like,
whoa.

2020
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:48,850
They went hard and team America,
world police.

2021
01:34:48,851 --> 01:34:50,380
They do that on the side.
Like what?

2022
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,390
In the book of Mormon?
Yeah.

2023
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,000
Yeah.
Just just super creative guys.

2024
01:34:55,001 --> 01:34:57,620
Hey Man.
Makes you feel lazy.

2025
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:02,890
Yeah,
there's a lot of people out there 

2026
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:02,890
apparently make me feel lazy.
Yours,

2027
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:05,000
your schedule.
You keep going,

2028
01:35:05,410 --> 01:35:07,190
right?
How the fuck is he doing this shit?

2029
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:08,510
Coffee,
coffee,

2030
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:13,550
coffee,
some deep seated desire to figure things

2031
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:14,390
out.
I don't know.

2032
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:20,260
I wonder.
I like to do a lot of shit that's not 

2033
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:21,140
work related to leaning more towards 
doing more of that lately.

2034
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:24,460
I think that after a certain point,
at a certain point in time,

2035
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:29,470
I can't keep doing three things.
Can't keep working for the UFC doing a 

2036
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:30,770
podcast and doing standup.
I'm going to have to chop it down to two

2037
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:35,800
or one some day it will be just stand up
occasionally standing occasionally.

2038
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:42,680
Yeah.
I mean you get to a certain point.

2039
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:44,870
You mean?
Do you want to just,

2040
01:35:44,871 --> 01:35:46,750
um,
I don't know.

2041
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:51,760
I guess stand up,
I don't really have a burnout feeling 

2042
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:55,481
because I always create new stuff every 
couple of years and it's always about 

2043
01:35:55,481 --> 01:35:58,541
putting it together,
but I mean how many more years are you 

2044
01:35:58,541 --> 01:35:58,790
going to want to do that?
Like so what's like,

2045
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:01,730
what's your ultimate like later on 
future goal?

2046
01:36:01,731 --> 01:36:04,440
Let's say even five years from now,
like what?

2047
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:07,700
What do you think would make you happy 
doing does the part of the problem?

2048
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:11,240
I don't have any goals of zero goals.
This is my goal.

2049
01:36:11,241 --> 01:36:14,960
Do the best standup I could do.
Try to do the best podcasts I can do,

2050
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:17,360
do the best job when I'm doing 
commentary.

2051
01:36:17,361 --> 01:36:19,850
Just do the best I could do while I'm 
doing it and enjoy it.

2052
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,230
That's simple enough.
Yeah,

2053
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:23,570
that's it.
I don't really have like a,

2054
01:36:23,571 --> 01:36:28,571
you know,
I wanna make x amount of money or x 

2055
01:36:28,571 --> 01:36:28,571
amount of.
I don't,

2056
01:36:28,571 --> 01:36:29,320
I just don't want it to suck.
Right.

2057
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:34,480
My,
my whole motivation is don't put 

2058
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,420
anything that sucks.
Put out things that people enjoy.

2059
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:39,560
Figure out a way to make it enjoyable.
Do put all your effort into it because I

2060
01:36:39,561 --> 01:36:44,000
know that if I don't do that,
I will feel like shit.

2061
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:49,240
Right.
I know if I like have a show that's not 

2062
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:51,731
so good and we've all had those,
or a podcast is not so good and I've 

2063
01:36:51,731 --> 01:36:52,280
definitely had those just don't.

2064
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:53,780
It does not feel good.
Right?

2065
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:57,080
They don't always come out perfect.
There's no way around that.

2066
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:59,310
Especially when we're doing these live 
shows.

2067
01:36:59,311 --> 01:37:02,210
Man,
live shows have so many variables.

2068
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:05,890
The time of the show,
how tired the audiences,

2069
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:07,610
how tired you are,
how you've been traveling,

2070
01:37:07,611 --> 01:37:09,230
are you sick,
you know?

2071
01:37:09,231 --> 01:37:14,231
Um,
there's so many things that can affect 

2072
01:37:14,231 --> 01:37:15,620
like how you performance comes out.
Even if you like consciously try to pump

2073
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:18,300
yourself up.
I've had some bad shows when I,

2074
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,450
when I wasn't feeling good.
That's hard,

2075
01:37:20,451 --> 01:37:25,451
right?
When you just don't have the energy or 

2076
01:37:25,451 --> 01:37:28,481
the feeling in the bits the same because
you're feeling sick or bad.

2077
01:37:28,881 --> 01:37:32,420
Shows help you get better shows.
Therefore,

2078
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:33,740
you know,
they're like,

2079
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:35,810
you didn't do this,
do this next time.

2080
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:39,080
They didn't do that work on that.
Also,

2081
01:37:39,081 --> 01:37:43,070
the sick feeling of like,
I don't let like a really good show.

2082
01:37:43,071 --> 01:37:45,020
I don't even like a show that's like,
that was pretty good.

2083
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:47,120
I don't even like that.
Like if it's like,

2084
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:47,960
that was pretty good.
I was like,

2085
01:37:48,010 --> 01:37:49,400
ugh.
Are we talking?

2086
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:50,810
Standardizing it better?
Yeah.

2087
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:52,400
I'm always like,
why isn't it better?

2088
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:55,230
Why isn't it like my best show ever?
My last show might've been my best.

2089
01:37:55,231 --> 01:37:56,100
Whenever.
Why

2090
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:00,150
isn't this one my new best one ever 
different audience.

2091
01:38:00,151 --> 01:38:01,710
Different place venue.
I know,

2092
01:38:01,711 --> 01:38:05,460
but I mean that's,
I think that's my motivation.

2093
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,750
That's what keeps me going.
Like trying to figure out how to weight,

2094
01:38:07,751 --> 01:38:12,751
uh,
and then also trying to figure out what 

2095
01:38:12,751 --> 01:38:15,771
to do with my material.
Like should I be writing more stuff 

2096
01:38:15,771 --> 01:38:15,771
here?
So I'd just be honing this down.

2097
01:38:15,771 --> 01:38:20,451
Like how do I approach,
should I toss some of this aside and 

2098
01:38:20,451 --> 01:38:21,450
throw some new stuff in there and then 
bring it back.

2099
01:38:21,451 --> 01:38:26,451
And it was constantly trying to make.
When you creating something like when 

2100
01:38:26,451 --> 01:38:28,440
you created your CD,
don't you get that feeling sort of where

2101
01:38:28,441 --> 01:38:29,160
you're like,
okay,

2102
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:33,480
I gotTa Kinda engineer this a little.
But I also got to kind of like let it be

2103
01:38:33,481 --> 01:38:34,980
itself,
right?

2104
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:40,260
[inaudible] like just I'm,
I'm like that Kinda before I start doing

2105
01:38:42,991 --> 01:38:47,400
a joke,
like if I'm doing a joke and I'm like,

2106
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:52,580
or if I think of a joke,
like my elimination process of what I 

2107
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:57,300
should or shouldn't do starts before I 
started doing the joke.

2108
01:38:58,130 --> 01:39:00,990
The joke fits into my criteria.
Then I started doing it.

2109
01:39:00,991 --> 01:39:05,991
So then I'm not wasting time.
I don't feel like I'm wasting time from 

2110
01:39:05,991 --> 01:39:09,090
the beginning.
Like I think creatively,

2111
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:15,470
like I try to do the things that I 
really like to talk about so then I 

2112
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:21,291
don't have to worry about later on 
looking at the whole thing as much and 

2113
01:39:21,291 --> 01:39:21,700
saying I got to lose this and I got to 
lose that.

2114
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:27,290
So I started early.
So then the things that I'm talking 

2115
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:27,290
about,
I'm already feeling them.

2116
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:31,800
It's just sometimes when you hold onto 
things a long time and you're doing them

2117
01:39:31,801 --> 01:39:33,530
for a long time,
you don't feel it,

2118
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:37,780
then you don't feel it anymore and the 
audience tells you you're not feeling it

2119
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:40,470
anymore based on the reaction you get 
now.

2120
01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:46,010
And from when the reaction you used to 
get and you could feel that thing 

2121
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:46,010
getting tired.

2122
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:50,120
That's why I always say that standup,
is it some sort of massive gnosis?

2123
01:39:50,450 --> 01:39:55,450
It's very similar.
It's not like someone's tricking you or 

2124
01:39:55,450 --> 01:39:55,450
telling you what to do.
We're going to get you to quit smoking.

2125
01:39:55,450 --> 01:39:57,350
Not In that way.
But when the guys on stage,

2126
01:39:57,351 --> 01:39:59,810
like if I'm in the back of the room and 
I'm watching you and you're killing.

2127
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:04,550
One of the things that's really funny is
I start thinking the way you're thinking

2128
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:10,030
when you crack a joke about something,
it's like I'm in your group and I'm 

2129
01:40:10,030 --> 01:40:13,040
letting you do all the thinking for me.
Like if you watch a really good comic,

2130
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,330
like,
like if I'm watching you,

2131
01:40:14,331 --> 01:40:16,490
if I'm in the back of the room and I'm 
watching you,

2132
01:40:16,491 --> 01:40:21,491
I don't have any.
I just let you do all the thinking 

2133
01:40:21,491 --> 01:40:21,530
because I know you know,
I know you know what you're doing.

2134
01:40:21,710 --> 01:40:23,480
I know you're going to take it down a 
funny place.

2135
01:40:23,481 --> 01:40:24,650
It's going to be great.
Here we go.

2136
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:28,580
Just let it happen.
But the moment that you don't trust that

2137
01:40:28,581 --> 01:40:33,581
person anymore moment they fuck up or 
something goes weird and the spell gets 

2138
01:40:33,581 --> 01:40:34,280
broken,
you know,

2139
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:35,540
and then you're like,
oh,

2140
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:37,520
that guy's just fucked up.
That joke.

2141
01:40:37,690 --> 01:40:40,310
This joke sucks.
Now this joke's not good.

2142
01:40:40,490 --> 01:40:42,050
I'm not gonna.
Let them think for me anymore.

2143
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:42,820
Oh,
this,

2144
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,590
this subjects terrible.
All the subjects.

2145
01:40:45,591 --> 01:40:50,591
Just gross.
I was just trying to get noises out of 

2146
01:40:50,591 --> 01:40:50,591
me now,
you know?

2147
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:51,010
Yeah.
You,

2148
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:54,730
you gotta earn the audience's trust to 
you copilot.

2149
01:40:54,731 --> 01:40:57,910
The evening 100 percent and take over.
Yeah.

2150
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:03,280
And just relax and listen to you.
And you could take it and you bring it 

2151
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,680
back as possible to,
as long as you're like real honest about

2152
01:41:05,681 --> 01:41:06,550
what's happening.
Yeah.

2153
01:41:06,551 --> 01:41:08,040
Yeah.
Like when I was just,

2154
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:11,890
when Montreal,
we did a show before,

2155
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:16,420
so we have a warm up show so we're going
to tape the lol thing.

2156
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,860
And so they give you a warm up show.
So I started.

2157
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,310
So do you have eight minutes?
And there's other comics on the show.

2158
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:29,820
So in the first,
I don't even know what jokes I'm going 

2159
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:30,490
to do for the lol thing because 
everybody's like,

2160
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:33,610
what is the lol thing?
It's like Kevin Hart's new network.

2161
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:34,420
Oh,
okay.

2162
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:38,500
And then you're going to do it an eight 
minute segment on it and to network.

2163
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:40,330
It's a network.
What's he going to put it on?

2164
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:42,130
The thing is on the Internet.
Oh,

2165
01:41:42,131 --> 01:41:42,910
okay.
Yeah.

2166
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:48,440
So there's a lot.
So it's a whole like Internet channel 

2167
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:49,810
and it's all comedy.
So he's doing scripted,

2168
01:41:49,811 --> 01:41:54,811
he's taping Mike stand up shows where 
the host and the people who have half an

2169
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:01,800
hours on it.
So I just went to do like an eight 

2170
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:04,501
minute segment and during the warm up 
show some chick was just talking in the 

2171
01:42:05,741 --> 01:42:09,340
beginning of my set and talking to you 
or just talking,

2172
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:14,400
talking to a girlfriend who sit in.
The first joke went well,

2173
01:42:15,850 --> 01:42:19,660
but then I have to stop and say,
are you going to shut the fuck up and we

2174
01:42:19,661 --> 01:42:20,980
should,
you know what?

2175
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:24,640
I'm going to have you kicked out.
And nobody in the club moved.

2176
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,200
And she's like,
no you're not.

2177
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,660
She said,
no you're not.

2178
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:31,390
I said,
all right,

2179
01:42:31,391 --> 01:42:32,560
we'll see.
We're going to have to kicked out.

2180
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:34,210
And I said,
who's running this shit?

2181
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:39,690
And this is the eight dot.
I only have eight minutes and I got to 

2182
01:42:39,690 --> 01:42:40,030
get back on track.
She said,

2183
01:42:40,031 --> 01:42:41,020
no,
you're not.

2184
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:45,070
Wow.
So she thought she could just talk.

2185
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:45,620
Yeah,
she goes,

2186
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:46,450
that's.
And you know what?

2187
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:51,570
The club did not kick her out.
You see us do your whole set with her 

2188
01:42:51,570 --> 01:42:51,570
sitting there?
Yeah,

2189
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:55,420
but I got them back on track because 
they did want her to shut up and she did

2190
01:42:55,421 --> 01:42:58,450
shut up.
But the defiance I've never.

2191
01:42:58,690 --> 01:43:01,660
And then some con Canadian comic later 
on it's like,

2192
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:06,690
you know what,
you should write the club because we 

2193
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:09,181
have this prop in the club every time,
but if you write a letter to the owner 

2194
01:43:09,181 --> 01:43:10,030
and tell them they never have security 
here.

2195
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:13,030
And it was a comedy nest.
Oh,

2196
01:43:13,031 --> 01:43:14,140
in Montreal.
Montreal.

2197
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:17,730
I've been in that spot before.
Does the comedy works.

2198
01:43:17,731 --> 01:43:20,470
So they're the little tiny spot I think 
is still there.

2199
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:22,140
That place is amazing.
Yeah.

2200
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:23,750
It's like a place upstairs.
Yeah.

2201
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:26,410
It's just like a little fucking room,
a hotbox dude.

2202
01:43:26,411 --> 01:43:27,740
There's like 80 people.
Yeah,

2203
01:43:28,030 --> 01:43:31,450
like maybe I did a one man show in there
like two years ago.

2204
01:43:31,451 --> 01:43:33,430
They're like an hour and they're fucking
amazing.

2205
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:36,340
Yeah.
My Charles is an interesting place.

2206
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:37,660
You know,
it's a funny thing too,

2207
01:43:37,661 --> 01:43:42,661
like during the festival,
it's like a becomes like this really 

2208
01:43:42,661 --> 01:43:44,260
intense environment for comedians.
A lot of pressure.

2209
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:48,190
People go there to be seen kill here to 
make deals,

2210
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:50,620
development deals and shit from 
Montreal.

2211
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:55,960
So weird.
We're thinking we got to go to another 

2212
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,881
country.
Going to a country that doesn't even 

2213
01:43:57,881 --> 01:43:57,881
speak English.
I mean in,

2214
01:43:57,881 --> 01:43:58,730
in Quebec they were English,
French,

2215
01:43:58,731 --> 01:44:00,770
French chat refuses to speak English.

2216
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,530
Well that one section,
one section,

2217
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:05,840
but it is kind of like visiting another 
land.

2218
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:10,930
It doesn't feel like,
like if you go to Toronto it might as 

2219
01:44:10,930 --> 01:44:11,240
well be Detroit or something.
I mean it's a nice city,

2220
01:44:11,241 --> 01:44:13,250
but I mean a little nicer than Detroit I
guess.

2221
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:15,820
Sorry,
Detroit people get mad towards.

2222
01:44:16,330 --> 01:44:17,840
Come on Bro.
But okay.

2223
01:44:17,841 --> 01:44:19,860
Let's say Chicago might as well be 
Chicago,

2224
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:22,370
might as well be.
I mean it's just another big city.

2225
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:24,080
It doesn't feel like you're in another 
world.

2226
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:27,020
If you go to Montreal you feel like you 
might as well be in Europe.

2227
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:32,130
Yeah.
Because people start instantly talking 

2228
01:44:32,130 --> 01:44:32,130
to you in French.
Yeah.

2229
01:44:32,130 --> 01:44:35,140
And then then they realize you don't 
know any French and then start talking 

2230
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:36,970
English without a French accent.
Yeah.

2231
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:40,100
Like how do you know another language?
How do you know?

2232
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,090
I get,
you know,

2233
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:43,460
in another language,
but how do you do it without an accent?

2234
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:44,300
Yeah.
How do you do it?

2235
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:48,100
How do you sound straight up?
English speaking English.

2236
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:53,240
How do you stand straight up French 
without the English interruption in your

2237
01:44:54,141 --> 01:44:55,660
French accent.
It's crazy.

2238
01:44:55,670 --> 01:44:56,680
You.
Yeah.

2239
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:59,420
How do you good switch.
Yeah.

2240
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:01,790
I haven't been to Montreal on a wild 
man.

2241
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:06,260
Was there like a for a UFC maybe a year 
ago or so?

2242
01:45:06,710 --> 01:45:07,880
I need to get back up there.
Yeah.

2243
01:45:07,881 --> 01:45:09,080
The women are beautiful.
They man.

2244
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:10,880
It's an amazing place.
Amazing place.

2245
01:45:11,090 --> 01:45:13,500
Cold as fuck.
He in the winter?

2246
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,840
Yeah.
I don't fuck with it in the winter.

2247
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:16,380
I still winters up there.
Yeah.

2248
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:19,250
So I could headline.
I've done shows up there in the winter,

2249
01:45:19,251 --> 01:45:24,251
but it's like in and out,
like they used to do shows that black 

2250
01:45:24,251 --> 01:45:25,860
shows at this club called club soda.
Yeah,

2251
01:45:25,861 --> 01:45:27,200
I know club Soda.
I used to work there.

2252
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:28,100
Yeah,
it was dope.

2253
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:29,150
Yeah,
that was a nice.

2254
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:30,680
That was a nice room.
It was a nice spot.

2255
01:45:30,681 --> 01:45:35,681
Yeah,
that's whenever I used to do the 

2256
01:45:35,681 --> 01:45:35,681
festival.
I used to club soda are.

2257
01:45:35,681 --> 01:45:35,900
Oh Shit.
Oh,

2258
01:45:35,950 --> 01:45:37,130
club soda is great,
man.

2259
01:45:37,131 --> 01:45:37,910
I did.
Um,

2260
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:39,860
I did,
uh,

2261
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,440
the comedy from the danger zone,
but dom,

2262
01:45:42,450 --> 01:45:46,610
I rarer they're timing from club soda to
take to way back in the day,

2263
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:49,910
way back in the day.
Dom irrera and I met in Montreal.

2264
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:52,250
Have a great festival,
man.

2265
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:56,870
It's like we call it like a comedy 
summer camp for comics.

2266
01:45:56,871 --> 01:45:57,360
I,
yeah.

2267
01:45:57,620 --> 01:46:02,620
Talk about just all the comics pretty 
much in the same hotel or spread out who

2268
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:09,960
wrote a few hotels and you're just 
hanging out laughing,

2269
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:12,490
having fun in the lobby.
Everybody goes off to their shows.

2270
01:46:12,491 --> 01:46:14,920
Some people come to your shows,
he's just,

2271
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,810
he's just having fun.
But when you're working,

2272
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:20,350
how many go?
Uh,

2273
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:21,900
it starts like two weeks,
right?

2274
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:23,310
Yeah.
It's almost like two weeks.

2275
01:46:23,311 --> 01:46:28,311
[inaudible] they start like the ethnic 
show and some other shows a week ahead 

2276
01:46:28,311 --> 01:46:31,210
course.
Last week was last week was like the 

2277
01:46:31,210 --> 01:46:34,190
last,
like the full full on like regular week.

2278
01:46:34,490 --> 01:46:35,800
The last week is.
Yeah.

2279
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:38,180
Yeah.
It's um,

2280
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:41,240
there's not another one.
They try to do a couple of the ones that

2281
01:46:41,241 --> 01:46:43,100
used to have an aspen ones,
which is really good.

2282
01:46:43,101 --> 01:46:44,840
I shut down.
You know why?

2283
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:47,600
Because it was fucking executives.
They would just go skiing all day.

2284
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:49,350
They didn't really want to watch the 
shows.

2285
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:50,010
They go to

2286
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:51,310
the shows and be tired.
Fuck,

2287
01:46:51,311 --> 01:46:53,310
because there's no air and they'd been 
skiing all day.

2288
01:46:53,690 --> 01:46:56,330
You know,
you ever been asking other than that?

2289
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:57,600
Yeah,
and I caught the flu up there,

2290
01:46:57,610 --> 01:47:02,080
the worst flu I've ever had at the 
festival because it was going around and

2291
01:47:02,081 --> 01:47:07,081
I was sick and I had to tape the TV show
and I mustered up enough energy to do 

2292
01:47:07,901 --> 01:47:11,440
the taping and then I just slept in bed 
for like two days.

2293
01:47:12,190 --> 01:47:15,910
And then I have to check out the thought
out of my hotel at 11,

2294
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:19,300
but my flight wasn't till like seven.
Oh Shit.

2295
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:24,360
So I'm like,
I'm like the worst flu ever that I've 

2296
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:27,661
ever had.
And you had to fly with it and had to 

2297
01:47:27,661 --> 01:47:27,661
fly with it.
And when,

2298
01:47:27,661 --> 01:47:29,680
when I checked out this,
how bad I was when I checked out at 11,

2299
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:32,890
the guy looked at me and I told him that
my flight was at seven.

2300
01:47:32,891 --> 01:47:37,891
He's like,
I'm going to give you a room so you 

2301
01:47:37,891 --> 01:47:37,891
could sleep in.
Oh Wow.

2302
01:47:37,891 --> 01:47:38,830
Until your flight.
That saved my life.

2303
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:44,430
Wow.
Let's lay down for like maybe three 

2304
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:44,430
hours that it helped.
It helped.

2305
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:46,180
It helped me enough to have enough 
energy to this.

2306
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:48,670
And then you're at the airport and I 
think the flight got delayed.

2307
01:47:48,671 --> 01:47:53,671
So now I'm like in the airport,
worst flu ever for like two hours.

2308
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:56,450
When your immune system is compromised 
like that to you,

2309
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,900
it's amazing how little energy.
Yeah.

2310
01:47:58,990 --> 01:48:00,700
Like when people don't.
That's like a cliche.

2311
01:48:00,701 --> 01:48:03,210
That health is the most important thing.
You're like,

2312
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:06,150
fuck up bitch.
Money's the most important thing.

2313
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:11,160
The fuck out of here with your health.
I'll cough and count my cat feeling 

2314
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:11,160
great.
Not True.

2315
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:14,050
Health is everything.
If you just feel a little shitty,

2316
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:19,080
just a little shitty.
It markedly changes the way you look at 

2317
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,830
life.
If you cut your thumb right,

2318
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:23,560
that changes your whole day.
It could,

2319
01:48:23,570 --> 01:48:24,910
right.
Especially if it gets infected.

2320
01:48:24,930 --> 01:48:26,110
Yeah.
That changes your whole.

2321
01:48:26,140 --> 01:48:28,360
If you stub your toe and that shit 
hurts,

2322
01:48:28,390 --> 01:48:33,390
it changed.
Like any little thing could change your 

2323
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:33,600
whole day,
like healthwise,

2324
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:35,590
stubbing your toe.
Don't judge Bro.

2325
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:36,400
Nah,
but you know,

2326
01:48:36,401 --> 01:48:37,160
like,
like,

2327
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:37,690
you know,
like,

2328
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:42,040
like some type of hurt or cut or just 
something he injury headache.

2329
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:43,750
Yeah.
Changes everything.

2330
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:45,120
Yup.
Yeah.

2331
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:48,190
And um,
surgery.

2332
01:48:48,370 --> 01:48:50,170
Yeah.
In my buddy's wife,

2333
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:54,650
got rotator cuff surgery just fucked up 
for weeks apparently.

2334
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:58,060
Just can't put your shirt on.
Ah,

2335
01:48:58,420 --> 01:48:59,230
agony.
I was like,

2336
01:48:59,231 --> 01:49:02,200
oh no that doesn't sound good.
Yeah.

2337
01:49:02,201 --> 01:49:07,201
Anytime something goes wrong.
But I think like overall health and 

2338
01:49:07,201 --> 01:49:07,630
wellness is so fucking important.
Yeah,

2339
01:49:07,631 --> 01:49:09,550
for sure.
It's so important.

2340
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:12,880
It's like there's so many people out 
there that just don't take care of their

2341
01:49:12,881 --> 01:49:15,100
meat wagon.
You gotTa,

2342
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:16,990
you gotTa take care of your meat 
vehicle.

2343
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:18,730
You have to,
you just,

2344
01:49:19,150 --> 01:49:24,150
you know what's really crazy to me,
like people that I know that don't take 

2345
01:49:24,150 --> 01:49:27,091
care of their body.
And then they talk about being 

2346
01:49:27,091 --> 01:49:27,091
depressed.
So what did you think?

2347
01:49:27,091 --> 01:49:30,420
You think you just say poor shit down 
your whole and you would feel good,

2348
01:49:31,110 --> 01:49:36,110
right?
Like just no sleep and tons of 

2349
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:36,110
cigarettes.
Tons of booze.

2350
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:37,530
And you thought you'd feel good,
right?

2351
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:40,120
You shot right?
I don't know why I feel sick.

2352
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:43,150
You don't.
Which has been filled with shit lately.

2353
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:44,830
Doing the same thing over and over 
again.

2354
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:46,720
Taking drugs.
Wow.

2355
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:48,130
So did you see

2356
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:50,950
a walk to health?
I watched a,

2357
01:49:50,951 --> 01:49:55,630
a doctor's response to what the hell?
Watch this.

2358
01:49:55,690 --> 01:50:00,690
Because I had heard it was like some 
crazy vegan propaganda is not based on 

2359
01:50:00,690 --> 01:50:04,501
science at all.
Like they were trying to say that a fat 

2360
01:50:04,501 --> 01:50:07,300
causes diabetes and fact that clogged up
and doctors that have looked at it,

2361
01:50:07,301 --> 01:50:10,360
there's been a ton of debunkers online 
that have looked at it.

2362
01:50:10,361 --> 01:50:12,550
They said this is pseudoscience.
This is not real.

2363
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:15,430
Like definitely a Vegan diet can be 
healthy,

2364
01:50:15,470 --> 01:50:20,470
definitely taken a lot of vegetables,
can be really good for you and 

2365
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:22,420
definitely a,
it's good to have nutrient rich foods,

2366
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:27,780
whether it's fresh vegetables or 
whatever you want to eat and you could 

2367
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:27,850
absolutely,
if you,

2368
01:50:28,030 --> 01:50:32,890
if you're careful and you're smart about
your saturated fats and unsaturated fats

2369
01:50:32,891 --> 01:50:33,760
and um,
you know,

2370
01:50:33,761 --> 01:50:34,600
especially,
uh,

2371
01:50:34,601 --> 01:50:36,550
essential fatty acids and things like 
that,

2372
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:38,980
you can live a very healthy life is a 
Vegan,

2373
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:39,970
just do it right.

2374
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:44,470
But these guys lie.
They went a little overboard.

2375
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:46,840
They didn't just,
you don't just document what it is,

2376
01:50:46,841 --> 01:50:51,841
is a Vegan proselytizing like doc,
it's like you're trying to do is get 

2377
01:50:52,241 --> 01:50:56,080
people to sign up for veganism but 
scaring the shit out of with lies.

2378
01:50:56,470 --> 01:50:59,890
And you're saying things like saturated 
fats and all these,

2379
01:51:00,190 --> 01:51:03,340
these things clog up your arteries that 
causes diabetes.

2380
01:51:04,210 --> 01:51:08,260
That's not true.
Like in that in is what the health,

2381
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:11,470
what is the same guys that made 
cowspiracy exactly.

2382
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:14,170
And they were wrong about that too.
When they came in here,

2383
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:17,500
they were talking about how many acres 
it takes for a cow to graze.

2384
01:51:17,501 --> 01:51:22,060
And all the negative aspects,
there's absolutely negative aspects when

2385
01:51:22,061 --> 01:51:27,061
it comes to animal agriculture and I 
think it's super important to be honest 

2386
01:51:27,061 --> 01:51:28,810
about those aspects.
Even when criticizing it,

2387
01:51:28,811 --> 01:51:32,600
you can't exaggerate it to make a case 
look better because the actual facts are

2388
01:51:32,601 --> 01:51:33,400
disturbing enough.

2389
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:38,620
Like especially factory farming when it 
comes to like cows and chet and pigs,

2390
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:42,190
it's disturbing to see them all stacked 
up in there like that.

2391
01:51:42,191 --> 01:51:44,470
It's disturbing to see those rivers of 
shit.

2392
01:51:44,471 --> 01:51:49,471
Where were people a run these pig farms 
and the shit comes and he filmed it with

2393
01:51:49,571 --> 01:51:52,090
a drone,
one of these giant commercial places.

2394
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:55,210
It's fucking disturbing.
That is straight up.

2395
01:51:55,211 --> 01:51:56,210
That's enough.
That's enough.

2396
01:51:56,410 --> 01:52:01,000
There's a ton of actual facts that are 
disturbing and as soon as you have these

2397
01:52:01,001 --> 01:52:06,001
doctors that are just bullshit artists 
that are saying all these things that 

2398
01:52:06,001 --> 01:52:10,771
aren't supported by science and when 
this one doctor goes over all the 

2399
01:52:10,771 --> 01:52:12,910
different things and what the health 
that are incorrect,

2400
01:52:12,911 --> 01:52:14,740
you kind of understand what it is they 
mean.

2401
01:52:14,741 --> 01:52:19,741
Well,
I'm sure they mean what they're trying 

2402
01:52:19,741 --> 01:52:20,110
to get people to quit eating processed 
meat,

2403
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:21,490
which is a very good idea.

2404
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:26,580
Now,
processed food is fucking terrible for 

2405
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:26,580
whether it's a food with a lot of 
preservatives,

2406
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:31,231
meets with a lot of preservatives.
All that stuff is definitely 100 

2407
01:52:31,231 --> 01:52:31,231
percent.
Not good for you,

2408
01:52:31,231 --> 01:52:34,720
but that doesn't mean that grassfed beef
is bad for you because it's not.

2409
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:39,850
It doesn't mean that you can't have a 
healthy diet with a salmon and fish,

2410
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:43,660
different kinds of ocean fish,
scallops,

2411
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:48,230
and use that as your primary protein 
source and then vegetables and have like

2412
01:52:48,231 --> 01:52:53,231
a super healthy diet because you will.
You will have a super healthy diet and 

2413
01:52:53,231 --> 01:52:55,490
you know there's a lot of arguments to 
avoid dairy.

2414
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:57,760
I think a lot of it depends on the 
individual.

2415
01:52:57,780 --> 01:53:00,140
A good arguments,
a lot of really good arguments,

2416
01:53:00,230 --> 01:53:03,140
really good arguments in terms of your 
immune system inflammation.

2417
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:06,290
There's a lot of really good arguments 
to avoid processed sugar.

2418
01:53:06,291 --> 01:53:09,590
There's a lot of really good arguments,
but I think it's like what we're talking

2419
01:53:09,591 --> 01:53:11,840
about earlier when you were talking 
about if you found those,

2420
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:15,620
those scrolls scrolls in Qumran,
you would kind of like,

2421
01:53:15,621 --> 01:53:16,780
wow,
this is what it's saying.

2422
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:21,790
I get all the bitches.
You figure out a way to lean it towards 

2423
01:53:21,790 --> 01:53:23,420
you will.
These people are clearly on team Vegan,

2424
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:28,450
which is great and it's fine.
The way to be on team Vegan and do it 

2425
01:53:28,450 --> 01:53:29,900
right is be healthy,
be nice and be honest,

2426
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:33,740
be honest because it's good enough and 
you're going to get plenty of those.

2427
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:34,840
There's a lot of those out there.
No,

2428
01:53:34,841 --> 01:53:36,380
no.
I don't want to discredit them.

2429
01:53:36,710 --> 01:53:37,720
And there's a lot of,
uh,

2430
01:53:37,950 --> 01:53:40,550
there's a lot of crazy vegans to that 
are just going to get mad at you.

2431
01:53:40,730 --> 01:53:45,730
And they just decided now that they're 
Vegan to just attack everyone who's not 

2432
01:53:45,730 --> 01:53:45,730
vegan.
I've seen those too.

2433
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:47,210
But that's just humans,
right?

2434
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:48,920
That's just,
that's just human shit.

2435
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:51,680
Human Shit.
So I mean,

2436
01:53:51,681 --> 01:53:56,681
I know a ton of people that are very 
happy being Vegan and you're one of 

2437
01:53:56,681 --> 01:53:56,681
them,
you know,

2438
01:53:56,681 --> 01:53:58,130
and I fuck with you all the time about 
it,

2439
01:53:58,131 --> 01:53:59,450
but you're a healthy dude.

2440
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:01,200
You've always been healthy,
you know,

2441
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:02,880
but you do it right.
Yeah,

2442
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:05,870
I mean I've done it wrong.
Like I've been an unhealthy Vegan,

2443
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:11,260
right?
Right now I got to stop fucking with 

2444
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:11,970
sodium.
What's wrong with sodium like this?

2445
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:14,990
High blood blood pressure wise,
that doesn't really happen.

2446
01:54:14,991 --> 01:54:16,330
That's not the.
We'll know.

2447
01:54:16,370 --> 01:54:17,780
See,
that's another misconception.

2448
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:23,260
The misconception about sodium is that 
sodium is somehow or another the cause 

2449
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:25,910
of high blood pressure that was put 
together by some bullshit ass doctor.

2450
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:29,270
One doctor pull that,
pull up the myth of sodium.

2451
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:30,950
This is crazy,
this story,

2452
01:54:30,951 --> 01:54:33,200
because so many people believe us as 
high blood pressure.

2453
01:54:33,290 --> 01:54:34,950
A lot of it's genetic,
genetic,

2454
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:36,710
genetic.
It could be,

2455
01:54:36,711 --> 01:54:39,170
you know,
dammit the sedentary lifestyle.

2456
01:54:39,171 --> 01:54:41,440
There's a lot of factors that sedentary 
lifestyle.

2457
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:43,160
Yeah,
you don't really work out.

2458
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:46,220
I'm shaking up the salt myth.
Here you go.

2459
01:54:46,221 --> 01:54:48,560
Chris crusher was actually been on the 
podcast before,

2460
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:54,420
uh,
and all ages salt has been invested as 

2461
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:57,380
a,
with a significance for exceeding that 

2462
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:57,380
inherent in its natural properties.

2463
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:57,470
I don't.
Okay.

2464
01:54:57,471 --> 01:55:01,430
That's a little wordy either.
I'm single,

2465
01:55:01,431 --> 01:55:02,300
most harmful.
Okay.

2466
01:55:02,301 --> 01:55:03,770
Here we go.
Uh,

2467
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:07,550
it's been referred to as the single most
harmful substance in the food supply.

2468
01:55:07,551 --> 01:55:08,870
But it's salt.
Really dangerous.

2469
01:55:08,871 --> 01:55:10,790
New New News.
Taking up the salt myth.

2470
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,350
Actually,
this is not what I'm looking for.

2471
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:14,720
What I want you to do is just pull up,
um,

2472
01:55:14,830 --> 01:55:19,830
the conspiracy about how one doctor 
wrote some bullshit paper about sodium.

2473
01:55:23,691 --> 01:55:26,030
You got that from scientific.
Okay.

2474
01:55:26,150 --> 01:55:28,640
Time to end the war on salt from 
scientific America.

2475
01:55:28,641 --> 01:55:32,030
The zealous,
a drive by politicians to limit our salt

2476
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:34,690
intake has little basis in science.
It's all bullshit.

2477
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:35,770
Make that larger please.
Ms.

2478
01:55:35,771 --> 01:55:38,210
Dot shitty for so many are like,
how do we.

2479
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:41,030
Yeah,
but we know what's real and what's not.

2480
01:55:41,110 --> 01:55:42,250
You know,
this is like it.

2481
01:55:42,251 --> 01:55:47,251
It started with a very clear beginning 
for this.

2482
01:55:47,491 --> 01:55:52,491
There was a,
there was a bullshit study that someone 

2483
01:55:52,491 --> 01:55:52,910
passed and you know there's also been a 
ton of bullshit here.

2484
01:55:52,910 --> 01:55:53,550
It is 19.
Oh,

2485
01:55:53,551 --> 01:55:58,551
four French doctors reported that six of
their subjects who had high blood 

2486
01:55:58,551 --> 01:55:59,070
pressure and known risk factor for heart
disease.

2487
01:55:59,071 --> 01:56:04,071
We're salt fiends,
worries escalated in the 19 seventies 

2488
01:56:04,071 --> 01:56:04,350
when Brookhaven national laboratory is 
Louis.

2489
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:09,530
Louis.
Dol claimed that he had unequivocal 

2490
01:56:09,530 --> 01:56:10,860
unequivocal evidence that salt causes 
hypertension.

2491
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:16,220
He induced high blood pressure in rats 
by feeding them the human equivalent of 

2492
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:20,280
500 grams of sodium today,
which is an insane amount today.

2493
01:56:20,281 --> 01:56:25,281
The average American consumes three 
point four grams of sodium or eight 

2494
01:56:25,281 --> 01:56:28,230
point four grams of salt a day.
A scroll up a little there.

2495
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:33,440
Doll also discovered that the population
tends to continue to be cited as strong 

2496
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:37,440
evidence of a link between salt intake 
and high blood pressure.

2497
01:56:37,441 --> 01:56:41,400
People living in countries with high 
salt consumption such as Japan also tend

2498
01:56:41,401 --> 01:56:42,900
to have high blood pressure and more 
strokes,

2499
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:48,230
but as a paper pointed out several years
later in American journal of 

2500
01:56:48,230 --> 01:56:51,261
hypertension,
scientists had little luck finding such 

2501
01:56:51,261 --> 01:56:51,261
associations when they compare it.

2502
01:56:51,261 --> 01:56:56,080
Sodium intakes within populations which 
suggested that genetics or other 

2503
01:56:56,161 --> 01:56:59,040
cultural factors might be the culprit.
Anyway,

2504
01:56:59,041 --> 01:57:04,041
this 1977 study affected the US Senate 
select committee on nutrition and human 

2505
01:57:05,701 --> 01:57:10,701
needs and they released a report 
recommending that Americans cut their 

2506
01:57:10,701 --> 01:57:14,271
salt intake by 50 to 85 percent based 
largely on dolls work,

2507
01:57:15,150 --> 01:57:18,540
so there's one dick fuck ruined it for 
everybody.

2508
01:57:18,541 --> 01:57:22,020
The ones put salt in your fries like you
can get off of that,

2509
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:27,080
but this is a salt is a mineral and it's
a natural part of being a human being.

2510
01:57:28,351 --> 01:57:30,810
It's an essential mineral essential 
mineral.

2511
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:35,190
It's like when you have endurance 
athletes and they go on these crazy runs

2512
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:37,590
and they do like a 100 miles.
They take salt.

2513
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:39,280
That's one of the things they said.
Yeah,

2514
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:41,760
they put salt in their body.
It wasn't data route.

2515
01:57:42,290 --> 01:57:47,290
It isn't gatorade a little bit.
We know what the best version of it 

2516
01:57:47,290 --> 01:57:47,360
apparently health wise is that Himalayan
salt.

2517
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:52,400
Right?
Because Himalayan salt has a bunch of 

2518
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:52,400
like natural based minerals in it.
Yeah.

2519
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:57,500
They recommend you take a little bit of 
him similarly and so I'll just drop a 

2520
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:59,160
little bit in your water in the morning 
and put some lemon in there.

2521
01:57:59,190 --> 01:57:59,400
Right.

2522
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:00,670
So,
so I,

2523
01:58:00,671 --> 01:58:05,380
I use data a little bit but I think with
Vegan food,

2524
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:10,820
like probably based on my genetics 
because they try to make it taste a 

2525
01:58:11,441 --> 01:58:16,441
certain way.
They might put a lot of fucking salt in 

2526
01:58:16,441 --> 01:58:16,441
there.
Oh okay.

2527
01:58:16,441 --> 01:58:21,301
So I think so,
but I could feel something towards 

2528
01:58:21,301 --> 01:58:22,540
December,
like in my body whenever I ate.

2529
01:58:23,050 --> 01:58:28,050
So now that I've cut back on I like are 
more and I'll just eat places that have 

2530
01:58:28,451 --> 01:58:31,900
less salt because salt and shit.
But some people oversalt shit.

2531
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:34,030
It also could be sugar,
sugar,

2532
01:58:34,190 --> 01:58:35,080
sugar too.

2533
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:39,450
Well you should do honestly is I could 
send you to a guy.

2534
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:42,130
She gets some blood work done.
I did.

2535
01:58:42,131 --> 01:58:44,630
Some did.
What did he say it was?

2536
01:58:44,710 --> 01:58:46,840
It was,
it was the guy said salt.

2537
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:49,810
Too much salt.
But that guy's a fucking idiot.

2538
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:52,280
Jesus Christ.
You went to an idiot doctor.

2539
01:58:52,580 --> 01:58:55,810
Would you say you have too much salt,
but do you find sodium in your blood?

2540
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:58,960
Like what is he saying?
Like my blood sugar was getting high.

2541
01:58:58,990 --> 01:59:00,730
What a fucking asshole.
This.

2542
01:59:01,010 --> 01:59:06,010
It's proven.
There's not a connection and this idiot 

2543
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:09,361
is telling you to cut back the salt.
How the fuck you supposed to trust 

2544
01:59:09,361 --> 01:59:12,481
doctors when they're going to buy some 
shit that they went to school with the 

2545
01:59:12,481 --> 01:59:12,481
nitrogen in it.
But that's my point.

2546
01:59:12,481 --> 01:59:13,770
You can't trust anybody.
Everybody's.

2547
01:59:13,890 --> 01:59:18,890
If a doctor physician dot your age.
That motherfucker was in college in the 

2548
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:19,390
eighties.
Right?

2549
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:22,570
So what the fuck?
That's a long goddamn time ago.

2550
01:59:22,630 --> 01:59:24,170
Today.
He was taught to shoot the,

2551
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,320
you know,
10 years after the seventies,

2552
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:28,090
people were idiots.
There were monkeys.

2553
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:32,050
They had fucking bell bottoms on.
People were barely out of the caves.

2554
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:33,610
Listen,
if I'm in the 19 seventies.

2555
01:59:33,611 --> 01:59:33,730
Yeah,

2556
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:35,960
if you committed to be a doctor,
right?

2557
01:59:36,020 --> 01:59:37,700
And you learned everything that you 
learned,

2558
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:44,170
your,
your whole identity is being based on 

2559
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:44,210
what you know.
Right?

2560
01:59:44,630 --> 01:59:49,630
So if some new new shit comes up or if 
you find out that something that you 

2561
01:59:50,511 --> 01:59:53,390
were taught that's embedded in you is 
not true,

2562
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:58,480
yeah,
then you're going to fight that new 

2563
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,461
truth and stick to the,
to the old way because that fucks with 

2564
02:00:00,461 --> 02:00:03,710
your identity and who you are and how 
people perceive you to be.

2565
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:06,060
There's also like peripheral knowledge 
that people have.

2566
02:00:06,061 --> 02:00:07,590
And I'm guilty of this too.
Everybody is,

2567
02:00:07,591 --> 02:00:09,870
I guess,
but I'm guilty of it especially like you

2568
02:00:09,871 --> 02:00:11,910
get a little peripheral knowledge of 
something that you think,

2569
02:00:11,911 --> 02:00:13,170
you know,
you understand what it is.

2570
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:17,560
Like I was talking to a scientist and 
actual scientist and uh,

2571
02:00:17,561 --> 02:00:19,000
I was talking about eggs,
you know,

2572
02:00:19,070 --> 02:00:19,860
we were talking about,
oh,

2573
02:00:19,861 --> 02:00:21,420
that's gotta be fun growing your own 
chickens.

2574
02:00:21,690 --> 02:00:22,350
And he goes,
well,

2575
02:00:22,351 --> 02:00:23,870
what about the cholesterol doesn't end,
uh,

2576
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:25,350
you know,
lead to high blood pressure.

2577
02:00:25,351 --> 02:00:26,760
You're taking in all that cholesterol.
I'm like,

2578
02:00:26,761 --> 02:00:28,950
Jesus Christ,
you're a fucking scientists.

2579
02:00:28,951 --> 02:00:31,650
Don't you understand that dietary 
cholesterol doesn't even.

2580
02:00:31,890 --> 02:00:35,160
It barely even moves the needle on blood
lipids.

2581
02:00:35,161 --> 02:00:39,390
Like there's a lot of sedentary 
lifestyle genetics.

2582
02:00:39,391 --> 02:00:41,700
There's all sorts of factors.
But like chickens,

2583
02:00:41,701 --> 02:00:44,610
like an eggs from chickens,
they're not bad for you at all.

2584
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:47,070
In fact,
one of the healthiest foods you can eat,

2585
02:00:47,310 --> 02:00:48,960
if you're seeing that chicken eggs are 
bad for you,

2586
02:00:48,961 --> 02:00:50,790
you're essentially saying that food is 
bad for you.

2587
02:00:50,870 --> 02:00:52,730
You don't want to see what the bad 
because they.

2588
02:00:53,190 --> 02:00:55,680
They shit all over eggs.
They're idiots.

2589
02:00:55,710 --> 02:00:59,820
They should all over the healthy grass 
fed chicken or a a free range.

2590
02:00:59,821 --> 02:01:02,160
Chicken is wandering around.
Look,

2591
02:01:02,250 --> 02:01:06,090
Google egg might be the perfect food.
There's an article about eggs,

2592
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:11,480
might be the perfect food because eggs 
have a ton of nutrients in them and 

2593
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:16,220
they're also essentially pretty ethical,
like ethically free of any reservations 

2594
02:01:16,220 --> 02:01:18,960
that chickens just lay eggs.
You don't have to hurt them.

2595
02:01:19,170 --> 02:01:21,180
Our eggs really?
Nature's perfect food.

2596
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:25,590
Rotten eggs.
How a perfect food can go bad.

2597
02:01:25,591 --> 02:01:26,970
What is this?
This,

2598
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:27,540
this,
this,

2599
02:01:27,541 --> 02:01:30,090
the same article I don't think it is.
There's.

2600
02:01:30,091 --> 02:01:35,091
There's an article.
It doesn't matter if there's an article 

2601
02:01:35,091 --> 02:01:35,310
that I read on how an egg is the perfect
food.

2602
02:01:35,311 --> 02:01:40,311
If you can find that.
It explains all the nutritional 

2603
02:01:40,311 --> 02:01:40,370
properties of egg.
They just

2604
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:43,320
so much shit from so many different 
styles.

2605
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:46,400
All I've learned to do is just trust 
myself.

2606
02:01:46,610 --> 02:01:49,370
So the doctor telling me this thing 
about salt,

2607
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:51,920
right?
Fucking 80 was kind of like,

2608
02:01:51,921 --> 02:01:53,780
all right,
I could feel something wrong,

2609
02:01:53,870 --> 02:01:55,430
right?
I could feel something wrong.

2610
02:01:55,431 --> 02:02:00,431
So that data honestly felt so when he 
said too much salt and then I know eaten

2611
02:02:01,490 --> 02:02:02,060
out a lot.

2612
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:07,820
Let me stop you.
When you said you could feel something 

2613
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:07,820
wrong,
like what are you talking about?

2614
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:07,820
Like what do you,
what are you experiencing?

2615
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:10,960
Uh,
it's just a feeling like,

2616
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:17,430
like in my veins or not,
I could just feel like I pay attention 

2617
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:18,850
to my body a lot.
You know,

2618
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:19,960
alone.
Naked.

2619
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:22,660
You don't know,
you're just after after I,

2620
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:24,150
after I ate.
Okay.

2621
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:28,690
I could feel something.
It wasn't in it and it was just,

2622
02:02:29,490 --> 02:02:30,440
just like,
this is,

2623
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:32,140
I'm not supposed to feel this way.

2624
02:02:32,270 --> 02:02:33,830
And this was just from eating food.

2625
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:36,100
Mostly.
Mostly

2626
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:39,340
there are,
could feel this is carbo big fat snake.

2627
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:41,940
Ribeye.
Fucking I don't,

2628
02:02:42,250 --> 02:02:44,710
I don't want to stay if I want some.
I want some elk.

2629
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:45,790
I want some elk.
Homie.

2630
02:02:45,820 --> 02:02:46,800
What'd you eat?
Yeah,

2631
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:50,250
told you I would because it's free 
range.

2632
02:02:50,290 --> 02:02:55,290
That's truly free range.
That's just free range to get the new 

2633
02:02:55,290 --> 02:02:55,290
place.
When we have a new place set up,

2634
02:02:55,290 --> 02:02:58,150
I'm going to have one of these.
I'm a yoder grills,

2635
02:02:58,510 --> 02:03:01,900
like I want us pellet grills there.
I'm going to be able to grill on a spot.

2636
02:03:02,170 --> 02:03:07,170
We will document document in Edwards.
First meat consumption and how many 

2637
02:03:07,810 --> 02:03:09,970
years will it be?
Over 10 for sure.

2638
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,120
Wow.
Ten over 10 to do.

2639
02:03:13,121 --> 02:03:15,820
You might go crazy.
You might become a hunter is going to be

2640
02:03:16,150 --> 02:03:21,150
shooting shit off the roof.
Was fucking rearrange people.

2641
02:03:23,140 --> 02:03:24,550
Is that it?
Whole eggs are mostly.

2642
02:03:24,610 --> 02:03:29,610
That is it.
Whole eggs are amongst the most 

2643
02:03:29,610 --> 02:03:32,880
abundant,
the most nutritious foods on earth and 

2644
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:35,671
so it made that a little larger there,
so you can see one egg contains vitamin 

2645
02:03:35,671 --> 02:03:35,671
B,
12,

2646
02:03:35,671 --> 02:03:37,030
nine percent of the RDA,
vitamin B,

2647
02:03:37,031 --> 02:03:38,020
two,
Riboflavin,

2648
02:03:38,021 --> 02:03:41,770
15 percent of the rda of vitamin A,
six percent,

2649
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:43,000
vitamin B,
five,

2650
02:03:43,001 --> 02:03:46,060
seven percent a selenium,
which is an important mineral.

2651
02:03:46,061 --> 02:03:51,061
Twenty two percent of the rda eggs also 
contains small amounts of almost every 

2652
02:03:51,061 --> 02:03:53,080
vitamin and mineral required by the 
human body,

2653
02:03:53,081 --> 02:03:54,640
including calcium,
iron,

2654
02:03:54,850 --> 02:03:56,080
potassium,
zinc,

2655
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:59,020
a Maganini.
I don't know what that is.

2656
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:03,310
Manganese,
vitamin e full and many more.

2657
02:04:03,311 --> 02:04:08,290
A large egg contains 77 calories with 
six grams of quality protein,

2658
02:04:08,291 --> 02:04:11,470
five grams of fat and trace amounts of 
carbohydrates.

2659
02:04:11,471 --> 02:04:16,471
It's very important to realize that 
almost all the nutrients are contained 

2660
02:04:16,471 --> 02:04:16,471
in the yolk.

2661
02:04:16,471 --> 02:04:19,390
While the white contains only protein.
It's a fantastic food source,

2662
02:04:19,630 --> 02:04:20,850
and here's the thing about eggs,
man,

2663
02:04:20,851 --> 02:04:23,260
it doesn't hurt the chickens.
You're not hurting anything.

2664
02:04:23,261 --> 02:04:25,840
You're not harming anything.
If you have free range chickens,

2665
02:04:25,841 --> 02:04:27,670
you could just,
and I know a lot of people can't,

2666
02:04:27,790 --> 02:04:31,240
but know what,
if people buy actual free range chickens

2667
02:04:31,900 --> 02:04:36,900
or buy free range chicken eggs,
you're buying eggs from an animal that 

2668
02:04:36,900 --> 02:04:38,970
just going to lay every day or every 
other day.

2669
02:04:39,210 --> 02:04:40,890
It's not.
They don't get hurt.

2670
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:46,130
And if you could figure out a way,
like the ideal thing would be like 

2671
02:04:46,130 --> 02:04:49,521
communities having like co-ops,
we grow your own vegetables and you guys

2672
02:04:49,651 --> 02:04:54,651
have like a chicken coop that everybody 
kind of helps take care of and these 

2673
02:04:54,651 --> 02:04:57,810
chickens roam around and eat bugs and 
worms and all the stuff they're supposed

2674
02:04:57,811 --> 02:05:02,811
to do.
And then you eat those chicken eggs and 

2675
02:05:02,811 --> 02:05:03,930
it's like you get animal protein but you
don't have to hurt anything.

2676
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:08,960
Nothing else to die.
And if you're getting a free range of 

2677
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:09,030
truly free range chicken,
egg,

2678
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:14,270
it's super healthy and to SSA anything.
Otherwise I have to stop and now I can't

2679
02:05:15,301 --> 02:05:17,490
watch your show.
I can't watch your movie.

2680
02:05:17,491 --> 02:05:22,491
I can't listen to you talk because 
you're not being honest like no one's 

2681
02:05:22,491 --> 02:05:22,491
saying vegetables aren't honest.
There are.

2682
02:05:22,491 --> 02:05:24,900
Or a healthy rather.
Vegetables are super.

2683
02:05:25,330 --> 02:05:28,440
Beets are fantastic for you.
Kayla is amazing for you.

2684
02:05:28,441 --> 02:05:30,270
Carrots,
onions,

2685
02:05:30,271 --> 02:05:32,400
all these different things that come out
of the ground.

2686
02:05:32,401 --> 02:05:33,830
Yams,
sweet potatoes also.

2687
02:05:33,890 --> 02:05:35,940
Fantastic for you.
Nutrients.

2688
02:05:35,941 --> 02:05:37,160
It's all important.
That's where what's.

2689
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:38,700
That's real food.
But.

2690
02:05:38,701 --> 02:05:40,890
So eggs,
nothing wrong with eating eggs.

2691
02:05:40,970 --> 02:05:44,660
Like my issue was I was just being a bad
vegan because you can be vegan and still

2692
02:05:44,690 --> 02:05:45,950
eat a lot of crap.
Yeah.

2693
02:05:46,370 --> 02:05:50,510
So and then like years of just eaten 
crap is definitely gonna Affect you.

2694
02:05:50,511 --> 02:05:51,740
No matter.
Like,

2695
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:56,830
like when somebody says to Vegan like 
what are you eating because you could 

2696
02:05:56,830 --> 02:05:57,110
eat bad shit.
Oh yeah.

2697
02:05:57,140 --> 02:06:01,280
So I just needed to cut back on the bad 
shit,

2698
02:06:01,730 --> 02:06:02,780
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

2699
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:07,870
Like stuff with sugar,
like the Vegan ice creams and just a 

2700
02:06:08,061 --> 02:06:10,340
bunch of shit.
And so now I can,

2701
02:06:10,370 --> 02:06:15,370
I feel better.
It's like the feeling that you were 

2702
02:06:15,370 --> 02:06:18,341
asking me about before.
It's almost like when you have a 

2703
02:06:18,341 --> 02:06:20,981
headache but your headache is in your 
body and most of the time I could 

2704
02:06:20,981 --> 02:06:22,580
correlate it with when I was eating and 
what I was eating.

2705
02:06:22,970 --> 02:06:24,930
So then now just like,
all right,

2706
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:29,160
you've been eating some crap.
Like I think sodium is good,

2707
02:06:29,180 --> 02:06:34,180
salt is good for you,
but if you probably take too much it is 

2708
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:34,180
bad.

2709
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:38,710
Let me stop you again because when 
you're telling me you're getting blood 

2710
02:06:38,710 --> 02:06:41,231
work done,
you're getting your blood work done to 

2711
02:06:41,231 --> 02:06:41,231
check to see if you have high blood 
pressure.

2712
02:06:41,231 --> 02:06:44,890
You're not getting your blood work done 
while you're checking nutritional 

2713
02:06:44,890 --> 02:06:44,890
levels.

2714
02:06:44,890 --> 02:06:44,890
I think they will checking for 
everything,

2715
02:06:44,890 --> 02:06:48,600
but did they tell you you need more 
vitamin B or Vitamin D or b,

2716
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:51,180
12 or anything like that.
They took Niacin.

2717
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:52,350
They never said that.
I got to call them.

2718
02:06:52,351 --> 02:06:57,351
I've got to call them a real.
A doctor that's going to do a real 

2719
02:06:57,351 --> 02:07:00,480
nutritional profile of you is going to 
concentrate on your nutrient intake,

2720
02:07:00,690 --> 02:07:05,690
is going to look at like tell you to eat
normal and then come in and do some 

2721
02:07:05,690 --> 02:07:09,321
blood work and then maybe they do it 
again in like six weeks or something 

2722
02:07:09,321 --> 02:07:09,321
like that and they're going to check a 
bunch of different things in.

2723
02:07:09,321 --> 02:07:12,000
Check your,
your hormone levels active,

2724
02:07:12,020 --> 02:07:14,790
a usable testosterone,
bunch of different things,

2725
02:07:14,970 --> 02:07:18,300
but it's really important is checking 
your vitamin levels,

2726
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:23,600
making sure that you really like this.
People have this weird idea that you get

2727
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:26,730
everything you need from your diet.
You might,

2728
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:29,610
you might get everything you need from 
your diet depending on your hands,

2729
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:34,730
on your diet,
and also depends on whether or not 

2730
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:34,730
you've checked.

2731
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:36,400
Most people haven't checked or you don't
go to a doctor and check,

2732
02:07:36,401 --> 02:07:40,150
go get yourself checked out.
Find out like your nutrient levels,

2733
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:43,330
find out what maybe you need some 
vitamin D,

2734
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:48,360
maybe it needs some b12 or b six.
Maybe they can find that your body is 

2735
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:52,560
low on Niacin or maybe they think that 
consuming more essential fatty acids.

2736
02:07:52,841 --> 02:07:56,050
It'd be very good for you,
but you can go to a really good doctor,

2737
02:07:56,340 --> 02:08:01,340
a legit doctor that goes over that stuff
and is on the cutting edge of today's 

2738
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:05,731
modern science and they can greatly 
enhance your ability to understand what 

2739
02:08:06,581 --> 02:08:11,581
impact your diet is having my body,
because if you think you're eating 

2740
02:08:11,581 --> 02:08:14,401
healthy and then they do like a 
triglyceride count on you and they do 

2741
02:08:14,401 --> 02:08:15,360
your blood sugar count.
Like Sam Harris.

2742
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:20,420
A friend of mine just started.
He tried to be Vegan for a little while 

2743
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:20,420
and his.

2744
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:24,220
He got his blood work done like on a 
regular basis because he's smart guy and

2745
02:08:24,221 --> 02:08:26,070
wants to check his body out and he was 
like,

2746
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:26,950
dude,
it's not good.

2747
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:31,980
Like there's too much sugar.
The glucose levels is a bunch of 

2748
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:33,310
different factors and forget like what 
particular was,

2749
02:08:33,311 --> 02:08:36,610
but he had to switch to eating a wild 
fish,

2750
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:40,080
wild fish and then mostly Vegan.
Other than that,

2751
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,590
cut out the dairy,
cut out the factory.

2752
02:08:41,591 --> 02:08:42,700
Farming.
Figured it out.

2753
02:08:43,270 --> 02:08:48,270
I mean,
I just think that there's a lot of bad 

2754
02:08:48,270 --> 02:08:53,190
in modern diets.
There's a lot of bad in food 

2755
02:08:53,190 --> 02:08:53,890
consumption.
We don't need to make stuff up.

2756
02:08:54,190 --> 02:08:59,190
We need to find out who's telling the 
truth and the doctor telling you that 

2757
02:08:59,190 --> 02:09:01,891
you need to cut your salt back and 
that's what's giving you high blood 

2758
02:09:01,891 --> 02:09:01,891
pressure.
That guy's an asshole.

2759
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:06,900
He's an asshole.
Whether he realizes he's an asshole or 

2760
02:09:06,900 --> 02:09:09,841
not,
he's not paying attention to the latest 

2761
02:09:09,841 --> 02:09:09,841
shit.
He some dude,

2762
02:09:09,841 --> 02:09:09,841
it's probably

2763
02:09:09,841 --> 02:09:13,750
going or he's just a doctor.
Trust me.

2764
02:09:13,751 --> 02:09:16,960
I don't trust doctors per se.
You know what I'm saying?

2765
02:09:16,961 --> 02:09:18,880
Yeah.
Because a lot of them,

2766
02:09:18,970 --> 02:09:21,430
you know,
like everything else,

2767
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:26,560
they like everything else.
It's like trusting a comedian to be 

2768
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:26,560
funny.
We all know someone,

2769
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:27,610
some of them that just.
There's never going to happen.

2770
02:09:27,611 --> 02:09:29,530
Exactly.
And they called themselves can be.

2771
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:31,810
Or even if they often they're being be 
in the audience has no.

2772
02:09:31,811 --> 02:09:33,690
They got that shit from somewhere else.
That's true too.

2773
02:09:33,750 --> 02:09:38,750
Yeah.
So there's a lot of hacky doctors out 

2774
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:38,750
there.
Just bad doctors,

2775
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:39,170
man.
There's a lot of really good ones.

2776
02:09:39,370 --> 02:09:40,090
Good ones too.
Yeah.

2777
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:41,020
It's really good ones.
Yeah.

2778
02:09:41,021 --> 02:09:42,250
You just have to find them.
How old you?

2779
02:09:42,251 --> 02:09:45,970
Dr.
He must have been like maybe around 50.

2780
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:46,720
Fuck him.

2781
02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:54,660
I hope he's on a treadmill right now and
he hears this so it just start googling.

2782
02:09:54,690 --> 02:09:55,450
Yeah.
Hypertension.

2783
02:09:55,490 --> 02:09:58,200
I don't know if he looked like he 
doesn't google.

2784
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:03,320
No,
I don't think he like just drank some 

2785
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:03,320
know.
What is this?

2786
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:05,250
If you have high blood pressure,
salt still matters.

2787
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:07,890
New Research examines these sodium 
hypertension.

2788
02:10:07,891 --> 02:10:11,960
Mystery.
What does it say in comes from?

2789
02:10:12,210 --> 02:10:16,640
So if you have high blood pressure,
salt matters receptor that are.

2790
02:10:17,700 --> 02:10:18,720
Okay.
What does it say?

2791
02:10:18,721 --> 02:10:22,590
Her articles and yourselves and kidneys 
continue continuously.

2792
02:10:22,591 --> 02:10:24,000
Where's this coming from?
First of all,

2793
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:28,630
and this is an actual study goes well,
I don't like that to face.

2794
02:10:29,370 --> 02:10:33,470
We recently discovered a possible 
explanation team study the hormone.

2795
02:10:33,530 --> 02:10:38,530
Angiotensin angiotensin helps regulate 
your blood pressure when it binds to a 

2796
02:10:39,351 --> 02:10:44,070
receptor called [inaudible] are and 
turns it on the 81.

2797
02:10:44,150 --> 02:10:49,150
Our molecules in your cells of your 
kidneys continuously regulate the levels

2798
02:10:49,311 --> 02:10:54,311
of sodium in the blood.
This relationship can be overactive in 

2799
02:10:54,311 --> 02:10:54,380
some people,
which leads to high blood pressure.

2800
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:59,360
There's hope in the forms of a drug 
called 81 are blockers,

2801
02:10:59,860 --> 02:11:02,840
a true to their name.
These drugs block Ngo,

2802
02:11:03,860 --> 02:11:08,860
angiotensin from binding with our 
thereby keeping blood pressure lower to 

2803
02:11:09,321 --> 02:11:14,321
make these drugs even more effective.
Researchers want to understand the 

2804
02:11:14,321 --> 02:11:14,321
molecular structure of 81 arm.

2805
02:11:14,670 --> 02:11:17,570
Okay,
so this is still important.

2806
02:11:17,571 --> 02:11:20,400
It's not a,
it's not the number one thing.

2807
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:22,960
So it's not giving it to you,
but if you have it,

2808
02:11:22,961 --> 02:11:24,550
it may be a factor.
Correct.

2809
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:27,360
So if you wonder what their levels are 
they're talking about.

2810
02:11:27,910 --> 02:11:29,430
So like when you're talking about the 
levels that didn't,

2811
02:11:29,431 --> 02:11:34,431
that test when they were given it to 
rats and you give it 500 grams off song 

2812
02:11:34,431 --> 02:11:34,431
wrap.
Yeah,

2813
02:11:34,431 --> 02:11:36,000
you definitely die from eating that 
much.

2814
02:11:36,090 --> 02:11:41,090
So I think that we just need more 
transparency and honesty and it comes to

2815
02:11:43,021 --> 02:11:46,560
what people actually know versus what 
they're claiming to know.

2816
02:11:46,890 --> 02:11:49,440
You know when you're talking to a doctor
that's giving you shit advice.

2817
02:11:49,441 --> 02:11:50,290
Like I've,
I've talked to,

2818
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:55,640
I've talked to a ton of doctors and say 
like you can get everything you want 

2819
02:11:55,640 --> 02:11:55,920
from the average American diet.
There's no need to take vitamins.

2820
02:11:55,921 --> 02:11:58,260
Your pm out.
That's straight up.

2821
02:11:58,730 --> 02:12:01,740
Shit.
I'll take b a to k,

2822
02:12:02,310 --> 02:12:04,890
take be twelfth.
If you take [inaudible] you know,

2823
02:12:04,891 --> 02:12:08,310
you're probably not really vague and 
fuck it.

2824
02:12:09,410 --> 02:12:11,760
I'm trying to be,
I'm trying to be healthy.

2825
02:12:12,180 --> 02:12:17,180
I guess.
I don't care where it comes from them 

2826
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:17,180
this as long as a good sauce,
I don't feel good.

2827
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:17,880
Baby eyelids.
Hey man,

2828
02:12:17,940 --> 02:12:19,680
babies should have defended themselves.

2829
02:12:21,990 --> 02:12:24,580
Those babies are here for a purpose.
Like what do you,

2830
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:29,650
do you have like a main staple like a 
that you like say if you're at home and 

2831
02:12:29,650 --> 02:12:33,021
you cook it,
is there like a main thing that you 

2832
02:12:33,021 --> 02:12:33,021
utilize?
Like wild rice,

2833
02:12:33,021 --> 02:12:35,430
wild rice or pasta?
Chemo was great and uh,

2834
02:12:35,610 --> 02:12:40,610
Chemo.
Chemo is one of those rare plants that 

2835
02:12:40,610 --> 02:12:40,610
as like a full amino acid profile.
Right?

2836
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:43,800
It's like hemp and a few other ones.
Yeah.

2837
02:12:43,801 --> 02:12:45,390
There's,
there's a few of those,

2838
02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:47,830
a protein rich plants,
like,

2839
02:12:48,030 --> 02:12:51,150
like some plants that have good amount 
of protein in them.

2840
02:12:51,210 --> 02:12:53,110
I put hemp seeds in my,
in my,

2841
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:54,960
in my smoothies.
That's good.

2842
02:12:55,260 --> 02:12:58,010
And Chia seeds.
Chia seeds are great too.

2843
02:12:58,050 --> 02:13:00,360
Yeah.
That also cleans your pipes out.

2844
02:13:00,390 --> 02:13:01,830
You know what I'm saying?
Whoa.

2845
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,580
I put Kale in them so I,
you know.

2846
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:06,750
Do you use coconut oil at all?

2847
02:13:06,910 --> 02:13:10,080
Yeah,
Cook with it or use it for other shit.

2848
02:13:10,140 --> 02:13:12,750
It's good to add.
Like if you make smoothies and shit like

2849
02:13:12,751 --> 02:13:17,751
that,
it's good to add because the Fascia put 

2850
02:13:17,751 --> 02:13:17,751
something in there and helps the 
absorption of the vitamins.

2851
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:20,780
I had to learn that one the hard way.
Not the meat.

2852
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:25,860
This adding mct oil to a shakes makes it
just makes it more nutritious,

2853
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,910
but you've got to be careful because you
will shit yourself.

2854
02:13:30,210 --> 02:13:31,560
You have to be careful.
You can't,

2855
02:13:31,590 --> 02:13:36,000
you can't go too hard with the mct oil 
or you can get like a few tablespoons in

2856
02:13:36,001 --> 02:13:39,210
a big glass of,
but anything more than that,

2857
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:44,240
it's just something about it.
Your body's like just released the 

2858
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:44,240
house,
like your,

2859
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:46,180
your,
your intestines.

2860
02:13:46,230 --> 02:13:51,230
A little bit,
but I think it feels like more than 

2861
02:13:51,230 --> 02:13:51,230
that.
It almost feels.

2862
02:13:51,230 --> 02:13:51,840
It's not just like lube.
It's almost like your body's like,

2863
02:13:51,850 --> 02:13:54,050
what are you like,
ah,

2864
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:56,070
too much shot him.
I'm not comfortable with this.

2865
02:13:56,071 --> 02:13:57,360
Let's go.
Let's go.

2866
02:13:57,390 --> 02:13:58,260
Let's go.
Everybody out.

2867
02:13:58,410 --> 02:14:00,840
Woo.
Yeah.

2868
02:14:01,630 --> 02:14:06,630
Just nothing like diarrhea that changed 
your mind on things like if you had all 

2869
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:07,020
the money in the world,
but constant diarrhea,

2870
02:14:07,470 --> 02:14:10,170
diarrhea forever.
You could live like p diddy,

2871
02:14:10,530 --> 02:14:13,950
like two bottles of champagne,
one in each hand on a yacht,

2872
02:14:14,010 --> 02:14:16,320
but at any moment you could shoot 
yourself.

2873
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:21,090
That's not live.
It's not live.

2874
02:14:21,091 --> 02:14:23,040
It's not.
Nobody can accept that.

2875
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:29,900
Yeah.
If you're on that yacht because you pay 

2876
02:14:30,181 --> 02:14:32,520
some friends and hilarious and he was 
like,

2877
02:14:32,521 --> 02:14:33,600
listen,
I'm rich.

2878
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:37,710
We can hang out.
But occasionally I might shit myself and

2879
02:14:37,711 --> 02:14:39,150
know snickering.
Yeah,

2880
02:14:39,151 --> 02:14:44,151
you can't laugh at me man.
Running down as Miami vice shoes.

2881
02:14:44,580 --> 02:14:46,740
He's got those shoes.
No socks on.

2882
02:14:46,741 --> 02:14:51,330
Those white loafers dudes wearing shit.
Dribbling down or you have to wear those

2883
02:14:51,331 --> 02:14:52,550
diapers.
Yeah,

2884
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:54,400
you'd have to wear the diaper.
But then everybody smells it.

2885
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:57,630
The of the baby around me.
Oh,

2886
02:14:57,631 --> 02:15:01,100
what's good with dog?
And keep up the old dog shit.

2887
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:02,340
So I was like,
what?

2888
02:15:02,341 --> 02:15:04,890
Come on baby.
It's not going to go change this baby.

2889
02:15:05,420 --> 02:15:08,610
Oh yeah.
If you have constant diarrhea,

2890
02:15:08,611 --> 02:15:10,770
that feeling that the only thing that 
makes diarrhea,

2891
02:15:10,771 --> 02:15:13,410
okay is that you know it's eventually 
going to go away.

2892
02:15:14,180 --> 02:15:19,180
Right?
Because if you just had to live forever 

2893
02:15:19,180 --> 02:15:19,350
knowing at any moment you could just 
shit yourself.

2894
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:21,660
There's a lot of people that that's the 
reality,

2895
02:15:21,670 --> 02:15:26,670
right?
People with Crohn's disease and shit 

2896
02:15:26,670 --> 02:15:28,791
like that,
they're like constantly shitting 

2897
02:15:28,791 --> 02:15:30,890
themselves.
That's where like butt wipes are very 

2898
02:15:30,890 --> 02:15:34,401
important.
You can't be using like some cheap ass 

2899
02:15:34,401 --> 02:15:37,670
costco toilet paper.
What's the thing where you just fall 

2900
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:37,670
asleep?
Automatically?

2901
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:39,480
Narcolepsy.
It's like narcolepsy of the ass.

2902
02:15:41,420 --> 02:15:46,420
Controlling what if you had bolt just 
fall down all the time whenever you had 

2903
02:15:47,031 --> 02:15:47,430
to.
Shit.

2904
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:52,040
Fall Asleep and that would be what would
happen.

2905
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:54,420
You would have these ideas and shit,
man.

2906
02:15:54,421 --> 02:15:57,150
I just think I probably should get 
through the fall asleep.

2907
02:15:57,390 --> 02:15:58,650
Wake up coverage.
Shit.

2908
02:15:58,680 --> 02:16:03,680
What the fuck?
It's like your body's trying to protect 

2909
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:03,680
you from the fact that it knows you're 
going to shit yourself,

2910
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:05,280
knows you can handle it.

2911
02:16:05,550 --> 02:16:08,340
It's like some drunks become blackout 
drunks.

2912
02:16:08,341 --> 02:16:10,830
I think it drunk so hard so often their 
bodies like,

2913
02:16:10,831 --> 02:16:12,570
look,
we can't handle this.

2914
02:16:12,571 --> 02:16:14,550
It's still be conscious if you're going 
to continue to do this,

2915
02:16:14,551 --> 02:16:18,170
we're just gonna start blocking out 
various.

2916
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:23,720
When you wake up,
everybody's gone and you could just get 

2917
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:23,720
up and crawl home.
Yeah.

2918
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:25,890
You just covered in without being 
embarrassed every time you like,

2919
02:16:25,950 --> 02:16:30,950
you're in the middle of your kitchen.
I don't know if I'm going to make it to 

2920
02:16:30,950 --> 02:16:33,711
the don't fall down.
Greg invited us over for dinner,

2921
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,770
but uh,
he shits himself a lot.

2922
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:38,670
Do you want to go to Greg's house is to 
eat.

2923
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:42,310
Greg shows up.
He could hear mostly his diaper.

2924
02:16:42,430 --> 02:16:47,430
Franklin sits down if you're a 
narcoleptic,

2925
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:55,560
like what's to stop you from banging 
your fucking head off the ground and 

2926
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:56,290
that's a problem.
That's the scary part,

2927
02:16:56,291 --> 02:16:56,590
right?

2928
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:58,000
The machine.
Someone Faint?

2929
02:16:58,620 --> 02:16:59,280
Uh,
yeah.

2930
02:16:59,290 --> 02:17:00,220
Yeah,
I know weird.

2931
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:03,130
I've known people that have epileptic 
seizures.

2932
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:08,460
We don't know when those are going to 
happen and you have to like stop them 

2933
02:17:08,460 --> 02:17:10,540
from hurting themselves.
I've seen that on a plane.

2934
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:12,960
Sorry.
The lady behind us just locked up,

2935
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:19,050
thought she was just locked up.
Like her body just was like,

2936
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:24,680
it wasn't working and she was trying to 
fight it off and then they tried to like

2937
02:17:25,060 --> 02:17:30,060
calm her down and I think they tried to 
get her to stop from swallowing or 

2938
02:17:30,060 --> 02:17:34,711
tongue.
I don't know how they did they have to 

2939
02:17:34,711 --> 02:17:34,711
do that.
Boom.

2940
02:17:34,711 --> 02:17:34,711
There was a bunch of people that's 
around.

2941
02:17:34,711 --> 02:17:37,560
She was like a couple rows behind me.
Bunch of people jumped on the situation.

2942
02:17:37,570 --> 02:17:38,860
You stopped him from biting their 
tongue.

2943
02:17:39,050 --> 02:17:40,380
Swallowing,
yeah.

2944
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:41,690
Fuck.
And then,

2945
02:17:41,691 --> 02:17:45,430
uh,
it was like she locked up like you could

2946
02:17:45,431 --> 02:17:50,431
see like around people started,
like there was a commotion and turned 

2947
02:17:50,431 --> 02:17:54,001
around and was like,
almost like she was like wrestling with 

2948
02:17:54,001 --> 02:17:55,720
something which is probably what they 
used to think right back in the day when

2949
02:17:55,721 --> 02:18:00,721
someone,
they thought you were possessed by the 

2950
02:18:00,721 --> 02:18:00,721
devil.

2951
02:18:00,721 --> 02:18:00,721
Right?
Like if you believe in the devil,

2952
02:18:00,721 --> 02:18:03,790
he saw someone have a seizure like Satan
as her.

2953
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:08,960
Yeah.
I wonder if they even bothered fixing 

2954
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:08,960
people back then they might have just 
killed them,

2955
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:09,820
killed them,
or throw them in a dungeon.

2956
02:18:10,040 --> 02:18:15,040
Bright.
If you're having a fucking lockup 

2957
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:16,300
seizure during the inquisition,
they'd be sure there's the devil.

2958
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:19,180
The devil is taken over you.
Dude.

2959
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:25,770
That's the line that people don't like 
to cross the believing in the devil 

2960
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:25,770
line.
Right?

2961
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:26,860
Right.
What do you mean believing in it?

2962
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:28,930
Talking about it.
Talking about.

2963
02:18:28,931 --> 02:18:32,080
Talk about God all day.
As soon as you talk about the devil,

2964
02:18:32,130 --> 02:18:32,520
you know,
like,

2965
02:18:32,530 --> 02:18:35,200
oh boy,
like he crossed the line.

2966
02:18:35,230 --> 02:18:40,230
People are afraid of that,
but people talk about God keep be 

2967
02:18:40,230 --> 02:18:43,860
talking about God,
but you usually can't have one without 

2968
02:18:43,860 --> 02:18:43,860
the other.
The devil is in the Bible,

2969
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:44,670
so.

2970
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:49,950
Yeah,
but it shows this the slow cultural 

2971
02:18:49,950 --> 02:18:53,251
evolution that we were talking about.
We've realized how ridiculous it is to 

2972
02:18:53,251 --> 02:18:54,700
think that some dude in a fiery pit with
a pitchfork,

2973
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:56,980
unless you have one of the people that 
listens to this,

2974
02:18:57,580 --> 02:18:58,840
still believes in that.
That's fine.

2975
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:01,330
I'm not telling you right.
You might be right,

2976
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:04,870
but for most people that's pretty 
ridiculous,

2977
02:19:04,871 --> 02:19:06,220
right?
The.

2978
02:19:06,370 --> 02:19:06,760
Yeah,
that's.

2979
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:08,980
He's going to torture you in the fires 
of hell forever,

2980
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:14,020
but there's a lot of religious belief,
but it's a package deal.

2981
02:19:14,021 --> 02:19:19,021
See,
that's what I'm saying is it's a weird 

2982
02:19:19,021 --> 02:19:19,840
thing that will allow people to not 
follow the package.

2983
02:19:19,841 --> 02:19:21,280
Like you know,
you don't have to buy the wax.

2984
02:19:21,281 --> 02:19:23,560
You can just get the,
the armor,

2985
02:19:23,561 --> 02:19:27,040
all the tires and you don't have to get 
the wax part.

2986
02:19:27,050 --> 02:19:28,070
But this is where

2987
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:33,070
the devil comes in.
The devil comes in to help scare people 

2988
02:19:33,470 --> 02:19:38,470
into Christianity.
So if you're a preacher or a jail was 

2989
02:19:39,351 --> 02:19:42,140
witnessed,
what somebody like,

2990
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:46,190
if I'm going to scare you into being,
it's like scared straight.

2991
02:19:46,250 --> 02:19:48,590
If I'm going to scare you into being 
good,

2992
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:51,940
I gotta take you to prison so you could 
see what prisoners.

2993
02:19:51,980 --> 02:19:56,980
Like if I'm gonna.
Part of being a Christian is not just 

2994
02:19:56,980 --> 02:19:57,920
being good.
It's not.

2995
02:19:57,921 --> 02:20:02,921
You don't want to go to hell.
So I got to give you these stories of 

2996
02:20:02,921 --> 02:20:07,451
people in Hell and paint this picture so
that you make this choice that I want 

2997
02:20:08,091 --> 02:20:13,091
you to make.
So the devil is a very important thing 

2998
02:20:13,091 --> 02:20:14,210
in making people.
Christians

2999
02:20:14,290 --> 02:20:16,750
used to be.
But now things are getting more and more

3000
02:20:16,751 --> 02:20:21,751
slippery because it's more and more 
ridiculous because more and more people 

3001
02:20:21,751 --> 02:20:25,051
are making fun of Christianity.
So now it's like you don't bring up the 

3002
02:20:25,051 --> 02:20:25,051
devil,
right?

3003
02:20:25,051 --> 02:20:26,320
So like if the president could go on on 
television,

3004
02:20:26,321 --> 02:20:29,610
say God bless America,
we are a nation governed by God.

3005
02:20:29,630 --> 02:20:30,420
Everybody goes,
yeah,

3006
02:20:31,090 --> 02:20:33,250
but if he says we have located the 
devil,

3007
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:35,570
he's in Afghanistan.
We're sending troops to that area.

3008
02:20:35,571 --> 02:20:36,520
And people were like,
what?

3009
02:20:37,270 --> 02:20:39,580
What the fuck are you talking about?
Man?

3010
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:41,560
You can't say the devil is a real thing.

3011
02:20:41,770 --> 02:20:42,460
I know.
I know.

3012
02:20:42,490 --> 02:20:43,360
It's like a.

3013
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:46,700
The problem is the devil.
If trump got on TV,

3014
02:20:47,180 --> 02:20:52,180
sorry,
saying when I said grab them by the 

3015
02:20:52,180 --> 02:20:52,180
Pussy,
that was not me.

3016
02:20:52,180 --> 02:20:55,040
That was the devil speaking through me 
and now I understand and everybody would

3017
02:20:55,041 --> 02:21:00,041
clap.
The devil is in our heart and our soul 

3018
02:21:00,041 --> 02:21:03,221
and we need to stop him from ruining 
life on earth before Jesus returns and 

3019
02:21:03,441 --> 02:21:07,370
offers us eternal salvation.
Right?

3020
02:21:07,371 --> 02:21:12,371
You could.
You could almost imagine someone saying 

3021
02:21:12,371 --> 02:21:14,921
like that,
but not someone saying something like 

3022
02:21:14,921 --> 02:21:14,921
that,
but not quite.

3023
02:21:14,921 --> 02:21:18,550
They would like.
I always think like you ever seen those 

3024
02:21:18,550 --> 02:21:20,180
core cases where somebody said they 
heard voices.

3025
02:21:20,330 --> 02:21:21,890
Yes.
And then they killed somebody,

3026
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:22,640
right?
Right.

3027
02:21:23,080 --> 02:21:25,880
So that's a of schizophrenia.
So that person's on trial.

3028
02:21:26,150 --> 02:21:31,150
That person's on trial and then 
everybody's looking at that person like 

3029
02:21:31,150 --> 02:21:31,580
they're crazy.
Right?

3030
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:32,510
Right,
right.

3031
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:37,540
But before that,
the people who testified against that 

3032
02:21:37,540 --> 02:21:41,681
guy testified they have to put their 
hand on the Bible and swear to God that 

3033
02:21:41,681 --> 02:21:45,560
they can't see to give testimony that 
this person is crazy.

3034
02:21:46,010 --> 02:21:48,830
What is the difference?
He said he heard voices.

3035
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:51,380
Your swearing to something you can't 
see.

3036
02:21:51,410 --> 02:21:53,150
So help me God.
So help me God.

3037
02:21:53,151 --> 02:21:54,220
So yeah.
What?

3038
02:21:54,290 --> 02:21:55,370
What's the difference?

3039
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:55,920
Yeah,
you're,

3040
02:21:55,921 --> 02:22:00,921
you're,
you're swearing to an imaginary make 

3041
02:22:00,921 --> 02:22:00,921
believe person,
right?

3042
02:22:00,921 --> 02:22:02,850
That may or may not have created the 
entire universe and six days.

3043
02:22:03,140 --> 02:22:06,030
Okay?
So they might not be crazy,

3044
02:22:06,090 --> 02:22:07,260
but this guy's crazy.
Yeah.

3045
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:08,910
This guy's hearing voices to tell them 
to kill.

3046
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:11,460
Fall off from this guy or you.
Yeah.

3047
02:22:11,970 --> 02:22:13,680
Who Have you talked to?
God.

3048
02:22:13,890 --> 02:22:18,030
I have a personal relationship with God.
I talked to God every night.

3049
02:22:18,690 --> 02:22:20,730
That was the thing about Bush to use 
drive me crazy.

3050
02:22:20,731 --> 02:22:22,320
When you say talked to God,
like,

3051
02:22:22,321 --> 02:22:27,321
listen motherfucker,
you might be talking to Adam unless 

3052
02:22:27,321 --> 02:22:30,140
God's talking back.
You're not really having a conversation 

3053
02:22:30,140 --> 02:22:32,750
because people could be telling me,
I talked to Joe Rogan every night 

3054
02:22:32,750 --> 02:22:32,750
because you just,
you listening to the podcast goes,

3055
02:22:32,750 --> 02:22:34,150
shut the fuck up.
God Damn.

3056
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:36,570
You can tell that story again.
You're not really talking to me,

3057
02:22:36,571 --> 02:22:37,230
man.
Okay.

3058
02:22:37,231 --> 02:22:37,980
You're talking at me.

3059
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:42,980
I'm not there.
The last thing George did was talk to 

3060
02:22:42,980 --> 02:22:43,830
God every night.
The last thing he did,

3061
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:47,970
every evening I talked to God.
He gives me my plans.

3062
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,490
No,
I talked to Ian Edwards every evening.

3063
02:22:51,090 --> 02:22:53,430
I listened to his podcast about soccer.
Excuse me.

3064
02:22:53,431 --> 02:22:55,520
I mean football and I started screaming 
at them.

3065
02:22:56,250 --> 02:22:57,690
So there's.
Yeah,

3066
02:22:57,691 --> 02:23:02,691
you don't.
You don't hear too many people saying 

3067
02:23:02,691 --> 02:23:02,970
they actually heard from God because 
that's where it gets slippery.

3068
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:05,460
Like you could talk to God all crazy.
Yeah.

3069
02:23:05,461 --> 02:23:06,780
You sound like a nut.
Yeah.

3070
02:23:07,090 --> 02:23:12,090
Well,
I got a bit that I've been doing lately 

3071
02:23:12,090 --> 02:23:12,090
about how no one likes new miracles.
Yeah.

3072
02:23:12,090 --> 02:23:12,740
Yeah.
You know that.

3073
02:23:13,670 --> 02:23:16,050
I don't even know if I heard that bit,
but you're right.

3074
02:23:16,350 --> 02:23:21,350
It's like we like old man.
He believed the ones that happened in 

3075
02:23:21,350 --> 02:23:24,081
the Bible.
If somebody says this miracle happened 

3076
02:23:24,081 --> 02:23:24,081
to them,
they were crazy,

3077
02:23:24,081 --> 02:23:24,081
but don't you believe in God?

3078
02:23:24,081 --> 02:23:25,530
Well,
we'll get to like Joseph Smith,

3079
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:30,560
Joseph Smith.
That's the bounds of incredulity cause 

3080
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,230
that's the 18 hundreds.
I think it was 18,

3081
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:32,850
20.
Was it 18?

3082
02:23:32,860 --> 02:23:37,860
20.
He's found the golden tablets that 

3083
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:41,421
contained the work of the last work of 
Jesus and only he could read them 

3084
02:23:41,421 --> 02:23:43,350
because he had a magic seer stone that 
he would look through.

3085
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:49,080
The angels came and took it away.
Like all of it was like crazy miracle 

3086
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:52,311
stuff,
but it's all just long enough just long 

3087
02:23:52,311 --> 02:23:52,830
enough ago where people go,
oh,

3088
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:54,630
maybe it was still going on back then,
right?

3089
02:23:54,631 --> 02:23:55,050
Yeah,
yeah.

3090
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:57,870
Maybe,
but not in 2017.

3091
02:23:57,920 --> 02:23:58,620
No,
you can't come.

3092
02:23:58,621 --> 02:24:01,860
You can come with that unless you got 
some super proof.

3093
02:24:02,130 --> 02:24:07,130
But now people are not going to believe 
that super proof anymore because of all 

3094
02:24:07,130 --> 02:24:07,830
this three d rendering software and 
adobe photoshop.

3095
02:24:07,831 --> 02:24:09,210
And have you seen that thing?

3096
02:24:09,210 --> 02:24:11,730
We were talking about it yesterday.
They're able to,

3097
02:24:11,731 --> 02:24:16,731
uh,
you could talk for 20 minutes and 

3098
02:24:16,731 --> 02:24:19,191
they'll take your voice and you 
essentially over 20 minutes they find 

3099
02:24:19,191 --> 02:24:23,750
everything you've ever said,
all the noises that you can make in 20 

3100
02:24:23,750 --> 02:24:24,120
minutes or 40 minutes,
40 minutes.

3101
02:24:24,121 --> 02:24:26,160
Actually they could do it in 20,
but they prefer 40.

3102
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:30,270
So they could make you say words you've 
never said before.

3103
02:24:30,390 --> 02:24:32,250
Like you could say,
uh,

3104
02:24:32,310 --> 02:24:33,420
hey,
joe and Jamie,

3105
02:24:33,450 --> 02:24:35,910
let's do a podcast.
And they could say,

3106
02:24:35,911 --> 02:24:40,911
hey,
Joe and Jamie and Mike and Steve and 

3107
02:24:40,911 --> 02:24:40,911
Debbie,
let's do a podcast.

3108
02:24:40,911 --> 02:24:41,070
And he'd be like,
what the fuck?

3109
02:24:41,071 --> 02:24:42,450
I never said Mike and Steven,
Debbie,

3110
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:45,830
they can make your voice say those 
things with,

3111
02:24:45,950 --> 02:24:48,060
with new computer software and they 
can't.

3112
02:24:48,150 --> 02:24:50,310
So what evidence is evidence now in 
court?

3113
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:55,400
That's the point.
The point is it's getting so close to 

3114
02:24:55,400 --> 02:24:56,340
being impossible to tell.
If something's fake.

3115
02:24:56,490 --> 02:24:58,230
Like right now,
they can still kind of tell,

3116
02:24:58,290 --> 02:25:03,290
like still a little clunky,
but it's a few years away from being 

3117
02:25:03,290 --> 02:25:04,620
indiscernible you're not going to be 
able to tell me,

3118
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:06,600
get manufacturer anything.
Yeah,

3119
02:25:07,260 --> 02:25:08,170
it's crazy.
It's,

3120
02:25:08,220 --> 02:25:13,220
it's really,
it's going to be really interesting 

3121
02:25:13,220 --> 02:25:15,260
because they're also going to be able to
have people like you won't have to like 

3122
02:25:15,260 --> 02:25:17,610
bring John Wayne back to life to have a 
John Wayne movie.

3123
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:23,000
You could have a fake John Wayne.
You have hours and hours of John Wayne 

3124
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:23,000
talking.
You take that,

3125
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:24,130
you throw it into a computer

3126
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:29,430
and it can.
You could write a script like you could 

3127
02:25:29,430 --> 02:25:31,660
write a script or John Wayne is in some 
new high tech Western movie.

3128
02:25:31,910 --> 02:25:36,910
Didn't they make a star wars rogue one?
Did they do some shit like that?

3129
02:25:38,260 --> 02:25:41,450
They added a princess Leia in it.
She was after she was dead.

3130
02:25:41,490 --> 02:25:45,050
She was and they made her younger than 
she already was one of the guys.

3131
02:25:45,051 --> 02:25:48,500
The admiral.
Was it good alert by the way,

3132
02:25:48,810 --> 02:25:52,370
a son of a bitch.
I haven't even seen that movie bad since

3133
02:25:52,371 --> 02:25:52,700
Christmas.

3134
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:57,810
Have you guys been paying attention to 
all this shit stirring that William 

3135
02:25:57,810 --> 02:26:01,380
Shatner has been doing online.
William Shatner is is at war with social

3136
02:26:01,541 --> 02:26:04,480
justice warriors on twitter.
William Shatner.

3137
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:09,600
He's like shit.
Posting online and getting these people 

3138
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:12,691
mad at him and they're mad and they're 
saying that your whole show star track 

3139
02:26:12,691 --> 02:26:16,960
was about social justice and here you 
are mocking social justice warriors.

3140
02:26:17,110 --> 02:26:20,770
There was an article in huff post which 
is like the Super Liberal Rag,

3141
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:25,940
like should William Shatner's like 
abhorrent behavior or something like 

3142
02:26:25,940 --> 02:26:27,010
that.
I have a race abberant,

3143
02:26:27,310 --> 02:26:32,310
a racist star trek legacy like that,
like literally bad behavior online.

3144
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:34,600
Find that article because it's so 
ridiculous.

3145
02:26:34,900 --> 02:26:39,900
But he's essentially.
I'm just fucking with people call them 

3146
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:41,260
snowflakes and shit and people going 
nuts.

3147
02:26:41,890 --> 02:26:42,250
But

3148
02:26:42,870 --> 02:26:44,030
what's,
how bad is he?

3149
02:26:44,170 --> 02:26:46,360
What was he saying?
Nothing that bad.

3150
02:26:46,390 --> 02:26:51,390
Then they're,
you just want them to tow the line and 

3151
02:26:51,390 --> 02:26:52,540
they also want him to be like humble and
grateful for being on Star Trek.

3152
02:26:52,690 --> 02:26:54,010
But he's like,
Hey folks,

3153
02:26:54,011 --> 02:26:56,020
it was just a TV show.
Lighten the fuck up.

3154
02:26:56,650 --> 02:27:01,650
And they're like,
it's just a TV show with social justice 

3155
02:27:01,650 --> 02:27:04,030
as its primary values and here you are.
We expect you to be so with that TV show

3156
02:27:04,360 --> 02:27:05,410
dot.
Yeah,

3157
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:06,790
he's Canadian too,
by the way.

3158
02:27:06,910 --> 02:27:07,920
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

3159
02:27:08,130 --> 02:27:09,310
No,
they're not foreign now.

3160
02:27:09,311 --> 02:27:10,170
He's wrong.
Yeah,

3161
02:27:10,210 --> 02:27:11,980
that's what I'm saying.
Um,

3162
02:27:12,250 --> 02:27:17,250
but uh,
I don't know like what they're arguing 

3163
02:27:17,250 --> 02:27:17,250
about.
It's hard.

3164
02:27:17,250 --> 02:27:17,560
I can't scroll back far enough to find 
out what they want to argue.

3165
02:27:17,890 --> 02:27:18,580
Oh yeah,
for sure.

3166
02:27:19,350 --> 02:27:24,350
I think he's awful.
I remember when you didn't know that 

3167
02:27:24,350 --> 02:27:26,701
William Shatner was so awful.
I guess I'll people tweet that like all 

3168
02:27:26,701 --> 02:27:28,540
these weird social justice warriors,
women I relax.

3169
02:27:28,870 --> 02:27:30,730
Why waste your time?
Those are got shit to do.

3170
02:27:30,820 --> 02:27:34,720
People 80 year old man living alone or 
do you think he's all.

3171
02:27:34,721 --> 02:27:38,440
He's got all these models.
There is 80 isn't he?

3172
02:27:38,680 --> 02:27:43,680
Isn't William Shatner only should be 
about this is what according to this 

3173
02:27:44,051 --> 02:27:45,550
article,
this is what the fight was about.

3174
02:27:45,551 --> 02:27:48,010
Came from some show called outlander.
Okay.

3175
02:27:48,010 --> 02:27:48,010
An

3176
02:27:48,090 --> 02:27:53,090
outlander fans,
the actor calling them snowflakes and 

3177
02:27:53,090 --> 02:27:55,791
social justice warriors is intricate and
fascinating in a way that only fandom 

3178
02:27:56,341 --> 02:28:00,390
beef involving an internationally famous
cultural icon can be.

3179
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:03,180
But to get the full picture,
we have to take a trip back in time to,

3180
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:03,960
to,
to,

3181
02:28:04,170 --> 02:28:04,660
to,
to,

3182
02:28:04,700 --> 02:28:09,700
to Schachner who acquitted with this guy
hugans you can you assist the prayer.

3183
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:13,430
Okay.
Uh,

3184
02:28:13,590 --> 02:28:15,300
believe the two stars,
the show,

3185
02:28:15,301 --> 02:28:20,301
Sam Hugans,
Hewkin and Caitriona Balfe should.

3186
02:28:21,350 --> 02:28:22,220
And real life.

3187
02:28:22,670 --> 02:28:25,100
Huh?
There's a group of fans,

3188
02:28:25,370 --> 02:28:26,540
people that love the show,

3189
02:28:27,550 --> 02:28:32,550
that thing of shippers,
they call themselves fans of a show who 

3190
02:28:32,550 --> 02:28:32,830
wants to see the two characters in a 
relationship.

3191
02:28:33,340 --> 02:28:38,340
They believe the two stars of the show,
Sam and Catriona should date in real 

3192
02:28:39,251 --> 02:28:44,251
life,
and it particularly hard line group of 

3193
02:28:44,251 --> 02:28:46,711
fandom bolsheviks that believed that 
they already are dating in secret and 

3194
02:28:47,711 --> 02:28:49,870
Schachner who's acquainted with,
uh,

3195
02:28:49,871 --> 02:28:54,070
one of the guys waded into the fray,
labeling those shippers,

3196
02:28:54,071 --> 02:28:57,670
those people as bullies and calling them
out on twitter.

3197
02:28:58,300 --> 02:29:03,300
It was a move that many fans also saw as
its own kind of bullying with shatner 

3198
02:29:03,850 --> 02:29:08,470
trying to kick a group out of fandom for
more nuanced,

3199
02:29:08,471 --> 02:29:11,020
a walkthrough.
There's an explanation,

3200
02:29:11,021 --> 02:29:11,320
blah,
blah,

3201
02:29:11,321 --> 02:29:12,730
blah.
Fast forward.

3202
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:18,140
Okay.
He'd gotten a fucking goofy war with 

3203
02:29:18,140 --> 02:29:18,140
trolls.
Yeah.

3204
02:29:18,140 --> 02:29:22,080
Here's some of the tweets and stuff.
Yeah.

3205
02:29:24,130 --> 02:29:25,150
Oh,
this is weird.

3206
02:29:25,330 --> 02:29:26,050
So he's.
What does it.

3207
02:29:26,051 --> 02:29:27,340
Hold it.
Stop back up.

3208
02:29:27,550 --> 02:29:32,550
Funny how an actress with an impressive 
resume is belittled by same feminists 

3209
02:29:32,550 --> 02:29:35,500
who say that an 86 year old man telling 
the truth is a massage.

3210
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:41,100
[inaudible] 86.
I can't believe that he's going to 

3211
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:41,100
check.
No.

3212
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:41,100
80 six.

3213
02:29:41,420 --> 02:29:42,550
Yeah.
Google it.

3214
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:46,170
Take a guess.
How old do you think he is?

3215
02:29:46,770 --> 02:29:47,830
I bet that's right.
That's it.

3216
02:29:47,850 --> 02:29:49,110
He's in his eighties.
That's correct.

3217
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:51,030
It's got to be.
When you're that close to death,

3218
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:54,180
do you really give a fuck enough to 
argue with people on twitter about who's

3219
02:29:54,181 --> 02:29:55,760
dating who?
That seems weird.

3220
02:29:55,761 --> 02:29:57,930
It says 86.
Wow.

3221
02:29:59,090 --> 02:30:04,090
It's pretty good for 86 does,
but like what is that like wire.

3222
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:07,650
Why are they going back and forth like 
that?

3223
02:30:07,651 --> 02:30:09,570
Seems like such a waste of time.
You're 86.

3224
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:14,680
Want to.
How much time do you have when you're 

3225
02:30:14,680 --> 02:30:14,730
86?
If you're super lucky.

3226
02:30:14,731 --> 02:30:16,020
You got 10 years.
Sometimes.

3227
02:30:16,021 --> 02:30:18,900
Old People like to argue it gives them 
strength and energy.

3228
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:21,210
It's like a vitamins.
Yeah.

3229
02:30:21,410 --> 02:30:22,140
Yeah.
Excuse me.

3230
02:30:22,370 --> 02:30:24,380
Fucking something up a fight.
You know,

3231
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:26,550
terrorism up the game.
Yeah,

3232
02:30:27,220 --> 02:30:28,740
like a fucking sport.
Yeah.

3233
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:33,000
Yeah.
They get tired.

3234
02:30:33,660 --> 02:30:36,570
They just need that adrenaline rush,
need anger fueled,

3235
02:30:36,780 --> 02:30:38,640
fueled by anger.
Anger is energy.

3236
02:30:40,050 --> 02:30:42,580
It's an adrenaline rush.
You just don't do.

3237
02:30:42,610 --> 02:30:44,850
You don't dive into the fray with dorks 
though.

3238
02:30:45,390 --> 02:30:47,460
That's where like that whole gamer gate 
went crazy.

3239
02:30:48,030 --> 02:30:50,610
You know,
like when women were trying to,

3240
02:30:50,611 --> 02:30:55,611
uh,
there was a bunch of women that were 

3241
02:30:55,611 --> 02:30:55,611
trying to,
they wanted to,

3242
02:30:55,611 --> 02:30:57,470
there was a bunch of stuff going on with
video games,

3243
02:30:57,471 --> 02:31:02,471
but they were concerned with sexism and 
video games and they were trying to 

3244
02:31:02,471 --> 02:31:02,630
censor video games than the,
you know,

3245
02:31:02,710 --> 02:31:07,710
are bullying people that believed one 
way and bullying people that believe in 

3246
02:31:07,710 --> 02:31:07,710
another way.
And then it became a,

3247
02:31:07,710 --> 02:31:09,230
uh,
dispute a nerd fight.

3248
02:31:09,950 --> 02:31:11,690
As soon as you get involved in any sort 
of nerdfighter,

3249
02:31:11,691 --> 02:31:14,060
no matter what side you're on,
it's going to be some chaos.

3250
02:31:14,061 --> 02:31:15,200
There's a lot of angry,
repeatable.

3251
02:31:16,670 --> 02:31:20,010
Don't,
can't even waste time doing

3252
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:22,460
that shit.
You fuck with video games or use it.

3253
02:31:22,470 --> 02:31:25,050
But I put that shit away like 10 years 
ago.

3254
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:28,170
What happened when you quit?
It was video games to take it up.

3255
02:31:28,171 --> 02:31:29,790
A lot of my time.
All this fun stuff.

3256
02:31:29,791 --> 02:31:31,290
Fuck video games.
Fuck me.

3257
02:31:31,291 --> 02:31:36,291
Fuck blow jobs too.
I was taking up a lot of my time but 

3258
02:31:36,291 --> 02:31:38,601
then.
But then porn became accessible and it 

3259
02:31:38,601 --> 02:31:40,900
took that.
Took that video game time away with 

3260
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:40,900
damn.
Really?

3261
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:43,350
How much video games and jerking off and
you're doing that seems like I can't do.

3262
02:31:43,351 --> 02:31:43,770
Uh,
both.

3263
02:31:43,771 --> 02:31:45,720
Man.
Could you have got to choose one?

3264
02:31:45,810 --> 02:31:48,720
How could you swap them though?
I feel like you'd dig with.

3265
02:31:48,980 --> 02:31:51,840
I just think it's just time wasted.
Yeah.

3266
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:54,270
Time wasted in and your hands are 
involved.

3267
02:31:56,280 --> 02:31:57,520
That's true.
Coordination.

3268
02:31:57,690 --> 02:31:59,760
Have you ever fucked with virtual 
reality?

3269
02:31:59,761 --> 02:32:02,650
Have you ever tried out any of those?
Those points?

3270
02:32:02,840 --> 02:32:04,250
No,
just,

3271
02:32:04,650 --> 02:32:07,710
I mean just trying those uh,
those headsets,

3272
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:12,750
like oculus rift or any of that stuff.
HTC Vive tried those.

3273
02:32:12,810 --> 02:32:17,810
Like I don't remember the games.
I've been to places where they have the 

3274
02:32:17,810 --> 02:32:20,391
samples and you could put it on and then
try it out long time ago now let's 

3275
02:32:20,391 --> 02:32:24,240
recently like try to.
I try to game at south by southwest,

3276
02:32:24,870 --> 02:32:27,840
was trying to,
like the helicopter was over there and I

3277
02:32:27,841 --> 02:32:31,710
had the thing on and I was like flying 
it and try to move it,

3278
02:32:31,711 --> 02:32:33,240
but I don't know what the name of the 
game was.

3279
02:32:33,300 --> 02:32:38,300
What did you do at South by southwest?
I did a show there and then I went to 

3280
02:32:38,300 --> 02:32:39,750
the,
to the in order main convention center.

3281
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:42,480
Let me ask you this,
why shouldn't they pay you to perform at

3282
02:32:42,481 --> 02:32:43,230
south by southwest?

3283
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:43,770
Yeah.
Yeah,

3284
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:45,330
they did.
They have to pay now.

3285
02:32:45,530 --> 02:32:46,530
Yeah.
Dude,

3286
02:32:47,010 --> 02:32:48,210
they didn't.
They were not paying?

3287
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:50,190
No,
they weren't for the longest time.

3288
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:55,280
Oh Shit.
You would just go and it would be like 

3289
02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:55,280
you'd performed.
There was a privilege.

3290
02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:56,640
I went there,
I went there twice.

3291
02:32:56,641 --> 02:32:59,290
I went there last year with and that 
was,

3292
02:32:59,490 --> 02:33:03,720
I was taping a show for showtime.
Showtime paid you so time paid.

3293
02:33:03,721 --> 02:33:08,330
And then I went this year and it was 
just a show at a club and uh,

3294
02:33:08,370 --> 02:33:10,130
they pay for that.
They flew out,

3295
02:33:10,140 --> 02:33:12,360
flew me out,
put me up and pay you for that.

3296
02:33:12,450 --> 02:33:17,450
I got an offer once and what they 
offered me is if I came down there and 

3297
02:33:17,450 --> 02:33:21,471
did their thing,
I would get a free pass to allow me to 

3298
02:33:21,471 --> 02:33:22,470
go to all the shows and it was worth 
like 1500 bucks.

3299
02:33:22,471 --> 02:33:23,940
I was like,
are you out of your fucking mind?

3300
02:33:24,930 --> 02:33:27,420
But they don't pay for your hotel.
They didn't pay for your flight.

3301
02:33:27,450 --> 02:33:28,680
They just offered.
I was like,

3302
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:33,740
maybe this is just like one faction of 
this organization that thinks it's a 

3303
02:33:33,740 --> 02:33:35,610
good idea to offer that to people.
You know who's doing that bumper shoot?

3304
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:36,660
What's bumper?
Shoot?

3305
02:33:36,750 --> 02:33:39,840
It's a music festival like I've done 
bonaroo.

3306
02:33:39,930 --> 02:33:42,990
They pay you,
they fly you out and they put you up.

3307
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:45,300
Bumper shoot.
It's in Seattle.

3308
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:51,230
It's at the end of August.
Going into the August 31st going into 

3309
02:33:51,571 --> 02:33:56,571
September third and basically what 
they're paying me covers my hotel room.

3310
02:33:58,440 --> 02:34:03,440
I have to pay to pretty much fly there,
but I go to this music festival just 

3311
02:34:06,571 --> 02:34:07,970
ridiculous.
It is ridiculous.

3312
02:34:07,980 --> 02:34:12,980
You're going to do it.
I'm just doing it for the fun of going 

3313
02:34:12,980 --> 02:34:12,980
to the music festival.
Why would you do that?

3314
02:34:12,980 --> 02:34:17,210
You're going to,
you're going to be in Seattle this 

3315
02:34:17,210 --> 02:34:17,210
Friday night with me.
Hey.

3316
02:34:17,210 --> 02:34:17,210
All right.
That's.

3317
02:34:17,770 --> 02:34:17,980
You have

3318
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:19,610
to go back for that bullshit.
Yeah.

3319
02:34:20,050 --> 02:34:21,970
Friday night.
Paramount theater to shows.

3320
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:27,000
No doubt.
Some tickets available for the second 

3321
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:27,070
show.
Joe Rogan.net

3322
02:34:27,071 --> 02:34:28,780
for this last tour.
Yeah.

3323
02:34:28,890 --> 02:34:30,610
Um,
Seattle's the shit though.

3324
02:34:30,670 --> 02:34:32,830
It's a place to perform,
but I'm not going there for free.

3325
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:35,560
That's stupid because you know someone's
making money.

3326
02:34:35,590 --> 02:34:38,050
They wouldn't ask you to go if it wasn't
somebody is making money.

3327
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:43,200
That's just gross.
That's what they were doing with south 

3328
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:45,391
by southwest.
Duncan did a video explaining it when 

3329
02:34:45,391 --> 02:34:45,391
they offered it to him.
Hilarious.

3330
02:34:45,391 --> 02:34:47,130
He did a video with a,
you know,

3331
02:34:47,140 --> 02:34:52,140
that Hitler video where Hitler was like 
yelling at a bunch of German and the 

3332
02:34:52,140 --> 02:34:55,800
subtitles and Duncan subtitles.
We're all about like south by southwest 

3333
02:34:55,800 --> 02:34:55,870
like,
oh,

3334
02:34:56,070 --> 02:34:59,280
they get people to work for free.
It's just,

3335
02:34:59,290 --> 02:35:02,710
it's a fucking airlines.
It's run by a giant corporation.

3336
02:35:02,910 --> 02:35:06,510
Like you can't pretend that it's like 
some hippie sort of a.

3337
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:12,000
They making good billions.
I mean he must be this giant right and 

3338
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:12,850
bumper.
She was making money.

3339
02:35:13,270 --> 02:35:14,830
So what are they doing?
I don't know.

3340
02:35:14,831 --> 02:35:16,570
They don't.
They're not giving it to the comics.

3341
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:20,020
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.

3342
02:35:20,320 --> 02:35:21,940
We need to come up with their own 
festival.

3343
02:35:21,970 --> 02:35:23,380
I've been thinking about this.
Oh yeah.

3344
02:35:23,530 --> 02:35:25,540
Yeah.
To come up with something to do out here

3345
02:35:25,630 --> 02:35:26,870
that would kill.
Yeah.

3346
02:35:27,350 --> 02:35:30,820
We'll definitely run it through the ice 
house to shows every night.

3347
02:35:31,210 --> 02:35:32,260
Both.
Both rooms.

3348
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:34,630
A little room in the big room.
Do it for like a week.

3349
02:35:34,810 --> 02:35:36,070
Yeah.
You know,

3350
02:35:36,270 --> 02:35:37,930
there are definitely some crazy.
Yeah,

3351
02:35:37,940 --> 02:35:39,260
right.
Yeah.

3352
02:35:39,420 --> 02:35:41,590
But do an intimate,
small,

3353
02:35:41,591 --> 02:35:44,770
small venue.
Think about it.

3354
02:35:45,340 --> 02:35:46,600
I wouldn't want to organize that though

3355
02:35:46,900 --> 02:35:49,090
and I wouldn't want to like say no to 
someone who sucks,

3356
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:50,590
you know?
They're like,

3357
02:35:50,591 --> 02:35:51,090
hey,
yeah,

3358
02:35:51,130 --> 02:35:52,360
so here's a schedule.
And I'm like,

3359
02:35:52,361 --> 02:35:53,950
why is that guy out there?
That's the problem.

3360
02:35:53,951 --> 02:35:55,360
Yeah,
that's the problem.

3361
02:35:55,420 --> 02:35:57,250
Like I was talking to Al Magical about 
that.

3362
02:35:57,440 --> 02:35:59,350
He's talking about putting together that
comedy network.

3363
02:35:59,820 --> 02:36:01,330
There's a couple of people on this 
comedy network.

3364
02:36:01,400 --> 02:36:01,800
He's like

3365
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:07,330
the fuck you gotta.
Be careful,

3366
02:36:07,770 --> 02:36:12,770
you know?
Got To be careful putting together a 

3367
02:36:12,770 --> 02:36:12,770
network of people.
Yeah.

3368
02:36:12,770 --> 02:36:16,560
Because some people are either unaware 
or just belligerently don't care.

3369
02:36:17,111 --> 02:36:18,640
They just want to get on.
Yeah.

3370
02:36:18,641 --> 02:36:21,190
And they'll try to force their way in 
and yeah.

3371
02:36:21,570 --> 02:36:24,450
Do you uh,
that that's an issue with podcasts?

3372
02:36:24,750 --> 02:36:26,580
People try to force their way on your 
podcast,

3373
02:36:26,581 --> 02:36:29,280
that corner you asked you.
I get that shit all the time.

3374
02:36:29,281 --> 02:36:34,281
People that just,
there's no way I would have them on the 

3375
02:36:34,281 --> 02:36:35,000
corner me and want to get on the 
podcast.

3376
02:36:35,001 --> 02:36:35,490
I'm like,
Jesus,

3377
02:36:35,550 --> 02:36:38,790
this way you think works and just get.
If I wanted you to be honest,

3378
02:36:38,820 --> 02:36:40,920
ask you they have nothing.
They have nothing to lose.

3379
02:36:40,990 --> 02:36:42,260
Yeah,
sure.

3380
02:36:42,270 --> 02:36:43,010
Act.
I want to.

3381
02:36:43,140 --> 02:36:45,300
I want you to watch her act with me.
It was go over together,

3382
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:47,850
sit down there with a yellow legal pad 
and go,

3383
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:50,820
what the fuck is that?
So there is,

3384
02:36:51,300 --> 02:36:54,120
it's just a personality.
Conflict is a real problem.

3385
02:36:54,121 --> 02:36:57,000
It's not even like the material as much 
as who they are.

3386
02:36:57,810 --> 02:37:00,450
Some people you just don't.
Some people are just not that aware.

3387
02:37:00,840 --> 02:37:03,810
They don't make good conversationalists 
you don't want to be around them.

3388
02:37:03,950 --> 02:37:07,380
Right.
Especially some people like based on the

3389
02:37:07,381 --> 02:37:12,381
material,
like you're not a good 

3390
02:37:12,381 --> 02:37:12,381
conversationalist.
Yeah,

3391
02:37:12,381 --> 02:37:12,381
yeah.
If you're talking about that,

3392
02:37:13,300 --> 02:37:14,840
it's just.
I don't know.

3393
02:37:14,841 --> 02:37:15,770
I get it.
I get it.

3394
02:37:15,771 --> 02:37:16,010
People

3395
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:17,960
want to promote themselves,
they want things to go ahead,

3396
02:37:17,961 --> 02:37:22,070
but like sometimes it's like how much 
should we be promoting yourself,

3397
02:37:22,071 --> 02:37:24,260
how much you should be working on 
improving yourself.

3398
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:29,290
And there's,
there was always those people that were 

3399
02:37:29,290 --> 02:37:30,630
like really good promoters,
but they didn't have a really good 

3400
02:37:30,630 --> 02:37:32,531
product,
but they have enough of a good product 

3401
02:37:32,531 --> 02:37:34,430
that the promotion sort of carry their 
product and the enthusiasm behind it got

3402
02:37:34,431 --> 02:37:36,580
people into it.
I call it the Hustle Gino.

3403
02:37:36,670 --> 02:37:39,960
Oh wish I had more of the hustle gene,
you know what I mean?

3404
02:37:40,410 --> 02:37:45,410
But then I wonder how much of my 
creativity would have to sacrifice for 

3405
02:37:45,571 --> 02:37:47,760
the wholesale Jean.
And

3406
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:49,400
it's a conundrum,
you know,

3407
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:54,440
it seems like the people who really 
hustle aren't as good as the most 

3408
02:37:55,390 --> 02:37:57,390
creative.
That's what it feels like.

3409
02:37:57,420 --> 02:37:59,130
Yeah.
That's what it really feels like.

3410
02:37:59,131 --> 02:38:01,860
It does feel like that.
So that's the scary thing.

3411
02:38:01,890 --> 02:38:03,990
Especially the promotional gene.
Yeah.

3412
02:38:04,050 --> 02:38:05,670
The promotional genes.
And Weird one,

3413
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:11,120
you know,
those dudes that like early on open mic 

3414
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:11,370
nights they were starting their own open
mic and putting up flyers and say like,

3415
02:38:11,420 --> 02:38:14,040
what,
how are you so confident?

3416
02:38:14,910 --> 02:38:18,480
You know,
I'm not inviting anybody throw it out of

3417
02:38:18,481 --> 02:38:22,020
here out at all.
It was the last time you showed up at an

3418
02:38:22,021 --> 02:38:24,480
open mic into the set.
Oh Shit.

3419
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:27,800
Uh,
I went back to,

3420
02:38:28,010 --> 02:38:30,020
I didn't do a set.
We went to Madison,

3421
02:38:30,021 --> 02:38:35,021
Wisconsin to do the weekend at comedy on
state and then his pizza shop that has 

3422
02:38:36,771 --> 02:38:41,771
an open mic.
So after the show on I think Thursday 

3423
02:38:41,771 --> 02:38:44,180
night we went to the pizza shop and we 
put our names on a list.

3424
02:38:44,690 --> 02:38:49,550
But then they ended the show before.
So it was like,

3425
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:51,590
I want it to do it.

3426
02:38:52,660 --> 02:38:54,370
Was it too many people that signed up?
Is that what it,

3427
02:38:54,371 --> 02:38:56,800
is that what you're saying?
It was like we got there because we just

3428
02:38:56,801 --> 02:39:01,801
did a show.
We got there towards the end of the few 

3429
02:39:01,801 --> 02:39:02,760
audience members were leaving.

3430
02:39:02,820 --> 02:39:06,090
That's the thing about open mics,
like some comics are new and they're not

3431
02:39:06,091 --> 02:39:08,970
that good.
So how much is the audience going to sit

3432
02:39:08,971 --> 02:39:10,560
through?
You know,

3433
02:39:10,561 --> 02:39:12,990
they might've sat through five back 
conferences,

3434
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,270
lot to sit through and you might have 
sat through more.

3435
02:39:15,540 --> 02:39:20,540
Oh yeah.
So then they don't know who's coming up 

3436
02:39:20,540 --> 02:39:20,540
next.

3437
02:39:20,540 --> 02:39:20,950
Well that's what's weird about the store
these days.

3438
02:39:20,980 --> 02:39:22,780
Even the open mic night.
It's packed.

3439
02:39:23,350 --> 02:39:25,720
Yeah.
Have you noticed it's crazy.

3440
02:39:26,400 --> 02:39:31,400
Go to open mic now.
There's 100 people in the audience and 

3441
02:39:31,400 --> 02:39:31,400
you're like,
whoa.

3442
02:39:31,400 --> 02:39:32,470
But they're putting some of the store 
comics on those shows too.

3443
02:39:33,270 --> 02:39:34,600
Smart.
They're smart.

3444
02:39:35,230 --> 02:39:40,230
It is smart.
But there's something about a like a 

3445
02:39:40,230 --> 02:39:42,320
real regular open mic night.
It's just like the.

3446
02:39:42,580 --> 02:39:46,450
This is the first sparks from a piece of
metal and a rock.

3447
02:39:46,630 --> 02:39:51,630
When you start a fire feel,
that's a thing where people try to make 

3448
02:39:51,791 --> 02:39:53,230
fire kill you.
Bang comedy.

3449
02:39:53,770 --> 02:39:56,110
That's like the first sparks and you see
it and you're like,

3450
02:39:56,190 --> 02:39:57,910
Ooh.
It makes me nervous.

3451
02:39:58,450 --> 02:40:00,520
Yeah,
it is kind of nerve wracking.

3452
02:40:01,150 --> 02:40:06,150
I used to do them a lot when I first 
moved out here just to get stage time 

3453
02:40:06,150 --> 02:40:09,040
because I,
I kind of refuse to like audition to get

3454
02:40:09,041 --> 02:40:11,350
in the comedy store.
At first I was like,

3455
02:40:11,740 --> 02:40:14,010
I've already done TV spots.
I got to audition to get

3456
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:17,130
in the store until,
until I really got it and they said,

3457
02:40:17,131 --> 02:40:18,610
you know what,
you need to get them to the store and to

3458
02:40:18,611 --> 02:40:23,611
the laugh factory.
And then I was writing a lot so I was 

3459
02:40:23,611 --> 02:40:23,611
like,
Yay.

3460
02:40:23,611 --> 02:40:27,150
But then when I realized that the night 
I got into the store was like one of the

3461
02:40:27,151 --> 02:40:30,150
best nights in show business for me.
Oh yeah,

3462
02:40:30,151 --> 02:40:31,350
right.
It's like validation.

3463
02:40:31,410 --> 02:40:32,790
Yeah.
You're paid regular.

3464
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:33,510
Yeah.
And I was like,

3465
02:40:33,540 --> 02:40:36,240
I can work out in 15 minute chunks,
right.

3466
02:40:36,241 --> 02:40:41,241
Material I call my manager has just 
gotten to stories like I've never heard 

3467
02:40:41,311 --> 02:40:43,200
you excited about anything.
What's the big deal?

3468
02:40:44,060 --> 02:40:44,630
And I was like,
Yo,

3469
02:40:44,650 --> 02:40:46,350
don't you understand?
I could work out.

3470
02:40:47,450 --> 02:40:48,990
Yeah,
it's the store.

3471
02:40:49,320 --> 02:40:50,880
He didn't get it.
You're in Mecca.

3472
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:52,620
Yeah,
that's what it is.

3473
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:58,040
Yeah.
When you pull into that parking lot and 

3474
02:40:58,040 --> 02:41:00,111
you get out and you go say hi to 
everybody and you want it to those 

3475
02:41:00,111 --> 02:41:00,111
hallways,
you see,

3476
02:41:00,111 --> 02:41:00,111
oh,
ours kill.

3477
02:41:00,111 --> 02:41:02,310
And you go into the main rooms packed 
someone's crushing,

3478
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:05,530
you go upstairs to belly room poem.
Someone's upstairs smashing.

3479
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:07,870
It's like you just stepped into the 
comedy Mecca,

3480
02:41:08,910 --> 02:41:10,710
you know?
And to be a part of that,

3481
02:41:10,980 --> 02:41:12,360
to be allowed to be a part of that.

3482
02:41:13,030 --> 02:41:18,030
And it's funny,
it's like there's so many up and coming 

3483
02:41:18,030 --> 02:41:18,830
young comics that want to get in there 
and look up to it,

3484
02:41:19,230 --> 02:41:21,470
you know,
now and now it's like,

3485
02:41:21,890 --> 02:41:24,020
it's just,
just bananas.

3486
02:41:24,770 --> 02:41:26,150
It's interesting seeing it again.
Right.

3487
02:41:26,151 --> 02:41:27,830
We were talking about the other day,
what it used to be like,

3488
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,800
what is what it's like now.
This is the golden age.

3489
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:33,140
Yeah.
I got in there when it used to be like.

3490
02:41:33,141 --> 02:41:37,760
And I was still excited because I just 
knew I'd be able to develop their right,

3491
02:41:37,820 --> 02:41:40,500
you know,
so that was,

3492
02:41:40,550 --> 02:41:45,550
that was useful like when I started 
because before I kinda wasn't taking 

3493
02:41:45,550 --> 02:41:49,661
comedy serious and then like I kinda 
just got tired of it and kind of fell 

3494
02:41:50,811 --> 02:41:51,590
out of love with it.

3495
02:41:51,850 --> 02:41:52,940
Well,
you're doing a lot of writing.

3496
02:41:53,490 --> 02:41:55,520
I'm going to do so much.
Staff writing,

3497
02:41:55,521 --> 02:42:00,521
you know,
and you're showing up at that job every 

3498
02:42:00,521 --> 02:42:00,521
day.
Writing.

3499
02:42:00,521 --> 02:42:01,040
Sometimes it takes away your motivation

3500
02:42:01,100 --> 02:42:02,510
for sure.
Did the.

3501
02:42:02,810 --> 02:42:07,810
And then for some reason let's say he's 
trying to get back,

3502
02:42:08,211 --> 02:42:13,211
get into these clubs,
the laugh factory and the store and 

3503
02:42:13,211 --> 02:42:15,970
started my desire started increasing for
stand up.

3504
02:42:16,040 --> 02:42:17,330
You got to put it out.
Specials on.

3505
02:42:17,510 --> 02:42:18,090
Yeah.
No.

3506
02:42:18,170 --> 02:42:20,360
What are you going to do on?
I had to just shoot it myself,

3507
02:42:20,530 --> 02:42:21,750
like you've been telling me.
Yeah.

3508
02:42:21,800 --> 02:42:24,200
Yeah.
So hopefully by the end of the year,

3509
02:42:24,920 --> 02:42:26,610
a few months.
Yeah,

3510
02:42:26,630 --> 02:42:26,990
do it.

3511
02:42:27,740 --> 02:42:28,470
Definitely.
Yeah.

3512
02:42:28,490 --> 02:42:32,010
He's needs to happen.
People need to see your set and then you

3513
02:42:32,011 --> 02:42:35,400
need to throw it out and write new shit 
to you too.

3514
02:42:35,401 --> 02:42:35,760
Good.

3515
02:42:35,950 --> 02:42:40,950
Yeah.
I'm saying I'm sitting on stuff because 

3516
02:42:40,950 --> 02:42:43,380
I haven't used it,
but the only way to write new shit like 

3517
02:42:43,380 --> 02:42:45,190
have new shit,
but I would have morning shit if I had a

3518
02:42:45,191 --> 02:42:46,830
special and got rid of the oldest ship.

3519
02:42:47,350 --> 02:42:48,220
Well,
you know what I want to do,

3520
02:42:48,221 --> 02:42:50,800
man,
after I do my next a Netflix special.

3521
02:42:50,801 --> 02:42:55,801
I want to do like a Rodney dangerfield 
type thing where I bring up a bunch of 

3522
02:42:55,990 --> 02:42:59,260
what I think of the best up and coming 
comics and have like a special.

3523
02:42:59,261 --> 02:43:01,660
Like Rodney dangerfield used to have 
those specials spiel.

3524
02:43:01,780 --> 02:43:03,490
Yeah.
I want to do something like that.

3525
02:43:04,070 --> 02:43:06,490
I'll just host it,
bring people up.

3526
02:43:07,220 --> 02:43:11,380
That's my next move.
The Nice House or something.

3527
02:43:11,381 --> 02:43:12,240
It'd be cool.
Yeah,

3528
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:13,190
exactly.
Yeah.

3529
02:43:13,191 --> 02:43:18,191
Doing now that the ice house.
Because Rodney dangerfield used to the 

3530
02:43:18,191 --> 02:43:18,191
danger fields.
New York City.

3531
02:43:18,191 --> 02:43:18,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

3532
02:43:18,611 --> 02:43:19,870
Man.
You ever worked that place?

3533
02:43:20,320 --> 02:43:22,000
Yeah.
Shit Hole.

3534
02:43:22,480 --> 02:43:26,590
It's not what it used to be fun though.
So great old place.

3535
02:43:27,100 --> 02:43:32,100
They had great cheeseburgers.
They had the best cheeseburgers in New 

3536
02:43:32,100 --> 02:43:32,100
York City.
Man,

3537
02:43:32,100 --> 02:43:32,290
when you used to work there needs to be 
able to get a cheat.

3538
02:43:32,291 --> 02:43:34,740
I was excited to eat a cheeseburger 
there.

3539
02:43:34,750 --> 02:43:39,750
They had amazing cheeseburgers.
They like Ground Philemon neon or 

3540
02:43:39,750 --> 02:43:40,350
something like that.
Good stuff was simple.

3541
02:43:40,351 --> 02:43:42,070
Like when I used to do a spot at the 
strip,

3542
02:43:42,670 --> 02:43:47,670
like on a Monday night after you picked 
a number out of the hat on a Friday and 

3543
02:43:47,670 --> 02:43:51,661
you get one Monday out of the month to 
perform and then me and the open mic 

3544
02:43:51,661 --> 02:43:55,540
because we're like let's go to Jackson 
hole and eat a burger.

3545
02:43:55,990 --> 02:43:57,800
Like at midnight.
Yeah.

3546
02:43:57,820 --> 02:44:02,350
And just like just felt so accomplished,
you know,

3547
02:44:02,351 --> 02:44:07,351
just just doing this artist thing or 
this comedy thing and you eaten like you

3548
02:44:07,781 --> 02:44:10,510
heard about Jackson hole or just 
someplace and you're eating there.

3549
02:44:10,870 --> 02:44:15,870
We used to dream about let's go to 
Carnegie Deli because all these comics 

3550
02:44:15,870 --> 02:44:16,900
used to sit there and eat and shit like 
that.

3551
02:44:17,330 --> 02:44:20,050
Man.
I just romantic New York comedy,

3552
02:44:20,051 --> 02:44:22,360
Shit like that.
It was like that store too.

3553
02:44:22,361 --> 02:44:27,361
It's carnies a little,
a little in the standard going across 

3554
02:44:27,401 --> 02:44:29,540
the channel.
The standard late at night after shows I

3555
02:44:29,570 --> 02:44:31,210
used to go to males.
Yeah.

3556
02:44:31,280 --> 02:44:36,040
Yeah.
When the fruit is kicked out of,

3557
02:44:36,050 --> 02:44:38,660
I could say the standard is set.
Fantastic.

3558
02:44:38,670 --> 02:44:41,380
Then as standard has amazing food and 
it's open super late.

3559
02:44:41,381 --> 02:44:43,420
You can get like real good food at like 
midnight.

3560
02:44:44,410 --> 02:44:46,520
All Right Ian,
