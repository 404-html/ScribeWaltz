12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,840
Have you ever seen one of these things 
before?

13
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,450
I've never seen him.
No one has had sex with us as clean.

14
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,430
You can feel it.
It's very,

15
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:10,300
um,
it's amazing.

16
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:14,830
Amazing device.
American ingenuity at it's best when you

17
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:16,060
do.
He ended up in the microwave.

18
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,190
I don't recommend that.
Think that.

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,900
Get damaged.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Finished.
They did.

21
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,170
You see the,
they call it like the jerk of cups.

22
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:27,690
They have like cups in Japan.
You,

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,910
you,
I swear to God.

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,060
It has a little like selling thing on 
it,

25
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:34,980
you know,
so to keep it moist and there's a little

26
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:39,981
hole in it and it's actually.
You can use it in that throw away my 

27
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:39,981
buddy.
Yeah.

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,480
We went up to the room.
My buddy goes right away.

29
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,770
He says,
men that were usable.

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Let's say that's not right to the best 
was that my other friend,

31
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,450
he forgot it in the little.
A paper bag at at worst.

32
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:56,430
So for magazines in the bag,
all social.

33
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:59,490
When we left off to Tokyo and Hilton,
the Hilton hotel,

34
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,400
we walked up and his little girl goes,
Hey sir,

35
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:05,160
you forgot your age.
She looks in there and she,

36
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,420
she looks at my buddy's like,
chuck.

37
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,290
And he goes,
yeah,

38
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,800
I know.
So she knows exactly what it is.

39
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,630
Exactly what it is.
Very common in Japan.

40
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,190
It was there.
A bunch of freaks over there.

41
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:15,510
Right?
This small.

42
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,010
Wow.
Yeah.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,210
So the whole.
What happened?

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,030
The whole cup.
So yeah,

45
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,880
Nina's can only go in.
It's for small penises.

46
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,170
I guess you have to make a whole lot to 
say how's that work?

47
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,520
It's not designed for American or Dutch 
Cox Right now,

48
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,850
for those who don't know who we're 
talking to.

49
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,240
This is a,
a true mixed martial arts legend or real

50
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:41,241
pioneer.
A Bas rutten was a former UFC 

51
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:41,610
heavyweight champion.
And when I first saw boss fight,

52
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,560
I saw you fight back before there was 
any real good striking and mixed martial

53
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:48,720
arts.
Mixed martial arts was a lot of.

54
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:49,290
It was,
you know,

55
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,000
karate guys and where'd that good?
You know,

56
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:56,001
there was a few people that were just 
wild and crazy that we're getting in 

57
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:56,001
there and trying it.
And uh,

58
00:02:56,001 --> 00:03:00,650
there was pancreas was going on over in 
Japan and a buddy of mine had sent me a 

59
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,140
tape and they'd say,
ah,

60
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,190
I forgot who gave me the tape,
but he goes,

61
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:05,230
you got to wash this motherfucker pause 
route.

62
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,200
And it is,
it's finally a guy who's over there that

63
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:13,201
knows how to strike.
And you were bottle last and guys like 

64
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:13,930
in pancreas,
it was a lot of like they had these,

65
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,990
these Shannon that Shin Pads on for 
folks who haven't seen it and you 

66
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,650
weren't allowed to punch to the face.
But you could use open palms.

67
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,860
So what boss figured out how to do was 
pull his hand way back so he was 

68
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,100
punching with his palm where everybody 
else was doing bitch slaps.

69
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,340
Boss was blasting,
guys would straight right palms and 

70
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,720
knocking them unconscious and body kicks
that they just couldn't believe how much

71
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:42,721
pain they were in.
You were one of the first guys from 

72
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:42,721
Holland that,
that you know,

73
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:46,090
that hard Dutch style of kickboxing to 
enter into mixed martial arts.

74
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,340
I,
I worked,

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,250
I used that already.
Polished rocks when I was a bouncer.

76
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,970
Didn't like to mess up my fish oil.
And I always thought you have a way 

77
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,150
longer reach like for instance,
a left to grade straight,

78
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:59,180
you know,
that combination,

79
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,250
it's great.
But if you,

80
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,550
if you connect with the left Hook,
you're too close for the straight punch 

81
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:05,830
and had the longer the punches the more 
power.

82
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,100
So I said why don't hate with a poem,
you know,

83
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,110
because then it becomes almost as long 
as my straight punch so destroyed will 

84
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,110
have more effect,
you know?

85
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,250
And then people started thinking and I 
sat and if he had bi,

86
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,140
the ear,
if you can see when I'm fighting,

87
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,460
I'm hitting right here just behind the 
ear at the job and the jaw starts.

88
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,290
And if you tap it there,
yeah,

89
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,400
you'll drop where you're one of those 
guys to you.

90
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:30,401
You analyze different ways to attack 
opponents and that's why you've got all 

91
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,900
these videos online of self defense 
techniques and bars.

92
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,600
If you haven't seen these videos,
have you seen the music?

93
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:37,870
Video one is fantastic.
No,

94
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,400
sorry,
I'm not sorry.

95
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,400
Oh,
looky,

96
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,890
look what we get here.
How did that get started?

97
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:47,020
How did you start doing those?
It was the funniest thing.

98
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,320
I made the big bus writtens big books of
combat.

99
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,200
And then um,
the,

100
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,070
I promise that the first 300 people 
we're going to get a self defense,

101
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,720
a book,
a small one,

102
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:00,820
the small book like 50 page book or 
something.

103
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,980
But then this guy screwed me over with 
the books and when it all happened,

104
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:07,090
you know,
I left this guy,

105
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,470
but I came back to him.
I said,

106
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:13,471
listen,
I told the people the first 300 we're 

107
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:13,471
going to get it and I want to keep my 
word,

108
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:16,100
but I don't want to do anything with 
this guy anymore because you know,

109
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,190
it took too much for me already.
So anyway,

110
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:18,940
we said,
why not?

111
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:23,941
I'm making a video,
we do an instructional DVD and then we 

112
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:25,120
give that to the first 300 people.

113
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,740
Oh,
that's great.

114
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,220
What do you want to get the camera?
It was like totally non scripted,

115
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,240
you know,
when we started at the bar,

116
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:36,241
how funny was that?
You know that I go around the bar and I 

117
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:36,860
see a little,
what do you call it?

118
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:38,020
A saucer or something.
I said,

119
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:43,021
okay,
well they should get throw it into 

120
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:43,021
districts.
You can break it now it's got sharp.

121
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:43,021
You can slice them,
you know,

122
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:45,900
and then when I go through the thing 
that holds the receipts,

123
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,970
that pin I grab and I look at the thing 
and I go,

124
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,940
I don't need to tell your words can do 
it.

125
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,240
It was the funniest.
We had to stop so many times that we 

126
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,770
were dying laughing and that's all one 
take,

127
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:58,690
no preparation,

128
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,600
nothing.
We'll see.

129
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:04,601
You don't have to worry about things 
that you think like that all the time 

130
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:05,120
and being a bouncer.
That is one one.

131
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:06,770
I've never been a bouncing,
but I did well.

132
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,900
I actually did work as a bouncer at a 
concert.

133
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,080
A place had great woods.
There's a concert center and there was a

134
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,540
lot of fights as cons.
You're constantly dealing with fights,

135
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,270
but that's different than a bar because 
the bar is more dangerous,

136
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,700
is more contained to concert place is 
big and wide open.

137
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:22,430
It was an outdoor venue.
Know when you're at a bar,

138
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:25,290
you must've seen a lot of shit,
especially in Holland.

139
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,200
Holland is a fucking crazy place.

140
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,270
It is.
It is a crazy place and you have to 

141
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,270
watch out.
And you know,

142
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,290
I wasn't in that era that they really 
started coming with the weapons.

143
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,640
I was always fortunate to know to uh,
what the big guys would come in and they

144
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:40,670
would actually give guns to us.
You know,

145
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,550
we'll put them to the side and when they
come in with their guns.

146
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,240
Oh yeah.
And uh,

147
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,260
will be putting restored them for them 
before they went into a homeless 

148
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,260
shelter.
It was crazy.

149
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,080
You know,
I had one guy,

150
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,110
it was a,
it was high up there was actually cool 

151
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,110
because I worked there only for like two
weeks.

152
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,371
It was a big place.
The galaxy and Seth Rogen boss and a 

153
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:04,160
very known place that gets big epic 
fights there,

154
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,430
man.
Really cool.

155
00:07:05,431 --> 00:07:07,440
And um,
this guy walks at any rate,

156
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,140
something broke out and right away the 
big guy,

157
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,490
the guy was on top of the ladder.
He grabbed me from the front and he bear

158
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:17,370
hugs me and he says,
we're just going to stand like this.

159
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,610
And I said,
Whoa,

160
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,780
is this,
I just want to take the worst one,

161
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:24,690
the most dangerous one.
I just want to old you have lead this.

162
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
So that was kind of a compliment because
all the other bonuses heard it.

163
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,810
And they go like,
who's this game?

164
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,290
Then the world starts to travel.
United goes.

165
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,730
So,
uh,

166
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Holland,
the fights that happened in Holland and 

167
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,370
in bars,
it seems to happen a lot with MMA guys.

168
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:41,960
I know you've been in a bunch of them.
Alistair overeem fucked up his hand.

169
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,480
He got in a big one.
Know it's just constantly a kickboxing 

170
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,240
and MMA guys are always getting into bar
fights.

171
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,580
Well just the boats is really think that
they can do something and I don't know 

172
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,841
why,
maybe it is because they got more of 

173
00:07:57,841 --> 00:07:57,841
them and they think,
you know,

174
00:07:57,841 --> 00:08:02,760
so they give you shit.
They want to dig into the shell because 

175
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:02,760
it's.
Do you find,

176
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,560
do you find that because you have such a
reputation,

177
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:10,561
do you find that like guys get drunk and
then they want to test themselves that 

178
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:10,561
happen?

179
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:14,460
I had that fill that whole bar fight and
Sweden happened and after that,

180
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,130
for some reason I never had it any more.

181
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,210
And what was the firefighting sweet.
Because that was a very famous,

182
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:22,700
like that was the internet.
What happened with that?

183
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,790
Well,
I walked in and what year was this?

184
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,050
Oh God,
I don't know.

185
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,590
It was like 96 or seven.

186
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,670
So you weren't the UFC champion then,
what year did you win the UFC was in 

187
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,820
[inaudible] $99.
Ninety nine I think.

188
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah.
So,

189
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,230
but they,
they recognize you from kickboxing,

190
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,280
from mma.
You already famous in the MMA world and 

191
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,280
the,
you know,

192
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,280
the.

193
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Oh yeah,
yeah.

194
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,310
I was there for a seminar.
People knew me,

195
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,550
you know,
and to end to bonuses right away when I 

196
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:51,550
came in to say,
Hey Rutan,

197
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,311
stay calm tonight.
And it wasn't a little alarm bell going 

198
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:54,311
off in my mind,
you know,

199
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:54,620
maybe I shouldn't go in,
but I go,

200
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:55,890
uh,
I was drunk already.

201
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,590
Why not?
Right.

202
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,900
So I go in with my buddy crazy friend 
from Holland,

203
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,660
not a house and,
and,

204
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,520
and sure enough they started,
um,

205
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:10,530
they,
they certainly asked me because I'm 

206
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:10,530
jumping around and having fun,
you know,

207
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:10,530
hey,
what's up?

208
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:10,530
Hey,
what's up everybody?

209
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:10,530
You know,
me,

210
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,940
man.
I tried to make friends with everybody,

211
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,370
tried to speak Swedish,
you know,

212
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,270
and um,
they,

213
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,500
they say,
can you come with us?

214
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:21,530
So we go to these two doors through 
these two doors and there's a big fire 

215
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:21,960
stairs,
like a marble stairs giant.

216
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,070
And he says,
well,

217
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:24,480
we want you to leave.
I said,

218
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,380
why?
I said,

219
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,100
well,
you're,

220
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,320
you're too much energy.
You're flopping around.

221
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:33,080
It's no good.
You're bothering to customers as said.

222
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:33,810
Sure.
Okay.

223
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,160
Um,
but can you tell my friend,

224
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:37,030
my buddies over here,
he's also from Holland.

225
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,060
Okay.
Tell them that I'm gone because 

226
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,060
otherwise,
you know,

227
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,060
we,
uh,

228
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,380
can find me.
So they didn't expect that they,

229
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,210
they thought I was going to do something
of course.

230
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,980
So it pushes me and I said,
no,

231
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:49,170
why would you push me?
I say I want to go.

232
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,030
It's okay,
you know,

233
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,860
I don't want any trouble.
And he started pointing his finger in my

234
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:57,861
chest,
which is something I really can't stand 

235
00:09:57,861 --> 00:09:57,861
right.
So I said,

236
00:09:57,861 --> 00:09:58,440
okay,
don't touch me because if you know,

237
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,000
if you do that again,
it's going to go wrong.

238
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,470
And sure enough they were looking for a 
fight.

239
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:06,471
Of course he did it again.
So I pushed him and another guy behind 

240
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:07,730
him jumped over him and he stabbed the 
finger in.

241
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,550
I said,
guys,

242
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,980
come on,
let's stop this right now.

243
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:13,770
I don't want to book my other eye.
And there I went,

244
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,800
boom.
And that guy went down the went down 

245
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,290
like one point.
So I've never seen anything.

246
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,610
I heard him over to music.

247
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,170
That was the wildest thing ever.
And then they had these little 

248
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,170
microphones,
right?

249
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,170
So with the,
uh,

250
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,110
I don't know,
but fast there was like five guys,

251
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:33,350
four or five guys,
and they start finding,

252
00:10:33,351 --> 00:10:36,240
going to guided.
I knocked out constantly because he will

253
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:39,330
wake up right and everything went good 
and went good.

254
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:41,040
And,
but then I start realizing,

255
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,540
wait a minute,
this,

256
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,700
these guys are going to come back up all
the time.

257
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:46,540
You know,
this is going to come to an end.

258
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,230
They got to get the hell out of here.
So I just knocking them down.

259
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,580
So you're hitting them,
they're falling down.

260
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:51,920
Everyone that's coming out to you're 
knocking now,

261
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:53,490
but you're realizing you've got to get 
out of here.

262
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:55,680
I had to get out of there and as one 
part,

263
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,660
until this day,
I have no clue what this was.

264
00:10:57,661 --> 00:11:01,410
I am falling against a wall and there's 
a hole in the wall,

265
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,520
you know,
with the little,

266
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,040
um,
like bar in front of it.

267
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,040
And there is broomsticks broomsticks but
no brooms on broomsticks just so I'm 

268
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:13,350
grabbing one,
but right away when I grabbed one,

269
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,750
I think to myself,
I said,

270
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,770
if I grab one day,
going to grab one,

271
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,720
so I leave it at code,
but they passed it and they go,

272
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,270
oh,
you know,

273
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,140
fighting fire with broomsticks.
It was wild.

274
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:32,070
And then,
um,

275
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,440
I,
I had to go get the hell out of there.

276
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:37,620
So I went all the way down and I 
remember to this day it was a door that,

277
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:39,570
you know,
one of the discover things that you have

278
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:40,980
to push in.
And then it opened up.

279
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:43,560
So I click and it's closed and I'm 
going,

280
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:45,720
okay,
now what?

281
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,010
You know.
So I turned around to it.

282
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:47,670
I thought,
okay,

283
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:51,120
now I'm going to go only 40 ice.
I'm going to hit them into throat.

284
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,530
I'm going to kick him in the balls.

285
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,010
There's the only thing I'm going to go 
for now.

286
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:57,550
And they looked at me at all step back 
swagger wall.

287
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,680
They can see the business,
right?

288
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,100
But behind me is the whole police force 
side because there were windows.

289
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,670
So they uh,
they throw me in jail and uh,

290
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,880
because apparently one of those bonuses 
was a cop and yeah.

291
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:16,390
And I knocked him out of course also,
but he never told me that he was a god,

292
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:17,680
but I was,
I wouldn't have done that.

293
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,900
Anyway,
we're there.

294
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:24,901
And this is also,
this is actually a funny story because 

295
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,970
before this all happened,
I'm talking to my wife and I'm already 

296
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:26,970
tanked,
right?

297
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,050
She says,
why are you laughing when you have so 

298
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,050
much fun?
I said,

299
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,050
honey,
I'm drunk.

300
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,050
I'm having a lot of fun.
She's,

301
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,840
no,
your dad were too sweet.

302
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:32,890
Is Blonde Girls,
Huh?

303
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,400
Say I need.

304
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,780
Don't worry about it.
You know me if I'm drunk,

305
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:36,130
you know,
I don't care about anything.

306
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,220
Especially not that I just want to have 
fun.

307
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,670
So after two days they allow me to get 
my first phone call.

308
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,000
And I'm calling my wife and she's 
freaking out.

309
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:46,450
I said,
oh honey,

310
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:47,710
you got to be okay.
Relax,

311
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:52,711
relax,
and say I got some good and some bad 

312
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:52,711
news for you.
Want to hear first?

313
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:52,930
She says the good news.
I say,

314
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:58,020
identify two Swedish girls says,
this is a semi,

315
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Jill.
She's going to hate me for this story 

316
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,580
because every time it's funny.
I think that's a hell of a story.

317
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,370
A story.
That's an outstanding story.

318
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,850
So how did you get out of the country?
What happened?

319
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,150
You know what I'm.
I asked them if they press charges and 

320
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,180
they said no.
So I said,

321
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:23,830
okay,
I'm not going to press charges either.

322
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,700
But apparently they did press charges 
and then I had to go to court.

323
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,370
So I get this lawyer and also,
you know,

324
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,040
they drive me from the normal police 
station to jail.

325
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,290
Right.
This is like your mood,

326
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:40,090
your you drive into a mountain and the 
road stops in the middle of a month.

327
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,740
You get out of the elevator,
like do elevators.

328
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,050
I don't know.
By Goodwin elevate,

329
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,460
I'd go like four stories up.
I go out,

330
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,590
they can audit elevator,
go like to down,

331
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,390
go out,
take another to go like six.

332
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,510
So I go home,
I go,

333
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,320
where am I?
You know,

334
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,530
was some weird.
Jill with was sitting there with like 

335
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,230
murderers and rapists.
It was a wireless thing ever.

336
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:04,780
But all the older,
older guards knew me.

337
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,500
So I had a VCR,
I had coffee,

338
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,440
cookies,
I was playing cards with the guards.

339
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,000
They actually gave me my phone.
They said,

340
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,580
all right,
cool.

341
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,590
So then the lawyer comes to the lawyer,
goes,

342
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:18,130
I say,
okay.

343
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:19,570
So again,
I go,

344
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,560
you know,
and he said,

345
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:23,110
um,
well you probably got to get like six to

346
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:24,450
nine months.
I said,

347
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:25,970
well,
back up now.

348
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,000
I said,
what?

349
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,450
He says,
yeah,

350
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,410
one of them was a cop.
I see you're getting.

351
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,250
I said,
but they started it.

352
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,900
You said,
well there's five against one,

353
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:33,310
you know,
he can say anything.

354
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:35,700
So anyway,
it went to court and,

355
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:36,820
and um,
um,

356
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,220
my friends,
some friends in Sweden,

357
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:40,230
they started,
they talks,

358
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,790
apparently they talked to those guys and
I said,

359
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,790
man,
c'mon take you charged back.

360
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,130
And that's what they did.
And then,

361
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,000
oh wow.
Imagine six months.

362
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,470
Yeah,
that was weird man.

363
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:55,471
That was like a movie,
like a movie with the guy from 

364
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:55,471
highlander.
Remember he,

365
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:57,900
he made a movie one time in a jail 
somewhere really weird too.

366
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,000
Was in a mountain.
That's crazy.

367
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:04,340
And then the when,
when you had to lead you out,

368
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:05,430
you to go,
uh,

369
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,340
your,
your one hour a day.

370
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,270
It was like a circle and it was divided 
like,

371
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,330
like a pie,
like an eight and a.

372
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,680
But with the fans,
like usually fence like that in eight.

373
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,610
So you would,
you have a piece of Pie,

374
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:24,611
let's say you know that space to 
yourself from here to you to the wall 

375
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:27,840
there.
And then there's another guy right next 

376
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:27,840
to you that right there.
And you're not interacting with them.

377
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,330
You're not in the same jails.
Them.

378
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,770
You're not in the same cage as them?
No,

379
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:32,630
not in the same cage.
Everybody has their own room.

380
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:33,980
Yeah.
How weird.

381
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:34,730
That was.
Wild.

382
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,940
Yeah.
Scary stuff because it's funny now,

383
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,840
but it's really not sweet.

384
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,340
This is where it happened in Sweden,
in Sweden is the place where all this 

385
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,761
shit has gone down with Wiki leaks where
they're trying to put that guy in jail 

386
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:51,821
for rape because he had sex with a girl 
and the condom broke and he didn't tell 

387
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:51,890
her.
Sweden is a,

388
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:56,891
it's a strange place.
And they take like violence and crime 

389
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:56,891
very,
very seriously.

390
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:56,891
Okay.

391
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:58,890
They had a.
It is the suicide rate is the highest in

392
00:15:58,891 --> 00:15:59,920
the world.
Real.

393
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,200
Yeah.
Japan is too.

394
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:02,890
But Sweden is one I.
Wow.

395
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,050
Wow.
Why is that?

396
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,700
Why Sweden rock chicks are so hot that 
seems like that would cut back a lot.

397
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,420
You know what actually was killing 
themselves in Brazil.

398
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:13,680
The girls was ally.
We.

399
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,450
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

400
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,570
It's like we the flight over.
That was a funny story too because I 

401
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,780
would go my crazy friend from all right.
So we uh,

402
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,670
we,
we get tanked on the plane and,

403
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,020
and,
and he says,

404
00:16:25,021 --> 00:16:27,210
I got to go to the restroom.
And I said,

405
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:28,470
well don't you know,
but he,

406
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:32,010
he sits here the aisle next to me and he
sits on the other side.

407
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,720
He said,
well,

408
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,940
but they just turned the light on 
because we're lending.

409
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,080
I said,
what are you gonna do to get to stop the

410
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,040
playing and say go take man.

411
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,070
So he goes up and he's like walking up 
because we're going down.

412
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,260
He goes to the rest of my people 
complaining,

413
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:47,050
complaining,
you know?

414
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:51,120
And finally he comes back and he wants 
to get in this before nine slash 11.

415
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:52,430
Okay.
He wants to get in.

416
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,010
And I said,
no,

417
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,100
you can't go in.
And I looked at a frog and I see the 

418
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,740
pilot there.
This is true story of sweaters and a 

419
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:00,740
pilot at the doors open.
I say,

420
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,990
I want you and let you in if you go to 
the front and touch the pilots head.

421
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,640
And he says,
okay,

422
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,490
logging down here like this.
And he put his hand on.

423
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,630
Yeah,
on his head.

424
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,830
And people like,
Oh,

425
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,480
you can't do this with,
but not not as bad.

426
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:18,510
So for some reason they let us into the 
country.

427
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,700
That was the ones can you imagine

428
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,990
happens is now what are you gonna do?
You're gonna shoot.

429
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,020
You shut your eyes.
If you don't shut your cell phone off,

430
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:29,540
they'll put you in jail.
We'll pull,

431
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,660
turn the plane ride around and you know.
Wow.

432
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:34,910
So this was [inaudible] say 96,
97.

433
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,540
Remember when you could get on a plane 
with just.

434
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,880
You didn't even have yet to have a 
driver's license.

435
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,560
So you had to have.
Well you don't know why.

436
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,270
You didn't even have to have a driver's 
license.

437
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,550
I remember when you couldn't get away 
with nothing.

438
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,200
You just go on with a,
with a,

439
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,220
with a ticket.
That's what I meant when I was.

440
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,370
When I used to compete,
when I was doing taekwondo tournament,

441
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,270
we would fly all I had today,
I had a ticket,

442
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,540
I didn't have a driver's license.
They told me to Canada for a long time.

443
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,910
He could go with your driver's license 
to write to Canada,

444
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,530
Canada into Mexico.

445
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,540
But then the United States started being
Douche bags about it and you know,

446
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,590
they cut back on Mexicans and Canadians 
coming over here and so they made it 

447
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,090
more difficult and so Canada and Mexico 
made it more difficult too.

448
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:17,091
But yeah,
when I first used to go to Montreal 

449
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:17,091
comedy festival up there,
I didn't have a passport.

450
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,830
You that trouble at the border there all
the time in Canada.

451
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,830
Never for some reason they always get me
out.

452
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,370
I have no clue why that is.
I have your record to find your record.

453
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,770
I mean,
you,

454
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,100
if you have a um,
a salt lake,

455
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:32,190
like what happened,
but what happened in Sweden that was not

456
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:33,770
because they went to court and they 
threw it out.

457
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,780
It doesn't matter the fact that you got 
arrested and you went to court and all 

458
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:38,780
that and you were going to jail for a 
little bit.

459
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,230
Even if there's no charges that,
that,

460
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,630
that stick.
They still have that on your record.

461
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,530
Like Eddie Bravo got arrested once for 
legally having a gun.

462
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,660
He got pulled over for a traffic 
violation.

463
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:53,661
This one,
he was working for a check cashing 

464
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:55,400
company,
needs to carry around a big bag of cash 

465
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,070
with them and he had to carry a gun with
him and it was totally illegal,

466
00:18:56,071 --> 00:19:01,071
but he had done something like not 
stopping at a stop sign or something 

467
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:01,071
like that.
So they pull him over and he said,

468
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:01,980
I just want to let you know I have a 
gun,

469
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,780
a loaded gun in the car because I do 
this.

470
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,810
They arrested him.
They released him because you know,

471
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,460
it was all correct.
They chuck his paperwork.

472
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:09,660
It's all good.
It doesn't matter.

473
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,690
Every time he goes to Canada,
every single time he gets pulled aside 

474
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,520
and they check his shit and they asked 
him questions and it takes like an extra

475
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,520
hour and a half.
I got stuck with him the last time I 

476
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:22,520
went to and just knowing it's really 
annoying.

477
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:22,520
Yeah.
And he had no,

478
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:22,770
he had no record.
I mean he did nothing,

479
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,520
you know,
it never.

480
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:28,521
It never stuck as a record,
but just the fact that he was even 

481
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:28,521
arrested.
Yup.

482
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:29,310
Yeah.
Just big roided guy one time,

483
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,590
standing there all.

484
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,760
When you go to get any royalty in the 
bag,

485
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,340
swear to God.
I looked at him,

486
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,350
I said,
oh,

487
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:42,850
that's funny.
Yeah,

488
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,730
and I did that same line or nothing.
Seemed like twice.

489
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,250
Also in America.
I came back from Japan.

490
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,390
Same be the same guy.
He said,

491
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:54,510
you go to any Royce.
I've made.

492
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,990
Why do they asked me did ever ask?
You?

493
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,550
Always asked me Brian,
Tom,

494
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,020
but you get,
you know,

495
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,960
but on.
C'Mon man.

496
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,820
Girl who asked that.
Yeah.

497
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,870
That's the funny thing is you could say 
that roads are for faggots and he won't 

498
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,711
say anything because no guy on roids 
every once in midair on roids fucking 

499
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:20,480
most gigantic ridiculous human beings 
ever.

500
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,350
Not doing power lifting six meals a day.
How much pork?

501
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,030
What was it?
The guy took a Sarong.

502
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:29,480
No,
no,

503
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,670
no,
no,

504
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:30,430
no.
That's the wrong excuse.

505
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,150
The strongest men,
which now puts an asking.

506
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,380
They were saying that he ate like handy 
and Bacon.

507
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,440
What do you have?
A 12 pound of bacon or something like 

508
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:41,440
something.
He turned purple.

509
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,440
You see that guy when he fought him,
so he got purple color.

510
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

511
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,200
It's not good.
Good.

512
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:53,630
His body,
your body's not supposed to look like 

513
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:53,630
that.
It's not supposed to.

514
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,760
That is not a fighter's build.
You know,

515
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:59,761
when you see these guys,
there's guys in the UFC a lot of times 

516
00:20:59,761 --> 00:20:59,761
in their first couple of fights,
you'll see when they come in and they're

517
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:04,621
just too big.
It looks good and it might be good for 

518
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:07,651
the first 30 or 40 seconds you can,
you could really guerrilla fuck a guy 

519
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:10,360
for 30 or 40 seconds.
But then that lactic acid builds up

520
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,040
trashing.
Elvis said it,

521
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,650
I,
I,

522
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,200
I never cared about it and never get.
If somebody said,

523
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:17,880
oh,
he's on roids.

524
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,480
So you know,
to me it,

525
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:24,530
it is that you're insecure already.
You know there's something wrong with 

526
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,600
you because you're not happy with 
yourself.

527
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:30,610
Let's go to that.
And that bullshit thing that they say 

528
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:30,610
know.
But everybody does it.

529
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,320
I mean,
it's been saying I did this.

530
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,020
Um,
for the amateurs,

531
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,090
they,
you know,

532
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,220
did the camel.
I'm on the board of the camera and they 

533
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,220
asked me to go

534
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,630
for people.
No,

535
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,180
no.
The California,

536
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,310
a amateur mixed martial arts 
organization.

537
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:45,550
Yep.

538
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,310
And they asked me to speak to the guys,
you know,

539
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,130
to help him out in the future,
ones to a pro,

540
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,140
what to watch out for.
And then the last and most important 

541
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,861
thing,
what is the most important thing they 

542
00:21:58,861 --> 00:21:58,861
said?
I said,

543
00:21:58,861 --> 00:21:58,861
well,
don't do robots.

544
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,880
I mean if you,
if you already did Royce or are thinking

545
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,910
about doing words,
I mean you might as well stop your 

546
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,340
career because in this particular stage 
right now,

547
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:08,200
if you're already thinking about it,
you're going to fail.

548
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,790
You're going to be a loser because you 
want it.

549
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,120
I never got that.
And how dangerous it,

550
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,830
you know what?
I hear the EPO,

551
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,300
you know people doing that.
I go,

552
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:21,310
man,
doesn't that make your blood really 

553
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:21,310
think

554
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,640
right?
Very dangerous and very common by the 

555
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:23,640
way.
Yeah.

556
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:23,640
I'm guy.
Boxers had been caught with it.

557
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:23,650
Sugar.
Shane Mosley,

558
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:24,970
he got caught with it,
you know,

559
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
epo is what they always accused cyclists
of using who was a professional cyclist 

560
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,580
and he was on it and he said that when 
he was on a tour,

561
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:38,581
they were on a tour with a.
They would ride on a bus and then they 

562
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:39,700
would compete in these tournaments and 
he's a racist rather,

563
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,840
and you would hear guys in the middle of
the night on their bikes and go ride.

564
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:46,920
They had to hear the heart rate goes 
down or something.

565
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,680
Too much blood,
too much blood builds up in your body.

566
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:55,681
Because what,
what epo simulates is it's like 

567
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:55,681
artificial altitude,
you know,

568
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:59,820
like the effect that happens at altitude
where your blood thickens because you 

569
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,190
need more oxygen because it's a low 
oxygen environment.

570
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,700
So these guys and they take this epo,
they have to exercise.

571
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,730
Well I don't wake up at like 3:00
in the morning and they'll have their 

572
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:08,730
parts all fucked up and they got to get 
on a bike and go.

573
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,700
Yeah.
Otherwise you can't have a heart attack 

574
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:13,700
or something.
Yeah,

575
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:13,700
you could have strokes.
You can.

576
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,710
It's very dangerous.
I know mixed martial arts guys that have

577
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:16,810
done it and I know guys that have done 
it that,

578
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,840
you know,
their trainer found out like after the 

579
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:21,840
fight and they were like,
what the fuck man.

580
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,350
You,
you got to let us know that you're doing

581
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:25,000
this,
so if you get knocked out,

582
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,710
we can tell the doctor,
hey,

583
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:30,250
here's something you should consider.
This guy's on fucking epo,

584
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,680
you know,
use a pen as a syringe.

585
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:37,681
You know,
you need to evolve like this because 

586
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:37,681
it's so thick.
It's coming out.

587
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:38,240
Have a hug.

588
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,790
I was stuck into a Joe Mccarthy and as I
said,

589
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:41,800
you know what the new.
Oh No,

590
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:42,710
no.
He asked me,

591
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,460
he says,
you know what,

592
00:23:43,461 --> 00:23:44,930
the newest,
a druggist,

593
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,090
uh,
for fighting.

594
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:47,630
I said,
tell.

595
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,630
I said I'm fine.
And he goes,

596
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:51,980
how do you know that?
I say,

597
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:56,981
I read an article about it like a week 
before that and apparently guys are 

598
00:23:56,981 --> 00:24:01,451
doing that,
taking Viagra and apparently vegas one 

599
00:24:01,451 --> 00:24:02,780
of these wonder things,
it's really good for your kidneys,

600
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:04,280
for blood pressure,
for.

601
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:06,110
I mean,
I read an article in,

602
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:06,550
um,

603
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,970
yeah,
that's why I take fitness magazine and 

604
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,350
it was like raving about it.
So real good medicine apparently.

605
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:15,510
But can you imagine?
Well,

606
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,350
what it does is it increases your nitric
oxide and all those,

607
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,200
those supplements that people take,
you know,

608
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:22,720
nitric burn,
all these different nitric flood,

609
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:25,030
all these different things.
This is the exact same thing.

610
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:27,820
Increases your nitric oxide.
That's why your dick gets hard so quick.

611
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:30,920
Your muscles fucking flareup range gets 
baked stuff.

612
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,110
Definitely until it goes to the ground.
Then it'd be uncomfortable.

613
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,270
That's what I'm saying.
You know,

614
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,280
what are you doing to keep your cup?
It depends on if you have addicted could

615
00:24:41,471 --> 00:24:43,540
fit into one of those Japanese men of 
masturbation.

616
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,930
People might not even ever know.

617
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,720
It was funny.
One of the guys that you're one of the 

618
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,971
few guys that has gone through a mixed 
martial arts career and has successfully

619
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,950
brought a transition to a broadcasting 
career.

620
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,170
I mean you,
you made you,

621
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,600
you're very smart in how you handled it 
because first of all,

622
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,780
he didn't take too many fights.
You didn't go with your ego and have 

623
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,071
fights after you weren't where you were 
busy with other things or weren't fully 

624
00:25:14,071 --> 00:25:14,920
concentrated on it.
You stepped away and full health,

625
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,480
you know,
how'd you manage to do that?

626
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,120
Not full health,
not full health.

627
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,010
Knees were bothering me and the one of 
the worst thing to have is tendinitis in

628
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:26,650
both my arms.
And if that hits,

629
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,970
if that starts then it's you.
I take fish.

630
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,820
Oil Helps.
Did you at.

631
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,160
I've ever had.
I can either both here in the arms 

632
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,830
upstairs and if it hits it's about a 45 
minutes hour a brain which is 

633
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,230
unimaginable.
It's like,

634
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,550
yeah,
you have no clue.

635
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:49,600
It's like coming from the outside.
It's like you can't describe it.

636
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:51,700
There's no pain like it and there's 
nothing you can do.

637
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:53,590
You can take pain pills for it.
Nothing.

638
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,080
I have to write it.
I would lose weight,

639
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,090
you know?
So when I made a comeback in 2000,

640
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:01,120
six,
six weeks before it hated,

641
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,360
you know,
I had nine weeks to prepare I think two 

642
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:06,820
times,
three times,

643
00:26:06,821 --> 00:26:11,821
five days I took off that.
I literally only work my legs because I 

644
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:15,370
had the tendonitis and then because you 
lose weight from the pain.

645
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,840
And then I started realizing,
okay,

646
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:20,020
this is the reason that I stopped 
because it's not fun anymore.

647
00:26:20,021 --> 00:26:20,980
You know,
you're in the grant.

648
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:22,030
Everything hurts.
I was,

649
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:25,500
I was rolling with a in Eddie's class 
and uh,

650
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,380
with the Goliath,
you remember the big guy there and I was

651
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:34,381
going to finally a Bolo and um,
Chemo Leopoldo Kimra follow and uh,

652
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,820
he very much looks like him,
like built to make it a role with you 

653
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,780
because I need to just get up and just 
strike,

654
00:26:40,781 --> 00:26:43,680
get a stroke.
And I had tendinitis and I met,

655
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:45,900
everything was hurting and I could see 
everybody looked like,

656
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:47,220
oh,
is this bus routes in you?

657
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,690
So I go,
okay,

658
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,020
my police me,
you know,

659
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,160
so I got his number of five days later.
I said two Fridays offset come back 

660
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,530
again.
And he was like,

661
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,880
Whoa,
what's going on now?

662
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,920
Because it's a whole different ballgame.
But.

663
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:02,190
So that means that every,
every time when you train with that,

664
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,500
it man,
it,

665
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,470
it's so much pain that yeah,
you'll lose weight.

666
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:08,680
She can't eat,
you know,

667
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:10,130
you have tears in your eyes from the 
paintings.

668
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,660
Wow.
And so what exactly is tendinitis?

669
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:14,040
What is it?
What is it from?

670
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,970
I have no clue.

671
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,970
And,
and you know what I,

672
00:27:15,971 --> 00:27:19,910
I realized that began early days when I 
did track and field.

673
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,540
I already had it there.
I think that it comes from all the 

674
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:25,740
cortisones that I took.
I was a very sick,

675
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,330
get bad asthma,
bad eczema everywhere.

676
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:34,331
And they gave me a lot cortisones 
cohorts were afraid something was going 

677
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:35,360
to happen at the end and the.
And that has an effect.

678
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:36,950
I hear when your skeleton,
you know,

679
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:38,330
it melts,
they say.

680
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,740
But I guess if it's,

681
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,650
I could have some attendance.
Right.

682
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,970
Wow,
that's crazy.

683
00:27:43,971 --> 00:27:46,610
So you were,
you were a sick kid and you transitioned

684
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,910
somehow into a martial arts champion.
Wild.

685
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Right.
Did you start training really hard 

686
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:53,920
because of your sickness because of your
asthma is one of them?

687
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,500
I,
I,

688
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,430
I got bullied in love.
I,

689
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,140
I was a very lonely kid.
I was,

690
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,720
I was in the trees.
I will,

691
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,120
I had a really cool skill.
I could climb in a tree in the forest 

692
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,260
and I could like 45 percent of the 
forest.

693
00:28:09,261 --> 00:28:12,110
I go call from treetop to treat that.
I would start to swing it.

694
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,140
Yeah,
why?

695
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,540
They would follow them if they would 
come and so they would go after you and 

696
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:23,900
you would jump from tree to tree,
like a monkey to get away from them.

697
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,570
That's what I did.
And a few of them fell,

698
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,340
you know,
one was almost a,

699
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:29,400
almost didn't make it,
you know,

700
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,490
I mean his hat fell like next door were 
rock,

701
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,190
but that scared everybody so much that,
that was my harbor,

702
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:36,050
that was my safe harbor.

703
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:41,050
You know,
every time something happens I just 

704
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,611
climbed a tree was there.
But I think that that's where I got my 

705
00:28:42,611 --> 00:28:43,600
athleticism from just climbing,
climbing all the time.

706
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,740
Yeah,
that's fucking crazy.

707
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,410
It's amazing how many mixed martial 
artists were bullied.

708
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,160
You know?
I mean,

709
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,760
people look at a guy like you and they 
would go,

710
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:52,280
well,
there's no fucking way this guy was ever

711
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:57,281
bullied.
It's amazing how much of that happens 

712
00:28:57,281 --> 00:28:57,281
and what the fuck.
I mean,

713
00:28:57,281 --> 00:28:58,400
how do you stop that shit from happening
in school?

714
00:28:58,401 --> 00:29:03,401
I know you're involved in a lot of anti 
bullying programs and I've seen you do 

715
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:04,490
public service announcements and stuff 
like that.

716
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,820
How do you stop that in school?
You can,

717
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,550
you,
um,

718
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,500
you know,
and it's,

719
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,580
it's hard.
You have to make sure that the,

720
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,150
that the whole school knows,
like I will do it.

721
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:21,620
How do you say that?
I would tell there if I,

722
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:23,060
if I would speak in front of those 
people,

723
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,630
that the bullies that there,
we got to have sympathy for those guys.

724
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:32,020
I mean,
it was obviously something's wrong with 

725
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,020
them.
They only can team up,

726
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,220
you know,
to get somebody and they pick the 

727
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,220
weakest guy.
I mean,

728
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,101
seriously,
if you guys think does a school that's 

729
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:39,101
the biggest

730
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:40,860
loser of the whole school.
And I think that human nature thing,

731
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,100
it really is,
it's like

732
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,100
they probably get beat at home,
you know,

733
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,600
and if you start talking like that,
but hopefully it rings a bell,

734
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,580
but the bullying because otherwise she 
can stop this,

735
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:49,640
you know,
uh,

736
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,020
you hear every now and then about guys 
who are fighters who are bullies.

737
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,890
You know who,
uh,

738
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:58,891
you hear about bullying in the gym,
guys who were really good fucking other 

739
00:29:58,891 --> 00:30:00,840
guys up like young guys and little walk 
about Hector Lombard,

740
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,660
you know,
I don't know if it's true,

741
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:06,661
but you hear a lot of stories about him 
beating the shit out of young guys and 

742
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:06,661
hurting people,
you know,

743
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:09,400
and you know that that has to be 
something from their childhood.

744
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,170
It just has to.
Something happened there.

745
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,550
Yeah,
it's scary stuff.

746
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,070
You would think that a guy who's a 
trained fighter though,

747
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:16,610
you would think,
well that's like,

748
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,750
that would be my solution.
Like how do you get bullying out of the 

749
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:21,750
schools?
I really think you should teach kids how

750
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,660
to fight.
I don't think they should have to fight,

751
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,500
but I think,
you know,

752
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:25,780
offer it in physical education,
offer it.

753
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:30,781
Because for a man,
it's one of the most important things 

754
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:30,781
you could ever learn for developing your
character,

755
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:34,570
for being just me being more confident 
and getting out aggression.

756
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,520
So you can think things more clearly.

757
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,710
I,
we,

758
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,600
we at Ktl a this morning in a gym and it
was a,

759
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:41,520
I was Frank Shepherd.

760
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,640
If people don't know you have a great 
gym in thousand oaks.

761
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:46,110
And how do people get there?
What is,

762
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,180
where's the,
what's the name of it?

763
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,380
It's a bas rutten's elite mma.
It's an 80,

764
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,600
Eighty Hampshire road

765
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,700
in thousand dollars though.
This is a rare opportunity if you live 

766
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,060
in this area to train with,
you know,

767
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,290
a true legend.
And apparently,

768
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:04,430
and I'm everyday there,
I'm teaching every day so it's not like 

769
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,130
my name is under Jim and I'm not there.
I don't like this,

770
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,060
you know.
So ktl KTL labels with Jim.

771
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,470
Frank Shamrock was said Jim,
my friend,

772
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:13,470
hope mckellen need the guy from lights 
out to the new TV show on Fx.

773
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,980
Great show and boxing shows.
Yeah,

774
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,790
a heavyweight champion,
you know,

775
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:20,420
and now he's got to cope with all the 
problems,

776
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:25,430
you know,
the money is gone and it's got a little 

777
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:25,740
bit soprano's meets rocky meat,
you know,

778
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:28,410
like serious like that.
And um,

779
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,450
and yeah,
all of us were bullied also.

780
00:31:30,451 --> 00:31:32,700
Frank also was a little fat kid.
He said,

781
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,170
and then he also,
because he went to boarding school in,

782
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:36,080
in,
in Scotland,

783
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,160
his father send them over there.
He was the only American there,

784
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:41,070
so that Brown and with me also.
It's A.

785
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:46,350
Yeah,
because of the actually mine and all of 

786
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:46,350
my um,
uh,

787
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,820
asthma and Eczema.
Yeah.

788
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:51,030
And it had,
had to that how they fix that.

789
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,950
I grew over there.
You know what the weirdest thing is when

790
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,970
I,
when I stepped into the states when I 

791
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:57,970
was fighting and pancreas,
if you see some fights,

792
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,571
you know,
you'll see I still have everywhere have 

793
00:32:02,571 --> 00:32:02,571
spots,
you know,

794
00:32:02,571 --> 00:32:05,040
and when I came into America I think 
within a month everything.

795
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:08,340
I mean you sort of almost disappearing.
I was gone.

796
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,880
I think also the climate maybe has 
something to do with California climate.

797
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:12,750
Yeah.
I love it.

798
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,430
This is actually,
it's not too hot,

799
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,230
not too dry.
You know,

800
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:15,690
it's,
it's,

801
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,500
it's perfect.
It's pretty good place.

802
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,020
And yeah,
we just said it right.

803
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,220
It's pretty awesome here.
When people in Minnesota freezing their 

804
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:25,220
dicks off.
Like I said,

805
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,451
I came into the states and say,
why doesn't everybody in America live 

806
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:30,430
here?
There's no houses,

807
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,900
there's a lot of people there,
there's a lot of people.

808
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,680
So,
um,

809
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:37,880
so you didn't exactly transition out 
without any pain that.

810
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,740
So that was one of the reasons you,
uh,

811
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:39,970
you

812
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,900
cut your,
you're fighting

813
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,560
tendonitis.
Yep.

814
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,050
Yep.
That and my knees.

815
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:49,051
I have no cartilage in my knee caps,
which sounds as a very easy thing to 

816
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:52,060
fix,
but in reality is the worst problem.

817
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:53,500
And he can have,
I mean,

818
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,030
Chicago Bridge in between the knees when
a boss,

819
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,770
they can do something about that,
you know,

820
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,890
but cottage on the kneecap,
they can't.

821
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,800
My friend has his knees resurface,
Deanna resurface with steel.

822
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,550
They put some sort of a steel or 
titanium plate over the knee.

823
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:12,790
My friend Steve was on the US ski team 
back in the eighties and he fucked his 

824
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,190
knees up really,
really bad.

825
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,460
Like he's had I believe,
16 or 17 surgeries on his knees and 

826
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,550
they're mangled and they just recently 
put artificial meniscus in place.

827
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,500
This like white padded stuff in between 
the knees and his cartilage is so chewed

828
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:30,740
up that they actually re resurfaced it 
with metal.

829
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,890
So he has like it,
like it's a crazy looking thing man.

830
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:36,150
It's like metal,
like on top of kneecap.

831
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:41,170
I have it here somewhere in my email.
I'll find it for you before we leave 

832
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:41,170
tonight so you can check it out.
But.

833
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,130
So there,
there is a solution that

834
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,250
my friends do,
you know,

835
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:44,490
it's uh,
it's hard.

836
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,470
They get,
for instance,

837
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:47,480
they can put the kneecap is in constant 
motion,

838
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:52,570
you know,
so it's not like you can put something 

839
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:52,570
on there and then because it gets read 
off right away again,

840
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,500
what it can do is drill a hole in there.
And then um,

841
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,910
I put a teflon played in it.
But then at that if you drilled a hole 

842
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,960
and he becomes 35 percent more weeks,
so you have way more chance to break me.

843
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,770
And once you break your kneecap,
you know,

844
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,180
that's why it was my doctor said that's 
why they,

845
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:12,260
the is they break your kneecaps because 
that's like the worst thing to do to 

846
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,260
somebody.

847
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah,
the knees are brutal,

848
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:14,690
man.
I've had,

849
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,270
I've had three knee operations.
I had um,

850
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,820
my,
uh,

851
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,220
my left acl reconstructed my meniscus 
scope to my left,

852
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,090
my left knee here.
I've got a picture of it here.

853
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:25,070
If you want to check it out,
check this out real quick.

854
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,820
See that.
This is a resurfacing.

855
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:32,420
This is where they took his cartilage 
was so fucked up.

856
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,500
I took it off and they resurfaced it 
with steel and this white stuff in this 

857
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,510
picture.
This is the,

858
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,980
uh,
artificial meniscus.

859
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:42,560
I'll put this picture on twitter later 
on.

860
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:47,561
So what else?
Pretty fucking Korea and the stuff that 

861
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:49,190
they can do nowadays.
It's bizarre.

862
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,900
Yeah,
it's pretty fucking crazy.

863
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,470
I don't know.
Uh,

864
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,280
I mean this is really new stuff that 
they're doing,

865
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,770
but I mean his knee looks like it looks 
like.

866
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:59,540
And how does he feel?
It feels great.

867
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,140
He's the wildest motherfucker I've ever 
met.

868
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:08,141
He was a flight surgeon.
He's in his fifties and he's still 

869
00:35:08,141 --> 00:35:08,141
trying to fight.
It was crazy.

870
00:35:08,141 --> 00:35:08,450
It's out of his mind.

871
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,600
You use it.
It's a very hard thing to step away 

872
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:13,600
from,
you know,

873
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:13,600
to come back to it.
It's very.

874
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,180
But when I have students of mine or 
friends of my fighting,

875
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,740
it's way more nervous than they are.
It's like because you can't control it.

876
00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:21,610
It's like sitting next to the driver,
you know,

877
00:35:21,611 --> 00:35:22,870
and they go fast.
You go like,

878
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,000
I rather have the wheel,
so I'm in control here,

879
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,570
you know,
and that's um,

880
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,410
now it's hard because there's no feeling
like it,

881
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:34,470
like when you win or when you for six or
eight weeks you work on like five 

882
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,030
special combinations,
you know,

883
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:38,650
under ground and standing and then to 
see if,

884
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,000
if you get land one of those and then 90
percent of the time you do,

885
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,920
you know,
it's something that you really worked on

886
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,160
and then you let that thing and then 
it's like a hole in one.

887
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:49,830
I guess that's what I always say,
it has to be feeling like that.

888
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,290
Yeah.
I think much crazier than that.

889
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:54,710
I think that it's just the ultimate 
gamble.

890
00:35:54,711 --> 00:35:59,711
You know,
you're out there throwing your bones at 

891
00:35:59,711 --> 00:36:02,181
some guy trying to,
trying to hit his vital areas and it 

892
00:36:02,181 --> 00:36:04,320
ain't just a regular guy,
it's a fucking expert and he's doing the

893
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:09,321
exact same thing and so much of your 
success is based on how much dedication 

894
00:36:09,321 --> 00:36:10,140
you have,
how much time you put in,

895
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,680
how much you can keep your shit together
under pressure was the ultimate high,

896
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:15,270
right when you,
when is the ultimate high?

897
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,500
It really is.

898
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,770
And,
and what you say,

899
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,580
the,
the thing is,

900
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,620
can you always say,
can you bring the Dojo the way you fight

901
00:36:24,621 --> 00:36:28,070
and train there and spar there?
Can you bring that game

902
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,860
to the ring?
Because I can get the problem.

903
00:36:29,861 --> 00:36:32,250
That's the thing that is a big thing on 
depression.

904
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,190
Oh yeah.
You had a lot of guys fold,

905
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:37,030
like you'll see them,
they'll,

906
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:38,580
they'll,
they'll do great and they'll do.

907
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,620
There'll be like dominating and then the
guy will still be there.

908
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,390
Yeah.
And then you see the adversity,

909
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:45,700
you see doubt.
You see all kinds of creepy things about

910
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,220
whatever the fuck Hans,
their subconscious,

911
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:49,830
whatever the fuck is in their 
personality,

912
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,550
they don't like.
Can you see it?

913
00:36:51,551 --> 00:36:52,570
Surface most of the

914
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,650
time is that you,
you,

915
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,250
you see a guy when you get hit them at a
hard shot,

916
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,940
you know,
and it's most of them to muscular guys 

917
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:01,940
by the way to get up.
And uh,

918
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,190
the big blown up dudes when they hit 
somebody with their best bang and the 

919
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,101
guy recovers and comes back and then you
see him go down or they haven't met a 

920
00:37:10,101 --> 00:37:13,390
submission and they think they had them.
And then the guy has capes,

921
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,700
you know,
that's like a mental break for them and 

922
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:18,700
they give up.
It's like the weirdest thing.

923
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:18,700
You go like,
Whoa,

924
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:23,370
man is so good.
I know so many fighters were real who 

925
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:23,370
are like that,
and I just do it again.

926
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,200
Do it again and make it a little bit 
more tight.

927
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,370
Why wouldn't you do that?
You know,

928
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,180
but not to give up.

929
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:32,270
The fear of losing is a tremendous 
burden that a lot of guys have and 

930
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,080
eventually manifests itself in a fight.
It's like they're so afraid of losing 

931
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,970
their so afraid of fucking up that it 
just,

932
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,280
it just,
they make it happen.

933
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:43,570
It's afraid of losing in front of an 
audience because they have to listen to 

934
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,190
what those people going to tell them 
what,

935
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:46,330
you should've done this and Chris leave 
and said,

936
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,740
it's really funny.
A long time ago,

937
00:37:47,741 --> 00:37:51,100
he says,
you got knocked out by a silver and um,

938
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,520
and he said,
um,

939
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,940
it,
it's bad if you go to the blockbuster 

940
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,180
and the Guy Behind the desk tells you 
what you should have done,

941
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,340
you know,
because everybody knows better.

942
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,290
And that's horrible.
And that's why I always say,

943
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,630
I say you fight for yourself.
You say,

944
00:38:04,631 --> 00:38:05,020
oh,
boxer,

945
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:06,850
you fight for your family,
your wife and your kids.

946
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:11,851
No,
I fight for me because that takes a lot 

947
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:11,851
of pressure off because we really think 
about this.

948
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:12,160
And,
and if,

949
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,150
if you ever fellow fighter and you go 
both into a room,

950
00:38:16,151 --> 00:38:17,920
you lock the door,
you guys fight.

951
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,260
Do you really care?
If you lose,

952
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,200
I don't think I really care.
I love to win,

953
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,380
but you know,
I don't.

954
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,270
I don't know.
You know,

955
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:27,370
he's the best man.
That day he won that fight.

956
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:32,580
Now if it's in front of an audience,
you've got to go through all that bs 

957
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:32,580
that these,
these other people say,

958
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,930
well have no clue what it's all about.
But just see.

959
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,310
I mean it's all you fighting

960
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,020
for those people and it's so much 
pressure.

961
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:40,710
That's why I stay away from the.
I'm going to read this head of I'm going

962
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,720
to do disciplinary that because all that
they will play.

963
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,940
At the moment.
You walked through the cage and you hear

964
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:48,400
yourself saying that what you're going 
to do hand,

965
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:49,150
right?
Oh yeah,

966
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:54,151
because that's why I never did that 
because she put a lot of pressure on 

967
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:54,151
you.
Now I better do what I said.

968
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:55,510
Guys,
I don't think guys realize it,

969
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:58,090
but you see it in their face sometimes.
When I step into the octagon,

970
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:00,400
you see all the shit talking they've 
said and they're like,

971
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,080
here we go.
Like wow,

972
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:04,750
one of my fucking done does own.
There's a few shit.

973
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:07,360
Talkers were actually really good.
You know,

974
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:12,390
Chael Sonnen is pretty good at.
That was pretty good at it to George.

975
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,910
Vanessa's really good to.

976
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:14,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

977
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:16,660
There's a few guys,
if you guys have noticed,

978
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:22,090
guy show frank shamrock was good at a 
swat commerce bank and made a whole 

979
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,100
career out of it also,
you know,

980
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,590
you know,
and everybody's,

981
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,950
as I said,
those are not the guys that you see.

982
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:28,180
You know,
they're playing a smart game.

983
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:29,320
Nick Ds.
Yeah.

984
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,250
Yeah.
He loves it.

985
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,190
He loves it and he's a,
he's a really nice guy.

986
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,160
I like him lot.
Well he gets fired up though when he 

987
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,160
fights,
when he fights is now such a nice guy.

988
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,590
Yeah.
So that's the way psychological warfare 

989
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:43,590
is a part of finding,
right?

990
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:47,490
That's it.
Who can I always say who's got the 

991
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:47,490
biggest balls?
Who can,

992
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:47,490
you know,
keep going,

993
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:52,380
keep on going.
That's why I always say stamina is the 

994
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,171
one number one thing.
You know that that's one thing they can 

995
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:55,171
ever say for me and my mma career.

996
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:58,660
Never run out of gas because that's the 
only thing you can control,

997
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,660
you know when you train,
go run an extra hill,

998
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,700
glue something for calmer,
they're losing.

999
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,940
How difficult was that for you though 
when you started to get the tendinitis?

1000
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:09,640
Because you know there's like a,
their stamina from,

1001
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,430
from grappling that you probably 
couldn't get.

1002
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:17,431
Like I know for a fact that Toc ecosoc a
fight when you fought soccer when you 

1003
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:17,431
won the title,
right?

1004
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:18,040
That's what you want to title?
No,

1005
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,470
that was your first fight title from 
random randleman when you,

1006
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:25,471
when you are fuck Osaka,
you had a problem like you couldn't do 

1007
00:40:25,471 --> 00:40:26,380
any grappling for awhile or I didn't 
have a neck problem or a neck problem.

1008
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:29,350
I get the guest to Daryl Goler,
the wrestler.

1009
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Very good.
I get them in a triangle at the gym and 

1010
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,860
he lifted me up and he slammed me now 
with my neck into the corner.

1011
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,450
Yeah.
That took a long time.

1012
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:42,460
Gut knows the whole thing.
I just had surgery comes from that all 

1013
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,030
the way back and that was the injury.
What did,

1014
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,250
what was it was.
I have no clue.

1015
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,980
But it was so painful.
I had a daughter at the time,

1016
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:52,270
she was nine months old and she could 
not lay on my chest.

1017
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,290
I was coughing and everything would,
I would.

1018
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:00,600
It was funny because that is big syringe
of light o'kane and I'm injecting myself

1019
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,010
in between my ribs.
All my God.

1020
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:05,350
The UFC comes in with the cameras.
Right.

1021
00:41:05,351 --> 00:41:10,351
And that was at the time with the movie 
with universal soldier and these guys 

1022
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,740
are freaking out,
you know?

1023
00:41:11,741 --> 00:41:12,240
I said,
no,

1024
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,470
no.
I said,

1025
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,230
this is,
you know,

1026
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,930
Moses,
Lydell King is dangerous shit.

1027
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,170
Yeah.
But you go,

1028
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:23,230
you have to watch out for it to do.
But if they do with it all the way home 

1029
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,910
because they can't feel where it is.
But I had to between every rip I see.

1030
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,400
You have to do it yourself.
Yeah.

1031
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,480
That was painful.
Lidocaine is like the gay cousin of 

1032
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,070
cocaine just numbs things

1033
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,420
up.
When I got my nose fixed,

1034
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:37,640
I got a deviated septum fixed and they 
squirt.

1035
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:42,641
Lidl came up there when they're cleaning
it out so it doesn't freak you out 

1036
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:43,130
because they go up and your nose with a 
vacuum cleaner.

1037
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:43,850
It's like,
you know,

1038
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:47,450
when your vacuum your car at the carwash
and it gets stuck on the floor,

1039
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:51,110
mat goes,
that happens to the back of your fucking

1040
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:56,111
skull,
right where your brain is when they're 

1041
00:41:56,111 --> 00:41:56,450
cleaning up blood clots and you know,
and,

1042
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,570
and try to boogers and shit.
And they spray lidacain up there.

1043
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:02,870
And I felt fucked up for the whole day.
Like I was like,

1044
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:04,580
what is wrong with me?
I'm like out of it.

1045
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:05,510
And I realized,
oh,

1046
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,970
that Lidacain.
So then that go online and I'm like,

1047
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:10,760
what is the effects of light again?
People fucking die from it.

1048
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,450
Girls that put it on their legs,
when they go to get their legs lasered,

1049
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,550
they get the uh,
the hair lasered off their legs.

1050
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:18,830
It's painful.
So they cover their legs,

1051
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:21,560
would lie to Cain.
Some girl died in her fucking car,

1052
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:26,710
she covered her legs and Lidacain and 
then wrapped her legs up and she just 

1053
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,060
odd,

1054
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:27,640
oh,
a,

1055
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,290
a.
and you're shooting it into your ribs?

1056
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,140
In my rich,
I,

1057
00:42:31,141 --> 00:42:36,141
I used to many times that I would go to 
the fight and then Monday I had my 

1058
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:38,120
wrestling shoes because we have to wear 
shoes at bankwest.

1059
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:43,450
They will be open,
like I had an ankle injury and I will 

1060
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,031
wait until they called my name because 
one time I broke my hand the knuckle and

1061
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:47,210
they said,
oh,

1062
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:50,030
we put a light again in there and it's 
going to work for like an hour,

1063
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:52,220
but it's not,
it's like 15 minutes,

1064
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:53,600
you know,
especially when your heart rate is up,

1065
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:58,601
it goes really fast.
So at the moment I stepped into the 

1066
00:42:58,601 --> 00:42:58,601
ring,
I go like,

1067
00:42:58,601 --> 00:42:58,690
oh no,
it's back,

1068
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,530
you know,
they're not going to do this again,

1069
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,850
you know.
So I did it on,

1070
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,830
at the moment they would call my name,
I would put,

1071
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,910
put it in and then hopefully I was not 
going to feel it far.

1072
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,390
Yeah.

1073
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,880
So you were fighting online to Keynes,
he shooted in you and then fight,

1074
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:12,110
right.

1075
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,390
The walk.
You know,

1076
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,000
I,
I,

1077
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:19,001
uh,
I made a really bad trip when I was 

1078
00:43:19,001 --> 00:43:22,531
running the day before I jumped on the 
plane and it was against Vernon tiger 

1079
00:43:22,531 --> 00:43:25,831
white,
it was like my fourth fight or 

1080
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:25,831
something,
some other and,

1081
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:25,831
and it's like,
it's unbelievable.

1082
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:28,960
He takes me down and he goes for a toe 
hold in that ankle.

1083
00:43:28,961 --> 00:43:29,470
Like,
I mean,

1084
00:43:29,471 --> 00:43:31,170
it's like I'm sending out a signal,
you know,

1085
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:34,600
take this weird signal because whenever 
I get a tattoo,

1086
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,870
somebody fucking slaps me tattoo.
It's always,

1087
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,780
if you have an injury here where you 
never get hit,

1088
00:43:40,781 --> 00:43:42,670
if you're far,
you're going to get hit there.

1089
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,430
And that's it.

1090
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,350
Did you hurt your hand?
For sure someone's going to squeeze it.

1091
00:43:46,351 --> 00:43:51,351
When they shake is a lot of times you go
a whole year without a guide giving you 

1092
00:43:52,411 --> 00:43:57,411
one of those douchey handshakes,
handshakes where he grabs the tip of 

1093
00:43:57,411 --> 00:43:58,890
your fault.
Fuck,

1094
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:01,980
is that about insecure?
You'll go a year for the data,

1095
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,930
but if you hurt your hand,
it's right away.

1096
00:44:03,931 --> 00:44:05,220
That's the first thing that's going to 
happen.

1097
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:05,610
He goes,
wait,

1098
00:44:05,611 --> 00:44:05,940
is that right?

1099
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,480
Fucking strain.
It's the same.

1100
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:09,280
You got two lines.
She always picked the line.

1101
00:44:09,281 --> 00:44:11,830
That's the longest way.
This one is way longer.

1102
00:44:11,831 --> 00:44:12,820
You take the shortest

1103
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,250
calculus for a break and I'm fucking 
replacement comes in.

1104
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:17,480
They gotta Redo the register.
Yeah,

1105
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:19,220
and a check though.
The old grandmother,

1106
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:20,070
you know,
to all.

1107
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,650
What is the title?
How much again?

1108
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:22,220
Oh,
oh,

1109
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:23,300
sorry.
I got taken out.

1110
00:44:23,301 --> 00:44:25,240
I won.
When I see people paying with checks,

1111
00:44:25,241 --> 00:44:30,241
I'm like,
why don't you just fucking whip out 

1112
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:30,241
beaver pelts?
I cannot.

1113
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:30,380
Then I saw one the other day at the 
grocery store.

1114
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,850
Gets like,
you're still using this.

1115
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,920
That's where I.
Last time I saw too was at the grocery 

1116
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,390
store checks people allow you to just 
write on a piece of paper.

1117
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:38,830
Burton.
Yeah,

1118
00:44:38,831 --> 00:44:42,970
the big Lebowski.
But he pays like 70 nights that milk,

1119
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,980
the opening movie.
So if you didn't have all these 

1120
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,041
injuries,
do you think you would have kept going 

1121
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:54,781
or do you think?
I think I would have kept going a few 

1122
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:56,881
more.
A few more years she had because it was 

1123
00:44:56,881 --> 00:44:56,920
not a problem.
Not having stamina and you know,

1124
00:44:56,921 --> 00:44:59,760
always been very blessed with my body.
You know,

1125
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,760
and people look at me now the whole time
until I got how much you're trained.

1126
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:05,560
Well,
I didn't try and for a year,

1127
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,330
you know,
it's like I,

1128
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,170
I've just genetically put together 
because of my dad.

1129
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,760
My brother has the same.
He's a lawyer,

1130
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:15,430
but he say he's got no fat,
just good.

1131
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,970
Just good base.
So jeans.

1132
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,190
Yeah,
to all athletes.

1133
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,420
The root site,
you know,

1134
00:45:19,421 --> 00:45:22,450
so yeah.
Never had a problem with that.

1135
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:28,140
The question,
the question was whether or not you 

1136
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,140
would keep going.

1137
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,140
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1138
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,770
Because like I said,
it's nothing like it,

1139
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:33,730
but at the moment the,
the fun is gone out of training.

1140
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:38,820
Training will be so much fun for me 
because you know somebody every time 

1141
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:38,880
you,
you know,

1142
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,410
when you roll,
every time something pops up.

1143
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,280
Oh God,
that's cool man.

1144
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:48,790
There's some new thing and then you 
started using a lot of people and Works 

1145
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:48,880
and Works and Works and works on my God,
this is great.

1146
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:53,881
You know,
and every time a new little tears or 

1147
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:54,610
somebody shows you another little thing 
like a guillotine choke,

1148
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,640
do it like this because they can escape.
No surgical pain painting show to me.

1149
00:45:57,641 --> 00:45:57,880
I go,
Whoa,

1150
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:58,510
Whoa,
whoa.

1151
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,730
It's like bizarre things and you know,
and it's so cool.

1152
00:46:03,731 --> 00:46:08,731
But then the way you have the pain the 
whole time it takes the pleasure out of 

1153
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:09,570
it and why she have no more fun.
What's the use case?

1154
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,980
So you can't roll it all right now.
No,

1155
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:12,400
no.
I know.

1156
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:13,600
Especially just after my surgery.

1157
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,640
Regular.
This surgery is the same surgery from 

1158
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:18,640
the dowel goal.
Our incident that you just had.

1159
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,780
I don't know.
I think it added on maybe.

1160
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:21,290
You know,

1161
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,980
that was the first time it got hurt 
though.

1162
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,840
Yeah,
I think.

1163
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:25,560
What was the actual surgery would they 
have done

1164
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,210
between c four or five?
Five or six?

1165
00:46:28,211 --> 00:46:33,211
My nurse or flat squashed.
So I lost atrophied my whole arm and 

1166
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:38,610
shoulder.
So now they honed to holes open around 

1167
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:38,610
it.
They may,

1168
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,440
so the nerves are,
they can breathe again.

1169
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,730
So a lot of guys get that.
Joe Say Aldo just got that.

1170
00:46:43,731 --> 00:46:48,590
He has a nerve issue as well as numb.
And Carlin Carlin had it as well.

1171
00:46:48,591 --> 00:46:50,060
He just had surgery on.
Carlin did.

1172
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,210
Oh my God.
That for Jose Aldo based,

1173
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:55,800
one of my favorite guys as good.
That's not good man.

1174
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:59,340
This is a bad injury because this is 
gonna take a long time.

1175
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,130
I mean this is over two months ago and 
I,

1176
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,210
I,
I noticed things like I can push a,

1177
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:10,250
brushed my teeth the harder,
a little bit harder when I watch other 

1178
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,420
my armpit or I can shave my whole head 
now with a razor blade,

1179
00:47:12,421 --> 00:47:14,230
which I couldn't do before.
Things like that.

1180
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:17,730
But power wise I do 15 pounds.
That's it.

1181
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:18,900
Wow.
Yeah,

1182
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,610
it's really a,
it's really weak.

1183
00:47:20,611 --> 00:47:21,780
So when you roll around,
it's,

1184
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,920
it's not fun,
you know,

1185
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:24,330
there's,
of course they attack that arm.

1186
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:25,340
There we go again.
Burgers.

1187
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,590
Well everybody goes into that.
I had um,

1188
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:34,090
J gig up was Sasha was over and his 
brother and his brother said that nobody

1189
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:35,690
could,
they could break his grip,

1190
00:47:35,691 --> 00:47:36,430
had an arm bar.

1191
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,660
I had a really weird way of putting an 
arm bar on,

1192
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,630
but the way I do it,
nobody can escape,

1193
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,940
you know,
and that I control the hand.

1194
00:47:42,941 --> 00:47:45,520
I made sure that the elbow points up,
you know,

1195
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:47,260
and I controlled in such a way that your
arm,

1196
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,990
you can get out,
I can just cover your face,

1197
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,680
the other leg I just can put away and 
you still can't get out.

1198
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,670
Really?
Yeah.

1199
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,040
And he said to me,
oh,

1200
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:56,920
but you can do it with me.
So I'm trying,

1201
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:59,320
trying.
I can brag because apparently he's known

1202
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:01,740
for.
It's very strong and he says ago,

1203
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,820
I say flipper out.
He says,

1204
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:05,110
why?
I said this is my wrong arm.

1205
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:08,950
So I decided to go back and got him in 
the arm or right away.

1206
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:09,670
I said,
listen,

1207
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:11,320
I can't do 15 pounds with this.
You know,

1208
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,820
it's a very weak arm right now.

1209
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,010
So is it eventually going to come back 
to 100 percent?

1210
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:20,070
You know it.
They say it's like a millimeter a day 

1211
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:23,610
and it's two months ago,
so that will be six centimeter go 

1212
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,620
starting from my neck,
let's got to go all the way to here is 

1213
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:26,770
six centimeters of what?
Of Healing?

1214
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,760
Of Healing.
The nerve heals like a millimeter a day.

1215
00:48:29,761 --> 00:48:31,360
They say,
Oh yeah,

1216
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:33,850
so nine months to a year I should 
expect,

1217
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:38,710
at least he said he says his guns back 
because I was very late,

1218
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:42,580
but they misdiagnosed me.
So I walked around with this thing for a

1219
00:48:42,581 --> 00:48:44,590
long time.
So what is the thing though?

1220
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:49,591
What was the actual injury?
So it's the compression of the 

1221
00:48:49,591 --> 00:48:50,980
compression and the pain.
All the pain that I had,

1222
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,290
that was the,
the,

1223
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:55,180
the nerve apparently is all bunch of 
little cables.

1224
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:57,730
He says outside,
there's the pain thing,

1225
00:48:57,731 --> 00:48:59,350
you know,
once you squished and you know,

1226
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:00,910
you're already really far gone.

1227
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,580
And that happened with me.
I had no pain anymore.

1228
00:49:03,581 --> 00:49:04,270
And he says,
man,

1229
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:08,410
that's the worst thing because that 
means that's all already died.

1230
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,480
So you're damaging and you don't even 
feel it.

1231
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:11,590
That's it.
Wow.

1232
00:49:11,591 --> 00:49:15,430
So then they go in there and they drill 
it out and then you have to wait forever

1233
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,780
for it to heal up.
Yeah.

1234
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:22,050
Wow.
And there's nothing you can do in 

1235
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:22,050
between time.
You just have to like let him.

1236
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,430
Nothing.
I started actually yesterday and I think

1237
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:29,920
two days ago I started running on a 
treadmill but only with the incline so I

1238
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:32,400
can run on the balls of my feet so I 
don't have my niche,

1239
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:34,630
shocking and I'm actually feeling okay 
today,

1240
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:35,530
my knees,
so I figured,

1241
00:49:35,531 --> 00:49:40,531
okay,
if I can do that then I can at least 

1242
00:49:40,531 --> 00:49:41,050
start doing my sprints again.
That I used to be a freak man.

1243
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:46,350
I could these these.
What I do is I run 10 miles a 10 

1244
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,110
minutes,
11 miles an hour.

1245
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:52,140
That's the warmup and then I jump off.
I started stretching while I put the 

1246
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,741
incline all the way up,
go to nine miles an hour and then I 

1247
00:49:55,741 --> 00:49:58,711
jumped on for 45 seconds and offer 30 
and I do those 10:10

1248
00:49:58,841 --> 00:50:01,280
of those rounds and after that I run 
like five minutes,

1249
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:02,980
run it out,
Don,

1250
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,560
take a five minute break and then I do 
my power training workout.

1251
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,200
This is what when I was the top of my 
game,

1252
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:13,530
because it's really hard to say you will
do your sprints first and then you were 

1253
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:14,510
doing your powertrain that everybody 
thought I was fear,

1254
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:19,511
but for me,
if you do the parks being first at 

1255
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:22,020
hinder shoe which are running,
sometimes I would do it to mimic the 

1256
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,580
fight because that's what I think is the
biggest problem with a lot of guys.

1257
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,410
They don't realize that you,
you know,

1258
00:50:27,411 --> 00:50:27,990
you're pumping up

1259
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:32,990
and you should do apps.
A lot of apps before you fight and 

1260
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:35,840
stretch them out because what happens is
your abs,

1261
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:40,841
they start filling up elected so that 
behind your apps or your lungs and they 

1262
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:42,200
started.
That's why you see the roid guys because

1263
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:45,170
they have the right away.
They go strong,

1264
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,720
boom,
and then they drop and I think it really

1265
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:49,750
is because of the abs day because if 
you.

1266
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,880
If they do 10 times this,
if it stays like this,

1267
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:55,220
right?
It bobs up while imagine that happens to

1268
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:57,860
your core and with everything while 
you're fighting,

1269
00:50:57,861 --> 00:51:00,080
you're using your core takedown defense,
everything.

1270
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,870
So that's not bloating up,
stops your lung from breathing,

1271
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:04,780
that's why you're here.

1272
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,580
So you think are important for stamina.
That's right.

1273
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:10,510
Very important to keep them loose,
to keep them losing,

1274
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:12,580
to stretch them out.
This is very important.

1275
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,830
I would take before a fight,
also an aspirin,

1276
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:20,340
you know,
to make my blood thin because I in Thai 

1277
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,190
boxing I would never wear reps.
I don't like to have reps around me.

1278
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:25,120
So he'll go bare knuckle into gloves and
went to shoes.

1279
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,500
I hated those things.
You know,

1280
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:28,900
this was totally Japanese rules,
right?

1281
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,120
The shoes.
Yeah.

1282
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,000
Because what happens is those Japanese 
guys,

1283
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:34,090
they're really good on the ground and so
they say okay,

1284
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,090
and the striking not so okay.
So let's put a machine guards,

1285
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:42,100
let's put them on knee protection and 
pushers because the good would lag lux 

1286
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,290
and no gloves because under good for the
rear naked choke and all.

1287
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,570
I mean they're totally adapt.
When I left bankers,

1288
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,140
I think two,
three months later it was,

1289
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,640
they changed the rules so it was close.
I go,

1290
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:55,641
Whoa,
I've been waiting for a long time for 

1291
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:55,641
this.

1292
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:55,641
Yeah,
they had to try to adapt to.

1293
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:57,770
It could be mixed martial arts 
eventually.

1294
00:51:57,771 --> 00:51:59,620
So is it pancreas where you hurt your 
knees?

1295
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,070
I,
you know,

1296
00:52:02,071 --> 00:52:02,790
I don't know.
I,

1297
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,740
I have no clue.
I think I'm so.

1298
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:09,390
I'm very explosive and I think over the 
years that just scraped over my things a

1299
00:52:09,391 --> 00:52:14,391
bolt.
They say that bleeding bone marrow out 

1300
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:14,391
of money.
So it's like,

1301
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:14,520
yeah,
it's like very painful.

1302
00:52:14,521 --> 00:52:15,210
Manage a.

1303
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:20,500
it's so fun.
Do you do any other martial arts 

1304
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,051
exercise?
I know you have that thing that you 

1305
00:52:23,051 --> 00:52:23,600
sell.
Well that's part of it because you don't

1306
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:24,410
want to hit things

1307
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:25,650
right,
exactly like that.

1308
00:52:25,651 --> 00:52:26,970
Yeah,
because it has no impact.

1309
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:28,060
You don't have to get good.
The,

1310
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,770
the tendinitis.
Every fighter should use that thing like

1311
00:52:31,771 --> 00:52:34,830
12 days before the fight.
Not that heavy bag anymore.

1312
00:52:34,831 --> 00:52:36,210
That's where the accidents happen.
You know,

1313
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:38,460
you get tired,
sweat under bag,

1314
00:52:38,461 --> 00:52:40,350
but you gloves to slips,
order it,

1315
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:45,460
wrist hurts.
There's always things happened with a 

1316
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:45,720
heavy bag and they like to hit a heavy 
bag,

1317
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:48,060
which I did also because it's.
It's a cool thing,

1318
00:52:48,061 --> 00:52:50,760
but there's always that moment when you 
hit really hard,

1319
00:52:50,761 --> 00:52:53,760
like liver shop and you feel then I 
know,

1320
00:52:53,761 --> 00:52:55,440
okay,
tomorrow I got the tendonitis,

1321
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:57,250
develop this thing,
this.

1322
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,160
It's called the boss system.
What does it,

1323
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,780
what does it stand for?
The

1324
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,100
body action stand.
So what happened was there's a long time

1325
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:06,180
ago,
a long time ago,

1326
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:11,190
like four years or something ago,
my agent tells me that the woman wants 

1327
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:18,111
to see me,
they have a product and it started out 

1328
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:18,690
with a stent with two of those,
a kicking things.

1329
00:53:18,691 --> 00:53:23,691
She knows that too.
So I came to her and I was hanging up,

1330
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:29,490
hung over to one.
The last period that I was still 

1331
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:29,490
drinking and I walk in,
I say,

1332
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:34,351
okay,
I'm telling you right now because you 

1333
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:34,351
can breathe.
You can smell it.

1334
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:38,150
I'm a little hangover.
Let me take a look at this thing and I 

1335
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:38,150
call you back tomorrow.
What?

1336
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:42,350
I think.
So I looked at the thing and the next 

1337
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:42,350
day I called Becca said,
okay,

1338
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,260
now this is why we should do.
And I had this whole list ready.

1339
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,190
She goes like,
Whoa,

1340
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:44,640
Whoa,
whoa.

1341
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:47,040
We thought you didn't notice anything.
She said No.

1342
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,890
And then I came up to do a body pat,
you know,

1343
00:53:49,891 --> 00:53:52,320
I make targets on there and you know,
but that,

1344
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,020
then it starts because people think this
is an easy product.

1345
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,030
There's knockoffs from distinct,
right?

1346
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,510
They're already selling knockoffs.
If you bite a thing,

1347
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:02,910
then you reel.
That was like our early stages.

1348
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:04,540
What you're going to have,
they're going to flop around,

1349
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:09,541
they're going to break because you need 
to find a spring that is just right to 

1350
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:14,340
not be too floppy and not too stiff.
It's too stiff.

1351
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,920
The whole will move.
If it's too floppy,

1352
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:19,800
you can't knock it for the second punch 
because it's still moving.

1353
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,050
You know,
it needs to be just right now,

1354
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:24,660
the foam in there needs to be just right
now foam,

1355
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,520
the density,
the density.

1356
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,650
If it's really tight form,
it's heavier,

1357
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,770
you know?

1358
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,100
So if you say,
okay,

1359
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:34,450
is this a little bit too hard?
I want different foam,

1360
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:39,500
you put different form,
but now because it's lighter than the 

1361
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,340
spring needs to be changed again.
So every time I got like eight 

1362
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,951
prototypes and I have to train on those 
things the whole time to see and find 

1363
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:49,170
out which is watching what's the best 
way and the best form with what spring?

1364
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,440
It took two and a half years,
two and a half years to find that they 

1365
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,310
hit that thing.
I mean 30,000

1366
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:58,050
times with a machine Dong,
Dong,

1367
00:54:58,051 --> 00:55:01,290
Dong that thing when you buy a windbreak
two guys,

1368
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:06,650
there was two heads broke,
but that was from a shipment that we 

1369
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:09,681
right away to out because it was 
something with the glue that that it 

1370
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:09,681
didn't connect with the.
It was,

1371
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,600
it was vaporizing or eating the glue.
So it didn't work.

1372
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,000
There was to only.
We sent a new handbag and we never.

1373
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:16,760
And we sold a lot of those things have 
no problem.

1374
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,660
No problem.
Do you use those yourself?

1375
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:20,400
Do you use every time when I train?
Yeah,

1376
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:22,410
what I now right now,
I can't.

1377
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:24,510
I use a lot.
I can do hooks like see,

1378
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,970
that's weird,
weird angle for me and apricots.

1379
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:30,810
If I make 10 uppercuts guts the last to 
go slow up because it's.

1380
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,580
Yeah,
it's biceps.

1381
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:36,590
Now you really realize that you need 
your biceps in order to put your body 

1382
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:39,120
weight into a punch.
You can't look it up now.

1383
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,860
A straight punch.
I'm okay with,

1384
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:43,680
but hooks I can eat,
but the globe again hit you as hard as I

1385
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:46,500
wanted your belly.
You're not going to go down real.

1386
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:47,100
Yeah,
it's really,

1387
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,550
it's pathetic when I look at it like I 
need you wild,

1388
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,390
like having no raps on.

1389
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:55,560
I always have that.
I want to have my blood flow.

1390
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,570
Keep going.
For some reason.

1391
00:55:57,571 --> 00:56:02,571
I have the feeling that this happens,
that it doesn't circulate any more 

1392
00:56:02,571 --> 00:56:03,500
naturally so baffling when you got a 
tight wrap on it.

1393
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:04,910
Yeah,
I don't like it.

1394
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,870
You don't need it.
If he had the right way.

1395
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:09,360
All these guys are so like,
like Tyson.

1396
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:14,361
I always give the example,
just know or just learn how to hit the 

1397
00:56:14,361 --> 00:56:14,550
correct way and nothing will happen.
These guys,

1398
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:19,820
they come into a room and they get a 
special guys that they got to stitch 

1399
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,890
their on call every day,
two times a day or at the hands.

1400
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:24,160
He can hit it in any

1401
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,180
angle.
That doesn't matter.

1402
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:29,950
So then when you were this guy,
that's why when you had a street fight,

1403
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,270
he would always break his hand.
Right?

1404
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:34,230
Dyson because you don't know how to hit.
He hits him with a pinky.

1405
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:34,840
Well,
whatever.

1406
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:35,830
Wrong technique.

1407
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:40,070
Just when you're fighting,
because guys move and sometimes you want

1408
00:56:40,071 --> 00:56:45,071
it to hit them with these two knuckles.
Cosby accidentally catch them with the 

1409
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:45,071
last knuckle.
No,

1410
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:45,071
of course

1411
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:48,080
always.
Yeah.

1412
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,640
And especially in karate,
but the cube machine karate years 

1413
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,560
sparring in his bare knuckle and some of
these guys to have a gooey and some guys

1414
00:56:55,561 --> 00:56:56,610
have their hips here.
Right?

1415
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,590
So that's how I broke this one.
Also,

1416
00:56:58,591 --> 00:57:03,591
you hit a hit,
you could think you have to get the 

1417
00:57:03,591 --> 00:57:03,591
liver,
but it's not.

1418
00:57:03,591 --> 00:57:03,591
It's a.
it's a hip bone.

1419
00:57:03,591 --> 00:57:04,530
Yeah.
That hurt.

1420
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:08,490
That was a good thing in mixed martial 
arts because now you can see what you're

1421
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:08,820
hinting at.

1422
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:11,420
Now you started out,
you started out in taekwondo.

1423
00:57:11,421 --> 00:57:12,830
Is that what you.
A taekwondo.

1424
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,660
My forest sport,
yeah.

1425
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,340
I did that for about,
I don't know,

1426
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:22,240
four weeks or six weeks and I was 
already beaten up the brown belts.

1427
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,910
You have to understand my,
my parents are very conservative.

1428
00:57:24,911 --> 00:57:27,540
I never,
they will never allow me to do a martial

1429
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,250
art,
but I always got bullets and I saw Bruce

1430
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:34,560
Lee movie and 76 enter the dragon in,
in um,

1431
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:37,240
in France when we were on a holiday.
And I came out and say,

1432
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,530
that's it.
I want to be Bruce Lee,

1433
00:57:38,531 --> 00:57:40,630
you know,
so make these noon chucks.

1434
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,120
And uh,
I was on my shoes.

1435
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:44,920
I had all.
I was really.

1436
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,720
So,
uh,

1437
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,070
I asked my parents,
please,

1438
00:57:48,071 --> 00:57:48,550
please,
please,

1439
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:49,570
please.
But they wouldn't allow me.

1440
00:57:49,571 --> 00:57:50,830
So I kept going,
kept going,

1441
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,410
trading myself,
watching movies and just kept trying.

1442
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:55,690
And then finally,
after two years they said,

1443
00:57:55,691 --> 00:57:56,440
okay,
you know,

1444
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,270
stop crisis,
go.

1445
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,150
And we had a neighbor,
the girl next door,

1446
00:58:01,151 --> 00:58:03,910
she had a boyfriend who was the cool guy
from the town and he said,

1447
00:58:03,911 --> 00:58:06,070
okay,
come with me kind of under a swing.

1448
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,240
And um,
and I,

1449
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:09,980
I went really good.
I started being up,

1450
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:15,030
like I said,
the brown belts I'll like within six 

1451
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:15,030
weeks,
says,

1452
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:15,030
man,
you got a good feeling.

1453
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:17,590
Show my confidence rose.
And at that moment I was driving,

1454
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,680
riding my bike on the streets and the 
biggest bully comes with six of his 

1455
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,581
buddies or something and they said 
something and I shot at something back 

1456
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:30,220
and it all laugh.
We're laughing at a right away.

1457
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,130
Came after me.
And when I saw them coming from me,

1458
00:58:33,131 --> 00:58:37,360
I stopped my bike and I put it down and 
I was just waiting for the guy.

1459
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,160
And then the biggest bully comes to me 
and he's put,

1460
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:45,190
you know that at the early days.
So you push with your chest and he 

1461
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,120
pushed against my chest and I go puff 
and he goes down,

1462
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,300
broke his nose out.
Anybody more?

1463
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,700
Nobody did anything.
I come home,

1464
00:58:51,701 --> 00:58:56,700
police was already home and that was it.
No more taekwondo for me.

1465
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,780
So when I moved out of the house when I 
was 21,

1466
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,510
you know,
that's when I started fighting.

1467
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,350
That's when you started kickboxing and 
everything.

1468
00:59:03,351 --> 00:59:04,110
Keep boxing.
Yeah.

1469
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:09,210
Boy Tie.
And how did you transition into 

1470
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:09,210
pancreas?
Where did that come about?

1471
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:09,630
You know,
this is a,

1472
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,360
it's cool.
We've got time,

1473
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:12,040
right?
Yeah.

1474
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:12,770
Okay,
cool.

1475
00:59:12,771 --> 00:59:15,830
Now let me go back.
Let me see.

1476
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:20,280
I was fighting a Thai boxing in Holland.
I want a lot of fights by knockout,

1477
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,060
like my first fights have been by 
knockout character 13.

1478
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:26,350
And the first one when I was sick was 
your,

1479
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:31,360
uh,
your final kickboxing record when you 

1480
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,200
were 16,
16 and to now 14 minutes to losses.

1481
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:39,480
So I fought this guy,
um,

1482
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,100
who,
uh,

1483
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:43,730
was in jail for,
looked at Frank Lockman,

1484
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
very powerful fighter.
Had a record like 52 with like three 

1485
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,550
losses of 48.
Not got some monster now.

1486
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:57,551
Apparently I was a bouncer at the time,
apparently on New Year's day when I was 

1487
00:59:57,551 --> 00:59:58,910
bouncing,
I was also drunk.

1488
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:01,320
Oh,
that's an example of.

1489
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:05,570
And somebody asked me if I wanted to 
fight him and I said sure.

1490
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:10,240
So in I think by the end of January I 
get a phone call.

1491
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,110
They asked me where to send the posters 
too.

1492
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,380
And I say,
what poses from the fight?

1493
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,490
I said he's was gonna fight you against 
Lockman.

1494
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,740
And I go,
who said that?

1495
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,200
He said you,
you told me that you got to firefox.

1496
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:23,450
So now they had posters already.
I go like,

1497
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:24,650
okay,
you know,

1498
01:00:24,651 --> 01:00:28,130
I might as well I got to do it now 
because otherwise they're going to think

1499
01:00:28,131 --> 01:00:28,820
I'm scared.
Right.

1500
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:35,110
So I had about five weeks to train.
Now you got understand that I,

1501
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:40,540
I got tired from jumping rope first time
I was so out of shape it was not even 

1502
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:43,040
funny.
So anyway,

1503
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:45,360
I go to the fights and I,
I just had my,

1504
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,960
my knee,
my Shin had this this year.

1505
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,130
There was a huge hole.
I uh,

1506
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,490
I did some crazy stuff on the wall.
There was a wall.

1507
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,190
I jumped on.
I,

1508
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:56,020
I was always really good in jumping up 
like a random and that,

1509
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:57,410
you know,
I could jump this high,

1510
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:00,260
like my chest here,
I would stand in front of it and jump on

1511
01:01:00,261 --> 01:01:05,261
a wall,
but it had been raining and I jumped on 

1512
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:05,261
him.

1513
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:05,750
I slipped up and I landed on my Shin on 
it.

1514
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:11,140
So the rip my Shin Open so they have the
fight was all wild flesh and we had to 

1515
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:11,630
tape,
you know,

1516
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:16,650
and,
and it was like a super glue and 

1517
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:16,650
everything.
And my friend Francis.

1518
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:16,650
Okay.
Lidocaine.

1519
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:17,030
There it is again,
right?

1520
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:19,100
He says you.
I said,

1521
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:20,180
just put it right.
He says no,

1522
01:01:20,181 --> 01:01:22,580
we'll numb up the whole egg in it.
Don't worry about it.

1523
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:24,320
He says,
and he said he put it in my butt.

1524
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:28,970
So he says the leg will be numb and 
you'll see that fight.

1525
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,100
You'll see that fight.
I'm like jumping,

1526
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,890
I've never jumped when I fight and whole
time,

1527
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:34,520
um,
you know,

1528
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:36,500
and I'm shaking my leg and I can't feel 
my leg.

1529
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:38,170
It's like the weirdest thing,
you know?

1530
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,470
No.
So then,

1531
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,000
um,
event,

1532
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:46,040
they said there was a knock.
I wasn't Naca when you look at the 

1533
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,040
fight,
you'll see,

1534
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,190
I don't think he even hits me,
but I am landing on my butt and I want 

1535
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:49,190
to get up and I can't get up.

1536
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:51,020
My leg doesn't work.
And I go,

1537
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,070
Whoa,
you know,

1538
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:52,800
I said,
man,

1539
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:53,870
my leg doesn't work,
you know,

1540
01:01:53,871 --> 01:01:58,871
so.
And the referee stopped the fight and 

1541
01:01:58,871 --> 01:02:00,050
then all the people start saying she,
I always said that he cannot fight.

1542
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,500
So that really bugged me.
Of course.

1543
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,270
Anyway,
I said,

1544
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:06,520
okay,
I'll fight another fight.

1545
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:11,560
Shouldn't have done it either because on
the three days or four days before the 

1546
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:13,400
fight,
I helped a buddy of mine,

1547
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:18,290
they really beat the crap out of him yet
this jaw all the way wired,

1548
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,280
you know,
and his mouth was closed.

1549
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:25,281
So we,
we went to the guys who did it and we 

1550
01:02:25,281 --> 01:02:27,501
got in a little scuffle there of course.
And they threw me in jail for a couple 

1551
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:29,340
of days in the jail.
One is why kick in Canada,

1552
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,390
but it's a long time ago.
End of July,

1553
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:37,230
for some reason I got an infection in 
one of my testicles.

1554
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:40,500
Whoa.
And it became like really big and it was

1555
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:42,600
hurting a lot and they let me out,
you know,

1556
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,750
because it was only a few days.
So once they did the whole test and they

1557
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:46,710
found out that,
you know,

1558
01:02:46,711 --> 01:02:47,970
what the guys did,
they say,

1559
01:02:47,971 --> 01:02:49,020
you know what,
we don't,

1560
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,710
we're not gonna bring it to Guardino 
Day.

1561
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,790
They kind of felt w,
right.

1562
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,500
You know,
doing bobby did.

1563
01:02:56,130 --> 01:03:01,130
Anyway,
I still fought and I shouldn't have 

1564
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:03,231
taken a fight.
I knocked the guy down three times in 

1565
01:03:03,231 --> 01:03:04,410
the first round and then,
and um,

1566
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,940
and actually I,
I,

1567
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:09,390
when I make a spinning back fist,
oh yeah,

1568
01:03:09,391 --> 01:03:14,391
that was it.
He's standing in front of me and I'm so 

1569
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:15,630
tired to know my body is tired and I go 
boom,

1570
01:03:15,631 --> 01:03:16,560
I make good,
better,

1571
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,050
best in his neck.
And he goes down.

1572
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:23,730
And so I think I want to fight.
And apparently like a month before there

1573
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:27,940
was a rule that if you did a bad fist,
you only could do it with a turn.

1574
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:30,150
Some bullshit live.
Yeah.

1575
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:31,920
It was bullshit.
Anyway,

1576
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:35,370
I couldn't come out for the second round
because there was too tired.

1577
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:36,360
And they said,
okay,

1578
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,810
now it really started at Hollins,
you see,

1579
01:03:39,811 --> 01:03:42,320
I always said,
and he used not so good at blah,

1580
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:42,670
blah,
blah.

1581
01:03:42,671 --> 01:03:43,080
I said,
okay,

1582
01:03:43,081 --> 01:03:45,150
I never fight for Holland's anymore.
This is over,

1583
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:45,520
you know,
I,

1584
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,790
if these fans,
I like this,

1585
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:49,560
I don't want to fight in front of people
like this.

1586
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,620
But I was always,
yeah,

1587
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:54,900
it is because you know,
it's your life events.

1588
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:56,460
Um,
and um,

1589
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,490
but it was always that I wanted to do 
something with martial arts.

1590
01:03:59,491 --> 01:04:01,950
So a buddy of mine,
we both together,

1591
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:03,420
we made the show.
It's like an,

1592
01:04:03,421 --> 01:04:08,421
I'm an,
I'm a martial art show on music and we 

1593
01:04:09,091 --> 01:04:12,450
start doing this in nightclubs and we 
would like,

1594
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,910
but really cool,
really cool stuff.

1595
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:17,370
I will kick him into belly like Bruce 
Lee and enter the dragon,

1596
01:04:17,371 --> 01:04:17,550
right?

1597
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:22,550
He would grab my foot,
throw me back and I will make a flying 

1598
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:22,550
in and yeah,
in this phase,

1599
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:24,450
that land and you know,
we did all that cool stuff.

1600
01:04:24,451 --> 01:04:27,230
We,
we will come on with like in a cartwheel

1601
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:30,300
flick flick and uh,
that's the way we would opt to a walk to

1602
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:35,301
the place.
And we had boats and we did noon chucks 

1603
01:04:35,301 --> 01:04:38,130
and we did like breakdowns to crazy 
stuff and little cups on his mouth.

1604
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:43,131
I will kick back,
spinning back in here and jump up and 

1605
01:04:43,131 --> 01:04:43,500
jumping,
flying becky the cup of his head,

1606
01:04:43,501 --> 01:04:46,170
you know,
so good quality martial arts.

1607
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:51,171
But if we start putting comedy in there 
also like funny things that um,

1608
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:53,580
for instance,
I would,

1609
01:04:53,581 --> 01:04:55,380
uh,
I would stand there for a serious with a

1610
01:04:55,640 --> 01:05:00,640
suit and I go get the cups and the guy 
would come back and he had done this 

1611
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,950
little cups and I,
I kept looking straight to go knows the 

1612
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:04,950
other ones,
the other ones.

1613
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:10,230
Okay.
So then he would walk in and he will 

1614
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:10,470
come back with cops like this.
They like stuff like that.

1615
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:12,830
We started doing stuff like that and he 
moved to heaven.

1616
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:17,840
Uh,
there was also a funny one with I will 

1617
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:17,840
do a brake test.
The same thing,

1618
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,381
you know,
we've come into practice and the other 

1619
01:05:21,381 --> 01:05:21,381
ones,
you know,

1620
01:05:21,381 --> 01:05:21,381
so then he came back and he had like 
these,

1621
01:05:21,381 --> 01:05:23,080
these wooden things that were this 
thick,

1622
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:28,110
you know,
and he would spread them out like a day 

1623
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:30,620
I would like pick on read and he would 
hold it and I would stand in front of it

1624
01:05:30,621 --> 01:05:35,040
that I go by because of fear of what he 
will break it,

1625
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:36,560
all of it and stuff like that.
But we'll do it.

1626
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:42,260
And that caught on real fast.
People really started to seem to like 

1627
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:42,970
that.
So suddenly we were doing this on bigger

1628
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,440
shows first in nightclubs.

1629
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,040
Debbie started doing it on shows like,
uh,

1630
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:46,990
events,
big events.

1631
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:52,110
Rob came and when he was fighting,
I think that when he had the main event 

1632
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:53,290
one time we were in the break,
you know,

1633
01:05:53,291 --> 01:05:58,291
showing this to the people.
So that got aired and then we were on 

1634
01:05:58,291 --> 01:06:00,630
Dutch Dev and then your eurosport saw it
and they had an event yearly in,

1635
01:06:00,631 --> 01:06:05,631
in France.
And we went to there and we started 

1636
01:06:05,631 --> 01:06:05,631
traveling now and doing these shows all 
over the place.

1637
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:08,860
And comedy was always the thing,
once we start doing the comedy,

1638
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:09,790
people will know me,
you,

1639
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,830
there's a few of those things on youtube
actually,

1640
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:18,150
so on one of these shows,
because we came up with all these foot 

1641
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:20,530
flux and some salt and all that stuff.
Chris Dolman was sitting there and Chris

1642
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:23,590
Dolman is one of the forefathers in 
Holland was a judo champion.

1643
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:24,940
Tough guy,
you know.

1644
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:27,520
And um,
he called me to him and he says,

1645
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:27,910
man,
you,

1646
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,860
you,
you got some really good abilities,

1647
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:31,750
man.
Did you ever think about free fighting?

1648
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:32,560
You know what it is?
He says,

1649
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:33,460
no.
He said,

1650
01:06:33,461 --> 01:06:34,780
well,
we do that in Japan.

1651
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,880
Are you interested?
I said,

1652
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,410
sure,
because I go,

1653
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,360
okay,
that's not Holland at Chapin,

1654
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:41,710
right.
So he says,

1655
01:06:41,711 --> 01:06:43,810
come and try it out.
So I walk in there and that,

1656
01:06:43,811 --> 01:06:45,160
that moment of us,
you know,

1657
01:06:45,161 --> 01:06:50,161
European champion Thai boxing.
So it was a because the dose to fight 

1658
01:06:50,161 --> 01:06:52,150
for a title.
So I thought I was too cool dude.

1659
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,910
And um,
and that was literally like Royce Gracie

1660
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:55,870
in the beginning,
you know,

1661
01:06:55,871 --> 01:07:00,370
I walk in and they killed me and they 
will put on these jokes,

1662
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:03,580
not blood sugars but like on my windpipe
ido and pulling,

1663
01:07:03,581 --> 01:07:08,581
pulling,
pulling because a lot of those kind of 

1664
01:07:08,581 --> 01:07:08,581
grappling back zero.

1665
01:07:08,581 --> 01:07:09,430
Did you know that they were going to 
Grandpa when you went there?

1666
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:10,470
No.
No,

1667
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,260
nothing,
nothing.

1668
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:12,960
I had no clue.
I saw them on the ground and,

1669
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:13,600
and they said,
okay,

1670
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:14,720
just go.
Wow.

1671
01:07:14,721 --> 01:07:19,721
I hadn't shown up.
You just thought it was just some kind 

1672
01:07:19,721 --> 01:07:19,721
of a crazy fight yet?
No.

1673
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,930
So a training and I literally went,
I drove back,

1674
01:07:22,931 --> 01:07:27,931
I had to stop my car next to the road 
and I had one of the first Phillips for 

1675
01:07:27,931 --> 01:07:32,430
cell phone.
So it was really cool at the doe who 

1676
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:32,620
remember this big mess.
And I called my wife.

1677
01:07:32,621 --> 01:07:33,100
I said,
listen,

1678
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,200
I'm,
I'm in my car next road here.

1679
01:07:35,201 --> 01:07:37,730
I'm going to sleep.
I said I can drive a.

1680
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,130
broke me.
It really,

1681
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:42,040
I,
I had to drink liquids,

1682
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:45,340
food for like three days because my 
throat was messed up because I thought I

1683
01:07:45,341 --> 01:07:46,750
could hold that,
you know,

1684
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:49,210
so I was just fighting it and they were 
pulling,

1685
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:50,400
pulling,
delete.

1686
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,880
I would that,
but it was all crushed up and,

1687
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,830
and my wife was already left.
He,

1688
01:07:54,831 --> 01:07:55,480
she says,
ah,

1689
01:07:55,481 --> 01:07:56,290
okay.
So that's it,

1690
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:57,310
right?
I said,

1691
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:57,700
no,
no,

1692
01:07:57,730 --> 01:07:59,950
I'm going to go back and within six 
months,

1693
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:01,930
36 months,
I'm going to tap everybody there,

1694
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:03,670
you know,
because I want to learn this.

1695
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:06,780
I want to learn this game.
But things started happening and,

1696
01:08:06,781 --> 01:08:11,781
and I got an injury here and injury 
there and I had to work and it was a 

1697
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:11,781
bouncer and,
and you know,

1698
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:15,650
once a month I would go over there and 
it kind of away.

1699
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:19,550
Then my wife looks at me in the 
beginning of her career and she says,

1700
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,070
you're going to be a famous fighter in 
Japan.

1701
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:27,790
And I go,
what would you say that she says that 

1702
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:27,830
just came up with me.
I said,

1703
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,120
no,
I'm not going to fight anymore.

1704
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:29,530
I told you.

1705
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:30,020
She said,
yeah,

1706
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:32,120
you said Holland,
but you're going to go to Japan.

1707
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:37,990
Six months after she made that comment,
I got a phone call and I never pick up 

1708
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:42,131
the phone and uh,
an answering machine was broke or turn 

1709
01:08:42,131 --> 01:08:44,540
off because my crazy ex wife was calling
all the time so I didn't turn on.

1710
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,970
So I get the um,
uh,

1711
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:51,980
uh,
pick up the phone for some reason and 

1712
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:51,980
it's Chris Dolman.
He says,

1713
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:51,980
boss,
you got to come tonight.

1714
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:52,980
You've got to come to them.
Amsterdam,

1715
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,490
there's a tryout is two guys who give 
for Nike to looking for fighter,

1716
01:08:56,491 --> 01:08:58,580
for a new organization.
Bankers.

1717
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
So I went to the tryout.
I had a scuffle with one of the rings 

1718
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,090
champion because they were fighting for 
rings,

1719
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:10,360
but it was a lot of work.
I heard already that they were having 

1720
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:10,360
works,
which works,

1721
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,240
you mean fixed,
fixed fight.

1722
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:14,940
There was a lot of them pancreas right 
now and there wasn't rings in bankers.

1723
01:09:14,941 --> 01:09:16,430
I will go back.
No,

1724
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:18,080
no,
I believe so that there was,

1725
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,510
but not what the people said.
They never asked me.

1726
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:24,050
Well,
I'll come back to that also anyway,

1727
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,700
because he told me right there.
He says,

1728
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:30,701
you know,
it's probably going to ask you a little 

1729
01:09:30,701 --> 01:09:30,701
bit later if you want to lose.
Anyway,

1730
01:09:30,701 --> 01:09:32,390
I started sparring with this guy.
This guy was a rings champion.

1731
01:09:32,391 --> 01:09:34,010
He tried to hurt me because they were 
filming.

1732
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,040
Result was me knocking him out with the 
high cake boom.

1733
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:39,050
And as he,
his whole eyebrow was open.

1734
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:40,580
You had to go to the hospital for 
stages.

1735
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,950
Suzuki a finicky I sort of pointing at 
me.

1736
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:46,760
So they wanted to me,
I think two months,

1737
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:48,590
two and half months later I was in 
Japan.

1738
01:09:48,591 --> 01:09:48,920
And,
and,

1739
01:09:48,921 --> 01:09:53,921
and before I went,
I got that speech from crystal and he 

1740
01:09:53,921 --> 01:09:53,921
said,
they're probably going to ask you,

1741
01:09:53,921 --> 01:09:53,921
you know,
to,

1742
01:09:53,921 --> 01:09:55,910
uh,
to lose or to win a fight a sick because

1743
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:56,960
I don't want to do that.

1744
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:57,980
Is I,
if I wanna,

1745
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:00,440
if I fight,
it needs to be real automized I don't,

1746
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,620
I hated those guys who were there and 
they,

1747
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:05,660
uh,
they would come back and they would say,

1748
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:06,510
um,
yeah,

1749
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,920
became which MPN?
And they were all cool.

1750
01:10:09,921 --> 01:10:11,600
But then when it came back and they have
to lose,

1751
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,400
they will come back and they say,
yeah,

1752
01:10:13,401 --> 01:10:14,580
I lost.
But you know,

1753
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,400
they had to,
I had to lose.

1754
01:10:16,401 --> 01:10:18,890
Yeah,
last time they made you when you know,

1755
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:21,080
but you don't say that,
but you only saved when you lose.

1756
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:22,970
I hated those guys with that.
You know,

1757
01:10:22,971 --> 01:10:27,560
you're not a real guy.
So I knocked a guy out and in the second

1758
01:10:27,561 --> 01:10:30,550
fight I know the other guy out for four 
k.

1759
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,920
and then by the way,
we had dinner with [inaudible] who can 

1760
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:35,920
either go,
Oh God,

1761
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:35,920
here we go,
you know,

1762
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,180
so dinner,
they gave me a book from Fujiwara,

1763
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:41,420
a really good wrestler and a great 
dinner.

1764
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:45,440
And they put me on a cap.
And just before they walked in,

1765
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,360
I go over,
I said,

1766
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,550
I thought you guys were going to ask me.
So he said,

1767
01:10:49,551 --> 01:10:50,240
what do you mean?
He says,

1768
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:52,070
well,
crystal told me that you know,

1769
01:10:52,071 --> 01:10:54,530
that you probably going to ask to,
to,

1770
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,350
to throw the fight.
A Suzuki told me straight in my face,

1771
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,330
I will never ask just a such a thing.
He said,

1772
01:11:00,331 --> 01:11:01,820
we will never do that.
Now.

1773
01:11:01,821 --> 01:11:03,800
Over the years I've been hearing,
of course,

1774
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,870
and some fights.
When you look at fights,

1775
01:11:05,871 --> 01:11:09,440
it looks really smooth and going over 
and like Ken Shamrock,

1776
01:11:09,441 --> 01:11:11,090
sad.
He lost also.

1777
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,880
He lost the last fights.
Role works,

1778
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:15,510
you know,
it's also you go like,

1779
01:11:15,511 --> 01:11:20,511
okay,
he lost twice by exactly the same 

1780
01:11:20,511 --> 01:11:23,361
combination and he'll look into a knee 
bar against the same opponent that you 

1781
01:11:23,361 --> 01:11:25,200
go.
Like if it was a not real,

1782
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:26,720
wouldn't you come up with something 
else?

1783
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,470
It would.
You really do two times the same.

1784
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:30,240
You see,
so that's been also in my head,

1785
01:11:30,241 --> 01:11:32,790
I guess you ever see Bart Vale versus 
Ken Shamrock?

1786
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,620
No,
it looks so fake.

1787
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:37,680
It's one of the early ones that looks 
really like a work.

1788
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:41,340
There's a few that look like a really,
like that's one of them.

1789
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,110
You know,
you've seen the ones in pride,

1790
01:11:43,111 --> 01:11:47,610
like remember when Coleman,
y'all were commentating on that one.

1791
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,930
You would.
Oh my God,

1792
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:51,090
I hated my guts because that was the 
funniest thing ever.

1793
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:55,050
We knew that Coleman was going to lose 
the six minutes with a heel hook.

1794
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:57,780
Right?
New debts was the word I heard that.

1795
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:01,800
So when the reporters came in,
they asked me what do you think is going

1796
01:12:01,801 --> 01:12:03,210
to win?
And I say,

1797
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,300
I say Takata is gonna win in about six 
minutes with the event around.

1798
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:12,960
And they changed it but like faster or 
something,

1799
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:15,470
they didn't really didn't like that,
that I was doing that.

1800
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:18,060
But I go like that.
That's something again,

1801
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:19,500
I can,
that's why I get.

1802
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,810
Sometimes I get emotional from it when 
people say,

1803
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:22,830
oh,
there was a fake.

1804
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:25,140
And then the worst one,
what they say is yeah.

1805
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:27,570
But sometimes there was faking boss 
didn't know of it.

1806
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:31,500
So they told the opponent to lose 
against bus you was like against um,

1807
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,220
I fought against for Nike and then one 
guy said one time he said,

1808
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:35,970
uh,
yeah,

1809
01:12:35,971 --> 01:12:37,560
that was a work because she,
uh,

1810
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,090
didn't uh,
hurt you.

1811
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:44,150
I said,
when did he decide that he was going to 

1812
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:44,430
lose?
Was it before or after he tried to break

1813
01:12:44,431 --> 01:12:45,660
my fricking leg.
I mean,

1814
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,090
I know if you know,
if you see the fight,

1815
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,260
he pushed me a heel hook and inverted.
He'll look with the toes in his neck and

1816
01:12:52,261 --> 01:12:57,261
my heel is 180 degrees there.
I'm literally looking at my own leg and 

1817
01:12:57,261 --> 01:12:57,510
I go,
oh my God,

1818
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:58,130
I don't feel it.

1819
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,540
You know,
that I thought nobody else.

1820
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,760
That was a big risk what he was going to
take.

1821
01:13:02,761 --> 01:13:04,110
If this was a fake fight,
right.

1822
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:09,440
I needed to like two or three times.
So you'll see my leg completely be 

1823
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:09,930
turned the other way.
Did you suffer any damage?

1824
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:10,710
Because.
No,

1825
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:13,020
I have no clue how diverse he'll hook 
is.

1826
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:14,890
One of the worst is the worst one.
I broke this,

1827
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:15,550
this,
um,

1828
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:17,010
I'm walking on the street,
right?

1829
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,330
We should certainly be here with all the
fights.

1830
01:13:19,331 --> 01:13:24,331
We're hybrids wrestling playing Chris we
look at is this giant screen and the 

1831
01:13:24,751 --> 01:13:27,960
first thing you see is me barf giving a 
palm strike and the guy goes down and we

1832
01:13:27,961 --> 01:13:28,780
go,
Yay.

1833
01:13:28,781 --> 01:13:32,700
You enter the Promo for the next day.
So I see this Guy Tucker high,

1834
01:13:32,701 --> 01:13:35,230
she sitting in an,
in a,

1835
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:39,660
in a half guard and he grabs a heel and 
he falls back and I go,

1836
01:13:39,661 --> 01:13:40,170
this is it.

1837
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:41,910
A time I had nobody to roll with,
right.

1838
01:13:41,911 --> 01:13:44,880
I traded on a bag two times a day,
my first year and a half.

1839
01:13:44,881 --> 01:13:48,120
And bankers wasn't be trading on a bag 
pretty much once the wrestling.

1840
01:13:48,121 --> 01:13:48,700
No,
no,

1841
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:51,840
no.
Nothing like Bijou rolling a rock.

1842
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,940
If there was somebody who knew judo,
he would go.

1843
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:59,150
I mean,
I'm talking about once every three 

1844
01:13:59,150 --> 01:13:59,150
weeks.
I'm not kidding.

1845
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:01,110
So next day I'm in deposition and I go 
up.

1846
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:02,450
I might as well try it.
Right?

1847
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,680
So I grabbed that heel,
but since I never did it,

1848
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,200
I didn't realize how much pressure I put
on.

1849
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:10,170
So I grabbed it and I fall back using my
body weight.

1850
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:11,380
I snapped the Shinan APP.

1851
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,380
So first we hear we have,
you know,

1852
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:19,381
so I go,
well you see me letting go and then he 

1853
01:14:19,381 --> 01:14:19,880
feels his knee and he's like,
no,

1854
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,250
if you want to fight it.
So yeah.

1855
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:23,030
But I go like,
oh dude,

1856
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,610
I hurt you.
Nice snap.

1857
01:14:24,611 --> 01:14:29,611
Because we thought it was a knee,
but apparently it was still like a 

1858
01:14:29,611 --> 01:14:31,600
little stuck on that leg.
So then he kicks with Utla and I flex my

1859
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:32,940
muscle.
You see the man,

1860
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:35,380
he puts the foot down a vents all the 
way out.

1861
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:38,360
I've seen that a few times as well.

1862
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:44,040
I've seen a few times with checked legs.
Only in person wants Corey Hill and I'm 

1863
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:44,120
fine.
I forget.

1864
01:14:44,121 --> 01:14:47,110
We fought A.
Brent's no tells his name.

1865
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:48,520
Anyway,
whoever he fought,

1866
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:53,521
he uh,
he checks his kick and Corey hills legs 

1867
01:14:53,521 --> 01:14:54,040
snaps backwards.
Referee didn't even see it.

1868
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,760
So corey goes down,
the referee was in a bang.

1869
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,900
We're all screaming,
stop the fight.

1870
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,450
Referee didn't even know and he's just 
on his back,

1871
01:15:01,451 --> 01:15:02,260
like freaking out.

1872
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:07,330
That's dangerous man.
Especially the Shin when it's 

1873
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:07,330
splintered,
you know,

1874
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:07,330
and it hits a wrong,
uh,

1875
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:10,220
you can pull it out.
You can bleed out that guy or that you,

1876
01:15:10,221 --> 01:15:11,420
you,
you showed me,

1877
01:15:11,421 --> 01:15:14,870
I think on twitter you can tweet with 
the guy who was fighting with the broken

1878
01:15:14,871 --> 01:15:16,120
arm,
whoever.

1879
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,480
I mean,
how tough is that dude?

1880
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:22,630
And he did a feel then the referee solid
in around three and then they stopped 

1881
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:25,811
the fire.
But this guy was just going annihilate 

1882
01:15:25,811 --> 01:15:25,811
Indiana guy with it.
It was a belief the boat.

1883
01:15:25,811 --> 01:15:27,110
These guys were actually really good.
I go,

1884
01:15:27,111 --> 01:15:28,310
what organization was that?

1885
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:33,430
Well,
you know Richard Rich Franklin when he 

1886
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:33,500
fought chocolate was army punched chuck 
with it after it was broken?

1887
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:37,440
Yeah.
So you went in after you.

1888
01:15:37,441 --> 01:15:42,441
If you're finding crew was done,
then you start doing the commentary and 

1889
01:15:42,441 --> 01:15:45,861
uh,
in Japan you had a couple of fights 

1890
01:15:45,861 --> 01:15:45,861
after that.
The,

1891
01:15:45,861 --> 01:15:46,390
the Reuben Villa reality by having the 
WFA and

1892
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:51,790
what,
what EPA was that I would have marker 

1893
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:51,790
and Marco who was,
and Pedro,

1894
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:53,850
he's ill and all these guys,
they were trading with us at the Beverly

1895
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:58,850
Hills Jujitsu club and I would train 
those guys and I would go with them as 

1896
01:15:58,850 --> 01:15:59,850
its corner man and in,
in Japan when you,

1897
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,250
when you fight,
you see the fights are on,

1898
01:16:02,251 --> 01:16:05,550
in the dressing room.
So I'm sitting on watching there and you

1899
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:10,580
Keno and,
and he dakee those two guys to the 

1900
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,960
people from prior to live in America,
you know,

1901
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:13,320
the,
in between persons.

1902
01:16:13,321 --> 01:16:16,170
So to say.
So are there also.

1903
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,940
And I go like,
oh look at that.

1904
01:16:17,941 --> 01:16:20,250
He's going to go for straight armbar 
sounds right.

1905
01:16:20,251 --> 01:16:22,770
Are My charts,
which comes every com boom and the guy's

1906
01:16:22,771 --> 01:16:27,771
got straight arbor,
so they look at me and then the next 

1907
01:16:27,771 --> 01:16:27,980
fight it's right away.
Also again,

1908
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:28,680
I say,
oh my God,

1909
01:16:28,681 --> 01:16:31,010
he's looking for a knee biology's gonna 
roll in libraries.

1910
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:36,090
Just gonna roll.
Going to go for an Ebook as shown a few 

1911
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:36,090
roles.
And it goes for anybody.

1912
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:36,090
They go like,
how do you notice?

1913
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:37,030
I said,
well,

1914
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,810
you can see the setup and they look at 
each other.

1915
01:16:39,811 --> 01:16:44,811
And I said,
did you ever think about being a 

1916
01:16:44,811 --> 01:16:45,060
commentator?
And that's how I got the job.

1917
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,340
Who was doing it before you?
Nobody.

1918
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:49,770
Because they were looking at that moment
they were looking at,

1919
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:54,910
at new people because they had the first
nine or something quarters.

1920
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:58,290
And I,
we did that in a studio a later,

1921
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,190
you know?
Um,

1922
01:16:59,280 --> 01:16:59,940
yeah,
but,

1923
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:00,930
but I,
we,

1924
01:17:00,931 --> 01:17:03,140
I think the first one was um,

1925
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,070
no know Eddie did it with krogers for 
awhile.

1926
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,550
Needed it also.
Yeah.

1927
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:09,980
You came in and did gracie.
She was the

1928
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,750
first one I was there.
That was the first one.

1929
01:17:11,751 --> 01:17:15,230
I think they can broadcast it to the is 
after you've fought in the UFC,

1930
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:16,760
after you'd won the title,
did you,

1931
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:18,500
were you completely dot,
I mean,

1932
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:20,720
you obviously you had another fight in 
the wfm to that,

1933
01:17:20,721 --> 01:17:25,721
like what was it like being there and 
pride during the glory days and you 

1934
01:17:25,721 --> 01:17:25,970
know,
did you think about making comebacks?

1935
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,190
Because I know there was no,
I did.

1936
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,110
I did two times,
two times.

1937
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:36,250
One time it was against.
I'm a federalist silver because they 

1938
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:38,130
needed an appointment for him that was 
at the event at that,

1939
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:43,210
that dynamite of [inaudible] 91 and a 
half thousand people in their life 

1940
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:44,000
outside crazy,
you know,

1941
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:45,470
and I couldn't find an apartment.
And I said,

1942
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:50,530
listen,
I did a role for a long time because I 

1943
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:50,530
had problems.
I said,

1944
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:50,530
but everybody wants to see a strike 
anyway.

1945
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,630
Why an endo was also at the same card 
was k one.

1946
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:56,180
You remember Jeroma Benner was fighting 
blind fright k one rules.

1947
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:01,780
So I said,
so why don't we do k one rules with MMA 

1948
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:01,780
gloves?
I mean,

1949
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:02,810
that's what the people want to see.
Anyway,

1950
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,600
you know from us too,
but that's why I didn't go through.

1951
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:10,630
They took somebody else and yeah,
that would have been awesome it because 

1952
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:11,990
at that time man I,
I was,

1953
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:16,240
I was hurting.
Like I'm my it guy holds the type ads.

1954
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:18,440
I mean we'll have purple arms.
He was going,

1955
01:18:18,441 --> 01:18:19,790
my God,
this is no fun anymore,

1956
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:21,530
you know,
because I was in shape,

1957
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:23,510
you know,
like real good stem fuck.

1958
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:24,870
That would've been a great,
you know,

1959
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:28,910
against Vandelay Holy Shit.
A pure stand up fight.

1960
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:31,220
And then,
and then when,

1961
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:34,850
when Ken came to pride as the first one 
to say,

1962
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:38,830
I say I come out of retirement if you,
if I can find them by Ken said,

1963
01:18:38,831 --> 01:18:43,831
Oh,
we did it already twice where we don't 

1964
01:18:43,831 --> 01:18:43,831
need to do it the third time.

1965
01:18:43,831 --> 01:18:47,620
Really.
So he declined to fight in pride with 

1966
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:47,620
you?
Yeah,

1967
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:47,620
that's what he came personally to tell 
me.

1968
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:47,620
He says,
boss,

1969
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:50,270
I told him that I didn't want to do 
because we were already for two times.

1970
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:53,540
What does I mean?
Gap and you find pancreas.

1971
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:58,541
He never fought a lot,
but but also at that time I was a 

1972
01:18:58,541 --> 01:18:58,780
totally different fighter,
like it can't,

1973
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:02,330
can't fight against me,
made me who I am.

1974
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:06,620
That that fight was like literally God 
was watching and he says,

1975
01:19:06,621 --> 01:19:11,621
okay,
I give you this one guy to train with 

1976
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:12,650
the 19 year old Leon Van Dyke freaking 
monster.

1977
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:16,220
He did on a machine,
but 275 pounds,

1978
01:19:16,221 --> 01:19:18,350
you will do curls.
It was bizarre.

1979
01:19:18,351 --> 01:19:23,351
I would have him in an arm bar and at 
better due to health because you 

1980
01:19:23,351 --> 01:19:26,741
literally would start doing this was 
insanely strong and I started training 

1981
01:19:26,741 --> 01:19:26,741
on both.

1982
01:19:26,741 --> 01:19:28,760
We didn't know anything and we would 
watch tapes,

1983
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,800
I would watch tapes.
I would see a hill who,

1984
01:19:30,801 --> 01:19:32,990
for instance,
I will write down how it works.

1985
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,730
Next day we started rolling.
I will go.

1986
01:19:34,731 --> 01:19:36,110
He'll go.
He'll look and say,

1987
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:37,370
okay,
now let's break this down.

1988
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:39,050
Let's see how we can make it better.
Say,

1989
01:19:39,051 --> 01:19:40,190
okay,
how can you escape?

1990
01:19:40,191 --> 01:19:41,090
Well,
if I push this way.

1991
01:19:41,091 --> 01:19:42,860
Okay,
so can I stop you from doing this?

1992
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,990
And we start breaking down every little 
thing.

1993
01:19:44,991 --> 01:19:45,520
I said,
okay.

1994
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,260
Basically did it by yourself from 
scratch,

1995
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:49,790
everything,
every high level instruction at all.

1996
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:54,820
Nothing.
I did everything myself and and you 

1997
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:57,881
know,
and that's the cool part because one 

1998
01:19:57,881 --> 01:19:59,580
time I got a phone call by my big dvds 
of combat come out and it was at the 

1999
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:03,701
time and Bj fought med use all the way 
back and Bj call me and say,

2000
01:20:05,031 --> 01:20:07,010
hey boss is Bj,
Bj Penn.

2001
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:07,890
I said,
wow.

2002
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:13,370
I say,
what do I owe this pleasure is I just 

2003
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:17,181
want to tell you,
you made the best instruction that I've 

2004
01:20:17,181 --> 01:20:17,181
ever seen as a man.
That is so cool.

2005
01:20:17,181 --> 01:20:17,181
He says,
you gotta go,

2006
01:20:17,181 --> 01:20:18,660
I gotta do my run.
She won't let me,

2007
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:22,710
can I use your quote?
But that's cool stuff.

2008
01:20:22,711 --> 01:20:25,140
And I saw and I realized also that a lot
of people,

2009
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:30,780
a lot of fighters took everything 
straight edge jujitsu and they put it 

2010
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:31,380
into mixed martial arts and a lot of 
stuff.

2011
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:36,381
TwItter,
jujitsu doesn't work in mixed martial 

2012
01:20:36,381 --> 01:20:36,381
arts because it needs to be more 
compact.

2013
01:20:36,381 --> 01:20:40,640
Like a sleeve will will take care that 
it's harder for you to roll out of an 

2014
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,910
arm bar.
So that's why we are bars with me.

2015
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:45,660
I always control the inside of the hand 
so you can rotate your hand,

2016
01:20:45,661 --> 01:20:47,130
whatever are pretty much I do.

2017
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:49,950
It's always control control because they
don't want it to rotate,

2018
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:55,490
you know,
and with helix and we start breaking 

2019
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:55,490
everything down and I say okay,
if I would tap him,

2020
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:57,310
for instance,
with an arm bar from the mountain,

2021
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:59,370
I'm just making something up.
He would,

2022
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:04,430
after three times she wouldn't know my 
setup so I will create a different way 

2023
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:08,570
to go to the down part.
He would find that out and then I will 

2024
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:09,150
create a different way.
so then suddenly I start for every move.

2025
01:21:09,151 --> 01:21:12,420
I started havIng three or four different
ways to go to that submission and ns.

2026
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:14,670
Scott dawson goes around.
That seems so crazy.

2027
01:21:14,671 --> 01:21:18,960
It's like you had to learn jujitsu on 
your own on my own to figure it out.

2028
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,050
Like look at how people are doing it and
deconstruct doing it.

2029
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,290
And then my next eight fights I trained 
for three months,

2030
01:21:25,291 --> 01:21:27,030
I think two times a day.

2031
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:29,720
Sometimes I would wake up at night,
would call him and we will go wrong.

2032
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:34,910
I think I was always game always and we 
were trying and my next eight fights I 

2033
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:37,350
won by submission.
That's ridiculous.

2034
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:40,080
Yeah.
So when did you ever get real legitimate

2035
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:42,620
jujitsu instruction?
Did you get someone who never.

2036
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:45,060
Never in your whole career you're self 
taught?

2037
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,200
Yeah,
everything.

2038
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,430
That's cool.
Wow.

2039
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:52,640
And the cool part and then on our side 
is because I'm very proud of it and 

2040
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,960
that's why I'm saying it as you.
If you look at the record in pancras,

2041
01:21:54,961 --> 01:21:56,100
that rope escapes,
right?

2042
01:21:56,101 --> 01:21:59,260
That means that if you could get an a 
job but you could touch the rope there.

2043
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:00,750
You have to let you go.
It was ridiculous.

2044
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:01,520
But,
but,

2045
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,130
but on the other side,
it's really good for you as a fighter to

2046
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:08,460
develop because now you have to make 
more strategical.

2047
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:13,460
Now you have to make sure that you 
haven't been to center of the ring 

2048
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:13,460
before he goes.
So to then again,

2049
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:14,030
if you're gonna miss it,
you're in the center of the ring.

2050
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:19,130
So there's more thinking with sometimes 
I want to fIght with like for 

2051
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:22,761
submissions.
So instead of going out there I had now 

2052
01:22:22,761 --> 01:22:26,120
for submission victories pretty much in 
one fight and I think that that's why 

2053
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:30,470
the bankers guys were so good in ufc.
I think six or seven guys from pancreas 

2054
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:32,460
became all ufc champion because they 
have that rule.

2055
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:34,200
I truly believe I.
I know it's crazy.

2056
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:39,590
I always said,
as long as I don't get have to escape 

2057
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:40,050
because if I escape for me that would 
feel like a loss,

2058
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:44,100
but I didn't see.
So even allowing them to escape to you.

2059
01:22:44,101 --> 01:22:46,620
It's good because it just means you get 
more submission work in.

2060
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:51,680
I have anoTher fight now we have more 
fights that you feel like you won.

2061
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:54,090
You won already and now let's do it.
Let's do it again.

2062
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:59,300
And then if you look at the waist,
I submitted people you can call a 

2063
01:22:59,300 --> 01:22:59,300
submission.
okay.

2064
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,200
A gogo blood.
I didn't do it,

2065
01:23:00,201 --> 01:23:01,980
but you can come up witH some crazy 
stuff.

2066
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:04,950
I put it every looked normally looked at
verdun knee,

2067
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:06,270
triangle,
triangle

2068
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:11,310
arm or figure force.
How many fights did you have over in 

2069
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:14,110
pancreas?
I'm 31.

2070
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:15,840
Thirty one?
Yeah.

2071
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:18,160
Holy shit.
Over the course of how many years?

2072
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:23,190
That was only because of five years.
I fought the first year of foot nine 

2073
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:24,570
fights in the second nine.
Again aid again.

2074
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,830
I mean that was.
I go.

2075
01:23:26,831 --> 01:23:31,831
I thought that in a pretty short time.
So by the time you got to the ufc you 

2076
01:23:32,081 --> 01:23:35,620
had a shitload of fights.
All the boy thai fights,

2077
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:40,621
all the pancreas fights and then finally
you got to fight mma style finally 

2078
01:23:40,621 --> 01:23:42,610
because I,
I wanted to go.

2079
01:23:42,611 --> 01:23:46,500
Did you see for the,
for the entrance song?

2080
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:50,230
I kid you not.
I thought that was the coolest Thing.

2081
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:58,840
I don't get to get to them.
Get together and do from Idaho over 

2082
01:24:01,790 --> 01:24:02,660
holland,
you know,

2083
01:24:02,661 --> 01:24:05,980
and I have to come up with that song.
That is so cool.

2084
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,490
And that really,
that's the.

2085
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:08,710
They came asked me,
I said,

2086
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:11,680
but that was the deciding factor that I 
said,

2087
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:12,520
okay,
I want to do with.

2088
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:14,740
BecauSe they just loved that stuff and 
then

2089
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:17,280
they promoted the shit out of you when 
you first came on.

2090
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:19,210
I remember that I gave you one of the 
posters,

2091
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:24,470
brian sold that on ebay.
I used to have the old closes the 

2092
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:24,470
world's best martial artist,

2093
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,350
but it was cool and,
and,

2094
01:24:26,351 --> 01:24:27,610
and I had a great idea.
I had,

2095
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:31,890
I had that the three to norse and know 
pavarotti and all these guys,

2096
01:24:31,891 --> 01:24:32,700
they had this,
uh,

2097
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:33,410
they didn't,
uh,

2098
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:38,420
tour and on one of those strikes is I 
like to be in America and it's a 43 

2099
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:40,440
second clip and I told him,
I said,

2100
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:41,820
oh,
I looked at rick.

2101
01:24:41,850 --> 01:24:42,840
I know,
and I thought,

2102
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:48,080
okay,
please let me put on that clip for 43 

2103
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:48,300
seconds and then the u of c tune comes 
up.

2104
01:24:48,301 --> 01:24:50,640
I mean,
I'm going to score here in America.

2105
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:56,180
Literacy.
We're so worried about your opening 

2106
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:56,180
music.
Oh man.

2107
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:56,400
That was it for every fighter.
I always got that.

2108
01:24:56,401 --> 01:24:57,130
That's why.
Did you need

2109
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:59,280
read the script already for kevin's 
movie?

2110
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:00,030
No,
I haven't read it.

2111
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,020
Okay.
Because you're in it,

2112
01:25:01,021 --> 01:25:01,440
right?
Yeah.

2113
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,550
Yeah.
So,

2114
01:25:02,551 --> 01:25:03,660
uh,
it's really fun.

2115
01:25:03,661 --> 01:25:04,560
James,
for you didn't know,

2116
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:06,030
was trained with you a bunch of times,
right?

2117
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:06,380
Yeah,
yeah,

2118
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:07,110
yeah.
He did.

2119
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,360
The very talented martial artist,
he really is.

2120
01:25:09,361 --> 01:25:12,090
People gonna know the people who are 
talking a lot of shit.

2121
01:25:12,091 --> 01:25:17,091
Like Kevin James,
a comedian that's going to do a ufc 

2122
01:25:17,091 --> 01:25:17,520
movie.
Kevin james can hit the fucking shit out

2123
01:25:17,521 --> 01:25:19,560
of the path.
I see whites.

2124
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:24,770
You're going to freak.
When I was in boston when I was doing 

2125
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:24,770
that,
a zookeeper movie with them.

2126
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:24,770
We trained with mark telegraaf.
Jay.

2127
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:27,660
I'm just like,
god damn dude is fucking technique.

2128
01:25:27,661 --> 01:25:29,670
It's chris and and you know what?
If you.

2129
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:30,990
If you.
If I say,

2130
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:36,050
okay,
you need to open you up a little bit 

2131
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:36,050
more done.
He'll do it the next time.

2132
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:36,050
Very smart too.
Yeah,

2133
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:36,560
he is.
He really is.

2134
01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:38,850
He hates it when we say this because she
said,

2135
01:25:38,851 --> 01:25:40,900
oh,
I've just.

2136
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:41,910
He's a very,
very,

2137
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:44,190
very humble guy.
He is for her successor,

2138
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,110
successful guys.

2139
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:50,960
I met him when he lived in that 
apartment on overland in a one bedroom 

2140
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,670
apartment,
which he shared with another guy and now

2141
01:25:53,671 --> 01:25:56,160
he lives in the house yet you know where
he lives and then you go.

2142
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:57,870
He's the same dude.
Same guy.

2143
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,340
Same guy.
Kevin,

2144
01:25:59,341 --> 01:26:00,980
since who was basically an open 
microphone,

2145
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:04,160
I just want to talk to,
is my manager in to signing him.

2146
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:04,740
Oh,
well,

2147
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,320
you've only been doing comedy just like 
me.

2148
01:26:06,321 --> 01:26:11,321
We were both basically open microphone.
We'd done a little bit of professional 

2149
01:26:11,321 --> 01:26:14,381
work,
but I mean we've been doing comedy to 

2150
01:26:14,381 --> 01:26:16,391
three years.
You're really an open mic or that's 

2151
01:26:16,391 --> 01:26:16,391
getting paid.
You're an amateur,

2152
01:26:16,391 --> 01:26:16,391
right?
Basically,

2153
01:26:16,391 --> 01:26:17,540
that's when kevin and I met.
We met.

2154
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:18,650
I'm like,
shit,

2155
01:26:18,651 --> 01:26:20,780
91 maybe [inaudible] 92.
Yeah.

2156
01:26:20,781 --> 01:26:25,010
You said that you and he would watch the
pancreas fights all that together.

2157
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:25,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

2158
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:27,570
That used to come over my house in 
encino.

2159
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:28,480
We would watch them.
Man.

2160
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:32,030
I had a buddy of mine from Canada who 
would get them from Japan.

2161
01:26:32,031 --> 01:26:32,390
Yeah.
Uh,

2162
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,000
a connection in Japan.
So he would get them,

2163
01:26:35,001 --> 01:26:38,960
they would send them to Canada and then 
he would send them from Canada to me and

2164
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:42,470
then we would watch them at my house.
Got all japanese commentary,

2165
01:26:42,471 --> 01:26:43,550
you know,
I watched all of them.

2166
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:44,210
I've watched,
you know,

2167
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:49,220
I get a stack of them every month.
This was before I was even working for 

2168
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:49,220
the ufc.
I,

2169
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:49,220
there's,
uh,

2170
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:54,120
you know,
before I ever even started thinking 

2171
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:54,120
about doing commentary.
Yeah.

2172
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:54,470
Yeah.
We were just fans.

2173
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:59,600
How did you ever get in debt because you
went from fear factor before that?

2174
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:02,450
I started working in [inaudible] 97 
before you came to the ufc.

2175
01:27:02,451 --> 01:27:05,030
I'd done,
I'd done the post fight interviews.

2176
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:06,410
Oh,
about two years.

2177
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:09,020
I started at ufc 12.
Dothan,

2178
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:11,440
Alabama vito belfort debut.
Okay.

2179
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:14,150
And uh,
I did it then I was on news radio.

2180
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:17,120
And what happened was they just needed a
guy to do the post fight interviews.

2181
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:20,640
They didn't have anybody and my manager 
was friends with the guy who,

2182
01:27:20,670 --> 01:27:22,130
the same guy who signed kevin,
I was,

2183
01:27:22,131 --> 01:27:24,940
my manager was friends with the guy who 
is one of the producers of the show,

2184
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,070
Scott Campbell mclaren,
who was also the guy who tried to get me

2185
01:27:28,071 --> 01:27:29,300
to fight wesley snipes one day.

2186
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,250
And so they,
um,

2187
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:36,520
they needed someone to do the post fIght
interviews and so he just sent me to 

2188
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,270
fucking Alabama out of nowhere.
and before,

2189
01:27:38,271 --> 01:27:43,271
you know,
and I'm doing it was very unorganized 

2190
01:27:43,271 --> 01:27:43,271
though.
It's not like the ufc today.

2191
01:27:43,271 --> 01:27:45,590
I did it for maybe two years,
but I saw a lot of great fights,

2192
01:27:45,591 --> 01:27:47,240
you know,
shamrock versus enovia.

2193
01:27:47,241 --> 01:27:50,270
If I saw frank,
a radical tours debut,

2194
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:53,240
vito belfort debut,
dan henderson's debut,

2195
01:27:53,241 --> 01:27:55,370
I mean it was there for a lot of great,
great fights,

2196
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,830
but it started to cost me money so I 
quit.

2197
01:27:57,890 --> 01:28:00,530
It was like I would make more money 
doing comedy than that.

2198
01:28:00,531 --> 01:28:03,500
So it was a little too.
And it was on news radio at the time,

2199
01:28:03,501 --> 01:28:04,290
the sitcoms.
So I was,

2200
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:07,610
I was too busy so I quit.
And then when the ufc came along,

2201
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:11,150
when zuiker rather purchase the ufc,
then I started working for them.

2202
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:13,820
That was.
When did you fear fear factor?

2203
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:15,270
That was at that time also?
Yeah,

2204
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:20,410
to fear factor was 2001 I believe it 
started and I was already on fear factor

2205
01:28:20,871 --> 01:28:23,840
when I started working for the ufc.
They did it as a favor.

2206
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:26,270
The first I think eight shows I did for 
free.

2207
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:27,740
I just said,
you know,

2208
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:30,340
they wanted me to do commentary and it's
like,

2209
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:31,250
all right,
I'll do it.

2210
01:28:31,251 --> 01:28:33,590
I'll sit in there.
I'll just was just talking,

2211
01:28:33,591 --> 01:28:34,420
you know,
I really,

2212
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:35,990
honestly,
I shouldn't have been paid for the first

2213
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:36,740
one,
so it wasn't very good.

2214
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:38,270
But still,
you know,

2215
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:41,180
that's the same as fighting.
You don't care about money,

2216
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:42,290
better andale,
you know,

2217
01:28:42,291 --> 01:28:43,310
something you go like,
okay,

2218
01:28:43,311 --> 01:28:45,530
well actually she was get paid for it,
but then it became,

2219
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:47,840
you know,
became the thing that I enjoyed most.

2220
01:28:47,841 --> 01:28:49,790
I mean there's like standup comedy.
I enjoy the most.

2221
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:52,310
I'm always be a fan of mixed martial 
arts.

2222
01:28:52,311 --> 01:28:57,311
Even when I'm not doing.
If I retire one day and stopped doing 

2223
01:28:57,311 --> 01:28:59,861
commentary,
I'm always going to watch the fight was 

2224
01:28:59,861 --> 01:29:01,790
going to be a fan,
but I'm always going to do stand up 

2225
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:01,790
comedy as a profession.
So that's my number one.

2226
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:03,930
But other than that,
all the things that I've ever done in my

2227
01:29:03,931 --> 01:29:08,931
life like you have or a fear factor or 
news radio or the ufc is the greatest 

2228
01:29:08,931 --> 01:29:09,500
fucking job ever.
I mean,

2229
01:29:09,501 --> 01:29:09,870
I love it.

2230
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,120
It's I,
I always love those show in Japan.

2231
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:13,390
I,
I will say tomorrow,

2232
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:18,480
jay morrow,
we're the only two in 6 billion right 

2233
01:29:19,431 --> 01:29:24,431
now who see freaking fade or versus cro,
cop fader and nogueira,

2234
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:28,500
apic fights and,
and,

2235
01:29:28,501 --> 01:29:31,160
and vandelay silva violating,
you know,

2236
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:35,220
a crazy stuff and they

2237
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:38,920
for some prime pride for people that 
don't know,

2238
01:29:38,921 --> 01:29:43,921
we're aware of pride,
pride in needle in the hay day was one 

2239
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:47,401
of the best,
if not the best organization in the 

2240
01:29:47,401 --> 01:29:47,401
world because they had so many different
rules.

2241
01:29:47,401 --> 01:29:48,610
First of all,
there are a lot of things that I like.

2242
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,650
They had 10 minutes for the first round.
Yeah.

2243
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:52,240
I liked that because then,
you know,

2244
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:57,250
a lot of times the guy would take a guy 
down with five minutes into the fight 

2245
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:57,250
and then the round would end,
you know,

2246
01:29:57,250 --> 01:30:00,010
and he was Just starting to get imposed 
his part of the game.

2247
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:02,110
But in the,
in the pride rules,

2248
01:30:02,111 --> 01:30:07,111
they would give them a full 10 minute 
first round and they allow soccer kicks 

2249
01:30:07,111 --> 01:30:10,591
and stomps.
I mean it was a lot more plays and no 

2250
01:30:10,591 --> 01:30:10,591
elbows on the ground.
No elbow.

2251
01:30:10,591 --> 01:30:10,591
He had less cuts.

2252
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:12,290
That's uh,
that's what I always say.

2253
01:30:12,291 --> 01:30:17,120
I want to have the malone nice under 
ground and get away from the guts.

2254
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:19,490
We know how many nuggets that you see 
with an elbow.

2255
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:22,700
Right?
Five if that ever.

2256
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:23,940
Well,
it's a good weapon.

2257
01:30:23,941 --> 01:30:24,270
I mean,
look,

2258
01:30:24,271 --> 01:30:26,130
jon jones,
when you use it on brandon vera,

2259
01:30:26,131 --> 01:30:26,790
I mean he broke his.

2260
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:27,660
Oh yeah,
no,

2261
01:30:27,661 --> 01:30:32,000
but that was then one of the five name 
miata for my money.

2262
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:33,540
Yeah.
But yeah,

2263
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:38,720
but a lot of fights get stopped by cuts 
and a lot of guys and I hate that 

2264
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:38,720
because of the,
on the street.

2265
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,650
you wouldn't stop if you get a gut,
you keep fighting,

2266
01:30:40,651 --> 01:30:45,651
you know,
it's another real when I'm going to 

2267
01:30:45,651 --> 01:30:45,651
discard guys who make careers out of it,
you know,

2268
01:30:45,651 --> 01:30:49,490
but still effective weapon.
I feel like you can't take it away 

2269
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:49,650
either because it's so.
It's so good.

2270
01:30:49,651 --> 01:30:51,010
It's a good technique.
And they.

2271
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:53,470
Okay.
Maybe what they should do is if you have

2272
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:54,670
it again,
the elbow pad.

2273
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:59,780
Yes.
So something around it that at least it 

2274
01:30:59,780 --> 01:30:59,780
doesn't cut.
I'm totally for it.

2275
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:00,150
If you knock them out,
man,

2276
01:31:00,151 --> 01:31:05,151
I'm the biggest guy,
but not like laying on somebody and 

2277
01:31:05,151 --> 01:31:06,450
literally do this.
They don't even load them up,

2278
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:09,450
just rub and rub and rub and then they 
get gutted and they.

2279
01:31:09,451 --> 01:31:10,110
When a fighter.
Yeah.

2280
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,040
I want to find.
No,

2281
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:13,160
you didn't a fight for me.
It didn't mean that fight.

2282
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:16,580
Do you think they could solve that with 
a neoprene sleeve on the elbow?

2283
01:31:16,581 --> 01:31:17,040
Maybe with

2284
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:18,040
problem is,
you know,

2285
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:20,950
is like this crazy time.
We tie things that ever and you know,

2286
01:31:20,951 --> 01:31:23,980
that always starts moving in.
Iran is going to be annoying.

2287
01:31:23,981 --> 01:31:27,190
People get paid to be shit.
Maybe surgically

2288
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:32,570
they have implant one surgically implant
a pad over your elbow,

2289
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:35,070
man in saudi or not.
It's you.

2290
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:38,060
You're all fired up.
So you've,

2291
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:43,460
you did two fights in the ufc after you 
won the title with random and what made 

2292
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:43,460
you,
what made you stop

2293
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:44,880
pain?
Pain.

2294
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:49,890
So assuming that that neck injury,
I brought it all the way to the random 

2295
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:51,650
and fight it.
It was still not gone.

2296
01:31:51,710 --> 01:31:53,690
I was hurting.
I couldn't sleep.

2297
01:31:53,691 --> 01:31:57,500
I wasn't sleeping pills for such a long 
time because of the pain.

2298
01:31:57,501 --> 01:32:00,070
There was always pain pain in my neck 
and

2299
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,940
then I said,
you know what,

2300
01:32:00,941 --> 01:32:03,250
I'm going to start with biceps,
like throwing the left.

2301
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:04,650
Who could the air park?
I go,

2302
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:05,680
what?
Oh my god,

2303
01:32:05,681 --> 01:32:06,490
what's going on now?
You know,

2304
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:07,930
I stopped breaking down,
breaking down,

2305
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:11,140
and then I started.
I didn't do anything.

2306
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:16,560
Then I started draining like three years
after that I started trading and it,

2307
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:18,400
and it went,
started going good,

2308
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:20,470
and the ground started going good and 
you know,

2309
01:32:20,471 --> 01:32:22,000
okay,
everything feels good.

2310
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:26,350
And then I stopped and then like two 
years later,

2311
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,360
two and a half years later,
they,

2312
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,430
they,
that's when they call me for the wfa,

2313
01:32:30,431 --> 01:32:34,370
if I was interested,
they offered me a lot of money and uh,

2314
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:37,390
and apparently what happened,
it was funny also because they,

2315
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,940
kimberly apolo to him,
they said,

2316
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,320
he says,
who do you want to fight?

2317
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,350
And I said,
hickson hixson.

2318
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,090
They said,
we don't have the money for that.

2319
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:47,650
There's never going to happen.
I said,

2320
01:32:47,651 --> 01:32:49,720
okay then.
Sounds crazy.

2321
01:32:49,721 --> 01:32:50,900
Right?
He wants millions.

2322
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:52,330
Yeah.
That was at the time,

2323
01:32:52,331 --> 01:32:57,331
you know,
and I was just wanting to see what you 

2324
01:32:57,331 --> 01:32:57,331
can do against the right.
And um,

2325
01:32:57,331 --> 01:32:57,850
so they,
um,

2326
01:32:58,420 --> 01:32:59,740
by the way,
that would have been another awesome.

2327
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:04,980
That would've been awesome.
Fight you against mandalay or you go 

2328
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:06,520
gone.
that's a shame.

2329
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:08,800
Anyway.
Then I said,

2330
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:10,360
uh,
I don't know if you know,

2331
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:12,850
I don't.
No,

2332
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:13,210
no,
no.

2333
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,760
They said positive for steroids.
Yeah.

2334
01:33:15,761 --> 01:33:17,380
But what,
when did he said kimberly polish,

2335
01:33:17,381 --> 01:33:18,160
are you sure?
I said,

2336
01:33:18,161 --> 01:33:23,161
man,
I just hang out with them in Japan when 

2337
01:33:23,161 --> 01:33:23,161
he fought in Japan.
It's kind of weird if I know he actually

2338
01:33:23,161 --> 01:33:23,161
wants to find you.
I said,

2339
01:33:23,161 --> 01:33:25,090
oh cool.
So Then when we had the photo shoot,

2340
01:33:25,091 --> 01:33:28,390
I go to the photo shoot and he's there 
and he's acting all weird like giving me

2341
01:33:28,391 --> 01:33:31,290
him,
but like shying away and I go like a,

2342
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:33,640
he's taking his five very serious,
right?

2343
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:34,450
I mean,
what's going on?

2344
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:39,480
Oh yeah.
We told him that you specifically asked 

2345
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,521
for him and then I thought,
you know,

2346
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:43,930
what am I going to tell him?
But then I thought,

2347
01:33:43,931 --> 01:33:48,931
no,
I'm not going to tell him because if I 

2348
01:33:48,931 --> 01:33:48,931
tell him,
um,

2349
01:33:48,931 --> 01:33:52,070
you know,
that maybe he's not going to train as 

2350
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:52,070
hard.
I wanted to have a tough fight,

2351
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:52,070
you know,
so I thought he's angry,

2352
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:53,950
he's going to train harder,
is going to be awesome,

2353
01:33:53,951 --> 01:33:57,310
fight.
And then I thought that that was my,

2354
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:02,340
my crazy mind.
I say on the day of the fight I would 

2355
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:05,551
deliver a letter to him into the 
dressing room saying exactly what I Just

2356
01:34:05,651 --> 01:34:07,810
said.
So he would read like,

2357
01:34:07,811 --> 01:34:12,811
I knew this already,
but I didn't want to tell you because I 

2358
01:34:12,811 --> 01:34:13,200
want you to be 100 percent before you 
fight me and,

2359
01:34:13,201 --> 01:34:16,480
and full of stamina because you've got a
needed and that way I think that will be

2360
01:34:16,481 --> 01:34:19,240
totally backfiring right away just 
before your fight.

2361
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:21,550
so that was the setup to,
to play.

2362
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:23,500
And then yeah,
he got tested positive.

2363
01:34:23,501 --> 01:34:27,040
So that was rubin had to take his place,
took a lot of guys,

2364
01:34:27,041 --> 01:34:29,170
don't gabba didn't want to do it.
And then there's a lot of,

2365
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:32,020
bunch of guys they went over because I 
said anybody they gave,

2366
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:34,350
they came up with that because I didn't 
talk.

2367
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,610
it was just the only one who was willing
to take the fine.

2368
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:36,960
Yup.

2369
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:40,290
Now when you were over there in Japan 
and you were,

2370
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:45,300
were there for all those great finds 
like nogueira versus a nogueira versus 

2371
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:49,740
cro cop and nogueira versus fade or,
and what was that like sitting there?

2372
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:50,350
Ringside.
I mean,

2373
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,150
did you want to just fucking jump in 
there?

2374
01:34:52,151 --> 01:34:53,050
Sometimes it's

2375
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,620
crazy.
You get crazy.

2376
01:34:54,621 --> 01:34:57,380
You get you.
You were over there for some of greatest

2377
01:34:57,381 --> 01:34:58,490
fights ever,
ever,

2378
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:03,850
ever.
And nobody gets to take that away from 

2379
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:03,850
you.
That's what they said.

2380
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:03,860
But my fights also,
I want to fight the fights are beggars.

2381
01:35:03,861 --> 01:35:05,360
And one guy in hollywood says,
he says bus.

2382
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:06,500
Everybody was saying,
oh,

2383
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:07,340
he's going to lose.
You're gonna lose.

2384
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:07,990
You're gonna lose,
you know,

2385
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:11,240
like very negative public country.
And one guy says,

2386
01:35:11,241 --> 01:35:12,290
bus,
whatever happens,

2387
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:14,030
they never take this away from you 
anymore.

2388
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:15,670
So look those up.
They got,

2389
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:16,700
you got this,
you know.

2390
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:19,060
And uh,
and that's what were those fights also?

2391
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:24,070
That's something that you carry on,
but the rest of your life they were 

2392
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:24,070
great moments and to interview those 
guys,

2393
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:26,120
you know,
to reenact with them and do crazy stuff.

2394
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:28,790
And then when I started doing these 
crazy opening,

2395
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:30,410
she noticed those were fun,
man.

2396
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:35,230
I like those who didn't like those that 
jerry mellon came.

2397
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:35,980
Oh,
that guy.

2398
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:36,760
Yeah.
You know,

2399
01:35:36,810 --> 01:35:39,740
he was suddenly everything needs to be 
the same as boxing.

2400
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:44,980
And I go,
why are we going to be the same as 

2401
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:44,980
everybody else?
You know,

2402
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:44,980
let it,
let it,

2403
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:45,370
let it be like.

2404
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:46,920
Yeah.
How many fights did you do over there?

2405
01:35:46,921 --> 01:35:48,750
And pride.
How many cards?

2406
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:50,070
Oh god,
I don't know.

2407
01:35:50,071 --> 01:35:52,110
I mean,
but when they started bushido also,

2408
01:35:52,111 --> 01:35:54,030
I was there 12 times a month,
a year,

2409
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,620
a few month.
I was like five,

2410
01:35:55,621 --> 01:35:56,270
$6.
I've,

2411
01:35:56,430 --> 01:35:57,450
yeah,
I have no clue.

2412
01:35:57,490 --> 01:36:00,750
but during the day,
it must have been completely insane.

2413
01:36:00,751 --> 01:36:05,751
I mean,
I heard stories about guys getting paid 

2414
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:05,751
with stacks of money,

2415
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:05,751
stacks of money.
It was crazy old chris.

2416
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:07,830
Bold numbers.
Exactly in a row.

2417
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:11,930
I mean if they,
if they would walk in there with guns,

2418
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:12,890
but yeah,
that again,

2419
01:36:13,330 --> 01:36:16,380
don't want to do that.
I guess there's a lot of money there.

2420
01:36:16,410 --> 01:36:19,140
To pan is run by the yakuza.
Right.

2421
01:36:19,141 --> 01:36:22,560
That's the whole deal with pride and all
these organizations that basically.

2422
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:25,010
And that's accepted,
that's a part of japanese culture.

2423
01:36:25,011 --> 01:36:26,190
Right.
And is that just how it works?

2424
01:36:26,191 --> 01:36:26,480
No,
no,

2425
01:36:26,481 --> 01:36:26,680
no,
no,

2426
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:27,000
no,
no.

2427
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:32,060
It's uh,
it's not accepted because went when it 

2428
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:32,060
came out

2429
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:34,650
then it was over,
right then regards to the tv set.

2430
01:36:34,810 --> 01:36:37,780
We don't want to be associated with it.
And they pulled the money out.

2431
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:41,240
Was that just because it was made public
but it was already known,

2432
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:43,040
but I think it was made public.
I fit this,

2433
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:47,180
forget this.
It was a pass from joe rogan for a buddy

2434
01:36:47,181 --> 01:36:49,790
of mine.
I gave him a ufc password.

2435
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:51,350
That's cooL.
is that your phone?

2436
01:36:51,351 --> 01:36:54,270
That keeps going on and has no clue.
Oh,

2437
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,470
my battery is too low for you.
Okay.

2438
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:00,950
Go have turned out.
So when you were over there though,

2439
01:37:00,951 --> 01:37:03,680
when you were watching all these classic
fights and then like I said,

2440
01:37:03,681 --> 01:37:06,800
you'd been there for.
I mean you were there for shogun,

2441
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:11,801
Mark Coleman,
you were there for show gun versus 

2442
01:37:11,801 --> 01:37:11,810
rampage.
Rampage versus a rona.

2443
01:37:11,811 --> 01:37:15,200
I mean some of the greatest fights of 
all time,

2444
01:37:15,201 --> 01:37:16,110
right.
Rampage.

2445
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:18,500
The things that be dead with rampage.
How,

2446
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:23,740
you know.
I remember my first when he fought 

2447
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:25,190
sakuraba and he lost that fight.
I took him to the side.

2448
01:37:25,191 --> 01:37:26,030
I say,
listen,

2449
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,880
you got it man.
You got this thing,

2450
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:30,380
they love you.
I say,

2451
01:37:30,381 --> 01:37:33,320
make sure this doesn't happen anymore.
Because they actually had to get him out

2452
01:37:33,321 --> 01:37:38,321
of jail to get that fight.
That was a whole stress thing going on 

2453
01:37:38,321 --> 01:37:38,840
because he,
he had a,

2454
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:44,100
he had a warrant out of him or something
and he was at the airport and they got 

2455
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:44,570
them and they put them in jail.
Real.

2456
01:37:44,571 --> 01:37:46,160
Yeah.
But the deprived people started talking.

2457
01:37:46,161 --> 01:37:48,050
They got them out.
They made pictures of it.

2458
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:52,330
He standing in front of the jail was 
undercover of the newspapers.

2459
01:37:52,370 --> 01:37:54,290
Was he standing there with his big 
chain?

2460
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,470
You know,
and uh,

2461
01:37:55,471 --> 01:37:56,190
that was

2462
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:58,710
that script and he came in.
Now the prime,

2463
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:03,770
what was going on back then at that time
was pride was a mainstream japanese 

2464
01:38:04,471 --> 01:38:08,040
sensation.
It was huge in mainstream Japan,

2465
01:38:08,041 --> 01:38:09,810
right.
It wasn't like mma,

2466
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:14,910
mixed martial arts in America back then 
was not nearly as successful as it is 

2467
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:17,400
today.
A small show was 43,000

2468
01:38:17,401 --> 01:38:19,550
people.
Damn.

2469
01:38:19,930 --> 01:38:24,090
And they would sell out all the time,
but it could show 91 and a half.

2470
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:25,560
Tokyo dome,
55,

2471
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:27,990
60,000.
I mean it was crazy.

2472
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:29,850
And you would go out on the street and 
you were getting mom.

2473
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,830
There was no everybody.
Yep.

2474
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,740
So what happened?
What happened over there?

2475
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,590
Because it stopped being like that.
It stopped being like,

2476
01:38:37,591 --> 01:38:38,880
because of that I,
I.

2477
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:40,080
Because the accuser.
Yeah.

2478
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:40,830
When,
when,

2479
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,340
when the tv pulled everything out,
it was over.

2480
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:46,390
That's when everything went down to 
dread.

2481
01:38:46,391 --> 01:38:47,670
It was so successful.

2482
01:38:47,670 --> 01:38:52,670
So many people liked it.
I couldn't imagine that someone else 

2483
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:52,670
wouldn't come along.
No,

2484
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:52,670
no,
no,

2485
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:52,670
no,
no,

2486
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:56,510
no.
I think the main reason of this 

2487
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:59,660
sakharova started to lose you like an 
organization in Japan in order to be 

2488
01:39:00,331 --> 01:39:03,610
successful.
they need japanese star star and,

2489
01:39:03,611 --> 01:39:06,970
and where are you going to fight?
Good luck to find another sec.

2490
01:39:06,971 --> 01:39:11,220
Robert who beat for grace.
She's not unbelievable fighter,

2491
01:39:11,370 --> 01:39:16,370
you know,
but it has k one never got big in 

2492
01:39:16,370 --> 01:39:16,370
America.
Why?

2493
01:39:16,370 --> 01:39:18,990
They don't have an american champion 
debit american champions in America.

2494
01:39:19,010 --> 01:39:20,570
K one,
but that,

2495
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:23,280
that guy doeSn't do good in the,
at the final tournament.

2496
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:28,630
So,
but one's an american guy is going to 

2497
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:28,630
read in Japan.
You watch.

2498
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:31,230
Then k one becomes very interesting for 
the people in his logic.

2499
01:39:31,231 --> 01:39:32,790
You know,
you want to root for your own guy.

2500
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,900
That's funny though because you know,
mean horse crazy when he wanted America.

2501
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:39,540
He was a hugely popular guy and he's 
from Brazil.

2502
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:41,850
I think if they had k one over in 
America.

2503
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:43,380
I just think people are,
you know,

2504
01:39:43,381 --> 01:39:48,381
dana white and I had a conversation 
about this and he was talking about how 

2505
01:39:48,381 --> 01:39:50,280
his kickboxing as a negative stigma in 
America because of pka karate,

2506
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:54,990
old boring kickboxing is to have en esa 
kicks above the waist or something.

2507
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:58,710
You couldn't even kIck low,
kick low at all.

2508
01:39:58,711 --> 01:40:00,570
Very few of the.
I mean they would occasionally,

2509
01:40:00,571 --> 01:40:04,790
they would show you a low kick fight 
with special rules or special rule dutch

2510
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:10,730
for the most part.
It was like they would wear those big 

2511
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:10,730
stupid slippers on their feet and they 
wouldn't really care.

2512
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:15,260
It wasn't exciting.
It wasn't nearly as exciting as boxing 

2513
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:15,260
or more time,
but the one now,

2514
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:17,340
if you watched the grand prix now that's
bizarre.

2515
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:19,680
So she'll ever so exciting.

2516
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:21,270
But asher and max as well,
you know,

2517
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:24,440
the lighter weight guys and your patrol 
zen.

2518
01:40:24,450 --> 01:40:25,920
I mean,
unbelievable,

2519
01:40:25,921 --> 01:40:30,921
right?
Tell me that I couldn't be a star in 

2520
01:40:30,921 --> 01:40:30,921
America or um,
you know,

2521
01:40:30,921 --> 01:40:30,921
allister especially.
Yeah.

2522
01:40:30,921 --> 01:40:33,840
But the thing is in the beginning it 
will work,

2523
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:36,990
but eventually people want to see an 
american american champion.

2524
01:40:36,991 --> 01:40:37,530
Well,
I think it,

2525
01:40:37,650 --> 01:40:39,510
if it was really big and successful over
here,

2526
01:40:39,511 --> 01:40:40,260
you would have,
you know,

2527
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:42,920
some americans that would do well,
but they would have to,

2528
01:40:43,190 --> 01:40:46,330
they would have to know that that's a 
legitimate avenue for professional,

2529
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:48,320
that barry,
you know,

2530
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:50,850
guys who are real serious fucking 
strikers,

2531
01:40:51,090 --> 01:40:52,980
you know,
you're just not that many of them.

2532
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,070
There is no,
no,

2533
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,160
just really not.
And,

2534
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:55,960
and,
and you know,

2535
01:40:55,970 --> 01:40:57,850
to,
in America it's just,

2536
01:40:57,851 --> 01:41:02,851
there's no venue.
They have to go out out of the country 

2537
01:41:02,851 --> 01:41:02,851
to get like real high level.
It's very hard.

2538
01:41:02,851 --> 01:41:03,700
It's very.
Maureen schmidt would say,

2539
01:41:03,701 --> 01:41:05,690
you know,
he wasn't a top of the pyramid that time

2540
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,390
and he didn't make a dove there.
So then,

2541
01:41:07,391 --> 01:41:08,140
you know,
they go like,

2542
01:41:08,141 --> 01:41:08,920
okay,
well gus,

2543
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:10,960
who was going to beat mari smith did in 
America.

2544
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:12,140
Nobody.
Right,

2545
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:14,120
right.
Maurice,

2546
01:41:14,330 --> 01:41:17,260
that was another interesting guy.
When he first came to the ufc,

2547
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:19,720
I was there for his debut.
I was there when he fought.

2548
01:41:19,721 --> 01:41:21,290
Mark coleman.
No,

2549
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:22,570
but he gave him a chance.
You know,

2550
01:41:22,571 --> 01:41:24,130
everybody thought maurice is going to 
get killed.

2551
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,590
I remember backstage,
he's so relaxed.

2552
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:29,350
He was hanging out and goofing around 
and laughing.

2553
01:41:29,351 --> 01:41:30,010
I'm like,
does this guy,

2554
01:41:30,011 --> 01:41:35,011
nobody's going to go get fucked by the 
biggest guy in the game.

2555
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:37,400
You know,
Mark Coleman was a fucking month lawyer,

2556
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:43,260
but maurice just.
It was the first guy to have like that 

2557
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:43,260
real high level cardio,
you know?

2558
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:47,471
It was the first guy that just not get 
tired and he knew mark was going to get 

2559
01:41:47,471 --> 01:41:49,960
tired and I fought him.
I fought him twice or submitted him,

2560
01:41:49,961 --> 01:41:50,890
didn't you?
Yeah,

2561
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:51,790
josh.
Yeah.

2562
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:52,840
It was fun,
you know,

2563
01:41:52,841 --> 01:41:57,841
to the best one was the first time I'm 
standing here and he makes sure you 

2564
01:41:57,841 --> 01:41:58,770
could go punch,
punch him and it goes.

2565
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:02,050
It goes real fast and right away I give 
him a hickey booth and it like,

2566
01:42:02,051 --> 01:42:04,750
it's honest defects glide very close.
So I think,

2567
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:09,780
oh cool.
I'll make another one right away and 

2568
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:11,461
make switch kick and a kick and a suit,
but a fall into grant and he wants to 

2569
01:42:11,461 --> 01:42:11,461
jump on top of me and I go,
wait.

2570
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:16,890
He stops and I get up and I go,
yeah,

2571
01:42:18,050 --> 01:42:18,970
he's listened to.

2572
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:20,180
Yeah.
You got to see that fight.

2573
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:22,330
Is the funniest thing.
Hey,

2574
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:24,670
is legal right?
That's hilarious.

2575
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,420
Yeah,
that was hilarious.

2576
01:42:25,421 --> 01:42:27,580
That's funny.
And then he tried to take my back.

2577
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:32,610
ThIs was the coolest.
I did a minibar upside down knee bar on 

2578
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:33,460
my hat,
feet up knee.

2579
01:42:33,461 --> 01:42:38,461
BarrIng him,
I'm standing against the ropes and he's 

2580
01:42:38,461 --> 01:42:39,610
trying to get my back.
So as dove down on a knee bar,

2581
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:40,480
that's it.
I go like,

2582
01:42:40,481 --> 01:42:41,440
okay,
get my back.

2583
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:42,350
So right away.
But he did.

2584
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:47,490
I dove in but he grabs the ropes.
So I'm standing on the top of my have 

2585
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:51,310
the nepa is he's tapping into rope rope 
escaping.

2586
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:52,780
Wow.
Yeah,

2587
01:42:52,781 --> 01:42:57,781
that was wild man.
You were really there for some crazy 

2588
01:42:57,781 --> 01:43:00,991
times.
What is it like now going from like 

2589
01:43:00,991 --> 01:43:03,990
your,
your very beginnings where there was no 

2590
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:03,990
mixed martial arts where you went over 
there,

2591
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:06,220
you literally had no idea what it was 
like to seeing what it's like now,

2592
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:11,400
you know,
with like cain velasquez and all these 

2593
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:11,400
guys,
you know,

2594
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:11,400
unbelievable.

2595
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:12,730
He gets to understand that.
But I came from thai boxing,

2596
01:43:12,731 --> 01:43:13,680
right?
Shoot,

2597
01:43:13,681 --> 01:43:18,410
you get weight classes in boxing.
So I came to Japan and,

2598
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:23,430
and the first thing I see is my 
opponents who 245 pounds and I'm 195.

2599
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:25,480
So I go like,
okay,

2600
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:27,760
but I didn't want to show anything of 
course because okay,

2601
01:43:27,761 --> 01:43:29,200
this is what it is.
Why did you go to fight?

2602
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,190
So I go,
okay,

2603
01:43:30,191 --> 01:43:30,610
cool.
Cool,

2604
01:43:30,611 --> 01:43:31,020
cool.
Cool.

2605
01:43:31,021 --> 01:43:32,920
So how many routes to say one round?
I said,

2606
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:34,030
awesome.
How many minutes?

2607
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:35,890
Thirty.
Say awesome.

2608
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:39,930
I didn't think inside austin.
I go minutes.

2609
01:43:40,210 --> 01:43:42,040
I'm going to find 30 minutes.
You know?

2610
01:43:42,041 --> 01:43:45,700
That's why I put those ars on my hand.
I had to stay relaxed because I'm such a

2611
01:43:45,701 --> 01:43:46,570
hot at.
oh,

2612
01:43:46,571 --> 01:43:47,990
that's what the r stood for.
Yeah.

2613
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:48,900
Relaxed.
Yeah.

2614
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:51,620
In holland listing starts with an r 
also.

2615
01:43:51,621 --> 01:43:52,140
So let's go

2616
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:54,170
into that list.
No,

2617
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:54,500
no,
no,

2618
01:43:54,501 --> 01:43:55,070
no.
Stay,

2619
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:56,970
stay conflict.
Every time when,

2620
01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:59,210
when I get hit,
you hear my corner,

2621
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:00,410
you listen to the fights,
he goes,

2622
01:44:00,411 --> 01:44:01,310
stay calm,
stay calm,

2623
01:44:01,311 --> 01:44:06,311
stay calm.
Because they know that that's why in 

2624
01:44:06,311 --> 01:44:06,311
holland,
but old first one,

2625
01:44:06,311 --> 01:44:06,900
gosh,
I will come out very technical bap.

2626
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:07,260
Boom.

2627
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:11,990
Crazy.

2628
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,440
It's crazy.
So I figured,

2629
01:44:13,441 --> 01:44:13,920
I said,
man,

2630
01:44:13,921 --> 01:44:15,780
if I'm going to fight a guy like working
with Sean Hill,

2631
01:44:15,850 --> 01:44:20,850
you know who can take a lot of 
punishment but then come back and they 

2632
01:44:20,850 --> 01:44:21,980
got 28 more minutes to go,
woo,

2633
01:44:21,981 --> 01:44:23,460
we're gonna shoot load.
I don't want to Have that.

2634
01:44:23,461 --> 01:44:27,240
So I put a two hours of my hand didn't 
and they never showed,

2635
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:30,330
shouted into an instruction to only 
instruction day shout.

2636
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,580
It's like when I'm in a guard I will 
tell them,

2637
01:44:32,581 --> 01:44:33,720
right,
this is my easiest.

2638
01:44:33,721 --> 01:44:34,830
God escaped,
but it blended.

2639
01:44:35,370 --> 01:44:38,700
Imagined the goddess here and his left 
foot is on top.

2640
01:44:38,730 --> 01:44:39,280
Right,
right.

2641
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:44,750
I would look at my corner and it would.
So it would go right and I would swim 

2642
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:48,891
back and under who kids and grandkids,
they will be the eyes for me and I 

2643
01:44:48,891 --> 01:44:50,700
filled this day,
I don't get it that nobody knows.

2644
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:52,890
This is the simplest thing on the 
blended.

2645
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:56,570
Got to know which foot is on top.
So you can push up.

2646
01:44:56,610 --> 01:44:57,950
Yeah.
Because it's not being held.

2647
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:02,070
And just look at him and they go right.
And then you relax and we'll pick it up.

2648
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:02,760
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2649
01:45:02,761 --> 01:45:04,730
Do you do that for your guys as well?
Oh yeah.

2650
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:05,270
Yeah,
I did.

2651
01:45:05,271 --> 01:45:06,630
And also yeah,
you to be careful.

2652
01:45:06,631 --> 01:45:08,040
You don't get kind of triangle though.
No.

2653
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,520
Now you gotta you know,
you know that right?

2654
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:13,820
This is not like while he's pulling on 
your arm.

2655
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:16,980
Let's try it now.
Now how am I meant?

2656
01:45:16,981 --> 01:45:18,060
Plays.
How crazy is it?

2657
01:45:18,061 --> 01:45:23,061
Watching the evolution of the game has 
mean we literally in America there has 

2658
01:45:23,061 --> 01:45:28,041
never been a sport like mixed martial 
arts that has exploded and changed and 

2659
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:30,510
grown right before our eyes mean for 
some sports.

2660
01:45:30,511 --> 01:45:35,511
Got famous like skateboardIng and bmx 
riding me some stuff that wasn't a 

2661
01:45:35,731 --> 01:45:38,340
viable way to make a living when I was a
kid became one.

2662
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:42,990
Not thing like mixed martial arts where 
it was just constantly in the public eye

2663
01:45:42,991 --> 01:45:46,080
in movies and jammed down your throat on
television.

2664
01:45:46,081 --> 01:45:48,240
I mean it's pretty fucking strange,
isn't it?

2665
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:49,220
It's.
I,

2666
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:52,170
I predicted it right away after my fIrst
fight,

2667
01:45:52,171 --> 01:45:53,540
they did an interview with me and I 
said,

2668
01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:58,570
this is like a roller bowl.
That movie this people gonna need like 

2669
01:45:58,570 --> 01:45:58,570
an outlet.
You know,

2670
01:45:58,570 --> 01:46:00,830
and this is it,
this is going to be very big.

2671
01:46:00,831 --> 01:46:02,690
I say you're watching four years from 
now.

2672
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:03,860
Oh no.
Yeah.

2673
01:46:03,861 --> 01:46:08,861
I said to four years from now,
this will be the biggest thing and it 

2674
01:46:08,861 --> 01:46:09,020
was like seven years later or something.
I was like way off in time,

2675
01:46:09,290 --> 01:46:11,300
but eventually it got there.
I go like,

2676
01:46:11,301 --> 01:46:13,100
what is,
what is better than this?

2677
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:18,280
I knew at that time already that 
everybody likes to be to know who's the 

2678
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:20,090
toughest guy on the planet and this is 
literally being the toughest guy.

2679
01:46:20,330 --> 01:46:25,330
I was an inside man made last week and I
was ashamed about a comment that I made 

2680
01:46:25,330 --> 01:46:27,360
against frank because we had a comment 
there.

2681
01:46:27,450 --> 01:46:28,250
One guy says,
oh,

2682
01:46:28,251 --> 01:46:32,450
we're mma is just like two guys rubbing 
against each other on the floor.

2683
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:35,920
And then I told him the story that I was
fighting frank and that,

2684
01:46:35,921 --> 01:46:37,910
uh,
I stood up and I said to frank,

2685
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:38,690
come up.
He says,

2686
01:46:38,691 --> 01:46:38,960
no,
no,

2687
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,000
you come down.
I shouldn't have come up fight like a 

2688
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:44,000
man,
you know.

2689
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,020
and I go,
I'm eating those words right now because

2690
01:46:45,050 --> 01:46:50,050
when I broke that guy shin bone,
because I had no clue how much power 

2691
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:50,630
that wasn't the joint,
you know,

2692
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:53,580
that really started making me think and 
I understood it.

2693
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:57,060
The ground guy can break whatever he 
wants in your body.

2694
01:46:57,690 --> 01:47:00,840
You got so much dominant power.
If I roll with guys,

2695
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,090
my students,
they rot a stand with me.

2696
01:47:03,091 --> 01:47:04,340
Then the ground,
because of the grant,

2697
01:47:04,341 --> 01:47:07,290
they say you always,
you're there standing,

2698
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:08,640
they can move around,
you know,

2699
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,320
and they get hell out of there.
He says,

2700
01:47:10,321 --> 01:47:12,930
but It's way harder underground.
So I go like,

2701
01:47:12,931 --> 01:47:13,770
wow,
listen,

2702
01:47:13,771 --> 01:47:15,510
I can dislocate,
break,

2703
01:47:15,511 --> 01:47:17,310
snap,
I can do whatever I want.

2704
01:47:17,311 --> 01:47:18,210
If I say,
okay,

2705
01:47:18,211 --> 01:47:21,660
your right arm is going to go,
your right arm is going to go to any guy

2706
01:47:21,661 --> 01:47:22,980
on the street,
you know,

2707
01:47:23,010 --> 01:47:25,770
I mean talking about power compared to 
knocking somebody out,

2708
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:31,100
you know,
I can put you to sleep back in some 

2709
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:31,100
crazy things with you

2710
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:32,350
stated the jujitsu that just came,
it just came out of nowhere.

2711
01:47:32,351 --> 01:47:33,250
I mean,
when I was a kid,

2712
01:47:33,251 --> 01:47:36,290
it was all about striking.
There was no one ever took judo.

2713
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:38,020
Yeah,
I wrestled in high school,

2714
01:47:38,021 --> 01:47:39,910
but you know,
I just did it as a sport,

2715
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:45,340
you know,
I got bored with it quick because it 

2716
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:45,340
just didn't seem like does anything 
going on,

2717
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:45,640
you know,
the guy down.

2718
01:47:45,641 --> 01:47:50,641
But it wasn't submitting,
submitting them and once jujitsu came 

2719
01:47:50,641 --> 01:47:50,641
along,
man,

2720
01:47:50,641 --> 01:47:52,960
it's amazing how much it's evolved.
You look at like mma,

2721
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:55,690
jujitsu,
that was an mma in 93.

2722
01:47:55,691 --> 01:47:57,870
And look at the digital you see now with
like chalk ray,

2723
01:47:58,750 --> 01:47:59,830
damien maia,
you know,

2724
01:47:59,831 --> 01:48:02,380
it's fucking so many levels above it.

2725
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:03,860
The thing is,
what I always say,

2726
01:48:03,861 --> 01:48:05,750
I say all the moves are pretty much 
invented,

2727
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:07,670
right?
But it's the setups.

2728
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:12,840
THey,
they found creative ways to go to a 

2729
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:15,731
particular move.
That is the cool part about mixed 

2730
01:48:15,731 --> 01:48:17,921
martial arts style.
If you have that setup that nobody 

2731
01:48:17,921 --> 01:48:18,770
noticed yet,
how many times do you remember the first

2732
01:48:18,771 --> 01:48:21,090
time that he had a condo?
Got a introduced upright?

2733
01:48:21,450 --> 01:48:23,330
You're the guy from the [inaudible] cab 
and they said,

2734
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:24,650
we call this anaconda.
That was,

2735
01:48:24,651 --> 01:48:29,651
no.
Garrett told me because nobody sort the 

2736
01:48:29,651 --> 01:48:29,651
freaking thing before.
Boom,

2737
01:48:29,651 --> 01:48:30,000
everybody start landing anaconda dark 
joke.

2738
01:48:30,001 --> 01:48:31,600
Same thing with suddenly there's the 
dark,

2739
01:48:31,601 --> 01:48:31,980
you know,
oh,

2740
01:48:31,981 --> 01:48:33,710
you can do it on the honor instead the 
armpit,

2741
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:36,830
you go to the sea.
So people start playing with it and they

2742
01:48:36,831 --> 01:48:40,740
create these different ways like d list 
or against the suck.

2743
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:46,000
What is the alert to italian guy?
The way he said the triangle choke up.

2744
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:49,400
I mean,
wow,

2745
01:48:49,401 --> 01:48:51,800
that was so cool.
It was so sneaky.

2746
01:48:51,801 --> 01:48:54,200
Slowly but surely that look,
you know,

2747
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:55,670
got a list at a school

2748
01:48:55,790 --> 01:49:00,790
are some master list or if dean lister 
was around the early ufc,

2749
01:49:01,190 --> 01:49:03,410
nobody had jujitsu like him 93,
you know?

2750
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:06,050
Even though crazy didn't,
his jujitsu was very basic.

2751
01:49:06,051 --> 01:49:07,480
It wasn't nothing like,
you know,

2752
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,410
the jujitsu that you see today,
you know,

2753
01:49:09,411 --> 01:49:14,411
there's,
there's a few guys that they say when 

2754
01:49:14,411 --> 01:49:14,411
they compare jujitsu,
they stay,

2755
01:49:14,411 --> 01:49:14,660
you know,
kicks in is a perfect example.

2756
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:17,450
People today,
even high level black belts,

2757
01:49:17,451 --> 01:49:20,030
that role with him,
just say that guy is on another level.

2758
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:22,280
There's just a few guys that are just,
you know,

2759
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:24,350
laboriel.
Ricardo laboriel is another one they say

2760
01:49:24,351 --> 01:49:25,820
about that.
He's just on another level,

2761
01:49:25,821 --> 01:49:28,550
just there's such a high level of 
jujitsu,

2762
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:32,960
but overall the level of jujitsu from 
the new guys like the marcello garcia,

2763
01:49:32,961 --> 01:49:33,560
as you know,
the,

2764
01:49:33,561 --> 01:49:37,900
these new guys coming along,
it's fucking says it's so high level.

2765
01:49:37,901 --> 01:49:40,190
It's so much more advanced than it was 
just 10,

2766
01:49:40,191 --> 01:49:41,420
15 years ago,
you know,

2767
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:45,310
the cool thing is with laborio and he 
sold me rolling the jokey mentioned in,

2768
01:49:45,530 --> 01:49:48,730
in China and sweatshirt there,
and then he switched show.

2769
01:49:48,731 --> 01:49:53,731
We started showing me things and I said 
what he could do with those particular 

2770
01:49:53,731 --> 01:49:54,880
leg looks at how we could do thIs and 
make it stronger.

2771
01:49:54,881 --> 01:49:56,770
And,
and he was sitting looking at and he was

2772
01:49:56,771 --> 01:49:58,720
like,
oh.

2773
01:49:58,721 --> 01:49:59,230
I said,
oh,

2774
01:49:59,231 --> 01:50:00,590
you thought I was a striker.
Right?

2775
01:50:00,591 --> 01:50:02,290
Then he goes,
I didn't know and it.

2776
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:07,360
And then it's finished that he wanted me
to come to american top team to teach 

2777
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,820
ground fighting seminar.
That is good stuff.

2778
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:11,650
Well,
it's good to have a fresh perspective.

2779
01:50:11,651 --> 01:50:12,450
You know what I mean?
You,

2780
01:50:12,451 --> 01:50:17,451
you never know that everybody has their 
own way of doing things that I haven't 

2781
01:50:17,451 --> 01:50:17,451
seen it before.
that's it know.

2782
01:50:17,451 --> 01:50:22,040
there's so many different techniques and
what people don't understand that don't 

2783
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,751
do jujitsu.
There's so many different techniques 

2784
01:50:24,751 --> 01:50:25,150
that are available.
It's like a,

2785
01:50:25,390 --> 01:50:27,670
it's like chess,
if you had a million pieces,

2786
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:32,290
so many different submissions and so 
many different transitions and chains of

2787
01:50:32,291 --> 01:50:34,770
submissions and new techniques and new 
counters and.

2788
01:50:34,830 --> 01:50:35,510
Yeah,
but I,

2789
01:50:35,511 --> 01:50:38,100
I believe in,
in as good to know them all.

2790
01:50:38,101 --> 01:50:40,440
But I mean for every fight you have to 
say,

2791
01:50:40,441 --> 01:50:45,441
okay,
I'm going to use this particular mode 

2792
01:50:45,441 --> 01:50:45,441
for that guy.
I don't go crazy on tHis student because

2793
01:50:45,441 --> 01:50:47,610
you know,
and then have those different setups.

2794
01:50:47,611 --> 01:50:52,611
That is the key man.
I would end set up one to four and go 

2795
01:50:52,611 --> 01:50:52,611
from one to four,
two to,

2796
01:50:52,611 --> 01:50:53,080
to back to what a boom car.

2797
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:54,130
What does he know?
I was like,

2798
01:50:54,131 --> 01:50:56,630
jake.
Jake shields is very basic.

2799
01:50:56,631 --> 01:50:58,250
He doesn't do a lot of different 
techniques.

2800
01:50:58,251 --> 01:50:59,090
Rear naked,
choke,

2801
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:04,110
armbar guillotine choke,
but he just fucking gets them and he 

2802
01:51:04,110 --> 01:51:06,590
knows that his path tells technIques is 
so sharp.

2803
01:51:06,650 --> 01:51:07,580
Yep.
what do you think?

2804
01:51:07,581 --> 01:51:12,581
So what do you think about guys today?
like when you look at these guys today 

2805
01:51:12,581 --> 01:51:12,581
and you know,
do you ever wish like man,

2806
01:51:12,581 --> 01:51:13,750
I was.
Did you ever say like,

2807
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:15,780
I came along too late?
Like what I,

2808
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:16,020
what?

2809
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:16,650
Why?
Yeah,

2810
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:17,610
on,
on,

2811
01:51:17,690 --> 01:51:18,730
on one side.
Yeah.

2812
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:23,760
But you know,
I always go with the glass is half full 

2813
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:23,760
with me.
You know,

2814
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:24,010
I,
I'm in a great position right now,

2815
01:51:24,011 --> 01:51:29,011
man.
I mean I got a movie coming up of a big 

2816
01:51:29,011 --> 01:51:29,011
part for this.
A note to Kevin James comedy,

2817
01:51:29,230 --> 01:51:30,550
you know,
I got the tv show.

2818
01:51:30,551 --> 01:51:32,590
My wife predicted that one also.
By the way,

2819
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:37,680
what's the inside?
I mean we go does a fourth year as 

2820
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:38,420
graduate.
It's.

2821
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:39,790
Oh,
and my wife when she's.

2822
01:51:39,791 --> 01:51:42,820
She predicted that I was going to be a 
fighter in Japan and I said,

2823
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:44,380
no,
because I'm not gonna fight.

2824
01:51:44,381 --> 01:51:46,270
She associated holiday,
you're going to go to Japan much.

2825
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:49,240
Six months later I'm in Japan.
Then two years into that,

2826
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:50,800
she looks at me weird again.
I said,

2827
01:51:50,801 --> 01:51:51,590
now what?
She,

2828
01:51:51,650 --> 01:51:53,820
we've got to go to America.
You're going to be in tv business.

2829
01:51:54,370 --> 01:51:59,370
Swear to god.
How'd you ever get to a part of the 

2830
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:01,870
grand theft auto?
like the men's room was probably one of 

2831
01:52:01,870 --> 01:52:01,870
the funnIest things.
are you going to ever do another one?

2832
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:03,130
What is it?
I haven't seen it.

2833
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:08,140
Oh,
go and youtube both inside the grand 

2834
01:52:08,201 --> 01:52:13,201
theft auto.
I would just sit there to watch his 

2835
01:52:13,201 --> 01:52:15,511
show.
His boss was and gta for that was as a 

2836
01:52:17,031 --> 01:52:20,200
disguise from bar fighting.
They saw it and what they did,

2837
01:52:20,201 --> 01:52:25,201
they gave me a script and I said,
can I tweak this thing and just say 

2838
01:52:25,201 --> 01:52:27,881
sure.
So I would start building sentences in 

2839
01:52:27,881 --> 01:52:28,990
the middle of the sentence.
I would stop and then restart it.

2840
01:52:28,991 --> 01:52:32,710
So it looks like I'm a total freak of 
cycle when I'm talking.

2841
01:52:32,711 --> 01:52:34,930
It's like really weird because it 
doesn't work.

2842
01:52:36,170 --> 01:52:37,240
And,
and the,

2843
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:40,360
the result when you see the result is 
one of my finer work man.

2844
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:44,200
I had to send people out there.
I say you can because they were cracking

2845
01:52:44,201 --> 01:52:44,680
up so

2846
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:46,170
hard out.
Know all the guys

2847
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:48,180
who have fought though.
You're the very best,

2848
01:52:48,181 --> 01:52:53,181
In my opinion,
at transitioning into a career outside 

2849
01:52:53,181 --> 01:52:54,300
of fighting and you do inside mma.
You do commentary,

2850
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:55,800
you're always do too,
by the way.

2851
01:52:55,980 --> 01:53:00,980
You and michael chavela when you did the
commentary for strike force for the 

2852
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:03,090
undercard so flagging best part of the 
night.

2853
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:04,650
I love that.
I love that.

2854
01:53:04,651 --> 01:53:06,830
You guys need to do it together.
I'd love she avello.

2855
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:09,480
I think it's fucking hilarious.
You guys together were awesome.

2856
01:53:09,481 --> 01:53:13,200
Somebody really needs to scoop you up 
and have you guys do more commentary.

2857
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:14,300
Yeah.
You know,

2858
01:53:14,370 --> 01:53:16,070
I,
I love to do again,

2859
01:53:16,071 --> 01:53:17,130
but just right now,
you know,

2860
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:19,230
this is one of those things that I 
thought I would never say,

2861
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:21,650
but I'm so busy I don't have the time 
for it anymore,

2862
01:53:21,860 --> 01:53:23,750
but anytime I have a chance,
like for instance,

2863
01:53:23,751 --> 01:53:25,250
now I go to brussels,
you know,

2864
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:29,270
and then I do this just like three days 
before I have to go to boston to shoot.

2865
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:31,190
Say why do you do it?
You don't need to do it.

2866
01:53:31,191 --> 01:53:31,550
I said,
yeah,

2867
01:53:31,551 --> 01:53:33,980
but I enjoy it.
I enjoy it so much to go there.

2868
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:36,740
And then I'm also the ring announcer and
they let me free.

2869
01:53:36,741 --> 01:53:38,360
I can slapped girls.
I do,

2870
01:53:38,361 --> 01:53:41,480
you know the fun stuff,
you know brussels that are mixed martial

2871
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:46,481
arts,
mixed martial arts and a k one 

2872
01:53:46,481 --> 01:53:46,481
tournament in our both at the same time 
finding.

2873
01:53:46,481 --> 01:53:48,500
I seen they had one before,
right?

2874
01:53:48,501 --> 01:53:49,820
Yeah.
Also on inside mma.

2875
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:51,940
Yeah.
Inside mit.

2876
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:53,290
By the way,
if you don't have hd net,

2877
01:53:53,291 --> 01:53:56,770
you're miSsing out.
Hd net is the best for watching fights.

2878
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:58,900
There's always k,
one k,

2879
01:53:58,901 --> 01:54:03,901
one max.
they have 100 different mfcs are one 

2880
01:54:03,901 --> 01:54:04,810
hunDred different mixed martial arts 
organizations.

2881
01:54:05,110 --> 01:54:07,330
Fights from Japan,
fights from europe.

2882
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:12,600
It's really weird.
And that's where inside mma your show's 

2883
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:12,600
on.

2884
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:12,600
Well I,
I,

2885
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:16,601
I love it.
And the thing I love about it is I see 

2886
01:54:16,601 --> 01:54:18,931
my old buddies again,
whether they're still fighting order 

2887
01:54:18,931 --> 01:54:21,811
now,
coaches from guys and initiate a new 

2888
01:54:21,811 --> 01:54:21,811
talent coming up,
you know,

2889
01:54:21,811 --> 01:54:22,990
and,
and we'll have him on the show,

2890
01:54:22,991 --> 01:54:24,550
you know,
who would have thought you've got to get

2891
01:54:24,551 --> 01:54:26,320
a bossy award.
You know,

2892
01:54:26,321 --> 01:54:31,321
like you,
you can win a bazi if you have The 

2893
01:54:31,321 --> 01:54:31,321
greatest knock out of the year or 
something.

2894
01:54:31,321 --> 01:54:31,630
How cool is that?
You know,

2895
01:54:31,710 --> 01:54:33,460
it's really want to start doing that 
thing.

2896
01:54:33,461 --> 01:54:36,460
And I think in the front of a live 
audience that will be called to do also,

2897
01:54:36,820 --> 01:54:39,130
but it's really getting that.
We never thought it was going to go like

2898
01:54:39,131 --> 01:54:40,050
that.
You know,

2899
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:42,220
when it just exploded from the half hour
show,

2900
01:54:42,221 --> 01:54:44,970
we went right away to an hour and now 
commercials are there.

2901
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:47,800
So that means we're doing a good thing 
with the hottest show on a hd net.

2902
01:54:47,890 --> 01:54:48,880
Yeah,
it's on man.

2903
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:50,470
It's great.
It's a really,

2904
01:54:50,471 --> 01:54:52,270
really fun show to watch.
Now.

2905
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:57,300
What about guys that you know that you 
started out with that have taken a lot 

2906
01:54:57,300 --> 01:54:57,770
of damage?
You know me.

2907
01:54:57,850 --> 01:54:59,970
You didn't take damage.
You took damage to your bio,

2908
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:04,980
you have tendinitis,
but you have no problem with your 

2909
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:04,980
thinking.
No.

2910
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:07,520
No.
But what is it like when you see guys 

2911
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:07,520
that do.
Because it disturbs the shit out of him.

2912
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:07,520
Really.
It's,

2913
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:12,430
it's really sad that we.
I know if you guys had started lisping 

2914
01:55:12,430 --> 01:55:13,190
and it's scary stuff,
you know the,

2915
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:16,040
the like arlovski fight now you know 
andre,

2916
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:18,190
you know I love this guy.
Really nice guy.

2917
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:21,260
Somebody I know he wants to fight and he
already wants to prepare for the expo.

2918
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:22,850
I think somebody should say,
you know what?

2919
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:23,780
Let's not do it.

2920
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,790
What do you think about the greg jackson
saying that he's going to get right back

2921
01:55:26,791 --> 01:55:28,110
in there and they're just going to fix 
it,

2922
01:55:28,111 --> 01:55:30,330
and he did did some things wrong,
but he's not done.

2923
01:55:30,331 --> 01:55:32,280
He's going to come back.
It'll be even sweeter than ever.

2924
01:55:32,580 --> 01:55:33,570
And I'm listening.
I'm talking.

2925
01:55:33,571 --> 01:55:34,430
I'm like,
motherfucker,

2926
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:37,710
do you know that this guy knocked 
unconscious times in a row?

2927
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:40,120
Can you can kill everything for the 
rest?

2928
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:41,290
You know,
I mean,

2929
01:55:41,291 --> 01:55:43,000
maybe he's,
he's not going to be a teacher.

2930
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:48,290
Nothing,
but it makes more sense that that's the 

2931
01:55:48,290 --> 01:55:48,290
bad thing also is like your legacy is 
going down.

2932
01:55:48,290 --> 01:55:53,001
When are you going to be a coach?
You're going to go to a gym to train 

2933
01:55:53,001 --> 01:55:53,130
with a guy who lost his lost seven 
fights.

2934
01:55:53,131 --> 01:55:57,060
Imagine you're a guy like that.
I'm not a dentist.

2935
01:55:57,070 --> 01:55:59,010
Doctor laskey,
I'm telling you right now.

2936
01:55:59,011 --> 01:56:01,170
Yeah,
so you know,

2937
01:56:01,171 --> 01:56:02,200
they should.
What I said,

2938
01:56:02,270 --> 01:56:03,660
what a should do,
should tell him,

2939
01:56:03,690 --> 01:56:04,250
okay,
you know,

2940
01:56:04,251 --> 01:56:06,150
as you're going,
you're not going to fight for a year and

2941
01:56:06,151 --> 01:56:11,151
in between we're going to do some 
grappling tournaments to keep the 

2942
01:56:11,151 --> 01:56:13,311
competition on there and if you're busy 
and it doesn't matter if you've been on 

2943
01:56:13,311 --> 01:56:14,730
those who cares about it,
just be busy with competition so you,

2944
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:17,910
you perform under pressure and then if 
everything feels good,

2945
01:56:17,911 --> 01:56:19,740
you know that maybe try it one more 
time,

2946
01:56:19,741 --> 01:56:21,090
but then really say,
okay,

2947
01:56:21,091 --> 01:56:23,840
if this is going to go the wrong way,
you really get a stop light.

2948
01:56:24,610 --> 01:56:26,780
You're off from the rogers fight.
Didn't.

2949
01:56:27,350 --> 01:56:29,180
Yeah,
but the 10th in my book,

2950
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:31,220
if I lost my student,
it was no.

2951
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:36,520
I would say no,
this has been shut off too many times 

2952
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:38,890
because I don't want to be that nail and
the gulf that's going to say god knows 

2953
01:56:38,890 --> 01:56:41,741
what happened.
What about a guy like alastar that got 

2954
01:56:41,741 --> 01:56:43,991
stopped a bunch of times.
I mean alastar got stopped I think nine 

2955
01:56:43,991 --> 01:56:45,110
times in his career.
Bobby hoffman knocked them out.

2956
01:56:45,111 --> 01:56:46,520
Chocolate.
Dell knocked him out.

2957
01:56:46,521 --> 01:56:48,920
So many guys stomped him and look at 
them.

2958
01:56:48,921 --> 01:56:50,060
Now.
I mean,

2959
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:52,070
I know the greatest comeback ever.
I know,

2960
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:52,960
but you,
you,

2961
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:54,830
um,
you see this fighting style,

2962
01:56:54,831 --> 01:56:55,640
how he fights.

2963
01:56:55,860 --> 01:56:57,130
He doesn't throw.
I was,

2964
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:59,100
I was looking at.
So let it go.

2965
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,000
Make three,
four shots pop pop up.

2966
01:57:01,001 --> 01:57:03,450
It doesn't do that.
Everything is single shots.

2967
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:06,630
His defense is perfectly boomp.
Boomp boomp.

2968
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:09,730
Every watch you know,
there is no three a write up,

2969
01:57:09,731 --> 01:57:12,390
a good left hook.
He is very good and he knows,

2970
01:57:12,391 --> 01:57:13,110
you know.
Yeah,

2971
01:57:13,111 --> 01:57:14,400
of course.
Tries not to get hit.

2972
01:57:14,550 --> 01:57:16,440
It's not to get hit and the and,
and,

2973
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:19,140
and is going to be hard for people to 
hit him.

2974
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:21,240
It's so much power,
you know?

2975
01:57:21,241 --> 01:57:21,720
I mean,
look,

2976
01:57:21,721 --> 01:57:25,110
it looked to striking his bizarre.
The guy is so strong is staked out.

2977
01:57:25,111 --> 01:57:27,160
HIs fence is getting really good.
Bridge submissions.

2978
01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:28,500
Growth control is really good.

2979
01:57:28,670 --> 01:57:33,670
No one has been like alister that won 
the grand prix and is a mixed martial 

2980
01:57:34,441 --> 01:57:35,280
arts champion.
Yep.

2981
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:40,340
Dream jen.
Strike strike force three builds pretty 

2982
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:40,340
fucking crazy.
Yeah.

2983
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:40,440
Yeah.
That's really cool.

2984
01:57:40,441 --> 01:57:41,670
So that's a guy,
you know,

2985
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:43,270
this is cool.
He trained in the early days,

2986
01:57:43,271 --> 01:57:45,420
she traded crystal month when I was 
training there,

2987
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:49,980
he had his broader valentine and I would
submit them and then they would,

2988
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:50,610
they,
they,

2989
01:57:50,611 --> 01:57:53,640
they're very competitive and then if I 
wouldn't come over there,

2990
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:55,170
they suddenly would call and they say,
oh,

2991
01:57:55,171 --> 01:58:00,171
we're at your gym.
We want to train now because now we're 

2992
01:58:00,171 --> 01:58:00,171
going to get you.
I said,

2993
01:58:00,171 --> 01:58:00,960
okay,
and then it went again and they say,

2994
01:58:00,961 --> 01:58:01,920
how is that possible?
I said,

2995
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:04,240
because I'm training to there,
you know,

2996
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:07,440
but I always said that's the guy.
Those are the guys because they,

2997
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:12,460
they keep them coming,
keep them coming and want more and 

2998
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:12,540
travel for it.
He wants it and the guy who really wants

2999
01:58:12,541 --> 01:58:13,980
it,
it really is like that.

3000
01:58:13,981 --> 01:58:18,981
It's like the book.
I always say the alchemists know if you 

3001
01:58:18,981 --> 01:58:18,981
set your goal,
you say,

3002
01:58:18,981 --> 01:58:19,770
that's where I want to go.
Whatever you do,

3003
01:58:19,771 --> 01:58:22,320
you don't get off the path,
you know you are going to get it.

3004
01:58:22,350 --> 01:58:25,770
I truly believed that there's something 
up there that helps you for that.

3005
01:58:25,970 --> 01:58:27,510
You know,
go,

3006
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:32,630
go relentless.
Don't walk over people though in order 

3007
01:58:32,630 --> 01:58:32,630
to get there.

3008
01:58:32,630 --> 01:58:34,760
Unless you're andre arlovski and you've 
been enough four times in a row.

3009
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:35,890
Yeah,
yeah,

3010
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:38,630
that's true.
But physically you have to stop and look

3011
01:58:38,631 --> 01:58:40,220
at it and go,
alright,

3012
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:41,770
what are we going to do here?
Yeah,

3013
01:58:41,771 --> 01:58:44,890
that's true.
I don't know how you say this.

3014
01:58:44,891 --> 01:58:47,800
I think that you.
How do you tell when to tell them?

3015
01:58:48,010 --> 01:58:53,010
I think that people inside,
deep down inside the foreigners know if 

3016
01:58:53,010 --> 01:58:54,760
they can become a champion or not.
I think they already know that.

3017
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:57,610
When I was finding and I started winning
in Japan,

3018
01:58:57,611 --> 01:58:59,200
when I get that ground game,
I look at my wife,

3019
01:58:59,201 --> 01:59:02,200
I say I think are going to be a real 
champion for this thing.

3020
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:04,600
I truly believe I can beat all these 
guys now.

3021
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:06,250
You know,
and then it started,

3022
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:07,870
you know,
I think you feel that.

3023
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:10,750
I think that that a fighter will 
actually knows himself.

3024
01:59:10,751 --> 01:59:12,490
They will keep on trying and keep 
trying,

3025
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:16,210
but I think once you know that it's not 
really there,

3026
01:59:16,211 --> 01:59:18,910
that that's not a good feeling.
They won't say it,

3027
01:59:18,970 --> 01:59:21,220
but it is just like the guy who you 
mount,

3028
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:23,290
you hit the turn onto begging to get 
choked.

3029
01:59:23,790 --> 01:59:26,070
A lot of these guys they give to joe.

3030
01:59:26,130 --> 01:59:27,870
Speaking of that,
what did you think about the fate of our

3031
01:59:27,871 --> 01:59:29,610
fight when frito was fighting a big 
foot?

3032
01:59:29,611 --> 01:59:31,230
I mean he gave up his back a couple of 
times.

3033
01:59:31,231 --> 01:59:33,300
He had to.
It was just too big.

3034
01:59:33,660 --> 01:59:34,290
It was too big

3035
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:36,370
actually.
Recently too big width.

3036
01:59:36,750 --> 01:59:38,990
nick.
too big and combination.

3037
01:59:38,991 --> 01:59:39,980
Yeah.
And then.

3038
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:44,000
And then being what?
Sixty pounds heavier or you know,

3039
01:59:44,001 --> 01:59:45,290
that's a big difference,
man.

3040
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:47,780
I always said I wanted weight class two.
Oh,

3041
01:59:47,781 --> 01:59:48,980
five to 35.
Yeah,

3042
01:59:48,990 --> 01:59:49,320
I agree.
No,

3043
01:59:49,650 --> 01:59:50,380
I agree.
Yeah,

3044
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:52,070
I agree.
It's too big of a leap.

3045
01:59:52,270 --> 01:59:57,270
Yeah.
Those big giant guys that are cutting 

3046
01:59:57,270 --> 01:59:57,270
weight to get down to 65,
that's a huge percentage.

3047
01:59:57,270 --> 01:59:59,790
They said that he was to.
You gained 25 pounds.

3048
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:02,760
Fucking head Looks like it's two nine 
guys.

3049
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:03,730
Big,
big.

3050
02:00:03,970 --> 02:00:08,970
When he got on top of fatal in mountain 
and you see how wide is it gives you 

3051
02:00:08,970 --> 02:00:10,300
like that's a giant person may get 
stopped by a big foot.

3052
02:00:10,330 --> 02:00:12,080
You can see the footprint still on his 
back.

3053
02:00:14,230 --> 02:00:15,520
Poor fader man.
That was a.

3054
02:00:15,521 --> 02:00:20,521
That was a tough thing to watch and it's
tougher even still to watch all those 

3055
02:00:20,521 --> 02:00:21,250
people that are behind him.
A fight again,

3056
02:00:21,251 --> 02:00:22,260
he should fight.
no,

3057
02:00:22,270 --> 02:00:22,510
no,
no,

3058
02:00:22,511 --> 02:00:22,870
no,
no.

3059
02:00:23,060 --> 02:00:28,060
They did.
The people boeing where they don't let 

3060
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:29,530
the fight continue.
I say his eye is closed and he can't see

3061
02:00:29,531 --> 02:00:31,150
anything coming from the left,
you know,

3062
02:00:31,250 --> 02:00:33,640
at all and really was going to be the 
same thing anyway.

3063
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:35,110
He's going to get taken down and 
smashed.

3064
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:36,190
That was.
That was it.

3065
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:41,300
Is it hard watching the guidelines?
You mean you watched them enter into 

3066
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:42,040
very hard ride and then see them get 
beat down like very hard.

3067
02:00:42,041 --> 02:00:42,590
Yeah.
That,

3068
02:00:42,591 --> 02:00:43,830
that,
that does something to you.

3069
02:00:43,831 --> 02:00:45,100
You know,
that you get a bushel.

3070
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:46,870
I do get a butcher from that.
It's a crazy thing,

3071
02:00:46,871 --> 02:00:51,871
right?
But in this game and the game of 

3072
02:00:51,871 --> 02:00:51,871
fighting,
we're going to see it no matter what I.

3073
02:00:51,871 --> 02:00:51,871
I meAn,
I was there for chocolate.

3074
02:00:51,871 --> 02:00:53,260
dell's debut,
I was there,

3075
02:00:53,261 --> 02:00:53,920
uh,
you know,

3076
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:56,870
for hector console.
So that was the guy's name.

3077
02:00:56,871 --> 02:00:57,850
We fought,
I forget the guy's name.

3078
02:00:57,851 --> 02:01:00,160
He fought.
I was there for that.

3079
02:01:00,161 --> 02:01:00,740
No way.
Gonzales,

3080
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:03,910
maybe I was there for that fight.
And then to get to see him,

3081
02:01:03,911 --> 02:01:08,911
you know,
all the way to the end of the rich 

3082
02:01:08,911 --> 02:01:08,911
franklin fight,
you know,

3083
02:01:08,911 --> 02:01:08,911
it's like,
wow,

3084
02:01:08,911 --> 02:01:08,911
you know,
seeing,

3085
02:01:08,911 --> 02:01:12,840
seeing guys like at the top,
at their most vibrant when they're just 

3086
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:14,560
dominant part with,
with chuck,

3087
02:01:14,561 --> 02:01:17,100
it's a mental thing.
But I also with chuck,

3088
02:01:17,110 --> 02:01:22,110
if he has the right person who,
who can talk to him that he's still 

3089
02:01:22,110 --> 02:01:22,430
hungry.
Like if he lands,

3090
02:01:22,431 --> 02:01:24,590
if he smells the victory he committee 
group.

3091
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:27,640
And the older negotiate is because of 
that.

3092
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,470
If you would step back,
relax.

3093
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:32,140
I mean he was doing really good against 
rich franklin.

3094
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:35,530
This guy is still to be the top guy.
That's his only defect with him.

3095
02:01:35,531 --> 02:01:38,140
It's not that he lost his timing and 
lost that.

3096
02:01:38,170 --> 02:01:39,980
It's only that he too hungry,

3097
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:41,180
you know,
he's been knocking out.

3098
02:01:41,181 --> 02:01:42,730
People do easy,
you know,

3099
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:45,230
and if that's the same,
you can also see what the training when,

3100
02:01:45,231 --> 02:01:50,231
when he fought couture,
you know that when he trains he puts 

3101
02:01:50,231 --> 02:01:53,411
everybody backwards.
And then sunday when couture came and 

3102
02:01:53,411 --> 02:01:53,420
start pushIng him backwards,
that was like,

3103
02:01:53,421 --> 02:01:53,810
whoa,
whoa,

3104
02:01:53,811 --> 02:01:54,200
whoa,
whoa,

3105
02:01:54,201 --> 02:01:54,710
whoa.
What now?

3106
02:01:54,711 --> 02:01:55,820
What?
He never was there.

3107
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:58,370
That fight made them again way better

3108
02:01:58,530 --> 02:02:01,330
after that because at or counterstrike.
Oh men.

3109
02:02:01,410 --> 02:02:06,410
Yeah.
He learned how to fire them off as he 

3110
02:02:06,410 --> 02:02:08,381
was moving backwards.
And one of my favorite guys stills 

3111
02:02:08,381 --> 02:02:11,161
amazing.
But he also lost the ability to take a 

3112
02:02:11,161 --> 02:02:11,161
punch.
I mean,

3113
02:02:11,161 --> 02:02:11,161
if you go back and watch his first 
fights,

3114
02:02:11,161 --> 02:02:12,520
like you ever watched the palae fight 
with.

3115
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:13,450
Oh my god.
Yeah.

3116
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:14,960
That was crazy.
It was a new vc,

3117
02:02:14,980 --> 02:02:16,100
right?
Yeah.

3118
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:20,490
That was bare knuckle or knockoff guys 
with the a's.

3119
02:02:20,491 --> 02:02:22,840
A net underneath the rope so you 
couldn't escape.

3120
02:02:23,410 --> 02:02:25,630
Get stuck in there.
And on top of paleo,

3121
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:27,550
punched hIm in the face with bare 
knuckles.

3122
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:32,640
People get stabbed in the eyes.
This will grab the ball rates,

3123
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:39,160
pedro size pants and crushed his dick 
and balls.

3124
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:43,900
He said he literally grabbed the guy by 
the conus is what the fuck.

3125
02:02:43,901 --> 02:02:45,250
And it was totally,
completely legal.

3126
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:46,660
I mean,
nobody had ever done it,

3127
02:02:46,661 --> 02:02:47,170
but gary.

3128
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,910
And that is anything.
God,

3129
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,910
were they allowed to bite though?
I have old,

3130
02:02:51,911 --> 02:02:52,420
uh,
you know,

3131
02:02:52,421 --> 02:02:53,590
well,
it's almost,

3132
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:59,100
I,
I read the book from a big job because 

3133
02:02:59,100 --> 02:03:01,861
I,
I wrote the foreword for the book and a 

3134
02:03:01,861 --> 02:03:01,861
man.
That'S a cool book.

3135
02:03:01,861 --> 02:03:02,860
What is your john's book?
It's wrong,

3136
02:03:03,860 --> 02:03:05,620
but do you think John Mccarthy?
No,

3137
02:03:05,710 --> 02:03:06,000
no,
no,

3138
02:03:06,010 --> 02:03:06,550
no,
no.

3139
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:08,840
What is this line?
Let's get it on.

3140
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:11,260
Let's get it on.
But that's sort of mills lanes.

3141
02:03:11,261 --> 02:03:15,090
LIne mills lane in boxing had that way 
before the u.

3142
02:03:15,090 --> 02:03:17,190
S yeah.
Well I don't even know.

3143
02:03:18,090 --> 02:03:20,350
Okay.
That was his thing.

3144
02:03:20,530 --> 02:03:22,660
And they liked,
had made some sort of an agreement where

3145
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:28,060
john was going to use it in mma and 
mills lane was going to use it in 

3146
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:28,060
boxing.
Okay.

3147
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:28,610
I remember when,
you know,

3148
02:03:28,611 --> 02:03:30,520
there was like some words that people 
were saying,

3149
02:03:30,521 --> 02:03:31,180
oh,
you know,

3150
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:33,130
only John Mccarthy can say let's get it 
on.

3151
02:03:33,131 --> 02:03:38,131
Because every referee's gotta figure out
a thing to say to martin gay is the one 

3152
02:03:38,131 --> 02:03:40,240
that started it.
Marvin gaye,

3153
02:03:40,241 --> 02:03:41,690
marvin gaye,
martin.

3154
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:43,810
Yeah.
well,

3155
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:44,470
I mean,
you know,

3156
02:03:44,471 --> 02:03:48,100
let's get it on real quick.
You've seen it all,

3157
02:03:48,101 --> 02:03:49,930
boss.
You've been there from the beginning.

3158
02:03:49,931 --> 02:03:50,690
You know,
you're a,

3159
02:03:50,691 --> 02:03:52,000
you're a real legend in this,
uh,

3160
02:03:52,001 --> 02:03:52,930
this crazy sport.

3161
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:58,280
I'm a very happy person.
I mentioned to you that have a lot of 

3162
02:03:58,280 --> 02:03:58,280
pain when I walk,
you know,

3163
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:02,091
everything hurts,
but it's been worth it and I know that 

3164
02:04:02,091 --> 02:04:02,340
with the stem cells and everything and 
something will pop up,

3165
02:04:02,730 --> 02:04:03,500
you know,
and uh,

3166
02:04:03,501 --> 02:04:04,440
and I'll,
I'll put it back.

3167
02:04:04,441 --> 02:04:05,570
I'm not going to fight anymore,
you know,

3168
02:04:05,571 --> 02:04:06,270
I'm,
I'm also,

3169
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:11,400
you know,
there's also a thing that I had went in 

3170
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:11,400
2,600
made to come back.

3171
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:13,980
I knew that like I would roll and 
everything would go really well,

3172
02:04:13,981 --> 02:04:16,800
don't get me wrong.
But there were thIngs that I say I would

3173
02:04:16,801 --> 02:04:19,050
have had that normally and normally I 
wouldn't have had that.

3174
02:04:19,140 --> 02:04:22,560
I noticed that I was getting slower,
you know,

3175
02:04:22,561 --> 02:04:25,980
and that,
that my reactIons were not there as they

3176
02:04:25,981 --> 02:04:28,020
were before.
So you know,

3177
02:04:28,021 --> 02:04:29,230
you gotta be,
you know,

3178
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:34,270
be very realistic to yourself.
when you think about a guy like randy 

3179
02:04:34,270 --> 02:04:34,560
couture's older than you.
I mean,

3180
02:04:34,561 --> 02:04:35,580
how old are you now?
Yeah,

3181
02:04:35,581 --> 02:04:38,810
but a 45,
40 6:40

3182
02:04:39,290 --> 02:04:42,090
about to fight with cheetah.
It's crazy.

3183
02:04:42,330 --> 02:04:46,080
But he has got the o two trainer,
the bastards invention,

3184
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:48,960
the lung thing device.
What is the trainer will,

3185
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:50,340
do you know what?
This is a fun thing,

3186
02:04:50,341 --> 02:04:50,800
man.
I,

3187
02:04:50,801 --> 02:04:52,080
I came up with this.
Yeah,

3188
02:04:52,590 --> 02:04:56,130
when I was 15 years old.
Around that time I had very bad asthma,

3189
02:04:56,520 --> 02:05:00,150
but I also did track and field.
So when I had an asthma attack that will

3190
02:05:00,151 --> 02:05:03,060
be like a two week episode.
Which of the two,

3191
02:05:03,061 --> 02:05:06,540
which I will be like five or six days in
bed because I couldn't eat.

3192
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:08,700
I couldn't breathe because she can't 
eat.

3193
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:13,110
She drink it because they'd like this 24
hours day.

3194
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:15,210
No.
Really bad,

3195
02:05:15,390 --> 02:05:16,680
so I couldn't watch.
There's nothing.

3196
02:05:16,681 --> 02:05:18,840
Everything about it.
You don't have any of that anymore?

3197
02:05:18,841 --> 02:05:19,320
No,
no,

3198
02:05:19,321 --> 02:05:20,250
no.
Sometimes I do.

3199
02:05:20,251 --> 02:05:21,600
Sometimes a little bit.
yeah,

3200
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:23,130
but you take an inhaler and it's gone.

3201
02:05:24,750 --> 02:05:27,600
But then after I had an attack and I 
will do track and field,

3202
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:31,110
I would realize that my launch would 
work better and I go,

3203
02:05:31,111 --> 02:05:32,310
why is that?
And I said,

3204
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:34,590
oh wait a minute,
there's an infection in your long pipe,

3205
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:36,330
you know,
it closes the long pipe.

3206
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:39,270
Your launch have to work really hard to 
pull that erin.

3207
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:43,530
Then when the infection is gone,
you know they at all because they worked

3208
02:05:43,531 --> 02:05:46,520
all the time to use to pulling heart.
Air comes in egg.

3209
02:05:46,770 --> 02:05:51,770
I go,
so why don't I come up with something 

3210
02:05:51,770 --> 02:05:52,680
that controls the air intake?
So I started thinking about like,

3211
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,710
it's the stupidest thing man.
You're going to learn.

3212
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:59,750
Like I will put my mouth in a shortened 
position and try to memorize that 

3213
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:03,281
position.
And I just stupid stuff so much aaron 

3214
02:06:03,281 --> 02:06:04,410
like and then every time a little 
smaller I go,

3215
02:06:04,411 --> 02:06:05,490
man,
I gotta come up with something.

3216
02:06:05,850 --> 02:06:08,310
So I tell all these,
all my buddies here in America,

3217
02:06:08,311 --> 02:06:11,340
everybody knew and the holidays also 
that I wanted to make that thing.

3218
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:14,730
And then when vandelay came on tv with a
snorkel,

3219
02:06:15,050 --> 02:06:20,050
I think I had six or seven phone calls.
they said you gotta do that thing that 

3220
02:06:20,050 --> 02:06:22,260
you're talking about because somebody's 
gonna find it out.

3221
02:06:22,261 --> 02:06:24,630
Somebody is going to come up with an 
idea,

3222
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:30,080
you know.
So I started to look and at a patent 

3223
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:30,080
lawyer and what do you know,
man?

3224
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:31,910
Nobody made it.
I got the better.

3225
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:36,210
Have everything that is good to traIner 
the o two trainer.

3226
02:06:36,250 --> 02:06:38,010
That's why I was laughing because what I
saw this,

3227
02:06:39,580 --> 02:06:42,930
let's do a trainer and it's a,
it controls the air intake.

3228
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:47,960
It's a very simple thing.
So imagine this week you do all your 

3229
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:51,891
hard workouts like only four times also 
because you don't need to do it anyway 

3230
02:06:51,891 --> 02:06:53,340
because she actually toning your muscles
to testing it.

3231
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:56,520
In Texas right now at a university,
that guy in 12 days,

3232
02:06:56,521 --> 02:06:58,170
he had greater lung volume.
He said,

3233
02:06:58,171 --> 02:06:59,820
man,
you made something really cool.

3234
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:02,610
Can I puT my trek team on it?
he's got his female trek demonic,

3235
02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:06,120
they're gonna run tests on them now 
because he thinks also that because it's

3236
02:07:06,121 --> 02:07:11,121
a little small dive,
biodegradable little compartment that's 

3237
02:07:11,121 --> 02:07:13,580
flexible also should get get hurt 
because you rebreathe a little tiny bit 

3238
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:16,260
of carbon monoxide,
which I wanted to stay away from because

3239
02:07:16,261 --> 02:07:17,370
I don't want people to get this.
He says,

3240
02:07:17,371 --> 02:07:17,730
no,
no,

3241
02:07:17,731 --> 02:07:21,270
you don't get carbon dioxide.
Would I want it to.

3242
02:07:21,870 --> 02:07:22,650
Anyway,
he says,

3243
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:27,570
he thinks it's just enough to spark a 
more red blood cell production.

3244
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:28,800
I said,
You're kidding me.

3245
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:30,360
Is that?
I don't know for sure yet.

3246
02:07:30,361 --> 02:07:31,180
he says,
but I die.

3247
02:07:31,181 --> 02:07:34,500
That will be the icing on the cake.
What doeS this thing look like?

3248
02:07:35,190 --> 02:07:36,000
It's in,
um,

3249
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:37,500
you know,
she,

3250
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:40,330
I hope I still get better at it online.
Can I find it online?

3251
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:43,000
Um,
let me see.

3252
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:47,500
You go to [inaudible] dot com and people
who are watching right now,

3253
02:07:47,501 --> 02:07:49,810
you can't buy it yet.
It's on there,

3254
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:52,780
but you can buy a jet.
So don't hit by.

3255
02:07:54,510 --> 02:07:54,870
Hmm.

3256
02:07:55,530 --> 02:07:57,640
O two trainer.com.

3257

And this is something that's going to be
available soon?

3262
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,080
Very soon.
This week.

3263
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:13,050
This week?
Yeah.

3264
02:08:13,170 --> 02:08:14,070
What does it look like?
I can.

3265
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,890
Because it's not.
It's not coming back up again.

3266
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:21,280
Oh hey.
You're probably getting smashed right 

3267
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:21,280
now.
You just said.

3268
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:21,280
Yeah.
You said it online.

3269
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:22,290
You almost have these 40,000
people in use.

3270
02:08:23,170 --> 02:08:24,340
Yeah.
Okay guys.

3271
02:08:24,341 --> 02:08:26,320
Everybody you're watching.
Don't buy it.

3272
02:08:26,510 --> 02:08:28,930
You cannot buy it a gay.
It's not in.

3273
02:08:28,931 --> 02:08:31,840
So don't hit by.
Come back at the end of the week.

3274
02:08:31,870 --> 02:08:32,430
Do you have.

3275
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:35,590
So it will be something that you think 
is going to be make a big impact.

3276
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:38,190
I think it's going to be the maJor 
impact because you look at it,

3277
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:39,540
describe what it looks like.
Okay.

3278
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:42,820
This is a portable device.
It's a mouthpiece,

3279
02:08:42,821 --> 02:08:45,280
like in a,
like when you die you don't let struggle

3280
02:08:45,610 --> 02:08:47,650
and it got to the front with two little 
things.

3281
02:08:47,670 --> 02:08:52,080
It's like a square and it comes to the 
front here as the air a whole.

3282
02:08:52,081 --> 02:08:54,850
And as a cap,
the cap you can take off and you can put

3283
02:08:54,851 --> 02:08:57,970
screens in their little rubber screens 
with all smaller holes,

3284
02:08:57,971 --> 02:09:00,460
they go from 40 millimeter all the way 
to one millimeter.

3285
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:03,430
So this week you train all your hard 
work has 14 millimeter.

3286
02:09:03,431 --> 02:09:06,390
Next week you do 13,
then you do 12 ego slowly,

3287
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:09,670
but gradually you're going down.
And then once you're down you know,

3288
02:09:09,671 --> 02:09:10,210
you,
you,

3289
02:09:10,211 --> 02:09:13,340
you really allergic to pull the air in.
And it's,

3290
02:09:13,341 --> 02:09:14,830
it's the,
the voice.

3291
02:09:14,831 --> 02:09:19,831
My wife was saying like,
after three weeks of training in 

3292
02:09:19,831 --> 02:09:19,831
restaurants,
she said,

3293
02:09:19,831 --> 02:09:20,620
you know,
we've got your forest gets really loud.

3294
02:09:20,621 --> 02:09:22,060
So I go bed.
It's for singers.

3295
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:24,250
It's for people who play more 
instruments.

3296
02:09:24,251 --> 02:09:25,900
It's for,
for scuba divers.

3297
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:28,030
Anybody who needs a lung,
you know,

3298
02:09:28,031 --> 02:09:30,010
you should see the commercial,
whether that I made for it.

3299
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:32,410
We shut that thing in 15 minutes or 
less.

3300
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:34,450
And you're going to laugh.
You as of when you see that thing,

3301
02:09:34,451 --> 02:09:34,860
you're going to go,

3302
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:36,550

3327
02:10:28,051 --> 02:10:30,680
Literally sit here and just do it.

Excuse me.
The men's room is occupied and now for 

3335
02:11:05,190 --> 02:11:06,390
your hosts,
bas rutten.

3336
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:07,730

3338
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:15,130
Met with a good scale.
Good.

3339
02:11:16,470 --> 02:11:21,470
Hi everybody.
My Name is bas route and I'm welcome to 

3340
02:11:21,470 --> 02:11:22,410
the men's room.
Yeah,

3341
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:23,840
we're men can hang out.
Okay.

3342
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:27,940
Now we're going to get crushed on this 
show.

3343
02:11:27,970 --> 02:11:31,900
Will go to be discussing a lot,
a lot of aspects of health,

3344
02:11:32,110 --> 02:11:37,110
especially how to endanger the health of
others with others.

3345
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:42,680
Did you not meet our stuff?
We've got relationship advice,

3346
02:11:42,730 --> 02:11:47,730
like how to avoid losing the face.
We're going to take some calls advising 

3347
02:11:47,730 --> 02:11:50,020
women how to deal with their men,
but that's pretty easy,

3348
02:11:50,021 --> 02:11:50,890
right?
I mean,

3349
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:55,920
it's just that didn't need to do is get 
through the groin right there and when 

3350
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:58,330
your body connects with the reproductive
organs of another man,

3351
02:11:58,660 --> 02:12:01,470
let me tell you buddy.
It's pain and beauty.

3352
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:03,370
Also,
we had a special,

3353
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:05,830
and we call this special,
the cubicle,

3354
02:12:05,890 --> 02:12:09,370
the copier,
as stabbing a coworker in the eye with a

3355
02:12:09,371 --> 02:12:12,350
little pencil like this.
Look at the.

3356
02:12:12,510 --> 02:12:17,510
The blueprint is going and I'm going to 
be.
