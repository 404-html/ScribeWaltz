1
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,250
Okay,
yeah.

2
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,270
Put Your Rogan's podcast.
Birthday all bitches millionaires 

3
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,490
smoking bag.
Bring Dope scratching,

4
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,820
scratching.
I love that dude's voice.

5
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,680
That dude's got some serious.
Sold his voice.

6
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,050
I can listen to the beginning of that 
song 100 times in a row.

7
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,380
I don't care how gay it sounds to 
follow.

8
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,950
Blaming me.
I love that fucking song.

9
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,050
I know it's stupid song.
I don't care.

10
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,620
You know what I mean?
There's some songs where you're 

11
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:15,620
embarrassed that you love him.
I love that fucking song.

12
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,630
I don't give a shit.
If you like sublime,

13
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,850
you would like that.
That's like a sublime to 11.

14
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,950
That would wrap.
Got that vibe.

15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,240
Especially when I saw him.
I'm like,

16
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:25,200
wow,
what a weird looking dude.

17
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:26,610
He's tattooed all the way up to his 
neck.

18
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:28,440
Real skinny little happy,
friendly guy.

19
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,130
Don't get me wrong.
I would like to be a billionaire as 

20
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,171
well,
but not feeling the flashlight is 

21
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:36,750
sponsoring this my birthday podcast and 
all of the podcasts.

22
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,630
If you haven't fucked one,
you don't know what you're missing.

23
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,280
Joey,
have you fucked one flesh?

24
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,590
It's been so long.
It just turned into a straight 

25
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:50,930
commercial.
Let me get this fucking who I still talk

26
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:51,750
about it.
Make it shorter.

27
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,610
Make it short and sweet.
It's like I'm a representative for the 

28
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:57,610
flashlight.
I liked that line.

29
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,571
Did you rehearse?
It was the first time you got to drop a 

30
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:02,580
link in it before,
but it didn't reverse at the joint.

31
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,800
Yeah,
we got to actually make a commercial for

32
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:09,801
it.
Not only are you sick and tired of 

33
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:13,721
waking them up by yourself and out the 
fucking window waiting for Cinderella 

34
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:15,520
coming cock sucker from the flashlight 
is here.

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,540
Pick it up and fuck one of these things 
in the ass and the amount you could fuck

36
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:25,801
around with how you want your.
Close Your eyes and you're that open up 

37
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:25,801
the flashlight.
Show what's inside.

38
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:29,060
It's a clean white little monkey.
Shaving the assholes clean.

39
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,190
No hemorrhoids.
That's how they do it.

40
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:32,120
Over that,
the flashlight.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,360
You stick a finger or two fingers.
You can practice whatever you want to 

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,240
do.
Here we have happy customers.

43
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,710
Read bed.
Tell me about the fleshlight.

44
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:41,330
Smells great.
Tremendous.

45
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:43,260
After you wash it off,
before you fucking know.

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,240
After you.
Fuck it.

47
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,330
I love it.
Another word from westlake coming weird 

48
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:49,460
and everybody out again.

49
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,530
It smells great after you fuck it.
Oh Jesus.

50
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,710
Load smell terrible.
When you leave them in your stomach,

51
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,910
you know you get like a little puddle in
the summer and you leave a load in your 

52
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,040
belly button and it smells like dead 
fish.

53
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,540
What the fuck?
Or if you ever like jerk off and you're 

54
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,791
so lazy,
you don't even bother cleaning off your 

55
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,660
balls and your balls smell like fish.
That's happened like two or three times,

56
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:14,590
but my balls and smelled like fish 
though.

57
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,840
I'll tell you what I do is dry and 
crusty.

58
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,850
How much moisture you're generating down
there.

59
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,580
This is what I said.
It's like a jungle son.

60
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,440
I got the treadmill next.
I hold the top of the total there and 

61
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:28,770
the cop comes in,
swells up like a fucking balloon.

62
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:33,771
You know what I'm saying?
The toilet and opened up the gentleman 

63
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:34,080
there.
You know what I'm saying?

64
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,610
So it pays to be uncircumcised.
Cocks up.

65
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,410
You hold the tip when you're ready to 
come and the cop comes up.

66
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:45,411
But it swells up like a balloon and you 
just hold and draw that teach science 

67
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:47,960
bitches.

68
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,580
How funny is that?
It's a common practice to cut your Dick 

69
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,090
when you're born.
That's the most common thing,

70
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,030
right?
Why are you even talking about.

71
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,320
I mean he would if pussies came all 
trimmed back.

72
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,030
We've pushed these,
came out,

73
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:04,800
trim back and expose them.
Because of that,

74
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:07,200
they weren't as sensitive and you know,
the.

75
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,030
We just got used to the way they looked 
in their trim back and expose.

76
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,710
We got mad at girls.
Had Lips like it.

77
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,070
What do you have Pussy Lips for?
Those are gross.

78
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:19,071
I can't even see the pussy.
It's all covered in his fucking pussy 

79
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,071
lip.
It's just a matter of perception.

80
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,991
You just get used to it.
There's nothing that's smart about 

81
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:24,500
cutting a kid's Dick.
Did you get your cut?

82
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,200
Fuck yeah.
I didn't want to ask me.

83
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,760
What would you want it not cut right 
now?

84
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,200
I think that's supposed to be the way 
it's supposed to clean your desk on my 

85
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,010
team,
like a motherfucker raised were probably

86
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:46,011
brainwashed,
but we were raised to believe that you 

87
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:46,011
got like 700 isn't circumcised.

88
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:47,750
It has a dirty deck.
We're raised to believe.

89
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,410
Well,
I know it's not true.

90
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,330
It's not true.
Fifty program that's not more mushrooms.

91
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:56,270
The highest self cleaning,
just like a woman's.

92
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:59,580
We just got to wash it more right 
outside and I don't shake it because the

93
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:04,581
cops are coming to some gonna smell,
but that's everybody in this room now 

94
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:05,980
say ours is built so it just has like a 
gutter.

95
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:08,160
It just drips right off into your inner 
legs.

96
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,510
Oh,
it's not a smart move.

97
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,100
You can't argue chopping the forest can 
offer.

98
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,300
That's just crazy.
You do lose sensitivity though.

99
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:15,660
Yeah.
You lose a lot of sensitivity.

100
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:17,580
It's supposed to feel much.
It's supposed to feel better.

101
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:18,730
I don't need help.
Kick your belly,

102
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:23,731
take it,
and I don't need any more knowing that 

103
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:25,050
sucks.
It's not less sensitivity.

104
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,050
It just would feel better.
How do you treat them like that?

105
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,110
More sensitive.
It doesn't necessarily mean you come 

106
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,110
quicker,
it just means it feels better.

107
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,240
Have you ever used a condom on a check 
so that you can last longer?

108
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,950
No.
You've never done that.

109
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,040
What about you Brian?
I use a condom on my flashlight so you 

110
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,951
can last longer as a disclaimer.
See right away we are high as fuck.

111
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,650
Alright.
So some of the stuff seems silly.

112
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,290
That's what's going on.
I just spoke with joy for five days.

113
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,980
I watch the Anderson Silva fight sober

114
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,660
like a priest bitches.
You understand me?

115
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,960
I held out to today because I want to 
look good for this thing and I'm going 

116
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,480
to buddy guy tonight and bb 
motherfucking king.

117
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,150
So I gotta save that Shit.
I'm getting fucked up tonight.

118
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:10,760
You understanding that Anderson Silva 
was insane.

119
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,740
What I fired my was dad.
There's no way.

120
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:19,160
There's anything in the world that gives
you that much entertainment,

121
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,220
that much drama that there's nothing 
like that.

122
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:25,700
There's no movie that can fuck with that
fight forever.

123
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,160
It's impossible to make a movie that's 
going to be as entertaining that draws 

124
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:33,500
you in like that.
So much emotion.

125
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,060
So much anger.
So much,

126
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,630
so much explosion,
so much fucking struggle.

127
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,160
So much.
It looks like all hope is lost.

128
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,390
Slaps on the triangle.
The fucking crowd goes crazy.

129
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,090
She also had the guy pretends not to tap
and it hangs in there.

130
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,530
You're like,
what the fuck is gonna happen here?

131
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,610
And they break it out.
Be like,

132
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:51,470
wow.
He fucking pulled it off.

133
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,000
He pulled it off,
man.

134
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,110
He.
He kept in there for five rounds and 

135
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,110
getting the fuck beat out of them 
getting taken down,

136
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,390
getting punished,
getting beat up.

137
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,880
Very little success on the fee.
Hits them a little bit,

138
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:04,430
but then it gets taken down every time 
for fucking rounds.

139
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:09,431
Chael Sonnen did that shit and he 
knocked him down and he knocked them 

140
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:09,431
down and people are giving them 10,
eight rounds.

141
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:10,460
He got some 10,
eight rounds.

142
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,460
That's rare.
It's rare you're going to take it round.

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,520
I used to argue with people at King of 
the cage all the time where they were 

144
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,900
really back in like 2000,
2001 there were seriously thinking about

145
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,930
making a 32nd ground rule because the 
groundwork is boring and it's all about 

146
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,670
putting asses in seats and I'm like,
what are you talking about?

147
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,860
The groundwork as bar?
Are you kidding me?

148
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,440
He goes,
what's someone getting put on a triangle

149
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,300
isn't as exciting to someone getting 
knocked out.

150
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,210
I go,
it all depends on the situation that not

151
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,340
in a prelim,
no one gives a fuck.

152
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,440
That's what it gets knocked out in a 
championship fight.

153
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,440
It's different and I mean it's all about
the situation.

154
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:47,720
That was Anderson Silva losing the 
fucking,

155
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,450
losing every round,
getting Jack.

156
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,270
He's,
he's invincible.

157
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,300
He's fucking everybody up.
He was going to crush son and son and 

158
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,110
does everything to everything right.
Takes him down,

159
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:02,960
stays away from submissions,
beat some standing,

160
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,450
knocked him down.
Um,

161
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,640
did everything right.
Everything was perfect.

162
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,090
And Anderson Silva out of his ass throws
up a fucking triangle and it sticks Joe 

163
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,290
Rogan because Joe Rogan goes where?
As soon as the fifth round started,

164
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,330
he goes,
it's chill southern.

165
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,740
How's he going to start to celebrate?

166
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,500
No.
I said,

167
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,790
is it too early for celebrate?
I'm like,

168
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,800
this is through the kiss,
but then you catch the drama over three 

169
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,210
minutes left.
You can never,

170
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,930
as long as he's acting thing can happen 
with that guy.

171
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,730
He to knock you out in one second.
He can get up.

172
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,330
He can get up out of nowhere.
You charge forward.

173
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,180
You get fucking flying kneed in the 
head.

174
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,810
I liked Carlos Newton.
Remember that fight?

175
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,820
Carlos Newton was dominating him on the 
ground.

176
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,910
He got back up to his feet.
They restarted him because he couldn't 

177
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,000
do anything on his feet and pride and he
fucking left through the air and slammed

178
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:55,200
Carlos Newton in the head with the 
flying knee and put them away.

179
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,340
He's a beast,

180
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,180
man.
He's a bad mother.

181
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,190
Anderson Silva is a

182
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,780
skin.
Didn't even break.

183
00:08:59,781 --> 00:09:01,760
He got hit 20,000
fucking times.

184
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:03,920
The skin didn't even break.
That's that credible.

185
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,780
That's that Brazilian lizard kid he's 
got.

186
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:07,470
You know what I'm saying?
I wanted that,

187
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,260
but my grandmother went their different 
directions.

188
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,620
He thought guys is tough as hell talking
about tough guys because I've always 

189
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:16,820
liked them.
I've heard pro and con,

190
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:19,550
but I've always liked him because he 
came up to me and talked to me.

191
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:20,990
It was very nice.
And that's the farm,

192
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,970
you know,
and I called the farmer Matt Hughes.

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I love him to death,
but after last week I just want to say 

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,461
something.
He did the remake of Chinese connection 

195
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:30,461
because he'd beat the whole fucking 
Gracie family.

196
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,350
It needs to do is wait for the Russian 
to come over.

197
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:36,570
You know what I'm saying?
He's got a handle on the lamppost.

198
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,840
And so the uncle of fucking,
the other wise voice one was the worst 

199
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:43,360
one.
I mean,

200
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,030
he's the voiced one crusher.
Ricardo.

201
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,140
So in other words,
Eddie,

202
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:51,350
you're off the hook.
How sweet was that movie?

203
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:52,790
Hit Him with.
He hit him with the,

204
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,960
that um,
they call it the headlock.

205
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,390
I guess I tried that last night.
Did you see man,

206
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,240
it's just,
man,

207
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,070
that's instructional.

208
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,480
No,
he put a thing on the,

209
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:06,000
uh,
under the mixed martial arts.com.

210
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,620
Josh.
Josh Barnett is,

211
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,220
you know,
he's,

212
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,250
he loves all that catch wrestling stuff.
He's a huge casserole catch wrestling 

213
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,311
fan,
so anytime there's like a move like 

214
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:18,291
this,
it's like that's a Dave Schultz 

215
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,611
headlock.
Dave Schultz and his brother Mark 

216
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:22,010
Schultz.
He's bad ass restaurants used to fuck 

217
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,481
people up.
They used to get them with like 

218
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:23,481
Camorra's and Shit and do a lot of 
illegal things.

219
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:24,450
Like they hit a Komora.
There's a beautiful video.

220
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:27,300
Have you ever seen the video of Schultes
hitting that Kamora and flipping the guy

221
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:28,200
over?
No,

222
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,320
it's pretty bad ass,
but it's totally illegal and wrestling 

223
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,320
and he's basically yanking the guy's 
shoulder out of socket,

224
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,940
throwing them over his head,
but a date they would just do like 

225
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,390
submissions in a real wrestling match.
Like there were famous for that shit.

226
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,510
They would put guys to sleep with this 
headlock and then roll them over on the 

227
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,661
back and the referee didn't even know 
the guy was unconscious and then they 

228
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:47,661
figured out what they were doing.

229
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:48,300
They stopped them from doing it.
Wow.

230
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,550
Yeah.
These two brothers that were so crazy.

231
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,950
Have you ever kill anybody?
Like go to your car or anything?

232
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,040
No they didn't.
But the crazy thing is there's a,

233
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,690
um,
I forget the guy's name,

234
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,260
my answer hunter,
who was the guy that killed them?

235
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,620
There was some guy who was this 
eccentric millionaire who used to pay 

236
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:06,870
wrestlers to come and work out with 
them.

237
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,900
That's what we wanted to do.
It was just crazy guy and he lost his 

238
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,690
fucking mind and shot a shot him.
Wow.

239
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,170
Yeah.
So yeah,

240
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,480
the whole thing is pretty crazy,
but yeah.

241
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:16,980
Yeah,
yeah.

242
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:21,981
I don't remember the exact guy's name.
I don't remember the story and I don't 

243
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:22,320
feel like googling it right now.
If you want to google it,

244
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,520
look up Dave Schultz murderer.
But I mean that was a great card from 

245
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:31,230
the beginning.
I didn't see the prelims,

246
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:36,231
but I mean,
Mark Scholz in the UFC way back in the 

247
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:36,231
day.
Remember he fought a Gary Goodrich?

248
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:36,260
Yup.

249
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,700
Wasn't it his brother that died and his 
brothers and his brother got shot?

250
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,670
Sat.
There were,

251
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,580
there were monsters.
Monster wrestlers.

252
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,500
Oh,
you cleaned the Olympics?

253
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,020
Amateur Wrestler?
Yeah.

254
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:50,890
Yeah.

255
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,980
Does it say he won the gold in 1984?
Does it say

256
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,820
who murdered him?
Uh,

257
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,150
with some crazy dude.
You used to want to just wrestle dudes.

258
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,160
He like hired these guys to come and 
wrestle him.

259
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,610
I don't know if it was some gang stuff 
or what.

260
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,550
I mean,
you know,

261
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,060
I mean,
look,

262
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,200
there's guys who,
you know,

263
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:13,201
maybe they will know.
It's not like John e Dot d dot 

264
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:15,880
[inaudible] from the part that was the 
guy who killed him was this billionaire 

265
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,390
characters.
He slipped a bunch of paint.

266
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,420
I'm not saying that the rest was gay,
but I'm saying if some guy who was a gay

267
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:21,720
guy just wants to wrestle,
just meet up.

268
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,410
I'll tell you how many rich gay dudes 
are there.

269
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,320
A fly people in to teach them some 
Jujitsu privates.

270
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,210
I think for a lot of gay dudes,
it's the same game as for a lot of 

271
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,511
dudes,
they're looking to turn somebody that 

272
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:39,550
hasn't been a good somebody's wife to 
suck their Dick.

273
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,360
They're looking to get some dude who's 
not gay to let them fuck them.

274
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,620
You know?
It's beautiful.

275
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:48,140
It feels beautiful.
Turned somebody want,

276
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:51,580
they want to get some guys like,
I don't think I could ever be gay too.

277
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,610
Is that the ultimate Mrs Rogan.
So gay friends,

278
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,890
they love straight guys.
They have a thing for straight guys.

279
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:03,220
They want to turn straight guys and you 
know there was a guy that was working in

280
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,310
one of the shows I used to work on who's
working behind the scenes and he was a 

281
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,041
gay dude who would tell me how many 
straight guys who would get drunk and 

282
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:11,220
let them suck their Dick.
Wow.

283
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,580
He said,
he goes,

284
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:14,710
you'd be fucking surprised,
honey.

285
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,750
You'd be fucking surprised.

286
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,970
Excel.
Many of these straight guys that I met 

287
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,281
at a gay bar,
they're acting straight and that's what 

288
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:27,861
it is that I met at a gay bar that we're
acting straight because I haven't come 

289
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:31,071
out of the closet yet.
There's probably a lot of guys that are 

290
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:31,071
straight,
you know that hang out in that.

291
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,280
Fuck.
These guys think it's that

292
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:37,310
or do you think there are some straight 
guys who are just so silly that might 

293
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,370
suck a dick once now?
I don't think so.

294
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,640
I think if you want to suck a Dick,
you,

295
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,270
you,
you're,

296
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:45,180
you're gay dudes who don't have any 
friends.

297
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,120
That's like your bisexual joke.
There's no such thing as bisexual estate

298
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,400
talk here.
I think there's dudes that are just 

299
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:53,490
really fucking dumb and you can talk 
them into blowing you.

300
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,450
I really do believe that.
You could talk a guy at the second.

301
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,130
You'd think there's some dumb dudes out 
there.

302
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:04,131
Dude,
there's some real real dummies out 

303
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:06,861
there.
There's some people out there that will 

304
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:06,861
basically do anything you want them to.
You just have to talk enough to them.

305
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,880
Eventually they'll suck your Dick.
That sister.

306
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,230
That's a good reality show to get the 
guy to pick is going to suck your Dick 

307
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:17,120
and then tell him to fuck himself at the
end of the night.

308
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,950
Like,
let the guy do the whole thing.

309
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,250
You'd have to get close.
You don't have to like be kissing.

310
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,040
No.
Let them see how strong his game is.

311
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,910
So you have your jimmies that deep.
You know what I'm saying?

312
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,980
Come get me.
Take me out.

313
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:32,981
Why me and diabetes get them out to.
It's basically a blue balls gang show 

314
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,110
for those of the host comes out and 
says,

315
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:37,790
so what do you think?
Suck your Dick.

316
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,170
Not that night,
Johnny.

317
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,580
I'm going for the couch and the trip to 
the Bahamas.

318
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,670
Fucking I'm taking second place.
I'm like,

319
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,440
tail salad.
I took the silver.

320
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:50,370
You know what I'm saying?
Fuck that shit.

321
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,910
A little more.
Get hit by a few cds.

322
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,340
Then at the end of that,
I could pull you aside.

323
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:58,250
What do you think it even happened?
I just had the night off.

324
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:03,251
What the fuck the game would be that the
gay guy doesn't realize that if he can 

325
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:07,900
talk a straight guy into it,
he gets like a boss who asshole.

326
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,990
They tripped.
They give him a plaque,

327
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,650
you know?
Give him the fucking world.

328
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,100
A whole wolf run trip of Santa Monica.
The whole thing.

329
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,370
Oh my God.
And he don't know like you gotta say,

330
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,440
Bro,
I got a straight friends.

331
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,480
I think he's gay.
I want you to take them out and just 

332
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:25,480
fucking,
oh my God.

333
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,110
His head or he'll greases hair or shave 
his balls.

334
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:32,111
The whole thing,
he's going there with the intention of 

335
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:34,511
fucking a virgin.
We all get hot when we fucked over the 

336
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:34,511
first time.
You fucked the virgin.

337
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:36,370
How happy were you on the way home?
I don't think I've ever fucked over.

338
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,400
Even if it was a horrible experience.
I never got a virgin come on time.

339
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,690
I got a virgin was when I got divert.
Denies and that was it.

340
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,450
That's it.
You got to be virgin.

341
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:50,590
I have many in high school.
The ugliest dude in the room and I got 

342
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:50,590
like 10 grand.
I got a girl one time.

343
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,700
I stuck my Dick in a divergent it.
Then I went to eat.

344
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,850
I didn't know and I came up with like a 
little red fucking thing on my mind.

345
00:15:55,851 --> 00:16:00,851
It was disgusting.
Could you imagine if you had to deal 

346
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:01,040
with the kind of shit that you had to 
deal with,

347
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,680
the drama that you have to deal with 
when you were like 14 and 15?

348
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,230
Could you imagine you have to go back 
and do that today.

349
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,810
You fit right in.

350
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,840
You didn't have to change your clothes 
already do it.

351
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,370
You just slide right into it.
I dated Peter Pan.

352
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,420
Parents hated spics needed fucking specs
and they get mad at you.

353
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,100
Oh,
they would say right in front of me,

354
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:27,101
but the chicken was so hot.
I didn't give a fuck all you want the 

355
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:31,510
way out the door.
I would just knock on the door and 

356
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:31,510
they'd open the door and just walk away 
from me.

357
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,510
Oh my.
Then she'll come up and then she'd go,

358
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,340
fuck you mom or whatever.
Shut up mom.

359
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,900
But one night I'm at her porch in the 
shit,

360
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,940
like 10 minutes and all of a sudden I 
turned around.

361
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,960
The father was right.
There was like red in the face.

362
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,350
I just took my hand out of those pair of
jeans and I just fucking went.

363
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:50,460
I never called her again.
Nothing.

364
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,060
I seen him like years later,
her brother hated me.

365
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:55,750
He was a fireman,
but they couldn't do dick to me.

366
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,450
You know what I'm saying?

367
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,790
Oh my God.
You ever get caught bone in your 

368
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,830
girlfriends when you're a teenager and 
your parents come home or her parents 

369
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:06,830
come home and you have to jump in the 
closet naked.

370
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,650
It didn't have to jump in the closet 
naked,

371
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:10,030
but I got busted.
I did.

372
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:11,950
I jumped in the closet naked.
It was her house.

373
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:13,970
Her Dad showed up.
Our Dad shot.

374
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,610
I jumped the cloth.
I'm naked.

375
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,710
I was so fucking terrified on the condom
was just on and shit and she stayed.

376
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,000
She stayed for hours.
I passed fucking out the closet.

377
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,960
If you were snoring in the closet,
that's how they caught you.

378
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,210
The cost and there you are naked with a 
condom on.

379
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,660
Condom was stuck in my leg.
Motherfucker is in the closet and he can

380
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:42,261
just go to sleep,
feel so comfortable in the closet with a

381
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,040
condom on and he got busted.

382
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:50,130
Fucking my daughter and he's just 
sleeping for this young man.

383
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,130
This is.
How is it?

384
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,320
That would be.
That might be the worst way to meet 

385
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,820
your.
Your girlfriend's dad if he wakes you up

386
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:03,350
because you're snoring because you're 
naked in the closet with a condom on.

387
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,690
I have a friend,
I have a friend who just got arrested 

388
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,270
because he found his 15 year old 
daughter and her boyfriend having sex in

389
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:14,290
the garage and he beat the fuck out of 
the go.

390
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,930
You told me about that.
Yeah.

391
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,450
You told him that I know a guy.
He's a friend.

392
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,280
Hey man,
it's kids are kids are going to do it.

393
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:28,281
Kids are gonna do man.
Would you be so you think you could have

394
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:31,650
sympathy on a guy like that.
His daughter's getting banged.

395
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:36,730
The real thing,
the real problem with men and women is 

396
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,141
that a lot of kids grow up in an 
environment with their mother and their 

397
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:39,141
father don't get along and they,
they're,

398
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:41,790
they're volatile and there's a lot of 
fighting and yelling and so that's their

399
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,070
model of what a relationship should be 
light.

400
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,660
And if you grow up in a happy household 
and everybody's cool and everybody,

401
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:53,661
you know,
everybody's like friendly with each 

402
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:53,661
other and that's what you associate with
human behavior with.

403
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:55,500
Then that's the type of person you want 
with your daughter.

404
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,240
That's the type of girl you want with 
your son.

405
00:18:57,241 --> 00:19:02,241
You don't want no crazy shit,
but the problem is that most people 

406
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:02,580
aren't like that.
Most people a fucking wreck,

407
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,850
so the real problem with some kid coming
over and wanting to finger banged your 

408
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:08,860
daughter,
isn't that your daughter shouldn't enjoy

409
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:10,260
a good finger banging.
I said,

410
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:13,470
this kid might be a fucking creep.
That's what you have to worry about.

411
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,250
What people have to worry about is how 
other people are raising their kids.

412
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,750
You have to worry.
You have to worry.

413
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:21,230
There's a lot of people out there that 
are completely ignoring their kids.

414
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,250
That guy,
before he beat that get up,

415
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:28,251
you should have stopped him and said,
what kind of a house full of abuse 

416
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,371
fucked up.
You don't want some kid growing up in a 

417
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:31,371
house full of abuse finger and your 
daughters.

418
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:31,620
That's normal.
That's a normal reaction,

419
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:36,621
right?
All of a sudden you walk in on your 

420
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:37,580
daughter have done.
It's not normal and hold them up.

421
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,930
If you look at your daughter wanted to 
do it,

422
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:43,250
if she wanted to do it and he wanted to 
do it is absolutely not right that you'd

423
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:43,890
be,
oh no,

424
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,760
there's no way.
No Way.

425
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:45,720
You have to say,
Hey,

426
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,370
listen,
this is irresponsible.

427
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,910
You guys could get pregnant.
You have to be wearing protection.

428
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,100
You shouldn't be doing this so young,
you know,

429
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:58,101
but look,
you can't do it like this and you can't 

430
00:19:58,101 --> 00:19:58,101
do it so stupid where you get caught in 
the garage.

431
00:19:58,101 --> 00:19:59,520
Is this consensual?
Is Everybody happy?

432
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,200
That's what the conversation you have to
have.

433
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,100
If the girl was crying and say,
look,

434
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:05,960
you know,
this is a,

435
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,590
you know,
this is an embarrassing thing.

436
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:08,800
You fucked up.
Learn from this,

437
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,780
this absolutely correct.
You can't beat the kid up because that's

438
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:13,410
you,
man.

439
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:17,450
It's a kid too.
You got to remember that's a big manner,

440
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,360
so why to beat him up?
His brain's not big.

441
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,120
He's just fucking.
It's what you want to do all the time.

442
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:25,560
It's what everybody wants to do.
Hey,

443
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,580
let me tell you something guys.
When it comes to daughters or wives,

444
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,730
it's all fucking different.
We're not in that room,

445
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,480
so wipe the slate right now when it 
comes to the daughters and wives.

446
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,130
It's a whole different animal,
gentlemen.

447
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,860
So relaxed with that shit.
You know what I'm saying isn't wise?

448
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,890
It's a duplicate shotgun,
but you should look if the guy's hurting

449
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,990
her.
If he's hurting your daughter,

450
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:51,790
that's one thing,
but if your daughter's liking it,

451
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,770
your daughter shouldn't be able to like 
sex.

452
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,150
No,
no.

453
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,440
That's ridiculous.
I know what you're saying is right.

454
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,230
When the animal instincts take over and 
talk to real animal instincts,

455
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:04,240
those should be about disrespect.
Okay.

456
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:07,180
Check this out.
Disrespect about disrespect.

457
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,420
If you were the 15 year old kid and you 
got caught banging his daughter and he 

458
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,780
walked in,
would you be terrified?

459
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,960
Of course,
because of movies,

460
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,870
because the movies,
because guys have no.

461
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:26,930
No.
Because of natural instincts of born.

462
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,300
Thinking that the whole time from when 
you're a kid.

463
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,480
Don't think it's a thinking thing,
bro.

464
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:34,210
I think that's an animal thing.
I think that's what I'm saying.

465
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,970
What I'm saying.
You're born thinking that takes over

466
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:44,140
sometimes.
That's why men have such a huge problem 

467
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,140
with men like grown men having sex with 
like 14,

468
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:49,141
13,
12 year olds because those are like 

469
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:49,141
little kids,
you know,

470
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:49,510
and when grown men want to fuck little 
girls like that.

471
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:54,511
That's.
That is one of the most disturbing 

472
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:54,610
things in one of the things that that's 
the least acceptable.

473
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,640
Least,
you know the least likely to be 

474
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,551
forgiven.
You might be ruining my fucking 

475
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:02,551
daughter's life right here.
That's what that is like.

476
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:03,940
You fuck everything?
Not Forever.

477
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,770
You're probably going to get a pregnant.
I'm gonna kill you.

478
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:10,771
All the work I've done and now you're 
fucking it up and you don't even love 

479
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:11,140
her.
You'll probably tricked her situations.

480
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:13,210
You've been with us for two years.
The father walks in,

481
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,250
he likes you.
Do you ever have sex?

482
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:20,251
I mean,
after six months you figured that 

483
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:20,251
they're having sex but in the garage a 
total different guys.

484
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:24,990
And that's why we're with daughters and 
wise men and I wouldn't beat the fuck 

485
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,210
out of the cake because I'd be a 
hypocrite.

486
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,130
I and hate behind the high school.
I remember one time I even dug into snow

487
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,480
and Dick and I wasn't a fuck this 
chicken,

488
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:36,481
there's snow.
I'd got a little hot behind the fire 

489
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,581
department in the fucking stopped the 
night before I was fingering her little 

490
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,340
monthly and the next day I like 12 feet 
of snow.

491
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:45,340
That wasn't going to stop mad flavor.
When you're full of testosterone,

492
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:46,880
you're 14.
I called it.

493
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,480
The thing about kids,
they accelerate,

494
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,980
they kick it to the next level,
finger in one day,

495
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:53,720
the next day,
the daytime with a shovel shovel,

496
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:58,721
the little patch.
We were partying the night before and I 

497
00:22:58,721 --> 00:22:58,721
thought I was actually going to fuck 
her.

498
00:22:58,721 --> 00:23:00,340
I was even happier because I was going 
to have my whole sexual igloo.

499
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,700
You know what I'm saying?
I'm going to have a sex Eglu Alaska 

500
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,320
motherfucker.
I swear to God.

501
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,400
You know what testosterone takes all,
but that's not the situation at hand.

502
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,830
It's been having a parent that I would 
beat up a kid.

503
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,930
I think I said,
get the fuck out my house.

504
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,020
Yeah.
Would you would definitely be very,

505
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,660
very quick on the draw.
If he was disrespectful,

506
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,680
he started being an addict to you.
You might be a little hyper aggressive.

507
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,660
You Bank your natural instincts is going
to be.

508
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,700
It's hard to ignore your natural 
instincts.

509
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,860
Going to be to beat the fuck out of him.
When I was a kid,

510
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:35,770
I did a lot of young girls and that was 
the only parent.

511
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,140
They were German,
German people,

512
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,560
you know.
They were the only ones that were ever 

513
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:43,560
rude to me.
The only ones,

514
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,400
the only panel,
whatever that route to me.

515
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,560
Really?
Yeah,

516
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:46,340
like the only.

517
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,560
Think about this.
How would you react?

518
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,740
Your daughter's dating some dude.
You met him a couple times.

519
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,230
He's totally disrespectful.
He has no respect for you.

520
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,380
You don't like this motherfucking dude.
You don't want them to be together and 

521
00:23:59,380 --> 00:23:59,810
you hate this motherfucking kid.
He's a Dick.

522
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:00,890
He's a Douche.
She thinks he's.

523
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,920
He's arrogant and then two weeks later 
you catch him banging.

524
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,250
You walk in the garage and he's banging 
your daughter right now.

525
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,710
You just have a stern talk with them.
You have to realize that you got to put 

526
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,210
them to sleep.
Well.

527
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:17,010
You've got to stop this know if your 
daughter marks.

528
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:21,080
I've never got hurt.
Never threatened.

529
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,760
Harm against a kid.
Used to choking people out,

530
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,200
but he wakes up.
She's dressed in God if she's putting.

531
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,290
Yeah,
but she's not getting raped.

532
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,030
She's liking it.
Exactly.

533
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,560
Where you did you not have sex when 
you're a 15 year old boy?

534
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:38,820
I was 13.
13.

535
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,880
I was 13.
All right,

536
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,780
so in your head though.
Okay.

537
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,970
I was a fucking elicit.
I didn't want to do it though.

538
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:45,320
I didn't want.
I got talked into it.

539
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,910
If you want the girl to be happy,

540
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,640
you should want her to like boys wanting
to be around nice boys and have fun with

541
00:24:50,641 --> 00:24:51,840
your body.
You know,

542
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,380
responsibly.
That's what you should be doing.

543
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,360
Shouldn't be beating the fuck out of 
some kid that's banging your daughter.

544
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:57,990
That's crazy.

545
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,830
Yeah.
I could easily talk to.

546
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,380
I'm gonna.
Look,

547
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:04,480
this is the last time you allowed here.
I don't care.

548
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:06,250
You know what you guys do out of my 
house,

549
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:07,960
but you can't be here if you hate them 
that bad.

550
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,570
You have to do something.
You don't just fucking start choking the

551
00:25:10,571 --> 00:25:15,571
guy out and now you're in jail.
I think jo jo Jo's got a really good 

552
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:22,721
good,
get the fucker out and three seconds to 

553
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,400
read his daughter for a little bit.
By the time he wakes up,

554
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:29,401
he'll be dressed.
You drag them out of the wake up in the 

555
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:31,000
fucking all backwards.

556
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,480
That's what I think Joe's going to do.
Best case scenario is you find some kid 

557
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,671
who likes your daughter and you like 
them and he's like a cool guy and you 

558
00:25:41,671 --> 00:25:43,420
become friends with them.
That's the best case scenario.

559
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,180
You know some dude who's,
who's dating your daughter,

560
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:48,130
who you actually like when he comes 
over,

561
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,750
you know,
like he's your friend.

562
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:51,370
Now he's dating your daughter,
but you're like,

563
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,460
you could fuck her and stuff like that.

564
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,400
She's going to want you to fuck her.
She's,

565
00:25:55,410 --> 00:26:00,410
uh,
she's going to want you to imagine dude 

566
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:00,410
hooks it up.
Dude.

567
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:00,410
Hooks it up,
tries to convince the daughter,

568
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,890
pays for the hotel,
pays for the hotels,

569
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,010
the guy.
I'm telling you,

570
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,290
that's the easiest.
Which

571
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,080
way to turn your daughter into a lesbian
ever.

572
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,380
Could you imagine they would just go 
straight laszlo.

573
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:16,490
That's their deal.
That's probably how lesbians are 

574
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:16,490
created.
When it's not natural,

575
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,651
that's probably how you create them.
You get the father to get you to try to 

576
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:21,680
fuck his friends.
That's probably formula.

577
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:26,820
That's the best way to have a woman.
Completely distrust men for the rest of 

578
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,820
her life.
Just get.

579
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,250
Get your daughter to fuck your friends.
Get your daughter.

580
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,480
Fuck your friend.
Right?

581
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,230
She's just going to try to rebel.
How's she going to rebel?

582
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:36,040
It's going to go.
Let's go.

583
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,950
That's the only move.
If you've got to check my father in law,

584
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:41,410
that's pretty fucking cool.
I had a great father in law.

585
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,740
He's the one that bailed me out of jail 
the first time.

586
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:46,830
We were like shaky when I got in 
trouble.

587
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,380
Then all of a sudden he was definitely.

588
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,520
There was a weird relationship because 
he had boys,

589
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,940
but he was kind of upset how his boys 
had turned that they turned into 

590
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:55,940
pussies,
right?

591
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,510
Will.
He wanted them to be very educated.

592
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,360
They didn't want to do that,
so he was kind of upset with them.

593
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,650
In a way.
He doesn't understand,

594
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:03,060
you know,
that I think you told me this,

595
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,750
so yeah,
yeah.

596
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:05,520
He was very upset with them and they 
were successful.

597
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,860
This roofing company,
you know,

598
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:10,480
to read different states,
but he just wasn't into that stuff.

599
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,440
So we're always going to be weird when 
someone's fucking your baby,

600
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,560
you know,
all my relationships in high school when

601
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:21,561
I was dating a girl and you know,
as soon as the parents knew or bone and 

602
00:27:21,561 --> 00:27:21,990
it was always creepy,
he'd be around them like you're stealing

603
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:23,360
food from them,
you know,

604
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,280
it's like just filled.

605
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,480
I had my parents walk in and my dad 
walked in and my step mom walk into was 

606
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,520
having sex when I was like 17 and the 
step mom got pissed.

607
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:33,590
But the data is like,
man,

608
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,390
it's pretty cool.
Yeah.

609
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,910
My mom

610
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,130
used to like fucking try to set ground 
rules and shit.

611
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:43,131
Like she couldn't,
she couldn't come over my house and be 

612
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:43,131
in my bedroom with the door closed.

613
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:45,050
All right mom,
just get the fuck outta here.

614
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:46,470
All right.
This other girl,

615
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:52,190
this other girl I dated,
her parents let me spend the night when 

616
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,091
I was 16 sleep in bed.
She would wake up the next morning time 

617
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:58,751
to wake up school bus or whatever time 
to wake up to go to school and I just 

618
00:27:58,751 --> 00:28:01,870
remember looking up and seeing her dad 
and I never thought it was crazy and my 

619
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,460
parents knew I would stay tonight,
but now I look back at it.

620
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:03,680
I'm like,
that's fucking weird.

621
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,230
The only time it happened to me,
I was 21.

622
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:08,930
She was 17,
was my girlfriend for about three years.

623
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,810
She.
She was 17 million.

624
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,110
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

625
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,140
18 right now,
but we didn't have sex at 17 when she 

626
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,140
was 17.
When she turned 18,

627
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,160
that's when the SEC started.
It was just like a month later.

628
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:24,270
You're not under Clinton definitions so 
that when you're just pen pals before 

629
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:24,270
you know.

630
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:29,110
I didn't even think about that.
I didn't even think about 21 slash 17.

631
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:34,340
That didn't even enter my mind at all at
our parents were totally cool with it.

632
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,470
She,
their parents let me spend the night.

633
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,860
They were totally cool in the,
unless you're an Iowa where you're now 

634
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,651
allowed to be 16 to be a stripper,
but the only law is you have to come 

635
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:45,230
home before 11:00
PM.

636
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,540
How?
That's incredible.

637
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,860
What state?
Uh,

638
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,010
Iowa and I think also Rhode Island.
Is that what I said last time?

639
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:57,050
You think you got the two to 10,
15 shift.

640
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:02,300
It's the,
you gotta push that law through someone 

641
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,701
fucking 16 year old to see the process 
of that reality show on the birth of 

642
00:29:10,401 --> 00:29:10,940
that.
Fuck.

643
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:15,800
That's got to be some people from the 
ghetto boys.

644
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:19,510
He pushed it to the seller.
Hey,

645
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,720
I never found out.
Remember that Shit.

646
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,160
No one covered.
Whereas eyeballs falling out.

647
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,670
Was that real?
Or if that was a real shot himself.

648
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,360
I heard it was real,
but I don't know if that was fake.

649
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,330
Real dude.
That guy was off the deep end.

650
00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:37,331
Crazy.
There'd never been a guy like Bushwick 

651
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:37,331
bill.
That was crazy pitcher,

652
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:40,471
man.
It's a midget star rapper who with one 

653
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:42,150
guy who shot himself who was fucked up 
and all of drugs and still

654
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,690
is a giant star.
Wow.

655
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,730
What kind of pushing you to that guy?
He must've gotten dad.

656
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:52,110
Bill is probably the.
I'm the Michael Jordan of black bitches.

657
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,220
You know what I mean?
He knows the most painless.

658
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,280
The only other guy is von Troyer.
That guy.

659
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:04,910
I'm sure midgets around the world have 
posters of Vernon troyer and fucking the

660
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,050
street midgets for sure.
Bushwick.

661
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:10,210
Bill is the number one dude in their 
soul.

662
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:11,650
That's that Bruce Lee.
Hey Dude,

663
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,870
I'm fine.
Fine.

664
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,930
Cold War.
Wait,

665
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:15,370
wait.
By the Geto boys.

666
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,980
This is the best geto boys.
So hold on.

667
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:17,180
No,
no,

668
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:17,400
no,
no.

669
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:18,690
Fuck award.
Find that.

670
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:22,100
Please find fuck a war.
But this is shows you bushwick.

671
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,600
Bill could fucking flow too though.
You know,

672
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,670
he had a weird way of talking,
you know,

673
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:30,360
you know,
but his boys were good.

674
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,120
It was fucking talented.
I don't know what he was mad,

675
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,260
but he was talented.

676
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,850
He rose midgetry totally transcended all
that.

677
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,690
He got hoes.
Everybody respected him as a rapper.

678
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:48,780
He was a fucking rock star mission.
This is a great song.

679
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,320
Hmm.
Hmm.

680
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,680
What is this?
No Shit.

681
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:47,550
Okay.
Okay.

682
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,420
Let me play.
Fortunately for him,

683
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,280
he doesn't have to be all that fucking 
mad.

684
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:25,150
They'll never draft a midget like he was
all pissed off.

685
00:33:25,151 --> 00:33:29,050
Like then we're going to pick him like 
he was going to be like,

686
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,640
you really felt that angry.
I liked that.

687
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:37,290
My favorite song.
It feels good to be a gangster.

688
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,940
That scarface,
that whole song was Bushwick.

689
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:42,350
Bill,
scarface,

690
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,840
scarface,
scarface.

691
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,930
It's a different guy singing yet.
But that was my get a voice on.

692
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,790
Yeah.
It's a different ghetto boy though.

693
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:57,040
His best song is a fuck a war.
That's his best one,

694
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:57,880
man.
That's the best one.

695
00:33:57,881 --> 00:33:58,810
That's all.
Bushwick.

696
00:33:58,811 --> 00:34:00,850
All flow.
That's a good fucking song.

697
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:07,430
And it's fucking right.
And then there's that little wee man.

698
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,280
Day.
Jackass.

699
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,610
Skater dude.
The comedian that a little kiss.

700
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,340
What does the Dude's name?
Ms Dot Daly's friends.

701
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:22,880
What was it about the spot right now 
though?

702
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,580
You what I'm saying?
Do you know his name?

703
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,430
Brad.
Brad.

704
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,230
Brad.
Brad.

705
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Brad.
He's imagined with Coleman considered 

706
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,240
images.
You funny.

707
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,890
It's people just want to hear these nice
kid.

708
00:34:32,891 --> 00:34:33,940
He's a nice kid.
He's really.

709
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,900
Gary Coleman wasn't considered a midget.
Oh yeah,

710
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:36,820
no,
no,

711
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,110
no,
but his head was small.

712
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,630
He was different.
He was like a little person,

713
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Gary Coleman.
He wasn't like a real midget dwarf 

714
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:46,500
summer mentioned,
so you know,

715
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,550
it'd be awesome if they remade with 
story of Gary Coleman,

716
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:50,500
but they used webster to play Gary 
Coleman,

717
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,940
that guy,
that photo of him in bed dying and his 

718
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,770
wife taking a picture.
She's right next to him taking a photo.

719
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:01,710
That is one of the creepiest photos I've
ever seen in my life.

720
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,630
Which photo can I say?
There's a woman.

721
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,590
I think I saved it.
I saved it here.

722
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,470
Hopefully I did,
but it's Gary Coleman and he's in his.

723
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,150
On his deathbed.
You see if you can find a brian.

724
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,360
All right.
Here.

725
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:19,190
I'm going to look for it on Google.
Joey,

726
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,050
what's the story though?
You teach today?

727
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,070
Tonight.
Tonight.

728
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,660
What's the curriculum this week?
What's that?

729
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,340
What the fuck are we doing?
We're doing the ham sandwich.

730
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,660
Okay.
Awesome.

731
00:35:36,661 --> 00:35:41,661
Half guard and we're also doing.
I'm old school from quarter guard and a 

732
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:50,330
writer and north South chokers.
She took a picture of herself.

733
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,890
It's all watermarked.
All over it.

734
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,070
You can find if you just google Gary 
Coleman death photo,

735
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:01,130
it's him all fucked up,
lying in bed and she's taking a picture 

736
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,250
just like totally coldly just into the.

737
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,890
Is this the.
That's what I'm getting from her.

738
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,540
She just wants to get a photo of herself
next to this freak next to this family.

739
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:10,710
That's his wife.
Famous thing.

740
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:15,450
It is his wife and his wife.
She's fucking selling photos of her next

741
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:20,451
to the dead body or dying body.
He looks like a baby baby.

742
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,890
Damn.
He got a big white girl.

743
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,680
God Damn.
So that was his wife for sure.

744
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,300
Yes.
Oh Shit.

745
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:27,680
Yeah.
He.

746
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,590
Well,
he divorced her,

747
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:32,250
but she still had a some power to sam I 
guess.

748
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,530
I don't know.
Poor fog.

749
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,880
I don't know what he did in a past life,
if you believe in that.

750
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,140
He did some shit.

751
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,390
Well,
I already was like an asshole too.

752
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,750
I already was probably so hard to not be
when you're three feet tall and 

753
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:47,750
everybody's fucking with you everywhere 
you go,

754
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,750
you know

755
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,870
going dynamite.
And he's like,

756
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,550
that's not,
that's not my thing.

757
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,640
Oh,
that's right.

758
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:02,580
I'm sorry.
What you talking about Willis must have.

759
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,610
Oh,
you're not the guy from good times.

760
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,700
Good Times.
Good Times.

761
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:11,640
I so thought that was you.
I seen her to the audition with the.

762
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,790
Yeah,
the,

763
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:13,740
the only thing.
Good.

764
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,770
No more know.
She's older.

765
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,100
She had 60,
70 or something.

766
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,330
She shouldn't be on the show.
I was reading something about,

767
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,830
you remember that band live and other 
live.

768
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:30,370
There was a,
an article that I was reading about how 

769
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,340
they broke up and about how the singer 
wanted all the money.

770
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:36,341
He wanted them to sign off all the 
rights to the songs and everything to 

771
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:39,941
him.
I don't know who was right or who was 

772
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:41,471
wrong,
but I was looking at that and I was 

773
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:42,230
like,
how fucking hard is it to make it in the

774
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:45,770
music business?
Is that the hardest thing in all of show

775
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:47,270
business?
I think it is,

776
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,340
right?
You think that's the hardest thing?

777
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,180
It's the hardest thing because,
uh,

778
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,050
yeah,
I guess maybe,

779
00:37:56,051 --> 00:37:57,960
I mean acting is kind of hard to,
you know,

780
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,380
sometimes it just depends on how good 
you are.

781
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:05,450
It's a good product.
If you have persistence and you keep 

782
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,721
pushing if you have this,
but some people will never get the good 

783
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:09,721
product.
You know,

784
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:10,640
Comedians,
songwriter.

785
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Look at Mike Posner.
He started off doing like itunes or 

786
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,420
garage band,
shit in the giving a cdna and now he's 

787
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,430
got one of the number one cds out right 
now in that no idea who that is.

788
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,370
He's the one that's seeing Mike Posner.
Is it?

789
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,020
Is he good?
I like them.

790
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,490
Oh,
you want to hear?

791
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,670
Once you hear the song,
you'll see.

792
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,960
You know what?
I'm going to stab you with a pen.

793
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,780
I want to stop.
You have a pen.

794
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,920
Cock sucker you think is good music.

795
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,070
All right.
This is to laugh a fax with a Banjo.

796
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,700
It's very tough.
You know,

797
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,170
you see these bands that break up the 
two fucking up.

798
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,370
So there was like,
yeah,

799
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,540
you know them.
Them getting along with each other.

800
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,500
It's impossible.

801
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,070
Whoa,
Whoa,

802
00:38:52,071 --> 00:38:52,520
Whoa,
Whoa,

803
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:53,900
super loud.

804
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,970
What is this?
Mike Posner,

805
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:06,960
he's the one that he was going to 
college up to like three months ago.

806
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,370
Now.
He is like the number one CD.

807
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:13,610
He was just found online pretty much.
This is the number one album.

808
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:19,870
It just came out yesterday.
The aliens are landing cocksucker 

809
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,990
fucking garbage.
Fuck.

810
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
The world is coming through.
You don't want to judge this song 

811
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,530
harshly because maybe I would like it 
under other circumstances.

812
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:33,810
I've heard it before.
Is it the guy with the big hoop 

813
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:34,890
earrings?
I don't think so.

814
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:39,891
Now here's the thing about songs by if 
someone tells you this is the best song 

815
00:39:39,891 --> 00:39:39,891
ever,
never heard of it,

816
00:39:39,891 --> 00:39:43,611
and then they play it.
If it doesn't grab you in like 15 

817
00:39:43,611 --> 00:39:43,611
seconds.
What this is,

818
00:39:43,611 --> 00:39:45,510
this is like.
I've heard that we used to use it on the

819
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:47,180
desk squad a couple of years ago.
Yes.

820
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,020
Oh,
that's a couple of years old.

821
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,650
Is that?
Yeah.

822
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:51,480
This song,
this song has been redone,

823
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:56,481
like just support this new album that 
came out because they buy some rapper 

824
00:39:56,481 --> 00:39:58,860
found them and they made him Redo all 
the songs and so there's like old school

825
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:03,861
versions he used to do like on garage 
band in his dorm room at this song and 

826
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:04,050
now this song is like one of the number 
one songs.

827
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,450
It's crazy,
like it's really interesting.

828
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:11,451
He liked his.
His story is really interesting and he 

829
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,781
just has discovered on my space,
I think just office website and word of 

830
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:18,441
mouth and he said throw free songs up on
torrents and on his website and cds and 

831
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,040
it just became big.
It's crazy.

832
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,080
I can get into.

833
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,570
That's a good story.
I like that.

834
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:29,910
Sorry.
There's a band called M I l l and the 

835
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,110
song's called chasing shadows.
Change.

836
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,710
Listen to this for for 20 seconds.
What's it called?

837
00:40:36,711 --> 00:40:41,280
It chasing shadows by ill.
I got super crazy baked on the vaporizer

838
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:44,280
yesterday at a buddy of mine and he 
goes,

839
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:45,750
check out this song.
It's just,

840
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,800
I don't know.
You're either going to love it or hate 

841
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:51,800
it,
but it fucking blew me away.

842
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,440
It's like music you've never heard 
before.

843
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:55,510
Like super coming out of the closet.
Radio.

844
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,340
It's band

845
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,740
chasing shadows.
Is this it?

846
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,640
Is it chasing shadows?
Already went really high,

847
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:09,450
son.
Hold on.

848
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,760
I feel like I should go put on my elf 
costume.

849
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,560
Maybe I should dress up like a wizard to
the beach.

850
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:25,580
Chosen.
There's no vocals or nothing.

851
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,330
It's just all instrumental.
That's just a really.

852
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,280
Yeah.
It's just all a do dish,

853
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,760
freestyle and on electric electronic 
shit and it's like playing all these 

854
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,091
different gadgets and the like that it's
called a dubstep supposedly like huge 

855
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:50,060
and clubs.
I love listening to music with no lyrics

856
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:55,390
for a writing.
It's just chaos.

857
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,690
This is like when Mars attacks.
Yes,

858
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:07,691
exactly.
It's just like the background of a bank 

859
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:11,220
robbery scene.
Yes.

860
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,340
Rich Ob guy.
All right,

861
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,870
let's kill this.
I want you to do.

862
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,920
I can respect that.
It's like boom.

863
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,120
My fucking happened to classic video on 
these fucking people.

864
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:28,930
Less time I was here.
I saw you talking.

865
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,650
Yeah.
I'm going to drop another one,

866
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:33,050
but this is my present to Joe Rowe 
because I know he likes to do,

867
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,910
but you gotta plug in your computer.
Okay.

868
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:39,911
What do you want?
You got to just see the first minute of 

869
00:42:39,911 --> 00:42:42,821
his performance and I'm going to show 
watch on my computer because around here

870
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,400
it's not the head.
You've got to see this.

871
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,500
You've got to fucking feel this.
What is it?

872
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:53,550
It's James Brown live in 1974.
During the big payback,

873
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,160
just the first minute 19 for xy.
Yeah.

874
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:02,260
I just.
The first minute he was dead for the 

875
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:02,260
Muhammad Ali fight.
This was the.

876
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,650
The concert from Mohammed Ali when he 
knocked out George Foreman or whatever 

877
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,281
the fuck it was.
I want you to see the first minute of 

878
00:43:09,281 --> 00:43:09,320
this.
This is just for you,

879
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:09,600
Doug.

880
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,400
You're going to fucking die.
I'm gonna die.

881
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,350
You're gonna fucking die.
You're gonna fucking die.

882
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,210
He's not 10 with fucking organs or given
away.

883
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:23,250
He's 50 gentleman who will make your 
bladder's.

884
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,140
Wow.
This man will need

885
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,800
you will welcome the Godfather.

886
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:48,270
He comes out,
get up.

887
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,010
Oh my God.
He's a genius.

888
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:58,450
Holy Shit.

889
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,280
God Damn road bond.
For those who's not,

890
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:32,120
we're not saying that.
It's open chest to his neighbor.

891
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:39,840
This is a classic slice at a time.
This is a classic moment of captured,

892
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,160
captured moment of a crazy time and 
there's no internet.

893
00:44:55,990 --> 00:45:00,990
There's no TMZ,
no CNN.

894
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:19,420
He's got a fucking thing on his belt 
that says f o s Godfather.

895
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,180
Look at that fucking hair styles.
That split catch.

896
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:39,650
That might jump out with miss a fucking 
beat.

897
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,040
He's a master with that thing.
Brown must have.

898
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:52,190
He must have

899
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:56,230
them all.
That is the hardest working man.

900
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:01,350
That was impressive as fuck.
And you look at that.

901
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,580
How many people doing that today?
Huh?

902
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:10,450
Nobody can fuck with that.
That's your heart.

903
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,590
That's what it's all about.
Suck it.

904
00:46:13,591 --> 00:46:17,710
R Kelly,
suck as bad to the bone motherfuckers.

905
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,990
But you gotta give him props.
Are you getting a lover?

906
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,070
I kill.
My favorite black Canadian was sophie.

907
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,110
Went up from James Brown power.
Nobody makes me laugh more than r Kelly.

908
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,540
I've watched.
I've watched every video he's ever made.

909
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,600
I have a whole series.
The trapped in the closet on DVD DVD.

910
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:41,950
So crazy.
It's like a window into madness.

911
00:46:41,951 --> 00:46:46,700
You know Mike,
Bro.

912
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,190
This look,
this right here.

913
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:52,000
This is switch rockstar.
Shut up his mic.

914
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:56,620
There's this new song that people are 
saying it's even worse than r Kelly,

915
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:01,850
like it's been so bad.
If it's a brand new song by soldier boy 

916
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:01,850
called pretty boy.
Pretty boy.

917
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,520
Soldier.
It's fucking.

918
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:08,550
The video.
Looks like it cost 700 bucks and the 

919
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,390
song and the lyrics are fucking 
hysterical.

920
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,500
We were just super bad.
I don't know if it's as bad as our 

921
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,421
county,
our Kelly private crashes and I don't 

922
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:18,421
think that could be a worse on r Kelly 
thinking about r Kelly is.

923
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:23,071
It's not just bad.
It's just so much drama going on and 

924
00:47:23,071 --> 00:47:27,430
choosing me as shit.
I ain't fucking clown clown.

925
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,940
Who's going to be cool is you be cover 
guy,

926
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
like he'd do it.
You're covering it like they do on 

927
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,781
Youtube.
There's all these people that got the 

928
00:47:39,781 --> 00:47:41,251
whole thing down.
There's kids that have you seen these 

929
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:43,090
youtube videos?
I've seen it for other songs,

930
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,750
so that was the most amazing one.
It has no rhyme or reason,

931
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,670
you know,
to be able to memorize that song.

932
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:51,220
It's a feat that's like,
oh,

933
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:53,720
this is pretty boy swag.
Yeah,

934
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,480
it was terrible.
It's one of the worst songs ever,

935
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:03,870
but you know what?
There's so many dumb people out there 

936
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:04,960
and they need stuff too.
They need stuff that appeals to them.

937
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,120
There's people that you play him a good 
song that's complicated and deep.

938
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:10,390
You play a whole lot of love and they're
not going to get it.

939
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:15,420
They're not going to get the song,
but they'll listen to that and like my 

940
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,110
favorite.
They need entertainment too.

941
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:20,770
I like that.

942
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,830
I though that soulja boy.
I love it.

943
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:25,620
You know what man?
He's just having fun.

944
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,730
I liked that.
He's having fun.

945
00:48:26,731 --> 00:48:28,170
I like watching us.
You streamed videos.

946
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,090
He makes use stream videos and any 
parties all the time.

947
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,040
It's fucking like this kid is having a 
blast,

948
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:37,041
man.
He's driving around laughing and joking 

949
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:37,041
and talking about the chicks.
He's banging.

950
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:39,060
I mean he's.
He's wearing giant diamonds and shit.

951
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,920
I think he's having a good time.
I love it.

952
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,170
I liked watches.
USTREAM show.

953
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:47,340
I don't like it.
I like that other song he had to was the

954
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,500
first Song Superman.
Oh yeah,

955
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:51,040
that's a good song.
That was a cool song.

956
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:56,150
That's a good song.
People love that motherfucking song and 

957
00:48:56,311 --> 00:48:57,360
he's young.
He's young too.

958
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,010
It was like 20 years old or something 
like that.

959
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,980
I mean,
how do you expect them to act?

960
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:02,700
This is perfect.

961
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,480
I like what he's doing.
I think he's doing a great job.

962
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,960
Just keeping it friendly.
Reagan Miller videos,

963
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:10,860
very entertaining.
Even though it's low budget,

964
00:49:10,861 --> 00:49:13,410
it's very entertaining to watch them 
dance around.

965
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,440
He's very smart.
He did that thing where he got that at 

966
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:18,440
saint now number.
Oh,

967
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:18,690
I haven't seen now.
Number two.

968
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,960
But he did this thing where he got a 
saint now number and with his st 

969
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,830
outnumber he put it on a song so 
everybody can call him.

970
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,170
My St Number is eight.
One eight,

971
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,740
two,
three,

972
00:49:28,741 --> 00:49:29,520
seven,
four,

973
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:30,140
two,
four,

974
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:35,150
five.
My favorite is listening to your 

975
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:35,150
message.
Okay.

976
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,430
I don't really have anything to say but 
keep it on.

977
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,940
What do you think about UFC 12?
Yeah,

978
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,460
it's strange.
It's strange,

979
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,180
but it's cool because I did it.
I've used it a couple times.

980
00:49:42,181 --> 00:49:44,250
It's like a little conference call,
like I used it.

981
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,040
Um,
uh,

982
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,850
going from the airport to the hotel,
I just call it.

983
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,880
I set it up and then it goes live at 
tweets that I'm going live and then 

984
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,880
people wait in line to talk and you can 
talk to me.

985
00:49:53,881 --> 00:49:55,980
You have your own radio station,
like you're taking collars,

986
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,160
like what's up man?
And so anybody could listen to the call 

987
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,160
listening.
Everyone's listening.

988
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,461
Yeah.
Anyone can listen to the calls and all 

989
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:04,590
the people that are waiting to talk to 
you because it's 100 people waiting.

990
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,390
They're all listening so it's like a 
radio station.

991
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:09,160
It's like a 100 person radio station.
I,

992
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:09,930
I,
I,

993
00:50:09,931 --> 00:50:14,931
you know,
I was like giving people advice and 

994
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:17,811
talking to people about life and joking 
about fights coming up and joking about 

995
00:50:17,811 --> 00:50:18,270
all kinds of different shit.
It's pretty bad ass.

996
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,360
Is it growing?
Is that like as well that,

997
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,280
that soulja boy do it this way.
I brought it up.

998
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:27,350
He,
he got two point 2 million friends on st

999
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,130
out two point

1000
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,040
2 million people following Dan contact.
Anytime he wants,

1001
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:33,770
he can send them all a voicemail.
That's what the same.

1002
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,600
Nothing does.
It alerts you when you get a voicemail.

1003
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,180
So I'll put up a voicemail.
I'll leave a message for everybody,

1004
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:38,750
like,
you know,

1005
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,430
headed to the fights.
Can't wait,

1006
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,350
is going to be fucking crazy,
blah blah blah blah blah.

1007
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:45,290
I'm looking forward to this fight and 
look for that fight and then I send it,

1008
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:48,950
see bitches later and then everybody 
gets a notification and then they can go

1009
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:51,320
listen to it.
You get contacts.

1010
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:55,220
It's even more direct than twitter.
Pretty crazy shit man.

1011
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,720
Because people might miss your shit in 
twitter.

1012
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,850
Like how many people do you follow?
Do you follow a lot of people?

1013
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,130
Uh,
I dunno,

1014
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,250
I follow like 600 people.
I think something silly like that.

1015
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:05,630
Yeah.
Six hundred 76.

1016
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:10,800
I just,
anytime someone says something even 

1017
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,191
remotely interesting,
I'll click follow and I probably 

1018
00:51:12,191 --> 00:51:15,281
shouldn't have said that because now 
people are gonna be asking me to follow 

1019
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:15,281
him.

1020
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:15,281
But um,
when you do that,

1021
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,300
you get this endless stream on your 
homepage.

1022
00:51:17,301 --> 00:51:18,650
You don't,
you can't even keep up with it.

1023
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,450
There's like so many new tweets.
It's,

1024
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:21,500
it's constant.
You know,

1025
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:26,530
you're always getting,
you might lose like cool shit that 

1026
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:26,530
people say,
but if someone sends me one of these,

1027
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:29,450
like you get it.
A lot of people follow a lot of people,

1028
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:31,940
right?
You guys don't follow a lot of people.

1029
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,320
I do.
How many of you fall?

1030
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,700
Uh,
I don't remember,

1031
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:37,280
but I follow a lot,
like 748.

1032
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,220
But I also delete.
I delete a lot of them.

1033
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:44,100
I get annoyed with people super fast.
They tweet too much a tweet too much.

1034
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,760
They do delete Kevin Smith.
Yeah,

1035
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:51,761
I did.
I added him back on recently because he 

1036
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:51,761
doesn't do it as much.
Or you know,

1037
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:56,621
there's this new thing where you can 
choose if you want the at replies are 

1038
00:51:56,621 --> 00:51:56,621
not on each profile.

1039
00:51:56,621 --> 00:51:56,900
Have you seen that?
No.

1040
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,900
Twitter on twitter.
If you use twitter on the website now if

1041
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:04,901
you go to their profile,
there's this little logo you can click 

1042
00:52:04,901 --> 00:52:05,750
on and say show at replies or turn it on
or off.

1043
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:09,590
So his problem was is he was replying to
all these fucking people and it was just

1044
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:14,650
clogging up my twitter.
But now I have this little button I 

1045
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:14,650
pushed and I don't get any of it.
So.

1046
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:17,380
Well I don't mind it when people spam,
let them talk to you.

1047
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:20,150
Like a who?
Whose tweets to enjoy.

1048
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,120
I Love Kevin Smith.
That's why I want one of the reasons why

1049
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:24,180
I brought it up because he,
he,

1050
00:52:24,181 --> 00:52:25,340
uh,
she cut them us.

1051
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,870
Yeah.
And I liked how he talks to people,

1052
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,690
you know,
he said Anthony Kumina from opiod.

1053
00:52:29,691 --> 00:52:30,710
Anthony didn't like.
He's like,

1054
00:52:30,711 --> 00:52:32,240
he's always fucking replying to 
everybody.

1055
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,610
Like he tweets too much,
but I was like,

1056
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:36,110
I don't care.
That doesn't bother me.

1057
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,540
I can look over that.
People are so impatient,

1058
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,160
you know,
can't look over,

1059
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,090
you know,
six,

1060
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:44,990
seven lines of texts and just scroll 
down the annoys you that much.

1061
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,060
Sometimes people end up,
because it's cogs,

1062
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:52,090
his promise he would clog,
it would be the whole page and then you 

1063
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:52,320
have to go to the second page and then 
it's like,

1064
00:52:52,321 --> 00:52:54,170
isn't that hard to do?
It's annoying.

1065
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:54,720
I know.
Why.

1066
00:52:54,721 --> 00:52:55,730
Why?
Why do I want it?

1067
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,090
I mean he's using it like he spam.
Like if that was your email,

1068
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:04,180
you would be like,
why is this guy spamming and does it 

1069
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:04,180
every now and then for like a few 
minutes.

1070
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,100
Does he do it too much?
Slow down,

1071
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,580
slow down.
I had no.

1072
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,620
I'm just saying I agree,
but now it doesn't bother me because you

1073
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:12,170
can turn it off.
So now I follow him,

1074
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:16,180
so that was just my only thing.
Don't get another of his retweets.

1075
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:21,550
None of it.
I want to see all the interaction 

1076
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:21,550
though.
Don't you want to see the interaction?

1077
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:22,850
Yeah,
but I'll go to his page or something.

1078
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:27,851
You know,
part of the fun for me though is 

1079
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:27,851
watching

1080
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:30,980
people interact with people.
So like there's a voyeuristic thing to 

1081
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,681
at all.
I like watching like porn stars talk to 

1082
00:53:33,681 --> 00:53:34,710
each other and celebrities talk to each 
other.

1083
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,510
I like,
I like watching all that shit.

1084
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,600
I'll look into everything.
Marched in just regular normal Weirdos.

1085
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:44,990
Talk about different things.
I watched people getting douchey with 

1086
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:44,990
each other.
It's fascinating.

1087
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:48,570
It's like a little community man.
This fucking podcast,

1088
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:49,950
last energy feel that shit

1089
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:56,230
are doing two days in a row.
We already talked about at the top like,

1090
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,310
oh,
he's doing a podcast that it wasn't him.

1091
00:54:01,311 --> 00:54:03,740
It was a two of his guys,
Dino and Gary.

1092
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,900
They flew when I talked to him for a 
little while.

1093
00:54:05,901 --> 00:54:07,700
I was kind of fun.
I'll see him today time like,

1094
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,420
is this done?
Huh?

1095
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,560
No,
what was good to us guy always,

1096
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:15,160
uh,
always hooked us up always when we,

1097
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:18,380
whenever we needed to promote gigs,
always had us on what was a nice guy.

1098
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,940
Canceled the show.
Well,

1099
00:54:19,941 --> 00:54:21,800
there's the whole radio station switched
formats.

1100
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:23,450
They went,
I don't know what they went with.

1101
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,340
Some hits,
hits top hits,

1102
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:26,560
shit,
you know,

1103
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:28,250
that whole talk radio thing that didn't 
work.

1104
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,490
It didn't work out.
Demos around for like 15 years,

1105
00:54:31,491 --> 00:54:32,340
20 years.
Solid,

1106
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,650
right?
It should've worked out.

1107
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,540
It's the most entertaining thing to 
listen to on the radio.

1108
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:40,541
But people get tired of listening to the
radio and that satellite radio came 

1109
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:41,630
along and so much freedom.
So commercials kill.

1110
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:46,690
You can't fuck with opie and Anthony,
do they have the best comics in the 

1111
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:49,481
fucking country?
They go on all the time and those guys 

1112
00:54:49,481 --> 00:54:49,730
go off.
You're not gonna be able to keep up with

1113
00:54:49,731 --> 00:54:52,160
that some regular morning zoo radio 
station that's wacky.

1114
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:57,161
If you want to listen to something funny
in the morning and you have the option 

1115
00:54:57,161 --> 00:54:59,000
of opie and anthony or you know some 
morning fucking nonsense zoo,

1116
00:54:59,001 --> 00:55:00,860
that's all censored,
you're not going to listen to them.

1117
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:05,910
Did I use podcasts and I don't even need
satellite radio because I just had all 

1118
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:06,000
podcasts are audible.
You know like you.

1119
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,160
You can download opie and anthony 
everyday on audible so.

1120
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:09,910
Well Dude.
Yeah.

1121
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:11,490
A lot of people get this off a 
honorable.

1122
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,420
They get this off of a bunch of 
different things.

1123
00:55:13,421 --> 00:55:16,180
You can put it on your iphone and put it
on your Ipod,

1124
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,280
put it in your car,
listen to it in the way to work.

1125
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:20,000
That's what a lot of people are doing.
I mean,

1126
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,940
that's the reason why this podcast is 
successful.

1127
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:24,040
It's not like everybody's got the time 
to this.

1128
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:25,720
I think most of the people are listening
to this.

1129
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:27,760
This is some background shit while 
they're working.

1130
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,710
Totally.
So my background friends,

1131
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,980
we're here for you baby.
All you people out there and regular 

1132
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:34,980
people land,

1133
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,910
working shitty job.
Joe,

1134
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:39,420
you said,
do you know anything about the UFC being

1135
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:42,140
in three d?
I live in filming in Three d for what?

1136
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,410
Do you know what they're going to do 
with that?

1137
00:55:43,411 --> 00:55:45,450
Do you have any idea how to talk to the 
boss?

1138
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,430
I don't know.
I need to get on that.

1139
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,470
That'd be cool.
Yeah.

1140
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:54,471
I don't know what they're doing.
They've been filling it for a while 

1141
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:55,020
though.
Very nice.

1142
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,580
A UFC card was fucking nasty.

1143
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,100
Nice.
Great.

1144
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,370
What'd you think about your boy Roy 
Nelson?

1145
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,650
What do you think you should do right 
now?

1146
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:04,660
So they lose weight,
Bro.

1147
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,440
He got hit 50 fucking times.
I mean,

1148
00:56:06,441 --> 00:56:07,460
it's not like,
you know,

1149
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,920
you got to take guys stood in there.
That guy takes it,

1150
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,500
you know,
whatever it takes to do that.

1151
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,950
He said he can take bombs.
No one's ever stood in there with junior

1152
00:56:15,951 --> 00:56:20,951
dos Santos for three rounds like that.
You think we get to the point where he 

1153
00:56:20,951 --> 00:56:22,080
just snaps and says,
fucking,

1154
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:23,980
I'm just going to watch my.
I'm going to get in

1155
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,360
great shape.
I'm going to go down a two.

1156
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:27,910
Oh five.
How you think that'll with those punches

1157
00:56:27,911 --> 00:56:32,911
to the head,
he might be able to move faster away 

1158
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:32,911
from him.
I don't know.

1159
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:34,120
What do you think?
He would definitely be.

1160
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:39,130
There's no way.
There's no way to a champion to be a 

1161
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:42,181
champion,
to have to be in the best shape of your 

1162
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:43,651
life.
He's obviously not in the best shape of 

1163
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:45,691
his life.
I know he likes to eat and all that 

1164
00:56:45,691 --> 00:56:47,311
stuff,
but I'm thinking something's eventually 

1165
00:56:47,311 --> 00:56:47,710
will make them snap.
He'll get shredded.

1166
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,930
He'll be.
He'll be training like a fucking home.

1167
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:54,931
So I think of Roy Nelson was really in 
shape and in shape or bad motherfucker 

1168
00:56:55,181 --> 00:56:55,740
two.
Oh five.

1169
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,150
He would crush.
He's got some serious knockout power.

1170
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,280
Let's just is awesome.
Jujitsu's awesome.

1171
00:57:00,281 --> 00:57:03,250
And he's,
you know,

1172
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:05,430
he's not afraid to fight and he can.

1173
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:09,730
He just needs to get in shape and enough
with the belly.

1174
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:14,790
That's all.
Now what about my job is kind of cool 

1175
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:16,320
about when that fucking big belly 
motherfucker knocks essentially.

1176
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:22,050
I'm a huge fan of right now,
so I would just like to see him 

1177
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:22,050
shredded.
That's my boy.

1178
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:24,520
Roy Rogers Nelson.
Is that Roy Rogers,

1179
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:28,240
Roy Rogers,
Roy Rogers,

1180
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:33,241
years ago.
Is there any news on cro cop at all use 

1181
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,740
on cro cop.
Where'd that come from?

1182
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,560
The chat room.
Don't listen to them.

1183
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,460
Those people are looking for a UFC 
questions.

1184
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,390
Don't listen.
No thiago out chat.

1185
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:49,590
People you use stream chat fucks you.
When you got a question for both of you 

1186
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,330
guys in the rematch,
how do you think it'll go down?

1187
00:57:52,331 --> 00:57:54,880
So the sun until shit.
Who knows,

1188
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:56,360
man,
I want to start a guest.

1189
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:01,390
You had to guess I would never.
You know what I'm interested in seeing 

1190
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:01,640
vtr now let me see.

1191
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,310
I want to see what vr can do to 
Anderson.

1192
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,620
I think that's what I was thinking 
about.

1193
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:08,230
A rematch for awhile,
which I would still love to see,

1194
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:09,640
you know,
cause it was such a close fight.

1195
00:58:09,641 --> 00:58:11,950
But the reality is an interesting one.
You know,

1196
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,990
he,
he did tap him and won convincingly,

1197
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:19,390
you know,
and the fight is an interesting 

1198
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:19,390
situation,
you know?

1199
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:21,210
I think I'd like to see that next.
What about you?

1200
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,760
I'd like to see a rematch.
Either one would be fine with me.

1201
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,380
I'd be fine with the rematch.
I would love,

1202
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:29,350
I would love to see a rematch and I 
would love to see the or fight.

1203
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,240
I would like to see him against a 
different guy.

1204
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,270
I mean I think we have Anderson for,
you know,

1205
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:38,430
only a certain amount of fights more.
I want to make sure that the fight 

1206
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,341
actually does happen and if it,
if they set it up now it can actually 

1207
00:58:41,341 --> 00:58:41,380
happen.
I think that's a big fight.

1208
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,980
If Dana decided to go with Silva son and
two,

1209
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,030
how do you think that would go down?
I think so would fuck them up quicker.

1210
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,040
I think so.

1211
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:56,250
I think so.
Maybe now he really worked at me like I 

1212
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,760
was telling jody and I the phone,
you predicted all this shit and the last

1213
00:58:57,761 --> 00:59:00,560
two big fights they will onboard,
you know,

1214
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,490
fader and this guy went down at the last
minute.

1215
00:59:03,491 --> 00:59:08,491
You know,
this is the only sport that if you 

1216
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:10,351
really watch UFC for a new watch,
you see the evolution and the vows so 

1217
00:59:11,021 --> 00:59:16,021
quickly.
It's not like baseball where they had 

1218
00:59:16,021 --> 00:59:16,390
like Sam gloves and 2000 or something.
I mean,

1219
00:59:16,391 --> 00:59:19,900
it's evolved so much and these files 
that a top level fighters,

1220
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,300
they evolve,
evolve

1221
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:27,320
also.
That's the only way to stay at the top 

1222
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:27,320
level,
you know,

1223
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:27,320
as we evolve also.
So.

1224
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:27,680
And Silva,
you know,

1225
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:32,770
I don't think you guys,
everybody keeps saying he pulled this 

1226
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:32,770
out of his ass.
You know,

1227
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:32,770
he,
he didn't pull it out,

1228
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:37,930
pull it.
I was asked this guy pull triangles out 

1229
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:37,930
of your ass.
You pull punches.

1230
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:39,230
I mean if you wing a wild punch,
the guy runs into it and you're like,

1231
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,360
wow,
what are the odds are that landed that I

1232
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:43,250
could see being kind of wild.
But it's still,

1233
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:48,251
I don't think that's why.
Because you were intending to punch the 

1234
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:48,260
guy in the face if you intend to punch 
the guy in the face and you do.

1235
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:50,750
How has that lucky not lucky.
It's silly.

1236
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:56,140
You know,
it's not like just because you got 

1237
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:56,140
caught and you know,
you can't say,

1238
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:56,140
oh he got you with a lucky punch.

1239
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:56,590
No,
he fucking punched you in there.

1240
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,910
He wanted to punch you.
And that's what he did.

1241
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,540
Like I was at Lucky,
lucky triangle.

1242
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,640
Get over,
they start to use either one of the 

1243
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:07,640
guys,
the gracies,

1244
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,740
their point was to to go Jujitsu,
it gets any other style to prove to the 

1245
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:16,751
world at Jujitsu,
could go up against any other style and 

1246
01:00:16,751 --> 01:00:17,810
that night that really came to fruition 
again,

1247
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,020
but it was disproven in the fight 
before.

1248
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:24,950
See what was important was that Anderson
was able to do something when he got put

1249
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:27,050
in a bad situation.
But look at Damien Maia,

1250
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:32,320
when Damien.
Mine was trying to get ahold of 

1251
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,770
androgens and Jujitsu certainly wasn't 
the answer because he needed to be able 

1252
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:36,941
to close the distance and get a takedown
until he gets that take down his 

1253
01:00:36,941 --> 01:00:38,570
Jujitsu's it's worthless.
So that was,

1254
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,070
that's what we saw in that fight.

1255
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,870
But what we saw with a killer,
like Anderson,

1256
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:47,140
a guy who's such a killer striker,
he's got to be dangerous off his back 

1257
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:47,140
and that's one of the beautiful things 
about Anderson.

1258
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:52,031
He is.
That's why I grabbed because I grabbed 

1259
01:00:52,031 --> 01:00:54,491
the good and the bad child.
Southern is a bad motherfucker and I 

1260
01:00:54,491 --> 01:00:54,491
applaud your dog.
You were there.

1261
01:00:54,491 --> 01:00:55,590
They're all nice and cute.
He left there,

1262
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:00,600
looked like Eddie Munster,
just like everyone gets ugly and 

1263
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:00,600
everybody fight,
Bro.

1264
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,010
That guy for time.
I was impressed.

1265
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,810
He was right.
I would love to see that rematch.

1266
01:01:05,811 --> 01:01:07,730
I would not be.
I would not be sad either way.

1267
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,070
I mean I would not be upset one way or 
another,

1268
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:11,570
either one.
I'm really looking forward to.

1269
01:01:11,571 --> 01:01:15,290
I just thought that while Anderson is 
young or relatively young man,

1270
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,240
I don't know how many more years he's 
going to want to do this.

1271
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,920
I want to see him fight all kinds of 
people.

1272
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:20,840
You know?
I want to see him fight Hector Lombard.

1273
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:22,940
You know what I'm saying?
I want to see him fight some interesting

1274
01:01:22,941 --> 01:01:24,970
dudes who were finding another place.
Jon Jones,

1275
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,360
Jon Jones,
Jon Jones up to five.

1276
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:28,990
That's the one.
Fuck yeah.

1277
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,620
Are you kidding me?
While we are writing from this and I,

1278
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:36,621
I don't,
I don't have a problem with the child 

1279
01:01:36,621 --> 01:01:36,621
center rematch if they decide to do 
that.

1280
01:01:36,621 --> 01:01:36,621
I would love that too.
Either one.

1281
01:01:36,621 --> 01:01:38,530
Either one is good jail southern Jon 
Jones.

1282
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,590
She's like,
we get so far the live ramp,

1283
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,440
but you know what?
Charlson is not fine at two.

1284
01:01:45,441 --> 01:01:47,240
Oh five.
He's always one 85.

1285
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:49,880
I mean I guess he could go up but he 
never has before.

1286
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:51,980
Right.
I mean maybe it was earlier.

1287
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:52,370
Fine.
Two,

1288
01:01:52,371 --> 01:01:53,000
two.
Oh five.

1289
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,750
I don't remember them though.
He was fighting into wc one 85.

1290
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:02,140
So Wec one 85 and UFC one 85.
I don't think he's ever Ms Dot Wade 

1291
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:04,030
because he missed weight.
Not that I can.

1292
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:09,210
So there's no reason to.
I mean Anderson like had some fights at 

1293
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:09,210
two.
Oh,

1294
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:09,210
five.
Like to go up there.

1295
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,700
I guess jail could do it too though.
You probably walked around pretty heavy,

1296
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:12,940
right?

1297
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:17,470
Jon Jones is a scary motherfucker 
though.

1298
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:19,410
That's a scary though.
They just got them.

1299
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:24,460
They're in a cage right now.
Let me know when they going to let them 

1300
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:24,460
out.
They might let them out on new years.

1301
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,460
They might let them out for the 
Thanksgiving thing.

1302
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:31,490
They don't even know.
They just give him a title shot right 

1303
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:31,490
away.
As soon as possible.

1304
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:34,800
I don't know why I fuck around because 
he wants to develop.

1305
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:36,900
He wants to be the greatest of all time.
He wants.

1306
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:39,030
He doesn't want a title shot.
Is that what you're saying?

1307
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,020
Oh,
he doesn't want a title shot.

1308
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:42,570
You Know Greg Jackson is the guy who 
guides him.

1309
01:02:42,571 --> 01:02:43,160
Right.
Gary?

1310
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:48,180
Greg Jackson said to me that what he 
wants to do is make sure that he's 

1311
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:51,111
tested before he fights for the title.
He wants him to really be tested and 

1312
01:02:51,111 --> 01:02:51,200
really to get worn on.

1313
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,440
I'm like,
Greg Jackson's a smart man and he got 

1314
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:56,440
smart.
He got tested.

1315
01:02:56,450 --> 01:03:00,140
He ran through brandon that he did.
He did Vladimir.

1316
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:01,800
Those are.
Those are some tests,

1317
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:06,801
right?
Buddy hasn't been put in an adverse 

1318
01:03:06,801 --> 01:03:08,751
situation.
That's what he's good because he's 

1319
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:08,751
bright,
but he wants to set them up with someone

1320
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,750
who may test them.
Who Will they taught them guys at two.

1321
01:03:10,751 --> 01:03:11,210
Oh,
five.

1322
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:16,250
That could probably work in right now 
that I don't know if anybody could work 

1323
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,010
him.
I think he might be able to beat Shogun.

1324
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:22,200
Yup.
I think he might be able to win the 

1325
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:22,200
title.
You know?

1326
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:22,200
I mean,
I,

1327
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,490
I think he's incredibly talented.
I could see shogun catching him and who 

1328
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:29,091
knows.
Shoguns really good office back to 

1329
01:03:29,091 --> 01:03:29,091
Shogun can dive on some leg locks and 
shit.

1330
01:03:29,091 --> 01:03:30,570
He doesn't fuck around.
Shoguns a bad motherfucker everywhere.

1331
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:33,420
But John is special athlete.

1332
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,880
He's got something.
He's got something.

1333
01:03:35,881 --> 01:03:40,881
The way he does it.
It's just so confident and he's got an 

1334
01:03:40,881 --> 01:03:40,881
aura about him,
you know,

1335
01:03:40,881 --> 01:03:45,140
to use the Hixon gracie term.
There's some shit that Jon Jones was 

1336
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:45,140
doing.
He's,

1337
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:48,950
he's got a very rare ability to look 
impressive against everybody and he's 

1338
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:52,740
super duper ultra cool.
So Nice.

1339
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,840
I mean,
it's just like the coolest dude.

1340
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,160
Coolest,
friendliest.

1341
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,230
He's down to Earth.
He's intelligent.

1342
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,850
The opposite of a Douche.
Yeah,

1343
01:03:59,851 --> 01:04:02,100
the opposite.
And he doesn't have a burden.

1344
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:05,130
Douchebags have a burden there.
Always hating themselves.

1345
01:04:05,131 --> 01:04:06,990
They're hating themselves to the way 
they treat other people.

1346
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:08,790
They hate themselves the way they live 
their life.

1347
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:09,480
They hate themselves.
Well,

1348
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:14,510
the negative energy,
they've created all the negative energy 

1349
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:14,510
from your childhood,
all that Shit.

1350
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:15,330
So they just,
everywhere they go,

1351
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,620
that wears you out,
man.

1352
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:22,140
You know,
it might motivate you to a certain 

1353
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:22,140
extent,
but when it comes to the long race,

1354
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,610
when you don't have time for ego and 
bullshit and it's all about,

1355
01:04:23,611 --> 01:04:24,510
you know,
who can really,

1356
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:26,400
who can raise the greatness faster.

1357
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:28,890
The guys who have the best personalities
get there better.

1358
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:33,330
They get there cleaner cut like fate or 
faith or has some doubters.

1359
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:35,100
But I don't know about any haters.
You know,

1360
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,260
who hates fader,
how can you hate that guy?

1361
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:41,220
He looks like a fucking dishwasher 
repairman and knock senseless,

1362
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:42,840
you know,
and he doesn't talk shit.

1363
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:48,200
Talk Shit ever.
And he doesn't even get upset when he 

1364
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,200
loses,
when he loses.

1365
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,200
He's gracious,
he's a gentleman,

1366
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,280
he doesn't lose for 10 years.
He loses and he says,

1367
01:04:50,281 --> 01:04:51,120
uh,
you know,

1368
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:54,600
those who do not fall down do not stand 
or something like that.

1369
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:57,030
Some.
So he said it more eloquently,

1370
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,480
eloquently,
something from the Internet.

1371
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:02,280
It's like he needed that last for 
character.

1372
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:03,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

1373
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:06,350
Who knows how he's going to come out in 
the next fight with something approved.

1374
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,710
You know,
just like Bj,

1375
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:10,500
anytime bj loses,
he always comes back on fire.

1376
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:12,960
You know,
they're not fucking doing fader and over

1377
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:15,370
him,
they're not doing that fight doing fader

1378
01:05:15,371 --> 01:05:18,730
and bigfoot or the overeem and bigfoot 
rather

1379
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:21,600
over.
So they given state or

1380
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:22,810
I don't know,
man,

1381
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,250
they know.
They don't know if they're going to do a

1382
01:05:24,251 --> 01:05:27,010
rematch or not,
but I want to see that over and fight or

1383
01:05:27,011 --> 01:05:28,240
flight.
That's what I want to say.

1384
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:33,510
That's the fight I want to say I want to
see for doing fight a overeem began for 

1385
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:34,360
the title for sure because we're doing 
beedamon pride,

1386
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:38,260
but I want to see overinflate or that's 
the fucking fight.

1387
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,010
That's a good fucking fights on the real
quick shout out to Matt Horwitz.

1388
01:05:45,011 --> 01:05:49,180
She's fighting out.
He's fighting Talus latest this Saturday

1389
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:54,240
and Irvine,
I think it's called war on the mainland 

1390
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:54,240
or something like that.
But uh,

1391
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,190
the,
the main fight is Tim Silvia verses Paul

1392
01:05:57,191 --> 01:06:02,191
Born Tello.
Matt Horwitz took the fight against 

1393
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,310
silence late to Sun on short notice,
but he's always in shape.

1394
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:06,340
His jujitsu's awesome.
It's going to be a great fight.

1395
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,520
I want to give a shout out to a kid,
Patrick from twitter.

1396
01:06:09,521 --> 01:06:13,510
It's his birthday today.
Good tweeted me and asked me,

1397
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,640
he said,
this kid had the same birthday as Rogan.

1398
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,980
If we give them a shout out,
happy birthday,

1399
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,680
Patrick.
I think hulk Hogan's birthday's today to

1400
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:22,000
that fucking will.
Hey,

1401
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:26,040
it's a time for a word from our sponsor.
No flashlight.

1402
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,240
We're back.
Bitches.

1403
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,810
Look at this or something that gave me 
that we talked about yesterday.

1404
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:41,410
Now why would they give you this for?
For folks that are only listening is a 

1405
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:45,571
limp rubber.
It's not real pink limp rubber Dick 

1406
01:06:45,571 --> 01:06:46,420
that's made out of the same material at 
the flashlights made out of.

1407
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,120
It's funny because they sell it like 
something to put on your coffee table as

1408
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:54,121
a gag.
It's just to make you feel uncomfortable

1409
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,980
that you just hold the deck in front of 
him,

1410
01:06:55,981 --> 01:06:57,980
man.
It's like Bachelorette parties.

1411
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,960
Stroking it yesterday.
Well,

1412
01:06:58,961 --> 01:07:02,140
we're talking.
Just sit there like a porn star.

1413
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,730
Eating off,
having a conversation.

1414
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,740
He's fucking face to wrestle you fucking
around.

1415
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,060
Fucking around,
man.

1416
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,290
We're going to start with a solid 
product.

1417
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,870
No,
it's blue advertisers.

1418
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,390
Blue.
Joey.

1419
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,330
Does she ever talk?
No.

1420
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,060
You missed shit.
I just watched kick ass.

1421
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:20,860
Wasn't that great?
Did you like it was 20 minutes too long,

1422
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:25,861
but the girl stole the fucking.
I love that because it's too low bullet 

1423
01:07:25,861 --> 01:07:26,280
the other night.
What?

1424
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,690
The law?
Yeah.

1425
01:07:27,691 --> 01:07:28,780
Yeah,
it's good to.

1426
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:32,860
Steve Mcqueen is always an animal.
It's crazy looking at San Francisco and

1427
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:33,380
uh,
you know,

1428
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:34,290
in the 19,
60,

1429
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,210
19,
68,

1430
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,770
there's nobody on the road.
You know,

1431
01:07:36,771 --> 01:07:39,320
you just driving.
It's easier on the highway.

1432
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:40,830
You just drive and I'm going to 
straighten.

1433
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,300
Just driving.
No.

1434
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:47,320
Realize how much the population has 
increased until you watch like a movie 

1435
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,801
from the sixties.
He still like New York Street in New 

1436
01:07:50,801 --> 01:07:50,801
York in the 19 fifties movie,
the Hustler.

1437
01:07:50,801 --> 01:07:53,270
There's not too many cars and,
but it's just driving around.

1438
01:07:53,271 --> 01:07:58,271
No problems.
Now we just take it for granted that 

1439
01:07:58,271 --> 01:07:58,640
anywhere you go,
it's gonna be a city,

1440
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:00,180
there's going to be too many people,
too many cars.

1441
01:08:00,181 --> 01:08:01,100
You're not gonna be able to get 
anywhere.

1442
01:08:01,101 --> 01:08:04,130
But at one point in time that wasn't the
case when they first made cities.

1443
01:08:04,131 --> 01:08:06,470
Like why would everybody lived together 
in this one thing?

1444
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:11,590
Well,
because when there's not that many 

1445
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:11,590
people and you can drive around,
it's really pretty fucking cool.

1446
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:13,640
New York City with no traffic.
That would be the shit.

1447
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:16,580
The drop boring.
I hate to be boring,

1448
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:19,130
wouldn't it?
Why would it be boring?

1449
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:21,540
That wouldn't be that many people will.
You can use.

1450
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:24,530
There would still be plenty of people.
You're still gonna have some traffic.

1451
01:08:24,531 --> 01:08:26,810
You're just not going to have the kind 
of traffic that you have now or it takes

1452
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:31,811
you half an hour to get across town.
At least you know it can take you hours 

1453
01:08:31,811 --> 01:08:32,120
to get around New York when it's around 
rush hour.

1454
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:33,920
It can take you forever to get out of 
the city,

1455
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,570
you know,
to get to long island to get the fuck.

1456
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,410
It's a nightmare.
There's too many fucking people.

1457
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,920
I sway people as an ongoing subject in 
this podcast.

1458
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,930
There's no answers.
That's the unfortunate problem.

1459
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Answers.
He just happened to move out of la or a 

1460
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,000
big cities and Columbus,
Ohio.

1461
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,960
It was always one mile,
one minute or better.

1462
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:55,910
Here it's like 15 minutes per mile is 
the average or something retarded,

1463
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,730
but people,
let's be honest,

1464
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,920
it's more fun here,
right?

1465
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,120
Well,
the weather's better.

1466
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:06,680
The weather's better for what we do.
It's better here by other people.

1467
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:08,870
Wines.
You run into more interesting people out

1468
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:12,200
here that you don't hang out with.
Retards that like any city,

1469
01:09:12,201 --> 01:09:17,201
there's cool people.
Like you've met some of my friends from 

1470
01:09:17,201 --> 01:09:17,201
Columbus if you know we all hung out 
there.

1471
01:09:17,201 --> 01:09:18,410
All Nice guys.
Yeah,

1472
01:09:18,411 --> 01:09:19,460
they're done.
Earth people.

1473
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:22,400
So where do you think is,
but don't you think like there's certain

1474
01:09:22,401 --> 01:09:26,240
parts of the country where people are 
more interesting per capita?

1475
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:31,600
Well,
just because you have more people like 

1476
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,890
top Texas is awesome is one of my 
favorite places ever been because it's 

1477
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:32,890
huge.
It's like a big city.

1478
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:34,100
People say that it's because there's 
more people,

1479
01:09:34,101 --> 01:09:36,020
but I also think that when you get a lot
of people together,

1480
01:09:36,021 --> 01:09:38,660
like in New York and in any big city 
like that,

1481
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,530
just the sheer competition,
there's so many people in there.

1482
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:47,710
Everybody's moving fast.
Everybody's got to keep up with 

1483
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:50,381
everybody else.
Like no one is like no one's faster 

1484
01:09:50,381 --> 01:09:52,160
thinker or faster talker than like East 
Coast people like New Jersey,

1485
01:09:52,161 --> 01:09:56,000
New York where they're angry.
The angry hustle competition,

1486
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:58,550
sort of a right jolly.
Don't you think New Yorkers?

1487
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,140
No one's more aggressive than New 
Yorkers

1488
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,900
as aggressive people,
but they're really aggressively.

1489
01:10:02,901 --> 01:10:04,660
Or you've got to fucking go in New York.
Yeah.

1490
01:10:04,661 --> 01:10:07,200
You got to go for the stop sign.

1491
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:10,000
How they do healing?
No,

1492
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:12,310
you go get the fuck somebody fucking 
gold.

1493
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,990
Fucking moron.
I got to get to the weed store.

1494
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,260
That shit don't make know.
Uh,

1495
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,830
there's just a lot of things I see that 
you look at and you're like,

1496
01:10:21,831 --> 01:10:23,960
this shit wouldn't fucking fly.
No,

1497
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,340
it's just wouldn't fly.
The other day,

1498
01:10:25,341 --> 01:10:29,180
some guy in front of my just pulled in 
front of my house and got in the car and

1499
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:30,650
three people behind them.
Beeper.

1500
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,630
I went upstairs and got my police badge 
and said,

1501
01:10:32,631 --> 01:10:35,720
move the fucking car bitch.
And they fucking moved,

1502
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,190
you know.
But it's like,

1503
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:38,960
Eh,
I don't like that part of it.

1504
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:39,840
Like,
you gotta go,

1505
01:10:39,841 --> 01:10:41,360
go bro.
What's all this knowledge?

1506
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:42,620
And you have really good.
Yeah,

1507
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,550
whether in really good conditions and 
things are easy,

1508
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:49,120
it tends to make you a bit soft and 
that's what I think.

1509
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,580
I think there's a lot of people that 
grow up out here,

1510
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:53,640
you know,
like a lot of Chad's,

1511
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:58,910
you know,
you know the type of guy I'm talking 

1512
01:10:58,910 --> 01:10:58,910
about,
like there's a softness.

1513
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:00,550
They don't have to deal with like harsh 
winters.

1514
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,740
They don't have to deal with the 
craziness that the northeast has to deal

1515
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:07,930
with.
You know what I mean?

1516
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,330
I think people think faster and the east
coast

1517
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,710
in general.
Oh,

1518
01:11:13,711 --> 01:11:14,010
you got to

1519
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:14,950
fucking thank you.
See,

1520
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,870
look at it.
Look at that thing.

1521
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:18,380
I watched the interview with William 
Chapman.

1522
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:20,580
He interviewed Bernard Goetz.
Yeah.

1523
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:21,810
Did you see that?
No.

1524
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,850
Is that interesting?
Very interesting.

1525
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,100
I heard Bernie gets used to be on opie 
and anthony all the time.

1526
01:11:26,101 --> 01:11:31,101
He's crazy.
He just shot for motherfuckers for just 

1527
01:11:31,101 --> 01:11:31,410
insinuating.
But he proved them right.

1528
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:32,440
He said they like,
I,

1529
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,300
you know,
was going to mug them.

1530
01:11:33,301 --> 01:11:36,030
Well look at 20 years later,
three out of the four in prison.

1531
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:42,770
Well,
it couldn't be because he shot him and 

1532
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:44,450
fuck their hand up and then they want 
that motherfucker what was crawling and 

1533
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:44,870
he went over and pulled the fucking 
trigger.

1534
01:11:44,871 --> 01:11:49,871
He had the bullets.
You see the fucking interviews he gave 

1535
01:11:49,871 --> 01:11:49,871
afterwards?
No.

1536
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:53,580
He told The New York Times that mothers 
should have had abortions.

1537
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:58,820
Listen,
you don't talk like that before you go 

1538
01:11:58,820 --> 01:11:58,820
to the sentencing.

1539
01:11:58,820 --> 01:11:58,820
That's the shit you say from behind 
bars.

1540
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:01,860
He was a stern guy,
but I think about that guy.

1541
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:03,270
When I think about New York,
he said,

1542
01:12:03,271 --> 01:12:06,270
I ain't even giving them the opportunity
and he's out of jail.

1543
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,740
Out of jail.
How long has it been out of jail?

1544
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,870
A long time.
I got thrown out of jail.

1545
01:12:10,871 --> 01:12:12,840
What happened?
I had to throw it out.

1546
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I did he go to jail.
What happened was he made bold 

1547
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,000
statements afterwards.
His attorneys were like,

1548
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,490
shut the fuck up guy.
So they prosecuted him for something 

1549
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:22,650
else.
I forget the story now.

1550
01:12:22,651 --> 01:12:24,750
If you look it up.
They prosecuted him for something else,

1551
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:28,710
but he was a hero.
I just don't want to encourage people to

1552
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:32,100
be vigilantes,
but the problem is man,

1553
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:35,880
but I look at that.
What do you do though?

1554
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,040
Do you know anthony from opie and 
Anthony.

1555
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,810
He's got to carry.
He carries a pistol.

1556
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:45,230
They don't talk about it on the radio.
I guess the station doesn't like 

1557
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:45,230
bringing it up,
but he,

1558
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:46,470
he's kind of.
He's got a fucking gun on him.

1559
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,220
You have to kind of carry pit permit.
You have to,

1560
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:53,520
you have Texas,
you can carry it with you.

1561
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:58,190
It's way better when you need it,
need it.

1562
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:03,220
And I'm a firm believer.
I guy carried a gun for years and 

1563
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,400
fucking bad guns and hot guns and I'll 
tell you what,

1564
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,960
and this is what I tell people all the 
time.

1565
01:13:06,961 --> 01:13:08,580
You carry a gun,
you carry a knife,

1566
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:11,700
you attract that energy.
The next time you get into a beef,

1567
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:14,370
some of these in have a knife.
I never carried a knife again.

1568
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:16,800
Nobody ever attacked me.
Like I got to tackle in life in Aspen,

1569
01:13:16,801 --> 01:13:19,530
Colorado really?
And I picked up a fucking pipe,

1570
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,960
but that if I wouldn't have slipped away
I did.

1571
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,960
That guy would have caught me,
picked up a pipe and hit him across the 

1572
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:26,960
fucking leg with it.
But he had a,

1573
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,860
he had like a little fucking.
Where were you attack that?

1574
01:13:28,861 --> 01:13:33,861
We were hanging behind like a strip club
at three and I was at a gas station and 

1575
01:13:33,861 --> 01:13:35,940
the guy was fixing my car like a,
like a big garage place.

1576
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:38,250
And the guy thought I had said something
to them.

1577
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,210
I'm like,
I didn't send them to you.

1578
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,140
My car's right.
He was like,

1579
01:13:40,141 --> 01:13:40,590
no,
no,

1580
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:43,890
you cut me off before I haven't been 
here for two hours.

1581
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,210
He was just looking for somebody to 
stamp.

1582
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:48,870
He was just a little crazy.
She pulled the knife out,

1583
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:54,140
he went like this and I moved back and 
when I moved back there was a pipe on 

1584
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:54,140
the fucking like,
you know,

1585
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:58,261
those pipes for wiring.
They were doing the place and I slipped 

1586
01:13:58,261 --> 01:13:58,261
and I picked up the fucking pipe.

1587
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:01,140
But I always remembered that when I 
carried a gun,

1588
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,420
everywhere I go,
people had fucking guns.

1589
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,060
I got a gram of coke.
The motherfucker had a gun.

1590
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:10,040
What are the odds?
Stopped casual.

1591
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,970
There was a coke dealer with a gun.
Wait a minute.

1592
01:14:12,971 --> 01:14:14,340
Once I stopped,
you know,

1593
01:14:14,341 --> 01:14:19,341
like one time I heard a bullet go off 
one night when I had a gun real 20 feet 

1594
01:14:19,341 --> 01:14:20,440
behind me.
The guy shot another guy in a club,

1595
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:21,820
you know,
and this was,

1596
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:27,300
I was a kid.
I remember hearing that fucking thing 

1597
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:27,300
and I stopped with guns.
How old were you?

1598
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:32,670
Twenty four maybe,
but I never ever cared after I got 

1599
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:33,680
caught for the machine gun with the 
kidnapping.

1600
01:14:33,681 --> 01:14:38,681
I never bought the last time.
When was the last time you went out?

1601
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:43,420
Didn't happen.
Somebody's machine gun.

1602
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,190
Fuck Ya.
No fucking around one.

1603
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:48,460
What you got pitched the things over 
here like with the ammo.

1604
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:53,440
That's the ultimate shit.
You can tell somebody.

1605
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,660
You know what I mean?
Little things.

1606
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:58,570
The little instant respect.
Tell me you were arrested for kidnapping

1607
01:14:58,571 --> 01:15:00,660
and yet a machine gun.
Damn,

1608
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:02,650
that's deep.
I don't want to fuck with that dude.

1609
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:06,600
That's the way to get out of a wedding 
with a gun.

1610
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,380
I have a lot of things.
Trust me,

1611
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:14,370
I got something to tell you.
Carry your weapon that it'd be prepared 

1612
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:16,000
to carry that weapon.
I tell that to people all the time.

1613
01:15:16,001 --> 01:15:16,570
People like,
Bro,

1614
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:19,510
I'm thinking about getting a gun bitch.
Before you take that gun out,

1615
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,840
you better think twice.
Is it possible?

1616
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:27,841
Here's the question,
is it possible for human beings to ever 

1617
01:15:27,841 --> 01:15:29,680
evolve past this?
Is it possible for people to ever evolve

1618
01:15:29,681 --> 01:15:33,220
past violence and bullshit and lies and 
and hate?

1619
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:36,490
Is it possible or do we need it?
We need it.

1620
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,700
We needed to because it fuels.
It makes you appreciate,

1621
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,710
love more,
makes you struggle more.

1622
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:45,910
It makes the competition greater.
Thinking about what's going on.

1623
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:47,740
Think about that.
Half a world away.

1624
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:50,440
Everybody's got a machine gun shooting 
at each other.

1625
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:55,441
Right now you're going to be walking in 
Israel and fucking a bus going home and 

1626
01:15:55,441 --> 01:16:00,211
somebody comes up and says,
fuck the Jews and they fucking pull the 

1627
01:16:00,211 --> 01:16:00,320
switches,
but on a,

1628
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:03,010
on a smaller scale,
if people can be.

1629
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,620
Is it just a certain amount?
Is it a certain number?

1630
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,190
Is it like after a certain number,
you can't be friends with everybody.

1631
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:11,500
I mean,
how the fuck the wars get started?

1632
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:13,750
I mean it doesn't get started with a 
group as small as us,

1633
01:16:13,751 --> 01:16:15,010
right?
It's not for people.

1634
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:19,000
So if four people can get along what,
what are the numbers?

1635
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:21,190
What are the numbers where everybody can
have a good,

1636
01:16:21,191 --> 01:16:25,760
healthy every 20 people 20 years,
one bad motherfucker,

1637
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,680
but if you can get rid of them,
what's a manageable size?

1638
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:32,980
Like if you wanted to start a tribe of 
all your own people,

1639
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,440
what's a manageable size where everybody
can be cool with each other.

1640
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:40,830
Nobody's going to have any problems with
each other where we're all going to be 

1641
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:41,300
friendly.
Everyone's going to whine.

1642
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,510
One in the cat,
the cat,

1643
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:47,230
the of flashlight.
It's impossible.

1644
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,440
Listen man.
And and and,

1645
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:51,730
and a drama.
Sometimes you need it.

1646
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:54,790
I think so to change this an expression,
I can't remember.

1647
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:58,060
I've said this before and it sounds 
crazy,

1648
01:16:58,061 --> 01:17:00,370
but I think it's all a mathematical 
equation.

1649
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,300
I think everything you do in his life,
all the people you come in contact with,

1650
01:17:04,301 --> 01:17:06,190
all your actions,
all your motions,

1651
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:10,010
it's all part of a giant equation and 
everybody's equation that's piling

1652
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,290
up together.
Everybody's numbers.

1653
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:17,291
Everybody.
What you're doing is affecting me when 

1654
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:19,481
I'm doing is affecting him.
We're all doing it together and it's 

1655
01:17:19,481 --> 01:17:21,050
we're working towards some fucking crazy
goal that we just can't say.

1656
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:26,900
I believe that me to Vinton Zeus wasn't 
the god of war.

1657
01:17:26,901 --> 01:17:30,790
What was the mythology?
Zeus or thor was a goddess.

1658
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,920
Thunder.
A war was one of those guys said he was 

1659
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:35,920
so bad.
Motherfucker.

1660
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,900
The grand poupon.
One of those guys sent this sudden down 

1661
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:44,021
to see what was going on at this 
motherfucker came back and everything 

1662
01:17:44,021 --> 01:17:45,260
talked about war,
all the damage this guy had done.

1663
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:49,490
His son when he went and he asked,
is something what the fuck is going on?

1664
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,810
You know,
what are you doing?

1665
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:52,110
What?
He's chopping these heads off.

1666
01:17:52,111 --> 01:17:53,340
He says,
without war,

1667
01:17:53,341 --> 01:17:55,760
there's no change.
Is that what it is?

1668
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:57,860
Something to do?
Yeah,

1669
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:00,670
but the question is can we evolve past 
us?

1670
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:04,190
The problem is you look at the numbers,
you look at sustainability,

1671
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:07,250
like the,
just the sheer numbers of human beings,

1672
01:18:07,251 --> 01:18:12,251
and then you look at the amount of space
that we have and you've got to think if 

1673
01:18:12,251 --> 01:18:15,071
we're at like six or $7 billion now,
what's gonna Happen when it's $20 

1674
01:18:15,071 --> 01:18:15,280
million?
What's going to happen when it's $80?

1675
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:15,470
Million?

1676
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:18,770
There's a shitload of land now.
So there's,

1677
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:21,820
there's tons and tons of land.
If you go to Ohio,

1678
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,820
there's just millions and millions of 
acres of land.

1679
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:26,730
So think everybody's just moved to Ohio.
I know,

1680
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,950
I'm just saying that there's a lot of 
states out there like,

1681
01:18:29,951 --> 01:18:34,951
you know,
South Dakota is that there's fucking 

1682
01:18:34,951 --> 01:18:34,951
land everywhere

1683
01:18:34,951 --> 01:18:35,120
growing their food.
Uh,

1684
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:37,220
Mexico.
Where are they getting their meat?

1685
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,510
Mexico.
Mexico,

1686
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:39,710
Japan.

1687
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,120
Yeah.
Um,

1688
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:41,900
I don't know,
man.

1689
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:47,170
That's what I worry about.
That's the kind of shit that fills my 

1690
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:47,170
head up every day.
Stopped taking it about getting drunk.

1691
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:51,980
I got to get you some Marie low man your
weed and get some take away your 

1692
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:55,590
birthday.
We got to start some shoppers shop.

1693
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,390
You have to kill her.
I got to drop to drinking,

1694
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,400
just hanging around with a bunch of men 
will go into the tank together for us.

1695
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:05,300
I'm not.
I'm not looking for birthday shots.

1696
01:19:05,301 --> 01:19:06,350
Thank you though.
Appreciate it.

1697
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:08,060
How about birthday?
High fives.

1698
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,180
All you with everybody.
The olive garden.

1699
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,840
Olive Garden later go to the off 
gardens.

1700
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:19,900
My favorite.
When you're there,

1701
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:22,670
your family though.
You didn't say it right?

1702
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:25,280
Say it the right way.
When you hear your family,

1703
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,910
there was that show that used to be on 
Sirius.

1704
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:30,440
The wiseguys showed you remember that 
show?

1705
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:31,540
I'd never heard it.
Oh,

1706
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,490
it was.
It was that for two hours.

1707
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:38,410
It's not even available anymore.
You don't have anymore.

1708
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:39,840
Part of it made me a the

1709
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:45,300
nostalgic part.
It made me remember all these idiots 

1710
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,730
that I knew back in New York.
Very,

1711
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:49,720
very specific part of the country now.
Very specific.

1712
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,330
So it's going to be interested in UFC is
in Boston.

1713
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:54,800
There you go.
That's what Fox.

1714
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:58,500
What do you think so far?
Just Bj and fucking Frankie Edgar to.

1715
01:19:58,510 --> 01:19:59,890
It's going to be interesting,
man.

1716
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:00,840
Gonna.
That's gonna.

1717
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:03,370
Be Interesting as fuck because you know 
pj is going to come out angry.

1718
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:06,980
I think Bj is to try to take Frankie 
Edgar down.

1719
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:08,750
I think you're right.
I'm trying to strangle them.

1720
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:14,440
I think you're totally right.
All he didn't have fight with standing 

1721
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:14,440
bang with them and try to stuff to take 
down.

1722
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:19,070
You know,
I think Bj a learned less than that 

1723
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:19,070
fight.
He's gonna come back stronger than ever.

1724
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:23,390
But Frankie Edgar's coming back stronger
than ever to man and Frankie Edgar is 

1725
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:23,880
better and every fight,
every time that dude fights,

1726
01:20:23,881 --> 01:20:25,650
you see a new,
improved version of him,

1727
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:28,800
you know,
after he beat Sean Sherk.

1728
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:33,890
And then after he uh,
beat Matt Veech and strangled Matt 

1729
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:33,890
Veech,
I was like,

1730
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:34,860
this guy is fucking getting better,
man.

1731
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:37,220
He's getting better.
And then when he beat Bj did,

1732
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,090
he's going to be even better now coming 
into this fight.

1733
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:44,120
He's going to kick it up another notch 
and he's not getting tired thinking 

1734
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:44,120
about that dude.
He does not get tired.

1735
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:46,380
He can go five,
five minute rounds,

1736
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:47,700
full clip.
And He's good.

1737
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,640
He's good.
It's crazy.

1738
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:56,690
He doesn't get tired.
He was just as fast in the fucking fit 

1739
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:56,690
for hours.
He wasn't.

1740
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:56,690
The third is the.
Just wasn't a second.

1741
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,570
I think it gets tired at night.
I think he go night night.

1742
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:06,120
I think you get some warm milk and maybe
someone reads them a story and I can get

1743
01:21:07,081 --> 01:21:08,580
tired and then he goes,
no,

1744
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,100
no,
totally ready.

1745
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,290
Go to it.
Last.

1746
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:12,840
James,
Tony,

1747
01:21:12,841 --> 01:21:15,120
randy coture is a fucking fascinating 
fight,

1748
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:15,390
man.

1749
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:16,980
I loved it.
I love,

1750
01:21:16,981 --> 01:21:21,981
first of all the fact that James,
Tony is the first guy who's like a real 

1751
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:27,260
professional boxer at a,
at a high level stepping into mma and 

1752
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:28,800
yeah,
he's 41 but he still got skills.

1753
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:30,630
Do James.
Tony is still a bad motherfucker.

1754
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:32,970
Randy couture is like 48,
47 I believe.

1755
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:33,900
Yeah.
So,

1756
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:39,180
but you know,
the thing is like he's doing the right 

1757
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:39,680
things.
He's training with a Antonio Monkey.

1758
01:21:39,681 --> 01:21:43,200
He's training with Mola Wall is trending
with King Mo training with wrestlers.

1759
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:48,240
You know,
they're teaching them how to try to 

1760
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:48,240
stand up.
Who knows?

1761
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,810
All he has to do though,
realistically all he has to do his 

1762
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:51,330
stuff.
One tank down,

1763
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:55,530
stuff from one tank down and get close 
enough to get a hand free.

1764
01:21:55,950 --> 01:22:00,950
Just get close enough.
I have a position where he's got a 

1765
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:04,371
little,
a little bit of distance he created and 

1766
01:22:04,371 --> 01:22:05,850
fucking all he has to do is one with 
those four ounce gloves.

1767
01:22:05,851 --> 01:22:09,300
I'm not saying he can do it,
but I'm saying if he can do it,

1768
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:11,940
chances are he's gonna fuck randy up.
If he can land it.

1769
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,130
My sources telling me he's not training 
at all.

1770
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:14,450
Really?

1771
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,320
This is bad for the promotion of the 
Bravo.

1772
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:19,890
Oh no,
he's training a lot.

1773
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,180
Yeah.
Well Eddie did I just fuck it up?

1774
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:29,240
I think he might have fucked it up.
Part of the promotion has he been 

1775
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:32,061
trained in today's today is opposite day
by the way,

1776
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:34,210
as the opposite thing.
Oh,

1777
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,310
that is opposite time.
Well,

1778
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:36,960
who knows,
man,

1779
01:22:36,961 --> 01:22:38,590
maybe they're.
They're putting out rumors,

1780
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:41,100
studies,
training so that people will respect it.

1781
01:22:41,101 --> 01:22:46,101
But I know he lost weight.
He looked pretty God damn thing when I 

1782
01:22:46,101 --> 01:22:46,290
was interviewing him.
He didn't look fat at all to him at home

1783
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:51,310
with a fucking train of fucking shit.
Whatever you posted on fuck about trey.

1784
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:53,740
Fuck that.
I'm gonna.

1785
01:22:53,741 --> 01:22:55,230
Go Run for 10.
This is what he said to me.

1786
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:59,250
It was no punch.
Punch.

1787
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,610
Three inches,
three inches on.

1788
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:04,040
Knock his ass out.
That's all

1789
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,050
it is,
right?

1790
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:08,530
Do let me tell you something.
He,

1791
01:23:08,531 --> 01:23:09,730
if he,
if he clipped you,

1792
01:23:09,731 --> 01:23:11,350
look,
this just like that.

1793
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,180
Just gave himself like three or four 
inches.

1794
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:16,300
It would fucking really hurt.
It really hurt.

1795
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:16,870
He could.
Jack.

1796
01:23:16,871 --> 01:23:20,260
He was given it up to Bristol.
A bad motherfucker.

1797
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:21,920
He got it wrong though.
I told it.

1798
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,020
Dana.
Dana goes,

1799
01:23:23,021 --> 01:23:28,021
Bruce Lee at a one inch punch.
Why can't they figure out the Bruce Lee 

1800
01:23:28,021 --> 01:23:28,930
killings and like all the murders and 
stuff.

1801
01:23:28,931 --> 01:23:33,931
That whole family murders,
but you think there would be by now dna 

1802
01:23:33,931 --> 01:23:34,030
or something.
They can.

1803
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:37,600
They can solve so many heresy.
Bryan spears,

1804
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,760
we need to get mythbusters on.
Did they just give up on that whole 

1805
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:42,760
thing?
They've ever even looked into it.

1806
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,390
I don't think there was a conspiracy 
that I've even looked into it.

1807
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:46,620
Was there a conspiracy?
Was Bruce Lee yesterday?

1808
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:47,850
What was it?

1809
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:54,410
What was the conspiracy was found dead 
asleep and like some has Mr [inaudible] 

1810
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,960
apartment.
So they think someone killed him.

1811
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:59,770
They think someone did.
And his son,

1812
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:05,740
why would they kill us?
Fuck you and your son killed his son 

1813
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:09,430
later in like put a bullet into the gun.
That was supposed to be a blank gun.

1814
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,600
Right?
How do you get it?

1815
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:15,680
How do you get a real gun on a set that 
doesn't even come close to you don't 

1816
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,230
look into Brandon Lee back in the day.
Yeah.

1817
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:19,750
So what were the details that it was in 
competence?

1818
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:22,470
No.
Why would there be a right.

1819
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,490
You have props for movies and stuff like
that.

1820
01:24:24,491 --> 01:24:29,491
You don't use real guns.
They're just not even a real gun on 

1821
01:24:29,491 --> 01:24:29,491
warner brothers except in the security 
guys.

1822
01:24:29,491 --> 01:24:30,190
His pockets,
you know,

1823
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,670
but,
but you don't mix fucking fake guns with

1824
01:24:33,671 --> 01:24:35,050
real guns.
That's impossible,

1825
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:35,710
you know?

1826
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:36,400
Well,
it's not that.

1827
01:24:36,401 --> 01:24:38,380
It's not a real gun.
It's a real gun.

1828
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,000
It's just shooting a blank.
Right?

1829
01:24:40,001 --> 01:24:43,210
But they can't.
Those guns can't shoot real.

1830
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:48,211
People have died by taking those guns 
and putting them up to their head with 

1831
01:24:48,211 --> 01:24:48,370
no bullet in it and it's blown their 
brains out.

1832
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:48,900
You know that,
right?

1833
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:49,990
Right.
But that's not what happened.

1834
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,840
You know,
he would happen with.

1835
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:56,880
What I read was that it was,
there was something in the barrel on 

1836
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:57,880
that as he fired the blank,
something,

1837
01:24:57,910 --> 01:24:59,080
something,
whatever it was in the barrel,

1838
01:24:59,081 --> 01:25:01,750
we should probably look it up when we 
were talking out of our ass,

1839
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:03,820
but he did get shot and killed on sap.

1840
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:09,250
I always felt that the father got ice 
because when he left Rudd Rudd and those

1841
01:25:09,351 --> 01:25:12,290
motherfuckers to come to the United 
States to shoot into the dragon,

1842
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:17,620
that was his ent.
There was a seat that was big heroin 

1843
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,470
money.
I'm telling you this from the heart.

1844
01:25:18,471 --> 01:25:20,750
If you know anything about that,
you check out that company.

1845
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,450
The people may fist of fury and Chinese 
connection.

1846
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:28,810
They invested.
You know what it costs to make the 

1847
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:28,810
Chinese connection.
How much?

1848
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:30,160
80,000
really know how much.

1849
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:31,970
You know how many times they made that 
over.

1850
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,520
Do the fucking man.
How much he thinks that movies my head,

1851
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:36,950
look at it.
There was no explosions.

1852
01:25:36,951 --> 01:25:40,770
There's no three g,
there's no three d go Sag.

1853
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:42,440
How much you think the Chinese 
connection is made?

1854
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:44,510
$10 a day for all those Japanese guys.

1855
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,790
So you're saying that the company that 
made festival,

1856
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:53,660
the people who put up the producers on 
that,

1857
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:56,840
if you know anything about Raymond Chow,
it's all heroin.

1858
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:58,820
It's direct.
They were money laundering.

1859
01:25:59,810 --> 01:26:02,270
Money Laundering guys,
you know you've got to make up to,

1860
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:03,770
to,
to have Mercedes.

1861
01:26:03,771 --> 01:26:05,660
I got to make money and make this 
Mercedes.

1862
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:08,060
I got to make it the cover this.
How am I doing this?

1863
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:11,390
He made three movies.
They will all box office.

1864
01:26:11,391 --> 01:26:15,260
Fucking worldwide smashes.
One was bigger than the other and I come

1865
01:26:15,261 --> 01:26:16,250
to you and I go,
Hey,

1866
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:18,680
I'm happy now.
If anybody knows anything about anything

1867
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:24,040
mafia concept and even the Italian,
those morons could never figure that 

1868
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:24,050
out.
It's fucking Chinese.

1869
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,000
You know?
Look at Japan.

1870
01:26:26,001 --> 01:26:31,001
When you fuck up in the in Japan,
don't they cut your fucking finger or 

1871
01:26:31,001 --> 01:26:31,880
don't you have to color up?
If I told you to cut your finger off,

1872
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:34,040
what were the chances you understand me?

1873
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,840
These people don't fuck around.
They're not white.

1874
01:26:35,841 --> 01:26:40,841
They're not sure if these people don't.
So they were making tons of money to 

1875
01:26:40,841 --> 01:26:45,771
leave them.
He decided to go to warner brothers to 

1876
01:26:45,771 --> 01:26:45,771
make enter the dragon,
and so they killed.

1877
01:26:45,771 --> 01:26:47,480
They gave him a little taste,
but not the taste.

1878
01:26:47,481 --> 01:26:49,820
They were waiting on.
Not The big taste they were waiting on.

1879
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:54,850
They made Raymond Chow,
a little partner and then they gave him 

1880
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:57,671
a piece of death with Charles Bronson,
but that wasn't enough.

1881
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:59,520
So you really think that's what 
happened.

1882
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,850
Any other ideas?
Oh,

1883
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:03,800
I mean,
I don't know if it's officially.

1884
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:06,230
It was a brain aneurysm.
It's a brain aneurysm.

1885
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:08,540
While when someone shooting in the head,
your brain bleeds,

1886
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:10,520
right?
It's mysterious.

1887
01:27:10,521 --> 01:27:12,230
Nobody knows nothing.
I mean,

1888
01:27:12,231 --> 01:27:14,660
he was 33 years old.
He was in perfect health.

1889
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:16,640
You know,
it could have been poisoned.

1890
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:17,250
You know,
the.

1891
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:19,220
You could say that we could have paid 
for this,

1892
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:22,670
the Chinese could have paid for this all
across the line to the,

1893
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:24,230
you know,
that's a corrupt country.

1894
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:29,231
Like any other place like that,
they could have paid dr to say whatever 

1895
01:27:29,231 --> 01:27:29,231
the fuck they would've said they buried 
them.

1896
01:27:29,231 --> 01:27:30,740
And that's it.
Why hasn't Linda,

1897
01:27:30,741 --> 01:27:35,741
Lisa,
let's dig up the motherfucking body and 

1898
01:27:35,741 --> 01:27:35,741
see what's really crackalackin lacking 
because they probably gave her.

1899
01:27:35,741 --> 01:27:37,250
She knows they killed his son to boot 
brush.

1900
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:39,170
So your husband and your fucking son 
dies.

1901
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:42,380
This is a coincidence.
Was there any threats on his life?

1902
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:50,390
Reading how it actually happened?
I guess they were using blanks but they 

1903
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:54,381
were rushed at a time.
So they took real bullets and took out 

1904
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:58,311
the,
the powder out of the bullets that I 

1905
01:27:58,311 --> 01:27:58,920
guess would also make a blank.
Uh,

1906
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:02,010
so.
But what happened is somebody on unknown

1907
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:07,100
fired those blanks and they reinserted 
like bullets on top of it,

1908
01:28:07,141 --> 01:28:12,141
like more blanks.
And so eight exploded in a piece of a 

1909
01:28:12,141 --> 01:28:13,320
bullet flew out of it or something like 
that.

1910
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:21,520
Because not only are we going to shoot,
you were going to shoot you on fucking 

1911
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:21,520
camera.
I didn't.

1912
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,710
I don't think it was crazy videos on 
youtube.

1913
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:26,660
Yeah,
right,

1914
01:28:26,661 --> 01:28:28,290
exactly.
There's just so many.

1915
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:32,990
It's just weird going to watch it by so 
many doubts with both of them.

1916
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:34,520
That's that.
It's not,

1917
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:39,920
you know,
it's just the brandon sounds like it 

1918
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:40,850
could be just a coincidence that all of 
a sudden he was dead and buried and gun.

1919
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:46,120
That's it.
And then the movie came out two weeks 

1920
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:46,550
later because he died before the break.
Perfect timing died.

1921
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:50,460
He died July 16th or something like 
that.

1922
01:28:50,461 --> 01:28:55,461
And the movie came out eight days later 
they were filming the movie and they 

1923
01:28:55,461 --> 01:28:57,170
were done filming and then they released
it eight days later after he died.

1924
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,290
None of the movie was done.
Two weeks before they it.

1925
01:29:01,291 --> 01:29:01,950
He died.
He died.

1926
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:04,290
He never,
he wait one more movie.

1927
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:08,910
It was legend wasn't there?
I was 10 minutes.

1928
01:29:08,911 --> 01:29:11,320
I thought you were talking about Brandon
Lee though.

1929
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:12,690
Bruce.
I'm sorry.

1930
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:17,640
So you know the cell body catalysis as 
this is American studio,

1931
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:19,490
they would never kill somebody.
You know what I'm saying?

1932
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:21,930
You don't.
I think there's some crazy producers out

1933
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:23,670
there that we kill people.
They understand.

1934
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:26,370
They understand the depth equals money.
Now,

1935
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:28,520
is there a documentary out there about 
brandon?

1936
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:33,530
I think there is.
I think was it legend or survivor 

1937
01:29:34,021 --> 01:29:39,021
producer?
His wife and Cancun and he's back.

1938
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:44,810
He's back in America.
Mexican government's trying to figure 

1939
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:46,290
out how to prosecute him.
You're going to from Mexico can kill his

1940
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:48,280
wife.
Bob will tell you something.

1941
01:29:49,070 --> 01:29:51,090
I'll know if you seen it.
I mean,

1942
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:56,150
I've been on that side of the fence.
I just watched that Michael Jackson 

1943
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:58,200
documentary again a couple of weeks ago.
I'm looking at his death,

1944
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,580
but know about the thing we want to see 
that night.

1945
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:08,490
I'm watching him watching him.
Does he look like a fucking dude?

1946
01:30:09,691 --> 01:30:13,080
That's fucked up to you.
As much as they said he was fucked up to

1947
01:30:13,081 --> 01:30:14,140
do all those dance.
Move.

1948
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:15,900
Watch the movie.
You're an intelligent guy.

1949
01:30:15,901 --> 01:30:19,080
You get back to me or he wasn't just 
doing coke or whatever.

1950
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:24,081
He was doing oxygen or whatever the fuck
they said he was doing that one part 

1951
01:30:24,081 --> 01:30:25,890
where he freaks out.
Remember he fucking freaked out.

1952
01:30:25,891 --> 01:30:28,980
There's one part where they.
They show most of the movies.

1953
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:33,981
Just all good.
I don't even get into drugs or anything 

1954
01:30:33,981 --> 01:30:33,981
like that.
It's all good,

1955
01:30:33,981 --> 01:30:37,490
but they showed a piece where he's 
freaking out with the director and he 

1956
01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:37,970
doesn't feel.
It feels like it feels like just.

1957
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:43,080
I don't know what it is.
We got to get the right mixture,

1958
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,430
but that guy was a freak.
I was going.

1959
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:48,100
They were going to take this little 
Afro.

1960
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:48,960
We're going to take.
Never,

1961
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:53,961
never land so much money on 
motherfuckers made since he's been dead 

1962
01:30:53,961 --> 01:30:53,961
a lot.
Right?

1963
01:30:53,961 --> 01:30:53,961
Punch,
punch.

1964
01:30:53,961 --> 01:30:58,720
They're all jumping up and down.
The Red Dragon was the documentary by 

1965
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:58,720
Red Dragon,
the Bruce Lee documentary.

1966
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:00,190
It's Lee,
Brandon Lee.

1967
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,880
Both Brandon Lee,
sorry,

1968
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,100
grabbing Red Dragon,
red dragon.

1969
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:09,540
Cool.
Little bit conspiracy guy,

1970
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:14,240
but it just,
just to his death definitely sounds like

1971
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:17,220
if he had some very few really pissed 
off some Chinese mob guys,

1972
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:19,800
I don't think they would let that slide 
because the guy became a movie star,

1973
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,600
you know,
if he's making some other people.

1974
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:22,800
Yeah,
I could see them killing them.

1975
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:25,860
I don't know the details either where 
they shot those movies.

1976
01:31:25,861 --> 01:31:28,020
They shut those.
Like those movies cost nothing.

1977
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:30,480
They shot those in the jungles of 
Thailand.

1978
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:35,780
Fist of fury.
The first one they shot that there was 

1979
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:38,541
no set.
They shot that in the jungle with pilot 

1980
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:38,541
on a dark street.

1981
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:39,480
There was no,
there was no crap services.

1982
01:31:39,481 --> 01:31:44,481
There was no.
There was one tons and a fucking type 

1983
01:31:44,481 --> 01:31:44,481
with Chinese music on.
You know what I'm saying?

1984
01:31:44,481 --> 01:31:49,310
It's crazy.
When you think about how recent movies 

1985
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:50,400
really are when a recent invention,
I mean movies were,

1986
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:55,430
you know,
I believe in the 19 hundreds they were 

1987
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:55,430
silent,
right?

1988
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:56,680
When did they start making sound movies?
Sure.

1989
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,980
A 40 years.
And by the way,

1990
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:01,360
that was Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee.
Sorry,

1991
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,000
what was that?
Red Dragon.

1992
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,070
Oh,
that was the documentary on Brandon,

1993
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,880
Bruce Lee.
Bruce Lee.

1994
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:10,590
Okay.
But I think it was like 1940.

1995
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:15,640
I would say 19.
Was that when you start thinking about 

1996
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:18,420
how recent invention movies are,
the crazy thing about the whole movie 

1997
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:20,230
experiences,
it really does program you.

1998
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:24,130
We have some certain things that we want
to see in life and when you show them to

1999
01:32:24,131 --> 01:32:27,220
us like we have a natural inclination to
fall successful people.

2000
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,570
It's natural,
you know,

2001
01:32:28,571 --> 01:32:33,571
fall.
Someone who's better than you learn how 

2002
01:32:33,571 --> 01:32:33,571
to be better than you are,
you know,

2003
01:32:33,571 --> 01:32:36,781
learn,
learn from people that have already 

2004
01:32:36,781 --> 01:32:36,781
learned.
But when you see a movie,

2005
01:32:36,781 --> 01:32:39,490
it's like the guy has all these 
attributes of the hero in real life,

2006
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,520
but it's fake and he's 60 feet tall and 
every time he talks fucking music plays 

2007
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,040
and your whole system gets so confused 
because you really.

2008
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:50,260
The girls,
especially girls,

2009
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:55,530
there's a lot of people that believe 
that life really should be like a movie 

2010
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:56,830
that was really shocked that life 
doesn't turn out like a moving.

2011
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,230
How crazy.
It wasn't that when Bruce Lee,

2012
01:32:59,231 --> 01:33:03,320
all he ever wanted was a shot in 
Hollywood and he got ripped off.

2013
01:33:03,321 --> 01:33:05,680
He got rejected,
he got sent back to China,

2014
01:33:05,681 --> 01:33:08,590
he blows up in China and now warner 
brothers wants him back.

2015
01:33:08,591 --> 01:33:11,410
Now they want to know,
and then he finally gets a shot.

2016
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:16,410
He gets the fuck.
He gets to call the shots of the movie 

2017
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:16,410
and it doesn't show up to the set.
He has cold feet.

2018
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:19,300
He's fucking nervous as hell.
They're shooting around him.

2019
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:21,160
He won't show up.
He's freaking out.

2020
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:23,320
He's having a nervous breakdown.
How close is that?

2021
01:33:23,321 --> 01:33:26,470
Then he finally shows up and just 
crushes you.

2022
01:33:26,471 --> 01:33:29,080
Watch that movie.
Now I'm sure there's some corniness from

2023
01:33:29,081 --> 01:33:30,430
enter the dragon and that's an old 
movie,

2024
01:33:30,431 --> 01:33:33,850
but there's so like a good 75 percent of
it just stands.

2025
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:35,500
The test of time.
The scenes,

2026
01:33:35,650 --> 01:33:40,650
the wet shot,
like when he's out with are out during 

2027
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:42,610
the day and he's those when he fights 
Bob Wall and Bolo Young,

2028
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:46,180
God dammit.
Those are the best fucking scenes.

2029
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:51,870
It was so intense like Muhammad Ali had 
come along before that that represented 

2030
01:33:52,571 --> 01:33:55,320
martial arts at all in a mainstream way.
There was no,

2031
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:57,550
there's been no one that grabbed the 
public's attention.

2032
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:59,770
He was the first and when he did pick 
bosses,

2033
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:01,690
first of all,
but he wasn't even the start first.

2034
01:34:01,691 --> 01:34:06,691
He was like built third or fourth and 
then he just started directing and 

2035
01:34:06,691 --> 01:34:10,351
fucking putting together the fight 
scenes and then they bumped them up and 

2036
01:34:10,351 --> 01:34:10,351
made them.
They go,

2037
01:34:10,351 --> 01:34:11,420
this motherfucker's just taken over.
This dude just start.

2038
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,140
They just throw them on the film,
you know,

2039
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:19,230
last minute.
And he took over and then from that 

2040
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:19,230
point on,
he just took a lot,

2041
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:22,180
which is one of my all time,
top five and when I get down and dirty,

2042
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:24,210
what am I,
old time movies as a child,

2043
01:34:24,211 --> 01:34:26,980
these connection which was released,
whatever the big boss here,

2044
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:31,960
fist of fury in that movie,
his fucking anger comes through.

2045
01:34:31,961 --> 01:34:33,850
I mean,
he's so good in that movie.

2046
01:34:33,851 --> 01:34:35,360
Everything he does,
he hang with.

2047
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:38,230
This guy took clint eastwood.
It took them a step further.

2048
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:43,440
He would kill the guys and then hang 
them on the streets so people could see 

2049
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,950
him.
That's nobody's done that shit.

2050
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:49,270
Nobody's ever thought Charles Bronson.
He hung up twice.

2051
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:50,950
You know,
why'd you kill my teacher?

2052
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:51,770
Why?
Why?

2053
01:34:51,771 --> 01:34:56,771
Why?
Think of that last fight scene where he 

2054
01:34:56,771 --> 01:34:58,190
goes to the school and he says,
this does not concern you.

2055
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:03,490
I'm allowing you to leave.
He throws them out and then three that 

2056
01:35:03,621 --> 01:35:06,320
stick around,
he jumps over a coffee table.

2057
01:35:06,321 --> 01:35:11,321
What's the movie?
Guys jumps over the coffee table into a 

2058
01:35:11,321 --> 01:35:11,390
flying psychic.
This ain't no joke.

2059
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:14,430
He beats the fat guy with the sword.
He puts them down to the store,

2060
01:35:14,470 --> 01:35:18,020
goes through his back.
Then he goes to the yard and he fucks up

2061
01:35:18,021 --> 01:35:20,090
two guys.
He fucks up the Russian.

2062
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:22,640
Then it goes into the studio with the 
new chancellor.

2063
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:27,660
Shit fucks the master up.
Then it goes back to the day to the 

2064
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:32,470
school.
He tells the cops not to fuck around 

2065
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:32,470
with his school and the cops are scared 
of him.

2066
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:34,790
He's talking to him and he's like,
if I go to jail,

2067
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:39,791
don't fuck with them.
Then he opens the door to open and 

2068
01:35:39,791 --> 01:35:41,480
there's a bunch of people outside ready 
to shoot him and he runs to the camera.

2069
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:44,890
He throws a flying psychic and you hear 
the fucking bullets go off in a year.

2070
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:49,220
That's what killed me as a kid,
not seeing my mother died that tormented

2071
01:35:49,221 --> 01:35:54,221
me when Bruce Lee got shot at the end of
the fist of fury because I didn't know 

2072
01:35:54,221 --> 01:35:57,131
where he come back or not,
but think about that fucking movie he's 

2073
01:35:57,131 --> 01:35:57,131
acting.
Coach was.

2074
01:35:57,131 --> 01:36:01,520
I quit Chinese connection.
Steve motherfucking mcqueen.

2075
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:03,980
Long Distance.
Do you understand me?

2076
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:06,490
He was calling Steve McQueen saying,
Doug,

2077
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:09,110
this is what I do doing this scene.
What do you think?

2078
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:15,270
Do you understand me?
Dog and him and Steve Mcqueen were 

2079
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:16,100
running together and they both wanted 
what each other had.

2080
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,860
Steve Mcqueen didn't want to be no star.
He didn't like people.

2081
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,870
He didn't want people talking to him.
Steve McQueen beat the fuck out.

2082
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:23,540
Ali Mcgraw and went to work the next 
day.

2083
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:26,150
Nobody gave a fuck.
He was a mean guy.

2084
01:36:26,151 --> 01:36:31,151
Steve McQueen.
He wanted to be a fighter and Bruce Lee 

2085
01:36:31,151 --> 01:36:32,360
wanted to be a fucking actor,
an international star.

2086
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:35,170
They both had what each other wanted,
bro.

2087
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,510
Steve Mcqueen,
just one of the pis on people.

2088
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,430
Fuck people from one time and said,
dog,

2089
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:42,650
let's take a ride.
This producer died.

2090
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:47,800
I'm going to go piss on his grave.
Like I told him when he fired me from 

2091
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:47,800
that movie.
Steve McQueen wasn't a nice guy.

2092
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,990
Wow.
When you die of cancer,

2093
01:36:51,950 --> 01:36:53,840
he went to Mexico and couldn't get 
healed.

2094
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:55,690
Breast Cancer,
breast cancer,

2095
01:36:56,660 --> 01:37:01,370
enter the dragon was so fucking strong 
like Bruce Lee was so amazing.

2096
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:08,050
They put out a pregnant,
put out the craziest thing about the 

2097
01:37:08,050 --> 01:37:10,871
whole Bruce Lee thing.
The craziest thing is that they put a 

2098
01:37:10,871 --> 01:37:10,871
movie out after he died,
game of death,

2099
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,220
and the only,
the last 10 minutes is him.

2100
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:15,740
They decided to make a movie with 75 
percent.

2101
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,440
Another dude.
It was another dude,

2102
01:37:18,490 --> 01:37:21,710
and if you watch that movie at the,
they put,

2103
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:25,640
they take pictures or scenes from return
of the Dragon.

2104
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:27,830
Stick an extent.
Although they mix it all up.

2105
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:32,240
The photo in the first five minutes of 
the movie,

2106
01:37:32,450 --> 01:37:36,740
they put a photo of Bruce Lee on a 
moving body on the double.

2107
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:38,030
Really?
They put a photo.

2108
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:41,690
It's the worst photoshop ever.
The beginning of that movie.

2109
01:37:41,691 --> 01:37:46,691
Then they shut the whole rest of the 
movie with like anytime you get a good 

2110
01:37:46,691 --> 01:37:47,690
look at Bruce Lee.
It's another movie.

2111
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:52,190
It's another fucking movie man,
and then they cut back and then when you

2112
01:37:52,191 --> 01:37:55,160
see the profile,
it's a stunt double with glasses.

2113
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:58,740
Fucking glasses though.
They had a stunt double for Kareem Abdul

2114
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:03,740
Jabbar too because they had to have an 
excuse for him at the end of the movie 

2115
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:03,740
when he actually does come in.
So if you watch the movie,

2116
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:05,190
you see the big tall black guy is that 
even crew,

2117
01:38:05,191 --> 01:38:06,900
but you know he's going to fight them at
the end,

2118
01:38:06,990 --> 01:38:10,500
but people talk about the seven wonders 
of the world or Grand Canyon.

2119
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:13,580
Know what the eighth wonder of the world
is that they seek old.

2120
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:14,820
That movie.
Eighteen Times.

2121
01:38:14,821 --> 01:38:17,100
We've had this conversation with how 
you're doing.

2122
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:18,750
We're here today,
Eddie Bravo.

2123
01:38:18,751 --> 01:38:23,751
Joe Rogan.
You'd like to speak to you about a 

2124
01:38:23,751 --> 01:38:23,751
pitch.
Oh,

2125
01:38:23,751 --> 01:38:24,390
we're all is.
We'd like to do game a death three.

2126
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:24,970
You know what I'm saying?

2127
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:29,180
Isn't Bruce Lee debt?
We don't need Bruce Lee.

2128
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:34,190
You understand?
To break the pictures down to show 

2129
01:38:34,190 --> 01:38:37,611
pictures and shit.
So how much are we going to make a 

2130
01:38:37,611 --> 01:38:37,611
that's not gonna.
Make any money.

2131
01:38:37,611 --> 01:38:40,610
What boxes are fucking how much the 
game.

2132
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:45,680
That's why I like to see it.
They don't even have what those movies 

2133
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:46,060
made.
You can't.

2134
01:38:46,061 --> 01:38:51,061
No.
You can look up any movie on white pity 

2135
01:38:51,061 --> 01:38:51,061
and see what they made.

2136
01:38:51,061 --> 01:38:54,920
Whatever the fuck it is.
I still got it.

2137
01:38:54,921 --> 01:38:55,990
You know,
white people.

2138
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:01,480
What about the whole forget about game 
of death and using a fake Bruce Lee for 

2139
01:39:01,631 --> 01:39:06,631
most of the movie,
the worst editing ever for the editing 

2140
01:39:06,631 --> 01:39:09,010
shit.
But how about the like bruce lie.

2141
01:39:09,130 --> 01:39:14,130
And then there was like a bruce at Lou 
that all these total rip offs of Bruce 

2142
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:14,740
Lee.
They just went with it.

2143
01:39:14,890 --> 01:39:16,960
It was like kiss kiss.
Now they got,

2144
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:19,660
they got a for Lee's makeup.
Peter Chris's makeup,

2145
01:39:19,690 --> 01:39:22,120
but they call him Tommy Thayer and Eric 
Singer.

2146
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:24,810
But they got a saint Peter's makeup.
It's incredible.

2147
01:39:24,811 --> 01:39:27,810
Asians were so hot back then.
That's like a certain dose escalation.

2148
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:30,280
But the kiss,
no one's ever pulled it off like kiss.

2149
01:39:30,281 --> 01:39:35,281
Did Kagan dudes wear the same makeup?
The guys who they're replacing first.

2150
01:39:37,830 --> 01:39:40,390
I didn't do that now.
At first when they first last ace,

2151
01:39:40,630 --> 01:39:43,420
they got vinny events and he came out as
an Egyptian.

2152
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,520
He was.
And then when they lost Peter,

2153
01:39:46,090 --> 01:39:49,990
Eric Carr came in as the Fox.
So when they decided to do the reunion,

2154
01:39:49,991 --> 01:39:54,991
they get ace and Peter Back.
Once they start leaving again in the 

2155
01:39:54,991 --> 01:39:57,511
exact same order,
a slept first and then peter the exact 

2156
01:39:57,511 --> 01:39:57,511
same thing.
They go,

2157
01:39:57,511 --> 01:40:01,051
fuck it.
Let's not start any new characters as 

2158
01:40:01,051 --> 01:40:01,750
keep the old characters with.
Just have different dudes plan.

2159
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:04,270
So Jesus was always like,
Jean was always like,

2160
01:40:04,271 --> 01:40:05,920
no drugs,
no alcohol,

2161
01:40:05,921 --> 01:40:06,430
no,
no,

2162
01:40:06,431 --> 01:40:08,560
nothing.
Was Paul Stanley a partier?

2163
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:09,820
No,
not both of them.

2164
01:40:09,821 --> 01:40:14,821
So both of them didn't party,
but the other dudes really party like a 

2165
01:40:14,821 --> 01:40:15,190
motherfucker.
So Peter,

2166
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:15,750
Chris,
right?

2167
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:16,810
Massive.
Yes.

2168
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:17,380
Peter.
Chris,

2169
01:40:17,390 --> 01:40:20,200
I think was an alcoholic at ace had a 
coke problem.

2170
01:40:20,490 --> 01:40:21,290
She,
Samson,

2171
01:40:21,710 --> 01:40:24,070
you can't play guitar like down unless 
you do a little coke.

2172
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:24,650
Exactly.

2173
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,580
Gene Simmons,
family jewels.

2174
01:40:27,581 --> 01:40:29,440
The new season last night.
Wow.

2175
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:32,890
They got a new skulk for his hair.
You have to see it.

2176
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:34,750
Yeah.
They got a new scarf.

2177
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:38,110
He's got like two inches.
Tyler.

2178
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:43,960
He's always had the gene.
Simmons will never be hosting a show 

2179
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:47,690
about hurricanes.
You're.

2180
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:50,310
The crazy thing too,
is,

2181
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:50,740
um,

2182
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:53,980
going to be wearing a

2183
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,650
motorcycle helmet.
They know.

2184
01:40:57,651 --> 01:41:00,210
Kiss knows the biggest kiss fan on the 
planet.

2185
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,170
So are you.
Kiss knows that.

2186
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:07,320
You know what?
Most of the people now that are getting 

2187
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:07,320
into kiss,
they won't even know that.

2188
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:08,330
That's not a severely.
And they'll go there.

2189
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,450
The cap,
the fucking spaceman.

2190
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,860
That's more important than their actual 
fucking names like that.

2191
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:15,520
It is.
As long as they can reproduce the songs,

2192
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:20,660
you just can't have the songs at Ace 
because ace had a very distinctive 

2193
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:20,660
voice.
Yeah,

2194
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:20,860
I liked his voice,
man.

2195
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:23,440
I liked these freely and Peter had a 
great voice too,

2196
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:28,650
but both of them can sing.
Eric singer is a really good singer and 

2197
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:28,650
he's really good at imitating Peter 
Criss.

2198
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:31,660
He really is.
Sound like that song [inaudible] man.

2199
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:32,740
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.

2200
01:41:32,770 --> 01:41:34,760
Dynasty.
Nineteen 79 son.

2201
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:39,700
Site to track too.
Right after I was made for loving.

2202
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:43,850
Powerful.
That's another ace.

2203
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:46,470
Didn't even write that song.
The producer wrote that one or so.

2204
01:41:46,490 --> 01:41:47,620
That was a cover.
Two thousand pounds.

2205
01:41:47,621 --> 01:41:49,180
An actual old cover.
I'd love.

2206
01:41:49,181 --> 01:41:51,630
I was made for loving you.
Give me some.

2207
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,760
I was made for loving.
You find that shit.

2208
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Shit.
Typical remix that was made for loving 

2209
01:41:59,000 --> 01:41:59,850
you in tough fucking house song.
It sounds awesome.

2210
01:41:59,870 --> 01:42:03,330
Three big tech.
Oh my God.

2211
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:06,580
What a great idea.
That's a jam.

2212
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:09,250
That was a disco song.
That's gone disco,

2213
01:42:09,251 --> 01:42:11,260
but it was good.
That was good.

2214
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:14,480
Disco Heavens

2215
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:15,530
on fire.
Everybody.

2216
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:18,030
That's loud.
I was like,

2217
01:42:18,650 --> 01:42:19,690
we don't want to go live.

2218
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:21,650
Sound like shit.
Can't be alive,

2219
01:42:21,651 --> 01:42:22,300
son.
Yeah,

2220
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:24,280
go with the other video.
You go youtube there.

2221
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:31,820
Let's go.
Fuck it.

2222
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:38,810
Fuck yeah.
How many guys who were following him on 

2223
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:45,710
that?
You guys were blowing him off.

2224
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:51,940
He didn't want to go there.
Want to start going there?

2225
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:55,040
I think,
but without going further.

2226
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:58,200
I think that's the reason why Paul and 
Jamie for such a great team,

2227
01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:01,620
I think it's because of.
Because of what?

2228
01:43:01,630 --> 01:43:03,510
That could do.
Some guns and roses.

2229
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:07,830
If you guys.
No one knows what the fuck we're talking

2230
01:43:07,831 --> 01:43:10,350
about.
Guns and roses accused him of what?

2231
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:14,420
Love.
God.

2232
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:15,930
Damn.
You're hot.

2233
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:17,130
We can't even.
We can't even go there.

2234
01:43:17,131 --> 01:43:18,660
I don't want to go there.
All right.

2235
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:21,660
Sorry.
I'm a big kiss fan.

2236
01:43:21,690 --> 01:43:22,410
What?
Okay.

2237
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:24,810
No need to disparage them.
Yes.

2238
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:30,090
Paul Stanley is one of my gods for sure.
And by the way,

2239
01:43:30,091 --> 01:43:32,300
he's freely as clean and sober now.
Really?

2240
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:35,070
It Paul Stanley was gay.
I'd love him even more.

2241
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:37,230
Who Cares?
Yeah.

2242
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:39,690
I hope you got some good.
I Love Rob Halford.

2243
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,990
I love rob from Queens.
Fucking Freddie Mercury was awesome.

2244
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:49,330
Awesome.
I love to click and I don't like no.

2245
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:52,580
Ricky Martin.
I don't like him to down.

2246
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:53,080
Nah.

2247
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:59,590
What about other gay singers?
Nelson is Elton John's a bad 

2248
01:43:59,590 --> 01:43:59,590
motherfucker.
Motherfucker.

2249
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:01,010
Come on.
John's a bad motherfucker.

2250
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:02,320
One tiny dancer.
Come on,

2251
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:03,340
come on.
Come on.

2252
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:06,170
Come on man.
You a great gym.

2253
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:07,850
I don't care if he's George.
Michael.

2254
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,550
Freedom by George Michael.
Oh Shit.

2255
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:16,030
Shit.
Shit.

2256
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:21,200
Hearts to that saw this poor different 
parts.

2257
01:44:21,201 --> 01:44:24,410
It's not just the person cause it's 
verse fucking secondary.

2258
01:44:24,411 --> 01:44:27,980
Bruce pre course and course for 
different parts and they're all awesome.

2259
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:33,010
And the video with all those hot models,
all the hot models are singing and 

2260
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:36,731
dancing along and as long as he doesn't 
look at me in the eye when he thinks 

2261
01:44:36,731 --> 01:44:37,700
that I'll go to a concert,
I want to be like,

2262
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:42,770
you're right in the eyes.
He's sagging and a spell on that would 

2263
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:43,010
be different.
I would say a legacy.

2264
01:44:43,011 --> 01:44:44,600
If it's like Joey Diaz,
his joke,

2265
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:50,260
George Michael could put a spell on me.
He pulled a diamond encrusted Dick 

2266
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:51,230
starts hiplet.
Seriously though,

2267
01:44:51,231 --> 01:44:52,430
Dude.
If you went to go see George,

2268
01:44:52,431 --> 01:44:55,060
Michael was playing and after parties 
playing Dana White's fucking party,

2269
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:56,090
whatever.
And he starts singing them.

2270
01:44:56,091 --> 01:44:59,060
Looking directly in the eye with you of 
like started texting.

2271
01:44:59,061 --> 01:44:59,130
Okay.

2272
01:45:01,090 --> 01:45:04,170
Facebook I might try to do with Joey 
Diaz would do them.

2273
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:09,180
Blue Ball.
I get arrested again lately.

2274
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:23,200
That's got to be the only thing that 
turns them on at this point.

2275
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:25,050
That's a secret shit.
Who wants to start?

2276
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,280
We make the video and make it a straight
gay.

2277
01:45:35,281 --> 01:45:37,080
Just be real.
This next album.

2278
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:39,840
I just want to come.
This is perfect.

2279
01:45:39,841 --> 01:45:41,480
Thank you for real.
This shit.

2280
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:46,940
He's good at this.
I'm just surprised my Gaydar did not 

2281
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:49,080
work as a child because he bought this 
like cd for my birthday.

2282
01:45:49,170 --> 01:45:51,030
His gaydar was not.
Not on.

2283
01:45:51,150 --> 01:45:56,150
Maybe as Keto was dead on it.
He thought that you were gay and trying 

2284
01:45:56,150 --> 01:45:57,770
to test you out.
Kelly.

2285
01:45:58,350 --> 01:46:03,120
Joe.
Michael.

2286
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:08,590
Yeah.
We haven't even got to the right after 

2287
01:46:10,441 --> 01:46:10,770
this

2288
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:21,680
music.
There's no argument.

2289
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:39,900
This is not.
This is the ship.

2290
01:47:39,901 --> 01:47:44,901
That yellow heavy music.
Like a real grind court death metal.

2291
01:47:46,930 --> 01:47:48,320
This.
I understand that there.

2292
01:47:48,530 --> 01:47:50,610
Keep it playing in the background with 
all the guys.

2293
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:52,170
Fuck it.
Just give us a little background.

2294
01:47:52,171 --> 01:47:55,320
I'll be honest.
This is a good fucking jam.

2295
01:47:55,930 --> 01:47:57,780
Yeah.
I like some fruity shit man.

2296
01:47:57,781 --> 01:47:59,410
I do.
I a lot of fruity shit.

2297
01:48:00,070 --> 01:48:02,720
Like that billionaire song I like.
Um,

2298
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:07,940
I liked that Katy Perry Song,
California girls that some fruity shit 

2299
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:12,180
cow.
But the fact that I would like it pop 

2300
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:17,550
music like some don't like a lot.
Pop music's good because it gets.

2301
01:48:17,551 --> 01:48:18,780
Once it gets into your head,
it's good.

2302
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:21,780
Quickly.
That eminem song with Brianna,

2303
01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:26,580
I listening to her saying her parts 
parts alerts too much.

2304
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:30,520
Fucking these goddamn sense.
I love it when you lie.

2305
01:48:30,530 --> 01:48:32,420
Who the fuck loves it when you lie?

2306
01:48:32,490 --> 01:48:34,470
Everyone hates that shit.
I don't get the lyrics.

2307
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,950
I just love her voice.
I just want to liberalize this.

2308
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:42,070
Awesome.
Riata is definitely one of my peers.

2309
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:47,250
Something terrible thing to say.
There's something extra sexy about her 

2310
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:52,150
and there's something extra attractive 
but her that she got her ass kicked by 

2311
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:53,970
that too.
I don't know why there's something about

2312
01:48:53,971 --> 01:48:58,140
her that she's been through some shit.
Now I can understand this pain.

2313
01:48:58,230 --> 01:49:00,030
This is the legit.
Okay.

2314
01:49:00,031 --> 01:49:01,450
This girl's crying.
She is crying.

2315
01:49:01,451 --> 01:49:02,190
I man,
she loved.

2316
01:49:02,191 --> 01:49:04,230
Beat the fuck out of her and the whole 
world knows about it.

2317
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,490
She's,
she's allowed to be in pain.

2318
01:49:06,491 --> 01:49:09,000
She's allowed to be twisted.
She's allowed to cry.

2319
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:12,420
And you know,
it's like when Tupac went to jail,

2320
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:17,720
he came out better than ever.
Painful songs,

2321
01:49:23,401 --> 01:49:26,040
better than anybody.
I didn't even know she got beat up.

2322
01:49:26,041 --> 01:49:30,370
How sad is knows that when I first heard
before,

2323
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:32,270
it was huge.
I don't even like rnb.

2324
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:37,280
When I heard that song,
I knew it was going to be fucking 

2325
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,490
whatever the fuck that is.
That is a great song.

2326
01:49:38,491 --> 01:49:43,491
And then it blew the fuck up because 
basically you pull the vocals out of 

2327
01:49:43,491 --> 01:49:43,500
umbrella.
That could be something.

2328
01:49:43,930 --> 01:49:47,620
That could be anything.
It's alternative music with an RNB chick

2329
01:49:47,621 --> 01:49:47,970
over it

2330
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:50,560
with a hip hop drum beat.
It's fucking perfect.

2331
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:59,730
Music man doesn't even make any sense.
Fucking believe.

2332
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:01,570
It doesn't make any sense.
How much impact?

2333
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:04,980
Just a bunch of frequencies.
People talking and you know,

2334
01:50:05,610 --> 01:50:08,380
and the songs frequency.
Does it resonate with yours?

2335
01:50:08,381 --> 01:50:10,150
That's all.
It's real simple science.

2336
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:12,670
So amazing though.
It's amazing that something like that is

2337
01:50:12,671 --> 01:50:13,600
real.
You know,

2338
01:50:13,601 --> 01:50:15,010
that people don't respect it.
I mean,

2339
01:50:15,011 --> 01:50:17,020
when you get really baked and you start 
thinking about music,

2340
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:22,230
people don't smell pot.
They don't even know what music sounds 

2341
01:50:22,230 --> 01:50:22,230
like.
You don't.

2342
01:50:22,230 --> 01:50:23,290
You really don't,
you actually don't.

2343
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,750
You're missing like a,
like about 30 percent of it.

2344
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:28,570
You're missing some,
some extra layers that you wouldn't even

2345
01:50:28,571 --> 01:50:33,571
see her here.
Try listening to a seal when your baked 

2346
01:50:33,571 --> 01:50:38,490
seal.
That song by a road was a big seal fan 

2347
01:50:38,490 --> 01:50:39,490
back in the day.
Listen to that shit with some headphones

2348
01:50:39,491 --> 01:50:40,450
on when your baked.

2349
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:43,420
There's like symbols out here.
You know what I'm saying?

2350
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,900
Like the sounds so well engineered and 
crafted,

2351
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,090
you know,
it all flows together.

2352
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:54,300
That dude was a bad motherfucker.
He was a bad motherfucker done with some

2353
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:57,100
other shit that I didn't like.
Embedded to people that are like seal.

2354
01:50:57,610 --> 01:51:02,610
I like to seal.
Second album was for first two albums 

2355
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:02,610
were good man.
Crazy.

2356
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:03,070
He was on the first album.
Oh he was brave.

2357
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:04,510
And that second album,
man,

2358
01:51:04,511 --> 01:51:07,030
that's like six,
seven really good songs on that.

2359
01:51:07,031 --> 01:51:12,031
The quality is shit.
I'll tell you what I listened to 

2360
01:51:12,031 --> 01:51:12,031
yesterday the first time.
Unbelievable shot day.

2361
01:51:12,031 --> 01:51:12,910
Yeah.
Oh classic.

2362
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,880
Oh the first two albums are the ones she
did for the movie.

2363
01:51:15,881 --> 01:51:18,530
When the guy bought the million dollars 
the guy gave,

2364
01:51:18,930 --> 01:51:21,610
that'd be more of a million dollars when
she's rolling around the money.

2365
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:25,390
What's that song gave you love?
I don't remember.

2366
01:51:25,391 --> 01:51:28,030
That was a bad motherfucker.
I love chicks.

2367
01:51:28,230 --> 01:51:29,370
Oh,
we should sing.

2368
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:31,540
That's my favorite and my favorite shit 
to listen to.

2369
01:51:31,570 --> 01:51:33,580
My favorite all time.
Sarah Mclaughlin.

2370
01:51:33,590 --> 01:51:35,160
She just crushes everybody,
man.

2371
01:51:35,161 --> 01:51:40,161
She does.
But forget about sheryl crow has a 

2372
01:51:40,161 --> 01:51:43,381
different element or fumbling towards 
ecstasy by Sarah Mclaughlin.

2373
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:50,160
Get that motherfucker the whole fucking 
owl crimes of passion by Pat Pat.

2374
01:51:54,150 --> 01:51:56,900
Better time.
Passion.

2375
01:51:57,200 --> 01:52:00,130
Husband was fucking killing that guitar.
Crimes of passion.

2376
01:52:00,270 --> 01:52:02,860
That's a great jam.
Sheryl Crow and kid rock.

2377
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:05,400
That fucking song.
That song we did together.

2378
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,280
What does that woke up?

2379
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:11,320
What is it?
What is the name of that song?

2380
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:13,540
It's her voice in that.
In that song.

2381
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:17,590
Her voice in that song is so good.
What about the fucking check for missing

2382
01:52:17,591 --> 01:52:18,520
persons?
Man,

2383
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:23,790
remember Terry Bozzio played that.
That kid rock and show that way.

2384
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:26,660
I just want to hear her.
Okay.

2385
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:30,610
Keep going.
Live son.

2386
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:37,640
Live here.
The first one's favorite singer in the 

2387
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:41,760
towns.
I like her way last because that 

2388
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:45,130
interview introduction rather broke

2389
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:47,600
very much Mr Kidd rock.

2390
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:50,730
Who said that?
It looked like Pamela Anderson.

2391
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:51,780
Oh,
that's what it is.

2392
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:57,640
People can watch.
That was a smart thing.

2393
01:52:57,641 --> 01:53:02,641
You did a little slow.
His part is cool because I like some 

2394
01:53:05,711 --> 01:53:07,810
country music and I think this is kind 
of interesting.

2395
01:53:08,110 --> 01:53:09,640
A man.
When that bitch starts singing,

2396
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:12,550
it makes me want to curl up in a fetal 
position and take a nap.

2397
01:53:13,790 --> 01:53:18,790
I want to go back to the womb.
It just makes me like be a little more 

2398
01:53:27,370 --> 01:53:32,370
of that.
It sounds like a country rock star for 

2399
01:53:37,421 --> 01:53:42,421
years.
He does a lot of songs like that last 

2400
01:53:42,421 --> 01:53:45,931
album was holding all country.
He's a bad motherfucker that Eddie John 

2401
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:52,270
his shit,
man.

2402
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:55,360
I liked his country music,
but here's.

2403
01:53:55,390 --> 01:54:00,390
Here's what gets you to come on Sheryl,
because this an original song or a 

2404
01:54:03,671 --> 01:54:05,410
cover.
I think it's an original song,

2405
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,850
but I don't know.
I could be wrong.

2406
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:12,030
It could be some shift from the fort.
Is Kid rock road getting real powerful 

2407
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:19,290
kid rock.
I love her voice.

2408
01:54:42,510 --> 01:54:42,830
No,

2409
01:54:46,190 --> 01:54:51,190
we're watching.
Chick's got a soft spot for show girls 

2410
01:54:51,190 --> 01:54:52,320
rather pissed off people out there right
now.

2411
01:54:56,930 --> 01:55:01,030
Let's take it back to.
We need a balance.

2412
01:55:01,150 --> 01:55:03,770
You need to put the slayer.
Two

2413
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:04,580
bars.
It's a.

2414
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:06,030
it's not a good version of it.
Anyway,

2415
01:55:06,031 --> 01:55:09,150
man.
Studio Angel of death on really quick.

2416
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:11,970
Fucking voice is so awesome.
But if you guys should keep going.

2417
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,760
No,
we're get to done for 20.

2418
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:17,190
Get outta here.
Best time to end for 20.

2419
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:19,170
We're sorry we subject you to that 
music,

2420
01:55:19,171 --> 01:55:22,200
but we smoked marijuana.
That sounded really awesome to us.

2421
01:55:22,530 --> 01:55:27,530
And uh,
we thought it would have been a fun 

2422
01:55:27,530 --> 01:55:27,530
thing to do.
I still love Sheryl Crow's music.

2423
01:55:27,530 --> 01:55:31,230
Saw about the fuck are you a carcass?
And I like nods to sun and much respect 

2424
01:55:31,981 --> 01:55:36,981
to the fleshlight fleshlight.com.
Or go to Joe's website and click on 

2425
01:55:36,981 --> 01:55:40,311
fleshlight for two.
If you get 50 percent much respect to 

2426
01:55:40,311 --> 01:55:40,311

master of music producer,
you can catch him.

2428
01:55:41,191 --> 01:55:45,900

Much respect to mad on twitter,

2429
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:49,530
but twitter on twitter,
that's a twisted sister.

2430
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:52,050
That's his nickname is the twister.
Eddie Bravo on twitter.

2431
01:55:52,051 --> 01:55:57,051
And you find my mind space.
You still rocking mindspace I go there 

2432
01:55:57,051 --> 01:56:00,000
once every 10 days.
I got friends,

2433
01:56:00,001 --> 01:56:02,220
you know,
so many profiles have been deleted.

2434
01:56:02,221 --> 01:56:03,690
So my top friends are like,

2435
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:05,290

And they're like,

2436
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:06,170

2439
01:56:12,091 --> 01:56:17,091
You just feel compelled to follow in the
abandoning my space even though it 

2440
01:56:17,091 --> 01:56:18,720
helped me quite a bit.
Soon as Jodie Fox left our pal Jordy who

2441
01:56:18,721 --> 01:56:20,280
worked over there as soon as God would 
often like,

2442
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:20,970
all right,
I'm done.

2443
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,710
Well,
I send people people that want to listen

2444
01:56:22,711 --> 01:56:24,330
to my music.
My music videos are up there.

2445

They're not on facebook.
So if you want to check out my music,

twister.

2447
01:56:29,251 --> 01:56:30,660
Why don't you have a section of your 
website?

2448
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:32,120
That's what it's about to.
Well,

2449
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:32,850
not to do it.
It's not.

2450
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:36,000
The new website will drop in about a 
week or two.

2451
01:56:36,001 --> 01:56:41,001
I got the new website going up.

we've never been there.

2456
01:56:46,471 --> 01:56:51,010
It's an old school rock and roll barn 
out in the middle of fucking a gore.

2457
01:56:51,050 --> 01:56:53,040
It's the Shit Ted nugent's there next
