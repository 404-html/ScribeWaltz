1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,560
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,760
Is there a a point where you think,

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,091
like,

4
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:07,320
if you look at like your career,

5
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:08,460
like if you look at your future,

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,421
if you like,

7
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:09,891
will you be,

8
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:10,261
you say,

9
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:10,560
okay,

10
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,700
for if I get to this point

11
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,620
done?

12
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,200
No,

13
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,590
no,

14
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,000
no.

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,410
You can do it until you enjoy it.

16
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,720
While I stopped enjoying it for years,

17
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,120
I fucking hate it for four years,

18
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,340
four,

19
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,970
five years when I start gambling.

20
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,213
Um,

21
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,030
and then I wouldn't admit I hate it.

22
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,360
I'd have like little spells
where I would be like,

23
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,783
I can't do it anymore.

24
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,040
I don't want to,

25
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,890
the pressure,

26
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:35,450
the fucking head fuck of it,

27
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:36,830
all the this,

28
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:39,040
and then when I get my money
and money gambling it all,

29
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,180
I just,

30
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,013
uh,

31
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,841
you know,

32
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:42,674
I mean,

33
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,410
I can't do it anymore and I can't keep
bringing myself back up like Kimball,

34
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,240
which might be a big comeback,

35
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,113
uh,

36
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,300
[inaudible],

37
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,240
you know,

38
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,073
keep it going.

39
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,010
Do,

40
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,650
you know,

41
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,510
bought a bean,

42
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,290
that ball it.

43
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,970
Just a lot of bad decisions
and so by me as well,

44
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,200
but not just fortunately,

45
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,730
not just bad decisions,

46
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,420
just bad results.

47
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,190
Well,

48
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,300
but results of some caused by me and some,

49
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,240
some just bad decisions to do.

50
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,150
I mean it's not just,

51
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:13,310
yeah,

52
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,170
the Kimble fight was seen by
how many people that must be,

53
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,510
there was a huge audience.

54
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,344
Right.

55
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,740
8 million people are thinking of fancy.

56
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,531
A six or eight.

57
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:22,364
I can't remember.

58
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,050
I know most people,

59
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,740
what they remember is that you came into
the cage with a fucking mouse living in

60
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:28,574
your hair.

61
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,110
You gotta like a whole
mouse family and it blew up.

62
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:33,850
Right.

63
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,340
And you popped in the middle of the fight.

64
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,190
It was so hard to watch.

65
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:39,500
That was the most fucked up ear ever seen.

66
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:40,490
I'm national TV.

67
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,840
No one had a more fucked up here.

68
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,450
My is from a famous I man,

69
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,293
I'm jealous.

70
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,173
Jealous on my end.

71
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,320
We'll talk about that fight when we
heard that guy that fuck Kimbo what the

72
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,430
crazy fucking ear.

73
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,420
Oh Shit.

74
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,943
Colossus.

75
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,600
I'm not going to be remembered.

76
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:55,070
Fall out though for that.

77
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:55,963
No.

78
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,511
You'll,

79
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:59,330
you'll be remembered for
your entire career of sure.

80
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,710
No,

81
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,543
what I'm saying,

82
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,570
what I'm saying is out the moment.

83
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,550
Remember?

84
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:03,701
Yeah.

85
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:06,730
I thought at the moment people would say,

86
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,133
I'm the Kimball.

87
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,050
You know what I remember,

88
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,150
I remember he had Kimbo in side
control and he stood you up.

89
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,810
Yeah,

90
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,250
yeah,

91
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:13,500
yeah.

92
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:13,911
You know,

93
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:14,780
I remember that.

94
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,003
Right.

95
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,590
Nobody ever points type.

96
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,770
I always say,

97
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,170
I mean,

98
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,050
I take a lot of mold.

99
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,690
Watch the fucking pizza.

100
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,440
You don't stands a guy up
when the guy and I just,

101
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,073
yeah,

102
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:27,900
a lead x.

103
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,930
He was a corrupt organization.

104
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,460
Corrupt one of them.

105
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,380
They changed the rules.

106
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,930
They told guys to stand up and bang.

107
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,250
They told guys stand up and bang.

108
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,820
They gave them instructions and they made,

109
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:43,310
they made the referee
stand guys up much earlier.

110
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,710
Big country was fighting Andrea
[inaudible] and had him in a fucking side

111
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:52,040
control position and work in a
Kamora and they stood in back up.

112
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,701
I'm like,

113
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:54,500
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

114
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,800
Jake shields as they did that same
shit when he was fighting Paul,

115
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,310
um,

116
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,210
uh,

117
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,360
Semtex when he's fighting Paul Daley,

118
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,141
same shit.

119
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,250
They tried to stand them up early,

120
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,480
but Jake just attack,

121
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:04,811
attack,

122
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,280
attack and got him in an arm bar.

123
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:06,970
He just went,

124
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,290
Jake's high level black belt.

125
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,730
So he just went after it really quickly.

126
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,880
But you had Kimbo in fucking side control.

127
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:13,870
You work to get it.

128
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:14,331
You got it.

129
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:15,520
You were a dominant position.

130
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,050
He was tired and they
stood you back up bitches.

131
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,400
We did a radio interview,

132
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,030
you know,

133
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,940
everyone's on the other line
and just finished training.

134
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:27,774
So I'm on the phone,

135
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,370
I want to,

136
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,240
no one was asking me
fucking any questions.

137
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,373
Um,

138
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,160
and I thought,

139
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,401
yeah,

140
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:34,980
I'm just the Guy Kimbo to be so,

141
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,830
and then someone has to go short question.

142
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,430
They said,

143
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,263
um,

144
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,930
this is how he was holding the phone.

145
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,243
Um,

146
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:41,840
the Africa each,

147
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,673
all the questions.

148
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,751
I just,

149
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:44,250
uh,

150
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,110
I did have to say,

151
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:46,740
so just in case you can visualize it.

152
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,210
And they said to him,

153
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,520
what would you do with James Thompson won?

154
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,240
And he said,

155
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,140
I'd hung myself.

156
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,513
And I thought,

157
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,430
wow,

158
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,300
that's the dumbest motherfucker
in the history of MMA productions.

159
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,540
The,

160
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,760
the idea that you have one guy that's
the most important thing and bank

161
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,400
everything on him winning so stupid.

162
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:08,690
Oh,

163
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,080
eggs.

164
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,280
Culturally domino.

165
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,330
Because if you kicked that guy's ass,

166
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:14,130
it would have been awesome.

167
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,400
If they left you in side
control would have been awesome.

168
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,590
Just like it was awesome
for him when he won.

169
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,720
It would have been awesome for you then.

170
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,560
You know,

171
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,400
you got to let the guy who's supposed
to win win when you're trying to just be

172
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:27,540
the most marketable.

173
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,550
You're like looking for
the most marketable guy.

174
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,990
You'd never going to have a
legit organization organization.

175
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,500
This whole organization was,

176
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,510
it was essentially a corrupt organization.

177
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,260
That's,

178
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,190
that's what that is.

179
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,443
Um,

180
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,530
I'm writing a book at the
moment because the blogs,

181
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:43,400
I've gone so well.

182
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,140
I felt to himself,

183
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,143
I'll call it fucking,

184
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,300
I looked beside looking back
at the different stories,

185
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,350
kind of take the federal drinking
water and everyone loved it.

186
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:52,760
And a few more.

187
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,511
So I started thinking,

188
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:54,300
I've got fucking

189
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,641
that,

190
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:59,520
that elite Exede stories are
very important story from
martial arts because that

191
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:00,450
made me angry.

192
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,280
I was watching that at
home and I was angry.

193
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:02,551
I was like,

194
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:03,211
this is crazy.

195
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:04,250
And I love Kimbo.

196
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,330
I think he's an awesome guy.

197
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,780
He's a great character.

198
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:08,070
I like watching him fight.

199
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,530
He won a boxing match recently.

200
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:11,820
He's been winning a lot of boxing matches.

201
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,663
I love that dude.

202
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,940
It's not that I wanted
him to win or you to win,

203
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,350
but I wanted fairness.

204
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,920
And you worked hard to get
to that position and you
were in a dominant position

205
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:22,890
and they stood you back up and you were
fucking tired and you've got cracked.

206
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,110
And they did the same thing with big
country when big country had our Lawsky

207
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:27,870
down.

208
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,570
He was working for a fucking
Komora and they stood him up.

209
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:30,811
I'm like,

210
00:05:30,811 --> 00:05:32,370
are you crazy?

211
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:33,204
It was quite ironic.

212
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,040
Um,

213
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,780
I watched a big country.

214
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,320
I mean,

215
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,520
he was almost in exactly the same position
as me when he beat Kimball on the,

216
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,693
yeah.

217
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,313
Uh,

218
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,203
you know,

219
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,620
Kinda not mentioned or no,

220
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,520
very close to the same position,

221
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:47,911
you know what I mean?

222
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:49,350
The only difference is he
went with the mountain.

223
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,280
He had a full amount of crucifixions by,

224
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,700
you know,

225
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,610
which I'm sure you could
have worked towards.

226
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,690
You had him on his back.

227
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:55,920
He was only going to get more tired.

228
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:56,940
There was a couple minutes to go

229
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,230
[inaudible] without Phi.

230
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,083
It's not that.

231
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,060
I think they should have stopped the
fight because he came back and he,

232
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:02,250
yeah,

233
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,350
and he was atomy rocked
in the third round.

234
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:06,070
He barely fucking up them,

235
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:06,670
uh,

236
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,503
punches.

237
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,460
And I was,

238
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,141
I was rocked.

239
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:09,974
So it's not bad,

240
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,650
but they should have said,

241
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,750
you might knock me out.

242
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,883
I don't know.

243
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,773
I know man.

244
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,380
I took him down.

245
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,493
Right.

246
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,560
I don't know what a warm right.

247
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,251
That's a fucking,

248
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:21,330
the point of the fight.

249
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,460
You've got to let the fight conclude.

250
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,510
He could've knocked me out.

251
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,171
Make,

252
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:25,680
cause I was,

253
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,560
I was at one more tape down and he,

254
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,433
and he was mine.

255
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:28,711
Well,

256
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:32,850
you take such a good shot and you take
so many shots that sometimes people don't

257
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:33,810
know what the fuck to do.

258
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,100
And I think a fight like that,

259
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:38,520
like you took some bombs from
Timbo and you were still there.

260
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,960
And it's like the referees like,

261
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:40,231
man,

262
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:41,580
do I rescue this fucking guy?

263
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,500
It's a weird judgment call.

264
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:47,580
And it's very important to have the
right referee in a situation like that.

265
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:48,960
Like a guy like herb dean,

266
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,830
he'll,

267
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,910
he'll let you fight,

268
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,340
he'll let you fight if he,

269
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,230
but he will save you if
he knows you're fucked,

270
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,921
you know?

271
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:56,291
And that,

272
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,850
that I think there's a lot of fights
where the referee errs on the side of

273
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:01,530
caution and protects the fighter.

274
00:07:01,531 --> 00:07:03,300
And in a case like yours,

275
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:05,550
you feel like you were denied
an opportunity because of that.

276
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:05,721
Right?

277
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:05,950
Right.

278
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,783
Yeah.

279
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,790
Well what I was saying before,

280
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,140
so I was I van Berlin,

281
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,353
but the,

282
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,730
I was backstage and it just happened on
a gallery show sharks on that fucking a

283
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,993
big cheer.

284
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,690
Scala as though they call them.

285
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,330
Oh yeah.

286
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:21,870
Scholar.

287
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,470
What seems like a nice
guy with a fucking motel.

288
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,210
Dolla sign.

289
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,470
Fucking yeah.

290
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,980
Is a chain of dog sign chain.

291
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,030
Ah,

292
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,151
oh,

293
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:31,680
the ss a scholar.

294
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:31,950
Yeah.

295
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,783
It's clever.

296
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,211
Yeah.

297
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:37,860
Well he grew up with the rich dad and
he is an interesting way to live your

298
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:38,240
life.

299
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,380
But he came up to me and he said,

300
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,420
you've got to go to the hospital.

301
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:42,901
You've got to do it.

302
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:43,081
Well,

303
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:44,010
it's the hospital now.

304
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,630
I know you've got to go to the hospital.

305
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,530
Yeah,

306
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,070
I'm okay.

307
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,150
I turned to him and I said,

308
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:48,984
yeah.

309
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,170
I said,

310
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,003
yeah,

311
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,800
but he turned away or,

312
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:53,290
you know,

313
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,360
cause there's a lot going on.

314
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,700
I may turn back and when you have to go
to the hospital now I'm taking you now

315
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:00,534
and I,

316
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,390
you really want me to go to the hospital,

317
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,433
right?

318
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,813
Too much.

319
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,790
So then I went to the
Pratt conference instead,

320
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,710
and as I walked into the past conference,

321
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,910
go show was going,

322
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,450
we've just had to take James
Thompson to the hospital

323
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,153
grieving.

324
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,080
And I'm the,

325
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm someone caught into it
and I was drinking a drink.

326
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,013
And I think

327
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,950
that sums it all up there.

328
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,300
Corella on words.

329
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,271
Yeah.

330
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:29,740
That's a corrupt organization.

331
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,790
That's horse shit.

332
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,030
They're pretending you were hurt
more than you were to pump Kimbo up.

333
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,540
Yeah.

334
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,500
Wow.

335
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,710
That's interesting.

336
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,933
Yeah.

337
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,060
[inaudible].
