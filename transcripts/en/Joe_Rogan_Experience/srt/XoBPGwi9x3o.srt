1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,450
Fairly Lockhart,

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:03,991
by the way.

4
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:05,970
A used to be on the Frank
Kelly endo shown is,

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,111
in my opinion,

6
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:08,820
one of the best impression is out there.

7
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:09,350
You,

8
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,400
you do impressions that
are very weird man.

9
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:14,280
You do some impressions
that no one else does.

10
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:14,700
That's the,

11
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,650
I figured that that's what you should do.

12
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:17,490
I always figured it's like,

13
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:19,680
why get in and do something?

14
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,461
The Nicholson,

15
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:21,091
the ones like that,

16
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:24,810
it's like I try to find a strange
one and I do it like [inaudible] man,

17
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:26,400
don't nobody do it.

18
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,570
Bunch of bitches.

19
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,630
I do it better than I to t man,

20
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,930
not to his voiceover work and whatnot.

21
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,780
I love to say what not do you
know at the Lisbon everything?

22
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,570
I tried to make a little list
there and he fights a little lift,

23
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:41,430
but it's kind of gangster
and it works for him.

24
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,091
You know what I'm saying?

25
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:42,460
Pitch us,

26
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,293
dig it.

27
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,550
I used to do that at the comedy store.

28
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:50,100
I used to call the comedy store
is ice tea in this poor guy,

29
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:50,791
Kenny Tenney.

30
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,260
This guy used to work the phones there.

31
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,130
Do you remember this guy?

32
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,360
He was Mitsis Pool Guy
and there was something,

33
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,420
something was off with him.

34
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:58,141
Definitely say,

35
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:58,411
I mean,

36
00:00:58,411 --> 00:00:59,520
I don't want to say what he had,

37
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:01,070
but he definitely wasn't one of us.

38
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,680
You know,

39
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,880
he wasn't thinking right,

40
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:03,480
but he was,

41
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:03,991
he was like,

42
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:04,660
he got,

43
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,461
he made money.

44
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:05,850
He,

45
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,960
he had a pool company,

46
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,400
he cleaned pulls and he did it well,

47
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,560
but he'd function like
an eight year old and a,

48
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:13,410
I would call him every time
he would pick up the phone,

49
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,080
I would call them and I would be ice
tea and he would fall for it every time.

50
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:16,291
But like,

51
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:16,621
Yo man,

52
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,390
I'm bringing 30 people in tonight,

53
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:18,960
man.

54
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,690
What you got on my booth that you would

55
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,790
like?

56
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,490
I Miss Jay,

57
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,860
we don't have a booth at six 30 I'm like,

58
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:27,150
you better build one for me.

59
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:28,260
Well I'll see if we can,

60
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:28,740
I'm just like,

61
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,573
ah.

62
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,360
That's how I would brush
up on the impression as if
I could pull Kenny Turney.

63
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,730
I felt like it was golden.

64
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:36,931
Yeah.

65
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:37,410
How do you,

66
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,260
do you work impressions of you practice
them at home and then eventually bring

67
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:43,110
them this stage or do you know when you
hear somebody whether or not you can do

68
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:43,590
it?

69
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,921
You know,

70
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,310
I,

71
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,410
there's a lot of people,

72
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,740
if you hear them right away,

73
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:47,271
I know I can do it.

74
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:49,380
If somebody that tends to have a deeper
voice or something like that or if

75
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:50,820
there's a weird thing about them,

76
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,050
I know I can do it,

77
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:54,690
but I always more so
than the way it sounds,

78
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:57,840
it's the way somebody looks when they
talk because people move their mouth a

79
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:59,880
certain way that will
reveal half the impression.

80
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,450
You know,

81
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,370
I just realized talking
to you about impressions,

82
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,271
you know,

83
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:03,900
I don't,

84
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,150
I've never practiced any of
the impressions that I've done.

85
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,340
I just do them like with Joey
Diaz or something like that.

86
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:10,050
I just know I can do it and I just do it.

87
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:10,590
Do you,

88
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,281
are you that way too?

89
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,390
Like you hear someone talk?

90
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:12,811
Yeah.

91
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:15,210
I think it's like you got
to get out of your own way.

92
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,340
You've just let it filter in and come out.

93
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:18,010
Come out of here,

94
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,440
you know,

95
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,260
cause it's like,

96
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,810
like you'll hear it if you
should try to scrutinize it,

97
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,070
you'll really start to fuck it up.

98
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,913
But

99
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,510
you know,

100
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,691
I'll,

101
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:28,770
I'll listen to them on headphones and if
I don't hear my voice anymore and that

102
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:29,604
means I've matched it,

103
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,630
wo it means I've matched it.

104
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:35,480
It looks like the Morgan Freeman when
I started working on an eighth grade,

105
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:36,560
I'm here that way.

106
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,040
I now hold on Joe Rogan.

107
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,113
Let me get to that.

108
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,643
Let's see here.

109
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,250
There's a fella named Morgan Freeman
and I started working on the impression

110
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,270
when I was in the eighth grade.

111
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,283
Yes sir.

112
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,850
I was about 14 years old,

113
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,410
jerked off seven times a day.

114
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,161
She's had,

115
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:52,590
it's creepy and it took me forever.

116
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,371
What happens,

117
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:53,731
creep.

118
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:55,380
And the way I finally perfected it,

119
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:57,990
when I was like 22 I saw Ben Affleck on,

120
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:58,201
on,

121
00:02:58,201 --> 00:02:58,531
on,

122
00:02:58,531 --> 00:02:59,020
um,

123
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,681
Dave Letterman.

124
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:01,540
And he was doing it a
Morgan Freeman impression,

125
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,291
but it was horrible.

126
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,280
But he was doing one thing.

127
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,210
I wasn't doing it right.

128
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,260
It's that thing.

129
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:06,094
It's all in here.

130
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,380
He was adding that
everything else was wrong.

131
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,200
And I married the two and I was
talking like Morgan Freeman all day.

132
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,160
I was calling restaurants,

133
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:16,000
but like I'd like to get a table
for two planes and was like,

134
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:16,301
okay,

135
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:16,841
Mr. Freeman.

136
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:17,950
I was testing it out and I was like,

137
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:18,784
oh my God,

138
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,480
amazing.

139
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,261
So when I nail one,

140
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:23,410
I've been working on a Tom Hanks
for years and I still can't get it.

141
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,280
There's something,

142
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,750
but he's one of those like ice tea,

143
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:26,800
like Morgan Freeman.

144
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:27,820
Everybody knows who he is,

145
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:29,290
but nobody does.

146
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,300
And you know it's somewhere in here.

147
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:32,134
I found that I can,

148
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,090
I can go back and forth with it,

149
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:34,561
but it's,

150
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:35,050
it's,

151
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,920
you miss it a little.

152
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,754
Yeah.

153
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,380
I'm game show hosts d with it right now,

154
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:39,990
but it's like there's,

155
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,530
there's World War II,

156
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,590
Tom Hanks who's very solemn
and talks about World War II,

157
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,150
but then there's,

158
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,401
you know,

159
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,300
I'm on Conan O'brien.

160
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,980
The shape of your head is wrong,

161
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,570
but I can't make that noise.

162
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,160
I think that is,

163
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,650
I think that has lots to
do with impressions because
there's certain impressions

164
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,060
that I can do that other people can't do.

165
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,340
Right.

166
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,590
I think it's the shape of my face.

167
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:57,070
There's money,

168
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,460
there's ways to manipulate your throat.

169
00:03:59,610 --> 00:03:59,860
I mean,

170
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,770
luck until he was told to book the Slo.

171
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,780
Definitely.

172
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,011
You know,

173
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,160
you can move contort your
mouth like biggie smalls.

174
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:08,140
That's totally working on
little personal one time too.

175
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,800
And I found out how to
sound like a fuck La.

176
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,050
It's like you can contort your mouth.

177
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:14,884
You Ralphie May.

178
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,473
He's

179
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,940
much love Ralphie.

180
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:25,774
If you listening,

181
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,650
you know we love you.

182
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,090
He said Cartman on those.

183
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,070
I don't know what happens
when you get an office,

184
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:34,150
but clearly someone sits you down and
just your agenda talking about before he

185
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:34,984
was in office,

186
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,330
you know,

187
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:35,960
you're sorry.

188
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,793
Inhaled well you could say,

189
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,540
cause it was the point you
doing a Bama well it's a,

190
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,800
it's time for weed.

191
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,870
I uh,

192
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,630
it's like pauses the twin,

193
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:44,470
every word I say.

194
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,470
So the stupid people can understand me.

195
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,320
Uh,

196
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,640
no.

197
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,021
Did you?

198
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:50,854
Oh,

199
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,863
in college sir,

200
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:52,691
uh,

201
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:53,710
I did you inhale?

202
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,760
I took bong rips out of a
homemade bomb and I blew them.

203
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,590
And to everybody on the floors,

204
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,453
mouth,

205
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,333
we got a high,

206
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,930
that's the place that the
site is still bill still bill.

207
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:08,830
One of the best documentaries I've
seen in pro Bobby Lee's recommendation.

208
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:09,460
Funny enough.

209
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:09,970
Wow.

210
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,280
And not funny enough because sometimes
he recommends really good stuff,

211
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:13,810
but other times he recommends horrible.

212
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,250
It's the worst thing
he's ever recommended.

213
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,203
Uh,

214
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,740
the,

215
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,140
um,

216
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,200
the whatcha call it movie
with a river Phoenix,

217
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:20,720
his brother.

218
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,390
Uh Oh yeah,

219
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:23,171
I heard there was terrible.

220
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:23,771
It was awful.

221
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:24,760
He thought it was brilliant.

222
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,500
Really.

223
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,530
And it's fucking brilliant.

224
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,520
Fucking brilliant book.

225
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,061
Lovey leave.

226
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:31,894
It's brilliant.

227
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,733
It wasn't brilliant.

228
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,770
A lot of his stuff.

229
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,290
He bought impressions.

230
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,240
Bobby's into good,

231
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,200
pretty good movies.

232
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:39,010
And you do Bobby Lee.

233
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:39,760
Can you do,

234
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,960
I can do fucking Bobby Lee.

235
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,800
I've been a fucking bomb.

236
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:45,281
Joe Rogan.

237
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,240
I'm gonna fucking bomb.

238
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,650
And they walked in pretty close.

239
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,010
Yeah.

240
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,680
Close as much as he knew Jesse Ventura.

241
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,970
Jesse the body.

242
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:52,804
Ventura.

243
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,361
That's vow.

244
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,250
It's Jesse Ventura.

245
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:55,970
That's for,

246
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,681
come on Joe.

247
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:58,910
Rogan's to talk the truth.

248
00:05:59,530 --> 00:05:59,671
Yeah,

249
00:05:59,671 --> 00:06:00,340
that's good.

250
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:00,921
I think I got pretty,

251
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:01,754
God damn good.

252
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,720
I've never done that before.

253
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,680
Nine one one was an inside job.

254
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,720
If you think the ladder,

255
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,030
you're the one who's missing four brother,

256
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,100
you don't think that Rumsfeld knew what
we was doing when he told those troops

257
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:17,510
to stand down.

258
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,280
Niche almost sounds a little
Sam Elliott in there too,

259
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:22,990
a little bit.

260
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,260
Raj Realm.

261
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,510
If you don't get any roadhouse quotes in,

262
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:32,510
you show that man to the door
and if he doesn't go quietly,

263
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,720
what does it use this truck and head
and by yourself at dodge ram pickup with

264
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:41,720
all the torque and you definitely
know how to stretch his words out.

265
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,120
The waist turns his words
and rocky get on the bike.

266
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,983
Rocky.

267
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,711
Rocky.

268
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:46,101
Dennis,

269
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,440
what was that thing you did about ice,

270
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,380
tea and cocoa?

271
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,490
What did you do recently?

272
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,163
Ah,

273
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,090
triply show.

274
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,340
Uh,

275
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,970
maybe ball baby pool.

276
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,211
Yeah,

277
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:58,550
we did an ice tea commercial with,

278
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,493
with a coco.

279
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,430
Great Cocoa Look alike my way.

280
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,281
Did she look just like,

281
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:03,411
oh,

282
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:03,741
go for it.

283
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:04,670
She was built like her.

284
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:06,530
She was an anomaly like this huge ass.

285
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:07,970
Huge boobs and this tiny waist.

286
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,440
Now granted it was all sculpted that way,

287
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:10,700
but it was still this anomaly.

288
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:11,210
It was like,

289
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,043
whoa.

290
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,050
It was ridiculous.

291
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,380
Sculptors meaning like operations,

292
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,550
operations at top.

293
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:19,370
I've heard people saying that Coco and
my wife said she's absolutely beautiful.

294
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,930
I I um,

295
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,741
but uh,

296
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:21,891
yeah,

297
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:22,820
we did the ice tea thing.

298
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:24,320
We did the baby bull man.

299
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:26,040
That went over pretty well and he saw it.

300
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,170
Red Band tweeted it.

301
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,500
Yeah.

302
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,700
An ice tea tweeted back.

303
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,683
What did it say?

304
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,231
What did he say?

305
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:31,410
I said a,

306
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,820
uh,

307
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,690
I made a video.

308
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:33,830
What do you think about this?

309
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:35,900
And he might say it's interesting.

310
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,150
I'd say that's pretty
God damn good iced tea.

311
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,020
That's that I,

312
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,870
that's man,

313
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,830
that's dead.

314
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,910
That's 100%.

315
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,910
And I'm fighting off a cold
from the past three days.

316
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:47,930
Sometimes I want to have a cold.

317
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:49,070
My impressions to get a little better.

318
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:50,810
Like I've never done
that Ventura one before.

319
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:51,270
I didn't know that.

320
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,510
Really do a good bro call.

321
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,583
I left on good bro.

322
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,770
Jamie off [inaudible]

323
00:07:59,480 --> 00:07:59,820
shooters,

324
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,770
bombs are falling and draw all of iron.

325
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,040
Did you know Tom Brokaw was
a pothead 24 hour day plan?

326
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,560
Is He really prideful pot?

327
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,190
I take wrong reps on a daily.

328
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,210
I only smoking indycar.

329
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,210
I the shit hero makes me
not want to do my job.

330
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,290
That's hilarious.

331
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,580
That's so good guy nuts.

332
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,810
He really does smoke.

333
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,893
Where'd you hear this?

334
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,521
You know,

335
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:27,960
I read it somewhere
and I just ran with it.

336
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,310
I didn't research that
I was looking at school.

337
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:30,750
Go Do.

338
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:30,910
