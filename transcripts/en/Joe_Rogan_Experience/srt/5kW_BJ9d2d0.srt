1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:03,621
Oh,

2
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:04,820
sweet bitches.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,080
Here we go again.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,250
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience podcast is brought to you by

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,750
audible.com.

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,050
If you go to audible.com
forward slash Joe,

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,260
you will get one free audio book and
you can try audible free for 30 days.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,970
It's a bad ass service.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,390
It's one of the coolest
ways to spend time,

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,750
whether it's in traffic or stuck on a
train somewhere in a plane or whenever

11
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:35,210
you're just forced to just sit there.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,920
It makes that time so much
better to have a good audio book.

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,700
Um,

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,271
it just,

15
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:41,630
uh,

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,430
I've been a fan of audio books forever
and audible is taken to the next level

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,540
with this thing they have called whisper
sync and this is in an application they

18
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,820
developed for the kindle fire Hd.

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,080
And what it is,

20
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:55,340
is when you're reading a book,

21
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:57,140
you read a book on the
kindle and say like,

22
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:01,430
you get to page 10 and you fall asleep
when you get up in the morning and get in

23
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:02,264
your car,

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,670
your car will start playing an audio
version of the book right where you left

25
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:08,390
off.

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,950
It's such a cool move.

27
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:10,911
I'm a huge,

28
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:14,120
huge fan of that and Brian
is pulling up hooker books,

29
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,640
which I don't think you should be
reading because those books are boring.

30
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,760
Hooker book read to you.

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,713
Are you kidding me?

32
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,730
You buy some old bitch whose mouth is
all like sandpaper from a million Dick's

33
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:27,000
been in there.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,020
Does every year and under homeland ander

35
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,531
Oh,

36
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:31,420
I think she's psychic Xavier Hollander.

37
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,410
She was like,

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,290
when I was in like high school,

39
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:40,470
she was like one of those first like b
movie freaks that would like do like show

40
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:41,051
time,

41
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:42,670
2:00 in the morning movies.

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,240
Oh really?

43
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,451
Yeah.

44
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:45,970
They have these terrible
like cinemax movies.

45
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,423
Yeah.

46
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,291
Bunch of those.

47
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,330
Like she would always like,

48
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:50,751
oh my God,

49
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:51,620
I can't believe this happening.

50
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:54,470
Like find yourself in a fucking
closet with some dude fingering her.

51
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:54,860
Well,

52
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,490
what's cool is that you can play samples
on audible so you can get a sample of

53
00:01:58,491 --> 00:01:59,600
the narration to.

54
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,780
So we can listen to a little bit
of this happy guide to hookers.

55
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:03,300
Sex.

56
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,300
I would say we got have mind blowing
sex and if you follow the advice here in

57
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,010
that's not a hooker operator is terrible.

58
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,363
Please,

59
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,090
please stick my mouth on your penis.

60
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,600
You will not find advice in here
about how to attract and seduce it.

61
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,240
Mate.

62
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,073
Oh,

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,100
that is a woman who's made
entirely out of mayonnaise.

64
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,460
That was so you could get
any audible audio book.

65
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:33,330
Do you have already a book?

66
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:33,781
No,

67
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:34,614
I don't have it on me.

68
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,000
I got my audio book.

69
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,863
I don't know

70
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,820
my own audio book.

71
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,320
What is it?

72
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,621
The,

73
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:39,741
uh,

74
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:40,431
the name of the book?

75
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:42,020
Fresh off the bush off the boat.

76
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,650
Let's see.

77
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,041
Pull it up,

78
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:43,874
Brian,

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,870
to see if they have like
some hooker reading it.

80
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,550
Oh Shit.

81
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,503
That's me.

82
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,433
But you didn't read.

83
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,333
Did you read it?

84
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,853
Read it.

85
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,480
They wouldn't have it with somebody else.

86
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,620
That would be insulting.

87
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,680
I mean they did for

88
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,090
the dude just sucks it.

89
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:01,930
Reading his own book.

90
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,310
I asked for William Hung.

91
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,683
I was like,

92
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,760
I don't read the book.

93
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,580
Be what happened to that dude.

94
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,220
Should we tell the waiter
we should send these back?

95
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,820
Oh Dude,

96
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:14,680
you're,

97
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,010
you're,

98
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,660
you're better at talking sexton.

99
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,210
That check.

100
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,070
Was that reading your own book?

101
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,770
Like was that like a long
process or was it kind of like,

102
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,110
oh it's Kinda cool I get to
read this whole book through?

103
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:24,700
No,

104
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,070
it was,

105
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:25,940
it was weird,

106
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:29,960
but I'm reading it was cool because I
had only read my book twice when I edited

107
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:30,051
it.

108
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:32,630
So for reading the audio was the
third time I read the book it's like,

109
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:32,910
Oh,

110
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,743
this is dope book.

111
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:35,971
It was funny,

112
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:37,500
but it is weird to hear your own voice.

113
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:38,990
It takes like a half day to be like,

114
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,110
that's my fucking voice.

115
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
You get used to that shit.

116
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,240

The Way Chinese to spelling?

148
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:37,620
Like the way you say your name long,

Yeah.

164
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,870
It's tricky though.

165
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:56,890
And you're going from characters.

166
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:57,161
Hit it.

167
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:57,760

Joe Rogan podcast.

171
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,873
Powerful.

172
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,190
Eddie Wong is in the building.

173
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,830
That's h u a n g people,

174
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,113
people searching,

175
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,781
W O,

176
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:17,901
n,

177
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,220
g like us,

178
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,323
silly,

179
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:20,901
silly,

180
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,130
uninformed Americans.

181
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,870
It is funny that I'm like,

182
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,460
they have to change those,

183
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,490
those characters and to translate your
name into English and put it into a sound

184
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,190
and for different people at
disputes on how you should do that.

185
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,200
It's fucking crazy because it's
like taking a photo and being like,

186
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,930
how's that photo sound home?

187
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:39,901
You know,

188
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:41,310
like it's pretty impossible

189
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:41,620
that.

190
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:41,831
Yeah.

191
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:42,080
Well,

192
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,970
with the way you said that,

193
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:47,150
it's like taking a photo because the
way you guys look at like language,

194
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,050
the Chinese competitors totally different.

195
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,910
It's a different way of
looking at the whole world.

196
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,540
Yeah,

197
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,010
that's a mind fuck and a half right?

198
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,370
It's kind of caveman
steve because it's like,

199
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:56,671
all right,

200
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:57,431
I want to say this,

201
00:05:57,431 --> 00:05:58,390
I'm going to draw it out,

202
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,180
you know,

203
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,520
kind of.

204
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,071
It's cool.

205
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:00,940
It's very like,

206
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,980
it's an artistic fucking language.

207
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,390
Definitely like it a lot.

208
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,691
Well,

209
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:05,170
it's good.

210
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,130
It looks good on people
when you talk to it too.

211
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,870
But the funniest shit is
like white boy Asian tattoos.

212
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,430
Like see what duties,

213
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:12,730
like,

214
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,020
Hey,

215
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,940
what's the same motherfucker
that says energy on your arm?

216
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,850
Like you're like a red bull ahead.

217
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,340
You wrote energy on your arm.

218
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,700
The digital and mobile energy positivity.

219
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,890
I'm all about putting on my
consciousness to the universe.

220
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,490
The Chinese tattoos.

221
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,610
They say that the Gypson language of
hieroglyphs is an even bigger mind fuck.

222
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,880
Because they,

223
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,280
they see everything in these,

224
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,600
like these symbols,

225
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,351
you know,

226
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:47,240
and that we are the way Americans and
people read English language the way we

227
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,080
look at.

228
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,520
Just even like the way you'll,

229
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,070
you'll look at sentences.

230
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:55,850
It's completely different than if
you tried to read like hieroglyphics.

231
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:56,401
Yeah.

232
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,260
I mean I don't read hieroglyphics,

233
00:06:58,261 --> 00:06:59,880
but I heard that shit is mad hard.

234
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:01,200
They needed this stone for it.

235
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:02,190
The Rosetta stone.

236
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:02,521
Yeah,

237
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:03,354
they did.

238
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,111
Yeah.

239
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:05,490
Hieroglyphics or some shit,

240
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,460
if that's even more caveman than,

241
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,191
than Mandarin.

242
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:12,060
Chinese like Chinese is almost
like refined hieroglyphics,

243
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,740
but it still makes no sense.

244
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,041
Well,

245
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:14,750
the fascinating

246
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,610
thing about the,

247
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:15,731
uh,

248
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:20,731
the hieroglyphics is that they depict
all of the Pharaohs and they depict them

249
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:24,020
from this whatever dynasty.

250
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:24,351
The,

251
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:25,184
um,

252
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:25,600
you know,

253
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,900
the last pharaohs existed in
to what gets into like fiction,

254
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,090
they think like 30,000 years.

255
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:35,570
Like then they live in like hundreds
years long and they're fucking 10 feet

256
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:35,970
tall.

257
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,400
It gets like real wacky,

258
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:38,840
like as shit gets like super,

259
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:43,550
super old know the stories got more and
more screwy before anybody bothered to

260
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:44,384
write them down.

261
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,130
So it makes you wonder like,

262
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,371
man,

263
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:48,980
how long has that hieroglyphs
writing actually been around?

264
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:49,550
You know,

265
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,120
Yo man,

266
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,080
salad tossing,

267
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:54,260
Yoshi did give me the heads up bogus.

268
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,690
Yo.

269
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,180
She reads a lot of books.

270
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:56,910
Motherfucker.

271
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,760
Joe Rogan is a smart motherfucker.

272
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,110
Well I'm just fascinated by weird shit
like the Egyptian culture Egypt in

273
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,520
culture.

274
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,353
That's the cradle,

275
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,841
you know what I mean?

276
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:07,010
That's where everybody came from.

277
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,120
Supposedly.

278
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:08,963
Yeah.

279
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,580
Um,

280
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,413
the,

281
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,100
the only issue is that there's some new
shit they've been finding that's even

282
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:14,934
older than that.

283
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,640
The real question when it gets to like
something like Egypt or anywhere we've

284
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,841
had some really,

285
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:23,730
really old shit is like,

286
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:27,210
what happens if you find shit that's
way older and what do you do then?

287
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:29,910
Like you can't say the
Egypt was like the oldest,

288
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:34,320
like really advanced culture when you
find like go back lay tappy which is in

289
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:35,154
Turkey,

290
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,320
which is 14,000 years old.

291
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,240
It's so much earlier than Egypt

292
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,560
but not earlier than Africa in general.

293
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:42,940
Like the out of Africa theory,

294
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:45,040
right or happy

295
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,050
is right now the oldest known complex
structure that a human has ever pilled and

296
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,500
they know that it's at
least 14,000 years old.

297
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,510
That's fucking crazy.

298
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:56,311
And not only that,

299
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:59,970
they know that it existed for thousands
of years before it was intentionally

300
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,530
covered and they've only.

301
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,940
I think as of right now,

302
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:07,941
they've only uncovered like five
percent of the entire structure and it's

303
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:11,490
enormous and there's a
series of circles and stones,

304
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,560
but they've done whatever they do with
radio waves or whatever they do to to map

305
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:19,500
out what's going on under the surface
and they've determined that it's massive.

306
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,693
That's awesome.

307
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,870
Fourteen thousand years ago,

308
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:24,390
so that's even older than than Egypt,

309
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,373
you know?

310
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,310
That's insane.

311
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,340
You know that something was
happening in Turkey before.

312
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,300
It's something huge,

313
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,000
not just something he doesn't like.

314
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:36,330
A 14 foot stone columns that had been
caught and moved hundreds of tons of

315
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:37,140
stone.

316
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,321
I mean,

317
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:38,154
these are like,

318
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,630
this is advanced construction.

319
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,460
It doesn't dispel out of Africa though,

320
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:41,960
right?

321
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,900
It doesn't necessarily.

322
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,290
No,

323
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:43,500
no,

324
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,930
because 14,000 years ago
it's still ain't shit.

325
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,330
We're talking about human beings
coming out of Africa and migraines.

326
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,640
It's like millions.

327
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,240
Yeah.

328
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,590
It's like,

329
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,710
what is a human,

330
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,040
you know,

331
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,990
it gets too low.

332
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,830
Is it Jack Enemy?

333
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:56,131
Which,

334
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:56,280
uh,

335
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,980
which different Australia pythagoreous
like at what point in time do you decided

336
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,770
to early human because at one point in
time it's like fucking the media and it

337
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:09,030
goes from Amoeba to being a lower
primate and to being a higher primate.

338
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,953
When is that?

339
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,063
That's true.

340
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,670
It's all how you frame
it because the people,

341
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:13,920
you know,

342
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,520
you wouldn't want to
hang out with Australia,

343
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:17,490
Perth against the guy
that's fucking idiots.

344
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,600
They're going to be a monkey man eating
his own shit and fucking try to kill

345
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:22,201
your cat.

346
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:23,970
And that's not a human.

347
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,271
You know,

348
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:25,860
it'd be like almost a human,

349
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:26,880
you know.

350
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,880
But I think I'm civilization in
Mesopotamia was a looks super advanced.

351
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:38,931
They know like 6,000 years ago in
Turkey now being 14,000 years still,

352
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:43,320
I could go back to like 30,000 years and
that ain't shit in terms of the history

353
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:47,730
of the earth and that would be insane for
us to think that 30,000 years ago they

354
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,260
had like complex cities,

355
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,620
but it's super positive.

356
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:50,850
Yo,

357
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,300
I was talking to someone
this week at Ted two.

358
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,990
She was a cosmologist and she was telling
me that life can survive on Mars and

359
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,490
then people you can actually,

360
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,290
if you're willing to commit,

361
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,020
they will take you to Mars
and you can be part of the.

362
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,670
If someone was saying,

363
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:06,390
Joe,

364
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,860
I could put you on a space shuttle.

365
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:10,920
You could go to Mars and you can be
part of the first colony and you could

366
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,290
basically be the fucking
gang gets kind of Mars.

367
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,123
Would you do it?

368
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,580
No,

369
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,580
it's stupid because Mars is just
like a shitty apartment on earth.

370
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,700
That's what it's like.

371
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,040
It's like a shitty apartment
that you can't get out of.

372
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,270
Once you get there,

373
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,170
that's where you're stuck.

374
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:26,740
You can't go outside
and there's no oxygen.

375
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:28,690
You've got to terraform
and put a dome over it.

376
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,010
Life can survive out there
at night without that shit.

377
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,510
She's march of Mars.

378
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:36,780
Know that she believes can sustain life.

379
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,200
No,

380
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,033
she's silly.

381
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,970
That's not correct.

382
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,140
But hypothetic mean.

383
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,490
I don't say it's correct.

384
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:41,640
Like,

385
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:41,881
okay.

386
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:42,790
Hypothetically you,

387
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,890
let's say it was correct,

388
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,450
let's say who it was,

389
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,440
but it would have to be a very small
area because most of Mars doesn't have.

390
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,090
Is it possible that the,

391
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,250
uh,

392
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,460
the atmosphere would vary that much
with one part would be sustainable,

393
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,780
so alien to me?

394
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,050
Sure.

395
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,680
She wasn't talking about terraforming.

396
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,090
No,

397
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,923
she was talking about,

398
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,200
she said life can sustain on Morris.

399
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,800
She was telling me but as it is.

400
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,030
And then she showed me a media.

401
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:04,480
Right?

402
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:04,961
I was like,

403
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:05,730
okay.

404
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,230
I kind of got fucked up by the show
and tell because they're short sell,

405
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,820
kind of fucking threw me off.

406
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,181
I was like,

407
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:10,391
Damn,

408
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:11,410
you got a rock from there.

409
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,170
Terraforming means when you go to,

410
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:14,480
um,

411
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,760
a inhospitable climate and set up
machines to click in the movie alien,

412
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:19,110
right?

413
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,600
Yeah.

414
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,390
I don't see how there's any
other way to live on Mars.

415
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:22,841
Other than that,

416
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:24,540
I don't think that
atmosphere is thick enough.

417
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,770
That would be scary if those
machines broke one day or something.

418
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,700
Everyone died at once and died.

419
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,290
Slovis fixation.

420
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,630
When this air slowly gets eaten up by,

421
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:35,010
you know,

422
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,050
if someone told me you could go to Mars
and there's everything you need and it's

423
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:40,510
terraforming and con Ed was in charge,

424
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,590
I would never fucking go.

425
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,341
Listen man.

426
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:44,350
Even if he will have
con ed in La Obviously,

427
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:46,330
but in New York kind
of fucks everything up.

428
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,980
We have the same thing.

429
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:49,814
It's like,

430
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,510
I don't even fuck shit up.

431
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,600
Fucking who fucks it up,

432
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,380
your electricity.

433
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,910
The other function of Edison,

434
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,823
the

435
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,180
La was famous for the brownouts back in
the day where they just started shutting

436
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,980
power up and basically
they didn't have to do it.

437
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:03,540
They were doing.

438
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,371
It was.

439
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:05,620
It was all agreed thing.

440
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,491
Somehow or another,

441
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:06,941
it was a.

442
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:08,590
They were making a fuck
load of money doing that.

443
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:09,880
I don't remember what the scam was,

444
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,780
but people I believe lost their job
and even went to jail for that shit.

445
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,150
Those brownouts yeah,

446
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:16,360
no,

447
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,961
but Mars.

448
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:18,150
I was thinking that,

449
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:18,581
man,

450
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:19,640
I don't want to go to my.

451
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:20,920
She said you can go,

452
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,090
but you can never come back.

453
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:22,660
I was like,

454
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:22,901
okay,

455
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:23,734
let me ask you this.

456
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,360
Would you go to the desert?

457
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,910
Would you go to the middle of the
Sahara where there ain't shit.

458
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,010
It's dangerous and you could die out
there for no reason but never to stay

459
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:33,844
forever,

460
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,853
but that's Mars.

461
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,480
Mars is just like going
out into the mojave.

462
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,100
Ain't shit out there.

463
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,181
What she said though,

464
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:45,181
she said mad people from her classes and
the other professor she knows wanted to

465
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:45,881
go.

466
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:49,030
They were all wanting to sign up to go
to Mars and you got to be egotistical

467
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:50,560
motherfucker to be like,

468
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,960
I want it to be the first
one on this bullshit planet.

469
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,261
Well,

470
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:54,220
some people are silly.

471
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,670
That's a silly thing to do to go to
another planet where you can't get back.

472
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,010
Fuck that.

473
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,600
Especially if like lance bass is going,

474
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,500
isn't he the one that's
out in space and shit,

475
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:04,890
the backstreet boys or
instinct dude in space is,

476
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:05,240
uh,

477
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,190
is he out in space?

478
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,023
He's trying.

479
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,100
One of the first ones he was.

480
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,341
Oh,

481
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:10,174
he has got right.

482
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,770
And did it with like
the Russian cosmonauts,

483
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:12,041
right?

484
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:12,600
I think so.

485
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,300
Yeah.

486
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,050
No,

487
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,801
if they were like,

488
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:19,280
you got to go to Mars and Lance Bass is
that I will not fucking horrible lance

489
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:19,720
baskets,

490
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,650
good foot massages.

491
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,240
Oh really cool to hang out with.

492
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:22,661
Oh,

493
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,280
you got a foot massage from lance bass.

494
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,160
I said,

495
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,160
maybe I'm just saying I think you're
onto something better than you know,

496
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,360
going by yourself.

497
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:31,900
Tomorrow's,

498
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,081
you know,

499
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:36,040
maybe lance passes a hell
of a conversationalist and
halfway through the six

500
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:36,910
month trip you're like,

501
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:37,121
you know,

502
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:38,590
this guy's starting to fucking grow on me.

503
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,630
He's like the White Lloyd from entourage.

504
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,750
I ever watched the same here.

505
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,160
It was a horrible show.

506
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,790
I only watched it.

507
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:47,880
What happened to the Asian?

508
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,710
And I don't know if it was a
fair representative of the show.

509
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,050
I only it once and I was like,

510
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,270
what the fuck's going on here?

511
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,541
Well,

512
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:54,770
who?

513
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,603
What are they watching?

514
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:55,800
Well,

515
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,890
isn't the Asian gay?

516
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,030
He was mad gay.

517
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,353
A lot of.

518
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,210
Yeah.

519
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,043
Yeah.

520
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,410
Would you go to Mars?

521
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:06,951
Would you?

522
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:07,460
If you could,

523
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,840
if you knew it was dope.

524
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,000
If you knew it was like
Alaska in the summer,

525
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,530
just beautiful green

526
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,890
like they have the Bush company.

527
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:14,724
I would go,

528
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,430
you know?

529
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,710
No.

530
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,370
If I could go to Mars and come back.

531
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,150
If you could go and come back,

532
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,411
go and come back.

533
00:15:20,411 --> 00:15:22,510
But it was only a 90
percent chance of success.

534
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,000
Success meaning like life life coming
back like 10 percent possibility that

535
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,140
there might be a fucking solar flare
while you're in the middle of the flight

536
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:33,130
back and everybody in the

537
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,203
playing guitar.

538
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,120
I wouldn't need a 100
percent like I'm not.

539
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,650
I'm not dude that I won't
even get laser eye surgery.

540
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,780
One hundred percent.

541
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:42,760
Like my brothers all
got laser eye surgery.

542
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,450
I was like,

543
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,141
you Chinese,

544
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:45,590
you should not be fucking with your eyes.

545
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,110
You already fucked up and now you're
going to introduce this new element of

546
00:15:50,111 --> 00:15:50,650
surgery.

547
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,483
Hell No.

548
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,020
Well they're supposedly
had it down pretty good.

549
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,360
At what level will you
be willing to do it?

550
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,070
Like 200 percent.

551
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,791
Two hundred percent.

552
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,120
Yeah.

553
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,470
I don't think that's how could they do?

554
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,650
No,

555
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,810
it wouldn't need to be 100
percent that 100 percent back

556
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,080
a hundred percent.

557
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,720
You know,

558
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,130
come from New York to La.

559
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,061
You might as well.

560
00:16:12,061 --> 00:16:12,800
Look,

561
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,180
if it was at 97 percent,

562
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:15,810
I will go.

563
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,330
I'll deal with a three percent plus minus.

564
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:21,810
I would imagine that if people keep going
the way we're going now and a thousand

565
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:24,660
years from now getting to Mars will
be just like going to New York.

566
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,471
Oh,

567
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:26,131
that would be awesome.

568
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:28,470
If we don't blow each other
up in a thousand years,

569
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,320
just imagine what we've done in
200 years and a thousand years.

570
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,820
There'll be plane flights tomorrow.

571
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,580
It'll be so fast.

572
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,800
Like five hours later you're on Mars.

573
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,960
Did you say your present
was seven percent?

574
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,770
90 seven.

575
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:40,951
Oh,

576
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:41,400
nice.

577
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,233
Yeah,

578
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,350
I would love to go.

579
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,453
I would love to go.

580
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,530
I just want to see that shit.

581
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,610
Um,

582
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,060
if you had a choice between going to
another planet or going back in time,

583
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,643
oh,

584
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,180
that's a good call because going back
in time you kind of know what you could

585
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,014
see.

586
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,820
But man,

587
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:01,530
going back in time,

588
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,060
I would probably,

589
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:04,721
you know,

590
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:06,820
I would want to go to Mars
because going back in time,

591
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:07,930
the other times we've had,

592
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,760
it's like less amenable.

593
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,661
Do you know what I mean?

594
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:12,400
Like there's more diseases.

595
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,260
You don't get killed as easily.

596
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:16,900
Like you get shanked you know
when you die back in the day,

597
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:17,734
you get shanked.

598
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,810
It's not like a bullet in the head.

599
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,680
You could die easily.

600
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:25,600
Now I would rather go to the future
then go backwards for safety sake.

601
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,580
Not just safety sake,

602
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,020
but I want to see the next shit.

603
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,253
There's not really,

604
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,200
I'm not like woody Allen where there's
a period of time I would love to Tony's

605
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,123
parents,

606
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,193
you know,

607
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,120
would love to be alone to 30 to tell you,

608
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,480
you know,

609
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,900
like hell no man,

610
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:42,790
like motherfuckers didn't have ac.

611
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,160
A few.

612
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,900
I would way rather see the future,

613
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:47,040
like a peek at the future.

614
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,150
Then a peak at the past,

615
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,330
but if it had,

616
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,030
if I had to choose between going
to Mars or going to the past,

617
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:52,811
I think the past,

618
00:17:52,811 --> 00:17:53,620
without a doubt,

619
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,260
I would love to see how people
lived thousands of years ago.

620
00:17:56,261 --> 00:17:56,561
Yeah,

621
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:56,801
man.

622
00:17:56,801 --> 00:17:58,820
To just peek in on gang is con.

623
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,820
Oh hell yeah.

624
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,450
How fucked up.

625
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:02,450
So heavy going.

626
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,261
I thought about it.

627
00:18:05,261 --> 00:18:06,700
I would ride with gang gets caught.

628
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:09,330
I'd be motherfucking I arrived
for you like pull up in a tank,

629
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,170
a tank light.

630
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,420
These motherfuckers on
fire with machine guns.

631
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,760
They don't know what's going
on and you will be the king.

632
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,250
You Suck my dick in front of everybody.

633
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,510
I want to go back in time with a fucking
like ipad and be with gangs like Yo,

634
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:25,300
you're the original rough rider.

635
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:27,110
You're like dmx before 10 motherfucker.

636
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,800
You the fucking Chinky idea.

637
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:29,250
Max.

638
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,470
I want to film this shit and make a
rough riders video with the volume

639
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:36,220
Mongolians on horses and fucking crossbows
and shit would make you eat your own

640
00:18:36,221 --> 00:18:40,470
calves and calf off and
make you cook it and eat it.

641
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,090
He would rob me for my
ipad and throw me in a part

642
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,720
of a gang has come with suck dude.

643
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,280
Either fuck my mom and be like,

644
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:55,780
I want a genetically duplicate myself in
your mom or chop me up and put me in a

645
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:56,140
pie.

646
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,140
I've been listening to a Dan Carlin
Columbian barbecue by as Dan Carlin was a,

647
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,023
the um,

648
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:03,541
uh,

649
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:03,900
the,

650
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,350
our grit,

651
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,490
our guests on Monday and he has a podcast
called hardcore history and right now

652
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:10,050
it's all about the Mongols.

653
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,420
That's all he's been talking to

654
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,323
about

655
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,630
civilization ever barbecue.

656
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,010
Listen,

657
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,170
man style.

658
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,480
It's like meat over fire because that's
what you do when you're raping and

659
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:23,314
killing people.

660
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,420
That baby corn,

661
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:26,610
that Mongolians habits,

662
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:27,540
so amazing.

663
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:31,450
Peaky core and what is it about being
in court and so much more exciting than

664
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:33,430
regular that Mongolian produce,

665
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:34,610
that fucking baby corn,

666
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:35,970
the,

667
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,540
the story of the,

668
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,850
of the Mongols and how much
they accomplished and they
took over countries and

669
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:47,851
then they would force the people in that
country to go with them to war and they

670
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:52,660
would become soldiers like they would
invade Poland and steel Polish people.

671
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:55,510
They made French people fight
against other Europeans.

672
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,310
They just think,

673
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,860
oh bitch,

674
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,440
you're coming with us and
you're going to be us now.

675
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,270
What are you going to do?

676
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,120
You got to fight for us.

677
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:02,230
You're going to die right now.

678
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,820
Are going to take a fight,

679
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,650
and they just start fighting other people.

680
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:07,300
They incorporate them into their army.

681
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:09,970
Like they had crazy to join their crew.

682
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:14,440
Everyone joined the crew and it was
like he was basically Drogo from game of

683
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:15,970
thrones in real life,

684
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,740
but even more fucked up because after,

685
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,190
after you would conquer like
the people that were left,

686
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,791
they would say,

687
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:22,121
okay,

688
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:22,990
congratulations.

689
00:20:22,991 --> 00:20:23,824
We won.

690
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,760
There's no one left to kill,

691
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:25,594
so you're free to go,

692
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,140
and then the three miles later they'd
fucking run them down and hacked them to

693
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:29,850
bits.

694
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,683
Wow,

695
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,570
dude,

696
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,520
this Dan Carlin,

697
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,453
the guy is,

698
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,480
he's a trip man.

699
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,620
He's a serious historian
and especially this,

700
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,700
this whole period that
he's going over right now.

701
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,720
It's fucking great to
make the live in 1200.

702
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:44,883
You know,

703
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,420
Jesus Christ,

704
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,450
the Nutty Shit that that
guy was going through.

705
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Just they said that some insane percentage
of the population of that area has

706
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,440
his DNA.

707
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,870
He's the most duplicated man in the world.

708
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,853
Ever.

709
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,370
Ever,

710
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:00,790
ever.

711
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,160
If there's one person I love myself,

712
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,510
I'm not an egotist could do,

713
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:05,890
but I do kind of like myself.

714
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,270
If I could be any other man though,

715
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,260
it will be gang as cotton.

716
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:08,711
No doubt.

717
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:09,910
Like I wouldn't think twice.

718
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,640
Gangas con is the hardest
motherfucker ever.

719
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:13,670
He got a lot,

720
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,560
but you wouldn't want to be.

721
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,470
He was so he was like a crossbow.

722
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,900
You went back in time like that though.

723
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:24,070
You couldn't be that mean.

724
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,050
Why are we torturing everybody?

725
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,330
But that's so much pussy too.

726
00:21:27,331 --> 00:21:29,110
I mean that was tons of pussy.

727
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:29,810
Well it was,

728
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,790
it was constant.

729
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,070
It was constant pussy.

730
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,710
Yeah.

731
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,981
Yeah.

732
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:35,110
They would steal each
other's wives and shit.

733
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:35,681
Back then,

734
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:37,450
like dudes were just,

735
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,350
it was.

736
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,160
We were like,

737
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,900
chimps with swords,

738
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,351
you know,

739
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:44,410
that's what human beings for like if
you could give champs a bunch of swords,

740
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:45,970
they would do terrible,

741
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,990
horrible shit.

742
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:47,890
You know,

743
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,220
we don't think about human beings
as being capable of doing terrible,

744
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:51,801
horrible shit.

745
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:53,350
But even today,

746
00:21:53,351 --> 00:21:55,930
if you look at some of the accounts
of what's going on in North Korea,

747
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,060
those North Korea and Syria,

748
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,841
Syria,

749
00:21:58,841 --> 00:21:59,250
home,

750
00:21:59,250 --> 00:21:59,591
man,

751
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:00,250
it's bad.

752
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,680
There's parts of the world ever.

753
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,100
There's always going to be parts of the
world where it's terrible and people are

754
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:09,400
capable in those parts of the world of
doing shit that you only read about in

755
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:10,234
history books.

756
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,340
Rodman going to North Korea.

757
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,690
Insane.

758
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:13,900
Yes.

759
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,711
I tweeted that today.

760
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:17,410
Is he out of his fucking
mind out or no man,

761
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,030
they're not going to
like him in North Korea.

762
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,160
I don't think he understands
what North Korea is.

763
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,320
He's going over there to do
some sort of a Harlem Grope.

764
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:24,190
Globe trotters style.

765
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:24,611
Yeah.

766
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:25,301
I don't know,

767
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:25,720
man.

768
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,560
Americans can't really wrap
their head around how fucked up

769
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,010
it's fucked up so far.

770
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,970
It's Nazi Germany.

771
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:34,470
Yeah.

772
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,303
Just like.

773
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:39,310
I was going to say that you're
walking into like there's country.

774
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:40,091
It's crazy.

775
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:41,170
It's crazy.

776
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:42,190
The whole country.

777
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,960
Anyone want to leave
the kill at the board?

778
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,530
Oh yeah.

779
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,480
And there's so many slaves.

780
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,990
They have so many slaves and they have
these slave colonies where they're making

781
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:53,200
these people work for like
a half a bowl of rice a day.

782
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:54,490
They're starving to death.

783
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,710
They keep them just barely
above starving that.

784
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:58,390
They beat them to death constantly.

785
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,040
They feed them to dogs.

786
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,830
Like people that have
escaped have told stories.

787
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,640
There's the human rights violations
that we're hearing from North Korea,

788
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:06,820
like,

789
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,061
oh,

790
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:11,230
that shit about going to Iraq because
we're going over there to fucking protect

791
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:13,060
lives and enforce democracy.

792
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,400
If we really wanted to protect lives,

793
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,260
we would be in North Korea right now.

794
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,130
It will be North Korea.

795
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:18,880
We'd be in Syria.

796
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,271
Yeah,

797
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:19,780
you're right.

798
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,400
Those that don't that place,

799
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,300
especially North Korea,

800
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,550
I'm more familiar with that than I
am with what's going on in Syria,

801
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,640
but North Korea is a mess right now.

802
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:27,880
Yeah,

803
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,121
no,

804
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:28,841
absolutely.

805
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:33,610
Our our country is not a country that's
out there benevolently in country.

806
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:37,360
It's just really to protect the
business interests at hand and I'm like,

807
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,640
that's one of the things like,

808
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,040
you know,

809
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,210
which movie did you want to win?

810
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:40,840
The Oscar.

811
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,673
I'm curious.

812
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,700
I don't give a fuck about.

813
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:48,170
I think that awards for art or some of
the dumbest is to judge the judge are.

814
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm interested though,

815
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:50,720
just because I'm like,

816
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:50,901
well,

817
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:52,130
they pick the right one this year.

818
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:52,791
Do you know what I mean?

819
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:55,370
I'm really curious to see if one day
they'll do the right thing because I was

820
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:55,670
like,

821
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,960
Django was the best shit out.

822
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,150
A Django was the hardest
movie out this year.

823
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,013
It should have won.

824
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,160
That was a great movie.

825
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,510
He goes three hours and
never lost my intention.

826
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:06,500
I know that movie kept me going
the whole time to do argo.

827
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:06,741
Right.

828
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:08,770
You just basically recreating
some shit that happened.

829
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,290
You're a to see both of those movies.

830
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,500
The problem with those movies is they're
based on real events and they add a

831
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:17,040
bunch of bullshit and it's not real.

832
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,980
They add a bunch of bullshit to them and
when you add a bunch of bullshit like,

833
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,460
like the woman that was responsible for
everything and zero dark 30 that made

834
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:26,211
the whole thing happened,

835
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:26,930
you're going to go kill him.

836
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,320
For me,

837
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,370
that bitch didn't exist.

838
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,730
No,

839
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,600
she's not a real human.

840
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,140
Yeah,

841
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,020
you can't do that.

842
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,700
It's like you can't just add
people to historical movies.

843
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:35,470
That's crazy.

844
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,250
Unless if someone was
going to find in Latin,

845
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:38,120
it wouldn't be a ginger.

846
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,550
It might be the good decks.

847
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,060
Oh yeah.

848
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,681
I mean,

849
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:45,970
look,

850
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,480
the lady was a great actor.

851
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,250
The movie was very well done,

852
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,780
but I call shenanigans.

853
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,470
You can't just create a fucking fictional
character that figures it all out and

854
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:55,790
there was no George Bush like,

855
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,860
you're going to do the whole
fucking movie with no dumb ass.

856
00:24:57,861 --> 00:24:59,080
George fucking it up.

857
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,440
The whole thing was weird.

858
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,191
It was weird.

859
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:02,150
It was a weird movie,

860
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:02,510
man.

861
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,770
It was a very weird movie,

862
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,050
but I remember watching jangled.

863
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,330
I was like,

864
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,920
if this shit doesn't win the Oscars,

865
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,800
it's bullshit.

866
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,800
The Oscars is.

867
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,770
It is every year.

868
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,663
It's.

869
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,950
It's ridiculous.

870
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,850
The titanic was not a good movie.

871
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,460
Not a good movie.

872
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,423
It was good.

873
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,720
That was good about titanic.

874
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,760
Special effects were fucking incredible.

875
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:23,481
It was amazing.

876
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:27,740
It was a vehicle for showing
what's possible cinematically
with special effects

877
00:25:27,741 --> 00:25:29,270
in 19 whatever the fuck it was.

878
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,920
90 something to hear you talk about it,

879
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,560
but as far as like a script,

880
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,270
it's like really obvious,

881
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,133
you know,

882
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,070
it was hot trash,

883
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,780
more obvious than Avatar.

884
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,150
Avatar was knocked for being obvious,

885
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,510
but I thought Avatar was
even more creative with like
the crazy plants that you

886
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,440
can plug into.

887
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,420
The screenplay was slightly better,

888
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,531
slightly better,

889
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:51,680
and also avatar was actually
like in terms of special effects,

890
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,030
even more progressive,

891
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,130
even more avatar was on some shit.

892
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:57,380
It's almost like what
Cameron's movies are.

893
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:58,250
It's like they're like,

894
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:02,360
he doesn't stray too far from the path
when it comes to like a storyline,

895
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,730
but he provides you with
the state of the art shit.

896
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,860
He takes the bar and just just
blows it through the stratosphere.

897
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,290
No one came close to avatar yet.

898
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,090
Then movie's insane.

899
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:15,470
The visual experience,

900
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,050
especially if you go to imax three,

901
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,830
a motherfucker,

902
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,400
man,

903
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,610
just one of those dudes were popping
out of their little sleep tanks and

904
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:23,990
floating through the air and you're like,

905
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:24,410
this,

906
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,740
this movie is bad has.

907
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,120
Yeah.

908
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,730
I remember when I saw up in,

909
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:30,650
it was in three d and I was like
this the worst use of three d ever.

910
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,600
Like it just made the Asian Kid Chubbier

911
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:34,791
yeah,

912
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:37,310
there's some movies that don't
really do a good job with it.

913
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:39,500
But avatar was stunning.

914
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,350
It was.

915
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,870
It was more than just a movie.

916
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,141
I mean,

917
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:43,980
two best movies this
year was fucking Django

918
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,341
and wreck it.

919
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:45,540
Ralph wreck it.

920
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,840
Ralph was making movies.

921
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,630
I didn't even know what
you're talking about.

922
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,473
You got to watch.

923
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,320
What is it?

924
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,501
You know,

925
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:55,290
you will never have all your favorite
characters from fucking video games in a

926
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,160
video game world.

927
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:58,590
And it's animated feature about
all your favorite video game.

928
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,390
He might not like it because he's
not that big into the video games.

929
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,431
This was,

930
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,830
this was a release in the film.

931
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,330
Is this Disney?

932
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:07,950
Maybe Sarah Silverman is in it.

933
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,893
Uh,

934
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,750
John C dot reilly.

935
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,560
Hey.

936
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:10,861
Yeah.

937
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:11,694
It wasn't

938
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,680
until just now.

939
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,320
Yeah.

940
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,801
God Damn with.

941
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:15,780
There's too much to know.

942
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,460
Walk it,

943
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,293
watch it.

944
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,330
Watch it with the chick.

945
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:20,640
That's the closest one to
being your best chicken.

946
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:21,910
You're stable way.

947
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,530
You should watch them when I would
recommend watching it with your kids.

948
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:26,364
They might like it.

949
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,030
You think so?

950
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,450
Yeah.

951
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,170
Yeah.

952
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:29,591
Wow.

953
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:30,424
Okay.

954
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,483
Record.

955
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:32,350
It's all good.

956
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,040
It's got a car.

957
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,540
I haven't even heard of it before.

958
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:34,691
Oh,

959
00:27:34,691 --> 00:27:35,770
it's on itunes right now.

960
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,700
That's crazy,

961
00:27:36,701 --> 00:27:37,001
man.

962
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:40,930
When something is bad asking you haven't
even heard of it from street fighters

963
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:41,021
and.

964
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:41,170
Yeah,

965
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,340
that's the best is when you're like,

966
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:42,581
wait,

967
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:44,890
that missed me and now I have
something to do this weekend.

968
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,600
Fuck yeah.

969
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,900
Who are we talking to recently?

970
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:48,310
They never heard of grizzly man and

971
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:48,870
we're like,

972
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,703
what?

973
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,120
I don't know.

974
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,500
Have you heard of the documentary?

975
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:52,831
I have.

976
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:53,190
No.

977
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,020
Damn it son.

978
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,853
How can we?

979
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,250
But I'm also Chinese.

980
00:27:56,251 --> 00:27:59,370
One was this grizzly man fairly recently.

981
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,190
I kind of missed cultural
thing six years ago.

982
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:03,450
Maybe something like that.

983
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,630
You usually man is a movie
about a dude who lived bears.

984
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,080
Bears.

985
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,321
Yeah.

986
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,400
People told me about this,

987
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:11,850
but I was like,

988
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,720
I'm not interested.

989
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:13,950
It wasn't in the world journal.

990
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,450
Do you need a smoke a joint and
watch this and laugh by bear.

991
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,800
Laugh your dick off at this silly,

992
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,973
silly bitch.

993
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,060
This guy might be the silliest
bitch to ever go camping and yeah,

994
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:28,320
it was crazy and the bear ate him.

995
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,183
The end of the movie.

996
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,580
It's.

997
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,870
It's a fascinating.

998
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:33,030
It's because it's not meant to be funny.

999
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,380
It's a Werner Herzog film.

1000
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:34,911
Oh,

1001
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:35,250
okay.

1002
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,180
It's not meant to be funny,

1003
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,230
but it's just funny.

1004
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,780
I mean it's,

1005
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,590
it's like,

1006
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,950
like the Perfect Cohen brothers movie.

1007
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,630
You know how like Coen brothers movies.

1008
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:44,090
It's like dark and exit.

1009
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,520
Yeah,

1010
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,091
accidentally.

1011
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:45,391
Funny.

1012
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:45,841
Almost.

1013
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:46,370
It's like,

1014
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:50,090
like Fargo Fargo's amazing.

1015
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,331
Well,

1016
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:50,550
yeah.

1017
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,830
I didn't even understand
Fargo till I was 20.

1018
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,070
When you're younger and watching,

1019
00:28:55,071 --> 00:28:55,904
you're like,

1020
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,370
why do they do this?

1021
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,070
Fucking hate people

1022
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,561
die.

1023
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:06,030
All of you in the woodshop machine.

1024
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,060
What you get used to people
being bullshit artists.

1025
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:14,070
That's when the salesman and his fucking
coat become so much more entertaining.

1026
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,820
When you run into like one
of those bullshit salesmen
is just trying so hard to

1027
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:21,360
sell you this fucking bullshit that
you spray on the bottom of your car.

1028
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,790
You hit 19 and then you
just want to see people die.

1029
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,170
You want to see him die.

1030
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:26,850
It's so unfortunate.

1031
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:27,390
Why is that?

1032
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,141
Not all of them.

1033
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,410
Just the concept of the world.

1034
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,700
Just a useless Fox clogging
it up for everybody else.

1035
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,743
Yup.

1036
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,051
Yeah,

1037
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:35,070
but that,

1038
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,830
that movie was grizzly man is a must.

1039
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,660
It's a must.

1040
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,230
It's a must that you would
like to recommend to people.

1041
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,423
Do you have a must

1042
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,670
that you tell people like
you have to see this man?

1043
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:47,860
I mean this year was
record Ralph and Django,

1044
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,880
but before that,

1045
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,720
I mean it's been grizzly
man since I saw it.

1046
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,130
That's all I recommend to people,

1047
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,550
man know those ones this year,

1048
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,061
but no.

1049
00:29:58,061 --> 00:29:58,360
Yeah,

1050
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,770
I don't have like a go to market

1051
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,713
movie.

1052
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,720
Can you imagine how big a grizzly bear
is compared to that Werewolf out there?

1053
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,760
Do you know Greg would
fuck me up spirited boy.

1054
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,080
Fuck you up at a grizzly would eat
that werewolf a grizzly bear lake

1055
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,860
pitch.

1056
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,650
The grizzlies that were with me
that a man that was fucking big,

1057
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,160
great werewolf is like,

1058
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,540
that's the only like seven feet long.

1059
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,160
Have you seen spirited away?

1060
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,560
Why don't you tell me what that is?

1061
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,090
Spirited away is a animation
that Japanese animated film.

1062
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,370
Yeah,

1063
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,150
and it's really,

1064
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:32,110
really trippy and it's a real cool
animation to see why you're really stone.

1065
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:32,850
How old?

1066
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:33,690
How old is this?

1067
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,480
A 2001 I think.

1068
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,021
Oh,

1069
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:37,381
okay.

1070
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:38,340
I think I have seen that.

1071
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:39,174
Is that.

1072
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,620
What's the guy's name?

1073
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,713
Hey,

1074
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,300
rocky or something.

1075
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,610
Something like that is a good movie.

1076
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,593
Is this a good way?

1077
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,740
I do believe I've seen that.

1078
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,640
Another way to think about it,

1079
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:55,830
I think I have with the little girl and
the big cat and the faces and stuff.

1080
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,693
It's really cool.

1081
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,240
Yeah,

1082
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,631
I do.

1083
00:30:57,631 --> 00:30:58,530
I do think I've seen that.

1084
00:30:58,531 --> 00:30:59,220
Is that yours?

1085
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,520
That's what of always.

1086
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,360
That's one of my eye.

1087
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,230
I have movies I can watch
over and over and over again.

1088
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,210
That's one of them,

1089
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,660
like that's relaxing,

1090
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:06,971
you know?

1091
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:07,290
It does.

1092
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,110
It can get annoying because it's
so relaxing and calm and cool.

1093
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,150
Know that's the opposite of grizzly man.

1094
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,300
I thought Toronto was
pretty cool to the neutron.

1095
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:15,961
Did you really?

1096
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:16,800
You would recommend that?

1097
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:17,730
I wouldn't recommend it,

1098
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:19,080
but I think that year I might've been.

1099
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,390
That would have been in
my handful of movies.

1100
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:22,740
I just thought it was trippy to watch.

1101
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,021
Well,

1102
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:25,290
I think to use like it represented,

1103
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:25,651
you know,

1104
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:26,610
the old day,

1105
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,520
the old fan,

1106
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,910
if you're a fan,

1107
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:30,541
I can see it,

1108
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:31,560
but it was a piece of shit.

1109
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,220
Yeah,

1110
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,001
it was good to watch.

1111
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:35,130
The special effects were weird.

1112
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,300
It's like it was so obvious.

1113
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:37,860
It wasn't really a young him.

1114
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:40,620
It was like they did something to his
face and turn them into young adults.

1115
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,291
I mean,

1116
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,680
I guess the one film I recommend
that everyone is killa season.

1117
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,900
Cameron's Killa season.

1118
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:47,710
What does that do?

1119
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,210
Well,

1120
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,140
Santana's in all the
dips at dudes are in it.

1121
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,830
It's like the worst boots.

1122
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,250
Oh,

1123
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,820
you don't listen to the dip set.

1124
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,223
Oh

1125
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,600
Shit.

1126
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,433
What the dip set is.

1127
00:31:59,450 --> 00:31:59,600
No,

1128
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,820
y'all don't know the dip set.

1129
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,170
Y'All don't know the depths of my
grandfather's rolling over you.

1130
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,210
These fucking kids don't know the depths
just as my grandchild and y'all don't

1131
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,470
pull your pants up.

1132
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:14,830
I just put you on some shit,

1133
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:15,031
Joe,

1134
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:16,960
because you need to get
diplomatic immunity.

1135
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:20,860
One diplomatic immunity
to watch killa season.

1136
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,910
What am I killing?

1137
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,420
Dominican women's shooting
cocaine out of their assets.

1138
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:26,200
It's awesome.

1139
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,070
Did you guys.

1140
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,420
I was going to bring this up yesterday.

1141
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:33,220
Did you guys hear about this guy who got
arrested with a hundred bags of heroin

1142
00:32:33,221 --> 00:32:34,054
up his ass?

1143
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,730
Not hundred bags.

1144
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,170
100 bags.

1145
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,260
It was a traffic.

1146
00:32:38,261 --> 00:32:40,020
Stop this as hold him.

1147
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,220
You have a sink hole in your pants
or it's a 100 bags of heroin,

1148
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:46,910
man.

1149
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,350
100 man.

1150
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,090
Oh.

1151
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:49,923
Oh Jesus.

1152
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,580
Okay.

1153
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:51,880
I,

1154
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,461
I look.

1155
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:55,490
I look this killa season.

1156
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,061
No,

1157
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:56,241
no,

1158
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:56,780
this one.

1159
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,021
Okay.

1160
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:58,280
This guy just had one.

1161
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,551
Okay.

1162
00:32:58,551 --> 00:32:58,800
This,

1163
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,500
the other guy had it.

1164
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,333
His ass.

1165
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,050
One guy just had 200 bags.

1166
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:03,261
I'm like,

1167
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:06,950
did someone just take it to
the next level and go 200 bags.

1168
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:07,250
Oh,

1169
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,083
there we are.

1170
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,350
Wells right here.

1171
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,100
This is from lots of my
bag and this is a movie

1172
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,013
like,

1173
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,600
this is so amazing.

1174
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,260
This is a terrible woman.

1175
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,210
You're going to watch the

1176
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,340
clock work.

1177
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,420
Yeah.

1178
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,260
This is like that asap rocky song.

1179
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,213
They're playing right now.

1180
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:46,890
Yes.

1181
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,180
They are all from Harlem.

1182
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,990
All these dudes.

1183
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:49,823
Wow.

1184
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,510
You gotta you gotTa Watch Killa season.

1185
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,990
So this dude gets busted
on the palisades parkway.

1186
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:01,070
They pull them over in 2005 Mitsubishi
Lancer and he's acting real weird and so

1187
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:04,980
they decided to bring him in.

1188
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,270
So they bring him in and
they open up his ass.

1189
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,130
They just gave him a cavity check.

1190
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,450
I mean the guy didn't do anything wrong.

1191
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,680
Then they pulled them over.

1192
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:14,790
He just looked weird.

1193
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,110
He was tweaking out on his own.

1194
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,610
Something was going on with him.

1195
00:34:17,611 --> 00:34:18,710
Then he was pulled over.

1196
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:20,370
I mean routine traffic stop.

1197
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:21,450
But they,

1198
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,620
they detected the smell of
marijuana and that's where they,

1199
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,190
that's where they got them and they
brought him in because they smelled

1200
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:29,761
marijuana.

1201
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:30,480
That's it.

1202
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,790
And he had 100 bags of heroin,

1203
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:37,050
a disaster and you can't put 100 bags
of heroin up your ass while the cops are

1204
00:34:37,051 --> 00:34:38,340
going from their car to your car.

1205
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,511
You can't do that.

1206
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,670
So he was driving around with those.

1207
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:42,241
Packed up.

1208
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:43,074
Is that.

1209
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,440
Why would you drive around and smoke weed
with 100 packs of heroin in your ass?

1210
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,190
Well,

1211
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,870
I think he's just one of those guys.

1212
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,733
Maybe

1213
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:56,660
like Russian chicks will put ben Wa
balls and their pussy to tighten up their

1214
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:57,010
muscles.

1215
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:57,843
They're fuck muscle.

1216
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,900
Maybe this dude was just like exercising
his is asked or starfish that starfish

1217
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,750
or maybe he didn't trust his roommates.

1218
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:05,871
Like,

1219
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:06,111
man,

1220
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:07,710
if I leave this 100 bags of heroin,

1221
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,120
what the fuck is?

1222
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,900
He went to the gym.

1223
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,651
She's like,

1224
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:11,890
man,

1225
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,450
I can't fit it in my pocket.

1226
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,140
I can't leave.

1227
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,973
I

1228
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,490
can't leave it in my dash.

1229
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,930
Let's work on that starfish.

1230
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,650
The glove box is full

1231
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:23,960
mate.

1232
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,650
That just stuffed this up my ass.

1233
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,250
Hmm.

1234
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,450
Can I fit 100 bags?

1235
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,253
Let's see.

1236
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,420
Five.

1237
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,370
Six.

1238
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,730
Wow.

1239
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,520
Am I really going to get 94 years?

1240
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,100
Have you ever put anything
up your ass like like a pill

1241
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,933
or anything?

1242
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,833
Ever

1243
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,910
washcloth.

1244
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,340
Finger finger on the end of a wash.

1245
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:43,960
Washcloth.

1246
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,793
I've never gotten.

1247
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,170
Yeah,

1248
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,003
I cleaned it out.

1249
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,430
It seemed like a

1250
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,640
little soap.

1251
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,473
Little Polish.

1252
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,573
Interesting.

1253
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,260
Yeah.

1254
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,093
I've never done that.

1255
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,143
No view.

1256
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:58,870
No.

1257
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,470
I was just.

1258
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,880
I've never even taken a thermometer.

1259
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,721
The thermometer.

1260
00:36:01,721 --> 00:36:02,230
Yeah.

1261
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,980
I had a doctors stick a finger up my ass.

1262
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:05,970
I had to like,

1263
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,671
when you're a kid,

1264
00:36:06,671 --> 00:36:07,470
when you have a fever,

1265
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,400
they fucking put like advil in your ass.

1266
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:11,070
I think it's.

1267
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,170
I've never been into the girl
putting the finger in my ass.

1268
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:14,930
No,

1269
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:15,220
no.

1270
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,210
Never had that happen.

1271
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,650
But they say it's amazing.

1272
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,750
It's so I,

1273
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,271
I just,

1274
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:19,871
I don't want to go.

1275
00:36:19,871 --> 00:36:20,920
They're not gonna open.

1276
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:22,240
That post will be amazing though.

1277
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,420
It could be amazing prostate
massage thing and Ugh,

1278
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:30,980
shoot like a fucking broken fire hydrants.

1279
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,490
Yeah.

1280
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,870
I think you pretty much say

1281
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:37,800
so.

1282
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,750
The sponsor of the podcast

1283
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:46,260
for backslash Joe Rogan finger up the.com.

1284
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,193
I pinky

1285
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,030
don't ask name.

1286
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:51,650
Don't ask

1287
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,483
third finger.

1288
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,570
You can save yourself 10 percent off.

1289
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,110
Embarrassment because a girl,

1290
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:57,920
like if she's like,

1291
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,180
you want me to put a second and finger?

1292
00:36:59,181 --> 00:36:59,511
And you're like,

1293
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:00,200
yeah,

1294
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,920
yeah.

1295
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,753
What about third?

1296
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,001
Okay.

1297
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,430
No,

1298
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,140
no,

1299
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,500
no.

1300
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,250
You're fucked up.

1301
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,060
What's wrong with you?

1302
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,610
You want three fingers up his ass.

1303
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,001
Oh,

1304
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:09,070
you need to get out.

1305
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,090
Need a better man in your life.

1306
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,400
You'll get out of Pittsburgh.

1307
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,550
You've never had a girl try.

1308
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,660
I've had to go try.

1309
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,550
Always try.

1310
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,420
Like jokingly said,

1311
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:20,290
we never let it happen.

1312
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,561
Oh No,

1313
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:20,681
no,

1314
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:21,190
no.

1315
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,401
Never,

1316
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:21,850
never.

1317
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,840
Some cement.

1318
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:23,431
That tickles.

1319
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:24,310
It makes me feel gross.

1320
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:28,210
I'm one of the people that believe
or subscribe into the thing that,

1321
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:28,680
uh,

1322
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,990
that there's no.

1323
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,120
You're not allowed to look at it.

1324
00:37:31,121 --> 00:37:31,990
You're not allowed to see it.

1325
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,243
Smell it.

1326
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:33,701
Touch it.

1327
00:37:33,701 --> 00:37:35,130
I don't want anything around my ass.

1328
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,183
I don't know why.

1329
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:37,841
Hey Man.

1330
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:38,700
Whatever it is,

1331
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,753
it's good.

1332
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,870
It's probably a mess.

1333
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,351
I mean,

1334
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:42,160
I don't see

1335
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,070
like grooming.

1336
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,440
I don't see you getting down
there with a fucking mirror.

1337
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:46,990
And uh,

1338
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,350
a big three blade.

1339
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,540
Who has time for that?

1340
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:51,370
Joe Polish and that area up nice.

1341
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,170
Cleaning it up a company.

1342
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,390
No.

1343
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:55,751
No.

1344
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:56,440
But meanwhile

1345
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,600
girls go in 69 and you her eyeball.

1346
00:37:58,601 --> 00:38:03,370
So like fucking inches away from that
dirty disaster of an asshole of yours.

1347
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,840
Do you let girls eat your ass?

1348
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:06,670
Do you ever.

1349
00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:07,350
Have you ever had.

1350
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,180
Never had that

1351
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,400
have?

1352
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,580
I've had girls get to
the balls and the taint,

1353
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:14,590
but I've never had a girl that nom nom nom

1354
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,543
my ass.

1355
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,430
And you get asked.

1356
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,060
I've seen it in porn.

1357
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,450
I've seen.

1358
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:19,710
Yeah,

1359
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,210
corn I've looked at certain things
we can't discuss in this program with

1360
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,800
websites is one of them.

1361
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,401
I know.

1362
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:27,590
I mean being the prior,

1363
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,130
that's even less,

1364
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,360
even less likely to be brought up a
chicks don't want to hear about that.

1365
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,990
So it was okay to eat
before we were married.

1366
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,950
I didn't even know you.

1367
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,150
I didn't know you existed.

1368
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,850
I ate a little ass before
I knew you existed.

1369
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:41,923
Whatever.

1370
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,750
You couldn't have waited
until it was the special one.

1371
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,100
Even couldn't have waited.

1372
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,560
Eating ass is something that
came later to me in life.

1373
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:48,801
Like,

1374
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:48,990
you know,

1375
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:49,930
like blue cheese,

1376
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,040
you don't like blue cheese most of
your life and one day you're like,

1377
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,341
you know,

1378
00:38:52,341 --> 00:38:53,001
this is really good.

1379
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:54,200
Like I didn't like eating out now.

1380
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:55,270
I love eating the girl's ass.

1381
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:56,300
It's one of my favorite things ever.

1382
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,030
Well how long ago did this start?

1383
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,480
Uh,

1384
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:00,900
like,

1385
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,410
like when you started dating freaks now
as you went through the Brian Red Band,

1386
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:07,500
you went into your brian red band
freak period a few years back.

1387
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,620
It's coincidentally right when
we started doing this podcast.

1388
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,810
Yeah,

1389
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,640
I think it was right around that time.

1390
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:14,500
Maybe you're right before

1391
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:17,890
ducted into the world with
girls with troubled childhoods.

1392
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,120
And then boom,

1393
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,530
we're off to the race 33,

1394
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,760
33 or 34 years.

1395
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,590
You were off to the races.

1396
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,440
And the problem is when you,

1397
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,520
you deal with like the
world of Uber Freak,

1398
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,010
professional sex workers essentially,

1399
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:31,761
you know,

1400
00:39:31,761 --> 00:39:32,600
that's what you're dealing with.

1401
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,470
And then to try to go from that to
like some girl who was working on her

1402
00:39:36,471 --> 00:39:37,460
accounting degree,

1403
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,950
you know,

1404
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,590
it is it,

1405
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,550
is there any hope?

1406
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,030
Are you spoil,

1407
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,480
right?

1408
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,610
Yeah,

1409
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,250
you're fucked.

1410
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:44,441
Well,

1411
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:44,850
you know,

1412
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,420
look man,

1413
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,200
let's be honest.

1414
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,910
Your baton quite a bit over your head.

1415
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:48,930
And uh,

1416
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,620
that's hard to keep going in the regular
world because in the regular world

1417
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,650
girls will eventually get
mad at you in the porn world.

1418
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,360
They're just happy that they have a man.

1419
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,500
Like they're happy that someone's there
for them and someone loves them and

1420
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,390
someone doesn't just treat them as
something that just come inside of,

1421
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:03,980
you know,

1422
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,910
so they want to be
cuddled and taken care of.

1423
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,610
Really can watch nickelodeon.

1424
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:11,110
You don't go watch nickelodeon.

1425
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,660
Like once you've seen all the other shit,

1426
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,890
you don't go watch nickelodeon.

1427
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,660
I love Doug at the time,

1428
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:17,920
but I don't want dog anymore.

1429
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,370
There's,

1430
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,930
there's a style

1431
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:25,390
super sexual woman that you're only
going to get from a chick that's like

1432
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:26,860
probably willing to do porn.

1433
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,280
Like a girl who wants to
have threesomes with you.

1434
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:29,861
Grow once,

1435
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,290
eat your ass while you're
fucking another guy or girl.

1436
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,453
I'm just telling you,

1437
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:41,190
you're going to have to go against
what I'm trying to sound like.

1438
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,150
It's not going to work out.

1439
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,680
Get the final frontier for you.

1440
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,451
For Real.

1441
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:46,800
I think that like,

1442
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,030
you know,

1443
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,430
like if you just want to fuck,

1444
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:50,741
okay.

1445
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:54,330
And that's on it's way more fun
to just date a bunch of freaks,

1446
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,020
you know?

1447
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,411
I mean,

1448
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:59,850
if you're just trying to fuck the problem
is if you want to really settle down

1449
00:40:59,851 --> 00:41:00,930
and have a relationship,

1450
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,320
a lot of girls who have been involved
in the adult industry in quotes,

1451
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:11,130
they've vet a fucked up past
and you're dealing with like,

1452
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,640
do you think if a woman,

1453
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:17,530
do you think if a woman's a Nympho and
you date an info for like a year and a

1454
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:17,531
half,

1455
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:18,300
two years,

1456
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:18,550
that,

1457
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:23,140
that you would then become a Nympho
because you have to be on her same.

1458
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,620
It's like,

1459
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,453
you know,

1460
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,930
I think it's a theme park that you leave.

1461
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,573
Yeah,

1462
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,591
I like that.

1463
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:32,670
That's a good way of looking at it.

1464
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:33,230
Yeah.

1465
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,063
Some girls,

1466
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,920
there's some girls I dated a girl,

1467
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:37,670
ones that couldn't come to,

1468
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:38,240
couldn't come.

1469
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,500
Like she never had orgasms,

1470
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,000
but she wanted to fuck all the time.

1471
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,650
It was craziness.

1472
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,610
They want to keep trying,

1473
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:47,270
but she couldn't do it like she
did like and everybody says,

1474
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:47,601
Oh,

1475
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:49,310
you just didn't know how to make her come.

1476
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,320
She didn't even know how to make her come.

1477
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,910
Like nobody knew how to make her come.

1478
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,700
She could never finger
herself and make herself calm.

1479
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,210
There was like one way where
she could get herself to come,

1480
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,520
but it was really hard
and it didn't always work,

1481
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:02,354
but it was

1482
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,363
the whole thing was,

1483
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,580
it was a real crazy sort of situation
because you knew that sex feels good for

1484
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:11,510
her,

1485
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,760
but you always felt guilty
because she couldn't come.

1486
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,780
She'd get wet and shit.

1487
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,130
She loved to fuck.

1488
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,300
That was the crazy thing.

1489
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,430
It's like something was off,

1490
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,473
you know,

1491
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,950
but she wanted to fuck all the time.

1492
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,580
But if you date a girl who wants to fuck
all the time and then you date a girl

1493
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,750
doesn't want to fuck all the time,

1494
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,910
especially if you're used
to it and you like it,

1495
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:29,780
you like,

1496
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,040
um,

1497
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,521
hey,

1498
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:36,350
but you're awake and I'm awake and we're
right here and we can just take our

1499
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:37,260
clothes off and fuck it.

1500
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,113
Why wouldn't we do that?

1501
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,140
I don't want it.

1502
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,351
Like,

1503
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:39,800
whoa.

1504
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,350
That doesn't even make sense to a dude.

1505
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,691
No,

1506
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:42,680
that's a useless.

1507
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,060
That's a useless partner.

1508
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:44,451
Yeah,

1509
00:42:44,451 --> 00:42:45,290
to a dude.

1510
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,830
It's like,

1511
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,410
we'll have.

1512
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:49,520
The third thing is we supposed to be
looking for as many opportunities as

1513
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:50,480
possible to fuck.

1514
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,780
That's why we're boyfriend,

1515
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:52,250
girlfriend.

1516
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:52,770
Right.

1517
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,960
So what are we doing here?

1518
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:54,910
You don't want to talk.

1519
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:55,611
Okay.

1520
00:42:55,611 --> 00:42:56,271
You don't want to fuck,

1521
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:57,590
but there's nothing holding you back.

1522
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,960
You're not fucking talking
and then you're in trouble.

1523
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,670
But if nothing's holding you back,

1524
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,720
like it's not like you have.

1525
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:02,960
Like,

1526
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,280
I would love to fuck right now,

1527
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,290
but I have to go to work,

1528
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,590
you know,

1529
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,251
I have to leave.

1530
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:07,850
I'm late.

1531
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:08,683
That's one thing.

1532
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:09,590
But if it's like,

1533
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:09,741
oh,

1534
00:43:09,741 --> 00:43:10,574
I'm not in the mood.

1535
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,270
Yeah,

1536
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:11,541
okay.

1537
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:12,290
You got to get rid of that.

1538
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:12,981
Like the summer.

1539
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:14,900
There's nothing on HBO
and we're not fucking.

1540
00:43:14,901 --> 00:43:15,734
That's a problem.

1541
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,210
Yeah,

1542
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,043
you got to get rid of that.

1543
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:17,930
That's,

1544
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:22,040
that's where probably gay dudes
understanding each other more better.

1545
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,233
Like they probably,

1546
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,920
they probably just give up the ass.

1547
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,070
They tell you the guy at starbucks,

1548
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,330
we were talking about Grindr.

1549
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:30,890
Uh,

1550
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:31,630
he,

1551
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,790
he had the hat on.

1552
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:32,920
Yeah,

1553
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,600
because I had the hat.

1554
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,670
I wear this grinder hat just
for fun once in a while.

1555
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:36,863
It's a bad idea.

1556
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:37,883
But uh,

1557
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:38,670
the guy goes,

1558
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:39,051
oh man,

1559
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:39,421
it's so funny.

1560
00:43:39,421 --> 00:43:39,841
You have the Grindr.

1561
00:43:39,841 --> 00:43:41,100
I use grindr every day.

1562
00:43:41,101 --> 00:43:41,550
He's like,

1563
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:41,791
he's like,

1564
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:44,190
I've used it three times
this weekend so far.

1565
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:44,521
And I was like,

1566
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:44,950
what are you doing?

1567
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:45,330
He goes,

1568
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:45,511
oh,

1569
00:43:45,511 --> 00:43:46,200
it's just like,

1570
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:46,561
hey,

1571
00:43:46,561 --> 00:43:48,810
there's a guy at
pavilions down the street,

1572
00:43:48,811 --> 00:43:50,380
the grocery store he wants to,

1573
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,630
he's down to fuck right now.

1574
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,531
I could go with him,

1575
00:43:52,531 --> 00:43:55,200
we can go fuck in the car somewhere
in a back alley or get a blow job.

1576
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,820
And then I come back to work,

1577
00:43:56,821 --> 00:43:57,031
you know,

1578
00:43:57,031 --> 00:43:57,864
it's,

1579
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:58,743
wow.

1580
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:00,623
They're lucky.

1581
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,130
Well you can definitely
look at it that way,

1582
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,293
but they have the.

1583
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,320
But during the Dick.

1584
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:05,710
Yeah.

1585
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:06,131
That's a,

1586
00:44:06,131 --> 00:44:06,940
that's a fail.

1587
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,773
Yeah.

1588
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,070
I mean don't you think about that even
when a girl's willing to fuck you,

1589
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,630
like when you have sex with your girl?

1590
00:44:13,631 --> 00:44:14,140
Don't.

1591
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,951
I always think like,

1592
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:15,970
why do you like Dick?

1593
00:44:15,971 --> 00:44:16,150
Like,

1594
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,871
what is going on here?

1595
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:17,740
Why do you like dudes?

1596
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:17,891
Like,

1597
00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:18,100
what?

1598
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,330
Why would you like a guy?

1599
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:19,721
Like,

1600
00:44:19,721 --> 00:44:20,554
I don't get it.

1601
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,200
I don't understand the
attraction to a man,

1602
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:23,990
you know?

1603
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,240
So when I'm just glad they liked it,

1604
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:26,651
medium,

1605
00:44:26,651 --> 00:44:26,940
Asian,

1606
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,773
Dick.

1607
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,570
Not saying that there's anything wrong

1608
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,420
with,

1609
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:34,840
you know,

1610
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,120
being a heterosexual woman.

1611
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,950
All I'm saying is I don't understand it.

1612
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,580
Just like you wouldn't understand
like being a gay dude either,

1613
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,490
but if you were so afflicted with
that predilection and you did,

1614
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,530
that's what you enjoyed?

1615
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:46,831
Yeah,

1616
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:47,130
I would,

1617
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,630
I would imagine that's a freer life.

1618
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:49,180
I,

1619
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:49,680
I just,

1620
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,000
I just loved that they love it.

1621
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,320
Like I'm really glad you liked the
shit because I got a lot of it.

1622
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,453
There's a,

1623
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,860
there's a gay couple down the street from
me and they're like trying to fit in.

1624
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,550
I mean they do fit in great neighbors
but they're trying to fit in like a

1625
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,950
regular family.

1626
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:10,340
Like they adopted a kid and you know,

1627
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:10,690
they,

1628
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,400
they do all the same shit
that regular families do.

1629
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:13,791
You know,

1630
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:17,930
not that there's anything unregular about
what is something unregular about two

1631
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,220
gay dudes obviously,

1632
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,840
but as one of them can't get pregnant,

1633
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:21,770
it's totally great.

1634
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,140
The thing is is like you shouldn't
try to fit in like you're Asian,

1635
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:25,561
you're black,

1636
00:45:25,561 --> 00:45:25,981
you're gay.

1637
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:26,671
Like just be.

1638
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:28,230
That was great,

1639
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:29,201
but I mean when,

1640
00:45:29,201 --> 00:45:30,400
I mean by trying to fit in,

1641
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,660
I shouldn't have probably
said it that way,

1642
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:33,190
but what I meant was that there,

1643
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,640
you know,

1644
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,770
they live like a normal family.

1645
00:45:35,771 --> 00:45:38,980
They're like they're gay
married couple with a kid,

1646
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:39,720
you know,

1647
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,680
a lot of people have a
hard time with that man.

1648
00:45:41,681 --> 00:45:41,860
It's,

1649
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,760
it's really interesting.

1650
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,290
But I think here like
California is probably as loose
as it gets with how people

1651
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:48,370
like view that.

1652
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,500
I don't know what kind
of grief they catch,

1653
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:55,330
but all the people that I know around
them are like totally normal with it,

1654
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,630
but you know,

1655
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:00,310
it's like if they wanted to,

1656
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:04,300
any one of those guys could just
drive down Santa Monica Boulevard,

1657
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,270
just enter into one of those clubs.

1658
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,270
Just pull your cock out and
just get the grinder on,

1659
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:10,900

1660
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,190

1661
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,263
Right.

1662
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,480
I mean that's a,

1663
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,250
there's no place like that for dudes now
because there's no place like that for

1664
00:46:18,251 --> 00:46:22,150
guys where you can just guarantee that
you could go and there'd be a bunch of

1665
00:46:22,151 --> 00:46:23,770
horny checks looking for dudes.

1666
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,160
See,

1667
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,370
in New York there are places
like Bob in the lower east side,

1668
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,220
you go and there's always like
a fat chick waiting for you.

1669
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,210
What is Bob?

1670
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:36,420
Bob is like 500 square foot hip hop
like lounge situation and the lower east

1671
00:46:37,481 --> 00:46:38,050
side.

1672
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:39,100
They play all golden era.

1673
00:46:39,101 --> 00:46:39,371
Hip Hop.

1674
00:46:39,371 --> 00:46:39,791
You go in,

1675
00:46:39,791 --> 00:46:40,630
everyone's sweating,

1676
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:44,950
dancing and you always get
asked and Okcupid is amazing.

1677
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,501
Like I,

1678
00:46:45,501 --> 00:46:47,080
I abused with Okcupid.

1679
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,790
Okcupid is like a website.

1680
00:46:48,791 --> 00:46:50,110
You go on and you can literally,

1681
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,850
people have boxes like
just looking to fuck.

1682
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:56,960
It's like Grindr for
heterosexuals for any sexuals.

1683
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,100
Like you could have three eyes and find
some other fuck with three eyes and

1684
00:47:00,101 --> 00:47:00,670
wants to fuck.

1685
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:00,910
Yeah,

1686
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,830
but they're almost the same people.

1687
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:05,020
If you go to Craig's list and
just like look in your area,

1688
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:08,200
like looking to fuck type girls and
then sometimes there's a picture.

1689
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:09,820
There's never been one that I've gone,

1690
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:10,840
oh my God,

1691
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:11,291
yes,

1692
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:13,630
I need to fuck this girl that I've.

1693
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,120
I've had one on Okcupid.

1694
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,740
I found a unicorn that was pretty good.

1695
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:19,421
They'll tell us like,

1696
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:19,840
what happened?

1697
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,650
It was bad,

1698
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:21,483
it was dope,

1699
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:22,300
it was dope.

1700
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,610
I ended up taking this
Unicorn to vegas once.

1701
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,503
It was good.

1702
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:26,860
It's a lot of fun.

1703
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,550
Well,

1704
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:27,670
I

1705
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:28,870
think that they exist.

1706
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:33,850
I know that there's probably a lot of
girls that are super hot that would love

1707
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,560
to freak a guy out like that.

1708
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,710
A guy couldn't believe how hot they
are and they just want to fuck.

1709
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,450
There's a lot of crazy bitches like that.

1710
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,343
There's a lot of them.

1711
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:41,591
Well,

1712
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:45,100
in New York there's a lot of girls at
work and they don't have time to go out

1713
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:47,110
and date and meet dudes and
pick them and they're like,

1714
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:47,610
you know what,

1715
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:48,070
I just,

1716
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:51,600
I just need to sit on something and you
just sit on something and just needed to

1717
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:52,434
get their dick on.

1718
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,230
You know?

1719
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,040
It's great.

1720
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,940
It's would be great.

1721
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,030
It's fucking awesome.

1722
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:56,800
You guys need that,

1723
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,000
do you?

1724
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,480
Don't you have OK cupid out here.

1725
00:47:58,481 --> 00:47:59,710
I'm sure you have OK cupid here.

1726
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:00,640
They have it in Boston.

1727
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:01,603
Yeah.

1728
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,010
Too many crazy bitches out here.

1729
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,873
It's just too dangerous.

1730
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,380
I get a positive outcome.

1731
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,020
Positive HIV positive.

1732
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,253
That is.

1733
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,450
Did you hear about that dude?

1734
00:48:12,451 --> 00:48:13,050

00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,570

Yeah.

1738
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:21,000
He was picking them up on
Christian mingle and raping them.

1739
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:21,920
Wow.

1740
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,600

Do you think so?

1749
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,130

00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:32,991

00:48:32,991 --> 00:48:33,410

Yes.

1760
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:43,810
Jewish Turks.

1761
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,830
Yes.

1762
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:45,640

1764
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:47,321
Well.

1765
00:48:47,321 --> 00:48:48,370
Two Jewish girls.

1766
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:48,980
Yeah,

1767
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,691
I really do.

1768
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:51,580
I've hopped a awesome.

1769
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:52,503
How many of you?

1770
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,930
Probably like five and
they've all been awesome.

1771
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,463
Crazy.

1772
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:58,341
The head game,

1773
00:48:58,341 --> 00:49:00,080
the Jewish head game is the best.

1774
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,193
Yeah.

1775
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,530
It's absolutely known Jewish girls.

1776
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:04,460
Give the best head.

1777
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:05,070
Yeah.

1778
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:05,903
When they do it.

1779
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,133
Yeah.

1780
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,193
Yes.

1781
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,480
Then there's that old joke.

1782
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,250
How do you stop a Jewish
check from blowing you?

1783
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,220
Killer barrier.

1784
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:15,263
Oh,

1785
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,493
that's a good one.

1786
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,001
Yeah.

1787
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:20,550
I think it's,

1788
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,290
isn't it because like they are,

1789
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:26,250
so since they're young they're always
said you have to only have sex with Jewish

1790
00:49:26,251 --> 00:49:29,430
people and you never supposed to be
with anyone outside of your race.

1791
00:49:29,431 --> 00:49:31,920
And I think that's why
they're so crazy in bed.

1792
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:32,910
Maybe you think so.

1793
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,350
Yeah,

1794
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:33,990
I know.

1795
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,780
I'm just guessing not as suppressed.

1796
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,500
There's a,

1797
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,430
there's a less suppression
in that religion than there
is like sexually in like

1798
00:49:41,431 --> 00:49:43,050
Catholicism and you know,

1799
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:44,580
a lot of other Christian religions.

1800
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,300
It might be the Hitler Christ
am I wear all the time.

1801
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,143
And he said,

1802
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,370
I want to hate.

1803
00:49:48,371 --> 00:49:48,730
Fuck you.

1804
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:53,020
I just figured they thought there
was money in the Dick Sucking on it.

1805
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:53,854
Hard enough.

1806
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:54,843
Half dollars

1807
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:55,803
first.

1808
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:58,321
What are you doing?

1809
00:49:58,321 --> 00:49:58,540

1812
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,033

1813
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:06,290
Jamie's over there playing with him.

1814
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,120
So,

1815
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:07,953
um,

1816
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:08,430
yeah,

1817
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:09,600
the first Jewish girl I did it,

1818
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:10,434
I was 21.

1819
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:11,950
That was first,

1820
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:14,010
like pitch was not.

1821
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,173
She was great.

1822
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:15,961
I was like Whoa.

1823
00:50:15,961 --> 00:50:16,794
But she was like,

1824
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,753
she was a woman.

1825
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,391
I was 21,

1826
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,224
she was 25,

1827
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,070
she wasn't time.

1828
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,120
That's a woman.

1829
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,870
It wasn't a girl in the cougar was
the first time I ever dated a woman as

1830
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:27,470
opposed to like every chick
that I dated before was 20.

1831
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:28,880
One was like 19,

1832
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:29,451
20,

1833
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:30,380
like my age.

1834
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,760
They were like little kids,

1835
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,241
you know.

1836
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:33,200
This girl was like,

1837
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:33,650
you know,

1838
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,810
college graduates,

1839
00:50:34,811 --> 00:50:37,450
serious woman had a career and was.

1840
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,570
It was totally different.

1841
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:38,901
Bang.

1842
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:39,561
A chick like that.

1843
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:41,030
It's a completely different experience.

1844
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:42,290
Like they're not.

1845
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,123
They're not shy.

1846
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:43,720
No,

1847
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:43,940
no.

1848
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,990
I've never gotten older.

1849
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:46,630
I've always gotten younger.

1850
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,513
Yeah.

1851
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,740
That was the only time I ever did.

1852
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:50,000
Maybe one of the time.

1853
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:50,811
One of the time I did it,

1854
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:52,070
the girl was like a year older than me,

1855
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,730
which is acceptable and I
want to do a cougar once.

1856
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,300
I just think I see some because there's
so many hot cougars here in Los Angeles

1857
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:00,443
to join a gym.

1858
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,270
If you want to get a real cougar,

1859
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,170
you got to join a gym.

1860
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,590
I'm a teddy bear.

1861
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,550
Teddy bear with muscles.

1862
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:07,910
Joe.

1863
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:08,061
No,

1864
00:51:08,061 --> 00:51:11,210
I'm saying if you want to really meet
the ones that you actually want to fuck,

1865
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:14,300
you got to meet the ones that are at the
gym because the ones that go to the gym

1866
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:17,480
or the ones who still have the
plump passes and they're like 50.

1867
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,900
I've seen tricks with great assets
that are 50 and you can't believe it.

1868
00:51:20,901 --> 00:51:21,830
It's like God damn.

1869
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:22,340
Why?

1870
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,820
Because that bitch is addicted to
spin class and she's in there the fuck

1871
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:28,500
that girl drone.

1872
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,080
I got the crazy ass.

1873
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:31,610
Tighten up those muscles.

1874
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,790
I'm talking about girls that
have their home gyms at Malibu.

1875
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,020
They don't leave the house.

1876
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:36,890
I come to.

1877
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,260
Those bitches are weak and
they're going to pass out on you.

1878
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:43,310
They're going to faint and fall and hit
their fucking head on the marble and

1879
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:44,600
then you're going to
get charged with murder.

1880
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:45,770
Trust me,

1881
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,940
keep away from those pictures.

1882
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,710
Keep away from those tired,

1883
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,341
tired,

1884
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:50,360
low blood sugar.

1885
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,490
Melba bitches never leave the house.

1886
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:53,710
Walk around their fucking sweat.

1887
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:56,510
That's put your shoes on and
get the fuck out of the house.

1888
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:57,680
Like Pamela Anderson.

1889
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,311
Yeah,

1890
00:51:58,311 --> 00:52:02,580
you don't want that one because I was
lazy and that asked is gone a long gone

1891
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:03,423
ass son.

1892
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,820
She was a beautiful,

1893
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:05,930
beautiful young lady,

1894
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,020
but someone stole her ass
when she hit about 43,

1895
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:11,330
44 a Goblin came into the house.

1896
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,070
Now she just looks crazy.

1897
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,660
She looked like Barbara streisand.

1898
00:52:14,661 --> 00:52:15,110
Now,

1899
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:18,740
isn't it weird how she women
really beautiful woman.

1900
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,800
If they get crazy with their looks fake.

1901
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,670
If they start shooting shit in their face,

1902
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,640
they go from being beautiful
to being repulsive.

1903
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,150
Yeah,

1904
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,731
and it's not.

1905
00:52:26,731 --> 00:52:27,890
A lot of time they do it,

1906
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:30,320
you know it's going to
happen and they still do it.

1907
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:31,610
Psychological Shit.

1908
00:52:31,611 --> 00:52:32,120
It's like,

1909
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,240
like people that are anorexic
and they can't help it.

1910
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:37,970
They get just keep losing
weight or big bodybuilder dudes,

1911
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,860
big bodybuilder dudes like I've,

1912
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,050
I've met guys that are huge and they,

1913
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,340
they're scared to go outside.

1914
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:44,810
They want to cover their body,

1915
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,530
their muscles up like big puffy sweaters
and shit because they don't want people

1916
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:49,160
to know how,

1917
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,180
how small they are.

1918
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,500
Wow.

1919
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:51,711
Yeah.

1920
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:52,520
They get nutty.

1921
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,230
Yeah.

1922
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:55,010
Especially like those competitive ones.

1923
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,570
People who like enter into
bodybuilding competitions,

1924
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,270
they never feel like they're big enough.

1925
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:01,350
It's a dysmorphia body images,

1926
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,360
some fucked up shit.

1927
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:07,310
It's very psychologically like you have
no idea how much it fucking controls

1928
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:07,580
you.

1929
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,270
We're lucky there's not a dick operation
that you could do to your dick with a

1930
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,530
chick dust or tense because

1931
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:16,371
listen man,

1932
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:20,750
I've researched it could take a piece
of your foot either research he looking

1933
00:53:20,751 --> 00:53:21,240
into.

1934
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,370
I researched today.

1935
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,450
I'm happy with my dad.

1936
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,590
I'll tell you right now.

1937
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,950
So of the biggest dick in the world,

1938
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:26,040
but

1939
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,120
it's mine and I like it.

1940
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,140
I like medium.

1941
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:29,130
Dick is great,

1942
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,270
but this.

1943
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,420
I'm like the body dysmorphia
that some women have.

1944
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:35,730
Like there was a woman that I knew many,

1945
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:38,640
many a year ago who had a
ridiculously large breasts,

1946
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,700
fake tits and she wanted to get
a bigger and all of her friends,

1947
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,200
like you can't do that.

1948
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:44,034
Stop it.

1949
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:44,730
Like you can't choose.

1950
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,080
I just want them a little bigger.

1951
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:46,973
Just a little bit.

1952
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:47,281
I mean,

1953
00:53:47,281 --> 00:53:49,380
they were fucking huge.

1954
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,490
There were crazy,

1955
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:51,210
huge,

1956
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,043
crazy,

1957
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:52,501
crazy.

1958
00:53:52,501 --> 00:53:52,741
Who's.

1959
00:53:52,741 --> 00:53:54,030
They don't look crazy good.

1960
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,420
No,

1961
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,740
they look crazy bad.

1962
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:56,963
Crazy.

1963
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,770
It looked like they felt like a knee
getting breast reductions make no sense to

1964
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:01,891
me.

1965
00:54:01,891 --> 00:54:03,270
Like you're just giving money away.

1966
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:04,140
Well,

1967
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,980
I think for some girls I dated a girl who.

1968
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:08,191
Yeah,

1969
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:08,640
she had an.

1970
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,510
Before I met her.

1971
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:11,130
She had had a breast reduction.

1972
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:15,240
She had enormous tits and even when I
met her they were like d cups and I was

1973
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:15,350
like,

1974
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:15,771
oh my God,

1975
00:54:15,771 --> 00:54:16,604
they were bigger than this.

1976
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,840
Like she had like back pain.

1977
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:20,280
So she would get pinched nerves and shit.

1978
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:21,480
Like they just can go numb,

1979
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:25,300
but still I feel like you have tits
that big things will happen for you.

1980
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:26,580
You know,

1981
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,690
other things will take care of.

1982
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,820
Someone will come on and that's it.

1983
00:54:29,821 --> 00:54:33,210
It's not like they come fucking bean
stocks and take it to the match.

1984
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,340
If you have a herniated disc
and I come on your back,

1985
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:36,440
it doesn't help much.

1986
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,280
Not doing anybody any good.

1987
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:39,820
It's not like you're rubbing it in.

1988
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,000
It's Vicks Vapor Rub,

1989
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,620
heal the injury.

1990
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:47,310
I've talked about this before that I
know somebody who has that disease.

1991
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,570
I don't remember the name of it,

1992
00:54:48,571 --> 00:54:48,920
where they're.

1993
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,760
Your tits are crazy big like,

1994
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,200
like they're almost worms,

1995
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,300
like 10 scientists.

1996
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,540
Titus of the tips.

1997
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:54,780
Yeah,

1998
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,561
exactly.

1999
00:54:55,561 --> 00:54:56,850
And it's so big that she,

2000
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:57,870
if you look at her,

2001
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:59,370
she looks like she's really fat,

2002
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,160
but then she takes off her shirt
and just holds up her tits.

2003
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:02,550
It's like,

2004
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:02,881
oh no,

2005
00:55:02,881 --> 00:55:05,120
it's all just tit and body like sand.

2006
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:07,530
So how big would you say her?

2007
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,810
Like twice a normal tip.

2008
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,770
Uh,

2009
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:15,770
I would say each one of
her tits was probably a,

2010
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:17,130
I don't know,

2011
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,670
24 inches long and a 24 inch.

2012
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,330
Probably each one weighed
probably I'd say about 50 pounds.

2013
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,590
Oh my God.

2014
00:55:25,591 --> 00:55:26,281
The poor girl,

2015
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,114
she had 100 pounds.

2016
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,230
She still has it too.

2017
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,270
She,

2018
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:29,671
she can't.

2019
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:33,420
She has to get these like crazy browse
made it sears where they have to make the

2020
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:33,930
Bra.

2021
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,230
I'm telling you that we're,

2022
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:38,340
we're lucky there's not a dick operation
like that where you can get bigger.

2023
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:39,174
Dick.

2024
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,670
Has Anybody ever had a Dick Reduction?

2025
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:44,250
Zimmer Dude had like a 24
inch Dick and they'll listen.

2026
00:55:44,251 --> 00:55:45,600
No girls can suck this.

2027
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:47,070
I'm tired of this bullshit.

2028
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,240
Cut me down to 10.

2029
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:49,201
I would never,

2030
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:49,471
man,

2031
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,790
I could have a three foot dick.

2032
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,710
I would never cut that.

2033
00:55:51,711 --> 00:55:53,070
It's fucking excalibur.

2034
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:54,700
Don't touch excalibur.

2035
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:55,860
Who's going to fuck you?

2036
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:57,870
You're going to have to have chicks.

2037
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:01,950
I know that you have like a
fucking three foot like baby arm.

2038
00:56:01,951 --> 00:56:05,490
You're going to have to only date chicks
that fuck basketball players and had

2039
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:09,450
their babies or kill 12 pound
babies came out of there.

2040
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,030
Now it's not even Kim Kardashian
because she hasn't had a kid yet.

2041
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,860
You need a girl who's
had a bunch of babies,

2042
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,180
so she talked to mom your giant months.

2043
00:56:16,181 --> 00:56:17,400
Just like a sinkhole.

2044
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:17,731
Yeah.

2045
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:20,220
That's the only thing you could
be happy with because otherwise,

2046
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:21,870
what are you going to do
with three foot of deck?

2047
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,830
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

2048
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,140
You're,

2049
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,580
you're going to get frustrated.

2050
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:24,810
You.

2051
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:26,070
If I have a three foot dictum,

2052
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,920
I would just walk outside with
that shit like I'm tanning would,

2053
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,950
but you would never be
able to really use it.

2054
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:33,700
You will.

2055
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,520
You don't want a three foot can
have girls to slide on top of it.

2056
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,093
You know?

2057
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:39,550
If you had a three foot dick,

2058
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,650
there would be girls that would
just want to check it out.

2059
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:43,990
Just I just want to sit on
it a little bit and trust me.

2060
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:47,960
I know a couple of girls could probably
put three foot inside of them airtight.

2061
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:48,843
They would break.

2062
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,490
They would break just like the guy
who got fucked to death by the horse.

2063
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,600
There's no way that would make it.

2064
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,150
Dana could take three foot of Dick,

2065
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,500
Dana Mostec.

2066
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,580
Kira could take three foot.

2067
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:58,750
She where she wouldn't break.

2068
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,650
She would die.

2069
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:00,041
She would die.

2070
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,260
And you'd be one of those
girls that did son of Dong.

2071
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,070
They could take it.

2072
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:03,900
What is sort of dog?

2073
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:04,441
Oh my God.

2074
00:57:04,441 --> 00:57:06,490
Son Of Dong is like the crazy,

2075
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,040
crazy giant fake dick with the giant.

2076
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:10,540
Huge geyser that.

2077
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:12,203
Yeah,

2078
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,031
I've seen that.

2079
00:57:13,031 --> 00:57:13,780
Those are so weird.

2080
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,360
Weird shaped as a penis.

2081
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:16,830
Yeah.

2082
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:16,960
Yeah.

2083
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,591
What is that?

2084
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:19,360
That's so because they looked so fake.

2085
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:19,510
Yeah.

2086
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:20,650
It is weird.

2087
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:21,311
Porn is that.

2088
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:22,780
We're a giant fake Dick.

2089
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,680
I like watching it though.

2090
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:25,810
The art design and set design is amazing.

2091
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:26,351
You know,

2092
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:26,831
it's a very,

2093
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:31,831
very creative set design with
a big stupid fake rubber Dick.

2094
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:33,350
What?

2095
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,380
What is this stuff that
you've been doing for a.

2096
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,080
for Vice magazine Dot Com.

2097
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:42,100
I do this show called fresh off the boat
and we use food to get into culture and

2098
00:57:42,101 --> 00:57:43,150
we meet all these Weirdos.

2099
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:46,300
Basically the whole point of the
show is to travel around the world,

2100
00:57:46,301 --> 00:57:49,090
traveling around the United States
and find stories and people that other

2101
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:50,290
outlets don't want to talk about.

2102
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,573
You know,

2103
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:52,483
what kind of,

2104
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,270
what kind of stores.

2105
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:53,711
For instance,

2106
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:56,070
like we went in the bank bus
with j Dot Stevens in Miami.

2107
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,490
Fritos.

2108
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:58,240
And then you know,

2109
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,340
we watched her work and
we did that whole episode.

2110
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:01,174
We went to go see him,

2111
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,720
watch her do a bang bus.

2112
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:03,820
Yeah.

2113
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,140
We watched the whole thing.

2114
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,570
So what do they do that they.

2115
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:08,760
You put her in the bus.

2116
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:09,910
It was reversed bus,

2117
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,300
right?

2118
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,650
So they put her in the back of the bus.

2119
00:58:11,651 --> 00:58:14,860
They drive around and they pick up
dudes off the street to just bang,

2120
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,670
here's the trailer.

2121
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:16,810
What's a reverse bus?

2122
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:18,070
The reverse buses.

2123
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,240
Her going in and doing that,

2124
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:23,050
the bank was normally is a dude driving
around and find chicks on the street,

2125
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:28,140
a reverse bosses her looking for and
then other shows we've done is we went to

2126
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:29,360
go.

2127
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,280
We didn't want to separate people from
the slaughter because we want people to

2128
00:58:33,281 --> 00:58:34,720
know you're eating food,

2129
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:37,240
you're eating animal protein
and animal is slaughtered.

2130
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,180
So the first episode we ever did was
showing like a white rabbit being

2131
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:40,630
slaughtered.

2132
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:41,410
I saw that one.

2133
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,010
Do you like it?

2134
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:42,843
Yes.

2135
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:47,410
We're like a pretty thoughtful food show
and we try to challenge people really

2136
00:58:47,411 --> 00:58:48,310
want to challenge them.

2137
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,110
We don't just give them candy is not just.

2138
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,000
So we really want them to think about,

2139
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:52,600
you know,

2140
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,810
the culture that,

2141
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,550
that they're engrossed in the
cultures that they're supporting and,

2142
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:57,403
and things like that.

2143
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,800
Was that the first time you
ever killed an animal like that?

2144
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:00,640
No.

2145
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,473
You know,

2146
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:01,840
I've,

2147
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,673
we've killed animals.

2148
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:04,420
I Cook Chinese food.

2149
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,800
So you're always cooking seafood,

2150
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,270
cooking live seafood.

2151
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,150
And then I've seen chicken slaughtered.

2152
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:12,850
I've never seen a cow slaughter
and never seen a pig slaughter,

2153
00:59:12,851 --> 00:59:13,631
but I've seen chickens.

2154
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:15,220
I've seen seafood and I saw a rabbit.

2155
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:16,290
Yeah,

2156
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:17,530
rabbit was pretty intense.

2157
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:18,370
Yeah,

2158
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:19,390
it was definitely intense.

2159
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:23,850
Like everybody there was pretty moving
because you watch a life leave the earth

2160
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,880
in front of you and I'm funny.

2161
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,361
Shit was.

2162
00:59:27,361 --> 00:59:30,150
I actually thought I died
like a week ago in Houston.

2163
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:31,050
It was really funny.

2164
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:33,660
I ate this into cub bubblegum Hash.

2165
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:38,010
They made this beef jerky out of Indycar
Bubblegum Hash and high times gave it

2166
00:59:38,011 --> 00:59:43,011
to me and so I'm eating it and I didn't
remember the kind of dose it ate it all.

2167
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,320
I gave like a little piece to my homie.

2168
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:50,040
I get a little piece of my brother and
I remember about 30 minutes after I'm

2169
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:53,730
watching like house of cards on
Netflix by myself and I'm like,

2170
00:59:53,731 --> 00:59:54,564
Yo,

2171
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,433
oh my God,

2172
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,610
I think I just died.

2173
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,400
And I went to my brother and
I felt like I couldn't move.

2174
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,890
I could like see shit and I couldn't hear
shit and I went to my brother and my,

2175
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:04,320
you gotta take me to the hospital.

2176
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:05,580
You've got to take me to the hospital.

2177
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:06,190
He said,

2178
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,470
what am I going to take
you to the hospital,

2179
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:08,304
motherfucker?

2180
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:08,790
And I was like,

2181
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:09,900
I think I just died.

2182
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,930
He's a die in front of me right now.

2183
01:00:12,931 --> 01:00:13,290
I'm like,

2184
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,790
so you can hear me,

2185
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:15,391
you can see me.

2186
01:00:15,391 --> 01:00:16,041
I'm like jumping on here,

2187
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:16,671
but you could see this.

2188
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:17,100
He's like,

2189
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:17,371
dude,

2190
01:00:17,371 --> 01:00:18,270
you are not dead.

2191
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,313
Go to sleep.

2192
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:20,610
I was like,

2193
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:22,080
you have to take me to the hospital.

2194
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,600
I feel like my spirit
left my physical body

2195
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,600
talking about and so he takes
me to the hospital in Houston.

2196
01:00:30,601 --> 01:00:34,200
We were there cooking for the all star
game and like Dwayne Wade and I'm in the

2197
01:00:34,201 --> 01:00:34,681
hospital.

2198
01:00:34,681 --> 01:00:36,180
We check in and doctors like what's wrong?

2199
01:00:36,181 --> 01:00:39,090
It's like I think my spirit left.

2200
01:00:39,091 --> 01:00:40,920
My physical body is like,

2201
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,700
what the fuck did you do as like eight
in the bubblegum has jerky and he's like,

2202
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,260
you need to chill the fuck out.

2203
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:49,350
You need to just chill the
fuck out because there was
nothing anyone can do for

2204
01:00:49,351 --> 01:00:49,411
you.

2205
01:00:49,411 --> 01:00:49,681
I was like,

2206
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:50,514
did I just dies?

2207
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:50,730
No,

2208
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,430
you didn't die as high as
fuck and you're being a pussy

2209
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:55,390
way described it.

2210
01:00:55,391 --> 01:00:57,920
Indigo bubblegum Hash Jerky.

2211
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,760
That's very specific to some chefs.

2212
01:01:00,761 --> 01:01:00,940
Shit.

2213
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:01,773
Yeah,

2214
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,420
yeah.

2215
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,700
We've talked about it a
billion times on the podcast,

2216
01:01:06,701 --> 01:01:09,430
but a lot of people don't know
that when you eat marijuana,

2217
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,950
it's a totally different
psychoactive experience.

2218
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,020
Your body produces something,

2219
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:19,270
goes through your liver and it produces
something called a one pass and it makes

2220
01:01:19,271 --> 01:01:23,830
this chemical called 11 hydroxy metabolite
and it's four to five times more

2221
01:01:23,831 --> 01:01:26,590
psychoactive than thc in smokable form,

2222
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:29,230
so it's not the same drug.

2223
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,450
Can You die from that shit?

2224
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:30,901
No,

2225
01:01:30,901 --> 01:01:31,131
no,

2226
01:01:31,131 --> 01:01:31,251
no,

2227
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:31,440
no,

2228
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:31,980
no,

2229
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:32,450
no,

2230
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:32,591
no.

2231
01:01:32,591 --> 01:01:35,260
The only way you're
going to die from drink,

2232
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,050
drink milk,

2233
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:36,883
right?

2234
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:37,850
Just trust me.

2235
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:41,310
If you'll calm down like within five
minutes does not scientifically about

2236
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:41,831
listening to him.

2237
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:45,430
He doesn't know what the fuck you're
going to throw up milk that's just need a

2238
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:46,151
little glass of milk.

2239
01:01:46,151 --> 01:01:47,140
Just listen.

2240
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:48,100
That's not scientific.

2241
01:01:48,101 --> 01:01:48,341
Brian.

2242
01:01:48,341 --> 01:01:53,341
You're talking nonsense because I eat
as much hash is that you're fucked.

2243
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,560
You're not going to a glass of milk.

2244
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:55,790
It's not going to make me feel fine,

2245
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:01,210
but I ate fucking oldest fucking
Hash jerky and I never felt so bad.

2246
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,440
I felt like I did heroin.

2247
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:02,711
Yeah,

2248
01:02:02,711 --> 01:02:04,300
I can get you really scary high.

2249
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:07,060
You can get to the point where
it's really uncomfortable,

2250
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:07,630
you know?

2251
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:08,770
And that's that shit.

2252
01:02:08,771 --> 01:02:13,570
It's not fun to go to a hospital and
tell people your spirit animals broken.

2253
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:14,443
No,

2254
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:15,101
no,

2255
01:02:15,101 --> 01:02:15,510
but I,

2256
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:17,620
I did think that I fucked up.

2257
01:02:17,621 --> 01:02:18,401
I went too far.

2258
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:18,561
I've,

2259
01:02:18,561 --> 01:02:18,741
I've,

2260
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:19,920
I've gotten there before.

2261
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:20,760
We'd just like.

2262
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,220
But I always liked that I liked,

2263
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:24,750
I liked what it feels like when it's over,

2264
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:28,260
you're like me and weed are fighting
because it's like I love this space for so

2265
01:02:28,261 --> 01:02:28,920
long and I'm like,

2266
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,940
you really hurt me.

2267
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,170
You really hurt me.

2268
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:32,320
This do edibles.

2269
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,460
Edibles are amazing,

2270
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,990
but it's all in the dosage.

2271
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,070
It's very tricky.

2272
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:38,941
I'd love that.

2273
01:02:38,941 --> 01:02:39,150
A bowl.

2274
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,440
So I prefer edibles

2275
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:42,880
for regular Ed.

2276
01:02:42,881 --> 01:02:43,714
A bleeder?

2277
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:44,310
Yeah.

2278
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:44,820
Yeah.

2279
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:45,653
I prefer it.

2280
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,190
I think it's better for your body.

2281
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,440
I think it's better for
your body and I think the,

2282
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,240
the intensity of the experience,

2283
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:54,600
it lasts longer and to me
it's more introspective.

2284
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:55,440
I learn more.

2285
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:55,951
Oh,

2286
01:02:55,951 --> 01:02:58,470
you definitely think of wild shit.

2287
01:02:58,471 --> 01:02:59,130
I was like,

2288
01:02:59,130 --> 01:02:59,880
I was saying,

2289
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,910
I felt like I was one of those Christian
inspirational people because I'm in the

2290
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,080
car.

2291
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,200
Like,

2292
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:03,780
Evan,

2293
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,110
you have to realize that every day you
have to fight to stay alive because as

2294
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:08,610
soon as you stop you will die.

2295
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:09,331
I just thought,

2296
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:09,901
I swear to God,

2297
01:03:09,901 --> 01:03:11,070
I just started watching house of cards.

2298
01:03:11,071 --> 01:03:11,430
He's like,

2299
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:12,031
you did not die.

2300
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:13,140
Shut the fuck up.

2301
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,130
Just don't watch anymore.

2302
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,330
Kevin Spacey Movies.

2303
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,040
Did you ever see the,

2304
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:17,370
um,

2305
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:18,041
the nine one,

2306
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:21,300
one call where the cops stole
some pot from some kids,

2307
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,260
made some pot brownies and then
the cops called nine slash 11

2308
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:28,440
and that's the thing.

2309
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,280
They thought they died.

2310
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,290
They thought that the time it stopped

2311
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,190
calling in nine slash 11,

2312
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:38,220
just shitting their pants
thinking that this is the end.

2313
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:38,560
No,

2314
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,710
I thought I heard like the universe,

2315
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:41,544
his voice was like,

2316
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:42,090
Eddie,

2317
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,110
you've checked out.

2318
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:43,650
Like,

2319
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:44,850
I really thought I died.

2320
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:45,040
I was,

2321
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:45,873
ah,

2322
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:46,810
the game is over,

2323
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:47,923
it's over.

2324
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:48,781
I heard the theme.

2325
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:50,250
Music to game is over.

2326
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:51,990
You can definitely too much pot,

2327
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,250
but then after it's over,

2328
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:54,084
you feel fine.

2329
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,830
It's not even like getting drunk,

2330
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:56,400
you know,

2331
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,410
that feeling that you get
after you have a hangover.

2332
01:03:58,411 --> 01:03:59,400
It's like God damn it.

2333
01:03:59,401 --> 01:04:01,140
I don't want to ever
Joel that I ate so much.

2334
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,460
My head hurt for three days.

2335
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:03,120
Whoa.

2336
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:03,840
I could not.

2337
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,350
I did not.

2338
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:05,760
It took me a while to come back.

2339
01:04:05,761 --> 01:04:06,960
Three days.

2340
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,540
You probably broke
something just with anxiety.

2341
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,300
Just the anxiety alone was
probably so much stress.

2342
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:12,750
Oh yeah.

2343
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,111
They're like,

2344
01:04:13,111 --> 01:04:14,090
your brain was like

2345
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:17,610
the muscle in my brain.

2346
01:04:17,611 --> 01:04:18,444
Fucking hurt.

2347
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,530
So yeah,

2348
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:22,230
kids don't eat that
fucking bubblegum Hash.

2349
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:23,910
I find that edibles,

2350
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:28,370
make food tastes the best too because I
think smoking anything probably Dolan's

2351
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,050
your palate a little bit
and you have like um,

2352
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:37,000
options out here without a
bolts that are fairly delicious.

2353
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:37,590
But,

2354
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:42,330
but also you can actually like pretty
much rely on the dose with someone like

2355
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:43,164
candies.

2356
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:43,761
Like,

2357
01:04:43,761 --> 01:04:44,050
you know,

2358
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,920
like you'll like Ari Shaffir.

2359
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,531
I'll ask him like,

2360
01:04:46,531 --> 01:04:46,891
what is this?

2361
01:04:46,891 --> 01:04:47,431
Candy goes,

2362
01:04:47,431 --> 01:04:48,750
it's like a half a breath strip.

2363
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:49,380
Like,

2364
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,100
okay,

2365
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:50,550
got it.

2366
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:51,383
But not always.

2367
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:51,720
No,

2368
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,590
not always.

2369
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:53,880
It's still not accurate.

2370
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:54,540
You're right.

2371
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,540
But some companies like you
get used to a company you know,

2372
01:04:57,541 --> 01:05:01,030
and they got their shit together and
they can make it until the feds come and

2373
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:03,120
buster door down and
fucking take him away.

2374
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:03,961
Problem with edibles.

2375
01:05:03,961 --> 01:05:06,270
It's also how much you have
in your stomach already.

2376
01:05:06,271 --> 01:05:08,790
So that's a factor where
you know when you smoke it,

2377
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:09,870
you don't have to deal with that.

2378
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:12,180
That's where breast strips come in
because it doesn't matter because it just

2379
01:05:12,181 --> 01:05:13,230
goes into your bloodstream.

2380
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,033
Crazy

2381
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,020
sophisticated out here on

2382
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,000
the west coast,

2383
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:20,120
kid it.

2384
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:22,090
How hard is it getting
good weed in New York?

2385
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:22,931
Yo,

2386
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:24,220
I got a really good service.

2387
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:24,970
I have served that.

2388
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:27,820
They come through and they always have
seven to eight strands every time.

2389
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:29,770
But before I met these dudes,

2390
01:05:29,771 --> 01:05:30,760
life was miserable.

2391
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:32,700
It was just like sour or haze or,

2392
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:33,041
or,

2393
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:33,490
or,

2394
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:34,120
or Kush.

2395
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,900
It's just hard to find someone that you
actually want to know your phone number

2396
01:05:37,901 --> 01:05:40,060
that's selling weed and
these dudes are adults.

2397
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:41,170
They don't show what you,

2398
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:44,140
they don't fucking try to like hang out
and get to know your life in and out.

2399
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,200
Like give me the best weed and I'll see
you later and I'll call you next time.

2400
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:48,220
So that's what you need.

2401
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:53,080
But it does not touch California
like California is on some shit.

2402
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:53,630
It's crazy.

2403
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:54,463
That's the best.

2404
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,340
I got a GPA.

2405
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:57,880
Those do.

2406
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,660
I'll hook you up.

2407
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,710
Those dudes are awesome.

2408
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:00,220
Cool.

2409
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:00,940
Yeah.

2410
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:04,030
The G pen is the best way to smoke
because the wax tastes so good.

2411
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,480
It's like minty fresh chocolate
mint ice cream has g and g pen?

2412
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,080
A new type of vaporizer or something?

2413
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,730
There's a few of them
are going to get you one.

2414
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:13,960
So many of them out.

2415
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:15,160
But have you had an idea lab?

2416
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:16,700
I DAB is the way to go in,

2417
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:20,950
in your home like on the road pen the
best but I dabs are fucking crazy.

2418
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:21,671
How do you spell it?

2419
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:22,504
G just.

2420
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:23,693
Yeah,

2421
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:24,671
grateful science.

2422
01:06:24,671 --> 01:06:25,504
My boy Chris,

2423
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:26,321
he lives in La.

2424
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:27,041
I'll hook you guys up.

2425
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:27,620
He's the best.

2426
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:27,851
I've.

2427
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:28,930
I've used a lot of them.

2428
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:30,730
Like the plume bypass is not bad,

2429
01:06:30,731 --> 01:06:32,190
but the g pen,

2430
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,480
it's definitely my favorite so far.

2431
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:37,280
That's the one I use on the show all
the time when we shoot on the west coat

2432
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,950
shoot whenever we used the g pen.

2433
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:39,220
Yeah,

2434
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:40,060
I want one so bad.

2435
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:40,630
Yeah.

2436
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:41,650
They taste amazing.

2437
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:46,910
The scientists out here that
are concocting different
ways to take your weed to

2438
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,580
doing pretty amazing ways.

2439
01:06:48,581 --> 01:06:49,630
They have hunting now.

2440
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:50,360
Yeah.

2441
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:55,360
Well we can spend talk some talk lately
about what is the legality of Hash and

2442
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:57,910
all these oils and stuff like that.

2443
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,040
So they have this g pen vaporizer.

2444
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,150
They sell it online.

2445
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:06,300
Anybody can buy it online because you
could any tobacco with it right now.

2446
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:07,600
When you buy this,

2447
01:07:07,601 --> 01:07:08,740
what do you do with your stick?

2448
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:11,920
We'd in wax and that you put
the essential oil in there.

2449
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:12,460
Yeah.

2450
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,950
And then you just have to
get that from a dispensary.

2451
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:15,370
Yeah.

2452
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:16,181
But you live in La.

2453
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:17,014
It's no problem.

2454
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:17,461
But what?

2455
01:07:17,461 --> 01:07:18,294
How do you get it?

2456
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,700
Oh yeah.

2457
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,670
I know a guy who knows a guy.

2458
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,290
He uses it for tobacco.

2459
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:27,580
Do you have a hard time when you're on
the road getting good weed when you're

2460
01:07:27,581 --> 01:07:28,340
doing your show?

2461
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:28,610
No.

2462
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:29,260
You know,

2463
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,760
fans like people will just bring it right.

2464
01:07:31,761 --> 01:07:31,950
You know,

2465
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:32,260
they'll,

2466
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,510
they'll know and they'll just bring it.

2467
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,420
Like when I do book tours,

2468
01:07:34,421 --> 01:07:37,410
there's always two or three people at
every book event that brings me weird.

2469
01:07:37,411 --> 01:07:38,590
And how many of them are cops?

2470
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,780
Most of them are Asian children.

2471
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,673
Easily.

2472
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:44,830
Just like Asian kids,

2473
01:07:44,831 --> 01:07:45,664
you know,

2474
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,390
they grew up like me.

2475
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:46,550
Like,

2476
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:46,720
Yo,

2477
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,560
I know how you are.

2478
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:48,394
You need this shit.

2479
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:50,620
Those are the best people.

2480
01:07:50,621 --> 01:07:52,360
They bring me weed everywhere I go.

2481
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:53,010
That's fun.

2482
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:54,940
That's the best thing about
being a public public.

2483
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,040
Publicly known president smokes weed.

2484
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:58,060
People will hook you up.

2485
01:07:58,350 --> 01:07:58,900
Yeah,

2486
01:07:58,900 --> 01:07:59,440
I agree.

2487
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,450
Do you smoke pot with
people that you meet?

2488
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,300
People who know you from the show?

2489
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:04,511
Yeah,

2490
01:08:04,511 --> 01:08:07,300
I'll smoke where anyone because I'm not
a dude that smokes weed and they can't

2491
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:07,691
function.

2492
01:08:07,691 --> 01:08:08,524
I'm a functional.

2493
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:10,960
We do function right,

2494
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:11,781
but do you trust there?

2495
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:12,251
We're like,

2496
01:08:12,251 --> 01:08:14,470
what if someone wants a lace you up?

2497
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:15,350
It's no.

2498
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:17,840
Have you been late like me?

2499
01:08:17,841 --> 01:08:18,320
No,

2500
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,160
but I know a person.

2501
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:19,880
Yes.

2502
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,540
One Dude.

2503
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:20,840
Yeah.

2504
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,430
No one do see ICP.

2505
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:23,930
Somebody put the PCP in this weed.

2506
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:25,640
Well Damn.

2507
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:26,021
Yeah,

2508
01:08:26,021 --> 01:08:26,870
that's hardcore.

2509
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,330
I've had a very bad situation I had.

2510
01:08:29,331 --> 01:08:31,310
It wasn't like a fan or anything,

2511
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:35,300
but I had somebody give me weed once that
was dipped in embalming fluid in that

2512
01:08:35,301 --> 01:08:37,510
really ruined my own Bama.

2513
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:37,671
Yeah,

2514
01:08:37,671 --> 01:08:40,190
that's what I feel like.

2515
01:08:40,191 --> 01:08:42,320
I feel like weed is
such a friendly culture.

2516
01:08:42,321 --> 01:08:43,760
Like why would you do that to somebody?

2517
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,070
Because people are broken.

2518
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:46,780
I mean even the weeds
are friendly culture.

2519
01:08:46,781 --> 01:08:49,540
There's certain amount of any
culture that's going to be broken.

2520
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:49,881
Yeah.

2521
01:08:49,881 --> 01:08:51,990
There's people that are
just unavoidably fucked up.

2522
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,220
So you won't smoke weed
people give you one tour?

2523
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:54,820
Yeah.

2524
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:55,450
Not Anymore.

2525
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:56,200
Not after that.

2526
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:56,860
Oh Wow.

2527
01:08:56,860 --> 01:09:01,630
When I found out that there was a guy I
told the story before but by a cop that

2528
01:09:01,631 --> 01:09:05,050
was asking me for Dmt in
Cleveland and I knew it was a cop,

2529
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:05,891
I just.

2530
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:09,190
It was the most obvious cop ever because
some guy after a show by himself with a

2531
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:10,970
crew cut asked me for details like,

2532
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:11,291
bitch,

2533
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:12,490
what are you talking about?

2534
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,860
You really coming and
asking me for illegal drug.

2535
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:15,930
Yeah.

2536
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,730
The specific ask to.

2537
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:20,140
It's a very specific
flavor that you're asking.

2538
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,033
Yeah,

2539
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:23,410
it's very specific when the problem is,

2540
01:09:23,411 --> 01:09:24,810
if every place was like California,

2541
01:09:24,811 --> 01:09:24,911
yeah,

2542
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:25,744
it's smoking anybody,

2543
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,340
but every place is not like California
and there are places where it's super

2544
01:09:30,341 --> 01:09:30,940
illegal.

2545
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:33,100
Like you get caught in Texas,

2546
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:33,391
you know,

2547
01:09:33,391 --> 01:09:35,320
like Willie Nelson got arrested in Texas.

2548
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:38,230
I mean if you arrest
Willie Nelson for pot,

2549
01:09:38,231 --> 01:09:39,510
you're a fucking communist,

2550
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:39,790
you know,

2551
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:40,030
and you,

2552
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:40,661
you really,

2553
01:09:40,661 --> 01:09:40,961
you,

2554
01:09:40,961 --> 01:09:41,210
you,

2555
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:41,560
you,

2556
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:41,920
you,

2557
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,670
you're a fucking,

2558
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:43,503
you're the enemy.

2559
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:44,250
God dammit.

2560
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,640
I mean it's pretty decriminalized
in America I think in,

2561
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:47,820
in the next five to 10.

2562
01:09:47,821 --> 01:09:49,740
Like weed is going to be
like California everywhere.

2563
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:50,940
There's still so many people in

2564
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:51,670
jail though.

2565
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:53,660
There's so many people
in jail because of it.

2566
01:09:53,661 --> 01:09:54,520
And did they.

2567
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:55,690
What did they do with their grandfather?

2568
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,190
Those guys in and let everybody out.

2569
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:58,103
I don't know.

2570
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,520
I don't think they're gonna they should,

2571
01:09:59,521 --> 01:10:00,510
but I don't think they will.

2572
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:04,260
The the laws in a lot
of places like Phoenix,

2573
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:05,160
it's real bad.

2574
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:05,911
It's not.

2575
01:10:05,911 --> 01:10:07,060
It's not good in taxes.

2576
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:09,330
That's scaring a lot of places.

2577
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,910
How many different cities
have you gone to do your show?

2578
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,710
We've done la,

2579
01:10:13,711 --> 01:10:14,521
San Fran,

2580
01:10:14,521 --> 01:10:15,330
Miami,

2581
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:16,080
New York,

2582
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,070
Taiwan?

2583
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:17,730
Yeah,

2584
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:18,480
five.

2585
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,070
So I was Taiwan.

2586
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,480
Taiwan was amazing.

2587
01:10:21,481 --> 01:10:21,841
Man.

2588
01:10:21,841 --> 01:10:23,610
Taiwan is the best time.

2589
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:24,453
One is the best.

2590
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:26,560
What do you speak like?

2591
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:28,160
Yeah,

2592
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:28,861
I speak Mandarin.

2593
01:10:28,861 --> 01:10:29,580
Chinese.

2594
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,560
Now if you're around Cantonese people,

2595
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:32,310
what happens?

2596
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:33,750
I can't understand what they're saying.

2597
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:36,180
It sounds like they're playing
Chinese through guitar.

2598
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:38,430
No,

2599
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:39,780
I got mad cantonese homies,

2600
01:10:39,781 --> 01:10:40,081
but no,

2601
01:10:40,081 --> 01:10:42,750
I don't understand Cantonese and
they barely understand mandarin.

2602
01:10:42,751 --> 01:10:43,290
It's tough.

2603
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:44,030
Wow.

2604
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:44,510
Yeah.

2605
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:46,830
It's not just north and
south like you got an accent.

2606
01:10:46,831 --> 01:10:48,780
It's like really some extra tone.

2607
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:49,890
This read it.

2608
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:51,870
I can read some things.

2609
01:10:51,871 --> 01:10:55,500
I know a few words I probably read on
like a kindergarten level and I speak on

2610
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,191
like a fifth grade,

2611
01:10:56,191 --> 01:10:57,024
sixth grade level,

2612
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:58,290
but you speak in a fifth grade,

2613
01:10:58,291 --> 01:10:58,981
sixth grade level.

2614
01:10:58,981 --> 01:11:03,810
Just because you know some of it
not because it's across the board.

2615
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:04,910
Oh No.

2616
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,521
Cantonese?

2617
01:11:05,521 --> 01:11:05,641
No.

2618
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:07,020
I don't know shit about Cantonese,

2619
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:08,280
but the written is the same.

2620
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,890
Or written language is the same.

2621
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:12,810
He's written the written
Cantonese is the same.

2622
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:13,290
Yeah.

2623
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:13,501
Oh,

2624
01:11:13,501 --> 01:11:14,101
fascinating.

2625
01:11:14,101 --> 01:11:14,910
Yeah.

2626
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:15,301
So,

2627
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:16,980
but the way they say it is different.

2628
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:18,000
Cantonese and Mandarin.

2629
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:19,710
So you can read all Cantonese.

2630
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,550
No problem.

2631
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:21,900
I think it's the same characters.

2632
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:23,080
I'm pretty sure it's the same case.

2633
01:11:23,081 --> 01:11:24,090
So how the fuck is it?

2634
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,410
A different language?

2635
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:26,490
It's another tone.

2636
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,110
They have another tone when they speak it.

2637
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:29,371
Oh my God.

2638
01:11:29,371 --> 01:11:29,960
That's weird.

2639
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:30,930
That's insanity.

2640
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:31,440
Yeah.

2641
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,370
What does it sound like?

2642
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,360
Like what's the difference?

2643
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,230
Can you tell me the difference?

2644
01:11:34,231 --> 01:11:34,890
Can you like,

2645
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:35,940
give me like a sentence?

2646
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:37,860
The lomea like they say stuff.

2647
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,940
It's bouncier.

2648
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,070
It sounds bouncier without like,

2649
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,870
without being racist and making fun of it.

2650
01:11:42,871 --> 01:11:43,051
You know,

2651
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:45,650
it just sounds to me like
you're allowed to make fun.

2652
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:46,470
You're Chinese.

2653
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:47,400
You can let it slide,

2654
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:49,100
but like a no.

2655
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:49,943
It's like,

2656
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,300
I'm not even saying words,

2657
01:11:51,301 --> 01:11:53,340
but I'm just imitating the sound like a,

2658
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:54,523
you know,

2659
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:55,890
a thing don't die.

2660
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:58,410
They're like super bouncy that way,

2661
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,170
but it's different than
managing in what way?

2662
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,480
What's confused me is fifth tone.

2663
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,130
Oh yeah.

2664
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:06,990
But the characters are the same,

2665
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,740
but they have a different
sound for the characters.

2666
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,633
Is that what it is?

2667
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,050
Which is kinda crazy.

2668
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:14,003
Wow.

2669
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:15,330
So I'm like,

2670
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,670
you like one person would say shoe,

2671
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:20,430
they would have a totally
different noise for it,

2672
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:22,080
but if you wrote it down,

2673
01:12:22,081 --> 01:12:22,970
you both saw shoe.

2674
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:23,580
Yeah.

2675
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:24,330
Whoa.

2676
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:25,200
You're blowing my mind.

2677
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,083
Whoa.

2678
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,910
How many people are on it
will check this and make sure.

2679
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:31,890
I mean we can check this and make sure,

2680
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:33,540
but I'm almost positive that it is.

2681
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,460
I'm pretty positive it
is the same language.

2682
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,430
How many people were on each like,

2683
01:12:38,431 --> 01:12:40,450
I mean there's a million commandment.

2684
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:40,770
Much,

2685
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:42,570
much more speaking mandarin and Cantonese.

2686
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:46,560
How much more Cantonese is just like
the southeast of China and Hong Kong.

2687
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:47,623
Wow.

2688
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:49,170
How the fuck does that ever happen?

2689
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,073
You know,

2690
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:54,810
they just lost the war
because some Mongo type shit.

2691
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:57,913
Wow,

2692
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:58,760
that's good.

2693
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:02,760
So the whole idea of a billion people
on a continent is a fucking trip,

2694
01:13:02,761 --> 01:13:03,370
man.

2695
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:04,200
Yeah.

2696
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,320
And did it.

2697
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:06,500
Did.

2698
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:10,410
It wasn't even a billion people on the
whole planet just a little while ago.

2699
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:11,491
Yeah,

2700
01:13:11,491 --> 01:13:11,791
man,

2701
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:15,060
we are way too good at making babies and
that's why they're trying to limit it.

2702
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,031
Yeah.

2703
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:19,270
My Friend Duncan actually have funny
thing that he said yesterday that some

2704
01:13:19,271 --> 01:13:24,271
people believe that this is such
an amazing time to be alive,

2705
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,540
that so many souls are trying
to reincarnate to this time.

2706
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:30,130
That's why there's so
many people on the planet.

2707
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:31,210
Yeah.

2708
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:31,481
Okay.

2709
01:13:31,481 --> 01:13:32,410
So they say here,

2710
01:13:32,411 --> 01:13:36,130
written Cantonese is the most highly
developed written form of all Chinese

2711
01:13:36,131 --> 01:13:40,630
varieties apart from standard mandarin
and classical standard written Chinese is

2712
01:13:40,631 --> 01:13:41,320
based on manner,

2713
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,300
but when spoken word
for word as Cantonese,

2714
01:13:43,301 --> 01:13:48,250
it sounds unnatural
because it's expressions or
ungrammatical in an idiomatic in

2715
01:13:48,251 --> 01:13:49,084
Cantonese.

2716
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:52,440
So Cantonese speakers have
developed their own written scripts,

2717
01:13:52,441 --> 01:13:55,900
sometimes creating new characters for
words that either do not exist or have

2718
01:13:55,901 --> 01:13:57,190
been lost in standard Chinese.

2719
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,500
But basically it's based
on the same language.

2720
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:00,460
Wow.

2721
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:01,780
It's just more refined.

2722
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:02,280
That'd be weird.

2723
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:07,280
Trying to speak English and just speak
it differently with using the same words.

2724
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:09,013
Yeah.

2725
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:10,763
Yeah.

2726
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:13,260
What the fuck man.

2727
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:15,310
So uh,

2728
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:17,600
what is it like working with the
vice guys were fucking love it.

2729
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:19,920
I love vice man best.

2730
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:24,970
I've worked with so many people and vice
just let you do your thing and that's

2731
01:14:24,971 --> 01:14:25,804
the best part.

2732
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:26,321
And like I,

2733
01:14:26,321 --> 01:14:27,430
I just went through a whole week.

2734
01:14:27,431 --> 01:14:28,091
I was at Ted,

2735
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:31,750
I'm a ted fellow this year and I went
through a whole week of people telling me

2736
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:32,291
what to do,

2737
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:35,860
where to be and it was like being at
a fucking scientology summer camp.

2738
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:36,694
It was horrible.

2739
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,230
Tell me what the fuck happened.

2740
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,730
They told you that you,

2741
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:40,011
you,

2742
01:14:40,011 --> 01:14:41,730
you can't leave yet.

2743
01:14:41,731 --> 01:14:42,630
Like before you go there,

2744
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,290
you need to participate in Ted,

2745
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:44,750
you need to be.

2746
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:45,550
I'm like alright cool.

2747
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:46,060
I'm,

2748
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:48,640
I figure like mines are reasonable.

2749
01:14:48,641 --> 01:14:51,550
If you have to do something in
La you can go do something in La.

2750
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:54,730
I gave them like four
or five days of my time,

2751
01:14:54,731 --> 01:14:56,240
like I was there every single day.

2752
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:56,921
Thirteen hours.

2753
01:14:56,921 --> 01:15:00,550
Like everyday they have 13
hours of fucking activities
they have mapped out for

2754
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:01,450
you some days,

2755
01:15:01,451 --> 01:15:02,021
like 15,

2756
01:15:02,021 --> 01:15:02,920
16 hours,

2757
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:03,520
right.

2758
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,150
If you go to their after events and I was
like that's way too much fucking human

2759
01:15:07,151 --> 01:15:08,280
interaction days.

2760
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:08,920
Yeah.

2761
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,760
Explain this.

2762
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,930
So you go there and you're going
to go and do your own Ted speech,

2763
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:14,201
right?

2764
01:15:14,201 --> 01:15:14,560
Yeah.

2765
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,090
So you do your own Ted speech.

2766
01:15:16,091 --> 01:15:17,770
What does the other
stuff they have for you?

2767
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:21,000
They want you to be available
for like networking,

2768
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:24,180
cocktail events like
attendees want to talk to you,

2769
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,500
you need to be available.

2770
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:26,011
And I was like,

2771
01:15:26,011 --> 01:15:26,400
look,

2772
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:26,740
I,

2773
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:27,600
I've done a lot.

2774
01:15:27,601 --> 01:15:28,890
Like I put people on,

2775
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:31,530
like I put them in touch
with ad agency people.

2776
01:15:31,531 --> 01:15:34,380
I put them in touch with other people
to do business with other artists.

2777
01:15:34,381 --> 01:15:37,050
I introducing everyone
and I thought I was good.

2778
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:40,560
So I went yesterday to go do
DVD asa and when met up Cho,

2779
01:15:40,561 --> 01:15:45,390
I met an asa and I went and now they call
me today on the way over here and they

2780
01:15:45,391 --> 01:15:45,631
were like,

2781
01:15:45,631 --> 01:15:47,670
we're taking your fed Ted
Fellowship where I was like,

2782
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,290
why are you taking the Ted Fellowship?

2783
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,180
Like because you went to la.

2784
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:51,960
I was like,

2785
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:52,980
Urine Long Beach.

2786
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,430
I just went to La for the afternoon
to do the fucking podcast.

2787
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,480
You're fucking crazy.

2788
01:15:57,690 --> 01:15:58,320
And they're like,

2789
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,770
you took this spot from somebody who
would have gone to every talk and been in

2790
01:16:01,771 --> 01:16:02,101
everything.

2791
01:16:02,101 --> 01:16:02,341
I was like,

2792
01:16:02,341 --> 01:16:02,491
Yo,

2793
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,290
the other people weren't
there for everything,

2794
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:05,850
but you're also just crazy.

2795
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,220
Like you're fucking crazy.

2796
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:07,890
Crazy.

2797
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:08,611
They're not paying,

2798
01:16:08,611 --> 01:16:09,301
you know,

2799
01:16:09,301 --> 01:16:12,750
they don't pay that since that's going
to do it for the love and they want you

2800
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:13,920
for seven days,

2801
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:18,300
12 to 15 hours a day and you can't
just leave to go do something.

2802
01:16:18,301 --> 01:16:19,560
Some work that you have to do.

2803
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,700
It's fucked up.

2804
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:20,900
Yeah.

2805
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,200
What,

2806
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,470
what is it where people
fuck up everything.

2807
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,720
Even something as amazing as Ted,

2808
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:27,740
because Ted,

2809
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:32,270
I remember the first Ted talk that I ever
saw on the Internet a couple of years

2810
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:32,420
ago.

2811
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:35,630
We have a whole ted thread of
my message board about great.

2812
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:37,400
A great ted episodes,

2813
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:39,170
like the one how to be happy is great.

2814
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:39,501
Oh,

2815
01:16:39,501 --> 01:16:40,790
there's so many of them are.

2816
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:45,930
Graham Hancock just gave one of the war
and consciousness about Iowasca and in

2817
01:16:46,371 --> 01:16:49,640
his own problems with kicking cannabis.

2818
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:54,530
He had like a crazy weed habit where
he's high all day every day for like

2819
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:54,710
decades.

2820
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,231
And then he liked.

2821
01:16:55,231 --> 01:16:55,461
He was,

2822
01:16:55,461 --> 01:16:56,360
it was a crutch forum.

2823
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:57,380
It was like a real problem.

2824
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:58,250
Um,

2825
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,540
great ted talk about it though.

2826
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:00,680
There's so much good stuff,

2827
01:17:00,681 --> 01:17:02,750
but then you hear shit
like this and you're like,

2828
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:04,580
even they suck.

2829
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:07,430
Like even someone finds a way to fuck up.

2830
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,130
Even something as amazing as tad.

2831
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,070
The speakers

2832
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,580
are great.

2833
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:11,090
I quit.

2834
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:12,590
I can't say damn bad thing.

2835
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,080
Every single one of the
fellows is like inspirational,

2836
01:17:15,081 --> 01:17:15,501
amazing,

2837
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:16,334
doing great work.

2838
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,790
The thing is that something gets so
good and people feel the power that they

2839
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:23,270
have and then they impose rules and
that's how society got created in the

2840
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:23,990
beginning.

2841
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:27,800
Somebody got so liked and got so much
power that they could force you to do

2842
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:29,930
things that were entirely
unnatural and inhuman.

2843
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:34,700
That's so ridiculous to think that a
guy like you who's as busy as you could

2844
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:39,790
give up that much time and be angry if
you vary from their schedule at all.

2845
01:17:41,211 --> 01:17:42,330
That that sounds like more.

2846
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:43,990
I think Ted's a racist

2847
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:48,920
culturally kind of crazy too because other
people missed and they kind of picked

2848
01:17:48,921 --> 01:17:49,451
on me for it,

2849
01:17:49,451 --> 01:17:51,080
but even before I got out and I was like,

2850
01:17:51,081 --> 01:17:51,231
Yo,

2851
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,370
my birthday is Friday.

2852
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:53,780
You want me to stay till Saturday?

2853
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:57,600
Can I at least have my girls stay
with me and I'll just use the room.

2854
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:57,950
Like,

2855
01:17:57,950 --> 01:18:00,240
oh we can't because you
have a roommate at Ted,

2856
01:18:00,241 --> 01:18:01,011
so you're like 30,

2857
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:03,470
40 year old people
staying with a roommate.

2858
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:04,160
I was like,

2859
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:04,993
wait a minute.

2860
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:07,000
They make you room with people.

2861
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:07,580
Wait a minute.

2862
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:07,910
Why?

2863
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:08,780
How can they do that?

2864
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:10,400
Tell you who to sleep with.

2865
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:10,621
Yeah,

2866
01:18:10,621 --> 01:18:10,971
they were.

2867
01:18:10,971 --> 01:18:11,630
Yes,

2868
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:12,463
and they were like,

2869
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,360
you have to room.

2870
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,110
It's part of the Ted
experience and I was like,

2871
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:18,470
this is a ct at this point you have
crossed the thrust of are now fucking

2872
01:18:18,471 --> 01:18:19,310
scientology.

2873
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:20,163
Yes.

2874
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:21,103
That's crazy.

2875
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:22,910
So they assign you.

2876
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:23,271
They say,

2877
01:18:23,271 --> 01:18:24,104
you know what?

2878
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:29,410
We think that Eddie would grow if
he lived with Sasha for a week.

2879
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:29,881
Yeah.

2880
01:18:29,881 --> 01:18:31,010
So some crazy fuck.

2881
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,230
Who's Sasha Shogun?

2882
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:37,010
Who's in there cooking up crystal meth
and whatever the fuck he is doing.

2883
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:37,540
He,

2884
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,600
you'd have to stay with that guy.

2885
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:42,230
I mean luckily with this
dude software who is amazing.

2886
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:43,123
Cool cat.

2887
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:44,920
Yeah,

2888
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:49,100
you were really to be able to pull
the name of the dude is amazing.

2889
01:18:49,101 --> 01:18:50,750
His name was southwest
and I stayed with him,

2890
01:18:50,751 --> 01:18:51,380
but I was like,

2891
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:52,011
I'm 30.

2892
01:18:52,011 --> 01:18:54,350
I haven't stayed in a hotel
with people in a minute.

2893
01:18:54,351 --> 01:18:54,880
You know?

2894
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,000
How big is the hotel?

2895
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:57,350
It's a small shitty hotel.

2896
01:18:57,351 --> 01:18:58,220
It's the height reasons.

2897
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:00,000
It looks like a fucking
airport hotel in la,

2898
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:02,090
in the bed next to this guy.

2899
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:03,590
So you have to hear each other's snore.

2900
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:04,933
Oh Dude,

2901
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:07,040
what the fuck is that?

2902
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:10,760
And they also hold this shit at long beach
and it's like next to like across the

2903
01:19:10,761 --> 01:19:10,971
street,

2904
01:19:10,971 --> 01:19:12,810
literally you have back to back out,

2905
01:19:12,811 --> 01:19:15,800
back pf Chang's and like subway.

2906
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,001
It's ridiculous.

2907
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:18,920
But the whole thing is just weird.

2908
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:19,340
I was like,

2909
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,360
I'll pay for my own room.

2910
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:20,780
They're like,

2911
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:20,961
no,

2912
01:19:20,961 --> 01:19:21,794
you're not allowed.

2913
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:22,520
I was like,

2914
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,070
you're not allowed to
pay for your own room.

2915
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:25,610
Yeah,

2916
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:26,510
they're crazy.

2917
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:27,800
They just want to control you.

2918
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:29,030
That is amazing.

2919
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:30,140
So I still love the talks.

2920
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:31,160
I love all the speakers,

2921
01:19:31,161 --> 01:19:33,140
but the organization is fucked.

2922
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:36,560
That's hilarious that they think that
they can have that kind of influence over

2923
01:19:36,561 --> 01:19:36,970
you.

2924
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:40,040
It's part of the Ted experience
as part of the Ted experience.

2925
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:41,670
It's part of the Ted experience.

2926
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:46,250
No one's talked about this before
because this seems like straight up boy

2927
01:19:46,251 --> 01:19:46,761
scouts.

2928
01:19:46,761 --> 01:19:47,120
Yeah.

2929
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,700
You know what is the thing
is most people they need 10.

2930
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:51,200
They need to put you on.

2931
01:19:51,201 --> 01:19:54,230
They want the coastline and most people
it's like if you do something for me,

2932
01:19:54,231 --> 01:19:55,310
I won't say anything about you,

2933
01:19:55,311 --> 01:19:56,150
but that's.

2934
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:56,421
I mean,

2935
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:56,931
I think Joe,

2936
01:19:56,931 --> 01:19:57,764
you're the same way.

2937
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,240
I don't give a fuck what you do for me.

2938
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:03,980
If you're a fucking Weirdo and you're
about to start some new coat conference,

2939
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:04,490
religion,

2940
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:05,330
I'm going to say something.

2941
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:06,920
I'm not going to follow your rules.

2942
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:09,810
I would write a book about this by trade.

2943
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:13,320
They actually tried to get me to do
what they wanted me to do for four,

2944
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:14,160
five,

2945
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:14,461
six,

2946
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:14,941
seven days,

2947
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:15,750
whatever it was,

2948
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:16,830
and not paying you.

2949
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:18,570
They send packets to to be like,

2950
01:20:18,571 --> 01:20:20,340
this is how to network with billionaires.

2951
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:23,940
Like how to go to work with billionaires,

2952
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:28,050
how to go to a network and talk to people
and talk to potential people who could

2953
01:20:28,051 --> 01:20:29,130
collaborate and work with you.

2954
01:20:29,131 --> 01:20:29,640
They're like,

2955
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,380
don't just go ask them for money.

2956
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:31,890
And I'm like,

2957
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:32,820
this is crazy.

2958
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:33,631
Oh my God,

2959
01:20:33,631 --> 01:20:38,631
I'm so go ask them for money and it's in
the packets and you're a grown ass man

2960
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:41,700
and they pick you like you're obviously
intelligent if you're getting picked for

2961
01:20:41,701 --> 01:20:42,780
10 and they're like,

2962
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,250
today when it rains,

2963
01:20:44,251 --> 01:20:45,210
you should pack a punch.

2964
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,020
It's wild.

2965
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:46,201
See?

2966
01:20:46,201 --> 01:20:46,620
That would.

2967
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:47,620
That is hard.

2968
01:20:47,621 --> 01:20:47,880
Okay.

2969
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:52,620
What that is is exactly the opposite of
the vehicle that got them there and the

2970
01:20:52,621 --> 01:20:54,930
vehicle that got them
there is the Internet.

2971
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:55,331
What?

2972
01:20:55,331 --> 01:20:58,650
What got them there is the fact that the
freedom of the Internet allows people

2973
01:20:58,651 --> 01:21:01,140
to exchange interesting
conversations like that,

2974
01:21:01,141 --> 01:21:01,321
hey,

2975
01:21:01,321 --> 01:21:01,700
you gotta,

2976
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:02,251
listen to this.

2977
01:21:02,251 --> 01:21:02,891
You gotta wash us.

2978
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,560
This lady gave the speech on monkeys.

2979
01:21:04,561 --> 01:21:05,251
It was amazing.

2980
01:21:05,251 --> 01:21:06,084
Whatever.

2981
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:10,490
And what they did is the exact opposite
of that and that's why even though Obama

2982
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:11,730
is focusing on gun control,

2983
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,060
the most important debate that Americans
will face in the next five years is

2984
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:15,953
internet freedom.

2985
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:19,140
Internet freedom is the most
important debate we will face.

2986
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:23,340
And we hurt so fucking blind to it because
the lobbyists are doing it under like

2987
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:24,413
under our noses.

2988
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:24,581
Yeah,

2989
01:21:24,581 --> 01:21:24,850
you,

2990
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:29,850
you surely should have the right and
ability to put your own website up and

2991
01:21:30,061 --> 01:21:32,620
control your own content
and express yourself in any,

2992
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:33,271
in any way,

2993
01:21:33,271 --> 01:21:34,830
shape form you choose.

2994
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:40,100
And the benefits of that have been
staggering to our culture over the last

2995
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:40,850
couple of years.

2996
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:41,100
Yeah,

2997
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,480
just just over the last 10,

2998
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:43,350
you know,

2999
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:48,350
and the idea that corporations might
have the ability to step in and stop that

3000
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:54,440
or regulate that or restrict that or
sensor you if in anything that you do and

3001
01:21:54,691 --> 01:21:55,524
somehow or another,

3002
01:21:55,620 --> 01:22:00,360
if anything you do and somehow or another
a one way or a forms cost them money

3003
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,120
and they decide that this is
something that has to be stopped.

3004
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:04,740
They're going to be able to do that.

3005
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:08,580
Unless West we do something and when
somebody realizes they have their hand on

3006
01:22:08,581 --> 01:22:11,220
the faucet and they have the ability
to turn it on and turn it off,

3007
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:12,240
people get crazy.

3008
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:13,170
You've seen that study.

3009
01:22:13,171 --> 01:22:13,710
It's like Ted,

3010
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:16,340
like these 10 people power.

3011
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:16,680
Yeah.

3012
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:20,190
They do this shit where they invite
these people to go talk and they actually

3013
01:22:20,191 --> 01:22:22,530
don't put up everybody's
talks until this year.

3014
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:26,790
They used to pick and choose and cherry
pick the talks they put up and you would

3015
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:27,840
go there for a week,

3016
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:29,310
15 hours a day,

3017
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:32,910
do all their shit and then imagine
if they didn't put up your talk.

3018
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:34,020
But what have you talked socks.

3019
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,310
If you're talk sucked,

3020
01:22:35,311 --> 01:22:39,300
I feel like it should just go suck
on the internet or on the Internet,

3021
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:39,870
you know?

3022
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:40,291
Right.

3023
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:42,480
But maybe yes and no,

3024
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,433
because if,

3025
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:47,690
if you say if you had a
comedy conference and uh,

3026
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,350
you had all these comedians do sets,

3027
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:50,880
but some of them were just dog shit.

3028
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:54,120
You want that set to represent your,

3029
01:22:54,121 --> 01:22:54,871
your company?

3030
01:22:54,871 --> 01:22:55,221
No,

3031
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:55,620
you would.

3032
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:56,453
You know,

3033
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,473
you wouldn't do it.

3034
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:57,830
Yeah,

3035
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:58,663
I wouldn't,

3036
01:22:59,100 --> 01:22:59,461
you know,

3037
01:22:59,461 --> 01:23:00,350
if I did though,

3038
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,360
invite someone and they stayed
for a week and I didn't pay them,

3039
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:03,991
I would be like,

3040
01:23:03,991 --> 01:23:07,720
the least I owe you is opportunity that
quite possibly there's three people on

3041
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:09,330
the planet or at that enjoy your son.

3042
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,070
You know what I mean?

3043
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,370
Yeah.

3044
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:11,380
That's one point.

3045
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:11,591
Yeah,

3046
01:23:11,591 --> 01:23:12,191
that's a point.

3047
01:23:12,191 --> 01:23:13,420
I guess if I know what you're saying,

3048
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,201
to protect the brand,

3049
01:23:14,201 --> 01:23:15,100
it makes a little sense,

3050
01:23:15,101 --> 01:23:15,970
but you know,

3051
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:16,631
for the most part,

3052
01:23:16,631 --> 01:23:18,160
most people's talks are fucking good.

3053
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:18,541
Yeah.

3054
01:23:18,541 --> 01:23:19,480
They're there for a reason,

3055
01:23:19,481 --> 01:23:23,260
so it's probably really different than
going to get an open miker Ted Talker,

3056
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:25,040
but it's not a bringer show here.

3057
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:25,660
Right.

3058
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:28,300
But they give opportunities to
a lot of weird people mean it.

3059
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:29,590
It's absolutely possible.

3060
01:23:29,591 --> 01:23:30,424
There must be.

3061
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:32,080
I bet if we just ask a bit,

3062
01:23:32,081 --> 01:23:32,831
we're ignorant to it,

3063
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:33,640
but we just say,

3064
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,750
show me the Ted talks.

3065
01:23:34,751 --> 01:23:35,870
That sucker fat Dick.

3066
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:37,811
Okay.

3067
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:38,470
Twitter,

3068
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:39,161
twitter people,

3069
01:23:39,161 --> 01:23:44,080
please show me the Ted talks that soccer
fat dick one wants to see the Sarah

3070
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:44,081
Silverman.

3071
01:23:44,081 --> 01:23:44,740
Ted Talk.

3072
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:45,790
There was never let out.

3073
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,480
She gave.

3074
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,560
She gave us never let happen.

3075
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:47,990
No,

3076
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:49,840
they never let it out
because she made fun of Ted.

3077
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:50,501
See,

3078
01:23:50,501 --> 01:23:52,570
I would've fucking wanted
to watch that immediate.

3079
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:53,050
Really.

3080
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:53,591
And the thing is,

3081
01:23:53,591 --> 01:23:55,140
if you're confident in
is that you're allowed,

3082
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:56,350
you can laugh at yourself.

3083
01:23:56,351 --> 01:23:57,750
They don't know how to
laugh at themselves.

3084
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:58,571
She made fun of Ted.

3085
01:23:58,571 --> 01:23:59,350
In what way?

3086
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:00,400
Like during her talk,

3087
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:01,960
it's like the mythology of it.

3088
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:03,400
I didn't see the talk obviously,

3089
01:24:03,401 --> 01:24:05,320
but was the Sarah Silverman Ted talk?

3090
01:24:05,321 --> 01:24:06,154
They never let out.

3091
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,120
Wow.

3092
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:07,880
We need to get serious.

3093
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:08,713
I

3094
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,050
need to run into her somewhere.

3095
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:11,560
I could.

3096
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,393
I couldn't make it happen.

3097
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:12,581
Okay.

3098
01:24:12,581 --> 01:24:13,414
Am I going to happen her?

3099
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:13,901
Um,

3100
01:24:13,901 --> 01:24:14,734
I,

3101
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:17,620
I've never heard anything
bad about ted before,

3102
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:19,540
so that's why this is such a shock.

3103
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:20,590
It is weird though.

3104
01:24:20,591 --> 01:24:23,890
You meet the donors and stuff and
they can't tell Asian people apart.

3105
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:26,260
They can't tell African
people apart and it's just,

3106
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:27,250
it's weird man.

3107
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,320
They're nice and everybody means well.

3108
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,580
Did they call you David Choe?

3109
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:33,090
No.

3110
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:37,240
They mistake you for other fellows
because so many of them are Asian.

3111
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:38,260
Really?

3112
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:38,831
That's funny.

3113
01:24:38,831 --> 01:24:39,490
Yeah.

3114
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:41,350
How many different
people do it every year?

3115
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,160
Every year they pick like 20 fellows and
then they pick a bunch of other people

3116
01:24:45,161 --> 01:24:46,060
for the main stage.

3117
01:24:46,061 --> 01:24:47,170
So yeah,

3118
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:47,471
I mean,

3119
01:24:47,471 --> 01:24:48,304
no it is.

3120
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:49,810
It is a ill organization.

3121
01:24:49,811 --> 01:24:50,171
I still,

3122
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:51,430
even though they booted me today,

3123
01:24:51,431 --> 01:24:51,940
I,

3124
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:52,960
I love the speakers.

3125
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:55,090
I love the talks and
I want it to continue,

3126
01:24:55,091 --> 01:24:56,410
but I hope that they,

3127
01:24:56,411 --> 01:24:57,180
at least,

3128
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:57,490
you know,

3129
01:24:57,490 --> 01:24:59,140
they could say I suck and that's fine.

3130
01:24:59,141 --> 01:24:59,531
They can be like,

3131
01:24:59,531 --> 01:25:00,340
Eddie's a shithead.

3132
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,091
He went to la,

3133
01:25:01,091 --> 01:25:03,040
he did the fucking podcast and he sucks,

3134
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:05,590
but I hope they just changed
the rules for future people.

3135
01:25:05,591 --> 01:25:07,080
So there's something you
didn't do anything wrong.

3136
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:12,150
They're crazy and all they represent is
a distribution method for the greatest

3137
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:13,840
minds on earth.

3138
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,040
That's all they represent.

3139
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:17,170
It's not the baby are the
greatest minds on earth.

3140
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:19,750
It's just there's so many
interesting people today.

3141
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,380
We live in an amazing time
and just when you good,

3142
01:25:23,381 --> 01:25:24,520
something like Ted,

3143
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:26,590
whatever that Ted stands for,

3144
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:29,740
it became synonymous on the
Internet with fascinating talks.

3145
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:30,850
Boom.

3146
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:31,683
And then it's off.

3147
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:32,593
Yeah.

3148
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:34,740
You could do the Eddie Wong's,

3149
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,590
you know,

3150
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:36,161
fascinating.

3151
01:25:36,161 --> 01:25:39,250
Motherfuckers on bias and
do the exact same thing.

3152
01:25:39,251 --> 01:25:39,670
Yeah,

3153
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:43,540
I think there's a lot of room for that
because conferences like I would love to

3154
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:45,910
hear more people from downtown La,

3155
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,640
downtown New York and talking and doing
these ideas because they don't find

3156
01:25:48,641 --> 01:25:49,091
those dudes.

3157
01:25:49,091 --> 01:25:50,140
They find academics,

3158
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:52,240
they find people playing
ancient instruments.

3159
01:25:52,241 --> 01:25:53,560
They find people that are,

3160
01:25:53,561 --> 01:25:53,980
you know,

3161
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:55,240
working nature things and,

3162
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,670
and they have their kind
of like cultural sect,

3163
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:58,510
you know,

3164
01:25:58,510 --> 01:26:01,080
but there is a lot of room to
find genius and other places,

3165
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:02,470
geniuses everywhere you know this,

3166
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:03,800
you travel around the world,

3167
01:26:03,801 --> 01:26:05,090
you find genius anywhere.

3168
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:08,870
So there's room for conferences that like
look under different cultures because

3169
01:26:08,871 --> 01:26:10,850
they're kind of looking under
the same stones all the time.

3170
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:11,600
Right.

3171
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,210
And they're going to run out
of bugs and I'm one of the.

3172
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:16,520
I'm one of the first time
they've stepped out to be like,

3173
01:26:16,521 --> 01:26:17,354
all right,

3174
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,193
there's this dude,

3175
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:18,891
he's Chinese.

3176
01:26:18,891 --> 01:26:19,611
He's into hip hop.

3177
01:26:19,611 --> 01:26:20,750
He lives in downtown New York.

3178
01:26:20,751 --> 01:26:21,770
He used to sell drugs.

3179
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:23,210
He now has a restaurant.

3180
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:27,170
I think I was the only working
chef that was a ted fellow.

3181
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:27,940
So I,

3182
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:30,140
I was one of their choices
that was really out there,

3183
01:26:30,141 --> 01:26:31,160
but it just didn't work out,

3184
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:34,310
but it didn't work out because you're
not willing to be a fucking slave and

3185
01:26:34,311 --> 01:26:36,770
sleep in a hotel room with
a stranger for a week.

3186
01:26:36,771 --> 01:26:37,160
Yeah,

3187
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:37,993
that's insane.

3188
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:39,650
I rehearsed for two days.

3189
01:26:39,651 --> 01:26:40,540
I fucking did the PTO.

3190
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:42,260
I did everything I'm supposed
to do and then I was like,

3191
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:44,060
I'm going to just piece
out for like a half day.

3192
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:44,650
And they bugged.

3193
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:45,261
Wow.

3194
01:26:45,261 --> 01:26:46,094
You know you,

3195
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:46,730
that's,

3196
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:47,563
that's crazy.

3197
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:48,770
And it's the fact that they don't pay you.

3198
01:26:48,771 --> 01:26:49,520
It's crazy.

3199
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,290
You guys need to do a vice
show exposing Ted tabs.

3200
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:54,570
I told vice that I,

3201
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:56,540
I told him that before I got booted.

3202
01:26:56,541 --> 01:26:57,440
I sent them an email like,

3203
01:26:57,441 --> 01:26:57,621
Yo,

3204
01:26:57,621 --> 01:26:58,520
you got to see this shit.

3205
01:26:58,521 --> 01:27:00,560
It's like the beginnings of scientology.

3206
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:02,480
Wow.

3207
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:07,550
It is so true that once people have a
position of power and influence and people

3208
01:27:07,551 --> 01:27:08,780
want to be a part of them,

3209
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,370
people go corrupt.

3210
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,433
Yup.

3211
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:15,680
What is the threshold at which
something becomes a religion?

3212
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:16,550
You know,

3213
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:17,600
it's kind of insane.

3214
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,880
It's so easy to start a cult today.

3215
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:22,580
There's so many people
looking to jump on board,

3216
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,180
you know,

3217
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:26,600
all the people that would have 100
years ago become Catholics now.

3218
01:27:26,601 --> 01:27:26,900
They're like,

3219
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:27,733
man,

3220
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,720
Pope just won't stop fucking kids.

3221
01:27:29,721 --> 01:27:30,680
I can't do this.

3222
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:32,240
I needed a new cult.

3223
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,250
I don't know why people
still believe in these.

3224
01:27:34,251 --> 01:27:36,200
Really like you look at
what these people are doing,

3225
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:37,220
like what these.

3226
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:39,890
What's happening in the
Catholic church is insane.

3227
01:27:39,891 --> 01:27:43,460
Fucking popes resigning because the
first time it's gotten so hot that the

3228
01:27:43,461 --> 01:27:43,911
pope's like,

3229
01:27:43,911 --> 01:27:44,744
I'm Outta here.

3230
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,790
He's asked for immunity from the Catholic,

3231
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:48,650
from the Italian government,

3232
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:52,940
from prosecution because he's
responsible for shielding pedophiles.

3233
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,110
He personally,

3234
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:55,520
and a lot of people don't know this,

3235
01:27:55,610 --> 01:28:00,610
the pope personally responsible for taking
pedophiles and shifting them away to

3236
01:28:01,161 --> 01:28:02,810
another place where
they molested more kids.

3237
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:03,910
And what would you expect?

3238
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:04,400
You don't.

3239
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,110
These people aren't allowed to have sex.

3240
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,910
It's natural to want to have sex.

3241
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:10,220
It's natural to want to
go to La and do podcasts.

3242
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:10,460
You know,

3243
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:13,820
as soon as you cannot come to
Ted and have sex without condoms,

3244
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:14,181
I'd be like,

3245
01:28:14,181 --> 01:28:14,700
fuck that.

3246
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:14,850
You,

3247
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:17,750
you imagine no unprotected sex.

3248
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:18,770
There's no raw dogging.

3249
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:19,880
Attend illegal.

3250
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:21,710
No Ass fucking while you're here.

3251
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:22,573
Oh Man.

3252
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:23,810
You're a ted fellow.

3253
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:24,693
There would be a mutiny.

3254
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,370
I wonder if they would have like you,

3255
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:29,930
you could slowly start
imposing behavior standards.

3256
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:30,190
You know,

3257
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:30,861
on fellows,

3258
01:28:30,861 --> 01:28:31,011
you know,

3259
01:28:31,011 --> 01:28:32,770
if you want to call it
like a ted fellow or,

3260
01:28:32,771 --> 01:28:34,820
or whatever new organization
you want to start.

3261
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:35,481
They do shit.

3262
01:28:35,481 --> 01:28:36,590
Like you should have a standing.

3263
01:28:36,591 --> 01:28:38,680
You should give a standing
ovation when this person calls me,

3264
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:39,580
you should do this and that.

3265
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:40,310
It's crazy.

3266
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:41,143
Yeah.

3267
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:42,081
Wait a minute,

3268
01:28:42,081 --> 01:28:42,590
wait a minute.

3269
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:44,090
Fake standing ovations.

3270
01:28:44,091 --> 01:28:44,301
Yeah.

3271
01:28:44,301 --> 01:28:45,440
And they were also saying like,

3272
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:45,771
you know,

3273
01:28:45,771 --> 01:28:46,581
when the founder comes,

3274
01:28:46,581 --> 01:28:47,590
Chris Anderson comes like,

3275
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:49,520
you don't have to give
him a standing ovation.

3276
01:28:49,521 --> 01:28:49,910
Like,

3277
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:50,331
you know,

3278
01:28:50,331 --> 01:28:51,240
it's nice if you want to,

3279
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:53,120
but he doesn't actually need you to do it.

3280
01:28:53,121 --> 01:28:56,810
I'm like the fact that you needed to
give me this fake halfway disclaimers.

3281
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:58,100
So fucking strange.

3282
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:58,611
Wow.

3283
01:28:58,611 --> 01:28:59,890
That's so strange.

3284
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:04,980
Are they tell you who to and not to give
standing ovations to who's allowed to

3285
01:29:05,101 --> 01:29:05,551
apply.

3286
01:29:05,551 --> 01:29:09,540
You have to apply to go to Ted to attend
and then once you're accepted you pay

3287
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:10,650
$8,000.

3288
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:12,871
That's a mind.

3289
01:29:12,871 --> 01:29:13,440
Fuck.

3290
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,310
Wait a minute.

3291
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:15,493
You had to pay.

3292
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:15,781
No.

3293
01:29:15,781 --> 01:29:16,290
Hell No.

3294
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:18,010
I'm like,

3295
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:19,041
okay.

3296
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:22,400
So the people that attend these
strict audience members are saying,

3297
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:22,600
Oh,

3298
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:25,200
you gotta want to be so
down so bad to do that,

3299
01:29:25,201 --> 01:29:27,570
to go through an application
process and then fucking pay.

3300
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,470
That's a lot of money.

3301
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:29,670
How many people are going?

3302
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:30,630
How many people go?

3303
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:30,980
I don't know.

3304
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:31,331
I think,

3305
01:29:31,331 --> 01:29:31,580
uh,

3306
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:32,690
like 2000,

3307
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:33,533
3000.

3308
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:35,610
Holy Shit.

3309
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:37,110
That's a lot of money.

3310
01:29:37,111 --> 01:29:37,650
They make.

3311
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:38,700
Holy Shit.

3312
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:39,390
Yeah.

3313
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:40,320
That's a lot of money.

3314
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:40,860
Yeah.

3315
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:41,693
They make off of you.

3316
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:42,750
Yeah.

3317
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:45,570
Two thousand people
paying $8,000 is how much?

3318
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:47,310
A six,

3319
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:47,941
300.

3320
01:29:47,941 --> 01:29:48,774
60,000.

3321
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:50,773
What is it?

3322
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:52,040
One hundred $60,000.

3323
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:52,580
No,

3324
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:53,280
be more.

3325
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:53,521
No,

3326
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:54,480
it's way more than that.

3327
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:56,070
It's like $16 million I think,

3328
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:57,240
but yeah,

3329
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:01,140
$2,000 times 16 million.

3330
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:02,003
Two thousand 10.

3331
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:07,360
You don't know shit about your numbers
and I didn't even bother to count Asian

3332
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:07,950
always.

3333
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:11,290
I'm asking agents from
now on $60 million in use.

3334
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:12,270
Silly Birch,

3335
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:14,911
what is it,

3336
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:15,370
Brian?

3337
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:20,370
Do you ever calculator built in
what's number 2000 times a thousand?

3338
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:23,070
Be Sixteen dollars million.

3339
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:26,100
What's 2000 times $8,000?

3340
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:31,970
This might answer your question.

3341
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:32,940
Uh,

3342
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:33,773
it is

3343
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,910
one point $6 million I think.

3344
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:36,380
Oh,

3345
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:37,530
one point 6 million.

3346
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:38,633
That was one off.

3347
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:39,473
I was excited.

3348
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:40,170
Okay.

3349
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:40,651
That makes sense.

3350
01:30:40,651 --> 01:30:41,430
A lot of bread.

3351
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:43,230
So they made one point 6 million.

3352
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:44,503
Sixteen million.

3353
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:48,150
16 million human calculator was fast.

3354
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,013
Very nice.

3355
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:49,591
So,

3356
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:49,860
um,

3357
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:50,850
they made 16 million,

3358
01:30:50,851 --> 01:30:51,900
which is even crazier.

3359
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:57,210
And they did this in this time where
you were there and no one got paid.

3360
01:30:57,211 --> 01:30:57,750
Paid.

3361
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:58,680
Nobody got paid.

3362
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:00,160
Wow.

3363
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:00,970
Yup.

3364
01:31:00,970 --> 01:31:01,771
We're suckers.

3365
01:31:01,771 --> 01:31:02,604
Dude.

3366
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:03,450
Why soccer?

3367
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:05,610
And they're always telling you
like you're going to get exposure.

3368
01:31:05,611 --> 01:31:06,444
It was like no lie.

3369
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,490
More people listening to
the Joe Rogan experience.

3370
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:09,541
That's true.

3371
01:31:09,541 --> 01:31:09,930
Ted.

3372
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:11,720
Suck it Ted.

3373
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,740
We got you beat by like a million,

3374
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:15,660
but that's still nuts,

3375
01:31:15,661 --> 01:31:16,200
man.

3376
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,190
That's a lot of money.

3377
01:31:17,191 --> 01:31:18,210
We're not making that money.

3378
01:31:18,211 --> 01:31:19,044
We need to make that money.

3379
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:20,640
People.

3380
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,450
Joe Rogan.

3381
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:22,710
$10,000,000 each.

3382
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:23,723
I know how to do it.

3383
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:27,600
I'm going to just raise the bar and
only get really stupid rich people.

3384
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:28,201
I'm not,

3385
01:31:28,201 --> 01:31:28,530
you know,

3386
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:31,500
I don't want to like go after poor
people because I think that's rude.

3387
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:32,580
So a million.

3388
01:31:32,581 --> 01:31:33,414
You got bolt soon.

3389
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:34,393
My bad.

3390
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:34,590
No,

3391
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:34,971
that's all right.

3392
01:31:34,971 --> 01:31:35,251
You have.

3393
01:31:35,251 --> 01:31:35,941
What are you doing next?

3394
01:31:35,941 --> 01:31:36,631
What do you got going on?

3395
01:31:36,631 --> 01:31:37,050
I got it.

3396
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:37,861
I got a meeting,

3397
01:31:37,861 --> 01:31:38,191
you know,

3398
01:31:38,191 --> 01:31:40,620
La meetings and BC shit.

3399
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:41,430
Bullshit.

3400
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:42,031
Bullshit,

3401
01:31:42,031 --> 01:31:42,480
dude.

3402
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,170
My bad.

3403
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:44,070
What are you going to do next?

3404
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,750
Is Go to another show you're
working on after the show.

3405
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:47,370
Uh,

3406
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:47,980
yeah.

3407
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:48,361
Tell us,

3408
01:31:48,361 --> 01:31:48,920
give us,

3409
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:49,650
you know,

3410
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:50,630
to be on NBC.

3411
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:53,850
We optioning the book like the
real is going to become a sitcom.

3412
01:31:53,851 --> 01:31:54,760
We want to.

3413
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:57,240
Margaret Cho moratorium has been lifted,

3414
01:31:58,930 --> 01:31:59,201
right?

3415
01:31:59,201 --> 01:32:02,050
The Margaret Cho Moratorium on
Asian television has been lifted.

3416
01:32:02,051 --> 01:32:04,270
We want to do a sitcom from,

3417
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:05,070
from the books.

3418
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:06,010
So that's fascinating.

3419
01:32:06,011 --> 01:32:06,940
Like Chelsea lately.

3420
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:07,923
Yeah.

3421
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,310
Well I have not seen that,

3422
01:32:09,311 --> 01:32:13,090
but all I know is my dad's dream was to
be Al Bundy and hopefully someone can

3423
01:32:13,091 --> 01:32:13,924
play it.

3424
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:14,471
Al Bundy.

3425
01:32:14,471 --> 01:32:15,220
Like my dad.

3426
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:16,053
Wow.

3427
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:19,540
Are you going to lock Bobby Lee
up to a longterm deal right now?

3428
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,453
I will show.

3429
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:25,300
I was kinda hoping run our
tests would go yellow face.

3430
01:32:25,370 --> 01:32:28,220
So what can they do with CGI?

3431
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:29,060
Did the,

3432
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:30,050
what's his name and Tron.

3433
01:32:30,230 --> 01:32:31,940
Can they do that with an American actor?

3434
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,070
Could they do that?

3435
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:35,120
Just have some family.

3436
01:32:35,121 --> 01:32:38,330
There's five people I kind of want to
just get the like Michigan Fab five

3437
01:32:38,331 --> 01:32:40,690
together and yellow face go yellow face.

3438
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:42,253
Just tape.

3439
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:43,040
It is funny.

3440
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:43,760
What was that?

3441
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:44,250
Networks?

3442
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:45,650
Which Asian actor would
you want to be like?

3443
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,070
I Dunno,

3444
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:47,870

3445
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:49,063
There was um,

3446
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,870
there was a Chinese,

3447
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:56,240
a Chinese investigator that
they used to Charlie Chan.

3448
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:59,840
And in the movie it was a white
guy that played Charlie Chan.

3449
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:00,973
Do you know that?

3450
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:03,020
The original Charlie Chan?

3451
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:03,261
Yeah,

3452
01:33:03,261 --> 01:33:05,480
the original Charlie Chan was,

3453
01:33:05,481 --> 01:33:06,314
um,

3454
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:07,490
it was uh,

3455
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:08,660
some old dude.

3456
01:33:08,661 --> 01:33:09,494
Hold on a second.

3457
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:15,860
Charlie Chan was like
this wise old school.

3458
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:18,110
A detective.

3459
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:19,401
But yeah,

3460
01:33:19,401 --> 01:33:21,140
it was played by Warner.

3461
01:33:21,141 --> 01:33:22,070
Oh land.

3462
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:23,870

My Dick is hard just thinking about this,

3519
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:24,140

Mr. greer wants to hear him being a

3520
01:35:24,141 --> 01:35:26,060
distinguished gentleman of science.
