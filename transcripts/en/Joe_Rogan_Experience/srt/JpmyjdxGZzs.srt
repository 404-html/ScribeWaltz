1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,130
Brownies,
a one 80 for two brawny sweet 90 a

2
00:00:03,131 --> 00:00:06,120
piece.
And you got visa at one 25

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,830
because my kid loves edible.
We're live.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,130
We're live.
How much you want one of these?

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,120
Explain what's going on in that Joey.
Fourth one,

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,370
right?
These are star.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,040
These are the stars.
A debt.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,600
So these purple ones are 200 milligrams.
This is what you know.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,270
This is a tech one knows I'll sleep for
three days.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,420
This is one.
How many,

11
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:38,190
how many milligrams are in those 200 and
this one?

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,080
You just throw it 200 down.
I want something to go.

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,650
You got to go.
No pick.

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,680
I don't know if you know,
but like an effective doses.

15
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:51,360
20
pop to 200 and in fact

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,280
he'll drive.
Well,

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,670
why can't I can't.
I can't smoke.

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,890
I can eat.
I can eat.

19
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,580
I can open up with three of these.
I can open up with 600 milligrams

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,280
at bed at night like a baby.
I put that mask on.

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,140
I sleep like a fucking baby.
Sometimes I get paranoid my sleep and I

22
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:17,920
wake up at three in the morning with my
heart pounds.

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,020
I wake my wife up.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,430
I tell you what,
I'll tell you why I stay away from the

25
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:27,060
edible cause like I like to smoke at
night.

26
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:27,963
Right,
right.

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,160
All right.
Second High,

28
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:31,650
one night and when I was at this one
place,

29
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:34,530
they gave me some edibles.
They gave me a bag of popcorn.

30
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,460
Okay,
I'm a little stoned out and I just want

31
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:40,260
something neat.
So I open up the popcorn.

32
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,330
Okay.
Now the next day Valerie is,

33
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,970
she can't figure out why I'm not waking
up.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,240
I slept for 19 hours and she found the
wrap up under the bench are starting to

35
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:58,401
panic like what happened to him?
I slept till till midnight the next day

36
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,580
she goes so big.
I said,

37
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,190
I didn't know I was stoned out.
I just want to some neat,

38
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,180
it was popcorn.
I didn't think they really like,

39
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,710
they even get it in the popcorn.
They make it with the butter.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,310
These cannabis butter,
I don't.

41
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,610
They pop it in the butter and then they
might even sprinkle some butter on top

42
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:19,530
of it.
Some cannabis butter and fuck you up.

43
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,880
Take out fruit now.
So they had a benefit of pot benefit at

44
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:25,920
the store and they were handed out those
bags,

45
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,770
bags of that popcorn.
It was fucking death.

46
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:30,740
Death or open it up.
It smells like pure,

47
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,010
pure fucking weed.
I felt so vulnerable.

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,940
I just love how open it is now.
Great.

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,580
We can talk about it.
You're popping them like tic tacs,

50
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,900
but dice not everywhere else.
If you'd tried to do this in Texas,

51
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,130
they'll fucking dog cops waiting for you
outside.

52
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,350
Yeah,
but I have no reason to be in Texas.

53
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,630
You don't do shows in Texas?
I don't believe in it.

54
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,650
No.
I've gone to Texas,

55
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,440
but like I,
you know in Vegas it's great.

56
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,400
Now they're opening up places.
Yeah,

57
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,570
they got five stores,
right?

58
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,580
Yeah.
I haven't gone to any of them.

59
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:06,800
I normally bring my on stuff,
you know,

60
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:08,230
or you know,
if I go to New York,

61
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:11,500
I'll bring my own stuff.
It's one of the easiest businesses.

62
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,180
And that the bar,
at the end of the day,

63
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,460
businessmen want to be businessman.
They want to make some money and they,

64
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:17,890
they look at this thing and they go,
hey,

65
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,170
do you have much fucking money they're
making in Colorado?

66
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,800
They made more money in taxes and
Colorado from weed and they did alcohol.

67
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,420
That's never happened anywhere.
That's a fucking on.

68
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,480
Definitely take weed over alcohol.
I need 100% because you,

69
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,020
you know what I always say like with
weed,

70
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,280
like a stone does,
you are,

71
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,240
let's take off a bit.

72
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,000
There's some kind of emergency,
you know what I mean?

73
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,340
You just throw water in your face.
It's gone.

74
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,310
It's not like alcohol,
you know?

75
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,840
Wait,
you don't know what you're doing.

76
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,321
Right,
right,

77
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:44,021
right.
You know what I mean?

78
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:47,140
You could perform on the weeds.
You can bang on the weed.

79
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,380
You could bang more on the wheels.
Better.

80
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,860
Listen,
he's dying and on the way you read one

81
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,780
of these stars,
ain't no water going to help you

82
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,210
find an apartment.
You're eating like a pint of this stuff.

83
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:07,710
Talking about smoking pot in the
meridium was til I go home.

84
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:11,860
At night after doing comment,
I'm so fired up geology that calms me

85
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:14,110
down.
It was one of these h bombs and a

86
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:16,870
fucking joint of death.
Like I'll smoke three pipelines.

87
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,680
Does God,
have you ever seen his periscope show?

88
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,240
No.
It's the best thing.

89
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,640
And they do it at eight 30 in the
morning.

90
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,300
I just go out there and start giving
advice and stuff.

91
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:31,250
She gets in trouble for doing both.
Like I was doing a periscope with

92
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:32,860
wheels,
you know,

93
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,620
and I get a call from Bruce,
he's going,

94
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,400
what are you guys doing?
Because we've got all stoned out and now

95
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:43,780
we're in the bathroom of my hotel room.
He turned into like into a steam room

96
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,890
and you could hardly see it.
She seemed like fucking glasses,

97
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,490
you know?
And I get a call from him,

98
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,220
he's gone,
what are you guys doing out there?

99
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,181
They go,
no,

100
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:55,721
it's,
it's,

101
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:58,530
it's a new show.
I'm doing the periscope Scott pickle

102
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,373
thing,
you know,

103
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,470
and he goes,
this spending millions of dollars from

104
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:06,580
showtime to film this and you're doing
it for nothing.

105
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,770
Get it off the air,
you know?

106
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,350
Right.
Bruce,

107
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,470
didn't you get,
I got a whole thing happened.

108
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:12,700
That's ridiculous advice.

109
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,600
What would you take that off the air?
Because we were first going to film my

110
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:18,040
series,
you know,

111
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,260
and they go,
they're writing episodes about this.

112
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:24,130
You can't just periscope it jumped,
try to change his image.

113
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:28,090
He's killing it.
Who let the manager in here?

114
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,320
You got to understand this guy has got a
history you would love,

115
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,790
you know,
cause stumble one,

116
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,670
he,
he's,

117
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,860
he built the whole career again,
but you can't tell someone to not do

118
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:43,500
periscope or they're not do twitter.
I understood that Martin,

119
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,940
when a networks putting up millions of
dollars,

120
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,940
the first film a show,
right about these things.

121
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:52,150
I do.
You don't just get it up off the air.

122
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,070
Fuck yeah,
of course.

123
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,080
He felt bad about it.
About seeing you.

124
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,460
Well,
only bad part was like,

125
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,140
I had this,
this,

126
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,680
this fight with wheels.
Like where I attack them in the room and

127
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:05,720
we'll just go and you know,
I go,

128
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,411
he goes,
you know,

129
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,244
I'm a wrestler.

130
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,690
You know,
I'm like,

131
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:09,560
yeah,
okay.

132
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,330
You know,
I'm not worried about it and I,

133
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:15,800
and I'm having eleanor do the filming
where I come into the room and I and I

134
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:19,040
jump them on his bed and he actually got
me,

135
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,680
he flipped me off like a professional
wrestler.

136
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,310
He legitimately got me.
Do you know how angry that got me?

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,390
It looked like an hole.
The tap you out or did he just know he

138
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:30,830
pinned me.
I was done.

139
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,140
Like he really knows that and to that
shit.

140
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:37,640
He's like a genius with certain things.
Like I would understand if you could do

141
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,290
it.
I get what you can do,

142
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,350
but I'm going its wheels.
There's no way he's on the bottom of

143
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:46,610
ready.
I got him and he just flipped me like a

144
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:48,950
toy.
See now if you filmed that and put that

145
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,000
on Youtube,
I put her,

146
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,120
I put it on the the periscope pickle
thing.

147
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,040
Why would you ever take something like
that down?

148
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,940
Because I got yelled at.
I always get an up to sit.

149
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,880
I know that way of thinking.
I know the way of thinking,

150
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,000
but the more view the better.
It's just going to make people want to

151
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:06,950
see him.
It was funny fucking shirt.

152
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,010
It was funny.
It's crazy when you were,

153
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:11,420
when you were doing that.
Sorry.

154
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:13,310
I was,
I remember doing that filming at the

155
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:15,380
store.
You were doing that fucking years and

156
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:17,630
years and years and years ago.
You do little sketches.

157
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,390
No,
well I want to take all that stuff now

158
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:24,620
and just cut it up and do like little
three minute things and put it on that

159
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:27,230
funny or die stuff because everybody
was,

160
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,600
you were in it every month.
Everybody played apart.

161
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,630
Bobby.
Hey,

162
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,700
do what?
The foreign comic,

163
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,561
uh,
my,

164
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:37,940
which your Bronnie we'd call them the
foreign comic,

165
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,080
you know,
and it was just these crazy epic,

166
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,670
I remember you coming over to me one
night and you go [inaudible] give you

167
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:50,300
something because that was using the
comedy store like a set,

168
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,880
you know,
I'd be filming,

169
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,800
I changed all the lighting in the
kitchen.

170
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,170
I couldn't the red lights and blue
lights for filming.

171
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,390
I was doing it for a year and the cut
and waitresses would come in to get like

172
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,030
drink orders and I go,
I can't have you in right now.

173
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:06,980
We're filming.
You can't be in.

174
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,580
You're in my shot.
And everybody's asking like managers,

175
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:13,940
like what show is this?
That was no show,

176
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,090
but everybody was in it.
Steve Reynolds easy was in it.

177
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,850
My black was mike book.
Oh,

178
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,880
I become friends with my fucking black.
So for whatever reason,

179
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:30,620
I come over to this guy,
he's sitting in the booth and the

180
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:32,630
kitchen and I go,
Hey Mike,

181
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:34,920
do you want to,
you want to be in the show and he's

182
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,763
going to watch you?
I go,

183
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,310
it's,
it's,

184
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,680
it's a reality show.
And reality wasn't really happening yet.

185
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,350
It just wasn't happening.
So people like,

186
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:43,460
well,
what is I go,

187
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,440
you just do what I tell you to do.

188
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,990
Just say what I tell you to say and do
what I said.

189
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:48,711
So what?
He goes,

190
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:49,550
yeah,
I want to be in it.

191
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,540
You know,
I go,

192
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,830
okay,
we're going to go to the top of the

193
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:52,840
bellies,
the,

194
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,960
uh,
the belly room,

195
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:56,250
the steps.
And I'm going to throw you down the

196
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:57,960
steps.
Okay.

197
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,030
And I,
I got to get a couple angles,

198
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:01,650
so we'll have to do with two or three
times,

199
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,223
you know,
and he goes,

200
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,230
wait a minute.
He goes,

201
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:06,180
what do you mean you're going to throw
me down the steps?

202
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:06,631
I go,
yeah,

203
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:08,880
from the top.
So you just go with it,

204
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,710
you know,
just fall down the steps.

205
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,770
And he goes,
I don't want you to do that to me.

206
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,133
Like A,
why not?

207
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,010
What's the big deal?
It's what you do.

208
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,080
He goes,
what do you mean it's what I do.

209
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,220
I go,
aren't you a stunt man?

210
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,870
And he goes,
where'd you hear that Echo?

211
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,210
The comics told me that that's what you
do besides comedy.

212
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:28,500
You're a stunt.
He comes,

213
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,740
I'm not a stunt man.
I don't want to be thrown down.

214
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,890
I want to be in it,
but I can't have you just towards me

215
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:37,590
down a full flight of steps like that.
I'm going to get hurt.

216
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,230
So we had to do it in pieces,
you know,

217
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,660
which I like a fake fall.
Well,

218
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,190
no,
he would go like halfway.

219
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,340
And then I go to the bottom of the steps
to get the rest of the fall.

220
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,850
And then I tried to like kill him with a
chair and Ari Shaffir jumps on me at the

221
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:55,710
right moment to stop me from killing the
sky.

222
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,760
It was always,
oh,

223
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,760
I could do just so I could do a line
from a bronx tale where I'm on top of

224
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:02,490
him now.

225
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,530
And I go,
I did this to you.

226
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,800
And he goes,
what will that mean?

227
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:10,200
I go,
don't worry about it when it's edited,

228
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:13,410
you'll see the whole series.
The image.

229
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,260
Yeah.
I got Jay.

230
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,840
Yeah,
doing what I tell you this,

231
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,120
cause I'd go over to comics and go,
all right,

232
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,660
look that way.
And in second say that guy's going to

233
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:24,090
have a fucking problem.
And he goes,

234
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,080
but there's nobody today.
I go,

235
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:28,240
don't worry about that part.
They'll be somebody on the other end.

236
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,960
That another time.
And that's how I would piece though.

237
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,930
So I want to take these tapes,
just have some,

238
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:37,560
some editor do like three minute because
it was,

239
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,760
I did it for two years,
did come to my house for a barbecue.

240
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,480
It wound up fighting.
Eleanor gets into a fist fight with

241
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:46,890
steve run easy.
His wife,

242
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:49,020
where he screaming,
knocked the shit out of a,

243
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,280
she's got her up against the garage
because she said eleanor like,

244
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:53,910
you know,
was,

245
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,770
is like the house is filthy.

246
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,140
You know,
and Eleanor was screaming at me in the

247
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:01,830
kitchen go and she said that when I'm so
fucking Nice to,

248
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:04,410
Huh,
I'll handle this right now in Illinois.

249
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:08,250
It comes out of the backyard now the
comic sitting there don't notice is

250
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,390
going to,
and she goes,

251
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:12,360
hey bitch,
this is to Steve's wife,

252
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:15,230
right?
And she chases us slams are against the

253
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,290
garage that's beaten.
The shit out of Heller was a pro as Mike

254
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,790
Black and Dave Taylor and Steve Simone
and my own kids screaming,

255
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,670
Kayla,
just fucking kill her.

256
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,990
And the end of that episode is Dave
Taylor,

257
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,990
you know,
at night sitting around going to go into

258
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:37,200
stand.
Do you know why all I know I did that

259
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:42,201
because girls like tracy,
but taking guys like you from eleanor

260
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,920
all her life and everybody's good and
Steve someones going.

261
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:48,480
Yeah,
the way Illinois was hitting,

262
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,240
like you could just feel it,
you know,

263
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:52,290
like raging bull.

264
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,260
Like she really wanted it.
Damage.

265
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,560
Yeah,
it's a sterile.

266
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,560
That's why we'd have barbecues just to
film.

267
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,950
It didn't,
it was nonstop.

268
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:06,340
And he comes over to me at the sterling.
What are you doing exactly what?

269
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,303
You know,
like,

270
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,390
oh,
just show my show what show,

271
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:11,950
where is it?
Where can I see it?

272
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,530
I don't know.
There'll be around and you still have

273
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:15,730
the footage,
all of it.

274
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,040
Hundreds of tapes,
hundreds of hours,

275
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,180
you know,
two fucking pauly shore,

276
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,360
you know,
stops me at the comedy store,

277
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,670
you know,
because my kids were in the show and

278
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:30,640
they were like seven and 11 at the time.
It's when I first broke up with their

279
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:33,220
mom,
so they'd be at the comedy store with

280
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:34,250
me.
You know,

281
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,340
pauly shore comes over and I'm filming
this fight between Ari Shaffir and Bobby

282
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,170
Lee where,
you know,

283
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:44,000
Ari's like throwing boxes of,
uh,

284
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,460
you know,
bottles of,

285
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:46,070
uh,
of,

286
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,180
uh,
bobby's head and everybody's cheering to

287
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:50,080
kill bobby.

288
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,370
You know,
and Paul,

289
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,360
he comes over,
he goes,

290
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,270
how many times I going to tell you,
you get these fucking kids out of the

291
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:57,430
comedy store?
And he says it in front of Dylan,

292
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,070
who's a kid.
So I tell,

293
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:00,640
see Steve Simone,
I said,

294
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,630
take dylan outside cause that's the
Vietnamese,

295
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,660
you know,
so I figured I might have to really

296
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,040
damage this kid,
you know,

297
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,460
but yeah,
it was going to hurt him,

298
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,620
you know,
but I,

299
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:15,310
I'm going all right,
then I'll get sued.

300
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:19,270
So I just lay into them and I'd throw a
glass at the wall,

301
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:21,310
you know,
to throw into the garbage and I leave

302
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,320
the next day.
Mitzi calls,

303
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:25,930
she doesn't just banned me from the
comedy store.

304
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,050
She bends my children like,
oh,

305
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:30,630
you're the youngest kids.
Definitely.

306
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,770
If you've never been banned from the
store,

307
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,400
it's not a good day and you're the
youngest to get banned.

308
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,720
You're not even eight years old.
You know how good does this feel?

309
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,090
And they're going,
but we're not allowed to go back in.

310
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:44,170
I go,
don't worry,

311
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:49,120
it'll all be straightened out.
You know who hasn't been banned from the

312
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,260
store?
Exactly.

313
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:52,300
It's the greatest.
It's like a badge of,

314
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,610
I haven't been banned after the shit you
got.

315
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:56,830
What?
What was the fight you add a couple of

316
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,940
weeks ago I would fuck.
Oh,

317
00:13:57,941 --> 00:13:59,230
but no,
I didn't get banned for that.

318
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,010
You don't talk about that at all?
Cause I heard,

319
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:05,920
fuck
you almost get into a wild Willy Parsons

320
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,360
way back in the day.
No,

321
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,740
he said some shit in the main room.
Well,

322
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:10,600
you know,
he was just,

323
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,280
it was just crazy.
It was kind of Nice and calm.

324
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:15,760
He is now.
Here's the problem that now I see.

325
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,430
Well we got there,
we were the young guys and some of the

326
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:19,620
older guys were on the way out.

327
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,410
They didn't like that.
So once in a while something would,

328
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,370
something would happen.
You know,

329
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,510
and the same and it was like guys that
would have for 10 years,

330
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,130
nothing happened.
Yes.

331
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,190
There was a few of those guys.
I'll tell you a great uh,

332
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,330
Coco story over here.
So we just became friends like the first

333
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:38,410
year.
I know this guy,

334
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,970
you know,
and he would tell me about every

335
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:45,430
restaurant in the United States.
I don't know,

336
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:48,370
he knows every restaurant where it is,
what they serve.

337
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,420
If it's good,
bad.

338
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,890
But one night I come outside and he's
getting into it with some customer.

339
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,860
Okay.
And he's sitting on the back stairs,

340
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,360
you know,
and I'm just watching cause I,

341
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:01,190
I wouldn't want to really see anybody
get hurt,

342
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,920
you know,
but you know,

343
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,270
he thinks differently.
Joey thinks a little differently,

344
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,130
but he doesn't just want to hurt the
guy.

345
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,280
What he does,
he gets all eat it up and he grabs one

346
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:18,281
of those tall like glasses from the
comedy store and he breaks it like he's

347
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,890
still in the middle of Cuba with the
sharp edge.

348
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:22,611
And I'm going,
Joey,

349
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:25,580
what are you doing?
I could put the glass down,

350
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,480
put the gun,
and he really wants to like stab the guy

351
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:32,480
in the throat with the guy.
He's a customer.

352
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,740
It's just a fucking customer and he
starts laughing and he throws the glade

353
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:40,820
sort of fight was off thing because then
we know he's going to put this guy in

354
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:44,490
the hospital because the guys did
something about his act,

355
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,260
you know that's stupid customers.
I seen you go with the car.

356
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,130
It's the funniest shit in the world.
I saw him and he's like,

357
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,020
Hey,
I only want to say what you were doing.

358
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,540
It was not,
but you were like trying to get to this

359
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,080
guy over.

360
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,280
The crowd.
Outside on the side was a guy that came.

361
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,630
He threw something at me.
He threw something at me.

362
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,570
He came up to the stage.
I came out of the stage,

363
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:11,270
threatened me and he said he was going
to wait for me outside.

364
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,250
That guy was an asshole.
Jacqueline.

365
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,080
He was hack on somebody before me to
someone who was real mean to somebody

366
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:19,400
before me.
I don't remember who it was.

367
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,610
It's just the violence involved in
comedy now.

368
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,700
It's hysterical.
This was 20 years ago or whenever it

369
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:27,950
was,
but it's been going on that long and

370
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:31,010
it's been a nice till.
There's always going to be drunks.

371
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,350
There's always going to be drunk,
asshole.

372
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,870
The drunks,
there's some people that are drunk and

373
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,310
they're fun.
They're great,

374
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,620
and there's other people that had just
belligerent.

375
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:41,120
They're gone.
They're gone.

376
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,940
You do a ton of clocks show in Vegas.
You're asking for fucking trouble.

377
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,450
How long have you do a midnight?
Those Riviera shows.

378
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,550
Oh my God,
that's nuts.

379
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,750
Yeah.
Now I just,

380
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:57,740
if somebody is really like that,
I just throw them out of the room.

381
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,570
Yeah.
You know whether they didn't do it.

382
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,160
No,
but I'll say really?

383
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,540
I,
I go,

384
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,480
I'm not making believe.
I don't like you.

385
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,090
I go,
this is my real emotion.

386
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:09,710
I go,
I have a hatred for you now.

387
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,080
I go,
you got to leave this room now.

388
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,130
And then they think it's a joke and
there's like two security guards stand

389
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:18,110
behind them.
I remember one guy looking going,

390
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,243
you're kidding.
Right?

391
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,810
I'm kidding.
Corona for what?

392
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,320
I go,
you talked,

393
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,510
there is no talking in here like it's a
classroom.

394
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,340
It's just all in effect.
And I know how you perform and I know

395
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,330
how you perform,
but,

396
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,640
but I really get mad when they don't
care what's going on with the performer

397
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,270
on stage.

398
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,850
Chappelle was at the store the other
night and some kid was yelling at him,

399
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,550
interrupting,
just yelling shit out in him.

400
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,870
Just yelling,
just yelling,

401
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,220
shouting,
what about this?

402
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:48,170
What about that?
Just different questions at him.

403
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:49,350
And finally,
people just started going,

404
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:53,550
shut the fuck up.
Like one guy yelled at and then it

405
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,890
happened to be me.
But some other people in the room yelled

406
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,230
at and it just got to this point where
people were like,

407
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:00,540
stop this.
But it should never get to that point.

408
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,030
The,
the management should step in right

409
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:03,410
there.
The,

410
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,030
the bouncers.
Outdoor gardens is a,

411
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,120
is all comedy.
Yeah,

412
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,510
that's the thing.
One of the store,

413
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,280
the one thing about the store that's
always been amazing is how many people

414
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:14,100
who work there,
who eventually became comics.

415
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,600
Joey,
uh,

416
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,970
Ari Rather Dunkin.
But,

417
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,480
um,
because of,

418
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,520
of drugs were to fucking pull up,
it will go running from the room.

419
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,810
Does he still do the fucking thing with
the yeah,

420
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,970
he's where he's like starting him.
Don't tell him.

421
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,310
Yeah.
Don't give the bidder way.

422
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,280
Not Matt Given the bid away.
I'm just saying what happens to people.

423
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,790
There's nothing better than sitting in
the back of that room when people stuck

424
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,190
getting frightened because of what?
What the puppet,

425
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,500
what's happening through the puppet and
they start running for a,

426
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,960
from that seat to leave the store.
It's the greatest moment.

427
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:55,080
Some ways my head against the wall,
those moments somewhere out there,

428
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:57,150
someone has the original puppet.
If somebody stole it,

429
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,250
I stole it.
Really?

430
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,410
Yeah.
The original public has to do the new

431
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:02,940
ones actually better than the old one
now.

432
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,420
So no Hobo puppet did to this fucking
guy ready with a skull.

433
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:11,940
That pump.
It's got a problem.

434
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,560
You fucked up.
Yeah.

435
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:16,650
You don't,
you don't pop it and pop are,

436
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,780
you're fucking kidding me with this
irrelevant here now pop.

437
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:22,680
It was fucking scary guy.
I remember that twilight zone episode

438
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,290
where the guy and the puppet,
the puppet was fucking evil.

439
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,690
It was great.
It was creepy.

440
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,730
Now who is,
who was the acting wasn't burgess

441
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:35,080
meredith.
He did the library with the glasses

442
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,290
right at the end.
Those glasses break.

443
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,100
Yup.
Yup.

444
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,460
He can't read.
Who is the guy from the odd cup ball?

445
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,530
Jack Klugman.
Jack Klugman did the pool hustler.

446
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,260
Yes he did.
And Jonathan Winters played the other

447
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:48,420
guy.
The dead guy comes back to life to play

448
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,500
him.
That's,

449
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,170
that is a good episode.
Fog.

450
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,150
That's a really good,
but that the dummy one was one of the

451
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,190
most disturbing ones,
you know,

452
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,370
cause the dummy would like wait for
everybody to leave and go camp man.

453
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,400
You could rabbi
just tell Kaleed like whoa.

454
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,610
And they would change the language a
little fucking areas.

455
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,530
We show them in the,
yeah,

456
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,830
so people know him on right to,
yeah,

457
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:23,831
I'm dice anyway,
just in case this is the greatest show.

458
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,490
You know,
you're just getting it.

459
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,980
I've done this before.
You just get in it.

460
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,580
Yeah.
It's,

461
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,170
well,
it's like opie and anthony used to do

462
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:32,790
this show.
There's no fucking around.

463
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,930
Yeah.
Just have some fun.

464
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,420
I love it.
I love it when people asking questions.

465
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:38,340
It should intervene when it to view.
Yeah.

466
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,880
Just have some fun.
Oh No,

467
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,810
I don't think,
we haven't really done a formal

468
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:46,370
interview.
I wouldn't know where to start to a

469
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,280
friendly,
to me and to influential.

470
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,220
I couldn't do any of your friends
through the years for sure.

471
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,480
Heard into Joe Rogan.
No.

472
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:57,310
Serious.
Like from the time you came to the

473
00:20:57,311 --> 00:21:00,130
store,
like you were figuring it all out and

474
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:02,500
you became this.
I remember coming over to Joe,

475
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:06,940
he has a hit fucking Sitcom on the air
and I'd always see him at the comedy

476
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:10,120
store.
I come over tomorrow night and I go,

477
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,100
how come you a here?

478
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,840
Like,
you have a hit show?

479
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:15,430
Like,
why aren't you on the road?

480
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,330
It was gone.
Yeah.

481
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,070
You know,
I got,

482
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,420
there's a lot of fucking money on the
road for a guy that has a hit show.

483
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,840
And that's,
I think when you started doing the road

484
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,970
100%,
he also told it to a,

485
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:29,080
what's his face?
Uh,

486
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,980
the guy who's the guy that,
uh,

487
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,900
works with,
uh,

488
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,210
uh,
uh,

489
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,560
Whitney camelot.
Um,

490
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,780
Kristalina.
Yeah.

491
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,891
So,
you know,

492
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:43,300
I would say delete like in the coffee
bean all the time and he crushes on

493
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,120
stage and I go,
don't you go on the road?

494
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,381
He goes,
no,

495
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:48,550
I'm writing material.
There's,

496
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,830
I go to the road,
you have a hit show.

497
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:54,640
Like what's wrong with people?
I always thought as long as I was still

498
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:56,900
doing standup,
both the goal for a lot of guys,

499
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:58,240
it was always to get a TV show.

500
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,590
Well Ari Shaffir I screamed at on the
phone like when he started doing his

501
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:05,260
show now on comedy central,
I'm on the phone with them.

502
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,130
This is like the first season at the
beginnings.

503
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,670
I call him.
I congratulate them.

504
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:12,160
I go,
so do you know your next two or three

505
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:13,210
moves?
You know,

506
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:16,060
if the show like starts taking off.
It was,

507
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,710
no,
I haven't really thought about it.

508
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,270
I go,
why not?

509
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:24,400
You're waiting 15 years for this.
You talk to me about not having money to

510
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:27,220
pay your fucking rent.
Now you have a show.

511
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,210
I don't know,
maybe,

512
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,600
maybe a club tour,
maybe we caught an album,

513
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,990
maybe do a comedy central special after
that,

514
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,520
you know,
something like that.

515
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:40,930
So if they happen to take the show and
flushing the toilet after the first

516
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:45,931
season you have a career because now
people know you like fucking retarded,

517
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,003
retarded.

518
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,370
Well already does a lot of standup.
He called me recently and he told me all

519
00:22:57,371 --> 00:22:59,410
the shit he's stolen.
It was 100% because of you.

520
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,350
I started doing the road 100% yeah,
I remember where we were.

521
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:03,900
We were sticking to that.
It was,

522
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,950
you know,
I don't even want to go back that far

523
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,260
cause you've done and come so far since
then.

524
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,930
But it was like whenever I see a comic
doing well,

525
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,370
I'll always look to like,
oh look,

526
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:14,950
this is what you gotta do.
Like you're nuts if you don't do it.

527
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,720
Well,
it meant a lot to me because when I was

528
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:18,520
a kid,
way before I got into comedy,

529
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,130
I was fanny,
yours and I was listening to you with

530
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:23,410
this girl that I was dating once we were
in the,

531
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:28,300
in the car and we were listening to it
on a cassette and a fucking house and we

532
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:29,134
were howling.

533
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,150
And this girl thought you were the
funniest thing ever.

534
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:34,300
And that was what made her cool.
Like she wasn't uptight because a lot of

535
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:37,780
people back then,
you know the people that don't realize

536
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,450
sort of the course,
your career's gone.

537
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,050
Like dice was unquestionably a different
thing.

538
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,630
I give you the biggest comic ever.
When I was a kid,

539
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,360
100% like when you were filling up
arenas,

540
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,960
there was a different thing going on
where people could repeat your shit,

541
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,230
they could say what's in the bowl bitch
and you would see 15,000 people gone.

542
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,860
Watson batch.
It's so fucking crazy.

543
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,090
And it was a different thing.
So,

544
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,520
you know,
frustrates me when,

545
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,810
when I talk about the arenas with
anybody,

546
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,070
you know,
like,

547
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,540
you know,
they always bring up the garden,

548
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,100
which was an honor,
you know,

549
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:15,530
to play.
It's the most famous arena ever.

550
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,350
And I did the two nights there,
but uh,

551
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,120
but I always tell these interviews,
I go,

552
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:20,810
do you understand?

553
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,630
I did over 300.
So I go,

554
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,640
the first tour alone was 26 cities,
over 300 of these and they'd be gone in

555
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:33,080
a matter of a couple hours before the
facebook,

556
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:36,890
before twitter,
before fucking followers I go old people

557
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:39,080
did was follow me into the fucking
arenas.

558
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,830
I go,
I wasn't tweeting and arguing with fans

559
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:44,630
on twitter.
You know,

560
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:47,510
it all became a thing.
You became a thing from Rodney

561
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:51,410
dangerfield on this book.
It was so fast.

562
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:52,690
It was gigantic.
Like with,

563
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:56,210
and this is all word of mouth,
who my point being then you hit,

564
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,370
there was a whole lot of backlash
against you.

565
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:02,030
It was so into it starting again.
It's not really like,

566
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:04,430
um,
yeah I'm doing some interviews and like

567
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,890
this one guy,
I don't want to say what newspaper.

568
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:10,310
Yeah cause it's all giant papers that
doing these profiles,

569
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:12,980
I mean now I'm going to New York next
week.

570
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,020
I've got to sit down with the New York
Times.

571
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,520
It's like crazy shit.
Again,

572
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,050
this is like the buildup since I started
doing your show from entourage to,

573
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,150
you know,
to the woody Allen thing and now

574
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:25,370
scorsese and now my own show.
It's like,

575
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,900
you know,
number one working with,

576
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,910
you know guys like Woody Allen Scorsese
was unreal and yeah,

577
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:36,020
those are too crazy.
But this one guy doing a profile piece

578
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:38,960
comes in,
he sees me in Vegas at the laugh factory

579
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:43,040
where I've been doing like a little
residency to stay like sort of low key

580
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,150
till this hits now.
And I'll,

581
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:48,590
I'll,
I'll announce dates later on the show

582
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:50,360
where I'm performing.
But anyway,

583
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,600
so I,
and,

584
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,470
and I really wanted to give this guy a
real show.

585
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,540
And the way I perform now as is very,
very theatrical.

586
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,820
It's all acted out.
You know,

587
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:04,700
I sit in a chair,
I'll stare at a guy that if for guy

588
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:06,590
goes,
I'm married 32 years,

589
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:09,410
I'll actually fall down onto a chair and
just look at him like,

590
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,900
you're kidding me,
right with I'd been married also a lot,

591
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,450
but not to the same one.

592
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,530
Like I break it up.
You throw a redhead and Youtube Burnett

593
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,510
and for eight years the same thing.
I go,

594
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,150
you know,
we might be coming friends now,

595
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:31,151
but I gotta tell you as your friend in a
lot of ways you hate yourself and I

596
00:26:32,411 --> 00:26:33,980
don't hate myself.
I go,

597
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:37,250
you don't hate yourself.
You fucking the same girl for 32 years.

598
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,370
What does that tell you?
You admitted to me you never had an

599
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:42,320
affair.
Who does that in life?

600
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,830
Who doesn't want to go out there and
stick every fucking what box they could

601
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:49,320
get their hands on?
The tip of your fucking Dick to the

602
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:50,400
root,
to your balls.

603
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,730
Just for the golf.
And even if you get caught,

604
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,670
you flipped the switch on your check.
You Go,

605
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,360
I did this for you.
You were busy with the kids.

606
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,400
You were busy with your new business.

607
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,400
I want to to stay wet.
Every load sheet talk.

608
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:08,880
I was thinking a,
you now go make me a fucking steak.

609
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,450
I don't want to talk about this no more.
So let start.

610
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,610
What's that?
The report is,

611
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:15,870
sees this.
Yeah,

612
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,080
and gets upset.
So after the show he says to me,

613
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:21,430
but obviously my show is a Gulf.
It's comedy,

614
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,250
it's a,
and he goes,

615
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,541
he goes,
guys,

616
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,940
now that you're being looked at it like
as this like,

617
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:30,870
great actor,
now why would you perform?

618
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,330
And I'm like,
you kidding me?

619
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:34,680
Right?
I go,

620
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,170
it's what I do.
It's what I love to do.

621
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,830
I'd love to affect people.
I like people to walk out of a room

622
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,630
going,
I never seen anything like that.

623
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,750
You know,
like you know when you're looking at a

624
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:49,500
guy in the crowd who's sitting with his
wife and he's with his best friend.

625
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,060
Okay.
Double date.

626
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,530
And I go,
let me tell you,

627
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:53,910
said you got a best friend.
And he goes,

628
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:54,561
yeah,
this guy,

629
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:57,960
I'm friends with him for 25 years.
He's your best friend.

630
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,980
Did your best friend ever call you one
time cause you got a hot looking wife.

631
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,450
She's got them big kettle ball,
fucking tits hanging down every holiday

632
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:09,210
he gets to Haga little too close.
Maybe.

633
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,750
When was the last time your best friend
I ever called you and said last night I

634
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:19,320
jerked off thinking about your wife and
the guy goes,

635
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:19,801
no,
I go,

636
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:20,634
never.
Right?

637
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,910
Because he's really not your friend.
I would call you.

638
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:27,270
I would tell you last night I wheel
barrel.

639
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:30,660
Fuck this animal.
She's walking on a hand picking up water

640
00:28:30,661 --> 00:28:34,010
with a teeth for me.
You know I go and then you bang her.

641
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:37,050
The way I tell you when,
if it works out like my scenario,

642
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,730
I'll give you the next scenario.

643
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,310
That's a friend,
not a guy hugging.

644
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:43,020
Your wife never turns around and says,
Oh,

645
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,620
I love your wife's fucking edge.
The way those pants split hop fucking

646
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:49,620
crease between a legs.
You might think your wife is ugly

647
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:54,390
because your friend never takes the time
to tell you how many loads he drops just

648
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:57,480
thinking about her.
So don't tell me he's your best friend.

649
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:59,850
He's your worst fucking enemy in the
world.

650
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:04,800
I'm the friend.
It all make sense and you get negative

651
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:06,840
feedback from this.
That doesn't even make any sense.

652
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,060
Well,
no,

653
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:13,350
because it's all done as a goof.
Of course,

654
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,780
like the guys going with.
Why would you do that material?

655
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:16,471
I go,
well,

656
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:19,260
what should I go on stage and go,
you've been together with a woman 32

657
00:29:19,261 --> 00:29:21,630
years.
Obviously you love your family,

658
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,690
you raise beautiful children.
Nobody wants to hear that.

659
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:25,710
But here's the question.

660
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,390
Why does it,
why does it have to make sense?

661
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,460
Why can't it just be funny?
That's my whole bike.

662
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,920
I'd like that.
You know,

663
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:33,900
I've always said that like when people
would ask me like,

664
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:35,790
what's your favorite kind of comedy?
Like,

665
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,630
I just want to laugh.
Like when Joey is saying the most

666
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:42,250
ridiculous shit,
I laugh than anything I've ever heard in

667
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:43,870
my life.
It doesn't have to make sense to me.

668
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:45,440
He's in a coma,
but it's all fine.

669
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,070
But it's like,
how come?

670
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,480
How come movies can be ridiculous?
Ridiculous in in what they're showing

671
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:53,314
you?
Ridiculous.

672
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,030
Right?
Especially violent.

673
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,870
When we think about how many violent
movies raw every fucking couple months.

674
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:01,390
There's some crazy movie where a hundred
people get shot.

675
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,740
It's constant,
right?

676
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,400
But a guy on stage just talking,
it was just absurd ways about sex.

677
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,890
Why is that pissing people off?
But even in comedies,

678
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:14,200
and it really started around the time
that came,

679
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,270
that came with,
uh,

680
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:16,990
what's,
uh,

681
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,470
I sit with those glasses on tests.

682
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,310
It's beautiful.
But,

683
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,900
but the thing is like,
it started with the,

684
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:26,080
uh,
Mary movie that Matt Dillon did years

685
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,550
ago was she's got a road trip come on
and everybody's hysterically laughing.

686
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:33,250
That's okay.
But if you say it as a comic,

687
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:34,630
it's like,
why would you say that?

688
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,310
Especially the way,
here's what I do.

689
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,460
But the way you're saying it's so,
it's so over the top,

690
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,270
it's easy.
It's absurd.

691
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,810
I don't understand why people don't just
think it's ridiculous.

692
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,050
Look at the last time I went to see a
comic,

693
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,200
it was me and Norton and Anthony Kumina
and Patrick Kelly and Bryan red band.

694
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:56,110
You weren't there were you Jamie?
And we went to see you at the river.

695
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,980
It was awesome.
I had a fucking blast.

696
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,650
I had a great time just sitting there as
an audience members watching and there's

697
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,800
some of the shit you talking about.

698
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,290
It's so preposterous.
It's,

699
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,290
it's,
it almost makes me angry that anybody

700
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:14,620
would have an argument with you.
Like saying something wrong with what

701
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:16,860
you're saying because you're saying
shit.

702
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:20,610
It's so rich.
Like you were talking about someone how

703
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:23,110
you,
your kid could catch gay by the way.

704
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:27,790
You Bang your wife but also,
but also now I'm getting,

705
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,110
I'm getting questioned who's dice?
Who's Andrew?

706
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,580
The liners.
We share the same foot cause I wear to

707
00:31:35,581 --> 00:31:37,630
fingerless gloves all the time.
So I go,

708
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:40,090
we share the same fucking closet.
What am I going to tell you?

709
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,430
I don't know how to separate the two for
you.

710
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,560
Like men,
they go crazy from that.

711
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,330
Yeah,
well they don't want to,

712
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,510
they don't want to allow that for some
reason.

713
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:54,280
Like there's also to weird art forms the
day allow people to act differently and

714
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,070
acting.
You become a character and then you're

715
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:58,300
who you are off stage.

716
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:03,550
But then in comedy for some reason they
want to combine the two always and

717
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:07,090
sometimes it is,
you know like some guys are exactly who

718
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,670
they are,
but like even now I'm self deprecated on

719
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:11,890
stage.
I talk about getting old or this and

720
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:13,030
that,
all that shit.

721
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,640
Right.
Years ago I never did any self

722
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:17,770
deprecating stuff.
You know what I mean?

723
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:21,610
It's just,
it just wasn't who dices dice was

724
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:24,010
supposed to be.
Just a comedic hero for people.

725
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:27,190
That's it.
And dice came out of your act where you

726
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:29,170
used to do a bunch of different
impressions.

727
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:30,540
Right.
All the impressions.

728
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,270
Fucking fantastic.
Stallone,

729
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,210
I don't know what you're talking about.
He's got like a great travolta,

730
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,300
Travolta Love Jake.
He got to work with them.

731
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,750
Yeah,
the Joey Guy,

732
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,750
when I saw him in grudge match and I was
like that's fucking great.

733
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:46,430
Worked with two of my heroes.

734
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,050
And you also do a mean ass travolta.
Who was,

735
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:54,200
that was one of the Guy Pachino and the
Eric.

736
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:54,651
Rob.
No,

737
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:56,360
Eric Roberts.
Eric Roberts.

738
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,640
Back when the,
when Eric Roberts was famous,

739
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,760
Charlie,
they took my fucking thumb child.

740
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:06,620
Sometimes you've got a whack him.
You say you put your coat on and you

741
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:07,860
don't say gun,
nighttime,

742
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,650
nobody
just village.

743
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:16,280
That's just to humble them.
That was a great fucking movie.

744
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,670
That was a great move to me and say they
don't cook.

745
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,760
The contents of my ball is on.
You can't believe you remember this.

746
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:27,570
And I'm driving by the comments.
Don't want to have to,

747
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:30,020
don't just look at just looking for a
free lunch.

748
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,310
See if maybe some of the sandwich out at
the comedy store and I'm rehearsing in

749
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:38,430
the original room to take,
I pull into the parking lot kind of bad.

750
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,190
I'm like wow,
these people here at one in the

751
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:42,980
afternoon,
this has to be 99

752
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:49,310
and I walk in and I hit a piano and I
look in that and that's like 20 old

753
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:54,290
people and Jeff is on stage playing and
diocese on and he's doing this fucking

754
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:59,291
thing cause I forgot the contents of my
balls is on your fairly tech like famous

755
00:34:01,191 --> 00:34:01,880
standards.

756
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,590
Oh my God.
How can the back

757
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,490
of my bowl?

758
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,900
You
can take my cock at of you

759
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:24,170
boxes too.
Good to be true.

760
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,720
Yeah.
Frankie Valli really liked that one.

761
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,380
Even asks me like,
why would you do that to my most famous?

762
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,630
And he did that go.
It's hysterical.

763
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,590
I love you.
You know,

764
00:34:38,591 --> 00:34:41,480
it could have been swearing to God,
but I want it like a ballad.

765
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,640
Don't you think that the blow back is
less ridiculous now though?

766
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,740
Oh No,
a hundred percent barretts by the shit

767
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:52,160
that saying about me with the acting.
See when you sit there and go,

768
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:53,480
you know when,
when when I,

769
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,020
when you came to know me,
I was filling out all those arenas and

770
00:34:57,021 --> 00:35:00,350
all that shit.
Like I take a lot of pride in that

771
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:05,030
because I know I set a standard for
comics that today when I see,

772
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,310
you know,
like Louis C k called me before he went

773
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:09,320
on at the forum,
you know,

774
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,420
nervous.

775
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:14,210
He can't blame the guy.
It's 18,000 people and I'm go on Louie.

776
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,720
You don't have to do anything other than
who they've come to love.

777
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,200
Don't exaggerate it.
You don't have to just be you.

778
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,960
You know,
because it's so many people,

779
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,510
you know.
But what I love is that,

780
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:30,440
that some of the guys have filled those
places now and I go,

781
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,690
it's core site.
I took the heat for it,

782
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,510
you know,
and I don't mind that history now.

783
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,390
I didn't mind it back then,
but I didn't realize the effect it would

784
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:42,930
have on the future of comics.
What was very important,

785
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,640
and it was overlooked by a lot of people
who were,

786
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:48,090
you know,
the talking about free speech all the

787
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:48,921
time.
I like what,

788
00:35:48,921 --> 00:35:50,970
what happened with you?
It was oh really overlooked because

789
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,700
there was,
it wasn't that what you were doing was

790
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:56,760
anything more crazy than anything that
was in the movies or anything that was

791
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:57,540
in literature.

792
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,880
Anything that was in books or magazines,
even,

793
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:00,810
you know,
articles,

794
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,910
what you were doing was just a really
extreme version of standup comedy.

795
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,110
I mean,
that's how I get done life.

796
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:12,270
That's when life really fun to watch.
And some people decided that your

797
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:15,360
character promoted,
you know,

798
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:19,930
in the most ridiculous ways,
promoted misogyny or a tray,

799
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,100
get hatred against gays.
And it wasn't,

800
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,670
and that's the funny,
it was just funny fucking jokes.

801
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,600
Right?
But how can,

802
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,670
and it was at a time,
you know,

803
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:31,760
cause I remember when Ellen came out of
the closet,

804
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,570
I love that girl.
You know what I mean?

805
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:38,310
I had nothing against gay people,
but at the time I was doing this act is

806
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:40,740
when they were fighting for their
rights,

807
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,750
when they want it to come at in the
closet,

808
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,440
you know?
But when I was at,

809
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,890
when I moved to Hollywood,
Eh,

810
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:47,400
yeah.

811
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,420
Not now.
You know,

812
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:49,950
like uh,
you know,

813
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:51,690
with uh,
what's his face?

814
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,950
Uh,
Caitlin Jenner.

815
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,120
Yeah.
Okay.

816
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,940
Now,
years ago when I would do a joke about

817
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:57,601
that,
you know,

818
00:36:57,601 --> 00:37:00,600
I would go and what's with these trans
testicles?

819
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,910
I go,
you meet the girly a dreams,

820
00:37:02,911 --> 00:37:04,970
right?
You'll wine are you Diana?

821
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,930
You take it home,
you put your hand up her skirt,

822
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:09,870
you're holding the tree trunk.
That's not hate.

823
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,970
It's funny,
you know?

824
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:16,500
And now today everything's changed.
So like when that happened with Caitlin

825
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,570
Niche,
she is doing a two hour interview about

826
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:19,404
it.
You know,

827
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,450
it's all accepted.
It's all good.

828
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:24,030
I don't care what anybody does,
you know,

829
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:28,460
but it's just like,
like I couldn't believe that backlash

830
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,800
because I'm going,
I say nothing about hating anybody.

831
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,240
Even with the sexist remark,
when they call him a sexist,

832
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,750
I,
it's not sexist.

833
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,870
I go,
I happen to love women and I love having

834
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:41,070
sex with women.

835
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:46,250
And I love making fun of how people make
such a big deal over sex.

836
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,570
I go,
that's all it's about.

837
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:52,560
So I like to paint these bigger than
life cartoon pictures,

838
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,710
uh,
of people having sex that they laugh at

839
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:59,760
themselves because we put so much on it,
you know,

840
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:01,920
just so much on the act,
uh,

841
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,800
of banging your chick,
you know,

842
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:07,620
and,
and it's the one moment in life when

843
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:10,630
everything in the world that goes on,
uh,

844
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,040
you know,
I'm sure you guys just said,

845
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,970
I just lose myself in that.
When,

846
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:19,971
when my balls a bashing into Hawaii,
I love for hours on end that my own wife

847
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:24,270
has to say,
I'm only a girl,

848
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,230
you know?
But it,

849
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:28,410
it,
it just take,

850
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:29,640
I'm kidding about that.
But,

851
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,510
but the point is,
it's like the one moment in your life,

852
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,220
you know when you're blowing it out from
the bottom of your,

853
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,700
not big for more the pressure you might
have gone to that day.

854
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:47,680
You forget the world for those moments.
The greatest feeling ever.

855
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,960
If I could laugh hysterically and
becoming at the same time,

856
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,420
I could die at that moment and I'll be
happy to two greatest things ever to

857
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:02,410
laugh as hard as you can from like
something a best buddy would tell you

858
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:04,810
that you can't control to kind of laugh
where you go.

859
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:07,540
You got to stop.
I can't breathe and you're blowing your

860
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:10,000
load.
I could take death at that time.

861
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,930
All good.
That's a good way to go.

862
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,540
Yeah,
but how do you get the laugh gone?

863
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:19,480
Because we topics don't make you laugh
and calm at the same time.

864
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,250
You have to play a prank on her and then
you'd have to fight off guilt to really

865
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:27,360
enjoy prank on your chick.
She looks at you the same prank I do to

866
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:29,020
you that you might laugh hysterical.

867
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,300
She'll go,
why did you say that?

868
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,590
Okay.
All right,

869
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,410
let's go to the mall.
Ari and I were talking about that

870
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:39,250
yesterday about a comics and saying do
the meanest fucking shit to each other

871
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,600
and it's hilarious.
We were talking about guys knocking,

872
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,960
Ari knocked a pill bottle out of some
dude's hand.

873
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,850
Synthol is mince flying but there was
some I guess volumes that what it was or

874
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,030
out towards 10 and there was like a
vicodin or something in it.

875
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,710
Something like that.
But that's like that's typical comic

876
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:58,630
shit.
Right Joe,

877
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:02,560
you've been with the second girl for a
long time though as I feel.

878
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,580
Have you seen little joey?
Yeah,

879
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:08,000
completely daughters.
His daughter's adorable complaints.

880
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,900
It's,
we started talking a few months ago,

881
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:13,030
I wanted him to play this bouncer and
uh,

882
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,670
and still rebels first video,
you know,

883
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:17,860
but he was,
he was out of town so we couldn't use

884
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:18,694
them obviously.

885
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,000
Are you,
why are you having more fun now than

886
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:24,280
you've had before?
Thousand percent.

887
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:25,240
It's lighter.
Yeah.

888
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:28,570
You seem like you seem real relaxed.
Like,

889
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:30,360
even when everything was going great for
you,

890
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:31,880
it was,
you were,

891
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,060
you were real stressed,
but you seem like,

892
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,530
cause she had,
I had the whole,

893
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:37,660
I was under a microscope.
That's what it was.

894
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,450
And you would one of the only guys that,
that was it.

895
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,900
There was Kennison and kiss and died and
then you were still alive.

896
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:46,210
And you were the guy that people would
get mad at.

897
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,610
And I remember when Kurt Loder was mad
at,

898
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:51,790
you remember that shit the fuck,
what was that?

899
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,280
Wasn't he mad at you?
Everybody was mad.

900
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:57,550
Did you do get banned from MTV for town?
Some jokes about feminine hygiene

901
00:40:57,551 --> 00:41:02,551
products and what happened if you want
the little MTV story that they keep

902
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:03,820
throwing at me.

903
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,770
Also,
what happened was I was booked or

904
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:10,960
scenario was the host and I was booked
to bring out share,

905
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:11,950
which,
uh,

906
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,700
which,
uh,

907
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,940
which I looked at like that's cause I,
I'm a chef fan.

908
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,110
Uh,
she,

909
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,620
she was coming to my show,
she came to the Wilton,

910
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,550
the amphitheater,
the La Forum,

911
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,190
you know,
so when they asked me to bring her out,

912
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,240
it was like,
that's great,

913
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,280
you know,
MTV awards.

914
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:31,600
So now a couple minutes before I go out,
uh,

915
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,570
Dick Clark calls me over backstage and
he goes,

916
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:38,810
look,
you might have to stretch a little

917
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:40,880
because she is getting dressed.
And I'm like,

918
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,040
what do you mean she's getting dressed?
She was nothing.

919
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:47,600
She wears a thong in some nylons.
That's the outfit,

920
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,670
you know?
And he goes,

921
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:51,050
well,
if you've got to stretch,

922
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:55,160
Arcenio will come over and you'll do
something.

923
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,611
I go,
no,

924
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:55,850
no,
no,

925
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:56,330
no,
no.

926
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,760
That's not how it works with me.
I go,

927
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,200
I've been watching this whole show.
I saw Richard Lewis come on and just

928
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:05,300
freaking eat it.
You know,

929
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:09,890
pull rise and try to come out and talk
about this to an MTV audience,

930
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,470
you know,
6,000 people at the amphitheater

931
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,760
polarizers talking about the hats that
Frank Sinatra,

932
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:20,300
whereas crickets,
you know,

933
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,590
and my friend,
uh,

934
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,370
I,
my friend,

935
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:27,110
hot tub,
Johnny says to me,

936
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,100
he goes,
look,

937
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,900
you could go out there,
you could be a tear drop or you could be

938
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:35,010
a title wave.
He goes,

939
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,520
look what this guy's telling you,
you're going to stretch.

940
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,220
So now,
cause he took me on the side and as he

941
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:42,800
takes me on the side,
if the Dick Clark talks to me,

942
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,830
they started introducing me.
So I'm angry.

943
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,100
So I come out and I just go into my act.
I do,

944
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:49,910
uh,
uh,

945
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:54,200
the poem was
the famous poem.

946
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:59,680
I think
Georgie porgie putting in pipe jerked

947
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:03,350
off in his girlfriends.
I went awry was giant shut.

948
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,160
Georgie fucked at one eit slut.
Oh,

949
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,250
you know,
so that was like the poem I did,

950
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,060
you know,
and then I was talking about they kill,

951
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:15,523
yeah.
Killed,

952
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,610
you know,
my manager at the time,

953
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:21,770
Sandy Gowan,
if after,

954
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,580
after I came off stage,
they have all these tents with press and

955
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:30,581
they took me from each tent and not one
question was asked to me,

956
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,460
but I got press for two years after
that.

957
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,890
I mean every day and the arena shows,
if I was doing one arena show,

958
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:42,500
let's say a milwaukee that with three
now,

959
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,540
you know,
so it's doing,

960
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,780
you know,
60,000 people for the weekend rather

961
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:52,550
than 20 it Wa it was,
I did all the 12 million people in a,

962
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:57,500
in a four year span in arenas.
And when that man,

963
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,360
yeah,
when it got bad,

964
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,670
I was doing 10,000 people a night.

965
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,360
So you know,
this is after they crushed Ford fairlane

966
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,700
you know,
and I'd be walking around New Orleans

967
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:12,020
with my father and he'd go,
you're supposed to be done and you're

968
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:14,510
doing 20,000 people at the Sun.
Don't tonight.

969
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,730
What is wrong with Hollywood?
You know,

970
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:20,630
it was just insanity for many years.
They just decided that they were going

971
00:44:20,631 --> 00:44:21,351
to black.
That was,

972
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:23,930
it puts you on the outs.
And I remember watching it going,

973
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,740
this is kind of fucking creepy.
It's Kinda creepy that they all just

974
00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:32,030
decide that this isn't a valid art form.
That the kind of shit makes me how

975
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,060
laughing.
Look,

976
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:35,880
if you really meant what you said,
you really were a bad guy.

977
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,780
It wouldn't be that funny.
It's funny because I know I'm a good

978
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:40,060
guy.
Yeah,

979
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:40,893
it's,
and it's,

980
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,520
that's why I had this little argument
with this interview because Fd saw me in

981
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:44,970
Vegas.

982
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,900
The guy was telling you a few weeks ago,
first he interviewed me in La,

983
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,990
so he got to meet Max.
He got to meet Dylan.

984
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:54,240
And I know you guys know them and the
kind of guys,

985
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:55,380
they all,
they're great.

986
00:44:55,381 --> 00:44:59,550
Can I actually say that?
The two nicest guys I've ever hung with

987
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:00,960
in my life,
so well adjusted,

988
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,330
not talking about the rock band when
they're on stage,

989
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,850
they all who they are,
they're rock stars on stage.

990
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,550
That's who they are.
But when they're on stage,

991
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,680
they're the most respectful,
funny,

992
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,610
nicest guys I've ever hung with.
Not even as sons,

993
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:19,470
just as guys.
Cause they're both men now 21 and 25 and

994
00:45:19,471 --> 00:45:22,110
to hang with them,
it's like a privilege to me because

995
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,730
they're just great guys that could hang.
They can talk to me about any fucking

996
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:27,564
thing.
Dicey.

997
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:28,630
And Your Dad?
No,

998
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,310
but,
but,

999
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,630
but that's the beauty of them.

1000
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,970
They know they could come to me with
anything.

1001
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:36,510
Of course there was a,
they just recorded that first full

1002
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:37,680
album.
Okay.

1003
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,620
So there's one song called I got to
have,

1004
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,580
and I call that the sec song because
it's all sexual.

1005
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,510
All the words is sexual.
And Dylan writes all the songs.

1006
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,700
So the night before he's going to record
it,

1007
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,740
he comes over to me in the backyard,
was smoking a,

1008
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,310
a blonde,
you know,

1009
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,660
and he says,
dad,

1010
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,330
did you ever really hear the words too?
I got to have,

1011
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,590
cause we're gonna record it tomorrow.
I go,

1012
00:46:02,591 --> 00:46:04,740
well,
in the clubs it's hard to pick it all up

1013
00:46:04,741 --> 00:46:06,510
because of the sound systems,
you know.

1014
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,840
So he does the words and it's all sex.
And I go,

1015
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,480
it's a perfect,
couldn't be better.

1016
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,230
I go and what's beautiful about it?
It's not filthy,

1017
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,250
it's just sexual.
And that's a great thing coming from a

1018
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:23,460
21 year old because what should you be
talking about?

1019
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:24,840
Right.
You know what I mean?

1020
00:46:24,841 --> 00:46:25,970
Until you know about,
so,

1021
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,380
but I'm saying this guy,
I got to meet my son's,

1022
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:30,690
hang with my son's,
hang with Valerie,

1023
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:33,450
hang with the eleanor,
you know,

1024
00:46:33,451 --> 00:46:37,500
so he got to talk to me.
Just one on one is a human being and

1025
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:39,660
then fdcs me on stage in Vegas.
It's like,

1026
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:41,610
why would you do that?
Now,

1027
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:43,680
who's dice?
Who's Angela Eggo?

1028
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:44,970
I been,
I been,

1029
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,060
I'm sorry I ever took that name on,
you know,

1030
00:46:48,061 --> 00:46:51,780
because it's like,
it's the same guy I am from Brooklyn.

1031
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,560
I do have an attitude.
I do smoke cigarettes,

1032
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,170
you know,
but I don't walk around my house,

1033
00:46:58,171 --> 00:46:58,831
you know,
a Grandpa,

1034
00:46:58,831 --> 00:47:02,340
my dick go
take that.

1035
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,260
You know,
it's a joke.

1036
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:07,210
It's all a fucking joke.
It's,

1037
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,040
I don't want to get mad.
It's too early on the day.

1038
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,380
I don't get real mad,
you know?

1039
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,760
But you know the TV show now dice,
it's,

1040
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:19,020
it is a hybrid.
You get to see different sides of of who

1041
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:19,980
I am.
So they,

1042
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:23,130
but they tried to say now,
now that you're doing these big movies

1043
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,310
and you're doing tv shows,
like you're on that vinyl show too,

1044
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:28,660
right?
You get all these legit acting gigs and

1045
00:47:28,661 --> 00:47:31,180
these legit acting gigs.
They're thinking,

1046
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,990
why would you go back to what you do
best and what everybody loves you from?

1047
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,770
Because I never stopped doing how,
but think about how crazy that is it

1048
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,860
people who love you for this and Robin
Williams,

1049
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:44,290
continuous standup career.
Then Richard Pryor,

1050
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:47,140
continuous standup Korea took a long
time off,

1051
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,310
but even Eddie Murphy did the stand up
till till whatever happened to it.

1052
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:53,440
But even when he started doing the big
movies,

1053
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:56,080
he was still doing concert films as
stand up.

1054
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:59,110
What's wrong with and doing your first
love?

1055
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,070
Well,
not only that,

1056
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:04,030
what's wrong with doing it when you know
that's what people want to see it.

1057
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,440
It's just bizarre that I load doing it.
They would decide that this is the movie

1058
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:10,150
things more legit.
You know?

1059
00:48:10,151 --> 00:48:12,010
It's like what everybody's really going
for.

1060
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,040
Well,
you know,

1061
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,250
I'm a movie star.
I love acting.

1062
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:18,250
I've always loved acting.
That's why I even got on stage as a

1063
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:22,180
comic because I didn't want to go to
acting school once a week.

1064
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:26,110
I want it every day training.
So I put together the act that you

1065
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:31,111
brought up earlier with Jerry Lewis into
Travolta and I took that all the way up

1066
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:36,361
to doing Don Kirshner is rock concert.
And after that I was thinking,

1067
00:48:36,821 --> 00:48:40,000
well you know,
at that time a lot of directors would

1068
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:42,310
come in to the comedy store.
As a matter of fact,

1069
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,460
uh,
the first movie I didn't get but I got

1070
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:48,370
close to was the movie diner.

1071
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,920
You know,
that Barry Levinson directed.

1072
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,420
And he saw me at that.
But now I was on stage being dicey.

1073
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,900
So this guy flies me to New York.
He puts me in a school to learn the

1074
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:07,651
Boston accent with a teacher and I was
killing with the pot and I obviously I

1075
00:49:09,731 --> 00:49:14,200
didn't get it in the end,
but that's why beyond at the comedy

1076
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,900
store,
cause I just wanted to hone acting

1077
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:19,180
chops.
And then I finally did get,

1078
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,430
you know,
Michael Mann when he did crime story,

1079
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,730
which was thrilling to me,
you know,

1080
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,400
to be in a show with guys,
Kevin Spacey,

1081
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:30,250
David Caruso.
Um,

1082
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,060
you were fucking great crime story in
your mouth,

1083
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,170
piece of Gum.
Why we threw another one and not

1084
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,920
the one on one.
You got to loosen up the stress.

1085
00:49:41,921 --> 00:49:43,230
You gotta pop another stock.
They,

1086
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,030
the actors that were on that show,
you know,

1087
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:47,590
that was Dennis Farina.

1088
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:50,260
That was Tony Denison.
But you know,

1089
00:49:50,261 --> 00:49:54,100
when you're working with guys like Kevin
Spacey who was already starting to get

1090
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:58,240
known and you know,
just everybody was Michael Madsen,

1091
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,220
you know,
just Ted Levine,

1092
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,550
you know that.
Well,

1093
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,920
the Buffalo Bill,
you know,

1094
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:05,170
he's done a million movies,
but the most famous is,

1095
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:06,004
you know,
uh,

1096
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,940
clarice,
whatever the fuck it,

1097
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:13,390
I'm told me that story about how you got
crime story and that's everything I do

1098
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:17,200
on an audition now where the camera was
rolling.

1099
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,270
Yeah.
They called you while you were rascals

1100
00:50:19,271 --> 00:50:21,360
and told you you got it.
Got It.

1101
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,500
What happened is,
I got it five months later.

1102
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:25,660
What happened?
I went to read for Bonnie Timmermann,

1103
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,100
you know,
and I figured Michael Mann would be

1104
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:29,210
there,
you know,

1105
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:30,440
like you know,
watching,

1106
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:32,390
but he's not there and she's just
filming it.

1107
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:36,310
So I get mad at Michael.
So I start talking into the camera cause

1108
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,480
I was reading for the gangsters,
right?

1109
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,170
Yeah.
And I'm like,

1110
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,250
oh,
so you're a tough guy.

1111
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:42,320
You don't have to show up for fucking
audition.

1112
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,530
What's your problem?
I'm not big enough for you to sit in an

1113
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:47,510
office and watch.
Okay.

1114
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:50,000
So after three days and not hearing
anything,

1115
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:50,561
he figured,
all right,

1116
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:55,490
I didn't get this part.
Five months later I was visiting in New

1117
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:59,450
York and my mother's waking me up going,
you raging called three times already

1118
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:01,250
from William monitors.
So you've got to call back.

1119
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,600
You know,
it's like call her up and I'm having

1120
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:07,970
coffee with my mother,
but what I'm hearing in the phone,

1121
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:11,750
I like can't believe she goes,
you got booked on the show.

1122
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:14,030
Crime story,
five seasons,

1123
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,000
you know,
and this is what the pay is.

1124
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:21,330
I think the pace started me at like
2,500 and episode guaranteed seven at a

1125
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:24,530
13 abc,
you know,

1126
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:26,780
and I'm gone and I'm looking at my much
everything,

1127
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:27,260
right.

1128
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,370
You know,
is everything okay?

1129
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,020
And I hang up,
I go,

1130
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:33,710
I just got to a TV series.
I got to go to Chicago Sunday night,

1131
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,960
NBC.
Oh,

1132
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,160
was it all right,
I'm from Miami,

1133
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,000
I'm a fucking vice.
Are you kidding me?

1134
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:42,020
Who does that was not so,
so it was paying off the acting,

1135
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,710
you know?
And then I did the movie casual sex near

1136
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,890
the end of that,
and then the Rodney Special Ed and that

1137
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:52,370
was it.
I still remember Joe Rogan being in the

1138
00:51:52,371 --> 00:51:55,580
motherfucking halfway house and I had
furloughs

1139
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:02,620
and they said to me,
the new rule is you can't go out on New

1140
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,460
Year's Eve.
He would if you have furloughs.

1141
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,820
So they had conference rooms at the
halfway house.

1142
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,220
And I said,
let me ask you guys a question.

1143
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,040
What can I do on the conference from New
Jersey?

1144
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:14,413
And they said,
nothing.

1145
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,920
I go,
what if I fucking rent it?

1146
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,700
You can rent it.
What do you want to offer?

1147
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:22,070
A second or 100 bucks.
I want the air conditioner on all

1148
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:25,340
fucking night
cause they always turn the air

1149
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:27,920
conditioner off.
I fucking put the air on.

1150
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,200
I brought,
there was a TV in there and I rented a

1151
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,820
VCR and I told all the inmates,
I go,

1152
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:37,430
what do you guys want to do is sit in
your fucking room so he could watch this

1153
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:39,710
comedian Andrew dice.
Then nobody knew who he was.

1154
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,160
Nobody knew who he was.
And that threw the fucking,

1155
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:44,960
uh,
vhs.

1156
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:46,220
And,
and I,

1157
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:49,970
that's what I did for New Year's Eve.
And at that moment I knew I got to do

1158
00:52:49,971 --> 00:52:50,870
this.
Yeah.

1159
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,010
He said,
told me when,

1160
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,510
he said,
when I first met you,

1161
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:55,340
would you like to buy a flower for the
lady?

1162
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:56,151
And he goes,
yeah,

1163
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:59,810
so I could plant it in your ass.
I was crying,

1164
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:04,250
not from funny.
I was crying because I had those

1165
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:06,470
thoughts.
This was the boys that was living in my

1166
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:09,290
head when I walked around and I saw
somebody and people are like,

1167
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:10,560
oh,
look at that lady's dress.

1168
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,970
And I'm like,
she's a fucking dirty fucking content.

1169
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,340
You know what I'm saying?
But that's the voice I had in my head.

1170
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:20,450
So when I watched dice,
he says,

1171
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:24,230
it's a beautiful poetic thing.
[inaudible]

1172
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:27,420
you have voice will have my daughter.
She's fucking idea the voices.

1173
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,060
I was living in boulder amongst
gentiles,

1174
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,850
which slippers that thought the world
was beautiful.

1175
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:36,060
And I'm in the back of my head.
I had this inner voice that would always

1176
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:40,380
look at people and judge and go,
look at this fucking Jamoke fucking

1177
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:42,450
birken socks.
I bet his wife,

1178
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:46,140
his wife's a Vegan [inaudible] often a
pussy when it begins,

1179
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:50,690
the Ph just smells like a carrot,
like fucking grass.

1180
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,850
Cause they're vegans.
The Ph is off.

1181
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,350
So I was sitting there and since I would
say all of these dirty things in my

1182
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:00,870
mind,
so the first time I saw you at that

1183
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:03,090
halfway house,
I know I got to do this,

1184
00:54:03,091 --> 00:54:06,330
try it.
Because this guy he's doing me,

1185
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,570
this guy's doing the guy that's living
in my head.

1186
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:13,920
This was who he was.
To know that thing about coming to know

1187
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:15,710
about all the inmates around the
country.

1188
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,600
Well,
if there's more inmates like Joey,

1189
00:54:18,601 --> 00:54:20,410
we just got to figure out how to get
them out common.

1190
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,260
Where,
I remember when I met Joey and he goes,

1191
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,990
you know the back steps like,
oh he goes,

1192
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,450
I'm here cause see you.
That's why I'm doing this.

1193
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,210
That's a compliment to me.
You know?

1194
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:32,160
It's like wow.
Yeah,

1195
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,790
all bullshit aside.
You were at the front of the line for

1196
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:38,150
free speech for Comedians.
You know Pete,

1197
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,470
they can,
people can decide whatever.

1198
00:54:40,471 --> 00:54:42,450
They know it's offensive or no,
it's this.

1199
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:45,540
No it's not.
At the end of the day it's a kind of art

1200
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,600
and you might not like it,
but I'm not asking you to go listen to

1201
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:50,380
gangster rap either.
You listen,

1202
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:51,930
whatever the fuck you want to listen to
God.

1203
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:54,810
I'm not saying you should go see Ya,
a mob movie and watch a hundred people

1204
00:54:54,811 --> 00:54:56,790
get shot up,
but if you want to do that,

1205
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,950
you should be allowed to do that and
somebody should be allowed to make them,

1206
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,083
you know?

1207
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:05,780
Well,
I've been getting a lot of cool people

1208
00:55:05,781 --> 00:55:07,880
coming to see me lately.
Eh,

1209
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:09,080
in,
in Vegas.

1210
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,440
I mean it's like people,
I look up to that I liked that music

1211
00:55:12,441 --> 00:55:15,540
like have come way around.
Like this past weekend,

1212
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:20,560
pit bull came with his whole,
his whole show for 20 people to shop.

1213
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:25,100
And this guy sitting at Tommy dice,
he goes,

1214
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:30,190
I was watching you before you made it.
Cause I did like certain tapes that were

1215
00:55:30,621 --> 00:55:32,330
out there,
like a with Redd Foxx.

1216
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,320
And he goes,
I was watching you.

1217
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:37,790
And he knew when in 87 and Rodney wasn't
till 88.

1218
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:40,070
He goes,
I saw you like before that,

1219
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,410
you know.
So when they told me last night that

1220
00:55:42,411 --> 00:55:45,410
taken me to see you and this is what
they call him,

1221
00:55:45,411 --> 00:55:46,650
Mr Worldwide.
He's on,

1222
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,493
you know,
this guy,

1223
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,290
you know,
and like,

1224
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:50,940
it blows my mind,
like the,

1225
00:55:50,941 --> 00:55:54,710
the kind of people that he was seven
years old watching me,

1226
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:56,990
you know,
that's like crazy shit.

1227
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,310
Um,
uh,

1228
00:55:58,311 --> 00:56:02,420
Bruno Mars a few weeks ago.
I mean that's like a not and these are

1229
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:04,880
people I look up to that I loved that
work.

1230
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,420
You know how many seats is that place?
The laugh factor in Vegas.

1231
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,250
Oh it's small.
It's three 40 and now you know,

1232
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:15,860
I'll come back there in April and then
in May that that putting me in the big

1233
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,370
showroom but I,
I told Harry Bazell I said,

1234
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,770
you know,
I'll go on the big show room for that

1235
00:56:21,771 --> 00:56:22,604
night.
I don't care.

1236
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:28,320
I'd rather work three nights for the
same money in the small room that they

1237
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:33,610
can get more money in the big room.
I go because I love being on top of the

1238
00:56:33,611 --> 00:56:34,630
people.
I'm not out.

1239
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,380
I mean there were certain big things
that that are not coming my way.

1240
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:43,381
There is talk about going into the
garden in September again because I sort

1241
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:46,600
of owe that to myself and the fans,
you know,

1242
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:49,420
because things have built to this
crescendo again.

1243
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,070
So it's like why not?
And plus my sons could be there and see

1244
00:56:54,071 --> 00:56:57,940
it all come down.
And that's thrilling for me because my

1245
00:56:57,941 --> 00:57:00,070
field,
the reason they're doing really well now

1246
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:03,970
is because I teach them by example how
to go after something.

1247
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,490
And about eight years ago when I had to
start gambling again just to pay my

1248
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:11,260
mortgage,
you know,

1249
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,070
I would tell my sons going to start
gambling to pay your mortgage.

1250
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,470
Yeah.
Because I just wasn't making enough

1251
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:19,120
money and the gigs,
you know,

1252
00:57:19,121 --> 00:57:24,121
so I quit gambling for 10 years and
gambling a blackjack or you just really

1253
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:25,360
good.
All right,

1254
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,270
well I had 30 grand.
Long Story Short,

1255
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,510
I turned it into 1,000,001 50 in a
couple days.

1256
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,270
Okay.
And I only play alone.

1257
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:38,170
That's how I play blackjack.
And you know,

1258
00:57:38,171 --> 00:57:40,360
I was nice enough to give a lot of it
back,

1259
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:41,860
you know,
over time.

1260
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,810
And,
but that's what gambling is.

1261
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,280
But through these last few years of
building up again,

1262
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,840
you know,
trust me,

1263
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,550
woody Allen didn't go,
I want,

1264
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,830
I want you in my movie,
here's a couple million dollars.

1265
00:57:53,831 --> 00:57:55,870
It doesn't work like that,
you know?

1266
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,760
But it was an honor to do a movie for
him.

1267
00:57:57,761 --> 00:58:02,761
So I still had to do to gambling and I
ended the gambling with getting all the

1268
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:08,380
money for them to record their album
because,

1269
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,300
you know,
it's still not ridiculous.

1270
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:12,370
Vegas,
I'm paying back taxes,

1271
00:58:12,371 --> 00:58:15,900
I'm taking care of things that take a
few years to take care of.

1272
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:19,030
But I also knew rock and roll was
coming,

1273
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:19,701
you know,
wood,

1274
00:58:19,701 --> 00:58:24,701
vinyl and roadies and guns and roses
back together and now jethro tall and

1275
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,850
all these great rock bands are coming
back.

1276
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:32,851
So I wanted my boys prepared.
So I gambled until I got every dime I

1277
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:35,980
needed for them to record.

1278
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:39,820
Like I would call dillon from Vegas and
go book another week in the studio.

1279
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:41,710
It's handled,
you know,

1280
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:43,300
and then I stopped,
you know,

1281
00:58:43,301 --> 00:58:46,210
just done.
You know how I am now.

1282
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:48,670
I am doing well again.
I'm doing concert tours.

1283
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:50,590
It's happening now.
How long did you in before?

1284
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,210
Um,
well,

1285
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,880
uh,
this last run was about eight years.

1286
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:56,720
That is hilarious.
So you,

1287
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,720
but you did it profitable?
Yeah,

1288
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,410
I would lose like any gambling,
see my,

1289
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,470
and they show gambling in dice the show,
you know,

1290
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,000
cause it's a hybrid of my life.
But,

1291
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:09,280
but the,
you use that as a strategy to figure out

1292
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:10,540
how to make money.
That's hilarious.

1293
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,910
You know what,
you know when my back's against the

1294
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:13,990
wall,
look at him over there.

1295
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,810
When my back is against the wall,
you know,

1296
00:59:16,811 --> 00:59:19,450
the bottom line is I'm always going to
take care of my family.

1297
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:22,520
That's the way it is.
And I do what I have to do,

1298
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,740
you know,
to handle those things,

1299
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,600
you know?
So I mean,

1300
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,300
you know,
Bruce over here would say,

1301
00:59:28,301 --> 00:59:29,740
I don't gamble this,
that,

1302
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,220
you know,
but you know,

1303
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,151
we,
you know,

1304
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,970
I've helped him out.
I help everybody out that needed the

1305
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:37,490
help when we needed it and now we're
doing good.

1306
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:41,720
So I just stopped.
That's just a crazy thing to plan on,

1307
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,910
to like to try to make money by
gambling.

1308
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:46,260
You know,
the bottom line is when you sit down to,

1309
00:59:46,261 --> 00:59:46,971
again,
number one,

1310
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:49,790
I only play alone with a,
with a dealer,

1311
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,160
and you only play blackjack and only
black jazzes,

1312
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,190
you and the dealer.
That's it.

1313
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,480
Whatever you put up in front of you,
the only way to win.

1314
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:02,180
Did you gotta be willing to lose every
penny in front of you with no fear to

1315
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:03,254
beat them.

1316
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:08,560
And a lot of the times I won and a lot
of times I'd walk outlet,

1317
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,580
not winning,
but it,

1318
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,250
it's nothing I recommend,
you know,

1319
01:00:13,251 --> 01:00:16,160
just like a performer,
I had a certain feel for it,

1320
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,451
you know,
I mean,

1321
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:19,550
I could walk into a casino,
you know,

1322
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,500
I mean years ago I'd play,
you know,

1323
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,690
half a million at a clip.
You know,

1324
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:27,950
that was years ago when I was doing like
the arena shows and that was just like a

1325
01:00:27,951 --> 01:00:30,290
half million dollars a night.
I could win or lose a half,

1326
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:32,640
a million and a half hour,
you know,

1327
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:37,670
that was a day I lost a half a million
by noon and by five in the afternoon,

1328
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:41,210
I want it all back.
Plus another 55,000 oh my.

1329
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:45,170
It was plays like that,
but now it was more about win 10 grand,

1330
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,560
which to me is pretty simple to do,
you know,

1331
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:52,010
because I'm so used to playing gigantic
figures from years ago.

1332
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:56,150
So if I lose,
if I sit down at a table with five grand

1333
01:00:56,151 --> 01:01:00,230
and I'm down 2,500,
I'm not going to sweat that because I

1334
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:02,540
know I could get that back in 30
seconds.

1335
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,610
You know,
most of the time I would,

1336
