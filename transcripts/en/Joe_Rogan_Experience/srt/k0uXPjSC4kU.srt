1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,810
Five,
four,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,100
three,
two,

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,100
bill,
burr and live.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,790
You look very slick.
He looked like a professional man.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,310
Like I was doing television this 
morning.

6
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:15,300
As I mentioned to you,
I,

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,350
I just had Colin cowherd show and I run 
out of button down shirts I could wear 

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,400
on tv because I was go button down and 
jeans and whatever.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,420
Nice pair of shoes.
I'm not a sport coat guy,

10
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:29,000
but I was just like.
I had to go back and Google image myself

11
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:30,880
on the Shogun.
What did I wear last time I,

12
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:32,480
I couldn't tell what black shirt I had 
on.

13
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:33,180
It's like,
Oh God,

14
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:36,030
I gotta throw a sport coat on so I'm 
show get trust for that.

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,660
Like what do you all Hollywood now man.
Trying to look good.

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,320
So yeah,
that's why I'm dressed up here on the 

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,650
best dressed man in podcasting today.
You are right now for sure.

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,710
At this moment.
I am amazed that you actually look to 

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,560
check to see if you were wearing the 
same shirt.

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:53,860
Yeah.

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,750
What do you do that for yourself?
You do that because the Internet is 

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:00,750
just.
The Internet is nonstop shit.

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,770
It's like,
why help them out?

24
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,030
I mean,
it's like if you're going to trash me,

25
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,950
that's,
I'm going to make your work for it.

26
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:07,710
I'm not going to give you the lay up.
It's such a mild trashing.

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,000
I mean,
it's coming from me.

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,500
I dress like a fucking idiot and it 
just,

29
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,430
you know,
it just,

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,360
it's just,
is what it is.

31
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:16,950
It's just like,
for whatever reason,

32
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,510
I mean,
I don't know.

33
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:21,360
I get a kick out of doing stuff like 
that.

34
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:26,361
Like Ah,
which way they're going to come at me 

35
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:26,361
today.
Just make them make them better at it.

36
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:27,240
Oh,
I said the you bald headed blah,

37
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:28,680
blah,
blah second every fucking day.

38
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:33,681
It's so.
But to get somebody to come at you in a 

39
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:34,350
thank you,
to get you in a unique way.

40
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,230
Um,
if they get me in a unique way,

41
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,660
it actually makes me laugh and then 
there's entertainment for me,

42
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:42,680
but if it's the same old tired shit,
I dunno,

43
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,100
they get me lately for my socks.
I didn't know that you,

44
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:49,470
you're not supposed to have socks that 
kind of cover your ankles.

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Like these are acceptable.
These socks are acceptable sucks either 

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,490
because they're women's socks.
When we were kids and they had a little 

47
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,630
ball on rabbit tail on the end,
they looked there with Chris evertts.

48
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,980
What happened?
Remember,

49
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:06,981
you should have calf high socks.
Those were the shit catfights socks and 

50
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:07,590
you've shorts barely covered your junk.

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Exactly.
Now everybody's shorts go down on their 

52
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:15,500
knees and their socks are nonexistent 
now,

53
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,340
but the short to coming back up and I 
don't like that.

54
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,410
You know,
like I know there's a,

55
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,410
there's,
there's been a lot of that and then they

56
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:27,411
said that's the anti man man who's so 
comfortable with his masculinity and 

57
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:31,900
those hips to Douche bag.
So they like literally wearing like the 

58
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:31,900
old running shorts with the slit going 
up the side,

59
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,450
like Macho Comacho.
Really?

60
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,460
Oh yeah.
Who the fuck's wearing those?

61
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,830
Not a bunch,
but I've just seen enough and you just 

62
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,071
look at the whole thing.
It's like they literally look like 

63
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:43,140
they're going to go do some Ron Burgundy
sketch or something,

64
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:44,970
but it's how they walk around and they 
act like,

65
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:47,070
oh no,
just I liked these shorts.

66
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,580
I put a picture of my sneakers and my 
socks on instagram the other day,

67
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:52,050
which is not a smart move anyway.

68
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,050
Like why did I even do that?
I just went running for three miles in 

69
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,471
my sneakers and socks recover with dirt,
but the amount of people to shed a my 

70
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,750
socks.
It's like,

71
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,910
what's wrong?
What's wrong with it?

72
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,040
If they covered it rankles that's it.
That what's wrong with those socks?

73
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,260
I don't know,
but I don't know,

74
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:10,010
but there is something wrong with them.
I,

75
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:11,500
you know,
I can't put my finger on it.

76
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,810
That ribbon around the ribbed for her 
pleasure at the top and then like your 

77
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:21,030
sneakers to the,
you know,

78
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,110
if you're going to go run and dirt.
Like those are the ones that do it.

79
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,630
They look very artsy though.
That looks like some shit.

80
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:27,760
My wife would appreciate if it was on a 
canvas,

81
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,120
you know the socks,
no design on your sneakers,

82
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,810
you know,
modern art thing.

83
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,950
The lines go this way and then they go 
that way much like life and then they 

84
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:40,950
intersect,
you know,

85
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,250
that type of shit and it's just like,
why don't you just draw a house?

86
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,760
Do you ever go to Lacma?
The La County Museum don't go,

87
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:47,050
you'll go crazy now.
I,

88
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:47,770
I,
I,

89
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,960
I don't,
I,

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,890
you know,
I think the most important I would enjoy

91
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:53,080
the tram ride up.
Like this is fun.

92
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,120
This is cool part.
Yeah.

93
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:02,620
There's a lot of szekely dress.
Older women with like ridiculously weird

94
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,520
glasses.
Like the,

95
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,100
the color of the frames is always some,
you know,

96
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:07,390
some statements,
you know what I mean?

97
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:11,030
Some splash of color to let you know 
that they have a personality or maybe on

98
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:12,880
this usage,
I'm probably just intimidated.

99
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,520
No,
you're not intimidated.

100
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,120
It's nonsense.
I went there and there.

101
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,080
I mean we've talked about this before,
but there's a,

102
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,400
there was a box,
like a plexiglass box on the ground.

103
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,460
That's it.
And amber plexiglass box and I thought 

104
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,521
it was like some sort of a like maybe a 
stand and then like the exhibit's going 

105
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:29,521
in.

106
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:29,521
Nope.
Nope,

107
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:30,850
nope.
The box was the art.

108
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,020
That's it,
right?

109
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,910
Nothing in it.
Every art form has that.

110
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,040
Every art form has their plastic box 
like,

111
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,940
no,
this is standup.

112
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,510
There it is.
Right.

113
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,400
This is a standup comedy special.
Oh,

114
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,410
well,
it's kind of amber.

115
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:43,690
A little bit like a.
I Mean I get this delight I guess,

116
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:45,850
but it's just a fucking box.
I mean it looks like something you would

117
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:48,610
go get it a crate and barrel.
I could build that.

118
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,850
You easily can build that.
You've given me some glue and you gave 

119
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:53,850
me the pieces.
It's probably worth 30 grand.

120
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,110
I know and it's just like.
I would literally put my feet on that in

121
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:03,111
a second.
You should do you know you got this 

122
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:03,111
booklet for me here,
dear reader.

123
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:06,741
Kim Jong Il.
He looks like the kind of person you'd 

124
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:06,741
run into in a museum if he had like sexy
or glasses,

125
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,590
that lunatic will probably somehow hear 
this and actually go out and get some.

126
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,800
You know that he's skimmed off a dog.
He's dead.

127
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,480
That's not his son.
No,

128
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,280
that's the dad.
What's his son's name?

129
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,250
Kim Jong wound.

130
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,080
Oh,

131
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,750
well it's definitely his kid.
They look just alike.

132
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,620
Did you see that shadow and how many 
dumplings do they have a fucking day?

133
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:31,621
Everybody else in the country's fucking 
emaciated look like they just finished 

134
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:33,220
the Tour de France.
These guys are walking around.

135
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,420
Plump.
Yeah,

136
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:39,421
like they are on the sixth kid.
Dad bought this so smooth and hairless 

137
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:41,650
too.
That just fucking creepy.

138
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:43,270
I love him.
Did you see that?

139
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,040
What's that guy's name?
[inaudible] eight.

140
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,230
How do you say that guy's name?
Basquiat.

141
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,310
That basquiat painting that went from 
$110,000,000.

142
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,710
I want to see what?
Yes,

143
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,430
it did.
You want to see 110 million buys?

144
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:58,100
You want to get grossed out.
This Japanese who bought it?

145
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,910
Some super billionaire character who 
apparently has another one that he spent

146
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:06,320
50 something billion or million on 110.
That guy?

147
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:11,321
Yeah,
that's when you're like eating 

148
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:12,260
endangered species for breakfast.
That stupid fucking painting.

149
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,650
That's $110 million.
It looks like some shit.

150
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:18,710
I drew when I was a kid and my parents 
put it on the refrigerator like,

151
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,150
yeah,
it's great.

152
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,180
There should be like notebook,
like they know that that confetti that 

153
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,180
hangs off the side.
Yeah.

154
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,210
What's with the Tic Tac toe on his head 
to.

155
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:29,780
What's that about tic TAC toe and is.
Hey Joe.

156
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:31,670
It's whatever you want it to me man.
It's all right.

157
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:34,580
It's up to your own interpretation.
I like the blue.

158
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,870
I always found blue to be soothing a.
The guy looks a little disturbed.

159
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,910
Look at him trying to find his place 
within the blue skies of white America.

160
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,140
It's like the left corner.
What did?

161
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,370
He was a little kid and he fucked up and
he just scratched over it like the a and

162
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:55,781
the b.
But he made the beat backwards and when 

163
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:55,781
Shit and so we just scratched over it.

164
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:56,800
I just left it there.
Like,

165
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:57,860
look at that.
What is that?

166
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,560
It's whatever you want it to be.
One hundred $10,000,000.

167
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,740
That's what it is.
And they go,

168
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:08,741
that's lachman right there.
They would kill to have that piece 

169
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:10,520
hanging in there and there'll be all 
kinds of women with weird glasses riding

170
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:15,050
that train up there to go look at it.
Rubbed the Chins with their gay friends.

171
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,060
Look at him with that guy.
Last bastard.

172
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,470
Now he's killing it.
Dude.

173
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,580
You think so?
Yeah.

174
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,010
Look at him.
He's in great shape with that haircut.

175
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,160
No,
definitely no conditioner.

176
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,590
Huh?
I can't tell if his hair's just starting

177
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:32,591
to go grey yet.
But isn't that like a billionaire 

178
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:32,591
genius?
Like you're such a.

179
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:37,261
you're so good at business that you 
forget to put conditioner in your hair 

180
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:39,530
and you get like sleep coming out of 
your rye and some hot hot.

181
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,660
He just fucking hoses you off in the 
morning.

182
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,530
Just wear this.
I can't.

183
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:48,531
I just keep thinking.
There was a video that I watched the 

184
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:51,611
other day of Elon Musk from 1998 when he
was first becoming a billionaire and a,

185
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,340
he bought a million dollar car and he 
had his million dollar car delivered 

186
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,100
with his girlfriend at the time.
We got rid of,

187
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,580
let's say at the same time and you all.
My girlfriend put her in the trunk,

188
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,270
but it's so funny to see him as this 
young Dork who's,

189
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:13,210
you know,
just making shit tons of money and his 

190
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:13,670
hair's all goofy and he has this million
dollar car delivered.

191
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,830
Who's this?
Elon Musk.

192
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,900
He owns Tesla.
Tesla.

193
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:19,760
Okay.
Did you see what you see what he's doing

194
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,140
now?
But the video is hilarious.

195
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,090
Have you seen what he's doing now?
The boring company.

196
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:23,780
Didn't know what that is.

197
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,970
Where they make like electric jets or 
something?

198
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,020
No,
that boring holes underneath Los 

199
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,730
Angeles.
He's gonna bore these earthquake proof 

200
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,041
tunnels and they're going to put sleds 
on these tunnels that go 125 miles an 

201
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,370
hour.
So you drive onto the sled,

202
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,400
it locks you in and it shoots you from 
like downtown La to wherever the fuck 

203
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,140
you're going in.
You know?

204
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,630
Is this it Jamie?
So this is how it works.

205
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,610
You drive onto this sled,
it drops you down,

206
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:56,650
guy just gets it lists.
It drops you down below the surface of 

207
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,230
the earth.
Now,

208
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,100
one of these others,
other.

209
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,460
These are sleds.
So your car is amazing.

210
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:04,650
I want that to happen.
It's gonna happen,

211
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,950
this crazy fucker.
He's gonna make it and these sleds,

212
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,040
I mean you can't crash into anybody so 
they can go stupid fast.

213
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,380
So they're going 125 miles an hour now.

214
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,000
Now,
now they're created by men.

215
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,640
So at some point somebody is going to 
not tighten something down.

216
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,180
Well,
those teslas don't have the best service

217
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,200
record as far as or reliability record.
Sam Harris has broke down twice already 

218
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,840
and I know other,
another guy who got one in the handle,

219
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:33,840
stop coming out like you know,
you go near it and handle comes out.

220
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,060
He can break into your own an electric 
car.

221
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,830
But look at this.
Another guy gets to get in.

222
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:41,700
There was going to be align traffic jam 
to get onto these fucking things,

223
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:46,170
but look at this passage way system that
he's devising is going to be crazy.

224
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,160
There's going to be these passageways 
all throughout the bottom of the earth.

225
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,610
So underneath the surface of the,
of Los Angeles will be on the streets,

226
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,830
but of course it's going to cave in,
right?

227
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:56,250
It's going to.

228
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,730
It's got to somehow compromise the 
structure.

229
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,430
The city,
right.

230
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,170
All those building,
sitting on top of it.

231
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,470
Uh,
I don't know if anybody can figure it 

232
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,470
out.
It would be.

233
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,900
I think that's beyond my pay grade 
ground.

234
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,010
I will,
you know,

235
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:13,011
is most more,
even more amazing than that is that 

236
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:15,081
Japanese built billionaire.
It looked like the Japanese Charles 

237
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:15,081
Bronson.
If you go back,

238
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,180
I love Charles Bronson.
He does a little bit.

239
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,850
He looks tough like Charles Bronson and 
the mechanic.

240
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,070
Like that one.
I've seen all his fucking movie.

241
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:23,750
I love all that.
He,

242
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,770
I've,
I've even watched his Cologne ad that he

243
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:27,650
did over there.
Oh yeah.

244
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,070
What he saw,
he saw the,

245
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:31,180
uh,
you saw the softest side of.

246
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,610
Oh yeah,
he's taking his shirt off.

247
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,340
You spin it around this realignment.
Yeah.

248
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:37,110
It was very.
Not Charles Bronson.

249
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:41,370
That's back when stars would do for some
reason only in this country.

250
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,370
It was,
it hurt your career if you did a 

251
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:46,370
commercial,
but you could always overseas,

252
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,680
you know,
do something like that you could just 

253
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,440
use to hurt their career.
But it doesn't seem to anymore.

254
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Like not only does it not now,
it's like a move.

255
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,940
Now it's like,
why aren't you just going up vacuuming,

256
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,070
vacuuming up this cash?
Yeah.

257
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,770
Like now,
matthew mcconaughey.

258
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Look at him.
Look at that.

259
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,930
I'm telling you,
I nailed it.

260
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,860
He's got to Charles Bronson.
He's got to work on the hair though.

261
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,180
He's got the fucking mustache is a 
little too humble with a smile.

262
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,600
He used to be a little more solemn.
Just just accept the fact you're a 

263
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,261
baller.
Billionaire pays $110 for a stupid 

264
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:21,261
painting.
He does.

265
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:22,620
You know what?
Going back to what he does look a little

266
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:27,621
lost.
Maybe he just doesn't like his picture 

267
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,271
taken.
I'm always looking to give somebody the 

268
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:29,970
benefit of the doubt here or maybe he's 
realizing they just spent $110,000,000

269
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:31,620
on a stupid fucking painting and he's 
like,

270
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:33,630
what?
What did it sell for the last time?

271
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,500
I don't know.

272
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,360
That's interesting.
It's good question.

273
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,450
I wonder what he saw and see if he could
find that commercial.

274
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:47,451
The Charles Bronson Cologne commercial.
I want to say that it's got to be 

275
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:51,171
online.
Why would you tell people that you 

276
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:54,861
bought that and then that's in your 
house like didn't nobody learned 

277
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:56,980
anything from the fucking Kardashians.
Look at all the jewelry I got.

278
00:11:56,981 --> 00:12:01,981
Next thing you know you're face down 
with a fucking gun to the back of your 

279
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:01,981
head.
You've got to watch out with that.

280
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:01,981
This guy's fucking.
He's got 110.

281
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:03,790
It was like a million dollar ring.
He's got like 100,

282
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,330
$10,000,000
piece of art with.

283
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:11,331
The crazy thing about the Kardashian 
thing was that it was in Paris and she 

284
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:14,521
brought security with her.
She had security with her and they 

285
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:14,590
figured out how to get past security.
Yeah,

286
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:16,000
but everything's better in Europe,
isn't what?

287
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,630
Everybody says that the criminals are 
better than our security.

288
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,280
There's Charles Bronson.
Oh,

289
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:25,420
this is Charles Bronson laid in his life
to this deathwish.

290
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,750
Charles Bronson.
Yeah.

291
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,490
Paul Kurzy.

292
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,870
It's like a mini movie.
Yes.

293
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,460
What was this for?
What?

294
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,360
What?
A country.

295
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,860
Somewhere like in Japan.
Yeah.

296
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,120
They definitely didn't do it here.
What a weird drive.

297
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,100
The guide.
That gate.

298
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,090
Good night,
Mr Bronson sleep tight.

299
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,470
Now we're driving off drives a command.
Now all of a sudden it gets,

300
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,280
here we go.
Oh Wow.

301
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,180
Which gets actually coming off.
What in the fuck is this?

302
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,820
This is a man getting paid.
He's got his pipe on his shirt off.

303
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,470
He's by himself.
You don't realize how jack this guy was.

304
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,910
Oh yeah.
So back then.

305
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,760
Not only that,
he was probably 60 at the time,

306
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,920
like Charles Bronson,
I believe when he watched him to 

307
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,360
Tarantino Shit here with shooting guns 
and stuff.

308
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,600
This is late in his career too.
I'm telling you,

309
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:42,601
he might've been 60 here because when he
was in hard times he was 50

310
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,260
man.
Damn man.

311
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,330
That's beyond.
That's the kingdom of a man.

312
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:52,150
What you're putting on them.
Their to 1976.

313
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:57,100
It says find out when hard times was.
Oh,

314
00:13:57,101 --> 00:14:01,830
Japanese bandom man to that works over 
there.

315
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,370
Hard Times was what?
Seventy five.

316
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:07,250
So he was 51 when he did that.
Wow.

317
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,530
Checked in the range.
Yeah.

318
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,150
Well it could have been hard times.
He was five.

319
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,180
I bet they sold a ton of that.
Look at that.

320
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,480
That's a 50 year old men know hgh.
No testosterone,

321
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,130
just fucking pushups,
sit ups and drinking milk.

322
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,090
He grew up in a linear work in mines and
stuff in Poland or something.

323
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:25,540
Yeah,
those guys.

324
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,570
All those guys back then.
You know what I like about those old 

325
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,181
movies.
So many of them is when you watch an 

326
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:34,390
army movie from back then you're 
watching someone who was in the army and

327
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:35,140
shot at people.

328
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,890
So it's like they actually,
you know,

329
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,800
Lee Marvin,
like he was one of two people to survive

330
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,660
in his platoon.
Shay,

331
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,010
I got shot and stuff.
Yes.

332
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,030
I think this psychotic nerve issue with 
something from where he got shot or 

333
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,770
something like this guy live like,
like actors weren't,

334
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,400
you know what they are now,
where it was a lot of pretend.

335
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,510
I mean,
Jesus,

336
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,670
we've been over in Iraq for 15 years.
I'm sure you could,

337
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,820
you like there's going to be the next 
Lee marvins are going to come out of 

338
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:03,820
that.
Um,

339
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,670
maybe.
Maybe.

340
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:09,671
I don't know.
Do you remember when I just say thanks 

341
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:09,671
Joe.
I do too.

342
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:14,630
Who is that one guy that was like one of
the first original movie stars and he 

343
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,130
was a world war two veteran audie 
Murphy.

344
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,150
Is that,
was that his name?

345
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,230
There was a guy who most,
most of them are famous war hero 

346
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,080
veterans because of the level of the 
draft.

347
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,440
But then it becomes.
What did you do when you were there when

348
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:27,470
it was like a,
some of the,

349
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,310
some of them,
you know,

350
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:29,530
they,
they were like,

351
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:31,580
you know,
infrastructure or whatever.

352
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:33,740
And then there's other people that were 
actually like,

353
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,750
upfront this is happening.
This is the guy he was,

354
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,940
he became a movie star.
We'll look at all this stuff on his 

355
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:43,940
coat.
He must've done something over there.

356
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,620
He was a,
he was a decorated.

357
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:50,621
Okay.
So it's one of the most decorated 

358
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:50,621
American combat soldiers in World War 
Two.

359
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:53,600
And then a single handedly held off an 
entire German.

360
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,570
That's the guy ran up with the Canadian 
soldiers for an hour.

361
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,330
Yeah.
Wow.

362
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,540
So then he came back and became a movie 
star and like people knew he enjoyed a 

363
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:07,160
21 year acting career and then it just 
stopped.

364
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,880
Well,
he didn't even like the Congressional 

365
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,950
Medal of honor is like,
most people don't win that and they're 

366
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:14,950
still alive.
Right.

367
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,630
So back then that was like a celebrity 
like you,

368
00:16:16,631 --> 00:16:20,150
you had to hold off an entire platoon 
for a German platoon two,

369
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,720
it makes Porsche's and Mercedes like 
their,

370
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,750
you know,
their level of guns that they had over 

371
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,521
there.
Like our machine guns overheated and 

372
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:30,521
theirs didn't.
So if you killed a German guy,

373
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:34,601
you threw,
you threw away the American shit and 

374
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:34,601
picked up their stuff.
Isn't that crazy?

375
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:34,730
Yeah.
One of my favorite quotes ever,

376
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:37,610
one of the German tank commanders was 
saying every one of their,

377
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:38,780
uh,
where they,

378
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,220
uh,
pantsers is that what this was called?

379
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,410
And I was with the Sherman tanks,
a German tiger.

380
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,740
A tiger was worth like four American 
tanks,

381
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:50,741
but the Americans always had five.
We just totally McDonald's to billions 

382
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:50,960
and billions.
Sarah,

383
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,640
we just kept cranking it out.
It was like we got them right.

384
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:55,460
And then they'd always be that last one 
coming over the hill.

385
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,670
Well,
they had some massive canon in world war

386
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:03,671
one that apparently you took like 100 
men to move this enormous fucking cannon

387
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,210
and a Dan Carlin was talking about it.
A little hard men.

388
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,760
Hardcore history.
What's 100 blue white men to move it?

389
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,080
They wouldn't let anybody without blue 
eyes moved.

390
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:15,320
The thick.
Did hit live in have blue eyes.

391
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,910
That was weird.
He was.

392
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,500
He was a dark haired guy.
No,

393
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,900
he did.
He looks like a cab driver in Germany.

394
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:27,460
He was everything he hated.
That was the funny thing about it was 

395
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:27,460
not a good dancer.
If you ever saw him do his victory.

396
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,890
Jigs definitely was afraid of dogs.
Really.

397
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,700
I'm just repeating shit that said 
jeopardy.

398
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,710
It is amazing to kind of engineering 
that German people have come up with.

399
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,600
When you think about Mercedes,
Porsche,

400
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:43,190
Audi,
BMW,

401
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,920
out of this one part of the world.
No,

402
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:48,920
and they evidently a lot of the leaders 
felt,

403
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,110
oh my God,
look at that fucking cannon.

404
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,560
What is that thing called most powerful 
gun ever built?

405
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,460
Heavy Gustov railway gun.
So they put this thing on.

406
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,210
It looks like it's on tractor tires,
like it looks like a tractor.

407
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,950
Right?
And they're there.

408
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,370
I guess they drove this thing up,
but uh,

409
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,080
it just had,
just,

410
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,720
just the way Dan Carlin described it as 
incredible,

411
00:18:13,721 --> 00:18:16,630
like this unbelievable shockwave.
Everybody,

412
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:21,631
you have to run a mile away when the 
thing was going off and plug your ears 

413
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:25,240
up just because it'll blow your eardrums
literally apart.

414
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,490
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

415
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:31,940
They show this thing going off.
What's wrong with people?

416
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,220
Oh,
how is war still legal?

417
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:36,920
I just don't get how that's legal,
you know what I mean?

418
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:39,230
Like I can't walk into a bar,
you know,

419
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,330
it punch somebody in the face if they 
punched me,

420
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,000
be like fucking go to jail.
But like this shit is like,

421
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,350
can't these leaders just kind of solve 
things amongst themselves?

422
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,630
No,
they can't carve it up a little.

423
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,660
Just I listen.
You take the Philippines and now you 

424
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,560
give us Guam for the uh,
like,

425
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,230
like,
uh,

426
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:58,850
you know,
owners of football.

427
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,890
Isn't it amazing that we even have 
what's legal and what's not legal?

428
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:04,810
I mean,
what does that mean?

429
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,530
Wrote it down on paper.
We all agreed,

430
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,590
I mean thinking about the shit that 
isn't isn't legal and the fact that war 

431
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,560
is on that list at all.
I like laws to you.

432
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,730
Like what ones

433
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,710
you can't beat the shit out of him.
He can't come into my house and take my 

434
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,200
stuff.
What am I going to do?

435
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,030
What am I honestly going to do about it?

436
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,350
I was thinking about that when I was 
watching the UFC this past weekend.

437
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,740
I was watching this,
a frightful beating that Alexander 

438
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,430
Gustafson put on glover to share and it 
was just a ruthless knockout,

439
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,450
just fucking vicious beat down and then 
eventually stopped him and I was 

440
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,710
thinking it's kind of crazy that these 
guys agreed to do this.

441
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:47,010
They agree to do this.
Everybody signs away and then you go do 

442
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:47,070
something that anywhere else in the 
world you would get locked down.

443
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,490
You arrested.

444
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,780
That happens in hockey every once in 
awhile where somebody goes too far and 

445
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,750
then the government gets involved.
Really?

446
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,750
Yeah.
Like what do they do if you hit somebody

447
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:02,751
in the head with a stick that goes 
outside the boundaries of a setting,

448
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:05,390
the tone that seems like a pussy move 
though.

449
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,470
Hit Him with a stick.
You're supposed to punch.

450
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,560
It's so weird when you got the stick in 
your hand,

451
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:17,060
you know it,
it just the shit that you sometimes 

452
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,060
think of doing it each other in the 
balls.

453
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:20,950
They fucking whack at the bay.
There's no padding behind your legs.

454
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:23,880
And just imagine that just taken,
taking a would stick it just ah,

455
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,150
with NHL level strength and just given 
someone a two hander,

456
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,490
the backlight they break people's finger
crosby on was,

457
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:30,870
took somebody's finger off this year.

458
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,500
If they get too far,
look,

459
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,700
if it gets really.
If they just opened the rules up a 

460
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:37,700
little bit,
you know what's gonna Happen?

461
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,051
They're gonna.
Bring in figure skaters and they're 

462
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:42,961
going to teach them taekwondo and 
they're going to cut people's fucking 

463
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:42,961
heads off the

464
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:45,220
skates.
Dude,

465
00:20:45,221 --> 00:20:46,550
you're spinning,
man.

466
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,980
If you ever learned how to skate,
you'd

467
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,320
be fucking dangerous.
If you ever did that with skates on,

468
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:51,520
that would be it.
That's what I'm saying.

469
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:54,850
If you teach that to somebody,
teach that to somebody with skates.

470
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:57,130
I mean if you could hit someone with a 
hockey stick,

471
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,740
why can't you hit him on skate on the 
line here?

472
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,180
Can hit them with this slip.
They do it.

473
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Somebody does it to you now.
They slashed and they do stuff like 

474
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:06,480
that.
You can't club somebody over.

475
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,630
I mean even slashing so.
Okay.

476
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:10,450
I'll just slash your leg out.
What would you rather have?

477
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Would you rather have tickets get hit by
a piece of wood and you don't have a 

478
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,300
bruise there or have somebody slashy 
with escape?

479
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,370
I would absolutely rather get hit by the
piece of wood,

480
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:19,930
but I shouldn't get hit by the piece of 
wood.

481
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,280
I don't.
I don't play hockey,

482
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,290
but if I did play hockey I'd be pretty 
pissed.

483
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:28,290
If somebody hit me with a stick.
I built like you fucking pussy and I'd 

484
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,190
want to hit a like the second coming of 
Thai Domi.

485
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,230
You have the exact same build.
He's a fucking guy who somehow was like 

486
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:39,450
my height and was considered a 
heavyweight fighter and he's the guy 

487
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,150
according to him,
he came up with the,

488
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,530
grab them by,
right,

489
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:50,710
right underneath your collar and then 
turn all the way sideways because he 

490
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,610
didn't have the reach advantage.
Oh.

491
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,820
And then he would,
he would wait for them to throw he duck 

492
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:56,820
under and then come over the top.
And Dude,

493
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,630
I,
I met him one time,

494
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,190
great fucking guy.
And he,

495
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,900
he's got these.
Has like your hands,

496
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,980
use your hands.
You make like that.

497
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:04,600
It turns into a hammer.
It's the same thing.

498
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:09,601
He has like these inexplicable,
like bare fucking pause and I might be a

499
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:11,710
little taller than him.

500
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,450
And I remember when he's tried to show 
me when he grabbed the front of my shirt

501
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:17,440
to show me,
like,

502
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:19,700
I literally felt like an adrenaline,
like a flashback.

503
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,290
I hope this guy doesn't snap.
Now he's one of the,

504
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,580
like these.
He's one of the toughest guys that ever,

505
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,380
uh,
ever played.

506
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:26,950
Well,
you know,

507
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:28,840
when Rocky Marciano was the heavyweight 
champion,

508
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:32,890
he was the only 185 pounds is 185 pounds
and he was 5:10.

509
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,130
He was the heavyweight champion.
That's because it wasn't Tim Horton's on

510
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:41,131
everybody's every fucking corner.
They wouldn't feed and cows the other 

511
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:41,220
cows and be like,
I had needed.

512
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,110
See what happens.
Kids hit puberty at like eight.

513
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:46,990
Now you got to like teach them how to 
shave.

514
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,490
I mean,
I don't know what is in a hormones.

515
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,300
Well,
who knows what it is,

516
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:54,160
but it's no lump.
Monsanto change their,

517
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:55,720
uh,
their name.

518
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,430
You know what I mean?
What do they know?

519
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,680
I don't know what shit that's,
that's the genius of it.

520
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:01,690
Because then you don't know it the same 
way.

521
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:05,150
Halliburton changed the same way Nissan.
Nissan changed from,

522
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,550
from Dotson.
Oh,

523
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,420
that's right.
Yeah,

524
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,460
that's right.
Wonder why they do that.

525
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:11,600
Dotson do made some good cars.
Oh,

526
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,850
there.
They always go over the cliff.

527
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,780
Toyota did that too with Alexis.
The dots and I want to get fucking sued.

528
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,570
Honda and Toyota in this country,
they both do the same thing.

529
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,650
They have this weird division where they
make a luxury brand for Americans.

530
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,630
You know,
they don't do like Acura and Honda.

531
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:28,630
They don't do that in Japan.
Like if you buy an Nsx in Japan,

532
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:30,640
which the top end car,
it's a Honda.

533
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,740
It's a Honda Nsx.
Okay.

534
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,880
But in America we're like,
no,

535
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,110
you need something.

536
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,890
You need a better name.
No,

537
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:40,891
but we have this space.
Are you saying that they can't get a 

538
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:40,891
luxury car over there?
No,

539
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:40,960
no,
no.

540
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,500
They changed the name in America because
we don't.

541
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,930
We don't want buy a Toyota.
We assume a Toyota is a cheap car.

542
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,250
So they go,
okay,

543
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,730
well we're going to make a different 
brand of Toyota and call it a lexis.

544
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,450
And everybody's like,
okay,

545
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:55,100
we're in.
So long as he changed the name.

546
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,090
Oh,
okay.

547
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:01,230
I always list literally gonna make up 
without any research that because they 

548
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,950
weren't an island want to drive.
They don't have anywhere to drive,

549
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:05,960
so they don't.
They don't let them fast cars.

550
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,740
Even that guy with $110,000,000,000
to buy a picture,

551
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,860
it's got nowhere to go now.
He has like a civic.

552
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,870
He's,
he can't spend his money on cars,

553
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,130
so that's why buys the art.
You're a car guy though,

554
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,840
you know,
they have pretty fast cars.

555
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:23,360
I mean they have ridiculously fast cars.
They have the GTR.

556
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,710
It's one of the fastest cars in the 
world.

557
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,240
I know,
but I've never been there.

558
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,650
So you can.
Yeah.

559
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:32,651
I just started to listen to what you 
were saying and then then that whole 

560
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:32,651
theory developed in my head.

561
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,800
Japan is small,
but it's not that small.

562
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,510
No,
it isn't.

563
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:40,120
Can I mention that is for family that it
came out today.

564
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:45,750
That's why I'm here.
That's why I dragged you out of bed or 

565
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,750
whatever you were doing to do the 
special podcast,

566
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,900
which I appreciate.
Um,

567
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,950
I season to season two of F is for 
family,

568
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:52,990
is available for,
to stream all of it.

569
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,350
It took us a year to make it and you can
devour it in five hours.

570
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Wow.
If you have food delivered and then you 

571
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:01,750
can ask me when season three coming out,
which is what I hope you ask me,

572
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:02,950
because that would mean that you enjoyed
it.

573
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,650
I love this fucking show.
It's a hilarious show.

574
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,510
Oh,
I'm looking forward to the season.

575
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,970
It's fun and I work with great people.
Thank God.

576
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:12,150
Because if I didn't the amount of work 
that it was,

577
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,150
it would actually be misery.
But it isn't work though.

578
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,600
How much work does it take you a,
like it takes a year to make,

579
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,310
but how much does it take?
How long does it take you?

580
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,410
Well,
I mean the writers room is like a,

581
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,430
uh,
you know,

582
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,440
like a 10 week,
11 week thing and then you're recording 

583
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,710
as you go and then you're looking at,
you know,

584
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,380
the first drawings of it with a sort of 
rough it out and be like,

585
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:35,700
no,
no,

586
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,280
I have frank standing over here and 
sue's over here and then it just Kinda,

587
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:45,390
you just keep.
Then you rewrite and then you watch and 

588
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,390
stuff and it doesn't play and then you 
rewrite it and it just.

589
00:25:46,391 --> 00:25:47,230
Yeah,
it takes a year,

590
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:52,231
dude.
It takes like 10 months and then the 

591
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:53,611
last two months is just going okay.
Deciding on strategies on how they're 

592
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:58,231
going to a promoted,
which amazed me because I'm like,

593
00:25:58,961 --> 00:26:03,961
well we'll fucking do what we always do,
but like this business just changes so 

594
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:07,351
rapidly that even how we promoted it 
when it first came out in December 2015,

595
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,450
you know,
which is almost 2016.

596
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:15,451
So now we're in 2017.
Like it's a bunch of other stuff has 

597
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:16,840
changed since then.
So I don't know like what,

598
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,070
what's changed?
What do you mean?

599
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,160
I fucking knew you were gonna ask me.
Sorry.

600
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,280
I'll just let you go.
I can't.

601
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,310
What was it?
No more questions.

602
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,950
No,
they would just go in like they brought 

603
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:29,950
me,
they

604
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:29,950
brought me in.
Maybe this is my standup special.

605
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,470
That's why they brought me in and they 
showed.

606
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,950
They basically showed me how everybody's
Netflix screen is different.

607
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,980
Like yours is different than your 
homepage is different because it's all 

608
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,010
there just watching you watch

609
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,070
tv or they got this fucking thing that 
watches it.

610
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:52,071
So the only way our screen within our 
top whatever be the exact same as if we 

611
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:54,570
watch the exact same shit at the same 
time.

612
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,460
And maybe even the same age group,
I have no idea,

613
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:58,810
but I was blown away by that.
Like I just thought like,

614
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,350
you know,
I would look and be,

615
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,620
oh man,
my specials on,

616
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,630
on the cover of Netflix.
It's like,

617
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:04,830
no,
it's on the cover of yours.

618
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,730
And whoever else is in that,
that vibe of like you're gonna like 

619
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,441
this.
I have three different profiles of one 

620
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:15,450
profile and then I have one profile for 
each of my kids.

621
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,670
Okay.
So I see different stuff.

622
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,430
So I see that.
So if I go to my kid's homepage,

623
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,070
like if they want to watch a show that 
they watch and I go there,

624
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:26,010
I see just a bunch of little kids show.
I don't ever see anything that I watch.

625
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,360
I go to mine,
I see house,

626
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:32,361
a car,
the car special as the other people's 

627
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:32,361
specials.
So yeah,

628
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:32,361
that's what they do.
This,

629
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:33,360
they're very smart with their 
algorithms.

630
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:36,120
But what I don't like is this fucking 
thumbs up,

631
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,590
thumbs down,
bullshit.

632
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,850
I can't do that.
What?

633
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,340
That.
I was joking about that on my podcast.

634
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:44,190
It's like a,
a Adolf Hitler,

635
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:47,460
thumbs down,
orange juice after brushing your teeth,

636
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,240
thumbs down.

637
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,340
You know what I mean?
It's true.

638
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,490
Ice Cream,
thumbs up threesome with supermodel.

639
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:58,320
Thumbs up.
Yeah.

640
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,490
It's like,
what the fuck?

641
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,290
Did they really do that because of Amy 
Schumer.

642
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,750
That's the.
No,

643
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,270
no,
that was.

644
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,730
That was already.
Yeah,

645
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:06,440
they do that.
Why would they do that?

646
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,880
The hemophilia,
when you're that fucking big,

647
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:13,881
you can't make decisions that quickly,
but everybody wanted it to be done for 

648
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:14,150
her.
Identify.

649
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,590
Well,
you know,

650
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,140
they got to bring it back.
The star system is a perfect system.

651
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,600
Everybody's used to it.
Yes.

652
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,570
Has been using it forever.
It works.

653
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,000
Yes,
but what is this star is starts.

654
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,490
Somebody told me the star system only 
applies.

655
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,190
It's like geared towards what you would 
like.

656
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:34,191
I'm like,
how the fuck would they know that that 

657
00:28:34,191 --> 00:28:36,021
doesn't make any sense.
And then I heard that that's not the 

658
00:28:36,021 --> 00:28:36,021
case,
that it's basically just a,

659
00:28:36,021 --> 00:28:36,900
an average of all the people.

660
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,900
Just like on Amazon,
if you go to Amazon and you look at 

661
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,481
something,
you see five stars and you see 175 

662
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:44,481
reviews,
that's what it is.

663
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:48,900
Right.
But somebody told me that wasn't the 

664
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:48,900
star system,
wasn't that.

665
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:48,960
See if he could find that out.
Jamie.

666
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,770
Somebody said the star system was based 
on whether or not you would like it.

667
00:28:52,771 --> 00:28:54,360
I'm like,
that seems ridiculous because I've never

668
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:55,980
rented a fucking thing in my life on 
him.

669
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:01,070
On netflix.
I don't get any of these places and I 

670
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,470
don't understand how any of them fucking
work.

671
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,750
I just,
I go old school,

672
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,390
like I just tried it.
Whatever I'm doing,

673
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:10,740
I try to make it as funny as I possibly 
can and try to work with the best people

674
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:12,960
I possibly can and then just hope it 
sticks.

675
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,170
If it doesn't,
I can always just keep telling jokes.

676
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,300
Other than that,
I don't know what to tell you.

677
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:21,840
I have no idea.
I was fuck when I took that meeting with

678
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:23,280
Netflix.
I wouldn't even like,

679
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:26,400
this is a jerk off meeting.
Why did I drive all the way over here to

680
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:31,430
fucking have a meeting on how to promote
this shit and when they sat down and 

681
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,920
they were done with the presentation,
I always am.

682
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:35,580
I allowed to leave.
Like you don't do the men in black thing

683
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:40,581
to me before I walk out of here.
So I forget all that was fucking 

684
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:40,581
amazing.
It was fucking amazing.

685
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:45,590
Like the with which every goddamn like 
there's not one drop of water that rolls

686
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:47,820
off the table.
They'd like their,

687
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,890
they're catching it all.
I don't know how they,

688
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,300
you know,
I'm just not wired that way.

689
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,790
Well that's probably good though.
There's only so much

690
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,670
time of the day,
like just to think about being funny and

691
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,790
just concentrate and stay in your lanes.
Probably the best option anyway

692
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,460
is that I.
I mean it's working for me.

693
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,510
Yeah,
it's working for me.

694
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:09,511
And then there's also worried about 
algorithms and then there's also a 

695
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:12,961
certain level of known that you don't 
want to get to because then it stops 

696
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:14,980
being fun.
And then Tom Cruise does A.

697
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,500
Yeah,
well early Tom Cruise.

698
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:22,501
It was fun to be that famous,
but before social media and everybody 

699
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:25,441
had a camera that they could pull out 
like Charles Bronson and that alone 

700
00:30:25,441 --> 00:30:27,700
commercial.
Then it just becomes.

701
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,850
It's just something completely 
different.

702
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:34,270
Like when we started in this business 
like being famous

703
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,170
court side seats and I don't know,
look at the shock and mountains of blow.

704
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,660
Here's the.
It says Netflix star systems.

705
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,260
Star Star ratings were personalized and 
had been from the start.

706
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:48,160
That means when you saw a movie on 
Netflix rated four stars didn't mean the

707
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:50,470
average of all the ratings were forced 
ours,

708
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:55,471
and instead it meant that Netflix 
thought you'd rate it four stars based 

709
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:56,560
on your habits and other people's 
ratings,

710
00:30:56,561 --> 00:31:01,561
but many people didn't get that.
So how the fuck was Amy Schumer's 

711
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:02,140
Onestar?
Everybody gave it one star.

712
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,190
How's that?
How's that work?

713
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:08,191
That was Sandinista rebels just.
They just all got on and then they 

714
00:31:08,191 --> 00:31:09,180
threatened the people that liked her 
specialty.

715
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,360
That's how it went down.
Well,

716
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:12,370
I guess in that case what they did was 
they just said,

717
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,350
look,
Greenpeace attacked by so many,

718
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,230
it just ruined all my chances for the 
rest.

719
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,170
I did this joke about trees and they 
just didn't like it.

720
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,590
And that's it for me.
That works.

721
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,530
Now.
This is a whole new world.

722
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:29,810
Um,

723
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,340
that seems weird though to me that they 
wouldn't like let it actually be rated 

724
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:41,030
that they,
the ratings were personalized based on 

725
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,280
the shit that you liked.
But how the fuck do they know what you 

726
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,280
like?
You just know what I watched it.

727
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,070
So it's a riddle wrapped up in an 
enigma.

728
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,770
You're not going to figure out a fucking
worldwide.

729
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,570
I don't know how they do it.
I don't know how to.

730
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,370
All I know is I went and I took the 
meeting.

731
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:54,200
I was like,
this is fucking unbelievable.

732
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,940
Or they're on top of shit.
You know,

733
00:31:55,941 --> 00:31:58,100
the weirdest one is Alexa.
Alexa,

734
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,840
the Amazon one.
They're using it.

735
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,280
The trainings.
I was like a porn star.

736
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:01,850
Yeah,
it does.

737
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,620
I'm sure there's a bunch of the stage 
Alexa.

738
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,740
They're trying to use that.
Alexa is a thing that you talk to you 

739
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:11,740
like Alexa,
play bill burrs album,

740
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,900
and you know I have no sympathy for 
people that bring that in their house 

741
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,720
and because those mouth breathing 
fucking morons will someday will be 

742
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,571
mandatory that I do and get microchipped
and then that's going to be the end of 

743
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:24,290
any sort of rebellion and whatever the 
fuck they want to do,

744
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:29,740
that's it.
The emperor can literally fuck a 

745
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,421
flounder on TV at that point and they 
will be able to stop any sort of like 

746
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:33,020
fucking any dissent,
any dissent.

747
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,730
They'll turn off your chip,
which is your money.

748
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,070
What are you gonna rebel against the 
slip with a slingshot.

749
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,560
It's over.
It's a rap,

750
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:39,980
but

751
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,070
there's too many mouth breather and 
morons being like,

752
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,060
well,
why do I care if somebody,

753
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:46,580
if I'm not fucking door and a thing?
Those people.

754
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,020
Yeah,
I've.

755
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,150
I've had the.
I had that argument with a very smart 

756
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,271
person when the NSA shit went down and 
they found that they were listening to 

757
00:32:55,271 --> 00:32:55,271
the calls.
Guys like,

758
00:32:55,271 --> 00:32:55,271
go ahead,
listen.

759
00:32:55,271 --> 00:32:56,900
If it keeps fucking terrorists from 
attacking,

760
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:58,520
go ahead and listen.
I'm not doing anything wrong,

761
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,600
like,
wow,

762
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:01,460
that's not.
That's not what it is.

763
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:04,500
Like anybody could find out your email,
they can go in your email,

764
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:09,530
look at your emails and decide whether 
or not you're doing something wrong or 

765
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:09,950
right.
Decide they don't like that.

766
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:11,630
Once they have that jurisdiction,
that could even.

767
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,520
Even if it didn't have anything,
they could say you did.

768
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,950
Yeah,
definitely.

769
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:15,620
Kit,
they get they.

770
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,840
They could alter your emails.
They could do whatever they want.

771
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,780
That's nobody gets whacked anymore.
People used to get whacked.

772
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:22,890
You don't get whacked anymore in any 
kill.

773
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:28,260
You though.
Will they think that seth rich guy got 

774
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:28,260
killed?
Who said paying attention to that?

775
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,630
Listen to shit.
I just talk.

776
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,840
I'm just gonna say you could just kill 
them in the media one dick pic.

777
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:37,250
It'd be like,
that is his dick.

778
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,470
I'll give you the conspiracy theory and 
I gave you what they know.

779
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,500
There's a guy named seth rich.
She's apparently a Bernie Sanders 

780
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:44,500
supporter.
He's working for the DNC.

781
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,810
Found out that the DNC was democratic.
National Convention.

782
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,650
Natural.
Yeah.

783
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,120
National Chanel.
Yeah.

784
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,270
He found out that they were fucking over
Bernie Sanders,

785
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:57,860
and so he supposedly was giving this 
information to wikileaks.

786
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,070
All that information got out,
it hurt Hillary because it turned and it

787
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:03,860
hurt the DNC,
the DNC head of the DNC left,

788
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,790
and when she resigned and immediately 
went to work for Hillary Clinton.

789
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,910
Anyway,
this guy who wiki leaks and there was no

790
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:13,700
followup because once she resides in 
mainstream news.

791
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:15,170
That's the end of the fucking story.
Yeah.

792
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:20,171
There was no follow.
It was pretty outrageous that she 

793
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:20,171
immediately got hired by Hillary 
Clinton.

794
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:20,171
Right.
But anyway,

795
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:21,890
the kid who was as Bernie Sanders 
support,

796
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:24,620
his name is seth rich,
he was murdered outside of his house,

797
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:25,370
4:00
in the morning.

798
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:27,410
They said it was a robbery.
They left his money.

799
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:28,730
He left his wallet,
he left his phone,

800
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:30,590
they left his watch.
Nothing was taken from him,

801
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:32,870
but he was shot in the back at 4:00
in the morning.

802
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,320
So Julian Assan from wikileaks said that
there are consequences for working with 

803
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:40,660
us and providing us information.
So they're saying,

804
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,290
are you saying this guy provided him 
information?

805
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,180
He said,
that's just what I'm saying,

806
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,700
there's calm,
there's consequences to work with us,

807
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,270
and then there's this other guy,
Kim dot was this famous,

808
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,080
a multimillionaire internet character 
that's hiding.

809
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,390
I was going to say,
after he lets the information out,

810
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,600
what is the purpose of killing the guy 
because you're not going to stop the 

811
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,541
inflammation.
What it is is to stop other people from 

812
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,431
doing it because it'll all get creeped 
out by to stop what you're saying here 

813
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:10,150
to stop other people from doing it one 
and two so that he can't testify on the 

814
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:15,611
depth of all the corruption that was 
going on in the DNC and who had 

815
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:16,290
organized it and who had orchestrated 
it.

816
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,160
That's what they think.
But what the fuck who the.

817
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,020
But there's a lot of people that dispute
this.

818
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:26,021
And also there was a redacted FBI report
that people were touting out that turned

819
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:31,421
out to be bullshit.
And so now they found out that that was 

820
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,361
a fraud,
that the FBI report was a bullshit FBI 

821
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:34,361
reports.
So they don't know what the fuck's going

822
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:35,210
on,
but this guy's dead.

823
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,100
So my point is he,
he got whacked whether

824
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,320
or not he got whacked because he was 
working with.

825
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,300
There it is.
Federal prosecutor found dead.

826
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:44,170
This guy got whacked this weekend 
apparently.

827
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,800
Oh,
Jesus will work for.

828
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,360
They'll know exactly yet.
Jesus,

829
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:52,370
you just blew my theory out of the water
and was like a 37 year old federal 

830
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,770
prosecutor went for a jog and south 
beach and uh,

831
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,800
found with a gunshot wound to his head,
I believe.

832
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:57,530
It's like,
well,

833
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,580
he might've fucking put somebody in jail
though.

834
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:00,490
That potentially.
Yeah.

835
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,140
That was pissed off.
And waited for him at all.

836
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,740
To your behaviors.
What?

837
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,430
When you put someone in jail when you.
Yeah,

838
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:10,420
when you have jobs like that.
Oh yeah.

839
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,420
You can't be.
You can't go home the same way.

840
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:13,410
Everything.
But I had a fuck.

841
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:15,610
People live like that.
Yeah.

842
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,720
How do you live with your prosecutor to 
ever get to that level of society?

843
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:27,030
Well,
it's just a intense way of life to your 

844
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,511
work with criminals all the time.
You're constantly working with people 

845
00:36:29,511 --> 00:36:31,881
that are breaking the law.
You're constantly trying to put them 

846
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:31,881
behind bars.
I guess it's freaking me out,

847
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:33,150
dude.
When did you start smoking a pipe?

848
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,690
Oh,
I only have only have done it a couple 

849
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,971
of times.
Steven crowder brought it in for me and 

850
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:40,971
I try.
How is it?

851
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:40,971
It's not bad.
It's not bad.

852
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:42,370
It's not amazing because you got stopped
out.

853
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:43,890
I'll do it right now.
I'll light up for you.

854
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,540
I thought it would be amazing.
That's okay.

855
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:50,460
Both my grand grandfather smoked a pipe,
so I am a uh,

856
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,830
you know,
I like what it looks like.

857
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,960
There's a place,
uh,

858
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,220
on the west side,
the tinderbox then I've been meaning to 

859
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,220
go into that place on Wilshire,
right?

860
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,190
Isn't it?
Yes.

861
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:07,510
I know that's bought is a place over 
there and I've been meaning to go in 

862
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,510
there and take up.

863
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,620
Piped him.
I just,

864
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,800
I don't know.
I just liked,

865
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,380
I liked the smell of it.
This is dead.

866
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:16,680
We got to go in there and throw your 
shirt across the room and starts smoking

867
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:17,730
a pipe.
Well,

868
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:19,880
the why you liked that?
I'll tell you a little bit about efforts

869
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:23,190
to family for people this season.
A frank looking to get his job,

870
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,190
get a job I should say,
after getting fired,

871
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:29,790
and that was some good active listening.
Oh Jesus.

872
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,550
I'm.
Is it,

873
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,520
we'd,
you're putting in there.

874
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,570
It's tobacco.
Inhale.

875
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,940
Do you know?
And you just sort of put it in your 

876
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:40,940
mouth.
Okay.

877
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,070
Just gonna get a little there.
Okay.

878
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,000
Kevin's trying to get his band going.
We got Laura dirt on the show.

879
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,820
Justin Long.
Sam Rockwell.

880
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,890
Haley reinhart.
Debbie dairy berry.

881
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,030
Think I might've been hailed the first 
time tonight.

882
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,310
I thought you did.
I might've.

883
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,290
We'll see how it goes.
David Kempner.

884
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,680
No,
that time I did.

885
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,220
It was a funny guy.
Yeah.

886
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:06,230
He's,
he's one of the silliest people I've 

887
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,230
ever met and I love him.
Yeah,

888
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,230
you guys got a great cast.
Yeah.

889
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,470
Do you like doing a cartoon?
Is it,

890
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,530
is it as satisfying for you was doing 
standup or is it just something 

891
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,260
different that's equally satisfying?
It's just fun.

892
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,220
Just,
you know what my.

893
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:14,880
No,
no,

894
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:15,210
no,
it's,

895
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:15,890
it's,
yeah,

896
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:18,270
the standups.
My first love.

897
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:23,271
So,
but the thing that I love doing is I 

898
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:25,080
love writing for all these other people,
you know.

899
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,670
And I should say we,
when we write for them,

900
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:31,671
because everybody's in the room and the 
biggest thrill I get is at the table 

901
00:38:31,671 --> 00:38:33,050
read beyond making,
you know,

902
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,160
the powers that be laugh when the actors
crack

903
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,160
up and they can't get through the line.
Like we got mo collins this year a 

904
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,280
couple of times that she's just a,
she's a beast man.

905
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:45,190
She's just does so many characters for 
us.

906
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:47,950
And a couple times like,
it's just one of those things like,

907
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,150
man,
we're making mole laugh.

908
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:52,440
Like I know this is a good line.
And um,

909
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,370
we,
we got those guys.

910
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:59,550
Trevor Deval is another guy.
We got him one time and collectors hard 

911
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,150
to get to laugh though.
He's such a pro,

912
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,620
you know what I mean?
And he'll say afterwards,

913
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:04,000
this is some of the funniest shit I've 
ever done.

914
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:08,440
But he to get him kind of a kind of a 
goal of mine to get them to crack.

915
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:13,470
Yep.
I've been in the booth with Laura and 

916
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,200
we've gotten her a number of times and 
uh,

917
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,160
yeah,
it's uh,

918
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,500
Sam Rockwell.
We've gotten them left.

919
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,980
I just love,
that's my favorite.

920
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,350
My favorite,
it's like making another comedian left.

921
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,170
It's an extra level of like,
all right,

922
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,700
you know,
especially,

923
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,570
you know,
a lot of them,

924
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,570
the caliber of actors that,
the material that they've looked at.

925
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,430
So for them to say,
and he can tell,

926
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:31,600
you know,
anybody can say,

927
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:32,500
oh my God,
this is great.

928
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:35,470
But when you really make them laugh,
you can't fake that.

929
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,610
Um,
so I,

930
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,700
I read the table reads of fun because I 
think that's more like a standup show 

931
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:47,100
and um,
I really rehearsed my lines and I make 

932
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,100
sure that I,
you know,

933
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,350
I sell the shit out of him because uh,
I don't have to go back and fix them,

934
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,410
you know,
if they don't work at the table reading,

935
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:56,050
that's something that I did accidentally
early in my career.

936
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,580
And then I learned what a,
um,

937
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,000
you know,
I learned what a big thing that is,

938
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:07,001
like the first acting gig that I got,
I was doing some small movie or 

939
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:07,001
something.

940
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:10,260
They had a table read and I got there 
and I was overly prepared and the lines 

941
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,200
worked.
And then there was more stuff for me.

942
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,490
And this guy said,
hey man,

943
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:17,491
the writers love you man,
you just selling the shit out of your 

944
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:19,591
stuff.
And I'm thinking my head as I was just 

945
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:19,591
trying not to get fired.
And then I,

946
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:22,410
then I was able to see how the game 
works because there's,

947
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,330
there's actors that will go to a table 
reading if they don't like the material,

948
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:30,331
they don't sell the stuff and the,
I don't think they understand how hard 

949
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,380
people work.
So at least give it a fucking yes.

950
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,260
Swing out of your cleat,
see what happens,

951
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:40,290
you know what I mean?
But to go there and just sort of mumble 

952
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:40,290
your way through it,
the that's,

953
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:45,060
it's not a good position to get yourself
into as an actor of the whole writing 

954
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,060
room.
Writer's room was like,

955
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,060
Oh

956
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,790
fuck this guy.
Yeah.

957
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:50,960
It wasn't that an issue on what was that
girl on one of those cop shows,

958
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,090
not cop shows.
One of those hospital shows,

959
00:40:53,091 --> 00:40:58,091
grey's anatomy was that girl said she 
wanted to be removed from consideration 

960
00:40:58,091 --> 00:41:02,290
for,
for the Emmy's because she didn't think 

961
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:02,290
the material is strong enough that year.
And they were like,

962
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:02,650
Oh,
what?

963
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,220
Oh God,
this fly.

964
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,650
No.
And,

965
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,020
and how,
how writers?

966
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:11,340
Yeah.
Command their money is through winning 

967
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:11,340
shit like that.
Yeah.

968
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,040
Obviously it had been on a hit show,
but if you're an emmy award winning 

969
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,040
writer,
that's huge for that.

970
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,580
That's like their fucking hbo special.
So to screw.

971
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,580
If they're gonna get.
They were nominated and she said,

972
00:41:19,581 --> 00:41:21,740
I want to take that back.
We didn't want to be.

973
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,390
She didn't want to be nominated.
Here it is.

974
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:28,540
Star shuns Emmy's.
Katherine Heigl this week said she had 

975
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,541
opted out of the Emmy's racist here 
because she was not given good enough 

976
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:35,231
material to work with last season that,
that fucking 29 years old on top of the 

977
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:40,040
fucking world just disappear and up your
own fucking vagina.

978
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,410
Back to that real quick.
So that was.

979
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,060
I don't.
That is exactly.

980
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,500
She's still working.
Not really,

981
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:50,590
no.
She dropped off the face of the planet 

982
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:50,590
10 years ago.
She was a big star.

983
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,180
She started doing movies.
She did that movie with Seth.

984
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,900
Does she know she's fucking dropped off 
the face of the planet now she's 40 and 

985
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,540
38.
Let's be honest here.

986
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:05,270
She's 38.
Well basically 10 years ago,

987
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,750
40 years.
30 eight mean I'm 49.

988
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:09,620
I'm 50.
Trust me.

989
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:17,830
That's what happens though.
That 10 years flies by and nobody wants 

990
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,410
to do shit with you anymore and now 
she's got a tainted word.

991
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,390
She's got a tainted name.
Yeah.

992
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:26,470
Oh yeah.
She's apparently softened their stance 

993
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:26,470
and she's,
you know,

994
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,250
apologized for her,
her youthful exuberance.

995
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,580
But Hey,
we're dumb.

996
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,290
She the twenties with dump.
Yeah.

997
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:33,300
I give her a pass.
Thomas.

998
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,080
Fuck yeah.
I give a passport girl.

999
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,060
Good for you.
What are you going to do?

1000
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:39,370
Dumb shit in your twenties.
That's pretty dumb though.

1001
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,740
Huh?
That's pretty dumped.

1002
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:45,741
That's ferocious.
I can beat that with a few things in my 

1003
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:45,741
twenties.

1004
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:45,770
Don't you think?
That's not like a rash decision.

1005
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:49,130
That's something that was thought over.
Decided,

1006
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,800
reinforced.
Said it more than one time and then.

1007
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:58,090
But there's a certain level of like not 
only ego mania was celebrity with Asos,

1008
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:03,100
so paranoia and I think that like you 
just fucking did all squirrels together 

1009
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:06,720
in your head and like,
you know,

1010
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,000
like maybe her thinking about an old 
acting,

1011
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:10,860
am I doing the work?
He says,

1012
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,620
he says worthy.
He got that fucking going on.

1013
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,640
If you're just remotely a pleasant 
person when you get to a certain level 

1014
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,441
of fame,
people just like you are just the most 

1015
00:43:24,441 --> 00:43:26,811
amazing.
Like I sneezed and you said God bless 

1016
00:43:26,811 --> 00:43:30,651
you.
I mean he is so down to earth like the 

1017
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:33,051
level that you have to just fucking 
barely even be a fucking decent human 

1018
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:34,320
being to just get this avalanche of 
compliments.

1019
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,950
If you got that going on and then you 
got this fucking paranoia thing,

1020
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:41,040
like a is this to move?
This is what I wanted.

1021
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,840
Is this what I want to hang my hat on 
with this man?

1022
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:48,860
You just start fucking heaven.
Your own inside the actor's studio with 

1023
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,860
yourself.
I think it's just a diss on the writers.

1024
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:55,070
That's what I would say.
I would say what she's doing is dissing 

1025
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:55,070
the writers.
She's just saying when your world,

1026
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:55,260
it's a sketch.
For me,

1027
00:43:55,261 --> 00:43:55,870
it was a,
uh,

1028
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,890
it was a trilogy of a movie.
I was really going somewhere with 

1029
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:00,890
trilogy three,
three parter.

1030
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,140
I was just joking how I built it all up 
in her head.

1031
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:03,720
And you're just like,
yeah,

1032
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:08,721
I think you're just being a cunt.
They call them all brass tacks.

1033
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,870
Rogan just gets right down to it.

1034
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,460
That is my method.
I'm more of a bro.

1035
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,580
I'm not really.
I'm not grounded.

1036
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:18,270
Pumped.
You grounded,

1037
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:20,520
pounded.
Don't feel them out in the first round.

1038
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:23,220
You take them right down.
Back when it comes to people like that.

1039
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,080
I've seen that before.
I know what that is.

1040
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:26,760
You go double leg take down and then 
that's it.

1041
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,050
Especially with the actors.
I've,

1042
00:44:29,051 --> 00:44:30,810
I've,
I mean I've met a lot of Nice actors,

1043
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:34,440
don't me wrong,
but maybe it's fifth 50 percent of them.

1044
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:39,620
That's a bad number.
Like 50 percent of actors are pretty 

1045
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:39,620
fucked up.

1046
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,640
But you worked.
You worked back when they could be a 

1047
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:42,640
Douche.
That's true.

1048
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,360
Now you can't.
That's right.

1049
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,680
Now you can't.
Yeah.

1050
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,350
People tell.
Yeah,

1051
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:46,830
no,
no,

1052
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:51,831
it's,
it's just because everybody's stole all 

1053
00:44:51,831 --> 00:44:52,950
the movies and they stole all the music.
You know,

1054
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:57,951
there's people like weasel.
The good music was born during the 

1055
00:44:57,951 --> 00:44:57,951
grunge era.
It's like,

1056
00:44:57,951 --> 00:45:01,371
well,
if this model existed back then you 

1057
00:45:01,371 --> 00:45:01,371
would have ruined that too because you 
don't pay for anything.

1058
00:45:01,371 --> 00:45:03,060
So you get what you pay for it.
You get shitty movies,

1059
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:04,980
you know,
about superheroes and all that.

1060
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:08,820
So now that's what it is.
It's going to be superheroes or uh,

1061
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:10,260
you know,
some sort of whatever.

1062
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,010
Fucking,
oh my God.

1063
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:14,980
Am I 40 now?
One of those comedies and um,

1064
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,550
yeah,
what the fuck was my point?

1065
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,600
What were you going to pay for anything 
anymore made it,

1066
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,820
that's what I made.

1067
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,590
And that wasn't your thing.
I was talking about,

1068
00:45:23,591 --> 00:45:28,591
oh,
you can't be a Dushan out because the 

1069
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:28,591
work is dried up.
There's not as many of them.

1070
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:32,151
That's why this like,
like all these stars pilot on like the 

1071
00:45:32,151 --> 00:45:36,560
Golden State Warriors.
Every movie back in the day like to to 

1072
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,450
make Ocean's 11 happened when all of 
those people could have had their own 

1073
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,230
starring vehicle and make all of this 
fucking money.

1074
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:41,460
God,
I hope I'm right on this one.

1075
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:48,170
You mean the original oceans 11 now.
Even though even the one when i.

1076
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,240
The few times I did movies,
everybody told me you just missed it.

1077
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,000
You fucking missed it at all.
Ended in Oh,

1078
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:54,720
five.
Oh six.

1079
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:56,670
And I started getting work in like 
fucking oh nine,

1080
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,530
2010.
They were like,

1081
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,140
oh my God,
they'd fucking pay for John Travolta.

1082
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:06,141
Is jet fuel in his own fucking to do 
like one of those hogs movies?

1083
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,240
Like riding on a motorcycle?
He the okay,

1084
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:11,670
you got to pay for my 7:47
and I got chuck.

1085
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,730
Chuck goes without saying it goes 
without saying.

1086
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:19,740
I'm going to fly back and forth from the
set on the weekend and my own 7:47,

1087
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,140
12 hour apps.
Whatever you want.

1088
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:25,040
We'll build a fucking airfield for you 
right next to them.

1089
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:27,090
When we do stay alive,
we'll fucking do like,

1090
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:32,510
like when you hear something,
I mean I'm obviously exaggerating to a 

1091
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:32,510
certain level,
but like some of the,

1092
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:36,500
the,
the budgets that were around in the way 

1093
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,530
that they burned through fucking money 
and I'm now it all just,

1094
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,940
it's like it's the Serengeti during the 
dry seasons and all the fucking lines of

1095
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:44,370
fucking everybody's drinking next to 
each other.

1096
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:49,371
So don't they still make big movies now?
I mean don't all these like a 

1097
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:50,460
blockbuster.
They still make no,

1098
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:53,460
but if you notice,
but this like it's not just a Tom cruise

1099
00:46:53,461 --> 00:46:55,020
movie.
There'll be like fucking all these other

1100
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:58,680
people pile like those superhero movies,
this like this.

1101
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,220
There's someone who used to be able to 
carry a movie in each slot.

1102
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:07,260
Right.
I'm not saying they still don't get 

1103
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:07,260
movies.
It's just like just just dried up and I,

1104
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:07,470
this people in the industry told me

1105
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:10,670
men in black,
three star will smith forced the moon.

1106
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,860
Forced to move is huge.
$2,000,000

1107
00:47:12,861 --> 00:47:17,861
trailer as New York residents complain 
that trailer as Jim just for working 

1108
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:19,880
out.
That's just as Jim.

1109
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:24,881
Yeah,
he had another trailer to holy shit 

1110
00:47:24,881 --> 00:47:27,161
hanging out or whatever.
Kevin James had a trailer just for 

1111
00:47:27,161 --> 00:47:27,320
working out.
When we did a zookeeper together.

1112
00:47:27,321 --> 00:47:29,980
He had a full gym in a trailer that you 
rent.

1113
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,800
I mean it was a full.
It had a fucking tanning booths in it.

1114
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,600
That was one.
Here comes the boom,

1115
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:40,020
here comes the boom.
He had to get in shape because he was 

1116
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,020
playing a us,
a guy who became a UFC fighter.

1117
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,050
Yeah,
he did a great job.

1118
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:41,620
Yeah,
he did.

1119
00:47:41,621 --> 00:47:46,621
He lost a Shitload of weight to start 
drinking Kale shakes in the morning and 

1120
00:47:46,621 --> 00:47:48,070
working out constantly,
so we had a full gym.

1121
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:53,071
Nothing will get you in shape like 
knowing you how you're gonna have to 

1122
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:54,520
take your shirt off in a movie that will
motivate you.

1123
00:47:54,521 --> 00:47:56,740
Like fuck,
this definitely helped me.

1124
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:58,560
All the green shit you got.
I'll drink it.

1125
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,300
I will fucking drink that.
If you could somehow,

1126
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:06,990
if there was an app that you listened to
when you were asleep and it convinced 

1127
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,020
you that you were going to have to take 
your shirt off in a movie,

1128
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:10,240
like the level of shape that Americans 
would get into.

1129
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,210
I think it would be crazy.
Do you.

1130
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:17,230
What about Bert Kreischer?
Bert Kreischer is a rare animal.

1131
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,280
He's like a white tiger.
Very valuable.

1132
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,800
Like an albino deer.
Like if you ever get to the level,

1133
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:28,801
if you get bored with just,
you know when you want to go for the 

1134
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:30,991
ultimate prey,
like that's the head you want on your 

1135
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:30,991
wall crisis.

1136
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,160
Bert is like A.
Yeah,

1137
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,810
he has A.
I don't know.

1138
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:40,690
I don't know how he's wired,
but like a.

1139
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:41,840
He does not.
I,

1140
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:44,550
I,
I would love to add that.

1141
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,290
You'd have to ask him that.
Ask Him Bert,

1142
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,510
what humiliate you.
Like he like,

1143
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:56,560
dude,
that dude is really just like fearless 

1144
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:56,560
was definitely fearless in taking the 
shirt off.

1145
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,490
Takes his shirt off every show.
Like immediately takes his shirt off and

1146
00:48:59,491 --> 00:49:04,070
the push back as a fucking chaps on 
chaps ate.

1147
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,830
Did that at the Goddamn comedy jam?
No,

1148
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:07,390
he came.
I remember I had a follow up.

1149
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:11,500
He went out and he fucking did a red hot
chili peppers.

1150
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:14,470
Give it away now and came out with just 
a sock on his junk.

1151
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:18,850
It convinced everyone else in the band 
to do it and they did it.

1152
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,730
Most of them didn't want to do it.
He just.

1153
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,690
He's fucking burt.
He let them over the hill,

1154
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:27,691
like in braveheart.
They all walked out with this socks and 

1155
00:49:27,691 --> 00:49:30,391
I'm sitting there like the fuck am I 
going to follow this and what did you 

1156
00:49:30,391 --> 00:49:31,000
have to say?
Why don't you play the drums?

1157
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,100
I played drums.
We can't go wrong though,

1158
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:34,690
and you're.
You're back there with the drums.

1159
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:38,080
You could follow that.
It's not the same a dude.

1160
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:41,080
You're talking to the level of energy 
and the level of the crowd being like,

1161
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:46,081
dude,
what the fuck show is over to the show.

1162
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,560
The show is over.
Why did they have him go last?

1163
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,700
I think that's the exact question I 
asked Josh.

1164
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:58,960
Adam Meyers who also does expose also 
does a voice on how when Hank,

1165
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:01,720
the Dj had the,
where he came up with a DJ character.

1166
00:50:01,721 --> 00:50:03,490
I'm like,
I got the guy with the perfect voice.

1167
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,340
Um,
but uh,

1168
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,310
yeah,
I,

1169
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:09,120
I don't know why I should have been 
going on la.

1170
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,030
I think it's like they,
they view that show more like,

1171
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,750
how many years have you been doing 
standup?

1172
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:14,710
It's like,
no,

1173
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:19,711
this is not a standup to save music show
who has the most musical ability or like

1174
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,350
it's going to make the crowd go the 
craziest.

1175
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:24,030
I mean,
come on dude.

1176
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:28,160
Even if you didn't know anything about 
show business guys with these

1177
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,370
guys are going to come out with nothing 
but socks on their dicks.

1178
00:50:30,371 --> 00:50:31,690
That's,
that's going last,

1179
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:32,750
right?
Yeah,

1180
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,620
that's,
that's it.

1181
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,450
So that's what I would say if I was 
scheduling it.

1182
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,620
I can't remember

1183
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,210
what.
I did have two that play the drums.

1184
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,980
Why did some stuff I did enough standup 
to try and make them forget about what 

1185
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:45,110
they saw before that.
But I don't remember what song I played.

1186
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:50,140
So that show us.
Stand up to what you can do little 

1187
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:50,140
standup as well with the way it started 
out,

1188
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:54,911
which you would come out and just talk 
about how much you loved music and then 

1189
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:57,461
you talk about the awful bands you 
played in or some of the concert you 

1190
00:50:57,461 --> 00:50:59,270
went to or a.
I'm a rockstar that they meant something

1191
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:00,250
to you.
And,

1192
00:51:00,251 --> 00:51:01,820
and what,
what,

1193
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,920
what inspired the Doula?
There you go.

1194
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:07,280
That's me being trying to be Steven 
Adler Tattoo the tattoo.

1195
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:10,880
Um,
so I probably played either.

1196
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,130
Welcome to the jungle of Paradise City 
on that one.

1197
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,020
Uh,
it's funny shit dude.

1198
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:20,021
And that's the reason why I dress up 
like the drummers is because I don't 

1199
00:51:20,021 --> 00:51:20,021
want people to think that,
you know,

1200
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:21,980
I played drums good enough where people 
will be like,

1201
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:23,390
wait,
does this guy think he's good?

1202
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:25,580
Yeah,
there you go.

1203
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:31,730
He's trying to find the socks.
That was before the weight loss 

1204
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:32,670
challenge to.
Yup.

1205
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:34,890
He put most of that weight back on 
though.

1206
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,860
Tommy didn't.
I went to Tommy's house the other day to

1207
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,200
do his podcasts.
He looks fucking great.

1208
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,990
He's lost more weight.
Oh yeah.

1209
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:47,010
He's disciplined now.
They see us exercising constantly,

1210
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,950
eerily quiet sometimes.
When you stand next to Tom?

1211
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,480
Yes.
Really?

1212
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,640
Yeah.
I just peer into his head sometimes like

1213
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:55,290
what's going on in there?
What do you say?

1214
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,250
What is.
I don't know.

1215
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:02,930
I don't know if this I love top,
but I'm telling you these just have it 

1216
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:06,471
in there.
I would love to bring them on here and 

1217
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:06,471
interview him.
Well,

1218
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:06,810
he's definitely intense.
He's.

1219
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:12,610
He doesn't show a lot of people like the
way he prepared for this weight loss 

1220
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:13,250
challenge.
How am I dark dude and I,

1221
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,570
I when I go into a room and you can see 
if you're a psycho,

1222
00:52:15,571 --> 00:52:17,610
you spot another cycle and there's just 
like this.

1223
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:21,180
There's a fucking movie going on there 
that I would love to finance.

1224
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,100
I want to see that movie made

1225
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:33,530
him and his wife.
I think that's the funniest comedy 

1226
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:35,841
couple next to Moshe Kasher,
like that's like Moshe Kasher and his 

1227
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:39,210
wife a Natasha Leggiero.
Those two.

1228
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:44,420
And then Tommy bonds and Christina.
I kind of go with Tommy and Christina.

1229
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,460
They're closed.
I'm seeing a new reality show.

1230
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:50,510
It's close comedy couples,
couples,

1231
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,640
chicken and.
Oh yeah,

1232
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,130
last comic standing with comic meets the
newlywed game.

1233
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,450
Huh?
That's how you.

1234
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:03,590
That's all you have to do to pitch.
You just pitched to shows that worked 

1235
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:03,720
the newlywed game and last comic 
standing.

1236
00:53:03,721 --> 00:53:08,721
Yeah.
You ask them questions and all of that 

1237
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:08,721
stuff.
Who else is out there?

1238
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:09,060
You've got Tom Cotter and Carrie Luis.

1239
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,650
Right.
Okay.

1240
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,910
I'm just saying convenience.
I'm okay.

1241
00:53:15,911 --> 00:53:18,730
It's one season mcfarlane and rich vos 
bottoming,

1242
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:23,920
which their banders that's there in the 
running as well for the funniest couple.

1243
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:25,350
Who else?
Well,

1244
00:53:25,351 --> 00:53:26,010
how do you keep this

1245
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,480
going,
Joe?

1246
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,370
I don't have this going for five seats.
You don't.

1247
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,680
You barely can get three episodes.
It is special.

1248
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,230
This is something you would learn your 
name to know.

1249
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,870
Could this live where we're where we're 
just trying to get a check.

1250
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,990
I just want to sell it to you and then 
run away.

1251
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,210
I like it.
Well listen,

1252
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,500
we just got business with a liquid 
draino and they want to get into the 

1253
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,510
streaming business and they got all 
kinds of money.

1254
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:50,460
They know they're going to lose money in
this first year,

1255
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:52,560
so we'll give you.
We'll just go throw money at you.

1256
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:53,490
Okay.
I have one request.

1257
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,260
What's that?
Mario Lopez host.

1258
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,360
Mario Lopez.
Can we get them that we know him?

1259
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,560
Yes.
What does he do?

1260
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,300
He's a boxer.
Myra Lopez.

1261
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,520
He wasn't on saved by the bell.
Did that too,

1262
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:05,160
but now entertainment reporter slash 
boxer.

1263
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,330
Oh,
and he's a boxer.

1264
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,620
Yeah.
Now the guys read it.

1265
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,720
Good looking guy.
And he hosted.

1266
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,790
Yes.
There you go.

1267
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,540
So like the women are married to a God.
It's not as good looking as Mario.

1268
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:16,800
And that's part of the drama.
The show.

1269
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,580
What do you think?
Which is where does this live?

1270
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,310
Bravo for sure.
I was just picturing the industry,

1271
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:24,420
like whenever you don't know what to 
say,

1272
00:54:24,421 --> 00:54:25,380
you just go,
where does this live?

1273
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,820
Is this in our Palette?
You know what I been watching lately?

1274
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:34,930
This fucking ridiculously addictive and 
some fucked up way is million dollar 

1275
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:37,200
listing.
Ever watched that show?

1276
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:37,950
Do you know what it is?
Is.

1277
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,310
So gay guys are selling houses.
Yes.

1278
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,610
My wife Watches that Shell with that 
fucking.

1279
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:49,770
The Gay Guy Lives in Connecticut.
So ridiculous.

1280
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:53,160
So t he looks like he's like claymation,
he doesn't look like a real person.

1281
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:54,720
He's so light.

1282
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,290
I am the number one real estate agent 
and all of New York.

1283
00:54:58,350 --> 00:54:59,820
I liked,
I liked he best.

1284
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,950
I love that guy.
And I know when he starts speaking,

1285
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,120
what is.
He speaks Swedish and out of nowhere.

1286
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,540
He just was not the guy.
That's not him.

1287
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:07,380
That's not him.
No,

1288
00:55:07,381 --> 00:55:09,170
that's,
that's the one from new.

1289
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,590
No,
that's the other one.

1290
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,840
The one of the things.
You got it right guy,

1291
00:55:12,841 --> 00:55:17,841
that guy fucking guy.
He is of the one of the little metal 

1292
00:55:17,841 --> 00:55:17,841
looks a lot like,
um,

1293
00:55:17,841 --> 00:55:17,850
God.
That's weird.

1294
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,250
They all,
they're all have on lipstick.

1295
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,330
They look exactly the same million 
dollar listing Los Angeles.

1296
00:55:24,331 --> 00:55:26,250
That's the different one.
Yeah,

1297
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:30,480
the one in New York,
one of the greatest fucking gay dude.

1298
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,590
I love that guy.

1299
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,510
So the guy in the middle is.
I haven't seen that guy before.

1300
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:39,270
I've only seen the one in New York with 
a male model in the middle.

1301
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:42,690
There's a middle one on the right is an 
angry psycho like me.

1302
00:55:42,691 --> 00:55:47,691
The dude in the middle is sort of a 
middle ground and then the other guy is 

1303
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:48,060
like,
I mean he's right out of Hogan's heroes.

1304
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:51,360
There was a house that they were selling
in Los Angeles that was on that show and

1305
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:54,240
I was watching it and they were trying 
to sell it for $20,000,000

1306
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:57,660
and it was for sale recently.
Stood out was actually a house.

1307
00:55:57,661 --> 00:56:00,930
It's really for sale but it's like right
above sunset strip.

1308
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:03,000
Like you could see it from the strip,
like you mentioned,

1309
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:05,550
buying a $20,000,000
house and you could just look at it like

1310
00:56:05,551 --> 00:56:10,551
you can look into the windows.
I mean it's a half a block above the 

1311
00:56:10,551 --> 00:56:10,551
strip.

1312
00:56:10,551 --> 00:56:12,180
You looking out your window like a cvs 
is across the street?

1313
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:13,900
No.
Yeah,

1314
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:14,860
that's what.
Okay.

1315
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,160
I just thought you were.
But it is like that.

1316
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,910
I mean it's stair steps above it.
It's here's the strip,

1317
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:25,911
here's sunset strip.
Here's the first couple of buildings is 

1318
00:56:25,911 --> 00:56:25,911
right there.
I mean it's fucking right there,

1319
00:56:25,911 --> 00:56:27,270
but it's true.
They want $20,000,000

1320
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,280
from and the listings.
You believe that those are true because 

1321
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,960
like the last episode I watched is the,
uh,

1322
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,620
the Gay Gestapo guy is sitting there 
going,

1323
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:43,000
he walks in to this lady and he just 
goes,

1324
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:44,590
okay,
here's the off.

1325
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:49,660
Our final offer that could give you is 
11 point $3,000,000.

1326
00:56:49,691 --> 00:56:51,640
And then she just said that one,
she read them the riot.

1327
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:52,860
I told you,
negotiation,

1328
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:54,460
waste my fucking time,
blah,

1329
00:56:54,461 --> 00:56:55,660
blah blah.
And he's just sitting there going like,

1330
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:56,770
oh my God.
Oh my God.

1331
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:57,240
You know?

1332
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:02,910
And I was,
I was surprised he took that level of 

1333
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:03,280
shit.
I was waiting for me like,

1334
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:04,620
lady,
I stepped my fault.

1335
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:07,700
You think it's worth $50,
million dollars to fucking lunatic?

1336
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:12,710
I can't do that.
So he just sits there and listens and 

1337
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:12,710
then she leaves and I'm like,
Holy Shit.

1338
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:14,950
They finally didn't sell a house.
And then just boom,

1339
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,940
two seconds later somebody calls up.
Oh,

1340
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,000
after,
after he does the whole,

1341
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,420
she walked out the door.
It was like winter in Russia,

1342
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,600
right?
Fuck it.

1343
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:28,570
All of a sudden somebody calls up out of
nowhere and just goes,

1344
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:29,530
all right,
11,

1345
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,440
six final offer.
That's it,

1346
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:34,600
and then he calls the lady up and then 
she's all just like,

1347
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,370
see,
that's all I wanted.

1348
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,170
Yeah,
that's exact show I watched.

1349
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:39,930
Yeah,
and that was.

1350
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,080
That was too easy and there's the 
handsome model.

1351
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:45,430
He just takes the shirt off all the time
and he just ripped that guy with the.

1352
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:47,890
The fellow with the light.
My wife likes him.

1353
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:50,590
Of course she does know women like them.
Guys shredded.

1354
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,660
Yeah.
I'll kick it back to data for man.

1355
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:56,680
She could literally be like,
I'm leaving you for him.

1356
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:57,880
And I'd be like,
I get that.

1357
00:57:57,881 --> 00:57:58,990
I get it.
I see it.

1358
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:01,570
You gotta do what you gotta do go good 
for you,

1359
00:58:01,571 --> 00:58:03,080
man.
Congratulations.

1360
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,810
Give me some knuckles.
Hey,

1361
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:05,830
at least we had a kid together.

1362
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:11,770
Magic magic is taking custody to always 
a better looking dad.

1363
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:14,790
He's probably better at it than me.
Yeah,

1364
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,500
it's,
it's tough to fight that off.

1365
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,800
It was about six to shredded and he 
keeps a certain mount chest hair on it 

1366
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,260
to you really analyze this guy to 
fucking not.

1367
00:58:26,261 --> 00:58:31,261
I usually I got my little glass of 
fucking whatever I'm drinking at that 

1368
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:31,261
point.
You know,

1369
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,720
my little helper to get me to sleep.
What do you drink a dude?

1370
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:37,440
I drink gasoline.
Gas.

1371
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,200
How often do you drink it?
Oh,

1372
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:42,640
because you took a long time off,
right?

1373
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:44,680
Didn't you take like a few months 
periods?

1374
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:49,770
Uh,
I'm in the middle of a Joe Dimaggio 

1375
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:49,770
streak right now.
I didn't drink last night,

1376
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:54,211
but I had family come in a two weekends 
this month to meet my daughter and uh,

1377
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:56,880
so like that was a lot of like,
you know,

1378
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,510
beer,
drinking them.

1379
00:58:58,511 --> 00:58:59,960
It's just,
you know,

1380
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:05,070
booze and whatever.
Like I feel I'm being good if I drink 

1381
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:06,460
hard stuff because it's not as many 
calories is beer.

1382
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,710
But um,
yeah,

1383
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:13,800
I've been on a wine street,
clearly drinking with the dementia 

1384
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:13,800
teeth.
Gray.

1385
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,520
I hate that.
Then you're sitting there,

1386
00:59:14,521 --> 00:59:15,940
you could drink red wine.
It turns it gray.

1387
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:16,760
Then you're like,
ah,

1388
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,780
I drink so much coffee.
My teeth had kind of jacked anyway.

1389
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,260
Oh,
they're going a little yellow.

1390
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,450
Yeah,
I,

1391
00:59:22,451 --> 00:59:24,080
I definitely,
uh,

1392
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:26,210
don't know.
I definitely,

1393
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:27,790
yeah,
I go through peers.

1394
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:32,791
I got inspired recently because I read 
something about some celebrity that 

1395
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:34,820
fucker was already good looking and then
they just laid off the booze being like,

1396
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:39,821
yeah,
I kind of was going too hard and the 

1397
00:59:39,821 --> 00:59:39,821
dude was even better looking.
I was just like,

1398
00:59:39,821 --> 00:59:40,040
yeah,
I got to cut this out.

1399
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:44,270
I gotta knock this off so this is going 
to make it better looking.

1400
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:45,770
You know,
it's gonna.

1401
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:49,430
It's gonna make you a better looking 
you.

1402
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:54,940
How's that?
Because you fucking poor and that Shit 

1403
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,761
idiots not good for you.
It's like you're literally asking me 

1404
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:57,950
like if you live a healthier lifestyle,
you got to look a little better.

1405
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,910
Thirty feet and moon pies and fucking 
drinking beer and stuff,

1406
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:02,690
you're going to look horrible.

1407
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:07,110
Would you rather enjoy yourself or look 
better?

1408
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,530
Oh Dude.
I literally was thinking that last night

1409
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,450
when I was sitting there going like,
all right,

1410
01:00:11,451 --> 01:00:13,700
I'm not drinking tonight.
I'm not going to have that little one.

1411
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:15,590
And uh,
you know,

1412
01:00:15,591 --> 01:00:18,530
my wife always see I can walk in and she
hears the ice in the glass before I even

1413
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,530
get down the hall.
And I'm giving you a hard time.

1414
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,060
Oh,
another one.

1415
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:24,380
No,
no,

1416
01:00:24,381 --> 01:00:24,920
no.
She just,

1417
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:28,250
she doesn't.
Don't need Jeremy Sober.

1418
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,950
No,
she's more like Christ.

1419
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,930
You're going to be fucking snoring all 
night.

1420
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,270
Now we have cheating off.
My wife's always this.

1421
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:38,390
I'll always be like,
oh my God,

1422
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:39,860
I think I'm a fucking alcoholic.
She's like,

1423
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:42,650
you're not an alcoholic.
You're so fucking dramatic.

1424
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:44,270
He just liked to drink.
It's like,

1425
01:00:44,271 --> 01:00:44,990
all right,
you're right.

1426
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:48,540
But um,
we did have this whole fucking thing was

1427
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:50,840
she just like,
I'd come walking in with a drink and she

1428
01:00:50,841 --> 01:00:55,841
just spelled last year when we were 
doing the show and just the stress of 

1429
01:00:55,841 --> 01:00:56,870
writing and just thinking all day and 
coming home.

1430
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:59,510
But I was like really fucking hitting it
a little harder.

1431
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:04,870
So I come into the room and she was 
looking at my pores and they went from 

1432
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:04,870
this to this,
this is getting bigger.

1433
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,230
And then one night came walking in and 
she just goes,

1434
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:11,530
Jesus Christ,
why don't you just bring the whole 

1435
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:11,530
bottle?
They're like,

1436
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:14,731
I only had one fucking thing is huge.
And I,

1437
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:16,100
that's what I came up.
I go,

1438
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,780
I go,
it's a home for a home,

1439
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:20,940
a home for.
Oh well you like,

1440
01:01:20,941 --> 01:01:22,940
you need to go out to like the fucking,
uh,

1441
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:23,920
the,
the,

1442
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,080
the whiskey bars and shit,
and they take like an eyedropper out.

1443
01:01:27,081 --> 01:01:30,020
They have like a giant,
like glacier fucking ice cube in there.

1444
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:31,040
And then they just,
you know,

1445
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,690
little wet,
your whistle shot,

1446
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:37,700
you just,
it doesn't even go up like an eighth of 

1447
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:37,700
the ice cube.
Um,

1448
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:38,330
that's,
that's like a,

1449
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,240
that's a commercial poor.
And then you've got the home pour,

1450
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:44,270
which is me,
is you cover the ice cube,

1451
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:47,210
he get one of those big square ones in 
there,

1452
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,670
you know,
and he just

1453
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:55,020
pour over it.
I got a buddy that takes us to the next 

1454
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:55,020
level.
He takes a smoker,

1455
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:58,510
he puts water in the smoker,
so he leaves it in there for like a half

1456
01:01:58,511 --> 01:02:00,670
an hour.
So the smoke embeds the water,

1457
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,880
then he takes the water out of the 
smoker and pours it into this circular 

1458
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,330
cube maker circular,
uh,

1459
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:08,180
ice ball maker.
No,

1460
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,100
you pour it,
pour it in there.

1461
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:14,101
So it's smokey water.
And then he drops that in a class and 

1462
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:15,310
pauses whiskey over the smoke infused 
water.

1463
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:18,220
That too much.
It's a little redundant.

1464
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:18,970
A little too.

1465
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,860
That's like that band striper.
Remember them all.

1466
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,140
There were the Christian band member all
the stripes.

1467
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,590
Like they just took it too far that 
everything was fucking striped.

1468
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,950
One thing like Super Christian,
that guy's whole fucking drum kit.

1469
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:36,380
Like the symbol stands were all yellow 
and black striped as too much tech.

1470
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:39,080
We get it.
You or you can I,

1471
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:44,950
I'm not aware of these guys.
That is disgusting.

1472
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,790
That is yellow and black.
That's what I think.

1473
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:49,740
Having a smoke confused,
uh,

1474
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,440
it's already going to be.
Have a PD taste to it?

1475
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:57,610
No.
Am I wrong about them being the 

1476
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:57,610
Christian band?
No.

1477
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:57,610
No.
You're right.

1478
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:59,190
They are.
The drummer's name was Robert.

1479
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:00,780
Sweet.
I remember that.

1480
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,420
And that was actually,
I don't think that's a stage name.

1481
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:06,300
That's how I say I have no idea.
Five,

1482
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:09,450
three point five.
They have a quote in the back.

1483
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,630
That's hilarious.
They hit,

1484
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:15,730
they hit.
They just the market.

1485
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,310
Why Ted Cruz?
Oh,

1486
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:22,311
that guy fixture of Ted Cruz.
And the guy,

1487
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,970
it does look like Ted Cruz has a peewee 
Herman haircut too.

1488
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:28,020
Right there.
It does.

1489
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:29,460
A little bit.
A Little Bob's big boy.

1490
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:31,290
Little cough going on there.
I mean I should talk.

1491
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,090
I'd be happy with him as president right
now.

1492
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:35,800
I'd be happier.
Would you?

1493
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:40,830
Would you not be.
He creeped me out bidding more than 

1494
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:40,830
trump.
Yeah.

1495
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:42,090
I voted.
I voted for Gary Johnson.

1496
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,500
I did too.
I liked that guy.

1497
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:48,620
He just was.
He just was saying that's all he was 

1498
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,050
looking for at that point.
And I like Bernie Sanders too.

1499
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:50,970
I would have loved to see those two guys
go at it.

1500
01:03:50,971 --> 01:03:53,930
I just think we would have been in a 
much better place.

1501
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,530
A more sense.
Yeah.

1502
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:56,970
It just got a little too.
Uh,

1503
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:03,160
we,
you know what going on with this Russia 

1504
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:03,160
shit.

1505
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:03,160
I don't give a shit.
You don't give a shit at all.

1506
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,080
I don't give a shit dude.
We've dealt with whatever they did.

1507
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:06,210
We've done a thousand times around the 
globe.

1508
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,010
If anything,
they're,

1509
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:12,011
they're guilty of stealing from us.
You tell him about tampering with the 

1510
01:04:12,011 --> 01:04:12,011
election.
Now,

1511
01:04:12,011 --> 01:04:16,340
what I'm really talking about is how 
much investment trump has in Russia and 

1512
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:21,291
what Russia has on trump.
I sound weird shit going on boys with 

1513
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:25,011
them.
It didn't work out well the last time 

1514
01:04:25,011 --> 01:04:25,011
when we weren't friends.
Right.

1515
01:04:25,011 --> 01:04:29,030
It'd be nice to get along with them.
They don't have to try out their 

1516
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:29,030
missiles.
They work.

1517
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:34,790
It's not like North Korea,
but they got like a fucking,

1518
01:04:34,801 --> 01:04:36,150
what do they call those things?
A startup,

1519
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:38,180
you know,
they've got like Hashtag Fund my nuclear

1520
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,720
missile over there.
Um,

1521
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:43,470
I don't,
I refuse to get scared by that guy.

1522
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:46,470
I'm not scared by him,
by Putin,

1523
01:04:46,471 --> 01:04:48,270
but he's a scary fucking guy.

1524
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:49,950
I mean,
he's a murderer and a thug.

1525
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,370
There's a lot of murders here,
lot of motors.

1526
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,380
You remember that.
You've done terrible things as well.

1527
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,000
I love when he said that.
He's right.

1528
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,120
He's right.
Well,

1529
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,090
who,
who's the murderer?

1530
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,990
You know,
it goes a lot of killers over here too.

1531
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,330
And then a o'reilly goes,
well,

1532
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,620
who,
who's the killer over here?

1533
01:05:04,621 --> 01:05:09,621
And he just goes that Achilles.
And then he just moves onto the next 

1534
01:05:09,621 --> 01:05:09,621
question.
Yeah.

1535
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:10,890
Nobody will be like,
no,

1536
01:05:10,891 --> 01:05:13,020
wait,
I asked a fucking question,

1537
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,390
answer it,
and he'll get up and walk away.

1538
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:18,130
So he does know,
says move.

1539
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,260
He asked him questions about Russia.
He just gets up.

1540
01:05:20,261 --> 01:05:23,170
Fuck you.
Leaves cause you're fake news.

1541
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:26,230
Fake News.
You are fake news.

1542
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:29,290
Fake news outlet.
He might of sketches.

1543
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:30,830
You could do with that guy.
What?

1544
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:35,140
What lasted for cheating on his fucking 
wife and just hop asking a question.

1545
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,420
I'll just kept in the middle of it.
It's fake news.

1546
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:43,470
Fake News.
Who's panties in these as a fake fake 

1547
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,510
Alec Baldwin's reviving his career with 
them.

1548
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:52,650
I mean Alex,
I've always thought that that guy has 

1549
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:53,650
been killing it.
He's always doing great,

1550
01:05:53,651 --> 01:05:55,540
but I mean it's.
He's on fire right now.

1551
01:05:55,570 --> 01:06:00,570
Doing is Donald Trump.
Impression I missed one of the best 

1552
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:00,570
things he's ever done.
That guy's fucking hilarious.

1553
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:05,101
Did you ever see him on Jimeny Glick?
No fucking kid that got killed it on 

1554
01:06:05,101 --> 01:06:06,040
everything.
He's one of the funniest dudes out there

1555
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:08,230
and he's one of the best character 
actors out there.

1556
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:13,380
It's just that he looks like an 
astronaut superhero that they tried to 

1557
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,471
make them like this matinee idol guy and
he was really like a character actor 

1558
01:06:16,471 --> 01:06:16,720
guy.
And when he does,

1559
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:19,510
uh,
my wife was always watching 30 rock,

1560
01:06:19,511 --> 01:06:21,280
he fucking killed it.
Do you ever see what he did?

1561
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:22,960
Is Tracy Morgan impression?
No.

1562
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,720
Yeah,
I've,

1563
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:26,980
I've guy.
I'm a huge fan.

1564
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,560
Well,
he kills it so hard on snl is trump.

1565
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:30,790
I mean,
there's no way he's not funny.

1566
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,910
I mean that,
that impression is fucking disaster.

1567
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:36,100
It's destructive.
It's so good.

1568
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,990
I love that one joke with it.
I'd like to apologize to the blah blah,

1569
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,170
blah.
I'd like to apologize.

1570
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:42,880
He kept saying Appalachian eyes and they
go,

1571
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:44,890
are you trying to say trump?
You're trying to say apologize.

1572
01:06:44,891 --> 01:06:45,430
He gets.
No,

1573
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,540
I would never do that.

1574
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:56,220
I gotta say I've been just busy so I 
haven't been watching on a Saturday 

1575
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:56,220
night live.
I'm going to start watching it again.

1576
01:06:56,270 --> 01:06:57,130
Yeah.
I don't watch it either.

1577
01:06:57,131 --> 01:07:00,790
I just watched the clips online.
Don't have time to invest.

1578
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,880
Saturday night live is like one of those
things where I feel like they're going 

1579
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,181
to hit 50 percent of the time and ms dot
50 percent of the time I can't do that 

1580
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,940
so I'll just,
I'll wait for the hits.

1581
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,990
They great.
Maybe they got very efficient way.

1582
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:17,140
I'm going to finish digesting your art 
so I do it bro.

1583
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:18,580
Efficient.
All right.

1584
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,250
Well we have efficiently.
We have 10 episodes this season.

1585
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:26,310
I got to keep steering it back is last 
year when I promoted it I just went on 

1586
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:27,400
things trying to be funny and then in 
the end they'd be like,

1587
01:07:27,401 --> 01:07:30,160
oh by the way that I got to make sure I 
promote it,

1588
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:35,310
plug it,
plug it is for family on Netflix and if 

1589
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:35,310
you don't have Netflix,
how dare you.

1590
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:37,390
How dare you try to live your life 
without Netflix.

1591
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:39,820
Does everything on it.
So kids,

1592
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:42,460
my new TV,
I got a new TV doesn't even.

1593
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:44,470
I mean you don't even need something to 
get on Netflix.

1594
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:48,070
Get on Netflix right through the TV,
the TV hooked up to Wifi,

1595
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:53,100
Bam.
You know what kills me is you won't be 

1596
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,661
satisfied with that.
And within 18 months do you think 

1597
01:07:54,661 --> 01:07:54,661
because your neighbor will have 
something else.

1598
01:07:54,661 --> 01:07:55,840
I don't know my number.
Oh,

1599
01:07:55,841 --> 01:07:56,650
you're going to know your neighbors.

1600
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:06,240
I had to meet my neighbor the other day 
because my daughter's drone flew into 

1601
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:06,240
her yard.
Yeah,

1602
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,030
we got a drone.
It sucks.

1603
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:08,860
How high up does it go?
It goes high.

1604
01:08:08,861 --> 01:08:13,150
It's just doesn't listen to you.
If you spend 150 bucks in a drone,

1605
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,070
it doesn't listen.
You guys spend like 500.

1606
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:15,740
Then they listened

1607
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:17,120
to $150.
One.

1608
01:08:17,121 --> 01:08:22,121
It's like a vague suggestion and once it
gets more than a few hundred feet away 

1609
01:08:22,121 --> 01:08:27,011
from you,
that fucking thing is not listening 

1610
01:08:27,011 --> 01:08:27,011
anymore.
It just sailed right into her tree.

1611
01:08:27,011 --> 01:08:30,080
So I had to go down and get it.
Amazing video and those things you.

1612
01:08:30,081 --> 01:08:32,030
Oh yeah,
you can if you get a good one.

1613
01:08:32,031 --> 01:08:36,680
Not wanting to be video.
It is fucking weird man.

1614
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:39,620
I mean there was a town in Colorado that
passed a law letting you hunt them.

1615
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,320
So if you see one of the sky,
shoot it down.

1616
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,570
I love it.
I love it.

1617
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:49,660
I liked that too.
I used to have a bit about that when 

1618
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:50,450
Amazon was going to start delivering 
packages.

1619
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,670
I go,
that's going to be like down south.

1620
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:54,410
It's gonna be like skeet shooting with 
prizes

1621
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:56,170
to shooting down.
What'd you?

1622
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:03,660
Yeah,
just absolutely fucking shoot those 

1623
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:07,260
things out of the air.
That's one of the,

1624
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:08,300
I one time,
uh,

1625
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,390
I was over a friend's house.
We were at a pool one.

1626
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:10,820
Just.
Yeah,

1627
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:15,420
he just came home was just hovering over
the pool looking at.

1628
01:09:15,421 --> 01:09:18,140
It's like a fucking party.
My wife Sarah Bikinians Shit.

1629
01:09:18,141 --> 01:09:21,180
So what are you doing?
And I was like,

1630
01:09:21,181 --> 01:09:24,210
you know,
I had my usual overreaction.

1631
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,490
Like it's just hard.
It's go to big.

1632
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:29,490
It's just the future.
I will get a fucking gun.

1633
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:34,950
I don't give a fuck.
I'll have a cardboard cutout of me so I 

1634
01:09:34,981 --> 01:09:37,740
can see in the video or some shit 
somehow was going to get it.

1635
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:37,740
Get

1636
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,660
Away with it.
Just in a good bird gun,

1637
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:41,130
you know?
Good.

1638
01:09:41,131 --> 01:09:44,670
A 20 gauge,
just shoot it out of the sky.

1639
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,440
Something that's scattered,
scatters good,

1640
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:53,380
you know,
it'd be great is if you knew whose it 

1641
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,730
was and you could have somebody filming 
their face when you shut this shit out 

1642
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:59,421
of the sky,
despite their invasion of your own 

1643
01:09:59,421 --> 01:10:00,600
proper property.
How wrong that they would feel.

1644
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:01,920
What's weird?
That's not.

1645
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:06,950
There's no law above your house.
Like if someone flew that into your 

1646
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:09,330
house would be a problem.
If someone drove it into your yard,

1647
01:10:09,331 --> 01:10:12,590
it'd be a problem.
But if they hover over your house space.

1648
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:13,080
Yeah,
yeah.

1649
01:10:13,081 --> 01:10:15,330
It's airspace.
That's fucking weird.

1650
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:20,420
Right?
How does that work with like say if you 

1651
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,491
wanted to fly over Kim Kardashians house
in a helicopter and take pictures of 

1652
01:10:22,491 --> 01:10:22,491
her.
Are you allowed to.

1653
01:10:22,491 --> 01:10:22,910
How's that work?
Uh,

1654
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:23,260
yeah.

1655
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:27,240
There's noise ordinances or like you can
only fly so fucking low.

1656
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:32,330
How low a helicopter usually it's like I
wouldn't go lower than 700 feet.

1657
01:10:33,151 --> 01:10:35,100
Especially in Santa Monica.
Those people,

1658
01:10:35,101 --> 01:10:37,910
they hate that airport there and they 
want all of those people out of there.

1659
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,170
The killing that airport,
you know,

1660
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,030
they,
they had been trying to do that for her.

1661
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,690
Now though,
they're going to turn into a park.

1662
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:43,830
All right.
Yeah.

1663
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,340
They,
uh,

1664
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:45,600
they just passed it.
It's gonna.

1665
01:10:45,601 --> 01:10:48,330
I think it goes out and I think it's 20 
slash 20.

1666
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,890
It goes under a three more years of a 
airport.

1667
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:58,200
Say though,
all those people that live in like 

1668
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:58,530
Marina del Rey and all those places 
around there with a lot of cash and they

1669
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:00,900
will park their jet there.
They're fucking pissed.

1670
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,990
The I want to fly right in there and 
just,

1671
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:05,100
Oh my God,
yes.

1672
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:06,870
Yeah,
that was perfect.

1673
01:11:06,871 --> 01:11:08,250
Well,
now they have to go to van nuys,

1674
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,130
Torrance,
man.

1675
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,930
Eyes.
You go to torrance,

1676
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,370
going to be in traffic for two hours.

1677
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:15,900
Uh,
yeah.

1678
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:20,930
No,
that's all kind of amazing that they 

1679
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:20,930
passed that,
you know,

1680
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:21,840
that those people couldn't figure out a 
way to bribe their way.

1681
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:25,440
I'm shipping that airport,
but three years is a long fucking time.

1682
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:27,690
Do you remember in New York City when 
they first had those videos,

1683
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:33,260
you know,
advertising in the back of cabs and 

1684
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,301
everybody was like,
these are making me car sick at these 

1685
01:11:35,301 --> 01:11:35,301
things to fuck out of here.
People had such a reaction to it,

1686
01:11:35,301 --> 01:11:38,220
they went away and then like a few years
later they just came back,

1687
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:43,450
just came back.
Now he loves them and they fucking 

1688
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:43,450
gross.
Just touching that screen.

1689
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:44,940
All of that.
It's bad enough being in the cabinets.

1690
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:50,030
You just see the fingerprints.
It's bad enough opening and closing the 

1691
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:50,030
door.
But I can't see the fingerprints.

1692
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:50,930
Those screens.
I,

1693
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:52,140
I don't,
I don't like.

1694
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:53,880
Well it's always loud too.

1695
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:57,270
They're always loud and they're playing 
you ads and some entertainment news,

1696
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,040
tv show or something like that.
Yup.

1697
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:02,110
I feel like a hypocrite because I do 
advertise on my podcast.

1698
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:04,740
So how mad can I get?
But I do draw the line when I go to pump

1699
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:06,990
gas,
like gas,

1700
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:07,910
TV,
blah,

1701
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,050
blah blah.
And they just pumping it super loud.

1702
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,810
You do ads on your progress,
but you should in the ads,

1703
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:18,350
like I heard you're doing an ad for me 
undies with the new one where they're 

1704
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:18,350
doing with the,
uh,

1705
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:19,840
the gay pride thing.
And you're like,

1706
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:22,820
it.
It's just like,

1707
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:24,240
it's very hard to get,
I think,

1708
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,170
straight guys to get into like or 
animals,

1709
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:27,960
you know what I mean?
We don't,

1710
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:31,440
we don't have the sense of style.
Maybe you get a couple of Metro sexuals,

1711
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:33,540
but yeah,
it just felt like that was a great.

1712
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:39,350
Like what can we,
what can we pretend to care about that 

1713
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:40,800
will get us to sell more underwear?
And that was,

1714
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:44,420
that was the way to fucking go.
I'm bored.

1715
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:48,260
I just say things I don't fuck.
It just felt like that was,

1716
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:53,130
you know what it really is.
I have two pairs and they're very.

1717
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:54,780
Greg Louganis,
I'll tell you,

1718
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:59,880
he got little ones,
the little ones and I put them on to 

1719
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,090
make my wife left and she did laugh,
but she goes,

1720
01:13:00,091 --> 01:13:00,900
no,
I kind of like,

1721
01:13:00,901 --> 01:13:01,140
um,
um,

1722
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:03,150
like thesis.
Just too little.

1723
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:05,400
I get the boxer briefs.
Oh,

1724
01:13:05,401 --> 01:13:06,960
they have boxer briefs.
That's all I wear.

1725
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,780
I'm wearing them right now.
I don't believe you.

1726
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,710
I'm joking.
I thought,

1727
01:13:11,711 --> 01:13:13,050
you know what?
For some reason I thought you would have

1728
01:13:13,051 --> 01:13:15,030
like the tear away fight once.
Oh,

1729
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:15,960
the Polka dot.
That's great.

1730
01:13:15,961 --> 01:13:18,180
That looks like a yogurt shit that they 
have.

1731
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:20,760
The Yoga,
whatever.

1732
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:24,870
The sprinkles.
Tcby sprinkles in your frozen fro.

1733
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:27,180
Yo.
I'm alright.

1734
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:29,950
Have I kept you here long enough?
I think I have this kind of.

1735
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:32,070
Is this going to be traffic you got to 
get out of here?

1736
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,360
I don't know.
I just,

1737
01:13:33,361 --> 01:13:38,361
I just wasn't sure who can't figure out 
if the point you're showing me your 

1738
01:13:38,361 --> 01:13:41,151
underwear it thinks and it fucking 
pattern that we've kind of covered it.

1739
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:43,320
So if there's anything else you want to 
bring up all the.

1740
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,410
What have you shot lately?
Uh,

1741
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,510
animal wise.
Shot a pig a couple months ago.

1742
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:49,890
Oh well shit.
Fuck the animals.

1743
01:13:49,891 --> 01:13:51,520
What else did you shoot?
No,

1744
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:52,900
just animals.
Okay.

1745
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:53,770
Yeah,
there was something else.

1746
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:54,360
No,
no,

1747
01:13:54,361 --> 01:13:54,510
no,
no,

1748
01:13:54,511 --> 01:13:56,410
no.
So you inching towards crusher.

1749
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,250
I'll give you some pigmeat.
Damn,

1750
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:00,390
I don't have it here.
Shit.

1751
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,100
Motherfucker.
I always get the elk.

1752
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:07,520
I'll give you an alkyne pig.
I still have the elk leftover from the 

1753
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:07,520
last name.
Okay.

1754
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,390
I have plenty of elk,
but uh,

1755
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:09,780
uh,
I want the wild boar.

1756
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:11,010
I'll give you a,
like a,

1757
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,180
like a fucking

1758
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:13,780
real,
a real leg leg.

1759
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,650
Like a boar leg.
Yeah.

1760
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:16,900
I live in a house,
man.

1761
01:14:16,901 --> 01:14:21,901
I don't have the fucking,
the fucking serial killer meat freezer 

1762
01:14:21,901 --> 01:14:22,550
that I know that you have.
We just got to tell me when you're going

1763
01:14:22,551 --> 01:14:24,190
to cook and I'll give it to you the day 
you cook it.

1764
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:26,620
All right.
No,

1765
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,100
that's not gonna happen.
That was one of those,

1766
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,710
you know,
I'll go on youtube and fill out.

1767
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:36,460
They'll go to fucking how to cook a uh,
a peg leg.

1768
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:38,200
Yeah.
We've just got to slow cook it.

1769
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,930
Just slow co Brian.
At first I'd like to.

1770
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:42,050
Brian thinks,
you know,

1771
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:44,780
you ever used those Yeti coolers?
You know what a Yeti cooler is?

1772
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:46,780
It's like a super,
really cold.

1773
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:51,900
It's a very insulated cooler.
Like you could put ice in it and leave 

1774
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,080
it outside in the sun and five days 
later I'll still have ice.

1775
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:54,910
Okay.
So you take one of those,

1776
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:57,970
put some ice in it and some sort of a 
bucket.

1777
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:01,570
Fill the bucket up with a saltwater June
and sugar.

1778
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,830
Yeah,
a bunch of Shit in there.

1779
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,880
Garlic,
stuff like that,

1780
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:07,570
and then Brian,
Brian to meet and make an extra 10.

1781
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:12,580
So she's a witch and then it just,
just like Brian and he's just such an 

1782
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,090
old school thing.

1783
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,140
Tie somebody to a stake.
And then at that point the uh,

1784
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:21,760
you don't have heard,
they never really.

1785
01:15:21,761 --> 01:15:23,620
They weren't really burning witches at 
the stake.

1786
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:25,060
That was bullshit.
They would drown them.

1787
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,230
I'm like,
well,

1788
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:29,050
that's just as terrifying why you got to
go drowning.

1789
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:34,410
Yeah.
GotTa go with drowning buys that o two 

1790
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:37,240
is for fucking minute or a blog said you
just pick a big inhale.

1791
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:42,360
I think what they would do is if,
if they would figure if you didn't 

1792
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,961
drown,
you were definitely a which and if you 

1793
01:15:45,961 --> 01:15:45,961
drowned,
they fucked up my bed.

1794
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:54,430
Which somebody stole something because 
there's a lot of weird shit going on,

1795
01:15:54,431 --> 01:15:55,600
you know?
How do you get out of that one?

1796
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:57,760
That's amazing though,
that that's what they used to think.

1797
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:02,830
They used to think that someone was 
doing witchcraft when things would go 

1798
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:05,341
wrong.
I don't think that's amazing because I 

1799
01:16:05,341 --> 01:16:07,531
think that's.
That kind of thought is just slid into 

1800
01:16:07,531 --> 01:16:08,950
other shit that people think,
you know.

1801
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:12,280
Do you know what the root of it was in 
the Salem witch trials?

1802
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:17,910
It was a.
They got a late frost and they're bread 

1803
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:20,760
like apparently when you get a late 
frost and wheat you can get some weird 

1804
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,290
mold that grows on the wheat and this 
wheat was growing.

1805
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:28,291
This type of mold called Ercot in Ercot 
has the same properties as LSD.

1806
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:32,020
So these people were eating the bread 
and tripping their fucking balls off and

1807
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:37,021
they thought that keep dm hat's really 
freaky with a belt buckle on your hat of

1808
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:39,820
the belt buckle and your shoes.

1809
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:41,890
And we used to have those stupid buckles
on their shoes.

1810
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,400
I'm sorry,
I did the go,

1811
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,250
go.
I did the comedy comic thing.

1812
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:47,360
Go ahead.
So anyways,

1813
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:52,370
so they're tripping on this shit.
And so they thought that these people 

1814
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:52,370
were bewitched,
they thought they were getting,

1815
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:57,151
which they were getting hex by witches,
and so they had these people that they 

1816
01:16:57,151 --> 01:16:58,120
didn't trust and they were freaking out 
because they were on acid.

1817
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:02,980
And that's one of the primary theories 
that crazy.

1818
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:05,320
You imagine being on acid in the 17 
hundreds,

1819
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,080
how much you'd be freaking out.
Yeah,

1820
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,370
I mean there's no information

1821
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,030
on it.
Once I actually,

1822
01:17:12,031 --> 01:17:12,920
I thought some of the,
uh,

1823
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:15,020
the original people,
whatever you supposed to call them now,

1824
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:17,120
indigenous people.
You're not supposed to say the natives.

1825
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:20,090
I fucking said that in Canada and 
somebody can I view the,

1826
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:20,360
the.
Oh,

1827
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:24,530
ogs and Canada have enabled them 
original or first nation.

1828
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:26,180
First nation.
Yeah.

1829
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,460
They have a different name for them.
We can have first responders.

1830
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:33,580
They got weird rules in Canada.
Do you know they can go out at night 

1831
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:34,160
with flashlights and shoot deer and 
Moose.

1832
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:37,760
They flash flashlights on them and all 
year round they don't have any,

1833
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,560
any rules.
They have that in America too.

1834
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:40,450
Like,
uh,

1835
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:45,490
they don't have like game laws for the 
native American reservation areas.

1836
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,410
Like they can just no flashlights.
Um,

1837
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:52,760
I'm actually doing a Gig for the cops 
tomorrow.

1838
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,880
What are you doing to some of the 
California Highway Patrol?

1839
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:57,580
Where it's a good move.
I don't know.

1840
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,030
Yeah,
you can never know enough cops.

1841
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,680
Never know.
Never know enough cops.

1842
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:05,681
You had no idea when you're going to 
snap and you're going to need a cop to 

1843
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:05,681
show up.
Oh Joe,

1844
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,640
get outta here.
Come on.

1845
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:08,960
You're not hurt that bad buddy.

1846
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,640
Walk it off.
Walk it off.

1847
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,520
You'll be fine.
Um,

1848
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,830
I think that all the motorcycle guys I 
want to talk to.

1849
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,210
I was hoping I was going to,
uh,

1850
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:24,910
meet some of the helicopter pilots 
because those fucking gay flat like 300 

1851
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:24,910
feet.
The balls.

1852
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:25,220
This guys here,
they're really.

1853
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,290
Yeah,
they were other people's houses and they

1854
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:32,291
got to sit there and a fucking circle.
Yay for like an hour or nauseous looking

1855
01:18:32,571 --> 01:18:37,571
at it first moved to La.
This girl I was dating a right outside 

1856
01:18:37,571 --> 01:18:41,111
of her house.
Someone broke into someone's house and 

1857
01:18:41,111 --> 01:18:41,210
they had the helicopter flying overhead.
It was fucking creepy.

1858
01:18:41,211 --> 01:18:46,211
Like you look outside the window,
you'd see the spotlight moving across 

1859
01:18:46,211 --> 01:18:49,091
the city street down to the Improv is 
the building still exists if you park 

1860
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:56,390
just east of uh,
of crescent heights is a building on the

1861
01:18:56,391 --> 01:19:01,391
second floor.
They have ceiling to floor windows and 

1862
01:19:01,391 --> 01:19:02,690
something with somebody broke in there 
and they had like the,

1863
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,420
the,
the,

1864
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,330
the helicopter spotlight was on it.

1865
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:10,510
And I watched two cops,
like a movie walking down that hallway 

1866
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:11,320
with their guns drawn.
Slowly walking in,

1867
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,200
just sitting there.
Like,

1868
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:14,920
what the fuck is this?
Yeah,

1869
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:20,490
it was like,
probably like four months into moving 

1870
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:22,541
here.
The craziest Shit I ever saw with cops 

1871
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:23,210
live was on TV during the North 
Hollywood shootout.

1872
01:19:23,211 --> 01:19:25,220
Where you in La back then?
I was in Vegas,

1873
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:26,690
but I was living in La.
Yeah.

1874
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:29,180
Those guys,
they had the head to toe body armor.

1875
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,600
They had head to toe body armor trunks 
filled with guns.

1876
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,360
They're all steroid it up out of their 
fucking mind.

1877
01:19:35,361 --> 01:19:40,361
Crazy probably on meth had just gone to 
some of that trip and.

1878
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:43,010
Yep.
That was,

1879
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:45,560
that was crazy.
That was crazy.

1880
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:46,130
We were,
uh,

1881
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:47,870
on news radio.
It was a,

1882
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:53,020
we're in the lunch room,
like our break room watching on tv 

1883
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:53,390
going,
what in the fuck,

1884
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,680
just live shooting from there too.

1885
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,790
I would have retired the next day as a 
cop.

1886
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,830
I would have been like,
is this what the future is?

1887
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:06,280
And I mean,
you're going to give me this little 

1888
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:06,280
fucking pea shooter.
Like this is what I'm supposed to do.

1889
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:06,910
I'm done.
A lot of them did.

1890
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:11,990
I'm sure I would've.
That would've been when they will 

1891
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:11,990
fucking crouched behind that car and 
that guy.

1892
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:16,020
Remember that guy spraying the.
I love how people going to go will open 

1893
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,510
shot.
The Guy who was clearly hurt there.

1894
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:20,160
I mean they wouldn't pull them away.
They let them bleed out.

1895
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:24,090
He got shot under the vest.
You got like took one under the vest and

1896
01:20:24,091 --> 01:20:26,760
the gut and they let him bleed out and 
people were complaining.

1897
01:20:26,761 --> 01:20:27,590
Good.
Yeah,

1898
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:28,470
exactly.
Good.

1899
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:30,240
That's what you get.
My mother would have said,

1900
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:31,680
well,
you shot at the place.

1901
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,900
That's what you get.
You know now yellow,

1902
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:37,980
maybe there's reincarnation.
You'll,

1903
01:20:37,981 --> 01:20:39,720
you'll learn next time you're supposed 
to be above.

1904
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:40,890
I got more kids.
Love that.

1905
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,320
If you're a peace officer for whatever 
reason.

1906
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:44,610
No,
that's stupid.

1907
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:49,790
I agree.
That's like an athlete's when someone 

1908
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:49,790
says fucking crazy shit to your face.
Use.

1909
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:49,870
We were supposed to be above that.
No,

1910
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:51,620
you can't.
You them.

1911
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:53,160
Right.
In the perfect world,

1912
01:20:53,161 --> 01:20:55,950
in a perfect world,
some woman on twitter,

1913
01:20:55,970 --> 01:21:00,970
Lady Lady,
some lady on twitter was harassing 

1914
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:01,950
Donald Trump and Donald Trump blocked 
her,

1915
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:07,790
which is hilarious.
So she showed that Donald trump blocked 

1916
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:10,701
her and then she said she's contacting a
lawyer and she said that the president 

1917
01:21:10,701 --> 01:21:13,620
shouldn't be able to block her and 
everybody's like,

1918
01:21:13,621 --> 01:21:17,730
what the fuck are you talking about?
And then people started harassing her so

1919
01:21:17,731 --> 01:21:19,770
she started blocking people and they're 
like,

1920
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:21,390
listen,
you fucking crazy bitch.

1921
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:24,030
This is what's called a hypocrite.
You can't do that.

1922
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:29,040
Shrink him in the White House.
You know when you scroll with both your 

1923
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,120
thumbs just sitting there and typing 
like this is what he's doing.

1924
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,130
Blocking people on twitter.
Yeah.

1925
01:21:32,131 --> 01:21:34,800
He blocks people to,
you know what else he does?

1926
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:39,980
He watches five hours of TV a day.
How the fuck does he have time?

1927
01:21:40,441 --> 01:21:42,420
I don't have time to watch five hours of
TV a day.

1928
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:47,340
People know how to delegate.
That's what he's doing.

1929
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,920
He's delegating his time to the vice 
president.

1930
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:53,910
I bet he looks at him like he's his ward
and just,

1931
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:58,940
you know,
military codes are over there and just 

1932
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:05,140
handed.
He's still in our team talking about me 

1933
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:05,140
this bad.
I got.

1934
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:05,490
I don't know.
I look,

1935
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:10,550
I couldn't handle that fucking job to 
Howard stern had the funniest fucking 

1936
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:12,270
take on him on Donald trump was saying 
like,

1937
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:16,050
why the fuck would you take that job at 
Urh?

1938
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:17,210
He goes,
you got,

1939
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:19,950
you got like eight good summers left.
He goes,

1940
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,270
you're going to spend that taken all 
this shit.

1941
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,740
He just kept going back to that.
You get eight summers lift.

1942
01:22:25,741 --> 01:22:28,610
He kept to get good take on it.
It was fucking hilarious and it was.

1943
01:22:28,630 --> 01:22:30,390
It was perfect.
Why would you do that?

1944
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:33,510
The like you're a fucking billionaire.
Just go enjoy your money.

1945
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:36,510
Ego could do it all.
Could do it all.

1946
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:42,080
I could be the fucking president because
they trashed him at the brunch 100 

1947
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:42,080
percent.
He was like,

1948
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,500
fuck you.
I'll show you.

1949
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,150
Because they,
they mocked him,

1950
01:22:45,151 --> 01:22:46,710
made fun of them because that was during
the birth,

1951
01:22:46,730 --> 01:22:51,730
put him right in the middle of the room.
Do you know every roast is always that 

1952
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:55,461
raw meat guy and you don't realize you 
have that guy until all of a sudden the 

1953
01:22:55,461 --> 01:22:55,461
roast starts as just like,
Oh fuck,

1954
01:22:55,461 --> 01:22:59,781
I'm the guy.
I'm the guy for when everybody runs out 

1955
01:22:59,781 --> 01:23:00,390
of jokes for the guy that they're 
hosting that,

1956
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:01,900
that they're roasting.
Yeah.

1957
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,420
Um,
yeah,

1958
01:23:03,421 --> 01:23:04,350
that's,
it's brutal.

1959
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:06,070
Yeah.

1960
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,240
And he,
he was,

1961
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:10,630
you know,
and they said one thing to them that was

1962
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:11,620
hilarious,
like,

1963
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:16,770
but um,
one thing that you'll never be the 

1964
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:18,871
president of the United States.
That was one of the things that Obama 

1965
01:23:18,871 --> 01:23:19,300
said.
Yeah.

1966
01:23:19,301 --> 01:23:20,960
And he shot them all and he

1967
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:23,420
the fucking hand over the keys to the 
house.

1968
01:23:23,421 --> 01:23:24,650
I mean,
that had to abandon.

1969
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,520
Oh my God,
we never saw it coming.

1970
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:29,840
There's no way.
No Way.

1971
01:23:29,841 --> 01:23:32,480
This guy's gonna run.
No of this guy's gonna win.

1972
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:33,830
No.
And in a weird way,

1973
01:23:33,831 --> 01:23:38,831
it was sort of like a reverse like bully
movie because it was the liberals don't 

1974
01:23:38,831 --> 01:23:39,890
want it to them and they were totally 
bullying the guy 100 percent,

1975
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:42,410
but he was bullying Obama with the whole
fucking thing,

1976
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:43,880
the birther thing.
Right.

1977
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,000
So I dunno,
they're still going after that birth is 

1978
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,231
shit.
I saw something yesterday on some 

1979
01:23:52,231 --> 01:23:54,041
website that was showing how they have 
all these different confirmed sources 

1980
01:23:54,621 --> 01:23:59,621
that are showing that the Obama birth 
certificate was fake and I hope it was 

1981
01:23:59,621 --> 01:24:03,881
fake.
So I hope you unto his presidency and 

1982
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:03,881
already happened.
What do you,

1983
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:03,881
what can you do?
But I hope it was fake.

1984
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:05,630
I hope he scammed the country.
Listen,

1985
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,300
the fucking the NBA had that mobbed up 
ref.

1986
01:24:08,301 --> 01:24:10,700
And he said that he fucked the warriors.
And I mean the,

1987
01:24:10,701 --> 01:24:13,040
uh,
the kings out of that series against the

1988
01:24:13,041 --> 01:24:18,041
Lakers.
No one's going to take the fucking 

1989
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:18,041
Lakers title away for that year.
Really?

1990
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:18,041
Is that real?
Yeah.

1991
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:22,870
What is it?
He was a referee who's fucking fixing 

1992
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:22,870
games?
No,

1993
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:24,670
really that's how much you don't watch 
sports.

1994
01:24:24,671 --> 01:24:27,050
So you know,
it would fit him.

1995
01:24:27,051 --> 01:24:30,650
Donna,
he 100 percent of NBA reps gamble,

1996
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:35,510
but he's also like,
he's in jail now.

1997
01:24:35,511 --> 01:24:40,511
He's just trying to say shit.
But like this is the guy that was the 

1998
01:24:40,511 --> 01:24:40,511
ref that was in jail.
Yeah.

1999
01:24:40,511 --> 01:24:41,870
But like he,
he sat him right there.

2000
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,190
Yeah.
He fixed gay.

2001
01:24:43,191 --> 01:24:44,840
He used to say from in jail.
He goes,

2002
01:24:44,841 --> 01:24:47,120
you tell me who's reffing the game?
And I'll tell you who wins.

2003
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:52,600
Wow.
He spent 15 months in prison after 

2004
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:52,790
pleading guilty to charges the case.
He's out freedom.

2005
01:24:52,791 --> 01:24:53,300
How much you do

2006
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:56,620
you think he made?
He joined callen.

2007
01:24:56,970 --> 01:25:00,960
Colin cowherd Wednesday afternoon.
Had a fascinating answer.

2008
01:25:00,961 --> 01:25:03,420
When asked what percentage?
He said 100.

2009
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:05,340
Wow.
That's.

2010
01:25:05,370 --> 01:25:06,410
No,
no,

2011
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:07,320
no,
not true.

2012
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:09,820
No,
that's just a fucking jail bird.

2013
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:14,860
Talk it.
I used to gamble on UFC fights way back 

2014
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:15,150
in the early days when I first started 
working for them.

2015
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:16,980
I was like,
who gives a shit?

2016
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:19,650
I can't really affect the outcome.
So like in many,

2017
01:25:19,651 --> 01:25:20,970
many years ago,
like I would,

2018
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:22,620
they would,
they bring in these guys,

2019
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:27,860
like they bring in some guy from Brazil 
that I knew about and I would look at 

2020
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:29,430
the line of like,
you guys are out of your fucking mind,

2021
01:25:29,431 --> 01:25:34,431
this guy,
she'd be like a 10 to one favorite and 

2022
01:25:34,431 --> 01:25:34,431
you've got an underdog.
I'm like,

2023
01:25:34,431 --> 01:25:34,500
Ooh,
I'm putting some money on that.

2024
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:36,660
And I put some money on it.
But then after awhile it's like,

2025
01:25:36,661 --> 01:25:38,790
this is probably not smart,
you know,

2026
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:41,640
I don't think it's illegal because I 
can't speak for the company.

2027
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:43,440
No,
it's also not good for me.

2028
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:46,470
See if I come off as biased anyway,
you know,

2029
01:25:46,530 --> 01:25:49,050
I've been accused of being a biased 
commentator anyway.

2030
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:51,480
Tap Out.
Come on,

2031
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:52,940
come by.

2032
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:55,720
Yeah.
But,

2033
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:57,400
um,
that's a,

2034
01:25:57,401 --> 01:26:02,401
that's a different kind of thing though.
Gambling when you're a referee is a big 

2035
01:26:02,401 --> 01:26:02,401
deal.
Yeah.

2036
01:26:02,401 --> 01:26:04,610
And that's a game that's easily fixed.
How do they fix it?

2037
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,320
What do they do?
Because you can,

2038
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:09,350
you can take stars out of the game by 
giving them false.

2039
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,640
Oh,
is that what they did?

2040
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:12,720
Yeah.
We just,

2041
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:16,430
you just sit people down.
It's just like if you're the best player

2042
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:18,980
on the team and the first quarter I give
you two quick fouls,

2043
01:26:18,981 --> 01:26:23,981
I'm not going to see you again until the
second quarter and I've never fixed a 

2044
01:26:23,981 --> 01:26:24,410
fucking game,
but I mean I'm just,

2045
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:25,530
you know,
I'm just,

2046
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:27,710
I give you another one in the second 
quarter.

2047
01:26:27,711 --> 01:26:32,711
I don't see it to the next half and at 
some point you're going to get mad if I 

2048
01:26:32,711 --> 01:26:34,250
keep calling bullshit files,
I might get you in a technical foul that

2049
01:26:34,251 --> 01:26:39,251
saves me a ticky tack file that counts 
towards your files and then two files to

2050
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:42,020
tacticals you're out of the game.
You're rejected.

2051
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:44,630
So was it obvious that this guy was 
doing files that it was.

2052
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:47,710
I thought it was obvious that the NBA 
was kind of fixed for a while.

2053
01:26:47,711 --> 01:26:49,300
Like I was sitting going late.
Yeah.

2054
01:26:49,301 --> 01:26:50,620
I just,
I went to a game one time,

2055
01:26:50,621 --> 01:26:55,621
the Celtics versus Utah Jazz and I'm 
watching the fucking game and like just 

2056
01:26:55,621 --> 01:26:59,911
like the game starts that letting them 
play and then they're calling it tight 

2057
01:26:59,911 --> 01:27:04,020
and then they're letting them play.
Then they're calling it tight and it's 

2058
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:04,180
like there was never an ebb and flow and
how they will call in a game.

2059
01:27:04,181 --> 01:27:05,410
It's like a,
an empire,

2060
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:10,830
you know,
you've seen the first day and it got 

2061
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:10,830
step out of the box going,
okay,

2062
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:10,830
that's a strike tonight.
Okay,

2063
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:14,401
cool.
Just finding out where you strike zone 

2064
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:14,401
is,
but like an empire,

2065
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:16,900
if you start changing the strike zone,
kind of change in sports on your hair,

2066
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:19,150
like people are going to know like what 
the fuck's going on?

2067
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:22,080
You got to be consistent.
So like with um,

2068
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:24,040
NBA reps,
we,

2069
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:25,840
NBA Games you would watch and it's just 
like,

2070
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:27,070
oh,
they're calling a close tonight.

2071
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,170
Oh,
he's letting the boys play.

2072
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:34,440
And like that was the game.
They wouldn't just keep obviously if it 

2073
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:35,410
got really out of hand they would 
tighten down.

2074
01:27:35,411 --> 01:27:38,170
But I never saw a game where it's just 
like you're pulling back on the range,

2075
01:27:38,171 --> 01:27:39,470
you'll let them run,
you pulling back,

2076
01:27:39,471 --> 01:27:44,471
you letting them run.
And it just made me feel like they were 

2077
01:27:44,471 --> 01:27:44,471
shaving points is something I remember 
for years.

2078
01:27:44,471 --> 01:27:48,601
I said the game was fixed and um,
everybody said I was out of my fucking 

2079
01:27:48,601 --> 01:27:50,860
mind and then they find a guy who's all 
mobbed up,

2080
01:27:50,861 --> 01:27:52,540
but I go there vindication.
They go,

2081
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:53,510
oh,
it's just one guy.

2082
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,220
Now when you say mobbed up,
like how was he mobbed up?

2083
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,600
What was,
what was the issue with Dr?

2084
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:02,710
I was just an expression,
I don't want to get in trouble with 

2085
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:04,521
anybody,
but he was basically working for other 

2086
01:28:04,521 --> 01:28:05,760
people that were part of a gambling that
took a bookies or whatever.

2087
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:09,550
And he did something to make sure that 
the,

2088
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:13,350
the game leaned in that direction,
like you couldn't totally fix it.

2089
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:17,250
So if a team was favored by eight and 
they want them to win by eight,

2090
01:28:17,251 --> 01:28:22,251
he'd make sure it happened to probably.
It's probably easier to make sure they 

2091
01:28:22,251 --> 01:28:23,490
didn't buy fucking over their offense 
and then they were just,

2092
01:28:23,491 --> 01:28:26,280
you know,
they try to get money,

2093
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:26,730
like,
look,

2094
01:28:26,731 --> 01:28:27,900
if you're legit,
bookie,

2095
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:31,320
all you're trying to do is get an even 
amount of money on each side.

2096
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,360
Right,
okay.

2097
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:36,300
Because with the combination of people 
teasing it and plus the juice and all of

2098
01:28:36,301 --> 01:28:38,130
that,
you're going to end up on top.

2099
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,430
You don't want a bunch of money all on 
one side and losing your fucking shirt.

2100
01:28:41,431 --> 01:28:45,040
So what these guys would do is you get 
greedy after awhile.

2101
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:46,680
It's like,
I'm sick of this ticky tack Shit.

2102
01:28:46,681 --> 01:28:49,830
Let's go for a big fucking score.
And they wouldn't do it every game.

2103
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:51,840
They just every once in a while and be 
like,

2104
01:28:51,841 --> 01:28:54,330
alright listen,
here's a gay probably,

2105
01:28:54,331 --> 01:28:55,830
you know,
I don't,

2106
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,420
I don't have that fixed the fucking 
game.

2107
01:28:57,421 --> 01:29:00,060
I'm just guessing how they would go 
about doing it to fix this one.

2108
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,260
All right,
sure.

2109
01:29:01,261 --> 01:29:04,680
These guys don't win by eight.
So this guy admitted that he fixed it.

2110
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:05,740
Oh yeah.

2111
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:08,740
The J was somebody went to jail for 
gambling on it.

2112
01:29:08,741 --> 01:29:11,530
Right.
For fixing or fixing it.

2113
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:16,680
So what did he say?
He said like he made fouls that weren't 

2114
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:16,680
really fouls.
Well,

2115
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:16,680
yeah.
Yeah.

2116
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:21,520
You do whatever he had to do.
This attorney submitted saying the 

2117
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,960
manipulation that happened during one 
game.

2118
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:28,660
Okay.
So officiating playoff series feeding 

2119
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:30,930
team five and team six in May of 2002 as
a six game of a seven game series and a 

2120
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:32,680
team five victory that night would have 
ended the series.

2121
01:29:32,681 --> 01:29:37,681
However tim learned from referee a that 
referees a and f wanted to extend the 

2122
01:29:37,681 --> 01:29:40,810
series of seven games.
Tim knew referees a and F to B company,

2123
01:29:40,811 --> 01:29:42,490
men in quotes,
uh,

2124
01:29:42,491 --> 01:29:44,500
always acting in the interest of the 
NBA.

2125
01:29:45,070 --> 01:29:47,710
And that night it was the NBA is 
interest add another game.

2126
01:29:47,711 --> 01:29:50,920
So the NBA wanted to fix it,
follow the NBA,

2127
01:29:50,921 --> 01:29:54,030
fixing referees a and f heavily favored 
teams.

2128
01:29:54,031 --> 01:29:59,031
Six personal fouls resulting in 
obviously injured players were ignored 

2129
01:29:59,031 --> 01:30:00,340
even when they occurred in full view of 
the referees.

2130
01:30:00,341 --> 01:30:03,040
Conversely,
the referees called meetup fouls on team

2131
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:03,410
flower.
Yeah,

2132
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:07,660
the highlights of the Lakers kings game.
It was ridiculous.

2133
01:30:07,661 --> 01:30:10,300
The files that they will come.
But that's my thing is when they said it

2134
01:30:10,301 --> 01:30:11,530
was just one guy,
it's like,

2135
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,750
how long could you be on an officiating 
crew while the in,

2136
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:18,460
in one of your guys is dirty before 
you'd realize like,

2137
01:30:18,461 --> 01:30:19,780
what the fuck is this guy doing?

2138
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:25,260
Well,
what about the guys that we're betting 

2139
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:25,260
on the other team?
I'd want to kill that fucking referee.

2140
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:29,330
Can you imagine if you saw him call 
fouls and weren't really fouls in you 

2141
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:33,090
knew,
you knew your money was going out the 

2142
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:34,951
window.
But I think they're really susceptible 

2143
01:30:34,951 --> 01:30:34,951
to it because like the amount of money 
that NBA players

2144
01:30:34,951 --> 01:30:37,280
because fucking insane.
They make like,

2145
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:42,580
you know,
some of the contracts that they have 

2146
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:44,261
coming up and this.
So there's so few guys on the team and 

2147
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:48,610
there's like every year the draft is 
like two rounds in the draft.

2148
01:30:48,611 --> 01:30:53,611
Like fucking nfl goes on forever is 40 
something guys on a team in the NFL.

2149
01:30:53,691 --> 01:30:56,720
There's 20 something in baseball,
20 something in,

2150
01:30:56,721 --> 01:30:58,730
uh,
in the NHL.

2151
01:30:58,731 --> 01:31:00,290
And I think,
I think basketball,

2152
01:31:00,291 --> 01:31:05,291
it's no more than 11 or 12 guys.
So it's a very small group of people in 

2153
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:10,520
the income that they're generating their
revenue share.

2154
01:31:10,521 --> 01:31:12,920
I don't know how I like,
to all that's all like super sports nerd

2155
01:31:12,921 --> 01:31:14,360
shit.
Like I don't know how that works,

2156
01:31:14,361 --> 01:31:19,361
but some of the contracts that they,
that some of these guys have been 

2157
01:31:19,361 --> 01:31:19,361
signing,
like they can afford to fucking pay that

2158
01:31:19,361 --> 01:31:24,011
guy that.
So now you're a ref and you're running 

2159
01:31:24,011 --> 01:31:26,120
with your fucking black aerobic reebok 
sneakers up and down the court,

2160
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:29,260
you know the velcade yet.

2161
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:34,270
Yes.
And just seeing the cars these guys are 

2162
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:35,120
getting in and all the women hanging out
and you're on the stage two,

2163
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:38,300
you're running up and down.
No one gives a fuck about you.

2164
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:41,210
And uh,
I don't know what the pension is for the

2165
01:31:41,211 --> 01:31:43,910
NBA,
but like if I was in the NBA I would,

2166
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:48,940
if I was running I'd be like,
we gotta fucking triple these guys' 

2167
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:51,521
salary.
Is this the salaries of the players of 

2168
01:31:51,521 --> 01:31:51,521
the referees NBA player salaries for.
What?

2169
01:31:51,521 --> 01:31:52,760
About the referees though?
Oh,

2170
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:56,150
so look at that.
Thirty $5 million a year for Lebron.

2171
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:58,970
That's just,
that's just what he makes the play hoop.

2172
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:00,200
Not about

2173
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:03,490
sneaker contracts are like more than 
what they make.

2174
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:05,590
It's fucking nuts.
It's nuts.

2175
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,760
It's a lot of canned goods for them.
I'm not,

2176
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:09,700
I'm not saying they should make the 
money.

2177
01:32:09,701 --> 01:32:11,470
Obviously if people putting it out there
earning,

2178
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:14,890
but like find.
Can you put up what a ref makes?

2179
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:17,590
Do you know who Mike Conley is?
That's what's hilarious.

2180
01:32:17,591 --> 01:32:21,280
I only know like the biggest guys are.
That might cause them who.

2181
01:32:21,281 --> 01:32:23,530
That's my commonly fucks.
I don't know who that is.

2182
01:32:23,531 --> 01:32:24,820
Either.
Dry made $30,000,000

2183
01:32:24,821 --> 01:32:25,300
last year

2184
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,870
is the highest paid player in the NBA.
He says because the contract.

2185
01:32:28,871 --> 01:32:30,580
This is a guy named Mike Conley.
Yeah,

2186
01:32:30,581 --> 01:32:35,581
he was.
He's the starting point guard for the 

2187
01:32:35,581 --> 01:32:35,581
Memphis Grizzlies.
Yeah.

2188
01:32:35,581 --> 01:32:36,190
Oh there you go.
Let's find a matter of time,

2189
01:32:36,191 --> 01:32:39,470
like his contract came up at the time 
last year and the uh,

2190
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:44,670
when the rest of the guys are going to 
get more of this coming year and the 

2191
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:45,550
following year the TV contracts have 
gone up and there's a percentage.

2192
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:50,551
They're going up each year based off of 
the TV rights and that's why I watched 

2193
01:32:50,551 --> 01:32:53,290
almost every Celtic game last year.
I never heard my con Mike Conley.

2194
01:32:53,291 --> 01:32:57,360
That sounds like a fucking tissue.
Which Ohio state sent me.

2195
01:32:57,370 --> 01:33:00,170
Was Greg Gordon who was the big bust and
he was just the point guard.

2196
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:01,660
Is He still playing in China?
No,

2197
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:04,030
no,
he's actually Ohio state assistant coach

2198
01:33:04,031 --> 01:33:05,350
right now.
He went back to school for

2199
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:07,340
Planar China.
That's when it gets weird.

2200
01:33:07,341 --> 01:33:12,341
Right,
and you got to go overseas to Europe 

2201
01:33:12,341 --> 01:33:12,341
playing for 100 grand a year and you're 
like,

2202
01:33:12,341 --> 01:33:12,341
Ooh.
I don't know.

2203
01:33:12,341 --> 01:33:13,820
Sometimes if you're famous enough 
they'll.

2204
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,860
They'll give you a little more.
I don't know how that works either.

2205
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:21,550
I don't know how that shit works.
I just know I have a show coming out 

2206
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:21,550
called F is for family.
That's why I'm here.

2207
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:25,130
The average salary that'd be a rep is 
from a hundred 50 grand to 550 grand.

2208
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:30,250
That's a big spread.
What about the guy who's making the 

2209
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:30,250
extra four?
How's he getting extra?

2210
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:34,061
For average,
salaries of spiked considerably since 

2211
01:33:34,061 --> 01:33:36,890
1983 when NBA officials made between 
18,070

2212
01:33:36,891 --> 01:33:38,120
8,000
each season.

2213
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:41,690
Five hundred 50 grand is not bad.
That's a lot of scratch.

2214
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:45,590
She'd have to give them enough money 
where they don't feel tempted to cheat.

2215
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:46,880
Right?

2216
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:49,460
Yeah.
That's the problem with politicians.

2217
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:55,300
You make 550 grand a year.
You're making 50 grand a year more than 

2218
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:55,400
the president,
so you kind of like.

2219
01:33:55,401 --> 01:34:00,401
Those guys are like set up to be like,
here's a job that cost $100 million to 

2220
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:04,541
get and you're going to get paid 500 
grand so that you just setting them up 

2221
01:34:04,541 --> 01:34:08,711
to have to cut deals with people.
What do you think is gonna happen with 

2222
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:08,711
trump?
I have no idea.

2223
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:10,520
I don't even know the highest paid guy 
in the NBA.

2224
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:12,110
I have a few.
If you had a guest though,

2225
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:14,180
do you think this is gonna?
This is gonna last.

2226
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,860
Yes.
You don't think he's going to go to jail

2227
01:34:15,861 --> 01:34:17,620
and I'm in the middle of.
No,

2228
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:19,700
no.
I watched Clinton getting phd stayed.

2229
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:25,450
Right.
But Clinton got impeached for just not 

2230
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:25,580
telling the truth about an affair.
Nixon should have stayed.

2231
01:34:26,190 --> 01:34:31,190
Think so.
He should've just stayed and just being 

2232
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:31,190
like,
you know,

2233
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:31,190
alright,
I booked that room.

2234
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:34,550
I apologize for the American people.
And that's it.

2235
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:36,350
I think the stress is too much for them 
though.

2236
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,450
When the whole world comes after.
I'm like that.

2237
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:42,200
Everywhere you look,
every newspaper,

2238
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,190
I think,
uh,

2239
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:48,220
I think we'll be fine.
He's fucking watching five hours of TV 

2240
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:49,480
and he's on twitter blocking people.
I mean,

2241
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:52,310
what else?
Fluffing other sandwich.

2242
01:34:52,311 --> 01:34:53,690
I mean,
he's living like a fucking kid.

2243
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:54,860
Well,
it's hard to see.

2244
01:34:55,100 --> 01:35:00,100
When you read articles about them,
it's hard to know who's writing the 

2245
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:00,100
article and why they're writing it.
Right?

2246
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:05,050
Like are they writing this article 
because they really believe that he's 

2247
01:35:05,050 --> 01:35:07,541
gaining weight and he's solemn.
Then he's down in the dumps or are they 

2248
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:07,910
trying to just put that out there?
Like how the fuck did they know?

2249
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:10,040
He's down in the dumps that's trying to 
sell papers.

2250
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:14,000
How they know he's Sullen and comes home
upset and he's gaining weight.

2251
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:15,350
He does seem like you're gaining weight 
though.

2252
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:17,960
Simply like getting little fat,
little depression.

2253
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,220
Well,
I made this.

2254
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:24,280
Obviously most of the people,
it seems in the media fucking hate the 

2255
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:24,590
guy.
So they're going to be just just.

2256
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:27,190
Yeah,
but that's how you chip away at your.

2257
01:35:27,191 --> 01:35:32,191
Right.
So talking about how you're coming home 

2258
01:35:32,191 --> 01:35:32,191
when you're depressed or you're 
despondent,

2259
01:35:32,191 --> 01:35:35,150
you're not listening to anybody you had.
How do they know that?

2260
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:37,080
How do they know that?
Our sort of say,

2261
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:42,160
how do they know that our sources say 
negative things about the guys we don't 

2262
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:45,431
like?
Well you were talking about tiger woods 

2263
01:35:45,431 --> 01:35:46,931
on your podcast.
I was listening to it on the way over 

2264
01:35:46,931 --> 01:35:48,641
here and I totally agree with you were 
just saying like when tigers world fell 

2265
01:35:48,641 --> 01:35:48,641
apart,
like how the fuck do you know?

2266
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:53,860
Like what do you,
what did you talk to him like you don't 

2267
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:53,860
know him.
Yeah,

2268
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:54,290
give it to have a conversation.
And it was a brutal couple of years,

2269
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:59,291
but it was 10 years ago and in 10 years 
he hasn't fucked up other than this Dui.

2270
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:02,900
So I mean,
yeah,

2271
01:36:02,901 --> 01:36:04,040
he fucked up.
But Hey,

2272
01:36:04,041 --> 01:36:06,180
you know,
89,

2273
01:36:06,230 --> 01:36:08,060
so I'm going to judge him.
Right?

2274
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:11,000
The Dui,
apparently he's on some back medication.

2275
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,770
That's what it is.
He mixed his medication.

2276
01:36:12,771 --> 01:36:15,410
That's what he's saying.
But they said he smelled like booze.

2277
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,970
But I don't know if that's true.
She just take the hit and just be like,

2278
01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:18,500
ah,
you know,

2279
01:36:18,501 --> 01:36:20,320
I fucked up.
I was hanging out with the fellas,

2280
01:36:20,350 --> 01:36:21,400
blah blah blah.
I'm not kidding.

2281
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:26,420
I'm not condoning what the guy did,
but I'm not gonna sit there and judge 

2282
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:29,111
the guy and be like,
I was watching some guy and he was 

2283
01:36:29,111 --> 01:36:29,111
trying to say that,
you know,

2284
01:36:29,111 --> 01:36:29,210
you know he let us down.

2285
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:32,210
He,
he sold himself as a family man.

2286
01:36:32,211 --> 01:36:34,730
It's like you built that whole fucking 
narrative.

2287
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:38,420
Know you built that whole.
Now I just watched him play golf.

2288
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:43,160
All I ever want to do when I watch golf 
is watched those guys fucking crush it.

2289
01:36:43,850 --> 01:36:46,160
Like I love John Daly and I love that.
He's like,

2290
01:36:46,161 --> 01:36:47,050
fuck you.
I like drank.

2291
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:49,100
And he just kept drinking and smoking 
cigarettes.

2292
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:50,480
Cigarettes big.
Yeah.

2293
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:55,750
When he hit it a fucking mile.
And I loved watching it.

2294
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:58,970
Well,
tiger always had a very bizarre style.

2295
01:36:58,971 --> 01:37:03,971
Apparently I don't play golf,
but apparently people that I've talked 

2296
01:37:03,971 --> 01:37:05,740
to that explained to me the way he would
hit the ball like this,

2297
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:09,320
not the way they teach you to do it,
but he could do it so well that way,

2298
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:12,050
but he would put like ridiculous amounts
of Torque.

2299
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:13,400
Yes.
On his,

2300
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:14,280
on his boat.
And they,

2301
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:17,570
they said from the beginning that his 
body was going to break down if he keeps

2302
01:37:17,571 --> 01:37:17,960
doing that.

2303
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:20,600
There was a period where he adjusted his
swing and he stopped.

2304
01:37:21,530 --> 01:37:23,420
He stopped winning and then he came back
again.

2305
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:28,990
And um,
I just think that what they said there 

2306
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:29,720
was a bunch of guys,
Earl Campbell,

2307
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:32,180
they said if he keeps running like that,
he's wide open.

2308
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:37,390
He's going to have problems.
Bobby or the way he played hockey with 

2309
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:40,671
you throw yourself around.
He really beat the shit out of your 

2310
01:37:40,671 --> 01:37:40,671
body.
Like that happens.

2311
01:37:40,671 --> 01:37:44,060
And it just coincided with his personal 
life falling apart.

2312
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:45,560
So everybody goes,
oh,

2313
01:37:45,561 --> 01:37:49,370
that's the reason why you know somebody 
wins.

2314
01:37:49,371 --> 01:37:50,660
That's the reason why somebody loses 
like,

2315
01:37:50,661 --> 01:37:55,661
look,
I'm not saying you don't go to a couple 

2316
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:55,661
of your funk if you.
Yeah,

2317
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:55,661
your life falls apart in the personal 
area,

2318
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:56,130
but it's just like

2319
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:59,040
the rest of that shit,
you know,

2320
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:00,960
that was.
I mean that's just a bunch of hype.

2321
01:38:00,961 --> 01:38:02,130
Like for him it's like,
okay,

2322
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,540
doubled dump though,
you know.

2323
01:38:03,541 --> 01:38:08,541
I mean the thing happens personally with
his personal life and it happens 

2324
01:38:08,541 --> 01:38:11,841
publicly where everybody gets to see it 
and then on top of that his body's 

2325
01:38:11,841 --> 01:38:11,841
falling apart at the same time

2326
01:38:11,841 --> 01:38:12,440
no matter what he did.
Yeah.

2327
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:15,180
No matter where you went to church every
fucking week he was going to fuck up his

2328
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:16,710
back and his knees and they.
And it did.

2329
01:38:16,711 --> 01:38:18,810
But then they're trying to equate it to 
a,

2330
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:20,890
you know,
whatever.

2331
01:38:20,891 --> 01:38:25,891
The.
I think what he did was none of my 

2332
01:38:25,891 --> 01:38:25,891
business.
It's none of my fucking business.

2333
01:38:25,891 --> 01:38:26,280
I don't want to know about it.
I hate no one about,

2334
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:28,500
you know,
I feel bad if somebody like,

2335
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:30,690
if the marriage falls apart,
I feel bad.

2336
01:38:30,691 --> 01:38:32,100
If they get busted for and drop,
you know,

2337
01:38:32,101 --> 01:38:34,620
I mean it happens.
If you fucked up and it's your fault,

2338
01:38:34,621 --> 01:38:36,990
you should get punched,
but like the cops are handling it.

2339
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:39,540
They arrested him,
the courts will handle it.

2340
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:45,500
Do I need to talk to?
I need a pile on and start wagging my 

2341
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,460
fucking hypocrite.
Middle Finger out of my pasty freckled.

2342
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:51,600
You don't have to because you're a 
comedian and you're funny and your take 

2343
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,601
on things can be.
Have some compassion and look at it for 

2344
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:54,601
what it is.
Make Fun,

2345
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:59,040
poke at it,
but when you're one of those fucking 

2346
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,411
straight up sports commentator guys,
you don't have a whole lot of wiggle 

2347
01:39:01,411 --> 01:39:05,341
room as far as what you could say and 
what you don't say and you got to go 

2348
01:39:05,341 --> 01:39:06,300
right down the middle and attack.
You've got to go to Disney couples.

2349
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:07,070
Yeah,
go Disney.

2350
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:07,660
Yeah,
I mean,

2351
01:39:07,661 --> 01:39:11,440
what does this say about the fabric of 
our community?

2352
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:16,500
You know,
the morals of our conduct creates a 

2353
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:16,500
culture.
Look at this.

2354
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:19,830
Tiger woods is lost and every literal 
and figurative way by Iun O'connor,

2355
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:23,410
espn sports,
tiger woods.

2356
01:39:23,411 --> 01:39:28,411
You met in Jupiter,
Florida police report is not the tiger 

2357
01:39:28,411 --> 01:39:31,921
woods presented to you by tiger,
his sponsors and his reps that woods.

2358
01:39:32,590 --> 01:39:35,030
So here's the thing,
what this is fucking espn,

2359
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:40,060
those guys on tv,
what they present is not who the fuck 

2360
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:40,970
they are looking at this

2361
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:46,770
Nicholas,
they're saying that woods is a new and 

2362
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:47,640
improved human beings since his extra 
marital sex scandal from hell,

2363
01:39:47,790 --> 01:39:50,130
a better father and friend with or 
without a golf and his like.

2364
01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:50,700
How do you.

2365
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:56,180
Would she have sympathy for the guy who 
wrote this because he got it Kinda has 

2366
01:39:56,180 --> 01:40:01,180
to sit down and they got Jesus Christ.
How am I going to keep being a senior 

2367
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:02,030
writer unless I act like this shit 
actually bothers me.

2368
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:04,100
You have to write something 
inflammatory.

2369
01:40:04,101 --> 01:40:07,820
You have to write something salacious.
He gotta you gotta get people to Click.

2370
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:12,940
You got to get a lot of clickbait.
Why can't this fat fuck shutoff is 

2371
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:16,100
fireworks in his country to his son.
We do it all the time.

2372
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:21,250
We fucking lights shut off in the ocean.
Kill all this fish that people could 

2373
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:21,250
have eight till Wales.
Yeah.

2374
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:22,790
Kill fucking whales with tests.
Yeah.

2375
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:26,010
And then this fucking guy shoots off a 
rocket and everybody's,

2376
01:40:26,030 --> 01:40:26,750
oh,
hey,

2377
01:40:26,751 --> 01:40:28,790
what are you doing?
Boys threatening us.

2378
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,370
Bill threatened in America attitude.
I,

2379
01:40:31,371 --> 01:40:31,930
I,
you know,

2380
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:34,400
I worried that we're coming.
I love this shit talker.

2381
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:38,270
Probably hear,
oh well we are for sure with trump.

2382
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:40,190
I pitched this on somebody else's 
podcast.

2383
01:40:40,191 --> 01:40:45,191
What they should do,
they should eliminate war and then what 

2384
01:40:45,191 --> 01:40:45,470
it is is your leaders go into the 
octagon.

2385
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,180
They're not allowed to work out or 
anything.

2386
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:49,530
Not Allowed to work out.
No.

2387
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:52,550
They go in the fucking off.
So you get to see like,

2388
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,040
like right now,

2389
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:56,680
who's your number one world leader?
I got to go boat.

2390
01:40:56,681 --> 01:40:58,020
And yet 100 percent.
CSI,

2391
01:40:58,030 --> 01:40:58,900
judo,
black belt.

2392
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:00,940
Izzy.
He looks like he fucking head.

2393
01:41:00,941 --> 01:41:02,560
But you know,
he's a judo black belt.

2394
01:41:02,561 --> 01:41:07,561
He'll fuck up every other world where 
100 percent just pictured him choking 

2395
01:41:07,561 --> 01:41:09,430
out.
Trump says he would kill trump.

2396
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:11,830
He would trip them.
Can you imagine the ground?

2397
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:16,920
Can you imagine the sound of his foot 
hitting the side of this guy's sons 

2398
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,010
belly?
Just a nice fucking liver shot.

2399
01:41:18,011 --> 01:41:23,011
Will be the funniest shit ever.
And everybody sits there and like 

2400
01:41:23,011 --> 01:41:24,790
whatever you,
whatever the dispute is.

2401
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:27,090
This is our territory.
That's Terry.

2402
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:31,390
It's just solved with world leader,
mixed martial arts.

2403
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:34,480
You go and you can do whatever you want.
It'd be like the early days of that shit

2404
01:41:34,481 --> 01:41:36,340
when the guy came in with the one boxing
glove,

2405
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:41,700
like trump,
trump could still wear a tie with like 

2406
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:48,020
the little tight shorts on and he could 
keep wingtip shoes on if you want to 

2407
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:48,020
keep.

2408
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:50,230
You can do whatever the fuck you want to
do within reason.

2409
01:41:50,231 --> 01:41:51,760
I don't want,
I don't want to be too violent,

2410
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,240
but they just have to fucking,
oh to be hilarious.

2411
01:41:55,241 --> 01:42:00,241
Because what?
First of all that fucking doesn't the 

2412
01:42:00,241 --> 01:42:00,241
uh,
the sun have to wear glasses too.

2413
01:42:00,241 --> 01:42:00,430
And uh,
in uh,

2414
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:05,750
the Kim Jong Il part to the cul the sun 
caddyshack.

2415
01:42:06,850 --> 01:42:07,840
Does he wear glasses?
Yeah.

2416
01:42:07,841 --> 01:42:09,720
So He'd have to come in with the Kareem 
goggles,

2417
01:42:09,721 --> 01:42:10,900
you know,
prescription level,

2418
01:42:11,230 --> 01:42:13,750
like a basketball player if they make 
those in North Korea,

2419
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:15,470
you know what I mean?
Don't get into the China.

2420
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:20,840
China's onto them,
their friends to solve it that way 

2421
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:21,580
through the job.
Be a laptop custom painted.

2422
01:42:21,581 --> 01:42:22,900
That looks like a better color than 
mine.

2423
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,310
No,
the new ones come in.

2424
01:42:24,311 --> 01:42:26,950
Two colors that come into the dark gray 
or a light gray,

2425
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:28,090
a dark gray one.

2426
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:31,300
I have to throw my out and I'm going to 
personally put mine in the ocean.

2427
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:34,270
Do you have the brand new one that gets 
throwing mine in the ocean?

2428
01:42:34,271 --> 01:42:39,271
Don't do that.
To kill some sea life for kids and what 

2429
01:42:39,271 --> 01:42:42,331
do they do?
See all the porn I used to watch and 

2430
01:42:42,331 --> 01:42:42,331
then they fucking gets you stuck 
shooting.

2431
01:42:42,331 --> 01:42:45,810
They start shooting missiles off.
I'm all right,

2432
01:42:45,851 --> 01:42:50,851
dude.
Get out of here before the traffic gets 

2433
01:42:50,851 --> 01:42:50,851
so much.
My pleasure,

2434
01:42:50,851 --> 01:42:51,370
brother.
Thank you for the offer of the pig leg.

2435
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:55,570
I'll take that off your next time.
Alright is for family today.

2436
01:42:55,571 --> 01:42:58,690
It's one of the funniest fucking shows 
you will ever watch in your life.

2437
01:42:58,691 --> 01:43:02,500
It's on Netflix right now.
Goal Binge Binge.

2438
01:43:02,501 --> 01:43:03,670
You freaks.
Thank you.

2439
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:04,240
Thank you.
