00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,170
Hello Freak bitches.
It's um,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,330
it all is about the,
the,

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:07,740
uh,
the issues with interspecies

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:08,800
communication.
Let's pray.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,190
Dolphins,
they kind of understand the concept,

6
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:13,290
but they can't make the noise cause they
have a blowhole.

7
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,870
But this lady was trying,
she was living with this thing for a

8
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:18,400
long time and she was jerking the
dolphin off and then they would,

9
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,670
they,
I still train that and lily was doing

10
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:22,620
acid and try it and they cut off funding
or,

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,890
you know,
it's like I respect that,

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,850
the,
the effort,

13
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:31,400
but at the same time or how does she do
that?

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,120
Right.
And however you get another dolphin,

15
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,280
you know,
maybe you just have to,

16
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,660
you don't have to live with the golf and
the game and there's gotta be a better

17
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:40,280
way.
I think they were of in that dolphin was

18
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:41,680
the fucking happy.
I can't imagine.

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,361
It was like,
this is great.

20
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:44,790
I'm living with a lady.
I don't know if he thought it was bad.

21
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,170
I mean,
we have this big hang up about

22
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,720
sexuality.
But imagine if you had an itch on your

23
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,990
back and you couldn't reach it and you
know you were being taken care of by

24
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,340
someone and they scratched your back
before you,

25
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:54,210
you're like,
oh thank you.

26
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:56,300
I just mean I would always lean towards
like fun,

27
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,030
put the dog that,
I mean I'm,

28
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:00,420
I'm more of a don't jerk and animal off
kind of a guy,

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,960
but I just mean there's,
my point is well then maybe get a better

30
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:06,620
facility to keep the Dolphin and get a
couple of dolphins,

31
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:08,210
let them live,
put them in a,

32
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,930
I don't know.
I mean you know anytime you have an

33
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,490
animal in captivity it's pretty fucked
up.

34
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:13,830
But I don't know that jerking him off is
the right way to do it.

35
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,490
She's totally run.
Would you do,

36
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,790
which was if you had to choose an animal
that jerk off,

37
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,170
which is not a,
you know,

38
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,400
a lot of people ask me this question.
I would not do it at the monkey cause if

39
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:27,060
you do it wrong then bite you.
I think deal with a monkey would be a

40
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:29,960
little bit too much,
like just doing it with a dude rough and

41
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:32,460
he was like an off a monkey and they
just fucking sunk their teeth of your

42
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:36,690
thumb.
I don't like ball exotic.

43
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:40,230
I'd go like giraffe because it's tall.
You could stand,

44
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:41,850
you know,
but they might come and kick you in the

45
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,290
head.
They might look,

46
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,000
there's always a risk.
There's always a risk.

47
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:50,001
When he was checking in producer the
daily show,

48
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,100
no one said it was
dyed jerking off a donkey.

49
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,400
But I think it's a terrible way to go
cause they're so cute.

50
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,170
Do you know the rape a lot?
Yeah.

51
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,350
Really little bears are famous for
raping each other.

52
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:04,851
Well,
there you go.

53
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:07,620
A vicious,
they when they fuck they bite and really

54
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:10,860
fucking get crazy.
I did not know that.

55
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,940
Yeah,
you don't want to jerk off.

56
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,520
That's what I'm saying.
Don't bite you.

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,130
Bite the shit.
I wouldn't need to sleep on this.

58
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:18,680
I'll let you guys know.
Yeah,

59
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,723
let's,
uh,

60
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,760
let's put this to a test.
I mean,

61
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,860
what she did was ridiculous but only
ridiculous by our cultural standards.

62
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,710
If you think about it like biologically,
the real issue biologically is,

63
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:30,110
you're right.
Like you shouldn't have a dolphin and

64
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:31,320
captivity like that.
That's all.

65
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,250
But in the,
uh,

66
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,110
the podcasts,
they started document why they did it

67
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,510
because it was,
it's really hard to communicate with

68
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:38,010
dolphins in the wild.
Yeah.

69
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,300
I did this thing in Hawaii recently
where we went swimming with the

70
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:43,560
dolphins.
I had my four year old with me too,

71
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,600
and she was in the water like right next
to me.

72
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:47,460
I literally,
I was holding onto her while we were

73
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:50,280
swimming and she's got the scuba mask on
and shit and she's,

74
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,240
you know,
snorkeling,

75
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:53,040
looking down while it's often swim
underneath it.

76
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,350
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,620
And they're wild.
These are not like sea world and

78
00:02:58,621 --> 00:02:59,740
they'll,
they'll sonar you like

79
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,860
it's fucking cool.

80
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,830
Get near you or they'll make like weird

81
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,540
noises and shit.
I like that.

82
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,610
The lady,
every time I talked to Carter to Maya

83
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,130
calculations,
he's saying jerk me off.

84
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,550
I've just listened to him.
I mean,

85
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:15,930
we don't know that for sure.
Trust me.

86
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,670
I speak to off and he wants to be jerked
off.

87
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,150
It's like seeing that woman went jogging
and Florida and she was,

88
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,770
you know,
it was like seven that night and she had

89
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:26,170
a long day at work.
She went right and she just dangled a

90
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,450
feed off the bridge.
I just got to dangle my feet.

91
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:31,510
I'm just fucking hot and an 11 foot
alligator was like,

92
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,590
I'm going to,
I'll take you now.

93
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,600
I'll be having you now.
Don't,

94
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,590
Oh,
you found it with no arms.

95
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,600
Took her arms.
Fuck yeah,

96
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,220
that's good.
Alligator was like,

97
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:43,160
I know I'm an alligator and usually I
don't do this cause the crocodiles do

98
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,900
it.
I'm going to do it today to you.

99
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,510
You're going to be the only three people
or four people of the year that's going

100
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:52,640
to be eaten by a fucking 11 foot dragon.
That'll be me.

101
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,510
You the weird that alligators,
they let them hang around because

102
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:56,950
they're not too aggressive.

103
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,750
It's like they're just docile and he
usually run from you that people don't

104
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,400
just decide to fucking kill them on
site,

105
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:07,420
but really everyone in Florida should be
in up in arms.

106
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,020
They should run out to the swamps and
gun those fucking dinosaurs down.

107
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,730
Like those are a bunch of kid eating dog
eating monster shit out of dogs and a

108
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,920
guy was walking his dog and they all get
it.

109
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:21,580
Didn't go for the dog when for the guy
just fucking Jesus.

110
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,190
Yeah,
they're just not as aggressive as crocs.

111
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,720
If they were crocs,
we would be killing them.

112
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:27,910
Leftlane right.
Crocodiles,

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,310
they found nial crocs in the everglades.
Stop it.

114
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,590
Yes they have.
There's a shoot on sight order.

115
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,620
I fucked dial crocodile people hadn't
used to have them as pets.

116
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,740
Nile crocodiles,
they don't know if they're breeding.

117
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,510
They don't.
Don't have any idea what their spot in

118
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:43,990
more than one Nile crocodile in the
everglades confirmed sightings.

119
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,070
They're saying straight up killers.
Yep.

120
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,190
You see them,
they kill them onsite.

121
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,950
Straight up come.
They will come right at you.

122
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:51,700
You are food as a here and there being
big.

123
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,150
Oh,
they get really bad.

124
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:55,090
Like that peace corps girl who was like,
oh,

125
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,590
they were in Kenya.
Well,

126
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:59,290
the crocodiles died out years ago.
She heard,

127
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,720
she heard,
she goes swimming.

128
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,640
The guy's like,
I don't know.

129
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:04,850
She's like,
I'm going in with the radio.

130
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,540
I'm a water baby.
30 seconds later I'll get to pull it on

131
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,930
her house.
Got My feet too.

132
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,380
There was a document or an article I was
reading about these people that were

133
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:18,040
canoeing in the Congo and the guy behind
washes,

134
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:21,070
the guy in front gets taken by the crock
with a Croc,

135
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:25,900
just rises up out of the water and
literally snatches the guy and spins the

136
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,400
canoe upside kayak rather.

137
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,990
Oh the sky.
And stuck in it and it like goes up and

138
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,720
down like a bobber and then pump and
then pops up.

139
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,040
No Guy.
That's it.

140
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,580
He doesn't see the guy over again.
The CROC just takes them out of the

141
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:40,414
water.
Yeah.

142
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,470
And just so the model of that story is
don't fucking Kayak in denial.

143
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,660
I mean in,
in the Congo,

144
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,600
you don't do that.
That would be the motto of that story.

145
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,480
Oh fucking are you out of your fucking
mind?

146
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,030
They're not like sharks.
They will bother you.

147
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:56,830
They come after you come after
everything.

148
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,480
That's what they're,
they're here for cleaning up.

149
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,500
I'll just sit in Uganda.
He saw,

150
