1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,830
Her low freak bitches watch is such a
scary thing though because compromising

2
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:09,960
the ability to think correctly to me is
one of the scariest things that could

3
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:10,794
happen to you.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,371
That was,

5
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:13,620
I had Lyme disease and one of the,

6
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,760
and I spent three years in bed,

7
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:15,910
but the worst part about life,

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,550
I was really sick.

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,590
That's where the flow research came from.

10
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,520
Yeah.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,730
I pulled myself out of it through surfing
in these crazy altered states that I

12
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:26,040
was having while I was surfing.

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,140
And my first question was,

14
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:29,190
what the fuck has got right?

15
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:29,911
Surfing is not,

16
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:33,900
I've known Carol for chronic autoimmune
conditions and why was having these

17
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,600
crazy altered state of consciousness
experiences while surfing?

18
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,530
That's where it started for me.

19
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,730
Um,

20
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,290
but with Lyme I law,

21
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,670
I mean I,

22
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,600
you go crazy.

23
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,250
You become extremely paranoid.

24
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:47,730
The most common misdiagnosis for
Lyme is paranoid schizophrenia.

25
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,710
So you become extremely paranoid.

26
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:53,520
I was hallucinating short term
memory gone longterm memory,

27
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,480
gone beam dyslexic.

28
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,314
I couldn't write,

29
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,420
I couldn't even read cause I would
get to the end of a sentence.

30
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:59,130
I couldn't remember the beginning
of the sentence that I read.

31
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,650
But it's like watching yourself go mad.

32
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,783
I don't know of any,

33
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,380
I don't,

34
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,160
but I've been through
a lot of physical pain.

35
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:06,720
I've been through a lot of
different illnesses and whatever.

36
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,060
Nothing is worse than
watching yourself go crazy.

37
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,080
Wow are fine.

38
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,130
But my good friend Tommy,

39
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:15,780
his girlfriend just this past weekend
was telling me about she had Lyme and she

40
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:16,860
was misdiagnosed.

41
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,970
She had to go to just more than a,

42
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,010
I think she said more than a dozen
different doctors before somebody finally

43
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:23,610
listened to her.

44
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,530
If you find it out,

45
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,410
my second book,

46
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:26,041
west of Jesus,

47
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,210
which is the book I write about this,

48
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,230
this is very early.

49
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,090
It's the first couple of pages on,

50
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,360
I have a list of all the diseases
that I was told I had before.

51
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,830
They actually discovered
his lime and it's,

52
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,101
you know,

53
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:39,900
it's a half a page of diseases.

54
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:40,734
It's just,

55
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,470
I'm so confused by that
because Lyme is common.

56
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,430
So as well,

57
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:44,760
I,

58
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,810
first of all I was,

59
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,703
I had it,

60
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,540
I got it on the east coast,

61
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,650
but I was here.

62
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,490
I was living in California,

63
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:53,310
I was living in La at the
time where they hadn't really,

64
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,300
now they've seen it,

65
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,050
but at that time nobody had really seen
it and they didn't believe it was a west

66
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:58,861
coast disease.

67
00:01:58,861 --> 00:01:59,400
And you know,

68
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,600
it's still this point that diagnostics
are not fantastic for Lyme.

69
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,441
But what I was saying,

70
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,490
my friend Katie,

71
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,181
my friend,

72
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:07,200
Tommy's girlfriend Katie,

73
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,840
she lives in New Jersey
or Connecticut rather,

74
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,370
where it's really common.

75
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,310
I mean like Connecticut
is where it came from.

76
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:16,290
So they live in a place
where it's really common in,

77
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:16,990
the doctor was like,

78
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,823
Matt,

79
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,690
not lying.

80
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:18,991
She's like,

81
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:19,824
I think it might be like,

82
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,340
nope,

83
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,120
not what I'm,

84
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,953
you're going crazy.

85
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,943
I went in,

86
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,410
I don't know if I could talk about this,

87
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,670
I can't talk about this a little bit,

88
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:28,800
but so that we'll keep names out of it.

89
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,370
So the first time I walked
in to see my doctor,

90
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,091
um,

91
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:35,760
I've been sick for a while and I
just moved to La so I didn't have,

92
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:36,840
or a regular practitioner.

93
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:39,330
I finally got one and I've
been sick for a while.

94
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:42,240
So a lot of my friends had been trying
to figure out what the hell was going on

95
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,421
me.

96
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,860
And one of my editors said,

97
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:44,460
Hey,

98
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,300
I've been doing research.

99
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:45,870
I think,

100
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,630
I think we have Lyme.

101
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,550
Go ask your doctor.

102
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,640
And I remember walking into the doctor's
the first time I'd seen him and I was

103
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:51,150
like,

104
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,571
hey man,

105
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:51,720
I,

106
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,010
you know,

107
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:52,381
Blah Blah Blah.

108
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,214
This is what's going on.

109
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,970
Uh,

110
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,960
I think I have Lyme.

111
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:55,381
And he's like,

112
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:55,560
no,

113
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:55,740
no,

114
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,371
you don't have Lyme,

115
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:57,204
you have aids.

116
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,213
Which by the way,

117
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,303
like,

118
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,700
you know,

119
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,330
I was like,

120
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,730
are you sure cause decided you were gay?

121
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,331
No,

122
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:04,750
I looked at him,

123
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,021
I was like,

124
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:09,610
are you sure be so my mother was one of
the very first AIDS activists in Ohio.

125
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,780
So like I've been having protected
sex my whole life or baby.

126
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,520
Yeah,

127
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:15,791
true.

128
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,280
That heterosexual,

129
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,390
no intervenous drug use.

130
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:21,070
And he said that time and you know,

131
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,030
almost any dudes,

132
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,540
nothing,

133
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,020
nothing,

134
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,231
nothing,

135
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:23,620
nothing,

136
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:23,981
nothing,

137
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:24,311
nothing.

138
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:24,930
At that point,

139
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,140
you know,

140
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm willing to learn if you'll
send me someplace special.

141
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,011
But,

142
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:28,844
uh,

143
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,090
so this guy to sign,

144
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:32,920
this guy just looks at
me and the word gay.

145
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,400
No,

146
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,780
I thought I was like,

147
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,111
I was like,

148
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:35,381
buddy,

149
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,470
I'm not like I haven't add homosexual sex.

150
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:39,490
I've never used Ivy.

151
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,440
That was what happened.

152
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,280
And the worst thing is like,

153
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:45,671
you know,

154
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,130
go home to your girlfriend who
you're living with and she's like,

155
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:49,390
how was the doctor honey?

156
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,733
Hmm.

157
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,023
Yeah.

158
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,200
Did he test you before?

159
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:53,920
He said No.

160
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,551
He tested.

161
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:55,384
He tested.

162
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,890
That's just say I won the lawsuit.

163
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,761
Oh,

164
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:57,971
I know.

165
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,590
By the time it was all said and done,

166
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,311
Holy Shit,

167
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:01,144
you had a Su.

168
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:01,990
Wow.

169
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,460
It got really obnoxious.

170
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:05,860
I mean like they wouldn't
test me for anything.

171
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:05,961
It,

172
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:07,480
it dragged on and on and on

173
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,561
because they,

174
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:12,100
they're worried that if they do test you
for something and they confirmed that

175
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:15,430
they were incorrect and it sets them
up for malpractice so they're trying to

176
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:16,264
drag it out.

177
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,220
It was an Hmo.

178
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,053
Thanks.

179
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,970
Insurance has changed.

180
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:19,804
But back in the,

181
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,820
this was early 2000
[inaudible] 99 98 I paid,

182
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,030
I think my premium loose
HML cupboard was like,

183
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,690
let's say at the time it was like a
couple hundred bucks a month of that 200

184
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:32,380
bucks a month,

185
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,980
$7 went to the doctor for testing.

186
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:37,090
The rest of went to the insurance company.

187
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:40,000
The doctor got $7 a month to treat me.

188
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,420
So how incentivized our that are
run a bunch of big expensive tests.

189
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,200
So he looks at anybody
on an Hmo is like aids.

190
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,150
You got a these days,

191
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,360
get them to run out of my office.

192
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,490
Hopefully the guy will
just do drugs and die.

193
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,470
Just drink himself to death.

194
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:56,304
It was ugly.

195
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,731
Wow.

196
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:57,750
That's crazy.

197
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,790
So this was a long time ago when
lime wasn't nearly as prevalent.

198
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,620
Now Lyme is a God damn scary
disease because I don't
know when it originated and

199
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,460
they just started sort of treating
people for it over the last few decades.

200
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:11,910
Right.

201
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,350
I don't,

202
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,840
um,

203
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,250
I don't know if this is still true,

204
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:19,251
but there was a period of time where
it was the first of the second biggest

205
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:22,890
communicable disease viral
disease in the world.

206
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:23,780
He was second

207
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,260
eight.

208
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,411
Well,

209
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:25,700
one of the things I studied,

210
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,583
um,

211
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,270
I did this show called
a Joe Rogan questions,

212
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:30,470
everything for Psi Phi.

213
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,010
And one of the things that we looked into
with something called more challenge,

214
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:35,170
do you know what more challenges?

215
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,930
More Jaylen's is a very controversial
disease where people feel like they have

216
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:43,310
fibers growing out of their skin and
they scratch themselves and develop these

217
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:45,860
like open sores from itching.

218
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:49,910
And then they think that like they'll
get like carpet fibers in their skin,

219
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:51,620
they'll think it's
coming out of their body,

220
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,430
like we'll have like fibers from their
clothes that they'll detect on their

221
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:56,150
skin.

222
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,450
And so it has sort of weird
psychological aspect to it.

223
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,070
What's interesting about it
is a disproportionate number
of people who have more

224
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:07,670
challenge or believe they haven't
test positive for Lyme disease.

225
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,780
So I was talking to a
doctor who had more jealous,

226
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,450
who also has Lyme and he was
very candid and honest about it.

227
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:14,710
He,

228
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,300
he thinks that there's a direct risk.

229
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,770
There's something going on.

230
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:23,420
There was a neurotoxic effect that's
happening with the Lyme disease that's

231
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,920
twisting his mind.

232
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,330
Does,

233
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,020
I mean crazy?

234
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:27,381
I'll tell you.

235
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:28,070
I was at,

236
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,620
that's why I wanted to talk to
you that Fairfax and sunset.

237
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,421
I was driving my car,

238
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:32,900
it was just stick and it was,

239
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:34,070
I was coming back from the doctors.

240
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,600
This was a typical Lyme,

241
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,110
what happens to your brain and um,

242
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,300
the light's red and it's rush hour.

243
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:44,380
You know what Fairfax and sunset
is like at rush hour and uh,

244
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,740
the light turned from red to green
and I no longer know what green means.

245
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,430
Look,

246
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,600
my brain is just like,

247
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,681
and I'm like,

248
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:52,491
what am I supposed to do?

249
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:53,324
What am I supposed to do?

250
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,100
People are flocking and hawking.

251
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,450
And finally I'm like,

252
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,680
Oh crap.

253
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,850
Green means go.

254
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,030
And I looked down at the stick shift
and I no longer have not remember how to

255
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:02,864
drive stick.

256
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,920
I had to literally get out and people
had to push my car and to whatever that

257
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:08,980
little grocery store is
right there to the party.

258
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,570
So like,

259
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,390
you know,

260
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,480
fundamental skills that I'd
had since I was 16 years old.

261
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,381
And you know,

262
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:17,060
the ability to go when
the light turns green.

263
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,070
I mean you watch yourself go crazy.

264
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,810
Wow,

265
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,970
that must be insane.

266
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:24,080
But you knew how to walk.

267
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:24,980
You knew how to talk.

268
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:26,570
You need her to say
there's something wrong.

269
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,930
You had full access to the language
that had full access to land.

270
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:30,591
I couldn't write.

271
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:34,520
I started developing a select like
scrabble words up when I was writing,

272
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,391
but I could talk.

273
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:38,480
I don't think I ever lost my
powers of speech that I remember.

274
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,400
What a scary little fucking disease.

275
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,100
Lyme is,

276
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,540
was weird,

277
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,171
scary,

278
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,250
creepy disease.

279
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:43,761
Well,

280
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:44,600
this doctor,

281
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:47,210
he was absolutely convinced that
the two of them were correlated.

282
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,870
He said that there's something going
on with Lyme disease that produces this

283
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,150
thing where you,

284
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:55,340
you start seeing these fibers
coming out of your body and uh,

285
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:55,611
you know,

286
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:55,771
we,

287
00:07:55,771 --> 00:08:00,500
we had a ton of people like to send in
videos and show us images and they had

288
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,120
slides that they had prepared.

289
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:04,970
They were convinced these fibers
were coming out of their skin.

290
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:10,270
And so doctors oftentimes just completely
label it as a psychosomatic disorder.

291
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,460
But this one doctor who had it said,

292
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:17,420
I believe that the correlation is Lyme
disease and it completely makes sense.

293
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,710
Listen to what you're saying.

294
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,520
The other thing is everything
is a psychosomatic disease,

295
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,060
right?

296
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,331
I mean,

297
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:24,680
there's not an aids.

298
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,021
Well,

299
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:25,520
the mine,

300
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,570
all I was saying is that,

301
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,610
I don't mean it that way.

302
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,420
It's kind of funny now because it's a,

303
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,090
it's like you could kind of avoid,

304
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:36,380
it used to be,

305
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,790
we were all worried
everybody's going to die.

306
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,830
Like you can joke around about aids now,

307
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,933
which is rare.

308
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:41,630
You know,

309
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,190
if you look at like the,

310
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:46,040
the time when Magic Johnson
came out as HIV positive,

311
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,000
everybody was terrified.

312
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:47,900
We're all going to die.

313
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,650
You know,

314
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,630
I lost a lot of friends
during that period.

315
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,201
I'm sure you,

316
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,070
cause they thought you had aids.

317
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:52,401
No.

318
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:52,631
Okay.

319
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:53,464
So

320
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,160
I might've lost

321
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,300
some friends that way too.

322
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,343
But uh,

323
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,273
yeah.

324
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,490
But for you,

325
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,810
what did they have to do to you to
get you off the alarm disease and his,

326
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:09,360
isn't lime something you keep
semi-permanently so I mean,

327
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,740
I,

328
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:10,981
you know,

329
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:11,731
I was in bed for three.

330
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:12,700
I mean I'll tell you the year.

331
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,870
Yeah,

332
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,310
it was in bed for about three years.

333
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,030
They had to pull me off antibiotics
cause my stomach lining started bleeding

334
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:18,650
out.

335
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,110
Um,

336
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,530
there was nothing else maybe we could
do for me and up just tell you the full

337
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:24,810
story and I was going to end my life.

338
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:25,290
I like,

339
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,110
I was at that point I was
functional but 10% of the time,

340
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:29,340
maybe like an hour a day,

341
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,360
I couldn't work.

342
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,390
The only thing I was going to be was
a burden to my friends and my family.

343
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,650
And I was just like,

344
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,190
alright,

345
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,700
at the time,

346
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,530
30,

347
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,363
um,

348
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,280
and uh,

349
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,660
in the middle of this I was,

350
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,651
it was what,

351
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:41,880
I was still living in Los Angeles.

352
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,800
A friend of mine showed
up at my door and said,

353
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:44,634
we're going surfing.

354
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,350
I secured to your fucking mind.

355
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:48,510
I can't walk across the room.

356
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:48,781
I mean,

357
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:53,100
I literally couldn't do it and she
wouldn't shut up and wouldn't leave and

358
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:53,940
wouldn't leave and wouldn't,

359
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,810
he's trying and after like it just hard
to make a point of she's going to drown

360
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:01,020
me four hours of this
or three hours a day.

361
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:01,740
I was like,

362
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,573
fuck it,

363
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,870
let's go surfing today.

364
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:04,260
I mean,

365
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,550
what's the worst that can happen?

366
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:05,701
Right.

367
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:10,020
I'll always kill myself tomorrow
and a drag me out to sunset beach.

368
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,270
And they literally sort of
had to walk me to the car.

369
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,950
I take it,

370
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,160
you know,

371
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,731
by the shoulders.

372
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:15,031
Cause I was,

373
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:15,481
it was really,

374
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,314
we,

375
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:16,591
you know,

376
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,990
they gave me a fourth the size of
a Cadillac in the bigger the board,

377
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:19,960
the easier it is to surf.

378
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,810
And this was enormous
and it was a tiny day.

379
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:25,200
Like waves were like two feet
at best and was so crappy.

380
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,190
Nobody was even out,

381
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,080
but the water was warm
and they sort of like,

382
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:30,540
they took me by the elbow and they
walked me out to the break and I was out

383
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,280
there and I knew how to surf a little bit.

384
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:34,350
It had been a longtime
side surfed at that point,

385
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:37,500
but 30 seconds later or
wave came and you know,

386
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:38,281
I don't know what happened.

387
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:39,530
Muscle memory took over whatever would,

388
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,380
I spun my board,

389
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:44,460
I paddled a couple times and I popped up
and I just popped up from a dimension I

390
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,390
didn't even know existed.

391
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,080
Right.

392
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,460
So when the eye panoramic vision,

393
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:52,461
I felt like I could see out of the
back of my head and I felt amazing.

394
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,940
I felt like that kind of full
thrum of lifetime and slow down.

395
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,290
None of it made any sense.

396
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,190
It felt so good.

397
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,350
I caught like four more waves that day.

398
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:02,380
And by the fifth wave I was just,

399
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,223
I was disassembled.

400
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,670
They kinda put me back in
the car and drove me home.

401
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,390
And,

402
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:06,600
uh,

403
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,080
I was so sick after that that I was,

404
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:13,470
I got into bed and people had to bring
me food for like two weeks because I

405
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,640
couldn't walk to my kitchen,

406
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,780
which was like 60 feet
away and just exhausted.

407
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,740
I was not surfing experience
like the 15th Day,

408
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:21,120
which is the day I could walk again,

409
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,400
caught another ride back to the beach.

410
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,503
And I did it again.

411
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,350
Right.

412
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,681
And again,

413
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:28,560
I had this crazy altered state
of consciousness experience.

414
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:29,371
And you know,

415
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:29,701
again,

416
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:30,750
I was disassembled this time,

417
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:34,320
maybe it was like 13 days that
I was in bed and I did it again.

418
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:37,080
And over the course of about six to
eight months where the only thing I was

419
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:38,640
doing differently in my life was surfing.

420
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,080
I went from about 10% functionality
to about 80% functionality.

421
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,110
So my first question is
the fuck is going on,

422
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:46,351
right?

423
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:47,640
Like as I said earlier,

424
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,300
surfing is not a known cure for
chronic autoimmune conditions.

425
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:51,810
Right.

426
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,430
So,

427
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,050
and I lit out on a giant class.

428
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:57,340
The other thing was I
backgrounds as a science writer.

429
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:02,341
So like I don't have quasi mystical
experiences and I sure as hell don't have

430
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:03,220
them while surfing,

431
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,470
which has gotta be the flakiness,

432
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,171
you know,

433
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:06,100
thing ever.

434
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,580
Yeah.

435
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,050
And,

436
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,540
um,

437
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,260
so I really believed that even
though I was feeling better lives,

438
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:13,120
only fatal if it gets into your brain.

439
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,283
And I was,

440
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,800
I was pretty sure that even though I was
starting to feel physically better that

441
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:20,710
the disease had crept into my brain
because why else would I be having these

442
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:22,210
mystical experiences?

443
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,610
I must be totally losing my mind.

444
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,210
I'm about to die.

445
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,420
And I lit out on a giant quest
beer at what the hell happened.

446
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,680
And you know,

447
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,250
very quickly discovered that these
states of consciousness have names.

448
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,300
We call them flow states.

449
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,840
And the version of what
happened to me health wise,

450
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,620
um,

451
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,890
and this is her Benson did some of
the work on the neurobiology of this.

452
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:42,724
He's at Harvard.

453
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,090
Um,

454
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,990
he wrote about it in his book,

455
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:44,800
the breakup principle.

456
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,633
But,

457
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:46,990
uh,

458
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,220
all the neurochemicals
that show up and float,

459
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,021
two things happen.

460
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:50,651
So one,

461
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,180
when you move into flow,

462
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,310
there's a global release of nitric oxide.

463
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,560
It's a gas as signaling
molecules anywhere in the body.

464
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,030
What it does is it flushes all the
stress hormones out of your system and it

465
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,920
pumps you full of these kind
of feel good performance.

466
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,010
Standard Lyme is an essentially
any autoimmune conditions,

467
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,890
your nervous system gone haywire.

468
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,050
So when you go into flow,

469
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,550
it resets your nervous system,

470
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,960
calms everything down.

471
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,110
It gets rid of all the stress
hormone and all that stuff and it,

472
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:17,980
and when,

473
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,160
the worst part about Lyme is you
don't even know where normal is.

474
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,550
Like it has been so long
since you have felt normal,

475
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:25,331
like you don't even,

476
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:26,530
you can't even find it on a map.

477
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,850
So suddenly like I was like,

478
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,803
oh,

479
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,160
this is what normal feels like.

480
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:30,371
Again,

481
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:31,204
the other thing is,

482
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:31,821
you know,

483
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:34,470
the positive neurochemicals
that show up and float dopamine,

484
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,180
Serotonin and Nanda Amaanah see Towson.

485
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:38,740
Those are all immune system boosters.

486
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:38,921
I mean,

487
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:40,030
they do a ton of other stuff,

488
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:41,530
enhance cognitive
performance and whatever,

489
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,300
but her Benson at Harvard,

490
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:44,920
and I think this may be overstretching,

491
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,290
uh,

492
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:45,741
a budget,

493
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,330
but he has kind of gone
on record and said,

494
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,460
he thinks most cases of so
called spontaneous healing
actually have a flow state

495
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:54,971
at their heart.

496
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:56,940
And it's this particular
process that's doing it.

497
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,943
Okay.
