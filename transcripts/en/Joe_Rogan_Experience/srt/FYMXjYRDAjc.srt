1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,730
Eagle right out your door and in the
most awesome hiking spot ever.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,590
And we're live,
ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,770
Thank you.
Thank you for joining MPR.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,053
Uh,
please,

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,420
no,
I don't want to do that.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,630
Brotzmann Jeff Evans,
but Brotzmann good friend of mine,

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,730
next door neighbor and uh,
Jeff Heavens,

8
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:19,070
his buddy who,
uh,

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,740
apparently has lived a fucking crazy
life rescuing people off of Everest,

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,760
traveling up there and bud told me we
were at this little carnival with our

11
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:27,330
kids.
It's like,

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,340
got to get this guy on.
Got To talk to him.

13
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:30,900
So no pressure.
Yeah.

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,330
Your arm got put by hunch your
shoulders.

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,920
No,
it didn't.

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,740
It sounded good.
I was interested in this asshole on how

17
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,600
did you get involved with,
first of all,

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,340
when was the first time you summited
everest?

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,320
2001.
God Damn Man.

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,850
How many times you've done it?
Just once.

21
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,810
Just put good on how to get a 1.5 cars
out of blonde dude with me.

22
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,770
Yeah.
So you took a blind dude all the way to

23
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:55,420
the top.
Why didn't you take them like halfway?

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,380
Yeah.
Below it is face.

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,330
Dude,
you made it.

26
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,420
You're one of the rare ones.
The funny part was we got to the top and

27
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:04,141
we were like,
man,

28
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:06,090
we could see the curvature of the earth
from here,

29
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:06,601
Bro.
When he goes,

30
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,250
I don't give a shit.
Like I want to get out of here.

31
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,240
I can't see anything I want to go.
That's actually not true.

32
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:13,200
What he said is,
Hey Eric,

33
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:15,050
take a look around,
take a look around,

34
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,260
take a look around instinctual or were
you just fucking with them?

35
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,570
I mean,
I think it was a little bit of both.

36
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,180
I kind of instinctively fuck with him.
Right.

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,490
Um,
we've been bros for a long time.

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,070
I mean,
it's a very fraternal relationship that

39
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:29,904
we have.

40
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,450
So I by nature,
just sort of automatically fuck with

41
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,310
this guy.
I know I'll enjoy it and he enjoys it

42
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:38,760
back because he is super blonde dude.
Right?

43
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,470
Know the whole world,
loves,

44
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,191
loves him.
Some.

45
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:43,530
Eric,
and I'm probably one of the few people

46
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:45,150
that just kick him in the nuts,
you know,

47
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,610
giving a little bit of a hard time.
Yeah.

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,690
Yeah.
If you're a blind to the climbs Mount

49
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,950
Everest people just give you a free
pass,

50
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,840
a lot of stuff,
and suddenly that he claimed.

51
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:52,910
What else do you claim?
Well,

52
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:57,270
he's done a bunch of stuff,
but he just kayaked the Grand Canyon two

53
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:00,270
years ago in his own boat,
the whole thing.

54
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,050
277 miles.
What did you have a guy behind him going

55
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:04,650
left?
Right,

56
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,483
left,
right.

57
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,840
They had,
you know,

58
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:09,270
these ear pieces and you know,
he asked me to go,

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,990
I'll climb everest,
but I sure it's fucking,

60
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:13,170
I'm going to take you down the Grand
Canyon.

61
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,290
There's something that people really
love about someone risking their life

62
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,630
and then pulling it off.
Right.

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,700
Something,
assuming you pull it off.

64
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,271
Yeah.
Assuming,

65
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:22,051
yeah.
If you don't,

66
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:24,930
then you make one of those instagram
greatest fails.

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,300
Yeah.
They were telling us before we went up

68
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:28,080
there,
like,

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,390
you know,
blind who's going to die and when he

70
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:32,340
does,
what'd you think was gonna Happen?

71
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,780
They were telling me.
Oh yeah,

72
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,210
we heard that.
The sherpas are who?

73
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:35,671
No,
no.

74
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,890
Just the Everest experts.
You know,

75
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,980
this member,
this is back in oh one this was whenever

76
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:42,190
it was Sushi.
Yes.

77
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,670
Two little bit.
Little bit more raw than it is now.

78
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,520
How is that?
What,

79
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,700
what has happened?
Because on the outside,

80
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,360
what I've seen is all the expos,
a's that show all the human waste that

81
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,880
they leave behind and including actual
shit,

82
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,690
right?
Tents and people pay people to kind of

83
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,100
do all the hard work and then you just
kind of show

84
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,230
up and still hard.
Right?

85
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,930
But not as hard.
You got to put in,

86
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,060
you know,
you've got to put it in his steps.

87
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,590
We've got to put in the work.
But it's so commercialized that it's

88
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,410
been,
it's been diluted to a certain extent.

89
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,820
And you know,
I'm,

90
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,770
I am a Sherpa advocate to the core,
you know,

91
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,600
these guys do the work.
I mean they put it in every single day

92
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,880
there humping the loads.
They're cooking the food,

93
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:31,990
they're setting the lines there,
they're taking the biggest risk and then

94
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:33,490
allowing,
you know,

95
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:37,720
other folks to move through a little bit
more effectively and faster and not have

96
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:41,260
to expend as much energy.
And so over the we Kinda,

97
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,260
we kinda got in there and no one towards
I think,

98
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,280
I think on the head ahead of the curve
just a little bit as to when it started

99
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:51,850
to sort of change the face of Everest
changed a little bit.

100
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,780
So how did they make it easier?
Like what do they do that made it more

101
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:56,920
commercial?
Yup.

102
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,690
Um,
no money number one gets in there and,

103
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,570
and pays a lot more sherpas to do a lot
more work.

104
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,690
Um,
so the lines are fixed.

105
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,010
The weather forecasting models are more
effective and more efficient and say the

106
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:14,320
lines are fixed and the lines are fixed,
meaning the ropes,

107
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,880
the ropes on the mountain.
Oh,

108
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,730
there's fixed Dan,
you clip in.

109
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,300
Yeah,
you clip into a rope so when you go up,

110
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,680
okay.
So the ropes are there.

111
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:22,810
Before you get there,
all you have to do is just kind of like

112
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,300
huff it.
So it's not like before.

113
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,500
So you kind of,
wow,

114
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:28,480
that's weird.
So it's almost like you're on like a

115
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,590
theme park,
like an Everest.

116
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,410
It's,
you're still an everest and you still

117
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:33,760
could get fucked up by an avalanche.

118
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,870
Right?
There's no question.

119
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,450
It's very dangerous.
There's no way to mitigate all of that.

120
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,770
But you know,
it's uh,

121
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,110
it,
it has been,

122
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,980
it has been eased up a little bit.
The edges have been taken off just a

123
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:47,350
slight bit,
but it also adds that they're dangerous

124
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:49,000
because one of them,
if I was looking at it,

125
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,850
it's sometimes more dangerous now
because there's lines,

126
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,260
there's sometimes 300 people,
600 people in a line and you're waiting

127
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:59,590
from some asshole who didn't train and
you're watching him trying to climb up

128
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,950
this little 20 foot cliff and they don't
know how to work at Gmr.

129
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,380
They can't climb.
What's a Jew Mar to hand to hand things

130
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:08,170
in the sending device.
It's like a one way of sending device to

131
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:11,590
go up a rope so you can slide it up and
it catches on the way down pull.

132
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:12,910
But there people go up there.

133
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,010
And when we were up there,
they had people,

134
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:18,040
they've literally,
without talking shit about tracking

135
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,330
companies,
there are some companies like,

136
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,440
all right,
we're going to show you how to put your

137
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:21,550
crampons,
um,

138
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,360
as you're going in the icefall if she
christ.

139
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:24,850
Yeah.
They've,

140
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,380
they've learned like we're going to
learn,

141
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:28,270
we're going to,
they've never had crampons before.

142
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,820
We had to Jeff,
not me.

143
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,270
Jeff had to rescue risk his life and
helicopters going to high,

144
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:37,300
high altitude to pick up people who
shouldn't no business on the mountain.

145
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,200
So they didn't manage to get their body
acclimated.

146
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,010
Is that what the issue is?
They didn't put in the the

147
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:49,810
apprenticeship cause you know,
and nowadays the commercial component

148
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,020
allows folks that have enough money to
pay and then show up and get guided

149
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,070
basically to the top.
So back in the day it was,

150
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:03,050
you know,
if you didn't have your teeth cut,

151
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,070
you know,
you,

152
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,970
you,
uh,

153
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,290
you know,
it was on you.

154
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,590
And nowadays you can just show up and,
and you know,

155
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:13,070
generally someone will be taken care of
you whether it's a god or whether it's a

156
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,510
Sherpa.
Uh,

157
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,920
and so yeah,
it's,

158
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:17,210
it's changed.
Um,

159
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,200
but you know,
I don't,

160
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,630
I don't want to take anything from the
folks who still go out there.

161
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,640
It's a dream for so many people,
you know,

162
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:26,780
and it's still an aspiration and a in a,
in a life goal for,

163
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,540
you know,
a lot of folks and it's still very

164
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,130
difficult.
And so for instance,

165
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:33,980
last year we just saw,
I mean we saw a really nice cross

166
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:36,680
section of,
of skilled,

167
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,010
experienced climbers trying it,
but then we saw a shit show,

168
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,470
you know,
we saw a lot of folks who should have

169
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:44,540
been on other peaks first and then they
weren't,

170
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,150
they skipped to the top,
you know,

171
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,350
you know anything in life,
you know,

172
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:51,950
you,
you bypass the work and you get smoked.

173
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,750
Yeah.
And we did a,

174
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:54,950
we,
our rescue team,

175
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,830
ars rescue team,
our five Sherpas did the highest

176
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:01,790
altitude rescue in history at 28,500 off
the balcony and a girl,

177
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,960
husband.
And wife.

178
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,820
I don't know if they did.
Did she summit?

179
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,580
I don't think she summited though.
Um,

180
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,000
as she was coming down the summit,
some of the 29 35,

181
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,910
she's at 28,
500 and she decided to sit down.

182
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,800
Husband left her,
she's tapped out.

183
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,420
How's the left foot?
People quit.

184
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,590
People quit.
So she sat down,

185
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,550
but she sat down and he left her.
Yeah.

186
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,690
Oh wait,
there's more to that story.

187
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:27,280
So he left her and then we go rescue.
Or should he say,

188
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,090
sit right here.
I'll come back in a couple of days.

189
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:30,710
This is up for questions.
It's like there,

190
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,870
there's two ways to look at,
we were talking about this last night

191
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:36,950
was she may have just been a tap out
bitch and just said,

192
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,640
I quit.

193
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,560
And he tried to employ,
please come out,

194
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:40,191
come out,
come on.

195
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:42,020
And finally just left her.
That's one scenario.

196
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,600
The other scenario is,
um,

197
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,610
you know,
he just was like,

198
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,870
peace out.
Good luck.

199
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:49,550
I'm out.
Here's the problem.

200
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,980
I do it this way and I understand about
diving.

201
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:55,250
So let's say you and I are diving.
We're 300 feet below the blow the water

202
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,760
right and my air goes out and I know we
can buddy breathe,

203
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,430
but let's pretend there's nobody
breathing and you're going to stick

204
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:04,370
around and watch me die and you're gonna
end up dying or I'm going to grab a hold

205
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:05,890
of you and grab your regulator and
you're,

206
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,130
you're,
we're both going to die.

207
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,580
You can't help anybody at that level.
You can't,

208
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,930
you're,
you're tired.

209
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,590
Your body is eating itself.
You're basically dying in the death

210
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:17,960
zone.
He could explain that basically.

211
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,180
And if your,
if your wife says,

212
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,910
I'm sitting down,
I'm going to get up in five minutes,

213
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:26,570
you go ahead and she's got a Sherpa with
her and then you go,

214
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,460
I go ahead and you get back to camp
four,

215
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:31,640
which is exactly what happened.
Get down to camp four and look around

216
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:32,474
you.
Why it's not there.

217
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,450
Holy Shit.
And then they call us and they wake jeff

218
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:37,070
and I up and were like,
you're going to what?

219
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,880
So I was,
I was with her right at base camp when

220
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:42,980
she,
when we delivered her to her husband and

221
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,800
I was trying to gauge like,
is he going to be one of these guys?

222
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,000
It's like,
oh my God,

223
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:49,880
I'm so glad you're alive.
Or Holy Shit,

224
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:50,714
she's alive.

225
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,643
Fuck.
You know.

226
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,810
And I think it was the former,
I think he was really ecstatic.

227
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:58,710
He was crying.
Remember?

228
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,660
He was really,
he was really upset.

229
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,560
But then hold on all they'd say,
no,

230
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,091
no,
no,

231
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:06,910
no.
It goes back because actually the first

232
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,200
first kick in the balls,
so without taking the whole thing to

233
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,260
this.
So what had to happen is,

234
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,370
as Jeff and I and our base camp manager,
Anthony had to take for Sherpas from

235
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:21,510
camp to or can't for,
took two Sherpas and then two more in

236
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,760
the middle of the night.
So six o'clock,

237
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:25,980
seven o'clock at night,
the most dangerous type winds are

238
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:29,070
blowing 30 40 miles an hour.
It's 20 degrees below zero.

239
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,010
Nobody,
nobody's ever done.

240
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,870
You don't do it.
And we sent them up there and we said,

241
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,500
can you go get her?
Oh God.

242
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,040
So,
and you've got to find this person on

243
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:38,640
the line.

244
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,340
So they walked and they kept walking and
they kept walking.

245
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,050
And we have video.
Remember meagan was video.

246
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,580
How long does it take to get up the
line?

247
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:48,180
Like how normal normal human being you,
the three of us,

248
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,040
how long would it take for three of us
to get from the south call to where she

249
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:57,090
was pro three or four hours if you're in
shape.

250
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:59,670
So take me out of that because I'm not a
runner.

251
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,890
Yeah.
But I'm not doing any high altitude

252
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,830
hiking.
Gimme five hours.

253
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:05,371
Okay.
So,

254
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,280
so it's like very dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.

255
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,450
Especially at night.
At the worst.

256
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,400
Getting it out.
Yeah.

257
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,020
At the worst time.
Not even no one,

258
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,580
no one knows where she is now,
but the terrain dictates that she has to

259
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:19,530
be,
unless she's fallen off the side,

260
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:22,470
she's on a spine basically.
And,

261
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,270
and you know,
if you go up the ridge,

262
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,170
you're either going to find her if she's
alive or she's tossed off the side.

263
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,750
So she,
and also she's dealing with super low

264
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,340
air,
no air squeezing,

265
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,700
extremely cold.
Nowhere bringing third of what you got

266
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,660
from,
they bring tanks.

267
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,070
Yeah.
But her era was gone.

268
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,080
So you're drinking your,
your,

269
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,340
your,
she brought no air with her or she

270
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,320
brought with her.
She's done.

271
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,950
She was abandoned basically.
So they left her.

272
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:47,850
So you know,
generally you would have somebody with

273
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:49,680
an extra tank to be able to help her
out.

274
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,800
But I get the sense that she just said
I'm done.

275
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,590
And she sat down and everybody tried to
kiss me and then no one,

276
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,200
no one could get her to get and want to
walk back with her.

277
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,743
Can't,
you can't,

278
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,420
you can't carry [inaudible] 29,000 feet,
28,000 feet.

279
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,270
So keep going.
So she,

280
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,000
the oxygen up there,
33% less than what's here at sea level.

281
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,220
33% 33% so at 67% less authored.

282
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,610
Yeah.
Wow.

283
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,070
Normal auction.
She was no auction,

284
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,970
so she sat down.
So the boys,

285
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:20,760
we have gopros on him.
We had special cameras and pockets and

286
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:23,700
all kinds of weird shit to film on the
mountain and the boys are walking.

287
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,970
I have footage of a Mingma Mingma's
walking up there and he's going,

288
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,100
I swear to God,
I'll,

289
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,730
I'll say this for you.
He speaks decent English the whole time

290
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:33,750
and I'll,
I'll send you the clip.

291
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,130
It's the funniest clip you ever seen.
He's,

292
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:37,980
I'm like God damn mother fucking fucking
fucking mother.

293
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:42,630
And He's discussing every step of the
way he's fucked up scenario and you

294
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:43,800
know,
it's middle of the night and he's

295
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,120
looking at,
you know,

296
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,150
potentially dead person in the death
zone.

297
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,980
Yeah.
In the desks.

298
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,230
A cool situation to tie.
Why is it the death zone?

299
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,550
Because of the,
because of the lack of oxygen,

300
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,220
your body's body starts to conspire
against you.

301
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,090
I mean you,
you,

302
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,550
you know,
you can't assimilate any nutrition.

303
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:01,384
You know,
you're,

304
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,830
the fluid in your body starts to go to
places it's not supposed to go.

305
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,330
So it goes up in your brain and you get
cerebral edema and you make that

306
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:12,640
decisions and you get a headache and you
lose your vision.

307
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:15,400
And then you get pulmonary edema.
Your lungs fill up with fluid and you

308
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,460
drown in your own fluid.
You know,

309
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:18,294
it's,
it's uh,

310
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,130
this is like stepping out of the state
capitol and Mars and I wonder what this

311
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:23,200
is going to do to my body.
And you step out and shit starts

312
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:23,921
popping.
It's,

313
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:25,370
it's strange up there.
Wow.

314
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,360
They've done MRI studies.
Actually that's where it is right there.

315
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,510
This was the line that Jamie pulled up
over to the red zone.

316
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:34,540
Lack of oxygen above 8,000 meters can be
fatal to climbers.

317
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,120
So see that labs and feet is fucking
high.

318
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,250
8,000 meters.
That is,

319
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,220
that's the same.
See that last dot before the summit?

320
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:45,520
That's 26,000 feet,
which is right there.

321
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,631
Exactly,
Jamie.

322
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:48,850
That does that.
Where she goes above.

323
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,580
That's what the campaign up and that's
the balcony.

324
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:54,190
Right.
And she was almost there 500 feet.

325
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,620
She was 500 feet from the top.
She may have,

326
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,880
who knows?
I don't know if she made it.

327
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,240
She was,
she was a 28,500 we have a gps

328
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,850
coordinates on it.
She was at 28,005 to 500 feet from the

329
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,770
top.
So she could almost say she summited

330
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,240
Everest.
She was like,

331
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:10,300
she could see like Everest was like
where your car's parked.

332
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,970
Yeah.
Except things.

333
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,970
A lot of crazy ass terrain in between
where she was and across.

334
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,740
That's where the Hillary step is.
And that's where the ridge goes.

335
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:21,430
It's no louder than your laptop and
sections and it's a 10,000 foot drop

336
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:22,240
into Tibet.

337
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,300
Right.
And a 6,000 foot dropping it in Nepal to

338
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:27,190
the left.
Either way it would hurt pretty fucking.

339
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:30,280
This is wine is a laptop in sections.
It's pretty,

340
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,690
pretty narrow,
you know,

341
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,020
but then it wa it,
it opens up and it,

342
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,590
and it shrinks down.
But I mean it's no place to screw the

343
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:41,410
pooch and she did.
So,

344
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,040
oh my God.
So this is right here.

345
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,760
Unless the Hillary step right there,
which by the way,

346
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,310
it was really interesting two years ago.
I remember the earthquake two years ago

347
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:52,930
in the fall.
So it knocked that whole boulder off

348
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,310
that boulder that people are standing
out.

349
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,240
Right.
So Hillary Sta.

350
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,500
Imagine if you're on that,
you're like,

351
00:13:56,501 --> 00:14:00,580
I made it
go on for the ride.

352
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,590
That's at the peak of Everest.
Their Nav.

353
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,400
You Bro,
I'll fucking hop off and grab a hold of,

354
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,460
maybe you bro.
So that's,

355
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:10,690
look at that.

356
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,580
Look at that clown show.
Oh my God.

357
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,700
So many people.
So if someone falls onto you,

358
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,260
you got a real problem too.
Yeah.

359
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:20,830
So the year we were up there in 2000 the
year before the fall,

360
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:23,260
before there was a British guy,
I can't remember his name,

361
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:27,250
but he got caught up in the ropes
descending from the summit down the

362
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:30,760
hillary step and got caught and there
was nobody there with him.

363
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,300
And he got caught caught and he got
stuck in perpetuity.

364
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,470
So we thought that for sure the first
people that were going up and oh one

365
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,550
that were like a few weeks before us had
to cut him free cause we were,

366
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,450
you know,
we're speculating.

367
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:52,940
Like if we're the first group that gets
up there going to have to scoot around,

368
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,900
uh,
this fella,

369
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,510
you know,
so he's just stuck on this line.

370
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,210
But he wasn't there when we got up
there.

371
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,470
He wasn't somebody who already come
from.

372
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,620
Yeah.
Now what did they do?

373
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:01,760
Push them off the side.
Well,

374
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:05,670
here's something for Jamie.
So there's 248 bodies on Everest right

375
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,680
now.
Still there.

376
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,390
And these climbers,
I didn't go up.

377
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,770
I was at base camp [inaudible] the
climbers use them as mark markers.

378
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,530
You kind of go up here.
There's the original climber.

379
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,330
The guy for the first kind of make it,
well,

380
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:18,170
they found one.
Yeah,

381
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:21,200
but he's on the south summit.
He's on the other side on the north side

382
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:26,201
and Ted Malerie malerie they found
Mallory's body body back.

383
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:28,400
Right.
Is back until they're frozen.

384
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,440
They're weird.
Yeah.

385
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,400
Ivory skin still flesh like,
yeah.

386
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,640
Still flush their fleets.
Cryogenically frozen.

387
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:39,230
The crows pick at them,
they eat them.

388
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,790
There's crows at that,
at that altitude.

389
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,100
They pick at him.
This guy,

390
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,720
mallory,
Jesus,

391
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:46,040
look at that.
That's so weird.

392
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,960
But that dude's a bad dude,
man.

393
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,320
That is a very bad man right there.
Because they went out with some hobnail

394
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:55,220
boots and some marginal equipment and
everybody was telling him that they were

395
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,740
going to be dead for sure.
And they said we're going to charge

396
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:58,940
ahead.
And they did.

397
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:01,580
I mean this was,
this was back way back,

398
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:02,810
man.
This was in the 20s.

399
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,650
Right.
So,

400
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,490
and there's the controversy that he,
that boot the controversy that they

401
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,050
summited first,
but they can't prove it.

402
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,170
So that's a big controversy.
They thought Irvine and Mallory summited

403
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,650
and then they fell on their way down.
So crows pick at him.

404
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,120
Oh yeah.
But what are the,

405
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:19,550
obviously he's still there.
Um,

406
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,181
yeah.
I mean,

407
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:22,400
I don't think get at him as much,
but there's,

408
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,450
you know,
there's things,

409
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:25,700
there's this,
there's a lot of stuff there,

410
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,460
you know,
I ain't get a lot of,

411
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:30,650
yeah,
there's a lot happening there that's

412
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:31,490
sitting on the mountain.

413
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,880
You have to walk past that.
I didn't see that guy.

414
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,710
But you've never seen that guy.
I didn't see that.

415
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,170
How many of the 200 plus bodies have you
seen?

416
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,930
You know,
the,

417
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,340
the,
the conditions changed so dramatically

418
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,790
over the each season depending on snow
fall.

419
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:49,220
So you know,
Jesus or some creepy things up there,

420
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,380
zoom out on that dude's face.
I mean there's,

421
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,090
it looks happy.
I made it.

422
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,440
I don't think he,
and you know that nice jacket that's

423
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:59,300
pretty fresh.
That's a nice looking down seat.

424
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,100
Yeah,
it's what I'm saying.

425
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,230
Like how many people die a year?
Well,

426
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,890
I think the average is,
you know,

427
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:09,110
nowadays is usually I think somewhere
under 10 but you know,

428
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,650
between six and 10 every season.
And how many people attempt it?

429
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,120
I didn't get it.
The,

430
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,760
the,
the grade is,

431
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,580
is increasing every year.
I think this year was the most,

432
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,400
it's summited,
the most attempted in most summited was

433
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:22,880
this year.

434
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,180
And I think close to 300 people,
some of the diseases pull that picture

435
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:28,400
up again,
that image of death star Sherpas and

436
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:30,680
regular folks.
So a lot of the Sherpas died too,

437
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:31,161
Huh?
Yeah.

438
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:33,620
Well I mean there they go.
They're higher in concentration.

439
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:35,940
They do the majority of the work as
well.

440
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,360
And,
and that's one of the reasons why we

441
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:38,900
went out there.
We saved more sherpas.

442
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,631
Um,
and we,

443
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:41,430
we pull a lot of Sherpas off cause we
need more,

444
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,400
more often than not,
they don't have helicopters and they'd

445
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:47,540
all have helicopter insurance.
And so we would go and I would pay for

446
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,374
it.
They would go,

447
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,640
there's a Sherpa who's really sick and
he's going to die.

448
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,470
And then jeff and I would just decide to
pull them off.

449
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,800
Thing they don't have is they don't have
life insurance.

450
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,540
And,
and you can imagine,

451
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,990
so a lot of these families,
a lot of the Nepali in the high altitude

452
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:02,040
workers,
families,

453
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,580
they lose their only source of income
when these guys get get killed.

454
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,190
So actually a friend of mine,
Melissa,

455
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:10,170
or not,
who was the first American woman to

456
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:14,040
summit Everest without oxygen?
Just uh,

457
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,230
last year,
um,

458
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,110
uh,
she started a fund called the junior per

459
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:24,111
fund and it actually compensates the
families when their loved ones or killed

460
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:26,490
on the mountain.
It's nice and it's good.

461
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:28,210
It keeps them straight because they
don't have a choice.

462
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,430
This is [inaudible] to you live on the
Lake Gail,

463
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,180
you're going to be a Sherpur reporter at
the highest level.

464
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:35,430
You can be your Sherpa.
You're a guide.

465
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,450
Wow.
So what happened?

466
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,660
This lady again?
Oh,

467
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,640
oh yeah.
So mean.

468
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,930
What goes up there?
They're walking up there and they need

469
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:43,710
some help.
So they,

470
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,600
they,
and I have it all on video and he's gone

471
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,180
fuck a motherfucker.
He passed.

472
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,130
So funniest thing in the world.
The comedy show.

473
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,680
So then they,
they hear music.

474
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,670
Not Kidding.

475
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,180
They hear music.
So she has a phone on her.

476
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,520
I don't know how the batteries lasting
and she's sitting at the balcony but on

477
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:06,630
the ice and just barely breathing and
listening to music.

478
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,030
And then so they go to her,
Brianna or some shit?

479
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,560
No,
I would say with some kind of Indian

480
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:15,270
music and
her curry rock or whatever the hell it

481
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,104
was.
Um,

482
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,700
and then she Indian?
Yeah,

483
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:18,810
she was Indian.
Her name was,

484
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:19,644
uh,
Chetna.

485
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,030
You don't want to say her name,
Huh?

486
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,740
Well,
no,

487
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,670
she'd been a disparaged her.
She's alive.

488
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,170
She's good.
She's stoked.

489
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:26,950
She started to me a Christmas card.
Okay.

490
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,871
Yeah.
No two of us.

491
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,381
Nice.
Yeah.

492
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:29,191
Very cool.
Okay.

493
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,780
Switch card with her kid.
So what happened?

494
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,930
So then they get to her and,
and then they start calling her momma.

495
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,620
They're like,
Mama,

496
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,550
Mama,
you need to wake up.

497
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,570
You need to wake up.
We didn't go.

498
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:37,261
And she's like,
no,

499
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:38,190
no.
It's all in video.

500
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,540
Like leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

501
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,970
I don't want to do it.
I don't want to do it.

502
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,890
I don't want to do it.
And then they put oxygen downer,

503
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,040
crank up the bottle,
try to get some blood flowing,

504
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,900
get stuff.
They sit up there at 8,000 feet,

505
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,810
35 minutes,
45 minutes trying to Jesus trying to

506
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:52,650
coax her.
Yup.

507
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,540
Trying to coax her to get her down and
that was it because of her personality

508
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:02,541
or is it because she's so like so
diminished cognitively things go south

509
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:06,000
to ride.
So she was,

510
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,250
she probably had pretty profound
cerebral edema.

511
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:10,650
So her decision making was in the
toilet.

512
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,610
So you become really apathetic.
It's impossible to carry someone down.

513
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,770
You can't carry something,
you can lower them down,

514
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:17,880
which is what happened.

515
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,490
You can tie a rope to their harness and
short rope.

516
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:22,020
I'm down with,
you know,

517
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,850
with two or three dudes like working
really,

518
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,990
really hard sort of loaner down and
that,

519
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,900
that's how they got her down.
But you know,

520
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,390
she,
she quit and a lot of people quit.

521
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,420
I worked search and rescue in Alaska on
Denali for years and,

522
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:38,160
and you'd be amazed at how many people
are just like done Tuesday,

523
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,360
just lay down and they're done because
they're not rational enough to know.

524
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:45,750
Like if I sit down and I just took just
a little bitty nappy and getting back

525
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:47,230
up,
you're taking the snow nap and you're

526
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,680
done.
No,

527
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,430
now,
yeah,

528
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,610
it won't snow now.
I don't like that.

529
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:56,050
So that's a weird term.
But with hypothermia,

530
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,960
the interesting thing that happens is
you get euphoric,

531
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,820
right?
You'd go through this,

532
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,870
this stage of super cold,
super cold,

533
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:06,250
and then your core temperature drops low
enough to where euphoria comes in.

534
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,600
So oftentimes it was same people,
we would find our undressed.

535
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,310
So you get hot,
you get warm.

536
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:16,210
So their gloves come off the hats,
pants andZ unzipped.

537
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:17,380
And you know,
everybody's,

538
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,770
everybody's buck naked on the side of
the mountain right before they die,

539
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:22,380
before they die.
So I mean,

540
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,210
not that I want to go out that way,
but now I can think of worst way.

541
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:29,200
So it gets you for it apparently.
Wow.

542
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,870
Because we also pull people back.
I've seen multiple times when we pulled

543
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:37,450
people back and they discussed that,
they described it.

544
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,660
Um,
and then we start rewarming there,

545
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:42,990
frostbite and shit's not right after
that.

546
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,920
That hurts out.
That hurt.

547
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,390
Frostbite is so horrible to look at too.
It's just shoot this stuff we had to see

548
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,040
and her fingers are still half,
half fingers are off her.

549
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,200
Yeah.
She sent me pictures.

550
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,530
She's missing fingers.
Missing tips.

551
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,700
Tips.
Yeah,

552
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,100
she's lucky.
Some of the Phalanges are gone chopped

553
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,440
up.
So they got her down.

554
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:05,890
They ended up hours and hours and hours
and we're tracking and where we're

555
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,290
trying to talk to them.
They get her down to camp four.

556
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,430
What does that track that you saw then?
The trickiest part as he'll tell you,

557
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,400
cause I can't tell you can't afford a
camp three.

558
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,220
Yeah I can't afford a cam three and then
camp three to camp two which they didn't

559
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:22,240
even do.
They couldn't get,

560
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,020
they couldn't get to camp two which is
straight on the lhotse face.

561
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,160
Lhotse face.
It's a,

562
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:31,900
it's about a 60 60 degree ice face,
which is slick.

563
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,720
So when you're roping somebody down,
you know,

564
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,940
it actually does provide,
you know,

565
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,550
less friction.
You can actually slot somebody down but

566
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,690
you can't get going too fast cause you
know,

567
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,910
so now you're at 25206207000 feet,
you're 130 pounds,

568
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,980
125 pounds shirt and you get a lower
this 200 pound lady down hard oxygen.

569
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,510
And these guys are working there and
met.

570
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:56,170
She's 200 pounds.
Well,

571
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,780
she wasn't that big,
but you know,

572
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,520
with all our gear and all that,
it was 160 170 pounds worth of weight,

573
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,990
you know,
dead weight,

574
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,750
lower down.
So we got her down,

575
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:11,410
we got her down to where we could go in
with the helicopter and we picked her up

576
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:15,040
and took her back down to base camp.
And that was when the meeting took place

577
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:18,480
between her and her husband.
The tearful rejoicing and no though.

578
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,650
So the,
the part you missed was the helicopter

579
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,270
landed it,
it couldn't land at camp two.

580
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:26,140
We weren't supposed to go up to 23,500
which at the base of low t a crampon

581
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:28,990
point,
Andrew got there and said,

582
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,440
I can only pick one of you.
And she looked at her husband and said,

583
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:37,420
you stay until he made him stay and take
the next helicopter out.

584
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,150
So we got her down and she looked at her
husband and said,

585
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,530
you stay like pitch.
You quit.

586
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,500
Well,
she was mad because he got left.

587
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,000
She was pissed off that she was pissed
that she got left,

588
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:50,780
but he couldn't have carried her.
Knowing that you're switching it

589
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,820
depends.
There's ways of looking at it both ways.

590
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,980
Somebody quit,
somebody gave up,

591
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:56,660
somebody said no.
I mean who knows?

592
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,350
But I'm sure they had to go sue through
some deep ass therapy when they got

593
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:00,981
home.
Okay.

594
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,680
So I'm gonna,
I'm going to fill in the gaps here.

595
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:08,681
So fast forward a nine or 10 months and
dude,

596
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,470
husband has a,
he has a heart attack and das.

597
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,110
So he died.
I'm sorry,

598
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:16,010
I'm not,
shouldn't be laughing.

599
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,780
That's Kinda fucked up.
It is good.

600
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,400
Fucked up man.
Come on Everest.

601
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,830
And then you fucking,
but what's the Karma though?

602
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,030
They left her.
I mean,

603
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,900
what is he going to do if he doesn't
leave her?

604
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,700
What does he do?
These sits out there with her.

605
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,560
He had told people that she's up there
and she's panicked.

606
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,380
She was panicking on the phone.
He was there.

607
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,340
Yeah.
I don't know.

608
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:38,690
I mean,
we talked about it last night,

609
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,510
the romantic story.
You huddle up with your girl and you're

610
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:42,910
going to die together.
Whoa.

611
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,031
Right?
And then,

612
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:45,260
or you get,
you go down there,

613
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:48,170
tried to get her saved and you get rid
of killed for leaving.

614
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,070
It's easy to Monday morning quarterback
any of those situations because all bets

615
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:54,710
off when you get above 26,000 feet,
I mean it's,

616
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,510
it's,
it is,

617
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:58,820
you're,
you're kind of hanging on a little bit

618
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,820
and that's why,
you know,

619
00:24:59,821 --> 00:25:03,620
you get these big into thinner stories
that happen and no one really can

620
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:06,500
remember exactly the details and,
you know,

621
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:08,630
it's,
it's a little bit sketchy.

622
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,210
Like I,
I in my intentions were,

623
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:12,710
and I did,
and you did.

624
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:16,080
And I mean,
summit notes and 26,000,

625
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,580
26,000 foot peaks.
There's always,

626
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,600
there's always variables that come into
play and it turns into theater.

627
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,750
I mean,
it's a stage who even make choices.

628
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:28,970
People make mistakes.
We had one guy on,

629
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:29,923
on,
uh,

630
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,390
what's her face again?
Grace's team.

631
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,100
He was a triathlete.
He went up,

632
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,010
broke a bunch of rules respectfully.
Oh,

633
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,930
with regards to climatization stuff.
Commonization pushed himself too much.

634
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,390
Summited,
got back down and died in his tent.

635
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,300
Oh,
his fifth attempt up there.

636
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,740
You can look it up.
It's on the end of that.

637
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,670
His fifth attempt up there pushed
himself way too hard rule.

638
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:54,620
The rules are,
if you don't make it to a certain point

639
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:56,660
by a certain time,
you should turn around and save your

640
00:25:56,661 --> 00:25:58,220
life and come back another day.

641
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,053
And he said,
no.

642
00:25:59,210 --> 00:25:59,601
He said,
no,

643
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,580
I'm pushing through.
Got to the summit too late.

644
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,860
Came back really exhausted.
16,

645
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:05,570
17 hour day,
died in the tent.

646
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,150
He was 35 years.
What did he die from?

647
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,880
Exposure.
Cerebral Edema.

648
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,590
He might've thrown a clot.
It could.

649
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:13,191
I mean,
I don't know.

650
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:15,440
I don't know the autopsy,
but I mean he,

651
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,240
you know,
it was something fairly acute,

652
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,220
you know,
it wasn't just exhaustion,

653
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,600
you know,
it wasn't just hypothermia.

654
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,960
He made it back to the tent and then
just expired in the tent.

655
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,270
So not sure.
I mean there's,

656
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,600
there's a lot of things that can go
wrong and you have a small window to get

657
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,790
it right.
What is good about it?

658
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,330
Well,
that was something big ass mountain.

659
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,213
Yeah.
Um,

660
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,210
you know,
I think that's a tough question.

661
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:40,760
It's a pretty nebulous thing.
It's very subjective.

662
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,980
It's very selfish.
There's no,

663
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,070
there's no chance.
I used

664
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:49,070
to climb pretty hard and then I had a
kid and my sense of objective risk

665
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,310
changed significantly at that point
because climbing by nature is a very

666
00:26:56,311 --> 00:27:00,690
selfish pursuit.
You're going out there to do something

667
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,190
that is bring,
it brings me joy and it brings me

668
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:10,191
fulfillment and it gives me a sense of
connection to the people that I'm

669
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:13,710
sharing a rope with.
Cause we're on a rope man.

670
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:14,760
I mean,
we're going to win together,

671
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:16,140
lose together.
I mean it's,

672
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,410
but jeff doesn't do that selfishly and
you give all these climate shit,

673
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:22,080
like that's a very selfish thing to do
for him.

674
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:24,930
But he did it because Eric did it.
Eric wanted to do it.

675
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,123
So he like,
Oh,

676
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,170
you're a selfish prick.
You summited Everest.

677
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:28,591
He goes,
no,

678
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:30,480
I've,
I've helped my blind friend go to the

679
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,950
state.
It really wasn't his goal,

680
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:35,250
his goal to help the first blind guy and
everybody on my team.

681
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,070
It wasn't just me.
I had an amazing team that was there

682
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:38,940
was,
um,

683
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,670
you know,
with all our Sherpas on summit day,

684
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,760
we were 19 of us.
And at that point,

685
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:49,170
I think this record still stands.
We're still the highest number from one

686
00:27:49,171 --> 00:27:51,510
team and one day to stand on top
together.

687
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:57,350
And I attribute that to the fact that
just as you said by like that was just a

688
00:27:57,841 --> 00:28:01,830
bunch of Bros who weren't commercially
God and we were just friends and we were

689
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:03,540
there for something that was bigger than
us.

690
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:06,240
We were there for Eric.
We wanted to get him as high up as we

691
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:08,820
could and getting back down.
And if that meant the summit,

692
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,750
awesome.
If not,

693
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,220
we'll come back and we'll still be bros
and maybe we'll go do some other cool

694
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:15,054
shit,
you know?

695
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,480
So what happens when you don't go up
there for me to plant my flag is we've

696
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:21,830
got the summit.

697
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,310
I got to stand on top.
You know,

698
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:25,230
it was pretty,
pretty cool.

699
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,930
Um,
what is the feeling like when you get to

700
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:32,931
that top and you realize that you have
summited Mount Everest well up there and

701
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:35,880
you're looking around,
you're like holy shit.

702
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,340
Top of the World Ma.
Well,

703
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,280
just like so many other times with him
and the stuff that I've done with Eric,

704
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,580
um,
I was worried about him getting down.

705
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,520
That's all I was,
I was obsessing on it because there was

706
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,590
a storm coming in and we heard all the
radio check.

707
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:55,050
How much time do you have a storm?
I mean it's,

708
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:00,070
shit is barreling.
I mean it is moving quick from the uh,

709
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,660
from Tibet across,
I mean we could see it coming and it was

710
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:05,070
probably nine,
10 in the morning.

711
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,870
And you know,
that's early.

712
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,230
And when it comes out early and monsoon,
the edge of the monsoons is late.

713
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,300
The monsoon starts to pick up in late
May.

714
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,970
You don't want to be anywhere near,
but Joe,

715
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,750
you talked about all the time the
adrenaline dump.

716
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:20,250
So imagine generals dump in a cage and
you talk about all the time now you just

717
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:22,230
summited Mount Everest,
but you're only halfway done.

718
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,940
8% of all matt mountaineering accidents
happen on the decent.

719
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,940
Wow.
He must sas.

720
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,150
That's why.
Why is that?

721
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:33,260
Because your decision making comp has
compromised and Yup.

722
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:33,900
You,
um,

723
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,120
and you,
you did what you went to do.

724
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,740
You know,
you're like,

725
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,080
Ooh,
let's fuck.

726
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,950
Can you relax your adrenaline?
You like,

727
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:43,300
I did it.
And all of a sudden they're like,

728
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,200
oh,
I get down.

729
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:46,150
That's why more technical,
to be honest with you,

730
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,360
that's somewhat of a rookie move.
Um,

731
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,080
and I,
you know,

732
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,840
experienced climbers always know to have
a little bit more in the tank.

733
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,130
You know,
it's just like a fighter,

734
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:54,730
right?
You know,

735
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,170
you've got to save some for the fifth
round,

736
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,820
right?
And you got to,

737
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,220
you got to know that it's coming and
it's gonna hurt.

738
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,800
It's gonna hurt bad.
I mean,

739
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,460
I remember my legs like I was,
they were jelly man.

740
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,020
I mean,
tried to come down from the Hillary

741
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:12,250
stuff and I was just jacked.
I was like the gumby man coming down and

742
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:15,370
I actually fell,
I fell onto a fixed drope right.

743
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,610
Right below them or right above the
hillary step.

744
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,930
Yeah.
And I got caught by a rope and it was

745
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:22,120
one of the only times I clipped in that
whole day.

746
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,200
Oh Jeez.
It was,

747
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,130
it was Kooky Shit.
Did you clip in cause you felt like your

748
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:29,110
body was getting wishy washy?
It's again,

749
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,680
I knew like a little bit not ride.
I've shot my shot,

750
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:33,770
my wad coming up.

751
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,340
I dug some ropes out with my buddy Brad
Bull,

752
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,720
uh,
for the team.

753
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,020
Um,
earlier that that morning that were

754
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:43,120
buried.
We were the first people up.

755
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,820
I mean we were the first people up and
all these reps were buried and we were

756
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:49,450
digging them out in the ice and they
were buried under a foot to two foot of

757
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:52,600
snow at 20,000 feet.
And I made Brad and I made that decision

758
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:56,410
to,
to dig those ropes out because not to

759
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:58,930
know which way to go up but to,
to make sure they were there for the

760
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:01,750
decent cause.
That's when the weather comes in.

761
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:03,670
And that's when the blind lead the blind
down.

762
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:04,081
You know,
it's,

763
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:08,800
so we dug the ropes up and I knew when I
did that,

764
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,680
um,
that I was going to be out of gas and

765
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:13,600
sure enough like coming down I knew it.

766
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,500
So that's when I was clipping it.
And that was a little bit,

767
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,480
it was a little bit more fastidious on,
you know,

768
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,050
making sure if I fell that I'd be
caught.

769
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,300
Sure enough,
wow.

770
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,670
On the rope.
And they got back on and was like good.

771
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,650
That woke me up and up and you get a
jolt.

772
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,950
Yeah.
Shake it off or look around.

773
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,591
I've got,
damn,

774
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:35,410
I wonder if everybody saw that and then
started at that.

775
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,800
Yeah.
So is it the appeal of like

776
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,470
accomplishing some of the very few
people accomplish and joining like a

777
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:43,710
very special club?
Cause I what,

778
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,200
what motivates these people?
Is it just a really difficult task and

779
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:48,460
they want to see if they have it in
them?

780
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,230
I mean,
obviously everybody's got a subjective

781
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:52,180
answer to that.
And mine is,

782
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:54,880
I liked to be with my people in the
hills.

783
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,620
That's my church.
That's where I feel the most

784
00:31:56,621 --> 00:32:00,400
comfortable.
It's where I feel safe actually in the

785
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:01,210
hills.
Right.

786
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,930
And you're around other very rugged
people.

787
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,000
Well,
just people who make good decisions,

788
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,260
you know,
and then,

789
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:08,910
you know,
the,

790
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,910
the cathedral of the big mountains makes
me happy and sort of rejuvenate my soul

791
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:16,930
and,
but there's,

792
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,980
there's something to be said for,
for seeing what my body and my mind can

793
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,430
do.
Um,

794
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,250
you know,
I think that a lot of people would,

795
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,710
would agree that that's probably one of
the,

796
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,150
the main reasons why we get out and do
these things.

797
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:32,830
But I mean,
it's no joke.

798
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:34,060
It's dangerous man.
I mean,

799
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,020
you saw one of the most accomplished
mountaineers that probably the best

800
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:39,830
mountaineer in the world just died,
you know,

801
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,410
under two months ago you will lay stack.
Yeah.

802
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,150
How did he die?
He fell.

803
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,690
He was getting ready to go do,
he's trained and up in the,

804
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,680
in the valley and that Western coon from
that camp two on Everest that you saw

805
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:52,790
that image.
Um,

806
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,170
he was going up the west shoulder of
Everest with one other Sherpa who was a

807
00:32:57,171 --> 00:33:00,290
friend of his,
not just a page Sherp it was as calming

808
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:05,060
partner and they were going to go up a
route that has yet to be successfully

809
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:07,740
seconded.
So these American second,

810
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,270
he's like,
so it's been done once people have died

811
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:12,770
trying to do it again.
Oh,

812
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:15,380
just several parties and he was going to
go do it.

813
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:18,320
It's these two Americans,
willy on unsold and Tom Hornbein did it.

814
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,280
Um,
and it hadn't been repeated cause it's,

815
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,810
it's straight up commitment.
Nam Balls like,

816
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,190
but his Sherpa was sick,
the stripper was sick.

817
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,510
So ulay uh,
was out training one one morning and I

818
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,900
think it was around four or five in the
morning.

819
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,460
Yeah.
So he was up in that sort of circ and he

820
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:39,240
was over on a mountain called
[inaudible],

821
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:43,100
which is beside everest and he fell,
who knows why,

822
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,740
maybe slipped through,
he got hit or something.

823
00:33:44,741 --> 00:33:45,920
I have to see this guy,
this guy,

824
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:48,410
you can see the videos online.
Uri Stack is this guy,

825
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:49,460
no ropes,
no nothing.

826
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,570
He's got two ice axes.
And he runs up the hill fast and you can

827
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:54,680
run on pavement.
Sure,

828
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,440
sure.
[inaudible] calling the Swiss the Swiss

829
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:59,570
machine and believes a video of him
doing this.

830
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,820
Hundreds of lots of,
how do you spell his name?

831
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:06,800
You lay.
So it's u l I deck now the incredible,

832
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:08,720
when you see it,
the incredible thing about it that you,

833
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,300
you're at the six degree pitch ice
walls.

834
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,070
He's at 26,
27 20,

835
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,050
you know,
23,000 feet and he's just gone bang,

836
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:15,441
Bang,
Bang,

837
00:34:15,441 --> 00:34:15,801
Bang,
Bang,

838
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:16,221
Bang,
Bang,

839
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:16,610
Bang.
Yeah.

840
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,540
He's in like a video game.
He's a ridiculously committed.

841
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,140
He was athlete.
I mean he's committed to his craft being

842
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:26,050
as strong as he could be,
you know,

843
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,320
technically capable.
Um,

844
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,720
but you know,
it's,

845
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,510
it's,
it's still roll the dice and how many

846
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:35,580
people died trying to do this.
I want to do Everest.

847
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,720
The second seconded one,
a good handful.

848
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:41,090
I don't know exact numbers,
but several from different

849
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:44,540
nationalities.
So everybody is either failed or died

850
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,010
except one person who's the one person
to two Americans that was willie unsold,

851
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:50,510
Tom Hornbein.
And that's what they do.

852
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,910
The ones they summit once the,
once the climbers are in it,

853
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:53,744
just,
you know,

854
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,910
humans in general,
these climbers do it.

855
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:58,580
Then they want to find a more difficult
route where they do with that oxygen.

856
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,750
So Uli was going to go up and do that.
This fucking guy is going to go do that

857
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:06,500
and then come around summit everest and
then go check that out dude.

858
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:08,700
He's like a fucking goat.
Look at this.

859
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,940
Look at that.
That's incredible.

860
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,990
So his aerobic,
you know,

861
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:14,150
he's got that ability to kick out the
lactic acid.

862
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,270
Oh my God.
That is insane.

863
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,770
I mean,
he's an absolute beast.

864
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,300
It's a shame.
It was a big loss.

865
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,340
It's just because he's been doing it for
so long.

866
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,150
Shit,
no ropes.

867
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,010
Oh my God.
Okay.

868
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:30,920
For people just listening.
What is the name of this video?

869
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:31,754
Jamie.
So,

870
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,860
uh,
Uli,

871
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:38,700
e.
E.

872
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:38,700
L.
I.

873
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:38,700
S.
T.

874
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:38,700
E.
C.

875
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,900
K.
New speed record,

876
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,860
Uyghur 2015.
So this is the north face of the eiger.

877
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,760
And so he's a Swiss dude and he grew up
sort of cut his teeth in the Alps and

878
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:50,760
just all this,
I want to be clear though,

879
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,030
this is that this isn't like the first
time he did this right.

880
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,570
It's probably the 50th time he climbed
that route and he did it over and over

881
00:35:57,571 --> 00:35:58,800
and over,
got it dialed,

882
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:01,800
figured it out,
and then went out and did these speed

883
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:02,950
records,
you know,

884
00:36:02,951 --> 00:36:06,070
and set these big writers very similar
to what just happened on El Cap.

885
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:07,570
Cathy Tan,
uh,

886
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,990
last week.
Did you hear about Alex honnold and what

887
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:11,010
Alex?
Oh yeah,

888
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,300
I did.
I watched the,

889
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,930
the pictures and video that he's been on
the podcast for.

890
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,771
Alex has,
yeah,

891
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:18,150
he's a freak.
Yeah.

892
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:20,730
So would he,
is what he did,

893
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,140
what he did,
and my,

894
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:26,580
my great way was like landing on the
moon,

895
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:27,760
dude.
I mean the,

896
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,960
the ability to pocket fear and just
focus on the three square feet in front

897
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:39,370
of you on paralleled.
Yeah.

898
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,250
I can't,
I mean I've climbed El cap and I just

899
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,210
can't imagine being up on those slats.
How long did it take you when you find

900
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,550
oh cap,
three days.

901
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,000
So three days.
So it can four hours free soloed that

902
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,820
deploy ulay people look at that and
they're like,

903
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:56,580
well it's just got super sweaty on mine
aren't mine are too by the way.

904
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,503
You know?
And I think that,

905
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,390
so if they look at you and you see this
video and you're like,

906
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:01,230
wow,
he's crazy.

907
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:04,170
He's crazy.
Now he's calculated and so is Alex.

908
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:07,260
Alex super calculate.
Like he'd climbed free rider the route

909
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:12,261
that he did a few weeks ago.
He did it several dozen times and would

910
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:15,120
fall on it,
you know,

911
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:20,121
with a rope and he just was in the right
headspace that day and went up and did

912
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,430
it without a whole lot of pomp and
circumstance.

913
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:25,880
Just went out and nailed it.
Look at this.

914
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,260
There's going to be a crazy ass video
that Jimmy Chin,

915
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,970
Jimmy was shooting it and his tea.
Yeah.

916
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,070
Jimmy was near the top with no,
what did he,

917
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,250
did he shoot it like next to him with
ropes and,

918
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,550
no.

919
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,220
So,
so Jimmy was very respectful of not

920
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:41,250
getting in his way because this is a
very obviously very intense thing.

921
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,440
Oh yeah.
And how's it going?

922
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,110
You look down there.
Fuck.

923
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:48,090
What'd you do that again?
I missed the shot.

924
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:49,830
Can you go back up?
Hey Man,

925
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:54,240
can you give me a thumbs up?
Selfie governance smile.

926
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:57,570
But Jimmy is a very accomplished climber
and he's an amazing set of a dog.

927
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,170
Jimmy Chin,
National Geographic [inaudible] top.

928
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,120
And he was at the top and him and his
team,

929
00:38:03,121 --> 00:38:06,960
I think lower down and uh,
and yeah,

930
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,320
greatest,
greatest athletic human feat.

931
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,720
I ain't going to lie.
I have to agree because it's,

932
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:18,830
if you think about true athletic feats,
it's not just obviously the,

933
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,270
you know,
the core poral sort of,

934
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,070
you know,
event.

935
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,400
It's just the whole mixed bag of who you
are as an athlete mentally,

936
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:30,510
emotionally,
behaviorally,

937
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:33,300
physically,
how you execute in the moment when shit

938
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:36,160
is just on point,
like right in your face.

939
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,490
And he did it like to this level that I
can't even,

940
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,180
it's unbelievable man ripping out of my
hands.

941
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,900
I mean these guys,
I mean once you get 30 feet off the

942
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:48,550
deck,
it's game on you man.

943
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,070
You know,
and then now put,

944
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,600
you know,
a power of a hundred on that,

945
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,630
but there's very few sports where one
mess up,

946
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:56,464
you're dead.
That's it.

947
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:01,140
Does he have any like guys that are
trying to be the next Alex honnold that

948
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:02,160
are chasing him?

949
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,910
Well,
I just read something today this morning

950
00:39:04,911 --> 00:39:08,480
about the,
there could be some emulators,

951
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,730
Eh,
who knows?

952
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:14,000
There's other super tough badass
climbers that are out there that are

953
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:16,340
also free solo on and doing shit without
ropes.

954
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:20,360
But um,
he's at another level and everyone knows

955
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:21,310
that,
you know,

956
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,570
there's this other low,
well first of all,

957
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,210
like what is,
what separates him?

958
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,150
Yeah.
Well there's a lot of body chemistry

959
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:34,180
that that is sort of a mystery.
Like how does his pituitary,

960
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,790
how does his adrenal gland not just
flame out?

961
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,260
Right.
How does he control that in a way that I

962
00:39:42,261 --> 00:39:44,020
can't write?
I mean,

963
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,630
my,
yeah,

964
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,120
we're sitting here at the desk and my
hands are sweaty just thinking about it.

965
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:49,730
Right?
So there he is as calm and collected as

966
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:51,740
he can be.
They've done studies on,

967
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,540
on Alex,
they brought him in and like,

968
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,850
you know,
buzzed his brains like where are you,

969
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,960
you know,
chemically,

970
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:02,470
biochemically when we introduce,
introduce assaulting sort of variables

971
00:40:02,511 --> 00:40:07,511
on you and he's just flatlined.
So he's the perfect blend of

972
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:12,950
biochemistry and physical capacity but
also devotion and commitment to his

973
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:15,200
craft.
I mean,

974
00:40:15,201 --> 00:40:16,130
he's an artist,
right?

975
00:40:16,131 --> 00:40:16,940
That's so,
and he,

976
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,920
he got down from that,
from that climb that day,

977
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:20,630
just a couple of weeks ago.
And they were like,

978
00:40:20,631 --> 00:40:21,980
what are you going to go do now?
You know,

979
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:24,110
this isn't a Disneyland.
He was going on his fingerboard and he

980
00:40:24,111 --> 00:40:26,120
was going to go train and do like,
you know,

981
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:31,150
fingerboard workout that afternoon
because climbing El cap for four hours

982
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,550
was not enough workout for the day.
And it was like

983
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,760
whatever.
He says what?

984
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:39,980
I'm in an MRI and showed them images and
this,

985
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,200
that's what was his response was it
brain is brains fear levels.

986
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,360
After looking at gruesome and a rousing
images,

987
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,360
he commented,
it was like whatever that is.

988
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:51,190
That dude,
he's so mellow.

989
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,053
Right.
But that's what,

990
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,010
how he described it.
When I said to him,

991
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,450
I said like,
what is it like?

992
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,160
Are you freaking out?
He's trying to keep calm.

993
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:59,230
It's like you're really mellow.
He goes,

994
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,150
if,
if anything is like,

995
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:03,160
if you,
if there's anything wrong,

996
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,340
it's so wrong.
Like when it goes wrong,

997
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,760
like you're fucked.
Like so you're always,

998
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,460
he's his way of putting it was mellow.

999
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,570
Yeah.
You're really mellow video I believe,

1000
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:16,490
and it may be Alex and maybe some
another other climate,

1001
00:41:16,491 --> 00:41:20,030
but thinks is a video of him probably
they'll cap when he was three solon

1002
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,220
before this one where he says gimme a
minute.

1003
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,150
It was northwest direct face of half
dome and I've climbed that route too.

1004
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,340
And I'll tell you I,
the only time I've ever seen him flat,

1005
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:31,420
that was the,
that was the iconic image on Nat Geo on

1006
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,540
National Geographic magazine of him.
Just in his plaid shorts shirt,

1007
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,190
like on the ledge,
you know,

1008
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:39,020
leaning back.
And it was,

1009
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,270
he reflected on that.
They asked him about it later and they

1010
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:42,740
said,
you know what was going on?

1011
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:44,060
He says,
I just needed a minute.

1012
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,790
And he got it and he calmed himself
down.

1013
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,650
Whatever was happening in his head,
who knows?

1014
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:51,750
And he recalibrated and went up,
you know,

1015
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,430
no gear.

1016
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,200
So it's just,
who knows?

1017
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:55,820
There's,
there's a right there.

1018
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:57,240
That's when he needed a minute.
No,

1019
00:41:57,241 --> 00:41:57,760
no,
no.

1020
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,870
There's a,
there's another one of Jamie.

1021
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:00,621
It's it,
it's,

1022
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:01,700
it's,
he's in that green.

1023
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,980
There he is over there on the right.
Yeah.

1024
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,410
That one.
And the green or the gre or the right

1025
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:08,380
above it right there.
It's uh,

1026
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,280
the one where you stand in there.
I was sort of on the left.

1027
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:10,920
Yeah,
that's,

1028
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,150
that's the one that I think was the nat
Geo and that's the one he says,

1029
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,190
I just need a minute.
Just need a minute.

1030
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,160
That's um,
that's a thousand feet off that debt.

1031
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,193
Hmm.

1032
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,860
Yeah.
I mean,

1033
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,690
imagine if that's your kid.
We all,

1034
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:26,951
you know,
and you're like,

1035
00:42:26,951 --> 00:42:30,730
what are you doing today honey?
So apparently he has a very,

1036
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:34,220
very close relationship with his momma.
He grew up in Sacramento I guess.

1037
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,280
And I'm guessing he just tells his momma
what she needs to know until after it's

1038
00:42:39,511 --> 00:42:40,570
over.
Yeah.

1039
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,760
Fucking Christ.
It's just like that is a,

1040
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,350
that's a crazy thing to be awesome at,
you know?

1041
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,370
All right.
All right,

1042
00:42:48,371 --> 00:42:48,730
hold on.
Wait.

1043
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,100
So we're talking a lot about Columbia,
but there other reason why I want to

1044
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,110
bring Jeff here.
We're not changing subjects.

1045
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,450
I don't know where the fuck you think
you're going.

1046
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,640
This,
this guy like,

1047
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,930
so you said that there are a few people
that are trying to emulate what he's

1048
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:03,190
doing.
Well,

1049
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,490
I think there's just a few guys doing
their own thing and it happens to be

1050
00:43:06,491 --> 00:43:09,250
free soloing and you know,
he's,

1051
00:43:09,251 --> 00:43:12,100
he's the pioneer and there were other
guys before him.

1052
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,220
There was a guy named Peter Croft.
It was out there for many years,

1053
00:43:15,221 --> 00:43:15,791
sort of,
you know,

1054
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:18,730
he did a,
he did a route called astro man in the

1055
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:20,560
valley.
That was at the time.

1056
00:43:20,561 --> 00:43:23,710
And I remember I was in my,
I think my early twenties when,

1057
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:27,160
when Peter did that.
And I remember reading about it and

1058
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:28,960
thinking,
no,

1059
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,910
like what,
how,

1060
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,750
how does one want to,
and I was just really getting into

1061
00:43:34,751 --> 00:43:37,120
climbing a lot and I just couldn't,
it didn't compute.

1062
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:42,540
But Peter Croft I think and guys like
him and like Alex just have a wiring

1063
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,430
that's very,
very different than the rest of us.

1064
00:43:45,431 --> 00:43:48,100
And it seems reckless to many,
many people.

1065
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,320
But what I do seems reckless to many
people.

1066
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:53,050
So it's so relative and there's a scale,
you know,

1067
00:43:53,051 --> 00:43:55,300
and,
and people that would look at Alex and

1068
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:56,410
be like,
you're crazy man,

1069
00:43:56,411 --> 00:43:57,250
that shit,
you're going to get to it.

1070
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,690
And like he's like whatever man.
I'm sure.

1071
00:43:58,691 --> 00:43:59,810
Yeah,
there is a scale.

1072
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:01,690
There's a scale.
Yeah.

1073
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:06,400
Well what about physically?
Like is there like an optimum building?

1074
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,530
Like for basketball you really want to
be tall and thin,

1075
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,520
right?
Is there,

1076
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,160
is there an optimum billed for what he
does?

1077
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:12,910
I mean,
I think,

1078
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:17,060
you know sinewy and,
and the strength to weight ratio is,

1079
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,090
is obviously,
you know,

1080
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,290
the best climbers are usually thin,
pretty thin and you know,

1081
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:25,030
every themselves well and you know,
it's,

1082
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,950
it's,
he's got big hands,

1083
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,950
like not necessarily big like basketball
player,

1084
00:44:29,951 --> 00:44:34,860
but like his fingers sausages is these
fat fingers from constantly training

1085
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:36,810
them and almost calloused.
Yeah.

1086
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,630
Well the,
just the amount of weight that he can

1087
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,910
carry on his hands,
he's gotta be pretty unusual.

1088
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,531
Yeah.
This,

1089
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:46,620
so this finger thing that he does,
like what is the thing that he did?

1090
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,710
The campus board or a finger or one of
those peg boards,

1091
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:51,870
like for wrestling,
that's kind of like a campus board is

1092
00:44:51,871 --> 00:44:55,560
like an inverted sorta board that you
climb up just for strength and it works

1093
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:58,290
your core and your arms and your chest
and your delts and stuff.

1094
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:01,110
But then,
then the fingerboard allows you to get,

1095
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,150
you know,
Mano Doit doubled Deloitte,

1096
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,990
you know,
two finger strength so he can then slot

1097
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:10,770
and then pull on one of those.
So strengthens all your tendons in your,

1098
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,990
in your hands and your fingers.
Particularly.

1099
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,990
I'm just a little holes carved out of,
uh,

1100
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,970
sometimes it's uh,
it's a,

1101
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,200
that's her right there.
Yeah.

1102
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,470
So sometimes it's more,
sometimes it's a composite.

1103
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,330
It's like almost like a little cubby
shelf.

1104
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,970
And so you stick your hands in there.
Yeah.

1105
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,090
And then there's routines.
I used these two finger pockets and

1106
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:30,924
three finger puck.

1107
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,410
Oh Wow.
You use one too?

1108
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,450
And I do,
yeah.

1109
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,171
Wow.
He's one,

1110
00:45:34,171 --> 00:45:35,640
two.
And then I'll try and hang,

1111
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,140
you know,
and then count the 30,

1112
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:42,210
hang and then go to finger and hang.
And he did this after he summited.

1113
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,970
So we went down and was like,
got to interview and he goes,

1114
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:47,220
sorry man,
I've got to go do a workout now.

1115
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,260
How's that?
Tired?

1116
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,200
Well that's fine.
That's why he's the best,

1117
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:53,250
right.
I where he is.

1118
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:54,913
Wow.
Workable.

1119
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,610
So did this exist 20 years ago?
Was there a lot of people free soloing

1120
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:01,110
20 years ago and I'm,
he's like,

1121
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:03,330
that's the Peter Croft,
you know those guys.

1122
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:04,410
There was a few.
And,

1123
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,050
um,
back in the old camp for Yosemite days,

1124
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:08,340
I can Yosemite valley,
I mean it's,

1125
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,220
this was the place,
this was the birth of it.

1126
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,530
And then there was some dudes that were
not far from here.

1127
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,570
Um,
and Joshua tree that we're doing some

1128
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:19,650
pretty balls out solo and Joshua tree.
Yeah.

1129
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,780
In j tree.
Um,

1130
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:23,970
and I lived in Joshua tree for a while
just living in my van down by the river

1131
00:46:23,971 --> 00:46:28,950
there and climbing all the time and
eating ramen noodles and growing my head

1132
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:30,840
a little bit.
You know what I'm saying?

1133
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,590
Um,
and in the tree man,

1134
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:34,530
and,
and cause you know,

1135
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:36,180
there's a lot of climb in there.
That's,

1136
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,070
that's uh,
it's pretty,

1137
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:41,040
there's high ball stuff.
Know if you could look at like the

1138
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:43,920
amount of mushrooms that are done,
like in a specific location.

1139
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:46,410
And then look at Josh,
which be like the high concentration.

1140
00:46:46,411 --> 00:46:49,200
I saw so many people go to Joshua tree,
just,

1141
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:50,070
just,
just throw him out.

1142
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:50,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

1143
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,740
I mean,
I'd like to look at that map.

1144
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,110
There'd be a big target.
Yeah,

1145
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,730
seriously.

1146
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:56,880
Probably a big cluster,
right?

1147
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:57,810
Yeah.
I mean I've,

1148
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,760
I've,
I've seen some good stuff there,

1149
00:46:59,761 --> 00:47:00,331
man.
I mean,

1150
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:03,770
that was when I was sort of really,
really diving in.

1151
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:07,620
I was diving into climbing those things.
Those two things were conjoined was

1152
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,650
psychotropics and in a way,
and climbing,

1153
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,750
they are the,
with a lot of folks.

1154
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:15,450
Well,
it's that extreme connection to nature,

1155
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:17,130
right.
And to life.

1156
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:19,380
And like you were talking about it a
little bit ago before we came on air.

1157
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:20,214
It was,
you know,

1158
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,120
when,
you know,

1159
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:23,910
when you're stoned,
you see the ball track better when

1160
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:25,350
you're playing pool.
Oh yeah.

1161
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,180
Right.
You feel like the revolutions of the

1162
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:29,140
ball,
like you feel like how well you could

1163
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,070
touch the ball

1164
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,650
and get it to move.
Like you're too bulky for me at least.

1165
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:33,620
Yeah.
You know,

1166
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,710
I feel I play like 10% better when I'm
high.

1167
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,330
Yeah.
For whatever reason.

1168
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,730
Just feel more in touch with things.
Yeah.

1169
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,940
That's why I like the social sliver.
Social Sliver.

1170
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:43,970
Ooh,
what's that mean?

1171
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,660
Liver microdose.
Oh,

1172
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,900
micro of,
of mushrooms or acid.

1173
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:51,300
Mushrooms.
But I'm,

1174
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:54,520
yeah,
so the new medium for us,

1175
00:47:54,521 --> 00:47:55,690
I don't know if if,
um,

1176
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,550
if you've,
if you've heard of it,

1177
00:47:57,551 --> 00:47:58,390
is,
is Goo,

1178
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,250
do you know the Goo Goo?
Nah.

1179
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:05,210
So it's super concentrated.
Siliciden so they take mushrooms and

1180
00:48:05,211 --> 00:48:06,340
they,
um,

1181
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,470
distill it down,
concentrated up,

1182
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:12,820
get this liquid turnitin in and do a
tootsie roll appearing,

1183
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:17,020
uh,
consistency color.

1184
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,120
Give it an a halloween,
get a stick.

1185
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:21,550
Yeah.
And you get a stick and it's literally

1186
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:23,740
the size of a tootsie roll.
And we just took like a little,

1187
00:48:23,741 --> 00:48:27,300
just a little nip and that's the social
sliver and like,

1188
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,200
ah,
and then it makes you just a little more

1189
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:29,810
tuned in.

1190
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,240
I mean,
a lot more tuned in.

1191
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:34,000
I have a buddy who's a high level
kickboxer world champion.

1192
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:36,640
Kickboxer started microdosing few months
back,

1193
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:39,630
does it hoover every day,
micro doses.

1194
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:43,120
And he competes on it fucks people up.
Always.

1195
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,240
Microdosing so with what?
With el or with now mushrooms.

1196
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,800
So the,
I think,

1197
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:50,290
and you might know more than in the zone
to me,

1198
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:52,150
but if you,
if you take it seriously,

1199
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:53,140
it starts,
you lose,

1200
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,060
it gets diluted over time.
Yeah.

1201
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:56,800
But when he takes,
when he stops taking it,

1202
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,720
he feels that he misses it does,
yeah.

1203
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,030
Every day.
Like a vitamin.

1204
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,920
Yup.
I think that's called addiction.

1205
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,760
I don't think so because not addicted.
Addictive.

1206
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,660
But it's like you get addicted to
washing your hands.

1207
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,300
If you're one crazy ocd guy,
I gotta wash your hands one more time.

1208
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:12,610
Like if you really,
you can get a mental pathway that's very

1209
00:49:12,611 --> 00:49:13,930
destructive,
you know,

1210
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:17,080
you can call it addictive but it doesn't
demonize washing your hands.

1211
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,690
And you know,
I think his issue is uh,

1212
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,700
um,
when he doesn't take it,

1213
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:23,750
he says it just,
things aren't as fun.

1214
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:26,650
It doesn't feel as good.
But I've been around him when he's

1215
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:28,780
taking it and he's 100%,
they're like,

1216
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:29,681
it's not,
it's not.

1217
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:30,790
He's like,
wow man,

1218
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,910
I could like see your eyes and I'm
thinking you're eyes are looking at me

1219
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,060
and what is your eyes seeing?
I assume they're seeing with homes now.

1220
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:40,330
He's there,
there like you're there but broad needs

1221
00:49:40,331 --> 00:49:43,510
a little experience and it's like you
agree really like calling over here

1222
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:45,730
cause I have no idea what the fuck you
guys are talking about him with the

1223
00:49:45,731 --> 00:49:47,800
social sliver before.
Just to see what happened.

1224
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:51,210
Good farm go either way with him though
should hotbox and right now that's fuck

1225
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,090
him up.
No,

1226
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,230
no.
He's scared.

1227
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,550
He's going to do pee test.

1228
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,040
Interesting.
D Pts,

1229
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:59,300
he owns his own company.
That's a fight to say because to me

1230
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,110
testing themselves.
Joe's been trying to get me,

1231
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,720
he just likes to visit and those are
trying to be high for about 18 years.

1232
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,520
I have exaggerated,
I had the microdosing the Goo man.

1233
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,350
It is,
it is.

1234
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:12,760
Well,
let's talk later about,

1235
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:15,430
I know there's people,
there's,

1236
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,920
there's conversations that need to have
to happen.

1237
00:50:17,921 --> 00:50:20,860
The absolutely.
So are a lot of these climbers doing

1238
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:21,694
that?
I don't.

1239
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,310
I don't think so.
I think,

1240
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,790
you know,
I think that,

1241
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,020
uh,
you know,

1242
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:28,370
there's,
there's probably a handful of us that

1243
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:30,770
like to mess around with those things
all together.

1244
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:33,070
And not to say that I don't like to,
you know,

1245
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:36,650
trip my balls off and go get on a rock.
Of course right now,

1246
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:39,800
in fact,
I've had a few sort of spooky times just

1247
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:44,450
being really stoned and being on a rock
and not liking the situation I was in.

1248
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,680
Yeah.
Yeah,

1249
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,830
I've been that way.
Just normal life.

1250
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,350
Like you get too stoned,
especially like edibles.

1251
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,130
Chiba chew fuck me.
Oh,

1252
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,430
they'll fuck you up.
Uh Oh fuck you.

1253
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:57,710
I had a bit off my last special.
That's based on the truth.

1254
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:02,750
I hate a fucking gummy bear,
a pot gummy bear and a this the guy told

1255
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:05,240
me to just eat the leg.
It really is a true thing.

1256
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:06,770
I'm like,
why the fuck are you making a whole

1257
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:08,530
bear?
Then if he wants him to eat a leg,

1258
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,800
it's this tiny little thing and I hate
the whole bear and oh my God.

1259
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,750
For the fridge for a while too.
It's long time till it's metabolized

1260
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:17,420
rights,
hours,

1261
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,940
hours.
But you feel so good when it's over.

1262
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:23,360
You feel like I needed that.
I needed all that pain and fear and just

1263
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:25,940
say I got through it and it's like a
near death experience,

1264
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,840
you know like something,
something about it like it's cleansing.

1265
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,980
Eating a gummy bear should have that
kind of a shouldn't but it does and when

1266
00:51:33,981 --> 00:51:37,550
it comes through on the other side like
it's beneficial as long as you could

1267
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:40,010
keep it together,
you know as a person who's,

1268
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:43,670
that's why bums me out that you don't
smoke pot or do anything cause I know

1269
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:45,950
you could keep it together because
you're a tough guy.

1270
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:47,930
You keep life together.
Like you would just,

1271
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,720
it would just make you more aware of but
here's my,

1272
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,290
here's my teen.
Years ago we started this company to

1273
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,940
take on you.
Bud is a on the death bed.

1274
00:51:55,941 --> 00:51:58,940
I'm going to get them.
Hi Bud likes to be in control.

1275
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,990
Yeah,
that's the problem.

1276
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,840
And he's afraid that he might not be.
You ever look at the closet?

1277
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,190
I did.
Does it shock you when everything's

1278
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:07,470
black?
It's a little confusing.

1279
00:52:07,471 --> 00:52:10,700
So I had a 10 minute conversation with
this dude last night.

1280
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,990
Like dude,
that kind of fucked me up.

1281
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:14,550
Looking at your closet
there.

1282
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,460
The fuck out of my sight.
I don't like other colors.

1283
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:21,140
Everything's black.
It was linear feet of of one shade.

1284
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:23,240
Variation of the other black shirt of
the other books.

1285
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,300
He's a fucking Ninja.
No play makes jack a dull boy.

1286
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:28,310
All work and no play.
Makes Jack a dull boy.

1287
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:29,780
Oh yeah.
No,

1288
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:30,614
no,
no.

1289
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,930
It's efficient decision making.
Right?

1290
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:36,020
I don't have to make that decision.
The other shit that goes on the left so

1291
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:39,740
I'm going to wear that.
I feel that I could feel that.

1292
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,050
I get it.
I understand that guys guys,

1293
00:52:42,051 --> 00:52:44,150
everybody develops a uniform in life.
Right?

1294
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,980
When you,
it doesn't matter if it's a khaki shorts

1295
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:49,970
and a blue everybody,
as long as you develop it.

1296
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:53,630
It's interesting though,
if it was orange it would be a big

1297
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,550
issue.
If you are walking around with orange

1298
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:57,650
sneakers and orange pants and orange
shirt,

1299
00:52:57,651 --> 00:53:00,230
like this wacky motherfucker,
but somehow or another because it's

1300
00:53:00,231 --> 00:53:02,210
black and like,
oh it's bud friend of mine,

1301
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:05,420
Tom Dupont is a head of the,
he owns the Dupont Registry magazine,

1302
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,750
green pants,
like shitty looking green pants all the

1303
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:09,171
time.
Like,

1304
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:10,520
what's with a shitty green?

1305
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:15,780
Okay.
Whatever the fuck I was,

1306
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:17,930
we had vetted chemicals.
Fuck off

1307
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,750
his reality.
It's probably so confusing.

1308
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,720
Everybody remembers me.
My green pants.

1309
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:29,070
I was in Lynn,
I recently,

1310
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:32,960
and Larry Ellison owns the whole,
the whole look and island.

1311
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:36,140
He owns the whole,
I bought it and built it well,

1312
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,040
was a dole.
Pineapple owned it.

1313
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,440
First of all,
don't pineapple bought it off of,

1314
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:42,450
I was there.
I read the history of the islands.

1315
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:44,880
Amazing.
A Mormon owned it,

1316
00:53:44,881 --> 00:53:47,100
some crazy,
but they don't even think it was really

1317
00:53:47,101 --> 00:53:49,170
a mormon.
They think it was just a con man who

1318
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:52,770
used being a mormon to lock people up.
Fuck wives.

1319
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,410
Yeah.
There's this probably a lot of stories

1320
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,960
just like that.
Oh yeah.

1321
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:58,410
Oh yeah.
There's quite a few.

1322
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,510
Especially with Mormons,
that's very,

1323
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:02,070
very interesting religion.
Right?

1324
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,080
When you know the guy who made the
religion,

1325
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,360
like there's two religions like that are
pretty prominent.

1326
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,240
L Ron Hubbard of course,
and then Joseph Smith.

1327
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,690
Mormons,
you know the guy kind of a comment.

1328
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:11,990
Yeah.
Oh,

1329
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:16,990
100% I got to jail was 14 and found a
golden tablets.

1330
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:20,160
They contain the loss work of Jesus and
only he could read them cause he had a

1331
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:24,090
magic seer stone had a stone that he
could look through is to read these

1332
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,870
fucking Christ broke out of jail.
He jumped out of the window and was

1333
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:28,441
murdered.
Yeah.

1334
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:29,620
Got Murdered in jail.
You know,

1335
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,420
he got killed in jail.
I think what the,

1336
00:54:31,421 --> 00:54:32,940
the funny thing is,
I think it didn't,

1337
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,130
if it was him or somebody else who
invented the polygamy part,

1338
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:35,910
they're like,
wait a minute,

1339
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:38,910
I got another tablet.
I can fuck all the bitches I want.

1340
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:41,400
Hold on.
Every guy that was many wives I want.

1341
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:42,980
Yeah,
it's uh,

1342
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,610
yeah.
Good luck with all that.

1343
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,533
That never works.

1344
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:46,560
But the,
um,

1345
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,100
why would you want more than one?
I know I can't handle one.

1346
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:53,340
Some people just like danger,
like Alex honnold likes to solo climb,

1347
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:57,270
you know,
I mean it's just people like chicks

1348
00:54:57,271 --> 00:54:58,890
yelling at them.
I don't know,

1349
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,180
whatever.
It sounds like it,

1350
00:55:00,181 --> 00:55:02,910
I'm not here to judge overload.
I think it should be legal.

1351
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,770
I think if those 19 women are into it
and you're into it,

1352
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,630
why,
why is it even legal to get married at

1353
00:55:06,631 --> 00:55:09,630
all?
Why is it when you see 50% divorce and

1354
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:11,430
people get their,
their lives devastated,

1355
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:12,960
when does the government step in and go,
hey,

1356
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,950
you gotta stop doing this.
This is just ruining all these people.

1357
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,530
Like the kids,
it ruins more people than ne thing.

1358
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:22,340
It just stop getting married.
Keeps the loggers afloat.

1359
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,520
Yeah.
It does.

1360
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,290
That is it just stop the fucking lawyer.

1361
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:27,420
Yeah.
It's a big business and weddings and

1362
00:55:27,421 --> 00:55:30,240
lawyers can,
we can't stop that won't make any money.

1363
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:31,450
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

1364
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,120
Fuck all that.
But um,

1365
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:38,180
so this guy who's this crazy mormon guy,
sold it to the Dole company who used to

1366
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:42,330
run pineapples there.
They used to have just massive pineapple

1367
00:55:42,331 --> 00:55:45,210
plantation and that was what it was
forever.

1368
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,720
And then,
um,

1369
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:51,330
some other dude murdoch,
but not Rupert Murdoch and another half

1370
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:52,410
of Westlake.
Yeah.

1371
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:55,290
Almost all of it.
That dude bought it and then he sold it

1372
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:59,640
to Larry Ellison who just runs around
and gold underwear and fucking ass

1373
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:01,910
people carry him like he's an emperor
kind of curse,

1374
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:04,740
making that up.
Colonel Kurtz on and I don't even know

1375
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:06,420
where he is.
He keeps it plays out there,

1376
00:56:06,421 --> 00:56:08,250
I guess,
but he just wanted to own it.

1377
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,110
It's a fucking baller place to live
though.

1378
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,930
So there's not,
how many people live there?

1379
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,960
3000 there's 15,000 access dear though.
Oh yeah.

1380
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:21,930
So am I right in remembering that the,
the concentration of people,

1381
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:24,580
it's not necessarily on a coastline
nights in the middle,

1382
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:25,770
right?
It's in the middle.

1383
00:56:25,771 --> 00:56:27,000
Yeah.
Smart people don't live on the coast.

1384
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,600
[inaudible] smart.
They're like,

1385
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:30,580
I'm,
this island's not that big.

1386
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:32,870
And sometimes shit goes bad.
Well,

1387
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,100
it's not pr where the water has got,
we could go to the fucking water.

1388
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,370
It's right there.
It's the asshole American like,

1389
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:39,670
Oh,
I want to live there.

1390
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,950
Anywhere you are,
you can take a hike to the water.

1391
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,260
It'll take a few hours if you're in the
middle,

1392
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,870
but get there like you don't have to
live there.

1393
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,720
Jesus Christ.
So tell me about the access to,

1394
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,520
I want to hear it.
They're everywhere.

1395
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,240
Not even sporting or,
oh,

1396
00:56:53,241 --> 00:56:54,910
it was definitely sporting.
Cause these animals,

1397
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,920
they evolve to run from tigers.
They are the fastest fucking animals I

1398
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:01,390
have ever seen in my life.

1399
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,760
Like in terms of like their ability to
react.

1400
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,490
Like there would be a deer 60 yards
away.

1401
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:10,750
You draw back on it and launched the
Arrow and it would be nowhere near that

1402
00:57:10,751 --> 00:57:13,750
Arrow by the time the Arrow got.
So you lost a few sharp sticks while

1403
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:16,240
you're there while you go five lighted
nocks.

1404
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:17,590
I can see them in the,
in the grass,

1405
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:22,591
but I lost two.
But the arrows are going 275 feet a

1406
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,640
second.
And the deers like

1407
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,480
chance to the island because there's no,
there's no indigenous mammos on that

1408
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:35,440
island.
Everything is invasive and everything

1409
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:39,160
has no predators.
So they bring in these rangers and seals

1410
00:57:39,161 --> 00:57:40,950
the snipers.
They bring them in,

1411
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,900
they set up on a bench and they just
start pumping.

1412
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,100
But Bang,
they started taking them out and they

1413
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,380
have decal.
Yeah,

1414
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:49,060
well no they don't have to use a 50 cow.

1415
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,250
We'd probably use like [inaudible] or
something.

1416
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:54,250
But why do that when you want the meat,
the meat is outstanding.

1417
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,320
It is some of the most delicious meat in
the world.

1418
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,970
But these animals are so on point.
So for bow hunters it was like one of

1419
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:05,440
the best places for spot and stalk.
Like if you could put the smack down on

1420
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:08,530
an axis deer,
like you either got lucky,

1421
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,640
which is me or you got some skill,
you know,

1422
00:58:11,641 --> 00:58:15,040
like I've got a little bit of skill but
the guys that I went with it are really

1423
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:16,060
good.
Like Remy Warren,

1424
00:58:16,061 --> 00:58:17,980
I think he shot three or four while I
was there.

1425
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:21,190
My friend John Dudley shot for
worldclass bow hunters.

1426
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:24,460
Like as good as it gets.
Those guys killed quite a few.

1427
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:25,580
But it is,
you got,

1428
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,560
it's a great learning ground like for
stalking cause you,

1429
00:58:29,561 --> 00:58:31,890
you blow so many stocks getting it.

1430
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,750
How long do you smell you?
Um,

1431
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:38,210
I only hunted for three days because a,
I had a problem with my bow that I had a

1432
00:58:38,211 --> 00:58:40,600
fixed once I got there.
And it took a day to do that.

1433
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:44,200
But once you get there and you see how
many deer,

1434
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:45,790
you realize like,
oh,

1435
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:48,160
okay,
this is like this place is overpopulate

1436
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:50,140
so,
but in those three days,

1437
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,460
all right,
I saw thousands.

1438
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:52,930
You saw shit.
Thousands,

1439
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,970
I mean thousands and you took a few
shots.

1440
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:56,680
Yes,
I took a free shots.

1441
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,050
Yeah,
they're tough animals too.

1442
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,580
So are you moving?
Are you literally,

1443
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:03,010
are you moving in stock and then pause
it and holding?

1444
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,660
Yeah,
you're doing what you call steel

1445
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,550
hunting,
walking.

1446
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:08,430
And then you're looking for an animal
that you're,

1447
00:59:08,431 --> 00:59:10,030
you're constantly using your wind
checker,

1448
00:59:10,031 --> 00:59:13,920
which is like a wising bottle with the
talcum shower.

1449
00:59:13,921 --> 00:59:16,390
And you bought $100 a while just
recently started.

1450
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:19,570
So you puff that in the air and you find
out which way the wind is going.

1451
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:23,270
My guide though,
he knew where the wind was going.

1452
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,940
He just knew from his face and his neck
and his skin.

1453
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:28,070
Like he can tell,
of course the wind blowing and he's

1454
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:29,360
like,
like this.

1455
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:32,450
And he just puffed that smoke in there
and sure enough it was going exactly

1456
00:59:32,451 --> 00:59:34,520
where it was.
Shout out to roll man.

1457
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:36,890
But his,
uh,

1458
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:40,130
his ability to sneak up on these animals
is pretty fucking impressive to,

1459
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,900
you know,
I do a lot of crawling,

1460
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:43,940
like a lot of the grasses like waist
high,

1461
00:59:43,941 --> 00:59:47,510
so you're doing like crawling where
you're moving like literally like a

1462
00:59:47,511 --> 00:59:50,690
snail's pace.
Try not to make too much noise cause you

1463
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:53,030
know,
they're over there and I'm already

1464
00:59:53,031 --> 00:59:56,930
reading glass and you're on an island so
they can't really go that far.

1465
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:58,970
They're fine.
There's plenty of room for them to go.

1466
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:01,610
There's a,
I mean this is not like you're hunting

1467
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:04,610
them in a 100 acre confined high fence
place.

1468
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:08,690
It's all wild and free range and it's,
there's mountain terrain and there's

1469
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:10,240
plenty of places for them to get away
from,

1470
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:13,010
but they're aware of one Predator
humans,

1471
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:14,840
you know,
so now that they're not scared of

1472
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,150
anything other than people when they see
a person like,

1473
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:19,910
fuck this,
but are there a lot of bow hunters that

1474
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:21,950
go over there?
There's plenty of bowhunters ago over

1475
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:22,784
there.
Yeah,

1476
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:23,720
it is.
Um,

1477
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,700
it's,
it's a pretty amazing place,

1478
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:27,590
man.
But Maui is another really great place

1479
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:28,670
for bow hunting too,
apparently.

1480
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:32,240
And Molly also has pigs.
Maui has a axis deer.

1481
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,700
They have a deer,
a ram called a move.

1482
01:00:34,701 --> 01:00:37,400
Flon that apparently is unbelievably
delicious,

1483
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:38,930
but the locals think it tastes like
shit.

1484
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:42,590
Some local set of tastes like shit and
some local sets the most delicious meat

1485
01:00:42,591 --> 01:00:44,330
ever.
But the bow hunters that I was there

1486
01:00:44,331 --> 01:00:46,540
with,
there's a move flon the bow hunters.

1487
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:49,370
I was there with,
see if it's sunny on remy Warren's page.

1488
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:53,990
Remy warrants instagram I think has
cause he shot one beautiful ones.

1489
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,700
That acts is better than venison.
It's not better nail.

1490
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,170
It is delicious.
It is delicious.

1491
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:02,630
I wouldn't say it's better than elk.
Elk is my favorite meat,

1492
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,570
but it's right there.
It's right there.

1493
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:06,680
It's really good.
Yeah.

1494
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,100
Yeah.
Cause you know,

1495
01:01:08,101 --> 01:01:09,980
like an analog ended.
I'm not trying to relate those with

1496
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:11,690
Angela.
There's remy super say,

1497
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:14,180
Gee,
this is a one that he shot in the nice,

1498
01:01:14,181 --> 01:01:15,860
it's a really small animal.
Right.

1499
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:17,000
And,
um,

1500
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,590
they are,
you know,

1501
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,260
they're on this really rugged mountain
terrain.

1502
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:24,920
Lanai is so fascinating.
It's such a fascinating place.

1503
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,560
And the people that live there could not
be nicer,

1504
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:29,720
could not be cooler.
It's beautiful.

1505
01:01:29,721 --> 01:01:31,520
Gorgeous Paradise.
Yeah.

1506
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,780
But um,
yeah it's weird because they've decided

1507
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:37,640
to introduce these animals.
I think they did it.

1508
01:01:37,641 --> 01:01:40,610
Wait,
wait back hundreds of years ago and they

1509
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,880
have to keep those populations in check
and sometimes again they bring in

1510
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:48,440
snipers and they put a bench down and
they just set up shop and get those long

1511
01:01:48,441 --> 01:01:49,890
range skills.
Go on Papaya.

1512
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:51,590
So I was,
I was on Maui,

1513
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,030
um,
probably about,

1514
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:56,210
I guess a month ago now.
And I went over to my buddy's house and

1515
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:58,940
he has a pretty sweet spread.
It's at the top of this canyon and

1516
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:03,140
looking down upon the,
up on the hill going towards Holly

1517
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:05,150
Aquila and um,
he's like,

1518
01:02:05,151 --> 01:02:08,690
man,
you can come on my property anytime and

1519
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,460
shoot these fucking deer.
Wow.

1520
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:12,170
Cause they come cause he's like,
they're just,

1521
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,360
they're a pain in the ass.
They're everywhere.

1522
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,280
We need to get rid of them.
They come in and eat.

1523
01:02:16,281 --> 01:02:18,590
My orange is and this and that.
So,

1524
01:02:18,591 --> 01:02:20,100
but what's the tax situation

1525
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,791
like?
Do you have to,

1526
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:21,480
I mean,

1527
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,690
is it part of the blame license?
You get a license.

1528
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,850
This public land,
we hunted public land and 100 private

1529
01:02:26,851 --> 01:02:29,370
land,
but you get a license and then you shoot

1530
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,260
as many as you want.
No limit.

1531
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:33,030
No limit.
Didn't want to.

1532
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,800
They mean to have a pride them.
Yeah.

1533
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:37,140
I mean it's not a problem.
It's not like they're not sick.

1534
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,180
There's not,
there's plenty of food for these dear.

1535
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,680
Yeah.
That's why we're not getting chronic

1536
01:02:40,681 --> 01:02:41,201
wasting.
No,

1537
01:02:41,201 --> 01:02:41,400
no,
no.

1538
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,380
It's beautiful.
Lush and green.

1539
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:46,260
But they're just everywhere.
They're everywhere,

1540
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:48,420
but they're not easy.
You know?

1541
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:50,130
If you had a rifle,
it's pretty sure,

1542
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,070
but it's a pay and pack and get them
back to the states.

1543
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:54,870
Did you go over there?
You want to shoot 10 of them?

1544
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:57,210
As long as you get out of here,
fantastic meat.

1545
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:59,820
You,
your organic couldn't be healthier.

1546
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:03,120
They even serve it at the restaurant at
the four seasons in Lanai.

1547
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,393
You know?
It's just,

1548
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:05,310
God damn.
It's good.

1549
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,500
So good leaning good.
Oh,

1550
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:10,410
so delicious.
You feel the nutrition in it.

1551
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,160
It's just so fantastic,
you know?

1552
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,570
And when it comes to like sustainability
and ethics,

1553
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:17,760
it's like one of the best places.
Like that's the place where you actually

1554
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:20,340
should be hunting these animals.
You know,

1555
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,740
whenever I go to Hawaii,
I always just feel like I should show my

1556
01:03:22,741 --> 01:03:23,574
passport.
They like,

1557
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:26,430
it's just not America in stole that
Shit.

1558
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,460
That shit is straight up.
Like it's a foreign contract in a

1559
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:30,530
beautiful way.
Yeah.

1560
01:03:30,531 --> 01:03:32,370
In a beautiful way.
It's its own thing.

1561
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,031
Yeah.
I mean,

1562
01:03:33,031 --> 01:03:35,310
I liked the fact that you can go there
without a passport,

1563
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,530
but I agree.
But I'm one of those Weirdos that think

1564
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,510
there shouldn't be passports,
should be able to go anywhere.

1565
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:42,720
It's part of our problem.
But everybody's all locked into these

1566
01:03:42,721 --> 01:03:45,120
land masses.
Forbidden areas.

1567
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,350
Yeah.
Break those boundaries.

1568
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:47,490
Tear down that wall.

1569
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:53,270
I was just in Iraq and you talking about
some boundaries and sort of lines in the

1570
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:55,530
sand and so forth.
Boy,

1571
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,910
you know,
I'm sure.

1572
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:00,090
What were you doing over there?
So I went with,

1573
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,770
uh,
so back up,

1574
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:03,060
um,
two years ago,

1575
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:08,061
the earthquake in Nepal that killed
nine,

1576
01:04:08,101 --> 01:04:10,740
almost 10,000 people throughout the
country.

1577
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:13,060
19 on the mountain,
I'll never Australia.

1578
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:16,210
Yep.
A lot of people got dead and people

1579
01:04:16,211 --> 01:04:17,500
died.
And that one,

1580
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,670
was it an avalanche?

1581
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:19,843
Yeah,
well,

1582
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,290
so the earthquake triggered a lot of
glaciers that are hanging up around in

1583
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:28,580
that cirque and it released in a lot of
stuff just blew through base camp and

1584
01:04:28,581 --> 01:04:30,650
killed folks.
But throughout Nepal,

1585
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:33,800
throughout the countryside,
I mean we're talking villages that have

1586
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:37,490
stone huts and no motor and no rebar and
you know,

1587
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,550
just shakes just a little bit and she
falls down.

1588
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,400
I mean the place was desks.
It's a house of temples.

1589
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,741
Yeah.
So,

1590
01:04:44,741 --> 01:04:48,500
so lots of devastation,
lots of people dead and lots of

1591
01:04:48,501 --> 01:04:50,960
injuries.
So that day that happened,

1592
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:54,680
I knew I wanted to go to Nepal to help.
I'm a PA,

1593
01:04:54,681 --> 01:04:57,620
I'm a physician assistant and I've
specialized in emergency medicine.

1594
01:04:57,621 --> 01:05:01,670
So I knew I wanted to be there.
And more than anything like focused on

1595
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,950
sort of austere medicine.
You know,

1596
01:05:03,951 --> 01:05:07,760
like I want to go out there where Shit's
a little bit off and try and help the

1597
01:05:07,761 --> 01:05:08,594
best I can.

1598
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:13,990
So I went over there,
I located in an Ngo called Nyc medics

1599
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:18,790
and what's Ngo?
A nongovernmental organization.

1600
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:23,740
So not supplied or you know,
subsidized by the feds.

1601
01:05:23,741 --> 01:05:27,460
This is just like sponsorship.
Basically donation money gets you over

1602
01:05:27,461 --> 01:05:32,140
there and you do your work so you're not
under the auspices of the phets.

1603
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,650
So went over there with these guys,
Nyc medics,

1604
01:05:35,651 --> 01:05:40,360
which is a group of former and you know,
New York City paramedics that realize

1605
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:42,940
they wanted to take their skills and
could do some cool shit around the

1606
01:05:42,941 --> 01:05:44,330
world.
So I,

1607
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,600
I found these guys,
I went over with them.

1608
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,330
Um,
I was on the ground for a month way,

1609
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:52,810
way back,
like in the way back this place called

1610
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:56,500
dotting Bessie,
which is right at the base of the

1611
01:05:56,501 --> 01:06:00,070
connection mall.
So this is a place that we landed in

1612
01:06:00,071 --> 01:06:04,000
some helicopters and set up shop and
there was a lot of these Nepalis that

1613
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:06,520
Tamang Nepali there.

1614
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,260
That's their ethnic tribe,
not sure,

1615
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:10,600
but,
but Tamang they see the helicopter come

1616
01:06:10,601 --> 01:06:12,460
in and these white dudes get out of the
helicopter and like,

1617
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:15,160
what the fuck we need help.
Are you here to help?

1618
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,030
Yes,
we're here to help.

1619
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:19,420
So we had three helicopters worth of
gear downloaded.

1620
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:21,490
It's set up our clinic and we're there
for a month.

1621
01:06:21,491 --> 01:06:24,010
We saw,
I don't know,

1622
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:27,070
seven or 800 patients in the course of a
month.

1623
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:32,150
And what started as trauma from the
earthquake sort of then segwayed into

1624
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:38,730
primary care and infections and I mean
injuries and also believe it or not,

1625
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:44,371
like a lot of of of you know,
psychological pain.

1626
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:46,870
Like they were scared of the earth was
shaking still.

1627
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:49,240
I mean there was tremor after tremor,
after tremor,

1628
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:53,440
I mean every day the earth would shake.
I got home and for a month after I got

1629
01:06:53,441 --> 01:06:55,620
back from there,
I still felt the ground shake.

1630
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:56,560
And in Boulder,
Colorado,

1631
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:00,220
because it was just,
my body was still sort of equilibrium

1632
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:02,410
was weird.
So tremors every single day.

1633
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:04,360
So these people needed,
you know,

1634
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:05,650
anxiety,
medicines,

1635
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:07,180
you know,
to be able to take the edge off.

1636
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,210
So I was over there for a month,
we saw a bunch of people and it was very

1637
01:07:10,211 --> 01:07:12,610
worthwhile.
So it got connected to this,

1638
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,100
this,
this organization and became good

1639
01:07:15,101 --> 01:07:16,990
friends with,
with all the folks who run it and they

1640
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:19,750
do amazing work.
And so I got a call,

1641
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,470
uh,
in January from one of the heads of the

1642
01:07:23,471 --> 01:07:26,770
organization says,
we got this kind of Kooky thing that

1643
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:29,260
we've been asked to do by the World
Health Organization.

1644
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,600
Would you be interested?
Kooky.

1645
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:33,380
Kooky.
The word,

1646
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,990
that's the word he used.
Kooky,

1647
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,260
Kooky cheese.
Just so who the fuck uses Kooky?

1648
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,850
So it,
well,

1649
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,610
I mean it comes to going to Iraq,
12 years in medical school,

1650
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:45,360
not understanding what it was.
Fire is,

1651
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,340
it was a little bit cookie.
So He's,

1652
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,270
he frames it up for me and he's like,
listen,

1653
01:07:49,271 --> 01:07:52,000
here's what's going on.
We've been asked by the World Health

1654
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,750
Organization to go in and be a trauma
stabilization point in Mosul,

1655
01:07:56,710 --> 01:08:01,710
which means you will be as close to the
front line as possible.

1656
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:07,190
Embedded with the Iraqi special
operations forces and your job will be

1657
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:12,610
to lead a medical team of,
we had nine of us,

1658
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,430
um,
um,

1659
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:16,670
within 2000

1660
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:20,360
meters of the front line.
That was the way it was framed up and

1661
01:08:20,361 --> 01:08:22,820
that's what we all sort of signed up
for.

1662
01:08:22,821 --> 01:08:24,890
And that was the agreement with the
World Health Organization.

1663
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:29,891
And so we would be the first point of
contact as these Iraqi special

1664
01:08:30,501 --> 01:08:34,070
operations guys were going in and
putting the fight to isis to liberate

1665
01:08:34,071 --> 01:08:35,900
western Mozel.
So,

1666
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:37,250
you know,
eastern Mozal been limited.

1667
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:38,600
We're liberated,
you know,

1668
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:41,900
months before.
And he volunteered for this by the way.

1669
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:45,590
So that's all eastern Mosul and the
[inaudible] side of the Tigers.

1670
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:47,030
And then on the west side,
you know,

1671
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:51,200
Isis was still sort of dug in right
there and they were there ready to put

1672
01:08:51,201 --> 01:08:53,690
the fight down.
They wanted to get after it and save,

1673
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,790
you know,
that's where their caliphates supposedly

1674
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:57,680
started or was,
was settled.

1675
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:01,310
And so our job is to Tsp.
That's trauma stabilization point was to

1676
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,450
be as close to the front lines.

1677
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,920
We could be.
And this is the,

1678
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,310
this was a kicker,
you know,

1679
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:08,510
within a margin of safety,
but still be close enough to where we

1680
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:12,320
could receive the casualties as quickly
as possible,

1681
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:16,970
stabilize them and then get them to a
Ford operating operating suite,

1682
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,570
which was typically run by allied
forces.

1683
01:09:20,571 --> 01:09:22,340
So our guys,
so,

1684
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,880
um,
I said yes before I asked my wife,

1685
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:30,050
um,
which now in retrospect probably wasn't

1686
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:32,600
the best strategy.
Um,

1687
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:37,100
cause she was not super stoked,
but she,

1688
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,091
uh,
you know,

1689
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:43,091
I pitched it to her and I've got an 11
year old kid and she gave me I think the

1690
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:52,160
least amount of pushback as anybody
around me and my close network.

1691
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:55,010
I mean a lot of my boys were like the
fuck dude.

1692
01:09:55,011 --> 01:09:56,440
What are you thinking man?
Like what's,

1693
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:57,830
what are you getting?
What's your point?

1694
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,060
What are you doing this for?

1695
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:03,020
What's your intention to go over there
to a war zone,

1696
01:10:03,021 --> 01:10:05,240
to a combat zone,
volunteering,

1697
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:06,074
you know,
and,

1698
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:07,460
and,
and,

1699
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:10,730
and helping a group of people that you
have no affinity for.

1700
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:13,610
It made sense going into Paul,
cause I love Nepal,

1701
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,600
I love,
I love everything about Nepal.

1702
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,930
Love the Nepali people,
so that good.

1703
01:10:17,931 --> 01:10:19,730
Everybody got that.
That's the weird thing about jeff

1704
01:10:19,731 --> 01:10:21,650
because he was on the phone with me the
same time saying,

1705
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:23,120
Hey,
are we going back to Everest?

1706
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,220
Go rescue.
So he's going to no matter what,

1707
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,250
sometime in the spring he can put his
ass on the line to help save people.

1708
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,140
He was calling me again,
we're going back and I'm like,

1709
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,050
I don't know if we're going back,
the network may order another season.

1710
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:35,880
We'd probably go back and I started
lining stuff up and just in case then it

1711
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:37,410
was aired yet.

1712
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

1713
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,120
Ever stared.
The name of the show is ever stare at

1714
01:10:40,121 --> 01:10:40,521
air.
Uh,

1715
01:10:40,521 --> 01:10:44,180
November of last year.
Everest air and what network to the

1716
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,150
airline travel channel.
Six episodes on travel channel.

1717
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,730
It's on itunes and couple of other
places too.

1718
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,230
Okay.
So people could get it right?

1719
01:10:51,231 --> 01:10:51,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

1720
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:52,603
So,
uh,

1721
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:56,300
so you tell you wife.
Yeah.

1722
01:10:56,301 --> 01:10:56,931
And she,
you know,

1723
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:58,880
she knew what she signed up for when,
uh,

1724
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,350
you know,
when she married me.

1725
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:03,020
So she knew she was kind of getting a
little bit of a,

1726
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,060
you know,
a little bit of a,

1727
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:07,790
of a wild book in her hands,
but,

1728
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,650
um,
this was different,

1729
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:10,880
you know,
I can go climbing,

1730
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:14,340
I can set my sights on this and that get
out there in the mountains

1731
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,650
or do adventure races and stuff and all
that's cool.

1732
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:17,670
But then,
you know,

1733
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,480
mad respect to the men and women that
serve in our military man and put it out

1734
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:23,520
there every day.
But I had never been in a combat zone

1735
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:24,780
and that shit is crazy,
man.

1736
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:25,561
I mean,
it is,

1737
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:28,290
it was real.
Um,

1738
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,330
and I have no,
uh,

1739
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:35,070
predications that I had any experience
close to what our men and women have

1740
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:37,590
experienced.
But from a medical perspective,

1741
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,250
it was intense to say the least.
I mean,

1742
01:11:41,251 --> 01:11:43,200
it was a mind bender at the first,
after,

1743
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:46,650
after the first three days,
I remember texting my wife just saying

1744
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:48,690
like,
I don't know if this is sustainable,

1745
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,940
like just this,
my emotional state,

1746
01:11:50,941 --> 01:11:55,941
because every day was immense volume of
profound penetrating trauma.

1747
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:58,613
Panic.
I mean,

1748
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:00,150
never was there.
Very,

1749
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:02,670
very rarely was there a guy who had one
gunshot wound,

1750
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:04,260
typically,
you know,

1751
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:05,250
seven or eight or nine.

1752
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:06,940
They were leaking from there,
you know,

1753
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,180
from lots of places.
You know,

1754
01:12:09,181 --> 01:12:13,590
these dudes were getting shot up and
then the ids and um,

1755
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,390
would blow these guys up and we would
get them,

1756
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,680
you know,
they'd be youngest.

1757
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,990
This was just screaming and drop these
guys off.

1758
01:12:18,991 --> 01:12:21,660
And then five minutes later,
another ambulance would come in with two

1759
01:12:21,661 --> 01:12:23,580
other dudes.
And it was just constant,

1760
01:12:23,581 --> 01:12:27,450
constant.
And we would do the best we could,

1761
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:31,140
um,
to stabilize them or call it.

1762
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:34,650
And um,
the ones we could save,

1763
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:37,380
we package them up and stabilize and try
to control the bleeding.

1764
01:12:37,381 --> 01:12:40,890
We'd intubate him if we needed to and
put chest tubes in and,

1765
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:45,710
and crack them in some cases and
stabilize their extremities and pat's

1766
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:50,460
their halls and then send them on.
He would do these weekly daily blogs,

1767
01:12:50,461 --> 01:12:51,630
right?
So people who know him,

1768
01:12:51,631 --> 01:12:52,560
Rove there,
we're waiting,

1769
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,990
watching CNN,
seeing if he's going to be on what he

1770
01:12:54,991 --> 01:12:55,620
was.

1771
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,420
And he'd do these daily blogs,
these long,

1772
01:12:57,421 --> 01:13:00,000
long diatribe,
which is I think how he stays somewhat

1773
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:02,610
sane,
but to get shot at,

1774
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:06,900
there's motors come in and their
compound to where are these blocks on my

1775
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:08,060
blog?
Um,

1776
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:08,941
which is,
yeah,

1777
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:10,340
it's on my website,
Jeff Bm.

1778
01:13:10,341 --> 01:13:11,810
And so there's,
I like to write,

1779
01:13:11,811 --> 01:13:15,990
do you haven't dot com [inaudible] dot
com so I like to write and Budgie right.

1780
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,730
And I like to have the time.
Well,

1781
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:21,150
so this is what I would do at night.
Like if I would lay down and we were

1782
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,070
sleeping on the floor on these,
you know,

1783
01:13:23,071 --> 01:13:25,980
these Iraqi blankets,
you know,

1784
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:27,660
and we would just lay down on this,
we,

1785
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:31,320
so we'd go into these abandoned homes
and we'd set up these trauma bays and

1786
01:13:31,321 --> 01:13:34,530
we'd sleep in a room off the trauma bay.
And so I,

1787
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,070
you know,
we,

1788
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:35,920
we do our day.

1789
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:39,600
I,
I very rarely wasn't dressed and ready

1790
01:13:39,601 --> 01:13:43,620
to get up and go because then any tom,
the head logistician,

1791
01:13:43,621 --> 01:13:45,960
we'd be like patients,
you know,

1792
01:13:45,961 --> 01:13:48,400
and everybody would pop up and get
ready,

1793
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:50,580
didn't go out.
And the ambulance would throw people on.

1794
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:54,510
Mostly during the day,
but fighting with generally subside at

1795
01:13:54,511 --> 01:13:58,530
night and we'd get a little bit of rest
and then I'd write and I'd write and it

1796
01:13:58,531 --> 01:14:01,160
was important I think to sort of,
you know,

1797
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,660
percolate that shit out a little bit and
let it,

1798
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,520
let it sit.
So we were,

1799
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:10,521
we were in this one place for a couple
of weeks and then came the request from,

1800
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:15,010
uh,
the head of ice off special operations,

1801
01:14:15,011 --> 01:14:18,310
General Abbas,
and he's came to our head logistical gal

1802
01:14:18,311 --> 01:14:19,120
and he's like,
listen,

1803
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,760
you know,
as the front line is moving forward,

1804
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:27,120
we would like for you guys if you are up
for it to move forward as well.

1805
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,230
The only problem is,
um,

1806
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:34,570
it's not going to be within that 10 to
2,500,

1807
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:36,000
you know,
um,

1808
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:41,460
meter cushion from the front line.
It's going to be more like 500 meters

1809
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:44,800
from the front line.
500 meters.

1810
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:46,270
Yeah.
Which,

1811
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,020
you know,
that's really class really close,

1812
01:14:50,021 --> 01:14:52,540
especially since the front line is
pretty fluid anyway.

1813
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:54,730
Right.
And this is a conventional warfare,

1814
01:14:54,731 --> 01:14:55,810
right?
These guys are,

1815
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:57,880
you know,
they're isis is,

1816
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,090
was reinforcing these,
these vehicles.

1817
01:15:01,091 --> 01:15:01,540
And,
you know,

1818
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:04,120
steel plate,
and I'm up and then taking civilians and

1819
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,580
handcuffing them to the,
you know,

1820
01:15:06,581 --> 01:15:10,080
to these steering wheels and tell him
you best job and they drive and then

1821
01:15:10,081 --> 01:15:13,810
they'd be packful of explosives and c
four and they blow them up,

1822
01:15:13,811 --> 01:15:14,644
you know,
and,

1823
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:15,341
and,
you know,

1824
01:15:15,341 --> 01:15:18,160
these are guys would,
Iraqi dudes would be like trying to pelt

1825
01:15:18,161 --> 01:15:19,660
him to take the dude out.
I couldn't get,

1826
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:23,110
you know,
like Shit was really archaic but

1827
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:24,390
effective,
you know,

1828
01:15:24,391 --> 01:15:26,350
and so,
so they told us,

1829
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:27,880
you know,
we'd like for you to move.

1830
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:31,960
And then our head logistical gow Cathy,
she's came to the whole team and she

1831
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:32,800
said,
this is our,

1832
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:35,950
this is our option.
You don't have to do it.

1833
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:37,810
You know,
no one's obligated to do it.

1834
01:15:37,811 --> 01:15:38,990
Y'All are volunteers.
And,

1835
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:41,210
and,
and we,

1836
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:42,850
by the way,
we were close to begin with.

1837
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,810
I mean,
it was,

1838
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,140
it was constant every day,
just mortars and small arms fire.

1839
01:15:47,141 --> 01:15:49,180
And there was bunch of,
um,

1840
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:50,320
of,
of,

1841
01:15:50,321 --> 01:15:51,154
uh,
of,

1842
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:54,010
of artillery that was set up all around
us,

1843
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:57,700
outgoing.
So we got used to the sound of outgoing

1844
01:15:57,701 --> 01:16:01,600
artillery,
but we didn't hear a lot of incoming,

1845
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,430
um,
because they just did pushed him back.

1846
01:16:03,431 --> 01:16:03,881
So,
okay.

1847
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:05,500
We all said,
let's do it,

1848
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:07,720
you know,
if we can create positive impact and we

1849
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:10,030
can save more lives by being closer,
let's do it.

1850
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:14,020
So we all gotten this big osh kosh and
Humvee,

1851
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:17,590
um,
convoy and uh,

1852
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,290
and drove down past the airport.

1853
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,060
And I think a lot of military folks that
listen,

1854
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:23,860
we'll know that airport,
um,

1855
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:25,990
in west Mosul very well,
probably.

1856
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,300
We drove right through the old busted
up,

1857
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,770
you know,
you know,

1858
01:16:29,771 --> 01:16:31,750
it was just rubble,
the whole airports rebel.

1859
01:16:31,751 --> 01:16:34,000
It's just completely,
it looks like fucking,

1860
01:16:34,001 --> 01:16:36,460
you know,
bedrock flintstones,

1861
01:16:36,461 --> 01:16:37,540
you know,
it's just a mess.

1862
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:41,770
Drove all the way through there and then
went to this house and we set up our

1863
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:44,610
clinic on a street corner,
um,

1864
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:48,670
covered by an a corrugated metal roof
and put all our,

1865
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,000
and we put six trauma beds and got her
traumas,

1866
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:52,690
sleeves up and everything was ready to
go.

1867
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:55,870
And then we,
we set up our residents across the

1868
01:16:55,871 --> 01:16:57,820
street at,
uh,

1869
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,480
some other abandoned house and we're
down in the sort of concrete bunker,

1870
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:06,010
so to speak.
And we started seeing patients and,

1871
01:17:06,011 --> 01:17:07,120
you know,
day one,

1872
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,450
shit ton of people and of lots of things
happen.

1873
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:13,610
I mean,
talking dozens and dozens of,

1874
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,570
you know,
multiple gunshot when paces multiple

1875
01:17:17,571 --> 01:17:22,490
careers that I experienced in that month
of just the flow of volume of,

1876
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,500
of penetrating trauma.
So then,

1877
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,453
then,
uh,

1878
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:30,260
it was day two or three,
all these displaced locals,

1879
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,230
um,
basically got released,

1880
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:37,790
so they'd been holding him at a
checkpoint fingerprint and the fighting

1881
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:41,570
age males,
making sure they're not on a record and,

1882
01:17:41,571 --> 01:17:43,010
you know,
making sure everybody's not,

1883
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,370
not strapped and letting them through.
So on day three or four,

1884
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:50,420
they just let this flow of humanity
started walking down the street,

1885
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:53,450
about 60,
70 yards from us,

1886
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:58,400
from where we were set up.
And they'd see the Americans and they'd

1887
01:17:58,401 --> 01:18:02,240
see the stethoscopes and they just start
running towards us because these people

1888
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:05,870
had been captivated for,
uh,

1889
01:18:05,871 --> 01:18:06,830
in,
in,

1890
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:09,530
you know,
held captive and hiding out in their

1891
01:18:09,531 --> 01:18:11,360
basements,
eaten grass,

1892
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:15,450
you know,
trying to find any fluids at all to

1893
01:18:15,451 --> 01:18:15,770
drink.

1894
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:16,990
There's no rain water,
you know,

1895
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:18,560
is this fucking rain there.
And,

1896
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:20,930
and uh,
just just eking by.

1897
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:23,150
And little kids,
I mean there's just civilians,

1898
01:18:23,151 --> 01:18:26,060
these little bitty kids and they're
hiding out in these,

1899
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:28,160
in these homes.
And they would just run,

1900
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:31,160
they would just take off running and get
to these checkpoints.

1901
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:32,950
So on day three or something,
they,

1902
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:36,350
this flow of humanity comes by.
You guys are starting to sort of bum

1903
01:18:36,351 --> 01:18:40,520
rush our spot and everybody starts to
get a little bit panicked cause we

1904
01:18:40,521 --> 01:18:43,010
weren't quite sure what was,
what,

1905
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:44,120
you know,
there's a lot,

1906
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,950
it turns out a lot of bad things can
happen,

1907
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,420
you know,
in that situation.

1908
01:18:47,421 --> 01:18:51,710
So we sort of get our,
our security detail to keep everybody

1909
01:18:51,711 --> 01:18:54,410
away and we,
we treat a shit ton of people.

1910
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:59,450
Day four rolls around and we wake up
that morning.

1911
01:18:59,451 --> 01:19:04,310
And the first patient I have is a five
year old little girl that had been just

1912
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,090
absolutely like homicide,
like killed shot right in the head,

1913
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:10,100
assassinated and back of the head,
back of the head.

1914
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:12,500
Yeah.
And that was how our day started at like

1915
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,230
seven in the morning.
That was it.

1916
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:17,360
And the day got worse.
So,

1917
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:22,480
um,
the first incoming landed about,

1918
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:27,620
um,
I'd say about 75 yards from us,

1919
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,410
an RPG.
It landed in the neighbor in the

1920
01:19:30,411 --> 01:19:34,430
neighbor's yard next to us and it just
blew a bunch of debris up and it landed

1921
01:19:34,431 --> 01:19:38,870
on our corrugated roof there.
And we were all like,

1922
01:19:38,871 --> 01:19:40,550
damn.
But we kept working.

1923
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,560
Then 10 minutes later,
maybe another one came in and it was 50

1924
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:48,950
yards and just getting closer this
second,

1925
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:52,640
it's called a grid as a clit and he just
get a little click 50,

1926
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:55,010
25.
So we didn't know it at the top though,

1927
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:55,750
but yeah,
you're right.

1928
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:58,160
That we did not know this at the time.
So,

1929
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:02,580
uh,
that one obviously got everybody Super

1930
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:03,020
Tingley.
Um,

1931
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:06,290
but there was still a shit ton of people
coming in.

1932
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:11,070
We had patients mean we were working and
we had our kevlar vests on and we were

1933
01:20:11,071 --> 01:20:11,701
trying to,
you know,

1934
01:20:11,701 --> 01:20:16,680
say then,
then the third one hit and it landed,

1935
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:21,480
um,
right outside the door and it blew a

1936
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,100
shit ton of debris.
I mean,

1937
01:20:23,101 --> 01:20:27,660
we felt the blast and one of our medics
got a big piece of debris in the back

1938
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:28,920
was leg.
It knocked him down.

1939
01:20:28,921 --> 01:20:32,610
So we went into this bunker,
basically the staging bunker and we sat

1940
01:20:32,611 --> 01:20:36,180
down in there and you know,
no matter what,

1941
01:20:36,181 --> 01:20:39,780
we couldn't,
we weren't going to go out into that.

1942
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:43,320
But then 30 seconds later,
um,

1943
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,270
one of our,
uh,

1944
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:50,310
security detail dudes carried in our
head of security and he was lifeless and

1945
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:52,830
dropped him on the table.
This is the dude we'd been,

1946
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,350
you know,
eating cookies with and drinking tea

1947
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:58,020
with like a half hour before,
an hour before,

1948
01:20:58,050 --> 01:20:59,340
you know,
standing at the door,

1949
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:00,630
uh,
in between,

1950
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:02,490
you know,
ambulances czar,

1951
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,690
czar guy,
you know,

1952
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,553
and he was dead.

1953
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:07,920
And so we all looked at each other and I
was the team lead.

1954
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:09,090
And I tell you,
man,

1955
01:21:09,091 --> 01:21:12,030
I wasn't about to ask anybody to go out
into that.

1956
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,350
And no one even hesitated.
Like we went out and started working on

1957
01:21:16,351 --> 01:21:18,270
how Steve and we,
we,

1958
01:21:18,271 --> 01:21:21,600
uh,
we got on and quick and he was out and I

1959
01:21:21,601 --> 01:21:23,670
listened to his lungs.
He didn't have any lung sounds.

1960
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:26,700
On one side.
I saw penetrating entry wound in his

1961
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:28,560
chest,
put a chest tube in his,

1962
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:29,820
in his,
uh,

1963
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:30,810
right,
uh,

1964
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:34,800
and his right thorax and about a liter
of blood poured out from his pleural

1965
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:37,410
space just like that.
And as soon as that happened,

1966
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:40,560
he could inspire again.
And so we started breathing and

1967
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,400
resuscitated him.
So he was dead and he came back to lunch

1968
01:21:44,401 --> 01:21:45,810
and he was,
he was,

1969
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:48,960
he was unable to,
to inspire.

1970
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:49,950
So,
you know,

1971
01:21:49,951 --> 01:21:52,800
his whole body had shut down from number
one,

1972
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:54,900
from the shock blast.
Right.

1973
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,140
And,
and being hit that hard by,

1974
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:01,800
by a piece of shrapnel and just being
that close to the impact.

1975
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,270
But then also,
you know,

1976
01:22:03,271 --> 01:22:07,080
there's penetrating a piece of shrapnel
went right through his chest and didn't

1977
01:22:07,081 --> 01:22:11,580
hit any of his vital organs,
just cause this hemothorax this blood to

1978
01:22:11,581 --> 01:22:13,350
fill up in his plural space.
So,

1979
01:22:13,351 --> 01:22:15,510
you know,
I evacuated all that blood and he

1980
01:22:15,511 --> 01:22:17,820
started to be able to breathe again.
So there he is,

1981
01:22:17,821 --> 01:22:19,110
he's back.
We get him out,

1982
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,870
we go back inside the,
the uh,

1983
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:24,600
the bunker there and a couple of hours
later we got out.

1984
01:22:24,601 --> 01:22:29,601
So we find out the next day that a dude,
not a fighting age,

1985
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:36,620
a local guy was a sleeper cell and that
he had come back in the neighborhood and

1986
01:22:37,171 --> 01:22:42,171
was three or four houses down and was
communicating with his operatives,

1987
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:45,540
his Isis Bros,
you know,

1988
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:49,020
two,
300 meters away and was releasing

1989
01:22:49,021 --> 01:22:51,690
pigeons to identify our position.

1990
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,960
So the way they figured this out,
one of our security guys would see a

1991
01:22:54,961 --> 01:22:57,330
pigeon go up and he didn't think much
about it.

1992
01:22:57,331 --> 01:23:00,270
And then a mortar hit and then,
you know,

1993
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:03,360
10 minutes later he's like,
there was no pigeons around there.

1994
01:23:03,361 --> 01:23:04,171
Right?
Cause I mean,

1995
01:23:04,171 --> 01:23:07,570
Shit's crazy.
It's combat zone and birds don't dig

1996
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:11,560
combat zones.
So he kind of started to piece it

1997
01:23:11,561 --> 01:23:14,800
together and then he realized on the
third one he's like,

1998
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:17,050
he saw a pigeon go up and he goes,
we're about to get hit.

1999
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:20,740
Sure enough.
So we got out of there,

2000
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,880
saves us,
he gives life.

2001
01:23:21,881 --> 01:23:25,600
He got out and they went and found this
dude and got his phone.

2002
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:27,640
And sure enough he was doing all this.
Any admitted it.

2003
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:28,533
He was like,
Yep,

2004
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:29,800
that was me.
I was doing,

2005
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:31,990
I was releasing pigeons to identify your
spot.

2006
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,530
And I was told they took care of the
situation.

2007
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:38,170
That was what they tried to kill the
American tour and trying to help

2008
01:23:38,171 --> 01:23:39,160
everybody.
Well,

2009
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:40,990
yeah.
So I just wanted us,

2010
01:23:40,991 --> 01:23:42,760
I mean,
they wanted to get us because we were

2011
01:23:42,761 --> 01:23:43,750
there.
We were helping the enemy.

2012
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:45,880
Right.
So that was,

2013
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,880
that was a couple months ago.
So they documented on his,

2014
01:23:48,881 --> 01:23:51,470
on his website,
CNN was interviewing him and there

2015
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,030
there's mortars dropping crazy.
Yeah.

2016
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:56,770
It was heavy.
It took a little you over there for

2017
01:23:56,771 --> 01:23:57,960
about a month.
Yeah.

2018
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,710
But aside,
when you're leaving,

2019
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:01,870
well there was,
they knew this,

2020
01:24:01,871 --> 01:24:04,990
this nyc medics,
they knew this ngo knows like it was

2021
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:07,120
hard to sustain that,
you know,

2022
01:24:07,121 --> 01:24:10,750
I mean,
the concentration of can't help but

2023
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:11,411
affect you.
I mean,

2024
01:24:11,411 --> 01:24:14,860
that's why so many of our,
our military folks have such profound

2025
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:15,880
ptsd,
right.

2026
01:24:15,881 --> 01:24:17,920
It's just from getting your ass kicked.
Like damn,

2027
01:24:17,921 --> 01:24:21,280
these guys go through these deployments
that were just months on end of that.

2028
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:24,760
Right.
And you just can't imagine how much,

2029
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:26,890
you know,
how that hurts and then go back to

2030
01:24:26,891 --> 01:24:28,900
Kansas and they had to go to the grocery
store.

2031
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:29,900
Yeah.
It's,

2032
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:31,510
it's,
it's hard to fathom,

2033
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:33,670
you know,
the black tar tootsie rolls,

2034
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:35,521
right.
So,

2035
01:24:35,521 --> 01:24:37,410
so social,
it's not black tar.

2036
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,440
The fuck it is.
I'm just

2037
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:44,230
Johnny Cash in their dope,
these young kids.

2038
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:45,851
Wow.
Yeah.

2039
01:24:45,851 --> 01:24:47,610
So that was Kinda,
it took me a little bit to,

2040
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:48,610
to,
uh,

2041
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,770
to roll out of that and thank God for my
wife,

2042
01:24:50,771 --> 01:24:52,870
man.
She came back and we went on a run up in

2043
01:24:52,871 --> 01:24:56,650
the hills like a few days later and we
got up to the top of this hill and I

2044
01:24:56,651 --> 01:24:59,080
just,
I just cried on her shoulder.

2045
01:24:59,081 --> 01:25:00,730
I just let it go.
And since then I'm,

2046
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:03,880
I'm fine.
But it gives me such a deep appreciation

2047
01:25:03,881 --> 01:25:08,260
for how hard it must be for,
you know,

2048
01:25:08,261 --> 01:25:12,130
for these men and women who come back
from these deployments and they've been

2049
01:25:12,131 --> 01:25:15,490
a part of these things and,
and been affected so profoundly.

2050
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:16,323
It's,
it's,

2051
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:17,920
it's got to hurt.
You know,

2052
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:22,990
I'm on a very deep emotional level.
I can only imagine,

2053
01:25:22,991 --> 01:25:25,450
man,
what a crazy life you live helping

2054
01:25:25,451 --> 01:25:29,360
people that are involved in traumatic
situations over and over again,

2055
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:33,430
various traumatic situations,
whether it's getting stuck on Kaytoo or

2056
01:25:33,431 --> 01:25:35,200
whether it's getting,
yeah,

2057
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:36,960
but he seeks it out.
That's what he does.

2058
01:25:36,961 --> 01:25:38,170
I just wanted to bring him,
he sees like,

2059
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:41,200
what am I going to do this spring that's
going to change 50 people's lives?

2060
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:43,960
Where's Kate too?
That's the twos in Pakistan.

2061
01:25:43,961 --> 01:25:44,840
Pakistan.
Yeah,

2062
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,720
that's a,
is that a more dangerous one than the

2063
01:25:47,721 --> 01:25:49,930
first?
I think generally the consensus is it's

2064
01:25:49,931 --> 01:25:52,060
more technical.
It's more dangerous and it's not as

2065
01:25:52,061 --> 01:25:52,960
commercialized.
Right.

2066
01:25:52,961 --> 01:25:55,090
So it's not a same more technical.
What do they mean by that?

2067
01:25:55,091 --> 01:25:58,060
Well,
there's this longer bits of terrain that

2068
01:25:58,061 --> 01:26:01,390
require more high level technical
climbing skill,

2069
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:04,130
so more exposed,
steeper,

2070
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,450
you know,
more,

2071
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:06,290
uh,
you know,

2072
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:10,970
longer stretches of,
of hanging it out there kind of terrain.

2073
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,540
You better have your shit dialed or
you're going to get smoked and you,

2074
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:19,570
and when they go on these like I'm crazy
hikes that you have to have very

2075
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:22,430
specific kind of gear too.
Right?

2076
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:25,670
Like they must have like the clothing
pretty dialed in.

2077
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:26,720
I mean,
look,

2078
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:28,250
remember this pictures of Mallory,
right?

2079
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,230
Yeah.
It's come like this dude was in wool,

2080
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,360
which by the way,
we'll,

2081
01:26:31,361 --> 01:26:32,390
it's pretty good.
Pretty good.

2082
01:26:32,391 --> 01:26:33,021
Yeah.
It's pretty good.

2083
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,550
Better than cotton.
A lot there in cotton.

2084
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,950
Um,
but now,

2085
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:37,900
you know,
it's,

2086
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:41,210
it's a matter of getting the right gear
that works.

2087
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,890
Um,
and you can rely on it.

2088
01:26:42,891 --> 01:26:43,351
You know,
it's,

2089
01:26:43,351 --> 01:26:47,000
I mean,
I don't want to be 20 miles back and you

2090
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:49,370
know,
in the back country hunting elk and have

2091
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:52,880
my thermarest have a hole in it.
So I slept in the dirt for five days,

2092
01:26:52,881 --> 01:26:54,290
which is what happened to me last fall.

2093
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:56,660
I was by myself and you know,
it was way,

2094
01:26:56,661 --> 01:26:58,310
way back in the first night.
You know,

2095
01:26:58,311 --> 01:27:01,000
my thermarest had a whole lot and now I
don't know,

2096
01:27:01,001 --> 01:27:04,100
it's late in the dirt for five nights.
How was that Dick off?

2097
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,210
Yeah,
you get cold from it to fluff your pad.

2098
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:09,940
Clipped my,
I have to put my pack on it.

2099
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:11,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

2100
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:14,540
I've had some nights like that.
So yeah.

2101
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:16,520
Maybe you were upset because he had a
hole in your air mattress.

2102
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:18,200
It was,
it was flat,

2103
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:20,900
man.
I had nothing I'd done the Japanese guy

2104
01:27:20,901 --> 01:27:22,520
cause he had a hole in his matches.
Well,

2105
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:24,920
which guy?
The guy that came down.

2106
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:27,170
Yeah.
Well he called a helicopter and I sucked

2107
01:27:27,171 --> 01:27:29,450
it up.
He called the helicopter him because he

2108
01:27:29,451 --> 01:27:31,670
had a hole in his mattress.
This is funny story.

2109
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:34,640
So we,
I got a call said there's a Japanese guy

2110
01:27:34,641 --> 01:27:36,260
and he's dying at camp to dying.

2111
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:37,410
Dying.
Yeah.

2112
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:39,260
It's telling everybody's fucking dying.
He's dying.

2113
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:40,730
So we were like,
Holy Shit.

2114
01:27:40,731 --> 01:27:41,300
All right.
I was like,

2115
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,070
I got to get the helicopter,
get a helicopter.

2116
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:47,570
They risk their lives.
They go up there and get him fly him

2117
01:27:47,571 --> 01:27:50,600
down base camp base camp to Luke Lowe
where our race station was.

2118
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,880
Get that helicopter and I'll let jeff
take over.

2119
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:54,230
Well,
yeah.

2120
01:27:54,231 --> 01:27:57,680
And then I started asking him,
he's just pleasant as he can be and

2121
01:27:58,100 --> 01:27:59,210
what's going on?
Do you hurt?

2122
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,350
You have pain,
you know,

2123
01:28:00,351 --> 01:28:02,690
it was very,
very tired,

2124
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,943
very,
very tired.

2125
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,420
Um,
whole in mattress and I,

2126
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,440
you have a woody what?
And he said,

2127
01:28:09,441 --> 01:28:14,441
I have a holding a mattress and he was
at camp two and was sleeping in the snow

2128
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:18,670
and had a hole in his mattress and
didn't tell anybody.

2129
01:28:18,671 --> 01:28:20,810
He just was basically,
he was done like we were talking about

2130
01:28:20,811 --> 01:28:21,531
earlier,
like he's just,

2131
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:26,531
he was done and because he's got money,
he's calls in the calvary says bring the

2132
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:28,010
helicopter.

2133
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:30,110
Jeff was pissed.
I was fucking pissed.

2134
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:32,240
Hist is a lot of people risk their
lives.

2135
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:37,270
I saw a dude on Denali do that and it
base camp in 1996 or seven this dude

2136
01:28:37,311 --> 01:28:40,670
shows up with a,
I like a boy scout,

2137
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,510
old school boy Scout,
like we below looking fucking thing,

2138
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:47,390
you know,
like made of cotton I guess.

2139
01:28:47,391 --> 01:28:49,730
You know,
it's like some weird synthetic shit.

2140
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:50,520
And I,
he's,

2141
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,870
he asked me for a knife to be able to
cut the plastic off of it,

2142
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:54,830
you know,
and,

2143
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:55,790
and I'm like,
man,

2144
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:57,530
that's not a good idea.
Where are you going?

2145
01:28:57,531 --> 01:28:59,540
And I didn't want to,
I should have questioned him.

2146
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,190
Two weeks later we get a call,
have to go up to 17,000

2147
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:07,190
feet for a guy who had broken his ankle.
So we land the helicopter down at 17 and

2148
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:12,120
he runs towards the helicopter,
which everybody knows is you don't run

2149
01:29:12,121 --> 01:29:13,490
towards the helicopter.
It makes a little lift.

2150
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,030
He runs to the helicopter.
I'm like,

2151
01:29:15,031 --> 01:29:17,430
he's got a,
so it turns out he was just cold.

2152
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:22,530
I'm telling you man,
like a lot of people just tap out and

2153
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:25,410
because they know there's an
infrastructure around that,

2154
01:29:25,411 --> 01:29:29,130
we'll pull them out instead of being
accountable for themselves.

2155
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:32,310
That's where I get pissed.
So we pulled this guy off and we

2156
01:29:32,311 --> 01:29:35,130
interviewed them and then jeff goes the
nicest thing.

2157
01:29:35,131 --> 01:29:36,270
He says,
have a nice life,

2158
01:29:36,271 --> 01:29:38,200
walks up and just started to cuss it and
Piss.

2159
01:29:38,201 --> 01:29:39,590
He's paid.
He didn't want to do an interview with

2160
01:29:39,591 --> 01:29:43,170
just the Johnny's gun in want to talk
about them and to know when you need.

2161
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:45,340
It's very dangerous to fly a helicopter
that out too.

2162
01:29:45,341 --> 01:29:46,081
Right?
Selfish.

2163
01:29:46,081 --> 01:29:48,030
Anything can go wrong.
I mean we are,

2164
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:50,610
our helicopter pilots were up.
I mean,

2165
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:54,690
absolutely the other,
the military pilots got to be the best

2166
01:29:54,691 --> 01:29:56,250
helicopter pilots in the world.
I mean,

2167
01:29:56,251 --> 01:30:01,251
these guys are so skilled and understand
what those conditions make you do as a

2168
01:30:02,131 --> 01:30:02,970
pilot.
It's,

2169
01:30:02,971 --> 01:30:04,740
it was,
it was phenomenal.

2170
01:30:04,741 --> 01:30:06,850
But that being said,
machines break.

2171
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,950
I put him in a helicopter one time.
I put it the one to helicopters one time

2172
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:14,070
and that helicopter and that pilot are
dead now.

2173
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:15,660
Yeah.
From that.

2174
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:16,501
Well,
no,

2175
01:30:16,501 --> 01:30:19,000
like a few months later I was in the
front with Daca.

2176
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:20,580
How I'm fine.
He crashed into a cliff.

2177
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:23,490
Won't they won't name the company,
but yeah,

2178
01:30:23,491 --> 01:30:25,710
we that there was a one little flight,
we put them in there.

2179
01:30:25,711 --> 01:30:28,410
Yeah.
And then a rack that was a rickety old

2180
01:30:28,411 --> 01:30:29,244
helicopter

2181
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:34,310
do all these really high stressful,
high danger sort of situations.

2182
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:41,150
You're constantly around people that
have this extremely high threshold for

2183
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,880
the extremely high tolerance to
discomfort,

2184
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:46,710
to uh,
you know,

2185
01:30:46,711 --> 01:30:51,300
pushing your endurance levels,
overcoming obstacles.

2186
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:54,960
Like be you,
you're around people that are like

2187
01:30:54,961 --> 01:30:58,260
really solid human beings.
Like they're very on.

2188
01:30:58,290 --> 01:31:01,410
Like we were talking about people that
are willing to summit Everest people

2189
01:31:01,411 --> 01:31:03,180
that'll rescue people.
That summit Everest,

2190
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:08,360
people that are willing to do these
medical stations 500 yards or 500 meters

2191
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:12,570
from the front line.
I mean,

2192
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:16,500
you're talking about some really solid
human beings,

2193
01:31:16,501 --> 01:31:19,170
very,
very unusually solid human beings.

2194
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:22,980
When you come back from that and deal
with people like,

2195
01:31:22,981 --> 01:31:24,010
oh,
I'm a fucking cell phone,

2196
01:31:24,011 --> 01:31:25,230
such a piece of shit,
you know,

2197
01:31:25,231 --> 01:31:25,850
like,
oh my God,

2198
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:27,120
this traffic.
Oh my God.

2199
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:30,390
Like that.
Is that one of the hardest transitions,

2200
01:31:30,391 --> 01:31:33,540
like the modern first world problems,
gripes,

2201
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:35,970
the bullshit that people whine and bitch
about?

2202
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:37,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

2203
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:42,250
That was part of the discomfort I had
when I came back from my rack

2204
01:31:42,801 --> 01:31:44,690
specifically,
um,

2205
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:45,560
was,
you know,

2206
01:31:45,561 --> 01:31:49,160
the delay and flights and just how
pissed businessman Bob gets,

2207
01:31:49,161 --> 01:31:49,994
you know,
like,

2208
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:53,840
come on dude,
I let like Louis C k you know,

2209
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:54,780
that,
that,

2210
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:56,660
you know,
you're not fucking walk in,

2211
01:31:56,661 --> 01:31:59,380
you know,
like 13 of your dead when you that,

2212
01:31:59,381 --> 01:32:00,100
you know.

2213
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:00,731
No,
I'm just,

2214
01:32:00,731 --> 01:32:03,160
I've been on a gratitude tour since I
got back.

2215
01:32:03,161 --> 01:32:08,161
Like I'm just grateful for everything.
I'm so grateful that I was born by like

2216
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:12,190
random stroke of luck,
you know,

2217
01:32:12,191 --> 01:32:13,630
in Roanoke,
Virginia with,

2218
01:32:13,631 --> 01:32:17,470
with good parents and a good family
structure and was given all the

2219
01:32:17,471 --> 01:32:21,970
opportunities that I was given and I
wasn't born and Mozal and hardened in a,

2220
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,270
you know,
a seller from the most evil dudes on the

2221
01:32:25,271 --> 01:32:26,051
planet.
Yeah.

2222
01:32:26,051 --> 01:32:26,884
I mean it's just,
uh,

2223
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:27,700
it's,
it's quite,

2224
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:32,470
so I've come back and instead of getting
mad at those people are frustrated with

2225
01:32:32,471 --> 01:32:35,770
those people.
I just try and smile through it and just

2226
01:32:35,771 --> 01:32:36,790
think,
you know,

2227
01:32:36,791 --> 01:32:38,020
to myself like,
man,

2228
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:42,460
I've wished you could taste what I
tasted just not,

2229
01:32:42,461 --> 01:32:43,930
not long ago.
You know,

2230
01:32:43,931 --> 01:32:46,930
like,
it really recalibrated me.

2231
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:48,630
Um,
where it's,

2232
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,940
it just doesn't,
you know,

2233
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:51,970
I just let it teflon off,
you know,

2234
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,020
to a certain extent.

2235
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:56,530
And with regards to the people that I
work with,

2236
01:32:56,531 --> 01:32:57,890
I tend to,
I think,

2237
01:32:57,910 --> 01:33:00,550
gravitate towards people who,
um,

2238
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:05,170
like these chaotic sort of environments.
Um,

2239
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:08,440
and I got turned on to this,
uh,

2240
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:09,400
this thing,
it was this,

2241
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:13,000
this concept is acronym.
The American Military Academy kicked off

2242
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:14,480
a few decades.
It goes,

2243
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:18,400
I think 30 years ago or something.
And then they started referring to

2244
01:33:18,401 --> 01:33:22,810
working in these Vuca environment,
volatile,

2245
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:23,920
uncertain,
chaotic,

2246
01:33:23,921 --> 01:33:28,921
ambiguous environment and how we operate
in those environments and how true

2247
01:33:29,291 --> 01:33:34,180
champions and leaders like Alex can
operate in these places and these

2248
01:33:34,181 --> 01:33:37,900
atmospheres that are just absolutely
shithouse sideways.

2249
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,660
And when things go crazy,
how do you handle,

2250
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:42,400
how do you manifest it?
You know,

2251
01:33:42,401 --> 01:33:43,870
what do you,
what are you doing?

2252
01:33:43,871 --> 01:33:48,370
Are you flipping the fuck out?
Are you withdrawing?

2253
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:49,890
You know?
And,

2254
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:52,030
and we all have different methods for
dealing,

2255
01:33:52,031 --> 01:33:54,910
but I feel like I've kind of gravitated
towards those kinds of people.

2256
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:55,721
Uh,
yeah,

2257
01:33:55,721 --> 01:33:59,050
I just got done reading Sebastian
Junger's book tribe.

2258
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:01,270
I just read it to when I got back.
Amazing.

2259
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,540
It's amazing.
It reminds you of,

2260
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:09,060
of where we are and where we've been,
and also why people do gravitate towards

2261
01:34:09,551 --> 01:34:13,660
those environments and like what it,
what they get out of it and how this

2262
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:17,380
life in these intense environments sort
of,

2263
01:34:17,381 --> 01:34:18,080
uh,
it,

2264
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:23,080
it magnifies so much of what it means to
be human and to be a part of something

2265
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:27,280
that's bigger than you.
That's the phenomenal thing.

2266
01:34:27,281 --> 01:34:28,960
And I read,
I read a younger,

2267
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:31,120
I read that book too right when I got
back.

2268
01:34:31,121 --> 01:34:35,560
So just like last month I read it and it
was a great tool for me.

2269
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,460
My,
um,

2270
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:38,560
my seal team buddy,
um,

2271
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:41,710
uh,
told me to read it when I got back and

2272
01:34:41,711 --> 01:34:45,220
it says he,
all the team guys have read it because

2273
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:46,054
of that.

2274
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:49,420
It reminds them of why,
why,

2275
01:34:49,421 --> 01:34:51,470
and then why things are a little bit,
you know,

2276
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:55,180
the threads come undone a little bit
when you're not in that tribe.

2277
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:56,200
Right?
Yeah,

2278
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:56,800
pretty much.
Yeah.

2279
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,950
And how many people live in environments
where they don't know their neighbors

2280
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:02,480
there?
There's no danger,

2281
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:05,540
there's no excitement,
there's no nothing.

2282
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:08,480
And they live this muted,
terrifying life.

2283
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:11,930
And a lot of ways it's terrifying
because there's nothing there.

2284
01:35:11,931 --> 01:35:12,711
It's empty.
It's,

2285
01:35:12,711 --> 01:35:15,290
there's a void.
And it's not how human beings are

2286
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:17,480
supposed to be.
We're supposed to be confronted by a

2287
01:35:17,481 --> 01:35:20,370
certain amount of difficulty,
supposed to be challenged right now and

2288
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:23,960
life's very insulated and uh,
and soft.

2289
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:26,750
And as a result,
we insulate further,

2290
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:30,530
I think from that.
And then we medicate to deal with the

2291
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,950
hollow feeling that you get from being
isolated and insulated.

2292
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:37,100
But then it's the quest is for earlier,
which is why people climb Everest while

2293
01:35:37,101 --> 01:35:39,530
you've climbed k two while you go to
push yourself,

2294
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:40,963
you push yourself.

2295
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:43,280
Why anybody does that?
A lot of the people push himself.

2296
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:44,420
Yeah,
yeah,

2297
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:45,111
yeah.
Well,

2298
01:35:45,111 --> 01:35:47,510
and why w why do we hunt?
Yeah,

2299
01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:49,150
why do we run?
Yeah,

2300
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,230
why did we do the things that we do?
Cause it be,

2301
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:53,920
it creates engagement for me and no I'm
not,

2302
01:35:53,921 --> 01:35:56,570
I'm not running for my life but creates
struggle.

2303
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:59,210
I did run for my life just a few months
ago,

2304
01:35:59,240 --> 01:35:59,811
you know,
and,

2305
01:35:59,811 --> 01:36:00,560
and I,
you know,

2306
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,160
I look back now and that was,
that's the fucked up thing that I think

2307
01:36:04,161 --> 01:36:06,320
so many military folks really struggle
with.

2308
01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:11,330
And that's what younger talked about in
that book was how would you find the,

2309
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,910
you know,
the environment you were in was so

2310
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:21,830
precarious and it was just so tenuous.
Like it could be wiped out in any second

2311
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,250
and yet you want to go back there.
You know,

2312
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,800
I got my,
I got an avalanche on that mountain,

2313
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,150
almost dead.

2314
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,420
It turns out I want to go back.
Why,

2315
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:32,301
why?
Like what,

2316
01:36:32,301 --> 01:36:33,800
why,
what is that,

2317
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:36,480
that,
that wiring that that makes you want,

2318
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:39,500
but you know why?
Because they want to be with their boys

2319
01:36:39,501 --> 01:36:41,000
and their gauss and like,
you know,

2320
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:43,250
in it,
in it connected feeling like,

2321
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,830
you know,
our shit is tied together.

2322
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:47,300
Why do I want to go back in the
mountains?

2323
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:51,440
It's same reason cause I want to go with
the same boys and get the same sort of,

2324
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:53,390
you know,
intense experience.

2325
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:56,630
And I think that we missed that.
I missed that.

2326
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:59,540
I really like it.
Jeff's got the thing he wanted to teach

2327
01:36:59,541 --> 01:37:00,910
his son and when we're up there in
Everest,

2328
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,830
he kept on talking about teaching his
son to serve others,

2329
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:07,220
phoebe positive or a role model and
serve others.

2330
01:37:07,310 --> 01:37:08,720
And I don't know where that comes from
him,

2331
01:37:08,721 --> 01:37:10,070
but he,
that's what he always talks about.

2332
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,330
Well,
I think it started with Eric,

2333
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:12,770
right?
Because that was the foundation of my

2334
01:37:12,771 --> 01:37:14,630
relationship with this,
with my blonde buddy.

2335
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:18,290
I was a selfish dirt bag climber in j
tree,

2336
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:19,280
you know,
and the,

2337
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:24,710
in the mid nineties and I met this blind
dude who needed an ally.

2338
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:27,920
He needed a friend,
he needed a guide and he did not just a

2339
01:37:27,921 --> 01:37:28,840
guy,
but he needed,

2340
01:37:28,841 --> 01:37:31,850
as he did a teammate and not somebody
that would,

2341
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:34,730
that he could trust,
but somebody that would eventually trust

2342
01:37:34,731 --> 01:37:36,530
him.
And that's pretty,

2343
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:41,890
Dow's pretty wild for him to ask at some
point for a sighted person to trust a

2344
01:37:43,881 --> 01:37:48,070
blind person on the side of a rock face
or the side of a mountain because you

2345
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:50,330
know,
it's hard enough with everything and you

2346
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:52,640
take away your,
your vision and you know,

2347
01:37:52,641 --> 01:37:55,370
Shit just gets amplified.
And Eric's pretty famous and he's,

2348
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,490
he's summited,
what does it,

2349
01:37:56,491 --> 01:37:57,324
what does he summited?

2350
01:37:57,450 --> 01:37:58,590
Well,
he's done the seven summit,

2351
01:37:58,591 --> 01:38:00,300
so the highest point and each of the
seven continents.

2352
01:38:00,301 --> 01:38:03,690
I was on six of them with him and he
went down to an article while I was in

2353
01:38:03,691 --> 01:38:05,220
medical school.
Uh,

2354
01:38:05,221 --> 01:38:06,210
but then,
you know,

2355
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:07,950
he's gone on to do a lot of stuff.
He's a,

2356
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:09,180
he's a bad dude,
man.

2357
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,680
He's a speaker.
I mean,

2358
01:38:10,681 --> 01:38:12,510
he's a great dude,
Eric Wimer.

2359
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:14,250
So I mean,
but to be honest with you,

2360
01:38:14,251 --> 01:38:15,630
he'll tell you,
it'd be the first to tell you that

2361
01:38:15,631 --> 01:38:18,510
kayaking in a,
in a boat by himself down the Grand

2362
01:38:18,511 --> 01:38:22,650
Canyon was way scarier than anything
he's ever done.

2363
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:24,080
Whatever.
Could you,

2364
01:38:24,081 --> 01:38:27,090
you don't know what's going on.
There's the violence and talking about

2365
01:38:27,091 --> 01:38:31,290
chaotic environment around you.
Just you carefully here,

2366
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:33,750
the dude and your ear and sometimes not
at all.

2367
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:37,800
All you can hear is this violence.
And somehow he just paddled through and

2368
01:38:37,801 --> 01:38:38,400
then,
you know,

2369
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,770
he'll get tossed and go under and have
to roll back up.

2370
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:42,150
And I,
it was,

2371
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:43,960
he tells me that,
you know,

2372
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:46,800
he had his own little version of ptsd
from that,

2373
01:38:46,801 --> 01:38:49,950
from just being freaked the fuck out and
having nightmares.

2374
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:53,100
How long was that travel?
200 and something miles on that tank.

2375
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:54,870
It was a couple of weeks.
Yeah,

2376
01:38:54,871 --> 01:38:56,520
12 days maybe.
Something like that.

2377
01:38:56,521 --> 01:38:59,730
I think it was pretty remarkable and
pretty remarkable.

2378
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:00,660
Yeah,
I can imagine.

2379
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:02,010
It's a,
yeah,

2380
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:04,590
it's a bad dude,
but yet it does.

2381
01:39:04,591 --> 01:39:06,330
Um,
it is a reoccurring theme.

2382
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:06,940
This,
uh,

2383
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:10,200
this thing where people are in these
incredibly hostile,

2384
01:39:10,201 --> 01:39:12,480
dangerous scenarios and they want to go
back,

2385
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:14,790
they'd get over it and then they want to
go back.

2386
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:15,690
Yup.
Yup.

2387
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:19,290
And the challenge,
whatever you get out of it.

2388
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:20,370
Is that him?
Yeah,

2389
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,010
that's him.
Oh,

2390
01:39:21,010 --> 01:39:22,890
there's a video of him doing it.
Oh yeah.

2391
01:39:22,891 --> 01:39:24,210
You Bet.
Was He born blind?

2392
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:27,330
So he was born with a degenerative
retina disease called written look at

2393
01:39:27,331 --> 01:39:28,050
that shit.

2394
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:30,750
Oh my God.
I mean that will swallow you bro.

2395
01:39:30,810 --> 01:39:32,160
How do you spell his last name?
Jamie.

2396
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:36,200
W.
E.

2397
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:36,200
I.
H.

2398
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:36,200
E.
N.

2399
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:36,200
M.
A.

2400
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:36,200
Y.
E.

2401
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:38,280
R.
So wine is what he does in the mountain

2402
01:39:38,281 --> 01:39:40,860
sometimes.
And then mayor of the city.

2403
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,380
Well that's an old,
that's an old woman.

2404
01:39:43,390 --> 01:39:45,270
She's got hair right there.
Wow.

2405
01:39:45,350 --> 01:39:45,901
Uh,
but yeah,

2406
01:39:45,901 --> 01:39:48,060
that's him right there pulling up the
top.

2407
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:50,430
But he's a,
he's a bad man,

2408
01:39:50,431 --> 01:39:51,570
dude.
And you know,

2409
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:54,030
everybody loves him.
Some super blonde dude,

2410
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:56,400
you know.
And I think that's why our relationship

2411
01:39:56,401 --> 01:39:59,970
is so strong is because I'm not afraid
to give him some shit and kind of

2412
01:39:59,971 --> 01:40:02,100
keeping grounded.
But behind the scenes,

2413
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:05,160
he's,
he blows me away.

2414
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:06,290
I got a lot.
Yeah.

2415
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:10,290
He's a very special human being,
a that he could figure out how to

2416
01:40:10,291 --> 01:40:13,170
balance that and figure out how to go
left and go,

2417
01:40:13,171 --> 01:40:14,100
right.
Well,

2418
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:16,770
he's an amazing athlete,
first and foremost.

2419
01:40:16,770 --> 01:40:18,150
I mean,
if he was cited,

2420
01:40:18,151 --> 01:40:20,430
he could been like a pro ball player.
You know,

2421
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:23,250
he's just got that sort of body
awareness.

2422
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:25,920
And then until he was born with a
degenerate retina disease,

2423
01:40:25,921 --> 01:40:29,220
so he was those under,
he was blind,

2424
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:32,760
legally blind,
but then his retinas unraveled and at

2425
01:40:32,761 --> 01:40:35,130
the age of 13,
it was totally lights out.

2426
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:38,670
And then his mama got killed in a car
wreck two years later.

2427
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:40,530
Um,
and so he,

2428
01:40:40,590 --> 01:40:41,460
I mean,
it was,

2429
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:44,280
it was step up.
Fortunately for him,

2430
01:40:44,281 --> 01:40:45,900
his dad,
uh,

2431
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:51,200
his was a marine fighter pilot.
Ed and Ed was not about to let his blind

2432
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:56,980
son sit back and let life go by.
So he grabbed him by the scuff of the

2433
01:40:56,981 --> 01:40:59,380
neck and took him on all these are all
these,

2434
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:00,243
you know,
uh,

2435
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:03,040
uh,
around the world as he got stationed in

2436
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:04,060
different places.
And,

2437
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:05,373
and,
uh,

2438
01:41:05,710 --> 01:41:10,390
and Eric just realize like pony up and
no time to feel and got Tom for sitting

2439
01:41:10,391 --> 01:41:12,070
around,
son get up.

2440
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:15,790
And he did and he found rock climbing
and then rock climbing turned into

2441
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:17,050
mountaineering.
And that's when we met

2442
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:21,010
23 years ago,
23,

2443
01:41:21,011 --> 01:41:23,950
four years ago now.
I think this is all very hard for some

2444
01:41:23,951 --> 01:41:26,140
people to process,
especially people that haven't

2445
01:41:26,141 --> 01:41:30,520
experienced very difficult things are
very scary things or dangerous things.

2446
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:31,540
You know,
that this,

2447
01:41:31,541 --> 01:41:36,541
that people would long to do this to be
a blind guy who's going through 270 plus

2448
01:41:37,781 --> 01:41:41,740
miles of water in a kayak.
Or to be someone who wants a summit

2449
01:41:41,741 --> 01:41:45,970
Mount Everest or to be someone who wants
to be a medic in a war zone or to be

2450
01:41:45,971 --> 01:41:48,200
Sebastian younger who was out there,
but you know,

2451
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,660
embedded,
embedded.

2452
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:50,680
Yeah.
For years,

2453
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:51,850
right.
Years.

2454
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:54,820
I,
and I think that maybe the general

2455
01:41:54,821 --> 01:41:59,110
population might look at that and feel
like maybe it's reckless or some are

2456
01:41:59,111 --> 01:42:00,660
super inspired and like,
Pan,

2457
01:42:00,661 --> 01:42:01,494
it's so great.

2458
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:02,860
And then others are like,
yeah,

2459
01:42:02,861 --> 01:42:04,030
I mean I,
I'm,

2460
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:04,990
I'm down.
Dude.

2461
01:42:04,991 --> 01:42:08,890
I'm psyched that you're out there
charging because then that sets the

2462
01:42:08,891 --> 01:42:11,630
template and what it does.
I think for a lot of people that just

2463
01:42:11,631 --> 01:42:15,820
says all that bond guy can do it well
then that means I should stop feeling

2464
01:42:15,821 --> 01:42:18,430
sorry for myself cause I'm feeling low
today.

2465
01:42:18,610 --> 01:42:21,670
There's their guarantee you there was a
lot of times when I don't feel like

2466
01:42:21,671 --> 01:42:23,920
training,
I don't really feel like going out and

2467
01:42:23,921 --> 01:42:28,921
doing something hard and then I'll think
I need to train harder to be strong

2468
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:34,240
enough that when shit goes sideways I'll
have his back.

2469
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:36,310
Yeah.
I know when you do train for something

2470
01:42:36,311 --> 01:42:38,500
like Everest,
how do you prepare for something like

2471
01:42:38,501 --> 01:42:39,490
that?
Climb.

2472
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,710
Just climb up and down,
up and down.

2473
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:44,500
Lots of weight.
Like a place like you know you go to

2474
01:42:44,501 --> 01:42:47,580
boulder or somewhere in the mountains
above it or yeah,

2475
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:50,260
like way up in the hills and like big
long days,

2476
01:42:50,590 --> 01:42:51,190
long days.

2477
01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:52,510
Like 10,
12 hour days.

2478
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:53,970
That's how he trained.
Yup.

2479
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:56,040
To how many of those you do a week?
Um,

2480
01:42:56,350 --> 01:42:59,050
you know,
I mean two or three probably like big

2481
01:42:59,051 --> 01:43:00,970
long days.
I try to,

2482
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:03,370
you know,
get broke the fuck off at least,

2483
01:43:03,371 --> 01:43:05,740
you know,
a couple of times a week where I'm like,

2484
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:06,640
oof,
okay,

2485
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:09,820
I know you can wait on your pack and
doing it the whole deal.

2486
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:13,450
Those days of carrying big heavyweight,
I've kind of stopped doing that and I

2487
01:43:13,451 --> 01:43:15,000
just go,
uh,

2488
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:16,990
because I like to feel a little bit more
free.

2489
01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:19,570
There was a time when I would put on a
big pack,

2490
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,040
um,
you know,

2491
01:43:21,041 --> 01:43:23,890
and just,
just to feel that weight on my traps and

2492
01:43:23,891 --> 01:43:26,320
just only asking if he's experiencing 45
pounds,

2493
01:43:26,321 --> 01:43:27,550
he put it,
he has a new vest.

2494
01:43:27,551 --> 01:43:29,080
He was,
he was testing out the other day.

2495
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:32,050
I saw,
I'm asking because it's crazy how 45

2496
01:43:32,051 --> 01:43:33,400
pounds,
which is not much at all.

2497
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:35,620
No,
but it's a lot when you start walking up

2498
01:43:35,621 --> 01:43:37,510
hills.
Yeah.

2499
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:40,300
You know,
some of these guys are probably carrying

2500
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:41,380
way more than that.
Right?

2501
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:43,330
Like 60 70 oh,
on Denali,

2502
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:45,640
Denali packs close to a hundred as a
guide.

2503
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:50,440
That's insane.
The clients would typically have,

2504
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:52,520
oh,
it's a hundred pound pack and a 20 to 30

2505
01:43:52,521 --> 01:43:53,900
pounds sled.
And that was,

2506
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:56,990
those were Denali days.
That's the 1213 14,000 feet.

2507
01:43:56,991 --> 01:43:58,130
That's not Bell Canyon.
That's,

2508
01:43:58,150 --> 01:44:00,050
yeah.
What are these guys built like?

2509
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:03,620
Well,
I mean the ones who are good are pretty,

2510
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:06,710
pretty narrow.
How the fuck are they carrying that much

2511
01:44:06,711 --> 01:44:08,630
weight?
I carried that much weight for years and

2512
01:44:08,631 --> 01:44:11,510
years and I mean,
I was a buck shifty back then,

2513
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:12,373
you know,
and,

2514
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,600
and we carry a hundred pounds and it
hurt,

2515
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,230
you know,
but you just remember mountaineering is

2516
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:20,360
slog.
I mean,

2517
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,310
when you really move and luck on that
kind of mountain,

2518
01:44:22,311 --> 01:44:23,120
it's a slog.

2519
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:25,670
It's really slow.
And then you've got a technical

2520
01:44:25,671 --> 01:44:27,050
training.
You best lighten your load,

2521
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,600
that's,
you're not carrying a hundred a hundred

2522
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:30,410
pounds,
then you caring,

2523
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:33,410
you know,
or light light pack light is right.

2524
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:34,580
You know,
ounces make pounds,

2525
01:44:34,581 --> 01:44:38,210
pounds make paint.
You gotta you got to feel like someone

2526
01:44:38,211 --> 01:44:39,950
carrying a hundred pounds.
You have to build up to that.

2527
01:44:39,951 --> 01:44:40,940
No.
Yeah,

2528
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:41,870
yeah,
for sure.

2529
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:45,020
There's all these weird stabilizing
muscles and your hip muscles and your

2530
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:46,820
lower back and,
oh man,

2531
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,220
I couldn't do it now.
I mean,

2532
01:44:49,221 --> 01:44:50,270
I couldn't do it.
I'm just,

2533
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:52,760
I get sore thinking about it,
but I mean,

2534
01:44:52,761 --> 01:44:56,330
this was back in my twenties when I was
doing yell back to back Denali trips and

2535
01:44:56,331 --> 01:44:57,860
he didn't know any better.
I didn't know any better.

2536
01:44:57,861 --> 01:44:58,970
And it was like,
this is fun.

2537
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,380
It was fun.
And it was cool.

2538
01:45:00,381 --> 01:45:03,410
I used to do a lot of expeditions
because I was the quintessential dirt

2539
01:45:03,411 --> 01:45:05,810
bag just so I could go eat,
you know,

2540
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,910
so I could get fed and I didn't even
care.

2541
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:09,080
I mean,
I would have done it for free on

2542
01:45:09,081 --> 01:45:11,440
expeditions just so you can get some
clues just to eat,

2543
01:45:11,441 --> 01:45:13,610
to know I was going to eat some dee dee
hydrated food.

2544
01:45:13,611 --> 01:45:15,290
Yeah.
I mean I was,

2545
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:18,030
I was the,
I was living in my van man,

2546
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:23,180
like start out being this guy
I grew up in.

2547
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,160
I was born in North Carolina,
uh,

2548
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:27,590
in the smokies and I grew up in Roanoke,
Virginia.

2549
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:31,070
Uh,
and my parents are not adventurous at

2550
01:45:31,071 --> 01:45:31,904
all.
Uh,

2551
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:35,330
but you know,
my dad and mom were both just working,

2552
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:35,960
oh,
you know,

2553
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:39,470
middle class,
hard working middle class folks.

2554
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:41,750
And I was just a restless punk,
you know,

2555
01:45:41,751 --> 01:45:44,480
I was just super restless,
getting in trouble all the time.

2556
01:45:44,481 --> 01:45:46,040
And um,
you know,

2557
01:45:46,041 --> 01:45:49,640
I got arrested several times before I
was 18 and just bad,

2558
01:45:49,641 --> 01:45:53,210
just,
just restless and dumb like most of us I

2559
01:45:53,211 --> 01:45:55,500
think.
And went to school at,

2560
01:45:55,640 --> 01:46:00,640
at Tennessee for a year and got a 1.2 my
first semester and a 0.6.

2561
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:04,300
It's possible to get a 0.6.
Wow.

2562
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:05,830
Yep.
I had a d in racket ball.

2563
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:09,610
No,
no three store.

2564
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:11,900
You just weren't paying attention?
No,

2565
01:46:11,901 --> 01:46:15,410
I was,
I was drinking brown liquor and chasing

2566
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:19,250
women and I was good at it.

2567
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:24,650
A bit of both those things.
And so I failed out and then,

2568
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:29,770
uh,
moved to Colorado in 1989 and uh,

2569
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:33,620
moved to boulder and it's just a bunch
of hippies and like I was into the

2570
01:46:33,621 --> 01:46:35,810
grateful dead and I was,
you know,

2571
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:39,770
tapping into some good fun things and
grow in my head.

2572
01:46:39,771 --> 01:46:42,590
And I fell in with a group of climbers
pretty,

2573
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:45,260
pretty quick off who are a couple of
years older than me,

2574
01:46:45,261 --> 01:46:48,650
and they basically took me under their
wing and sort of gave me this

2575
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:51,420
apprenticeship and taught me how to
knock it dead.

2576
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:52,680
Wow.
Yeah.

2577
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:54,900
Boulder's a real weird spot.
Right?

2578
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:59,550
This is like fly fishing there and
kayaking and hikers and everyone's

2579
01:46:59,551 --> 01:47:01,680
riding mountain bikes and everyone's
fit.

2580
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:04,080
It's weird because where's the fat
people?

2581
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:06,390
There's no fat people in boom.
It's so weird.

2582
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:09,660
You walk around,
everybody's got like Solomon's on and

2583
01:47:09,661 --> 01:47:11,850
shit.
Like everybody's coming in from a

2584
01:47:11,851 --> 01:47:12,730
workout.
Yeah.

2585
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:15,900
Whole foods.
Just everybody stinky and find some

2586
01:47:15,901 --> 01:47:19,380
granola.
Neural Sinewy and shit ranchers.

2587
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,420
There's a lot of people.
So I just,

2588
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:23,220
I've,
I've lived in Boulder on and off for 28

2589
01:47:23,221 --> 01:47:25,750
years.
I went to medical school in Philadelphia

2590
01:47:25,751 --> 01:47:27,690
at Drexel Medical College,
Pennsylvania.

2591
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:29,820
Other than that,
I've been in and out of boulder for 28

2592
01:47:29,821 --> 01:47:31,320
years and I,
I,

2593
01:47:31,321 --> 01:47:32,640
I'm,
we're moving to evergreen.

2594
01:47:32,740 --> 01:47:33,810
Uh,
we're moving to evergreen,

2595
01:47:33,811 --> 01:47:36,210
Colorado,
which is a super sweet spot,

2596
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:39,360
but that's the reason I'm leaving
boulders because it's just,

2597
01:47:39,361 --> 01:47:40,650
it's pretty congested,
man.

2598
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:41,573
A lot of people,

2599
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:42,613
oh,
areas.

2600
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:45,620
Lot of people live there.
And now I'm riding on the four oh five

2601
01:47:45,621 --> 01:47:47,720
here,
200,000 people.

2602
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:50,930
I don't know how y'all do it.
One of the people I was talking to

2603
01:47:50,931 --> 01:47:52,460
alumni,
she was saying that she's going to bring

2604
01:47:52,461 --> 01:47:56,120
her nieces to California.
They'd never been outside of Maui.

2605
01:47:56,690 --> 01:47:58,820
They'd been a Lanai and Maui.
That's it.

2606
01:47:58,821 --> 01:48:00,680
That's it.
So they haven't even been to fucking

2607
01:48:00,681 --> 01:48:04,610
Honolulu and now she's going to fly him
to Los Angeles.

2608
01:48:04,611 --> 01:48:08,880
They're going to go to Disneyland or
universal like what in the fuck she gave

2609
01:48:08,881 --> 01:48:10,190
him some mushroom.
See what happens.

2610
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:12,830
Just don't need to that to be
overloaded.

2611
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:17,330
I remember when I was a kid and uh,
we went from a New York too,

2612
01:48:17,331 --> 01:48:20,020
or from Boston rather than in New York
for uh,

2613
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:20,900
some,
um,

2614
01:48:20,990 --> 01:48:23,030
I think it was for a karate tournament
or something like that.

2615
01:48:23,031 --> 01:48:26,960
But we were driving up the west side
highway and you see the city looming in

2616
01:48:26,961 --> 01:48:28,910
the distance,
like the death star.

2617
01:48:29,390 --> 01:48:32,300
And I remember thinking,
what in the fuck is this?

2618
01:48:32,301 --> 01:48:34,790
Like how are there,
I'm going to so many bills.

2619
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:37,640
Boston's a city,
but it's not that kind of city.

2620
01:48:37,670 --> 01:48:38,780
It's not Manhattan.
It's,

2621
01:48:38,830 --> 01:48:39,680
yeah,
Manhattan.

2622
01:48:39,681 --> 01:48:41,860
It's something very unique and special
and it's,

2623
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:43,340
yeah,
and you pull up to it,

2624
01:48:43,341 --> 01:48:45,050
you're like,
what is this?

2625
01:48:45,051 --> 01:48:46,220
This is,
it was so fun.

2626
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,090
Intimidated.
Well that could go either way for those

2627
01:48:48,091 --> 01:48:48,860
kids,
right there.

2628
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:53,860
Can't just be fascinated by the energy
or bug the fuck out and you know,

2629
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,420
can't wait to get back to them.
And all this amount of stimuli that you

2630
01:48:57,421 --> 01:49:00,180
get in an environment like that,
it's just overwhelming.

2631
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,210
But you're like,
boulders too much.

2632
01:49:02,211 --> 01:49:05,820
It's too much.
Too many people now there's almost a

2633
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:07,440
hundred thousand,
well do this any longer.

2634
01:49:07,441 --> 01:49:09,990
I don't like to sit in my truck.
I like to move,

2635
01:49:09,991 --> 01:49:11,850
you know,
if I'm going to go drive somewhere,

2636
01:49:11,851 --> 01:49:15,210
I want to drive there and park,
get out and go in and do my deal and

2637
01:49:15,211 --> 01:49:16,320
come back.
And then,

2638
01:49:16,321 --> 01:49:17,820
you know,
the trails are pretty,

2639
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:21,960
pretty populated to you go climbing,
you've got to wait in line.

2640
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:25,470
Um,
and sometimes you gotta go up like,

2641
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:30,030
like roped climbing when people are
going up sides either getting their

2642
01:49:30,031 --> 01:49:32,790
stuff at dawn really can get up.
Yeah.

2643
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:35,550
That's a lot of people getting busy out
in the woods,

2644
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:38,040
which is cool.
But you know,

2645
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:39,960
I'm just feeling like,
you know,

2646
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:41,240
it was a lot of,
a lot of folks,

2647
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:44,690
it turns out the older I get,
the less people he wants to talk to you

2648
01:49:44,691 --> 01:49:45,150
soon.

2649
01:49:45,150 --> 01:49:46,370
I think also that's,
you know,

2650
01:49:46,371 --> 01:49:51,371
you're involved these intense situations
like being in Iraq or like being on ever

2651
01:49:51,461 --> 01:49:53,050
since.
Sometimes you just want to sit back and

2652
01:49:53,051 --> 01:49:54,360
process it all.
Yeah.

2653
01:49:54,450 --> 01:49:56,620
It would sit on the rocking chair and I
liked to,

2654
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:58,300
you know,
I want to mow my yard.

2655
01:49:58,301 --> 01:50:00,830
I would,
or I want to drive my tractor around and

2656
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:03,130
sip on a beer.
I'm a,

2657
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:06,520
I'm a southern boy at heart and I like
quiet things.

2658
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:09,400
I know a bunch of guys who've moved out
there for that very reason.

2659
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:11,110
Yeah.
It makes sense.

2660
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:13,150
And uh,
so we're moving there here in a couple

2661
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:13,770
of weeks.
That's awesome.

2662
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:15,640
The in the landscape couldn't be
prettier.

2663
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:17,350
It's nice.
Beautiful.

2664
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:20,260
It's real nice how the winters are
brutal.

2665
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:22,520
They ain't gold hill winters though.
No,

2666
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:23,583
no.
That's,

2667
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:25,630
that's way worse.
But it's brutal,

2668
01:50:25,710 --> 01:50:26,380
you know.
No,

2669
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:27,270
it's real.
You gotta read.

2670
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:28,300
You gotta get ready.
Yeah,

2671
01:50:28,301 --> 01:50:30,130
we live on,
we live on a dirt road.

2672
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:32,320
Holla out there.
Huh?

2673
01:50:32,350 --> 01:50:34,510
I pulled up the Joe's house.
There's an old power wagon,

2674
01:50:34,511 --> 01:50:37,510
his old house in Boulder and old power
wagon with a snow plow and there's a

2675
01:50:37,511 --> 01:50:39,760
couple of snow machines down there and
I'm pulling my,

2676
01:50:40,350 --> 01:50:42,100
do you know why those things are there
joe?

2677
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:45,720
Cause you've got to pour yourself out.
No Snowman.

2678
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:47,320
I,
when I lived in Boston,

2679
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:51,310
I drove a van.
I drove a delivered newspapers.

2680
01:50:51,610 --> 01:50:56,020
I drove 365 days a year.
So I drove every fucking day.

2681
01:50:56,050 --> 01:50:58,390
Every time a blizzard hit,
every time snow hit,

2682
01:50:58,810 --> 01:51:00,940
I'm not scarce now.
I know how to drive in snow.

2683
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,640
I mean it's not fun to get stuck and you
will get stuck,

2684
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:06,340
but it doesn't bother me.
It doesn't freak me out.

2685
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:08,710
But to someone who's never been in snow,
yeah,

2686
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:10,270
it ain't the place to play.

2687
01:51:10,450 --> 01:51:12,610
But if you had to choose between,
like it's,

2688
01:51:12,611 --> 01:51:14,500
you know,
it's a tough call because like would you

2689
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:19,350
rather live in like Phoenix right now?
I heard it's 124 degrees that they're

2690
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:23,050
canceling flights because it's so hot
that canceling flights.

2691
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:23,913
Yeah.
You know,

2692
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:29,110
I mean I don't do something about that
cold and snow too.

2693
01:51:29,111 --> 01:51:31,990
That's like really peaceful.
Like there's something that people don't

2694
01:51:31,991 --> 01:51:33,280
like.
I remember when I was a kid,

2695
01:51:33,550 --> 01:51:36,580
one of the things that I really liked
about snow is a special,

2696
01:51:36,581 --> 01:51:39,460
when I had to deliver newspapers,
it's like I would have to be out there

2697
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:44,760
and you would hear nothing because the
snow muffles all the sound.

2698
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:48,160
So it's like you get a kind of peace and
quiet that you don't,

2699
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:49,750
no one's driving cause it's,
you know,

2700
01:51:49,751 --> 01:51:52,510
there's two feet of snow.
So you were out there and it's just

2701
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:56,730
nothing,
nothing and everything soft and you hit

2702
01:51:56,731 --> 01:51:57,850
it,
watch,

2703
01:51:57,970 --> 01:52:00,160
watch for of your feet on the ground and
that's it.

2704
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:02,200
You know,
it's like you,

2705
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:06,880
and then I think people that live in
those environments like live in the

2706
01:52:06,881 --> 01:52:10,210
cold,
you'll appreciate summer for real.

2707
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:13,430
Like you really appreciate summer out
here every day.

2708
01:52:13,431 --> 01:52:15,370
Summer,
nobody gives a shit.

2709
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:19,320
It's 75 degrees perfect in January,
you know,

2710
01:52:19,690 --> 01:52:21,880
and you go into boulder and on the cu
campus,

2711
01:52:21,881 --> 01:52:24,940
you know,
like you get a 60 degree,

2712
01:52:24,941 --> 01:52:27,330
50 degree day in the spring,
you know,

2713
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:29,200
get you to just go down to their daisy
dukes.

2714
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:30,280
Whoa.
You know,

2715
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:34,860
like they're like,
he needs to put up those feathers that's

2716
01:52:34,861 --> 01:52:36,100
sent fly.
Well,

2717
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:38,950
yeah.
Wow.

2718
01:52:39,070 --> 01:52:40,240
So what's next for you,
man?

2719
01:52:40,241 --> 01:52:42,940
What are you going to do now?
We're going to figure it out between now

2720
01:52:42,941 --> 01:52:45,190
and next spring cause springs when I
start getting the Itch,

2721
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:46,200
uh,

2722
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:49,340
you don't have to go do something.
And so how do you guys work it out?

2723
01:52:49,341 --> 01:52:51,680
Do you like come to him with an idea or
does he,

2724
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:53,960
do you guys sit down and talk about it?
Well,

2725
01:52:53,961 --> 01:52:55,990
we can't talk about it or can't talk
about financial.

2726
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:57,770
Well,
he just pitched something to me

2727
01:52:57,771 --> 01:53:02,720
yesterday that's pretty interesting and
adventurous and fun and curious and a

2728
01:53:02,721 --> 01:53:06,530
mystery to that of a Jeff Good tv.
I mean,

2729
01:53:06,531 --> 01:53:09,170
he's a good person in general,
but he's also really good tv.

2730
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:12,230
We have a mystery.
Two guys have already died trying to do

2731
01:53:12,231 --> 01:53:13,460
it.
Oh Jesus.

2732
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:16,183
Check,
check.

2733
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:17,990
Yes.
And it's pretty dangerous.

2734
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:21,320
And I want to put a team together and
Jeff leading the team and see if we can

2735
01:53:21,321 --> 01:53:22,970
go pull it off.
Oh my God,

2736
01:53:22,971 --> 01:53:25,070
Dude.
Well listen,

2737
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:27,480
don't die.
And uh,

2738
01:53:27,570 --> 01:53:30,080
come back when you live and we'll talk
about it.

2739
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,850
Come back when I live.
Yes.

2740
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:34,040
I like that idea.
It's fun living.

2741
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:35,450
It turns out,
oh yeah,

2742
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:38,780
I enjoy life.
And do you enjoy it more when you come

2743
01:53:38,781 --> 01:53:39,614
back?
Yeah.

2744
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:40,820
Yeah.
Once again,

2745
01:53:40,821 --> 01:53:42,200
like gratitude to her.
Like,

2746
01:53:42,290 --> 01:53:43,790
you know,
like I love it all.

2747
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:48,880
I don't want my kids a total slob and
like really drop shit and makes mess

2748
01:53:49,041 --> 01:53:49,874
everywhere.
And I'm like,

2749
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:52,100
I love that boy.
You know,

2750
01:53:52,101 --> 01:53:54,800
like you're a little fuck up.
And I just love you.

2751
01:53:55,150 --> 01:53:57,230
Remember what you were like.
Exactly.

2752
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:58,190
Yeah.
Boy.

2753
01:53:58,250 --> 01:53:59,360
I mean it's,
it's,

2754
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:02,480
that's the universe saying,
what's up bitch?

2755
01:54:02,510 --> 01:54:03,590
Yeah.
Here you go.

2756
01:54:04,490 --> 01:54:07,520
What are you going to do with this kid?
You gotta take him to Everest.

2757
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:09,770
Uh,
he's a little long haired kid that's

2758
01:54:09,771 --> 01:54:11,810
just trying to find his way and I can
relate,

2759
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,910
you know,
he's trying to figure it out.

2760
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:15,740
No one just knows their way.

2761
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:18,350
There is no everyone find their way.
No,

2762
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:19,910
you have to.
I'm still looking,

2763
01:54:19,911 --> 01:54:21,410
man.
And you always will be.

2764
01:54:21,430 --> 01:54:22,610
Yeah.
And that's the good thing.

2765
01:54:22,611 --> 01:54:24,980
I think that's part of what I'm doing
while I'm doing it.

2766
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:26,900
I'm still looking a hundred percent,
you know,

2767
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:30,890
I'm still trying to figure it out and
I'm trying to do the best I can help and

2768
01:54:30,891 --> 01:54:32,870
people where I can,
I don't have,

2769
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:38,410
I don't have a wide array of skills,
but I know how to help people when

2770
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:41,810
they're having a hard go.
That's a great path though.

2771
01:54:41,811 --> 01:54:43,130
I mean,
the path of service,

2772
01:54:43,131 --> 01:54:45,760
the path of helping people and the
gratitude and the,

2773
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:48,360
the experience that you get from that,
that's,

2774
01:54:48,370 --> 01:54:50,060
that's very positive.
Yeah.

2775
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:51,493
Yeah.
I mean,

2776
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:55,130
I feel like if I can instill any of that
in my boy,

2777
01:54:55,190 --> 01:54:56,660
like I win,
you know,

2778
01:54:56,661 --> 01:54:58,670
it's be,
be grateful,

2779
01:54:58,870 --> 01:54:59,600
like,
yeah.

2780
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,280
Live,
live a grateful life.

2781
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:03,200
And,
and by living that,

2782
01:55:03,201 --> 01:55:04,250
what does that mean?
It's like,

2783
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:05,570
you know,
pay it forward,

2784
01:55:05,571 --> 01:55:07,280
show gratitude,
show love,

2785
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:09,740
show compassion,
um,

2786
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:12,530
and,
and allow people to,

2787
01:55:12,910 --> 01:55:16,370
to be the best version of them and do
the boats you can to make them better.

2788
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:18,680
You know?
Well said and I didn't know.

2789
01:55:18,710 --> 01:55:20,120
I didn't know that until I met Eric,
you know,

2790
01:55:20,140 --> 01:55:21,680
honest with you,
he was a catalyst for all that.

2791
01:55:21,890 --> 01:55:24,920
Wow.
That's amazing that one person can

2792
01:55:24,921 --> 01:55:29,120
change the course of your life that much
just by existing and being around them,

2793
01:55:29,121 --> 01:55:32,870
experiencing how they navigate life.
Yeah.

2794
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:34,880
That's how I learn.
Well listen man,

2795
01:55:34,910 --> 01:55:36,540
thanks for doing this.
Really appreciate it.

2796
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:40,010
Thanks for bringing them on.
We'll do it again back when you guys

2797
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:42,050
survive cause you're going to survive.
Right.

2798
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:43,970
Okay.
We'll do it again.

2799
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,930
We'll do it again and we'll talk about
it.

2800
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:46,933
All right.
That was fun,

2801
01:55:46,970 --> 01:55:48,260
Bro.
Thank you.

2802
01:55:48,350 --> 01:55:49,130
Joe.
Ya.
