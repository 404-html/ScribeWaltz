1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,833
Hmm.

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,483
Hey everybody,

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,730
this episode of Joe Rogan experience is
brought to you by stamps.com stamps.com

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,420
is a service that we, we know
very well because, uh, in fact,

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,950
Brian uses it. Tom Segura and
Christina Palicki use it. Uh,

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,980
many people we know have used stamps.com
to send things through the mail where

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,640
you would ordinarily have
to go to the post office,

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,290
get your shit weighed out, get, you know,

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,520
paid different prices for different
things. So they have to like,

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,970
they have to measure everything and
figure out how much you owe them.

11
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:45,250
And you have to wait in line behind a
bunch of other people that are doing the

12
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:49,540
same thing. You could do all that stuff
at home naked. You don't have to be there.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,790
You don't have to be looking
at the screen. You know,

14
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,210
you could make funny faces
when you put the things on it.

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,070
You can be really rude to yourself.
You can do whatever you want.

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,910
And with stamps.com they allow you to
do this in the privacy of your own home

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,620
and save money.
You can print u s postal stamps,

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,700
actual real postage on your home computer.
It's amazing.

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,230
It's super easy to do.

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,380
And if you go to the old timey microphone
in the upper right hand corner of

21
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:17,770

You don't have to do anything else,

25
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:31,390
you don't have to go to the post office,
you print everything at home.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,530
The postman comes like he normally does.

27
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:36,010
Do you hand them the
packages and you're done.

28
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,320
It cuts many steps out of the process.
It's a beautiful thing. And again,

29

is the leading source of audio
entertainment on the Internet and a,

35
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,330
uh, a website that I've been using
for a long time. They're amazing.

36
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:17,950
They have so many different titles
over 150,000 other titles. They have,

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,790
you know, audio books and
podcasts and stand up comedy.

38
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,030
And if you go to audible.com
forward slash Joe,

39
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,210
you will get one free audio book
and 30 free days of audible service.

40
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,900
Amazing books, amazing
comedy content. It's just,

41
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,140
it's really just a fantastic resource
for getting shit online that a,

42
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,950
you would ordinarily have to read
yourself. You know, reading is fun,

43
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,530
but sometimes you want to hear other
people read. Great for driving to work to,

44
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:50,680
if you have a, you know, if
you're in traffic you're just,

45
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:53,560
might as well read a book while you're
in traffic and they're a cool company and

46
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:53,800
they've,

47
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,070
they've supported standup comedy for
a long time and I just think they're

48
00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:01,750
fantastic. And also if you have
the, if you use the kindle HD fire,

49
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:05,470
they have this amazing new technology
called whisper sync and what whisper sync

50
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,010
is,
it works on both your,

51
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,670
your kindle and it also works with audible
and it picks up where you leave off.

52
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:16,620
And what that means is you could
buy the book and read it like a,

53
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:19,500
if you're sitting in bed at night
and then when you go to bed he, it,

54
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,380
it marks down where you are.
You get in the car and the, the,

55
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:28,360
the podcast or rather the audio version
of that book will pick up exactly where

56
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:32,440
you left off reading. It's
amazing. It's such a cool idea.

57
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,680
So you read and then when you're
done reading, you shut it off.

58
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,000
You get in your car and the actor reading
the shit picks up where you left off.

59
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,840
This is a beautiful world we live in.
I'm so happy about it.

60
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,950
I'm so happy about all this fucking cool
technology that's happening and things

61
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,701
like this.

62
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:52,960
Whisper sync is just a perfect example
of someone just figuring out how to make

63
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,780
this even cooler.

76
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,070
we're going to get to the bottom of
some things. Phil knows Wallace's

77
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,170
the Joe Rogan experience.

78
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Hey,
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

79
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,470
So the young man and targets you
right now filled dimmers. Um, he,

80
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,100
I heard about you on Twitter,
on the Internet.

81
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,860
People were contacting me about your,
uh,

82
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,660
your situation where you, um,
you're an animal trainer, right?

83
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,530
I Wa I was an animal or an animal trainer.
Why don't you tell us your story,

84
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,850
tell us what,

85
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:19,320
what got you to this point of controversy
or that could take a while. Like how,

86
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,700
where do you want to delve
wherever it's interesting shit. Uh,

87
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,940
well off the hop, let's just talk about
how I became an animal trainer. Okay.

88
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,400
I'm 22 years old,

89
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,110
actually went to school for
a broadcast engineering. Um,

90
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,790
you know, I want, I had aspirations of
recording bands and touring with bands,

91
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:43,290
whatever it be, uh, as any confused
22 year old punk boy would be.

92
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,070
And then sure as Shit one day at my
dad and I were cruising around and he's

93
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:50,940
given me the old, you got to
get a job son. I'm like, Shit,

94
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,190
because I paid a lot of
money from education,

95
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,070
which ultimately became a free
download about six months later.

96
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,020
Like we're talking 2000, right. So and uh,

97
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:05,030
saw an article in the paper you want to
be a marine mammal trainers assistant.

98
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,990
And I thought that's,
that sounds like a great job.

99
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,020
I can scrub buckets or do whatever it
is to the people who are training these

100
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,410
animals, but I didn't think
I could get the job. Um,

101
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,120
applied for the Gig and uh, you
know, what size boots do you wear?

102
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,530
Boom nine got this job. And I wasn't,
you know, getting that marine mammals,

103
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:30,560
trainers, assistant job wasn't, you
know, you're going to go scrub buckets,

104
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:33,860
everything. I mean there were obviously
that it encompassed all of that,

105
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:38,030
but I sort of training animals really
quickly. Like right off the hop,

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,811
right off the hop.

107
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:41,690
They're teaching you how to do it and
they're teaching her how to do it.

108
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:45,440
You know. Now is there a science to
train these things or is there, there's,

109
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:49,820
they're like,
like nice methods or more cruel methods.

110
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,900
Cause I've heard of some of the masses
that you use to train orchids as kind of

111
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:55,100
disturbing,
you know,

112
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:58,610
they lock them in pens together and get
them really tightly grouped up where

113
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:01,400
they can't do anything and they don't
feed them unless they do their tricks.

114
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,960
Yeah. That that exists in just about
every application of animal training,

115
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:09,560
but that's not the perspective that you
exercise or that they train you when

116
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:12,270
they train you to train animals.
It's about positive reinforcement.

117
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:16,220
So if an animal does something that's
a desired behavior for instance,

118
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,850
you reward them for that in that there's
the subtle nuances of if they're not

119
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:27,140
doing what it is you're asking, you
don't reward them. So that's where,

120
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,310
that's where the, you know, the, and then
there's negative punishment. I mean there,

121
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,290
there is all of that, all of that
existed in training historically.

122
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:37,820
But trainers now and the art of
training of training animals,

123
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,170
it's more positive reinforcement based.
So you learn all of that off the hop.

124
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:45,320
But at the end of the day there's one,
there's one variable and that's fish.

125
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,200
So it's either reinforcement
or ultimately deprivation.

126
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,010
And it was all things that you
learn and are effective tools.

127
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,780
So you need both. You should
train like a, an aura,

128
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,910
an Orca,
you develop a relationship with the orcas,

129
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,290
the orcas learn really quickly,

130
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,850
I want to do this because I'm
being reinforced for doing. So.

131
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,750
It's a simple as that. That's,
so you sort of run with that,

132
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:14,510
you develop that language. There
becomes a, an understanding between,

133
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,150
especially over the years as you
grow this, this relationship,

134
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,390
the animals know and the animals,
the animals I work with every one of them.

135
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:24,140
I'd never met a single animal that I
wasn't incredibly like good natured,

136
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,770
just really good and
really wanted to please.

137
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,600
So it's not very difficult
to train an Orca,

138
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:32,330
especially when applying
the positive reinforcement.

139
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,420
So if that's the case and how
does it happen that you, you,

140
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:40,421
you hear stories about like these animals
being corralled up in small cages with

141
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:45,530
or small pens with a bunch of them like
stuck right next to each other and how

142
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:48,770
they deprive them of food for punishment.
Like is that bullshit? No, no,

143
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:50,990
that's absolutely not bullshit.
That's a, how does that happen?

144
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,600
I think what we're talking about is
something that happened a lot like a long

145
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:58,460
time ago. Rather it is what does system
amalgamated or turned into, you know, the,

146
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:01,340
the more of the positive reinforcement
aspect. But when you look at that, you're,

147
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,520
you're trying to suggest the negative
reinforcement aspect of it where hey

148
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,010
you're, you're being bad, so I'm
going to shove you over here.

149
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,300
This would be more of a circumstance
where you can't positively reinforce an

150
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,600
animal for doing something because they're
not doing anything that is desired by

151
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:19,560
design of the positive reinforcement
technique. So whatever's going on here,

152
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,060
you're avoiding inadvertently by avoiding,
you're not rewarding,

153
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,390
you're not feeding your withholding food.

154
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,600
So this is a lot of talk
and hold on a second.

155
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:32,940
This is a lot of talk to try
to answer one simple question.

156
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,630
Why did they put them in a pen like
squished all next to each other?

157
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:39,390
I'm really confused.
While in what situation would they be?

158
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:42,150
I mean they had at any fun. So are
you saying they don't do that anymore?

159
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,510
That's because what I've
read about them treating,

160
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:48,480
like one of the big things that people
were complaining about was that they

161
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:52,620
would pack all these animals into these
pens and put them next to each other in

162
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:55,770
these tanks and they really had no room
to move and they want it biting each

163
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:57,510
other sometimes. Oh, tiny tanks.

164
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:02,250
I mean all facilities have different
sized tanks or options to mix or divide

165
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,050
animals or whatever.
So,

166
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,160
and that they would deprive them of food
if you are depriving the animal of food,

167
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,940
that would work in the sense that if you
had animals in one environment and you

168
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:14,400
want them to go in another, a place
where the animal didn't want to go,

169
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,940
you can't reinforce that animal if
it's not going through that gate.

170
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,360
So the idea is you're going to try to
coax that animal through positive sort of

171
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:23,160
short, short steps. You know these,

172
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:27,150
these approximations and you reinforce
each approximation. Eventually they go in,

173
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,900
you're reinforcing them, you're giving
them that reward for going through,

174
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:33,600
but if they're not going through, you
can't reinforce him. So it's actually,

175
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:34,980
it's deprivation in that sense.

176
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,450
What does it feel like to train
something that you know is probably

177
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:43,860
misunderstood and really smart
like a killer whale or an Orca?

178
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,330
They're probably pretty misunderstood by
most people, don't you think? Absolutely.

179
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:53,230
100% there are super intelligent
creatures, right? Like it's hard to it.

180
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,563
I don't like to,

181
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,990
it's hard to call them an animal just
because you know there's definition,

182
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,920
whatever that is of animal and there's
a stark contrast between humans and

183
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:05,040
animals in whatever it is.
Whatever that definition is.

184
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,860
When it comes to [inaudible]
and intelligent beings,

185
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,500
there's no contrast between humans and,

186
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,790
and I want to say animals
as a whole because they have
best interests. They have,

187
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,470
you know,
they have objectives.

188
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,070
I'm not sure that there is conscious
of those objectives. Maybe they are.

189
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,720
How do we know?

190
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,070
Well we know about brain size and we
know about how much activity's going on.

191
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:28,500
And I see, I see what you're saying to
a certain extent about some animals,

192
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:32,850
but looking at rats eyes and tell me
he's like thinking about poetry. Okay.

193
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,120
Maybe his looking at dolphins
eyes and there's a big difference.

194
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,810
There's a big difference between making
eye contact with the marine mammal.

195
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,230
There's something weird about them.
They're very smart. They're very smart.

196
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,010
They're very smart in a weird way. Like
where it's like what's going on in there?

197
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:49,680
Like that seems like almost
like a person in a weird outfit.

198
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,160
Spiritual way for sure.
Is that the most fucked up aspect

199
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,040
about places where they
have them in tanks?

200
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,160
Cause it seems to me that that's
like we're going to watch slavery,

201
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,620
we're going to watch slavery
of an animal that we don't,

202
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,540
we don't understand what they're saying.

203
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,430
So we think it's okay
to just lock them up.

204
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,460
That's a perspective that
your capable of exercising.

205
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,400
But when people are sitting there in
front of their TV and they watch that

206
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:14,020
jingle come on or whatever and you know,

207
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:17,260
seaworld jingle where I led a candidate
jingle, hey, that's fun. They go there,

208
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:19,510
they blocked out a lot of the things.
They paid a lot of money to be there.

209
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,250
They're there to be entertained,
that there to be happy.

210
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:23,440
They shut their brains off
to a lot of things. You know,

211
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:26,710
maybe there's an inclination for a
second that's messed up right there,

212
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,450
but I think that they,
at the end of the day,

213
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:31,630
they're looking to be entertained and
they get that music and the splish splash.

214
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,270
You got wet. Hey, I'm happy. I'm
going home. Happy my kids happy.

215
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,020
We'll do something weird about
wanting animals to do our bidding.

216
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,750
There's something weird
about those dog shows.

217
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,840
Those dog shows aren't just
about how cute your dog is.

218
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,130
Those dog shows us about your dog being
just on fucking point listening to you

219
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,510
every step of the way.

220
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,780
Being completely trained stopped
when you stopped prancing.

221
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:55,120
When you tell it to prance,
all that stupid shit.

222
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:58,300
That doesn't mean anything like bears
bouncing a fucking ball on the tip of

223
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:00,250
their nose.
That doesn't mean anything either,

224
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,310
but if you can get me a band that can
ride a bike and bounce a ball up on his

225
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:03,670
head,

226
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,610
I'm going to make you a millionaire is
a bunch of assholes out there that want

227
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:10,680
to see this stupid fucking bear, do some
shit that any normal person can do. It's,

228
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,150
it's weird, right? It's an affinity for,

229
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,780
for almost for that dominance to assert
your dominance on something and people

230
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:19,420
do it to humans every single day as
well. But certainly with animals, when,

231
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,860
I mean animals don't speak English,

232
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,720
I don't speak any other
language for that matter,

233
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:25,960
but they do speak their own and
they can't express to us like, Hey,

234
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:28,270
like maybe let me Outta here.
Well,

235
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:32,800
they're speaking the language and
that's something that is really hard for

236
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:33,700
people to understand.

237
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:38,410
There's a difference between some sounds
that animals make that would indicate

238
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:43,240
that there's some sort of communication
going on and a pure language. Dolphins,

239
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,710
whales, Orcas, they have
a language like this.

240
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:51,711
It's not as small as a few grunts and
it's so complex and weird and it's so

241
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:56,690
sound based, we can't
even decipher it. We,

242
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,580
we have ideas that they're saying
the same thing, but there's dialects.

243
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,020
They're from different areas where they
do it like it's so complex that it's

244
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:09,340
like our human language just we don't
understand it and we can't crack it.

245
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,980
So because of that,
because we can't hear their screams,

246
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,140
we just put them in these fucking tanks.

247
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,810
It's really dark because we don't consider
them to be intelligent because they

248
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:23,560
can't manipulate things with their
fingers because they can't build housing.

249
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,400
Let's just walk out. They can't
walk out. They can't get out there,

250
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,820
but in their world and the world of
the ocean, you don't need thumbs.

251
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:32,230
He don't need any of that.
In fact,

252
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,940
we would be like terribly designed for
the ocean if we were forced to become

253
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:41,680
marine animals and things would change
radically and quickly. All right.

254
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,620
The placement of our air hole
is a fucking stupid place.

255
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,150
The way your mouth works, a stupid, you
can't really close it. Good can be fat.

256
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,160
He can't be fat. Can't be lazy.
You can't be lazy. You got to move

257
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,910
24 hours a day. You barely, you don't
even really sleep right. Well they,

258
00:14:54,911 --> 00:14:56,480
they sleep while they're in motion.

259
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,170
You almost wonder if just the
pure instinct to survive and,

260
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:06,270
and maybe limiting oneself language or
species language isn't more genius than

261
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:07,880
having such an elaborate language.

262
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:10,790
Cause you almost wonder if we don't
communicate as effectively as we could

263
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,310
because we know too many
damn words. Like, you know,

264
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:16,730
how much language is expressed and how,
how you see each other and how we,

265
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:17,480
you know,

266
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,900
well then all the things that we've
invented that we have to name and then the

267
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:23,690
interaction of those things
in places that we've invented,

268
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:27,230
like cities and airplanes and cars,
all those things that we've invented.

269
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:31,190
I'll take on a whole new school
of vocabulary on their own. Yeah.

270
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:35,900
It's fucking ridiculous. John Lennon said
like, imagine a world with no borders,

271
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:36,480
no nothing.

272
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,060
And I think he's imagining the land of
the Orca is really know what they say

273
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,870
Lando, but essentially he's
envisioning an ocean. Yeah.

274
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:45,440
But he also married Yoko Ono. That's,
it was a silly bitch. You know,

275
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:48,230
a lot of people are big John Lennon fans.
They don't want to miss that.

276
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:49,330
But come on son,

277
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,770
you got to look at everything that
guy says with a grain of salt.

278
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,740
I showed my girlfriend like a
video of Yoko Ono. She's like,

279
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,000
I didn't even know Yoko Ono does that.
The whole like all this screaming.

280
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,530
She's like, oh, what's this amount?
That's Yoko Ono. Strange. Um, yeah,

281
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:08,330
that's not good. But the sound
of Orcas is probably, you know,

282
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,550
for a lot of people it sounds like Yoko
ono underwater. It's pretty easy go.

283
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,430
Ironically. You know, it's kind of does
maybe John Lennon was, was onto something.

284
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,880
He was, I think he just, he had a weakness
there. It was. We all have weakness. Yeah.

285
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,600
Um,
so like,

286
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,920
do you think that there's gonna come a
point in time where they will be able to

287
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:31,010
solve and doll decipher dolphin language
and realize like what you're doing is

288
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,410
imprisoning humans?
They're there.

289
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:37,640
It's essentially just as bad as if
we found a group of blue people.

290
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,330
They were people, but they
were blue. Put them in a cage.

291
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,680
We couldn't understand a word they said.
They would talk like dolphins, like

292
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,420
make crazy noises that we couldn't
decipher but clearly talking to each other

293
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,170
and we just decided to put them in blue
people world. You'd be rich quick. Yeah,

294
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:52,610
I mean we would do that.

295
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,390
Of course that would be a little harder
to sell because they look closer to us

296
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,590
because of fingers and shit.

297
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,100
But if you could just realize that a
dolphin is probably just like the Ma,

298
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,900
the mind of a person
or maybe even weirder,

299
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,840
maybe even more intense and a lot
of ways this cerebral, emotional,

300
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,910
more emotional. They're the basis of
their language and their and their being.

301
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,110
They're just so such a social animal
and they have such like long and deep

302
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,010
social structure, social
dynamics, family bonds,

303
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:26,640
so deep that at the end of
the day it's like these guys,

304
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,540
you almost have to wonder if they're more
by far more intelligent and more like

305
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,750
sympathetic than we are because that's
where we lack is were were dicks.

306
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:34,880
They're not dicks.

307
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,810
One of the interesting things is that
dolphins don't really kill people except

308
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:41,900
for in captivity. And I've read
something online, somebody wrote,

309
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:43,190
but it turned out to be total bullshit.

310
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:47,480
But it was kind of funny that a guy said
that dolphins used to kill people up

311
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:50,040
until World War II because
in World War II, the fighter

312
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,210
pilots started using, not dolphins,
but orcas started using a Orca as,

313
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,610
as target practice. And the
orcas realize, all right,

314
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:57,970
we'd better not fuck with people.
They got the under.

315
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,010
So word got out and now they don't kill
people anymore. It sounds hilarious. Uh,

316
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,760
but it turned out to be bullshit.
But it's fascinating. If it was true,

317
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,230
but they're that smart did, the point
is like they actually could do that.

318
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,300
If they found out that
people were shooting people,

319
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:15,060
they would probably tell each other.
They'd be like, hey man, you hear that?

320
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,750
That sounds,

321
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,220
eh,

322
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,580
dive, go under the, um, I mean, it's,

323
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,760
the relationship that we have with them
is very bizarre and we're going to be

324
00:18:25,761 --> 00:18:28,340
incredibly embarrassed if we find
out what they're actually saying.

325
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,310
One day we realize what we've done.

326
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,760
All these people go into slave world.
You're going to slave world,

327
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,500
you're going to watch slaves do flips.

328
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,530
I've been privy to like probably some
messages that I know would be beating the

329
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:46,670
shit out of me even more than the shit
kicking I've already taken since having

330
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,470
left that Gig. So yeah.
What do you mean? Well,

331
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:54,590
the idea that if you're listening to it,
if we decipher what the dolphins sang,

332
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,800
I mean I've had to do some,
I've,

333
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,370
I've had to do some things
with dolphins like you know,

334
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,440
let's speak hypothetically just for a
second. Okay. On my lawyer's advice.

335
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,190
So let's assume that a green dolphin
comes in and let's call it an elderly

336
00:19:07,191 --> 00:19:09,290
dolphin.
A real old male dolphin comes in,

337
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,860
so he's just been captured via Jospin
capture, just been captured, who knows,

338
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:16,610
a month before he was out in the wild his
whole life, his whole life and old man,

339
00:19:16,611 --> 00:19:21,440
wise, old man comes in with a group of
about six, seven others, mostly young,

340
00:19:21,441 --> 00:19:23,000
really aesthetically pleasing animals.

341
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,770
And this one just is not prepared
to stomach the life of captivity.

342
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,660
And so what do you resort to? You
start force feeding them, right.

343
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:37,190
So again, just hypothetically dropping a
pool, the water's down to nothing. Again.

344
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Shit, ton of dolphins green
so they're not trained. They,

345
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,420
they're swimming around that crazy
and you're having to go down there,

346
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,790
grab a towel wrapped around its rostrum
which is the end of their nose there.

347
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:51,140
That face, open it up and start cramming
like frozen fish in there. Oh my God.

348
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:54,080
What message do you think that Dolphin
was probably trying to tell me?

349
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,480
So imagine if I could like,
I just imagine a point like,

350
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,510
just to go back to what you said
about decipher the language,

351
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,700
I can't imagine what I'd be processing,
you know, if like if they were,

352
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,310
if they were able to communicate on a,

353
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,830
a language to language
understanding with humans. Yeah.

354
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,910
That's dark shit and be tough.
Yeah. Now that's part of your life.

355
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,190
I mean that was part of my life, but
that's like everybody does it. If you're,

356
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:19,670
if you're,

357
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,980
if you're a trainer like that is
something that you're going to have to do

358
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,790
something that's not even the worst of
days. That's just part of your life.

359
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,890
You like part of your
life is he'd take a towel,

360
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:29,330
you wrapping around the dolphins face,

361
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:32,660
you open it up and you stuff frozen
fish in there. Try to keep my life,

362
00:20:32,661 --> 00:20:36,680
start injecting them right in the back
injections and no one ever says, hey,

363
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,190
maybe we should let this guy go. Well,
when you're in Niagara Falls, Canada,

364
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:43,190
there's really nowhere that
you can let them go. I mean,

365
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:45,110
I'm not really specific animals.

366
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,580
The animals we brought in
were from the Black Sea.

367
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,510
Where's the Black Sea in Russia? Russia's
where there's a lot of trade in Russia.

368
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:53,470
I mean they've as we speak,

369
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:56,470
have some wild caught or cause that they
caught in the last like month or two

370
00:20:56,471 --> 00:21:00,220
and they're two of the two of which in
fact are being sent to soap or to Moscow

371
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,690
to be on display during the Sochi
Olympics. Wow. Fuck. Wild caught. Yeah.

372
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,940
Horrible mood and that. Those are slaves.
Those are slaves. They really are.

373
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:14,350
They're slaves that will do tricks that
have to do tricks if they want to live.

374
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:16,630
I mean, I don't want to say if
they want to live, but yeah,

375
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:19,810
that's what it boils down to. You're,
you're tapping into their survival mode.

376
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,920
You read this thing about workers that
their cerebral cortex is 40% larger than

377
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:28,680
a human beings. Like that's something's
going on in there. You know what,

378
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,020
whether it's what we like to think of
his consciousness or whether it's some

379
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:36,010
sort of an alternate state that they
only can appreciate because they live

380
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:37,510
underwater,
but whatever it is,

381
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:42,511
there's talent once and it seems really
fucking cruel and shortsighted that we

382
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:47,410
locked them up. There's a scene in black
fish where you see a group of boat,

383
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:51,970
a pot of about five orcas, six orchids.
They're hunting a seal and in it,

384
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:54,940
this woman named Lori Marino
who's a neuroscientist,

385
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,210
she's saying it's
conceivable or what we've,

386
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:03,190
what we've come to learn is that they're
able to exercise a mind as as one.

387
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,780
It's a singular consciousness between
the group it and in the scene,

388
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,400
the seals sitting on a,
on a little ice flow,

389
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:15,401
a little tiny ice pad that orcas come in
all five and simultaneously a boom like

390
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:17,560
this dunk,

391
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:21,190
this side of the iceberg and then the
other and then the wave sort of goes over

392
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,030
and they shoot the seal over and then
you're talking some serious intelligence

393
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:28,720
when you start talking
collective conscious and as
a, as a singular conscious,

394
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,630
now you're talking.
So that's some deep shit right there.

395
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,600
They plan that out in a way that a
lot of people would never figure out

396
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,280
simultaneously as one. And it, it appears
as though one is leading the show,

397
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:42,040
the restaurant's system shut down
and they're just going in as a,

398
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,680
as like an army of one. It's, yeah,

399
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:46,630
and they're communicating
while they're doing this,

400
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:50,350
they're organizing this and communicating
it that they understand that I had to

401
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:51,184
shut it off,
man.

402
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,280
I had to shut it off as soon as they
were talking about their dorsal fins

403
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:58,060
collapsing because they don't use them
because they're not out there fucking

404
00:22:58,061 --> 00:23:00,670
using them in swimming. And
they're just upright. So I mean,

405
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,270
all that weight of that cartilage
is just going to, over time,

406
00:23:03,271 --> 00:23:07,210
it's going to peel that sucker. Right?
Fucked up. I used to scratch candy.

407
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:10,090
We had a big male, uh, this,
this was a massive animal,

408
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,810
smaller than Tillikum the one
that's profiled in black face,

409
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:15,820
but I used to scratch
rate underneath that,

410
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,050
that sort of curvature and just peel
off the dead skin farm and he be just

411
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:22,480
shaking like, yeah man,
I'd be hitting it hard,

412
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:27,070
pulling out like a handful of dead
skin. Wow. Pretty Rhonda there. Wow,

413
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:30,040
that's crazy.
But how would they normally get that?

414
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,990
Would they rub it off on rocks?
So they wouldn't have,

415
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,640
they wouldn't accumulate that
dead skin. I mean, they're,

416
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,950
they're constantly swimming, constantly
moving. So the weight of the water,

417
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:38,710
the pressure that water would keep
that dorsal fin nice and erect. Right.

418
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,070
It's because they're all that surface
resting. There's nowhere for them to swim.

419
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:43,530
And I mean, there's not, the
pools are never deepened.

420
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:45,350
I think it doesn't properly
accommodate them. So,

421
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,760
and the people that work in these
facilities, how would, how do they,

422
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,980
how do they rationalize this?
How do they,

423
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,480
the first thing that needs to be stressed
as these are not bad people, people,

424
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,440
these are people that go
into these situations,

425
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,490
assuming that this is not only like a
socially acceptable thing, this isn't us,

426
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,630
this isn't just accept that
this is encouraged and, and,
and celebrate it. I mean,

427
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:10,260
seaworld was celebrated by the
masses, if you will, up until the law,

428
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,160
the release of blackfish prior to that,
they control the message.

429
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,100
So people see that and they're just
like, oh my God, that's amazing.

430
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:19,820
That's beautiful and amazing.
So when you're a 22 year old punk boy kid,

431
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,060
you're thinking, Hey, I want to, I want
to go get a gig doing that. That's,

432
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,710
that's the cat's ass job right there.

433
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,550
You get the Gig and now you're working
for someone while you're 22 years old,

434
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,970
you need a paycheck and your parents
had been pounding you down for your

435
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:36,680
lifetime that you could got to go up there
and you don't get a good job and work

436
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:38,750
as hard as you can and everything else.
So you're,

437
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:43,930
you're working for someone who owns this
facility and you believe you're doing

438
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:47,330
what's, what's your, what's in
the best interest of the animals.

439
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,020
You're there to care for the animals.
So you don't see the, the shitty part.

440
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:53,570
You don't think, wow, I'm doing
this. I never put the animal there,

441
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:57,650
the animals there. It's not just there,
it's, it's great that it's there.

442
00:24:57,651 --> 00:24:59,690
People love that it's there.
This is a,

443
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:03,650
this is a job that people like
really want to get, get the Gig,

444
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,280
trying to do the right thing so it's not,
it's not bad people.

445
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:10,340
So then the rationalizing doesn't come
until you there for a really long time

446
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,770
when you have to really
start rationalizing some of
the decisions that are made.

447
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:14,630
Once you get closer to the upper echelon,

448
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:16,690
closer to the brass and you see
the decisions that are being made,

449
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:19,160
you're like Jesus,
but shouldn't we be doing this instead?

450
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,520
That's when you start questioning shit
and I guess it takes a really good person

451
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,480
at that point or the better part of the
people cause we never managed to keep

452
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:29,060
people at our facility there. I mean we
were going through a lot of good people.

453
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:30,860
That door was revolving in and out.

454
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,920
Do you think that as part of
that is like being disenchanted?

455
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,050
Part of it is like
realizing what you're doing.

456
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,050
Part of it is if you're
there for the right reasons,

457
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:42,170
you really give a shit about those animals
and it beats the shit out of you that

458
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:45,020
the decisions that are being made and
you're the muscle of that decision,

459
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:48,170
this isn't being made. You're the muscle
to execute it. You're just like, whoa,

460
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,880
wait a second.
We don't have to do that.

461
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,130
Like that we have to do
is making the decisions.

462
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,500
Well in my experience we don't have to
say names. Just like, well, I mean I was,

463
00:25:57,501 --> 00:26:01,550
I worked for a facility
that was micromanaged by one
man who's been, who's been,

464
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,730
who's owned it now for 52 years.
Oh, see who owns it? He owns it.

465
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,650
He owns the slave plantation.

466
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,810
I can't say that I hit a launch a lot at
1.2 $5 million suit against me if I say

467
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:12,644
that.
So you're going to,

468
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,900
you said that I'm going to
get a lawsuit for saying that.

469
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:16,640
I think I should have
brought you a disclaimer.

470
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,030
Like I don't think I should
get sued for saying it's labor.

471
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,140
I think you should have to
prove that it's not. Well,

472
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,800
if you're a super intelligent animals
locked up in swimming pools, uh,

473
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:26,510
what are you doing?
If you've got the slavery,

474
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,670
if you've got the money to see
this process through the court,

475
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,860
then you can then impose that on him.

476
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:35,570
But if you don't have the money to defend
and you're like me getting attacked,

477
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,050
um, so the, so it's basically
one person's decisions and,

478
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:42,440
and then all the people that
really care about the animals are,

479
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,020
but he owns the joint. He has all the
cash he pays you, which gets you the beer,

480
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,510
the food. But he makes the decisions.
And does he make decisions?

481
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:53,580
Like does he have a
background in marine biology?

482
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:57,930
Like does he make educated decisions or
these financial decisions or like how to,

483
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,250
how to like the crueler aspects
of the job manifest itself.

484
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,380
But the problem with, I say
the problem, but with me it's,

485
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,690
I worked at a very unique
place that they're very few
facilities where it's like

486
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,810
one guy who owns it,
who's been doing this as long as you have.

487
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,970
It's hard to rationalize
his decision making.

488
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,850
I'm going to put a big asterisk next
to his name. Maybe other people,

489
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:18,780
I don't know.
But at the end of the day,

490
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:22,590
that's obviously there's a financial
aspect of the decision making. Um,

491
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,563
but

492
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,180
that story about that dolphin
open up his mouth and forced me.

493
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,600
That's the stuff of nightmares we
have to treat harbor seals like that.

494
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:36,390
I just think of what it must
be like to be that animal,

495
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,130
to be sucked out of your world at an
elderly age and stuffed into this tank

496
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:44,610
where you know you're never getting out.
We're like, there's no escape hatch.

497
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,370
You're not going to double o seven you
way out of this and fucking figure out

498
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:51,150
how to unjam me the door and make your
way down the dock and jumping in the

499
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:53,460
water and swim to freedom.
Especially in Niagara Falls. Man,

500
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:55,420
you're pretty landlocked
aside from some freshwater,

501
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,820
but dolphins are going to last long
there. Yeah. I try to rationalize it now.

502
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,420
It really was only until after I left.
When I quit my job, I come out in,

503
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:06,720
the first thing I did was I started
petitioning the Ontario government.

504
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:10,290
We need rules and regulations so that
these animals can live at least in an

505
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:13,050
environment that that is
more accommodating to them.

506
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,710
I wanted more greater animal
protection laws. This is, this was the,

507
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,950
this was the avenue I went because still
I was still disillusioned to the fact

508
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:20,870
that, hey, wait a second.

509
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:24,870
If you delve deeper to the day one of
them landing in the pool or being in that

510
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:27,210
in your possession,
there's a history there.

511
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,670
Go back there and see what's
what's happened there.

512
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,290
And suddenly the more I think about that,

513
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,090
that's when you start taking
the real shit kicking.

514
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:37,080
Cause you're like Holy Holy Shit.
Like this animal's been through a lot.

515
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,530
It's been through fricking lot
protecting it in captivity.

516
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,420
That's not really serving this animal a
lot of like you're not doing this animal

517
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:48,210
a big service like you need.
You need to abolish this all together.

518
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:51,150
So I would say the campaign has changed,
especially with blackfish coming up.

519
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:54,870
Cause people know now like this. It's
not, not only not fun, it's just not fun.

520
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,130
It's just disgustingly cruel. Like that's
a whole lifetime of shit for an animal.

521
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:00,840
That's again,
if you,

522
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,440
if you could relate to it instead
of separate yourself from it,

523
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,410
stop looking at it as an object.
Be that animal for a second.

524
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,960
Now try to be that animal for
a lot longer than a second.

525
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:14,040
You all of a sudden you start feeling
like pretty bad and wonder why we would

526
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:17,670
expect compassion from
aliens. You know? I mean,

527
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:22,200
think about what we can do to some of
the most obvious intelligent animals on

528
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:25,170
our planet that were different from,
well guess what?

529
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,800
The idea is something coming from another
fucking planet that has fingers and

530
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:31,590
eyes and a nose in front of its
face and looks just like you.

531
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,750
That's a fucking stretch.
More.

532
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:37,590
Most likely it's going to be just as
bizarre to you as an Orca is to you.

533
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,930
And so if you look at
the way we treat orchids,

534
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,000
why the fuck would we ever
expect anybody to be nice to us?

535
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,630
I used to exercise the analogy of um,

536
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,320
of aliens with the younger trainers
all the time. I'd say, look,

537
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,030
we're aliens to these animals.

538
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:56,380
You need to make this animal's
environment as comfortable as possible.

539
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,550
Bearing in mind always we are
aliens. Just, you know what I mean?

540
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,340
That's part of relating to the animals,
which is they're thinking like that.

541
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:07,060
You're just like, wait a second.
Like I got it to start being nicer.

542
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:09,940
Because if an alien comes down, I
don't want that. I don't want to be,

543
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,810
it's a stupid thing to say like it's one
of those who your talking about aliens

544
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:18,640
gun people like automatically go goofy
with it. But the reality is it's actually,

545
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,290
it's the right analogy because we really
are aliens in their world and we're

546
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,900
obviously supposedly intelligent.

547
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,080
We're obviously intelligent enough
to figure out how to get them when

548
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:32,170
intelligent enough to how to figure out
how to train them, put them in tents.

549
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,600
We can put them in tanks rather have
all these people come to see him.

550
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:36,970
We're obviously intelligent,
have to film them theirs.

551
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:40,720
They can tell there's a lot of shit
going on that they don't do but they've

552
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:44,380
gotta be like, God you guys are dicks.
Like why are you holding onto me?

553
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,290
Like we don't hold onto it. We don't,
we don't, we don't, we don't do that.

554
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:50,110
I think we killed things
but we don't hold onto them.

555
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,770
I think that's when the frustration
level start boiling for these animals.

556
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:55,780
Cause when they're first there, when they
first arrived, he was a green animal.

557
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,210
If there,
I mean the bottom line is,

558
00:30:58,211 --> 00:31:00,670
it depends if they're a good
candidate for captivity,

559
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:04,600
but they learned real fast that,
okay, that's the hand that feeds me.

560
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,080
Like I wanna I wanna I want to develop
this relationship, if you will,

561
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:11,740
which is the relationship of like
abiding by this person's rules, right?

562
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,040
Then again,
goodwill,

563
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:16,520
the animals and the other ones that
are just like the same for me. There,

564
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,960
they're there, they're cutting out and
there's nothing you can do. I mean,

565
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,350
you pull blood from them, you check that
blood. There's nothing wrong with them.

566
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:26,560
This animal's not sick. Why isn't
it eating? And then days later,

567
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,710
why is this animal debt did
not want to be in captivity.

568
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,550
They just starved themselves to death.
I've seen it so many times, wow.

569
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,170
The will to live loss.
And you're like,

570
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,160
that was always the most
frustrating thing for me.

571
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,560
And you're gonna make me fucking cry.

572
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,010
Every time I ever watched
an animal lose its will.

573
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,840
That was the most that that destroyed me,
that destroyed me. It's like, it's over.

574
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,870
The will is gone. You're not going
to find a cause of death here.

575
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,940
They just stopped eating style.

576
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:57,520
How does the the main guy deal with all
this? How does the guy owns these joints?

577
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,380
Let's hypothetically,
okay,

578
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:01,690
let's not even talk about
any one person in particular,

579
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,620
but there's a bunch of these things
out there. There's the, there's these,

580
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,760
these seaworld type places all over
the world, right? Like I said, Marina,

581
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,290
animal places,
whatever you want to call them.

582
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,050
The most difficult thing you
can try to do is rationalize.

583
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,680
Especially in in my particular experience
is the decision making that's going on

584
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:21,100
at there. You just can't. Anything that
you think is a good idea is a bad one.

585
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,010
Do you come and direct communication
with the people that own the place?

586
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,900
I did eventually.
Of course I was there 12 years,

587
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:29,980
so I mean I was by all
means up there and the,

588
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,340
have you ever been there when
these ideas are expressed?

589
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,760
Have you ever been in front of like any
people that own these places and say,

590
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,220
hey, you know what we're doing is
really fucked up. I don't have a job

591
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,220
no more because it was the slamming of
the fist that was going on when these

592
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:46,520
decisions were being made.

593
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:49,940
That ultimately led to me being
like the slamming of the fist.

594
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:52,740
What do you mean that decision's
being made? You got to do this. Okay,

595
00:32:52,741 --> 00:32:56,720
so this is what we do. This is how we
train them. Get Out of my office. Say No,

596
00:32:56,721 --> 00:33:00,950
lose your job.
I was that.

597
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,300
I was the asshole who was going to get
fired real soon. It's a children's movie.

598
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,600
It's like a movie. Yeah. It's
like, you know what I mean?

599
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:12,520
It's like some Whoville type
shit where you know you, you,

600
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,390
you see this evil thing being perpetrated
by someone who's just in it for money

601
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:20,420
and not thinking about the
humanity of the whole thing.

602
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,620
It's funny you mentioned that we,

603
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,830
we had a Christmas show we were
putting together and these,

604
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,050
there's these brothers that do these
animated shorts and Canada, you know,

605
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:29,600
they're, they're pretty
well known. Anyways,

606
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,290
they had produced this video and
they gave it to us and you know,

607
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,910
the colleagues were like,
yeah,

608
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:37,910
this should be great to show it during
the Christmas show. Okay. Put it in.

609
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:43,030
The cartoon was of this old man who went
and stole a wild baby walrus from its

610
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:45,650
mother and you don't want to know exactly
how those that gets done. Of course,

611
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:47,930
the, the cartoons, you know, less graphic,

612
00:33:47,931 --> 00:33:50,020
but then he grabs a
polar bear and his ideas,

613
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,690
he's going to have these two
things dual and, and fight it out.

614
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:57,680
Then basically the Mont, the mother
Walrus comes back and the, and the mother,

615
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,100
a polar bear and they, you
know, they get the bad guy,

616
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:05,150
but we showed that video
during a Christmas show. I'm
watching this going, shit.

617
00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:09,200
That reminds me of someone.
Hypothetically, hypothetically.

618
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,540
It's, it's very, it's very sad that
we don't have laws stopping this.

619
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,750
I think that's what this fights a boat.
I mean that's what, that's the stink.

620
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:21,050
I started along a while back. I think
there's something about the zoo too.

621
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:24,350
I wrote a piece a long time ago about
the zoo, about it being animal prison.

622
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,520
I eat a pot cooking and went to the
zoo once. Eddie Bravo, my friend Eddie,

623
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:32,450
he ate five grams of mushrooms allegedly
and went to the zoo once and he said it

624
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:36,350
was the most depressing thing he's ever
seen his life. He said it was so sad,

625
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:41,300
like the reality of what the zoo is just
was in escapable, the sadness of it all.

626
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:44,960
He had to get out of there and I felt
like that after I eat a pot cookies,

627
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,870
I eat a pod cookie and I went
to the zoo and I sat there. I,

628
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:51,890
there's a bench across from the chimpanzee
and closure at the La Zoo and I sat

629
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,960
for like a half hour,

630
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:58,070
40 minutes just staring at this one
chimp just trying to think about what his

631
00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:01,090
life is like, what is where, where the,

632
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,320
the the wonder of the natural,

633
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:08,420
the natural world living in the jungle,
living off the land,

634
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:12,050
doing what they've done for fucking
a million years or whatever.

635
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,800
The chimpanzees have been around that
the freedom and laughter and the,

636
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,400
they would want around fucking each
other and grabbing bananas and Shit.

637
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:22,850
I mean they live like ultimately in
almost an Adam and eve type paradise.

638
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,870
It's utopia man. It is with chimpanzees.
It's for Utopia. I mean, yeah,

639
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:29,020
there's dangerous. Sure. This jaguars,

640
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,560
they can suddenly start protecting animals
from other animals. But not only that,

641
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,020
we have that same problem.
There's a fucking mountain line.

642
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:38,010
They just photographed the Hollywood hills

643
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,380
this week. Jesus Christ.
It's, that's a call. Call it,

644
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,540
they caught it at one point in
time. Yeah, we're cute. We caught,

645
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,440
we catch fucking giant monsters
and we release them. We were like,

646
00:35:47,441 --> 00:35:51,750
be free monster. We're in your
neighborhood and we respect that.

647
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,400
You have to wonder like it took,

648
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,490
it took your buddy like five grams or
shrooms and you had one of your pot cakes

649
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,100
to,

650
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,990
to be able to exercise that perspective
of sort of like liberating yourself from

651
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:04,140
all the bullshit, like the
flashing lights, the neon
disasters, everything else.

652
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,110
And I think that's why people rationalize,

653
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:08,850
cause they're always a nun
data with everything so much
that they can't just for

654
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:12,720
a second sit down and stare at that
animal's eyes just for a second.

655
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,740
And if it scares you,

656
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,320
don't turn away because the
first thing people that are just,

657
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,220
first thing I'll do is I
just, I just exercise too much
attention. Then it's also,

658
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:24,220
there's, there's the issue of it being
there already and when it's their running,

659
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:28,290
it's sanctioned and you see adults
walking back and forth pushing strollers,

660
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,690
it seems like it's okay.
And I look,

661
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,720
I'm a hypocrite because I take my
kids to the zoo, they love the zoo.

662
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,970
Then they're young and they,

663
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:38,460
they enjoy looking at animals and it's
fascinating to be there live and see a

664
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:43,410
giraffe like whoa. And to feed the
Giraffe, I get it. You know, I get it,

665
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,120
but it's, it's probably better
if we didn't have it. It's,

666
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,350
it seems like a fucked up thing. And this
is coming from a deer hunter. You know,

667
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,780
I'd like hunting animals.
I like eating animals.

668
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:56,490
I've been a mediator my whole life.
But I don't think you should lock them up.

669
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:01,200
I think they should be free. I
think the wild animals, you know,

670
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:03,220
there they are.
There's some,

671
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:07,350
there's something magical and special
about seeing something in the wild,

672
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,500
something that's moving
around living its life.

673
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,670
There's something inherently sad about
seeing something we took from the wild

674
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,380
and then made it live in a city.

675
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,470
It doesn't replicate that experience
in any capacity. What's it now?

676
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,230
Is it not replicated?
Like we don't give a fuck.

677
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,400
We're just saying we don't care what we,
I know what you like, but getting there.

678
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,470
I want to say we used to
not give a fuck though.

679
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,590
Do you think people were more aware now?
I don't doubt that for a second.

680
00:37:32,591 --> 00:37:34,560
If there's a physical huge paradigm shift,

681
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:37,680
like people are not interested in
seeing that no more with everything.

682
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:40,200
I think a lot of things,
I think with life itself,

683
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:45,000
I think what we're experiencing now
because of the Internet is a reality that

684
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:48,030
never existed before. A way of
communicating that we're never existing,

685
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,510
that it never existed before. And I
think the amount that it's changing us,

686
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:55,530
it's happening so rapidly and it's
so deep that we have a hard time

687
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:57,210
understanding what's really going on.

688
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,080
I think we're in the middle of a
hurricane of information and it's changing

689
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:04,320
every single aspect. It's changing
things for the good and for the bad.

690
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,530
It's changing things in weird ways.
It's uh,

691
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,910
there's a lot of confirmation
bias because of it.

692
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:12,960
A lot of people are grouping up on online
find likeminded morons who believe the

693
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:15,990
earth is hollow and that there's fucking
a certain group of people that live in

694
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:16,471
the middle of it.

695
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:19,140
You could find a message board with those
people will believe you and they'll,

696
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:23,340
they'll go with you.
There's just this weird aspects to this,

697
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,580
but that it's select the
inevitable aberrations and
this fucking rolling tsunami

698
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,480
of of ones and Zeros and information
that's coming our way. I think on a whole,

699
00:38:33,481 --> 00:38:36,280
the larger like demographic of people,

700
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,190
you know, not, not the,
not the tiny pockets,

701
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:42,850
but there's probably some
relativity between the tiny
pockets and the masses are

702
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:45,220
pretty sick of it. Like
you know, I don't know.

703
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:47,140
Like I think they think
about it for the most part.

704
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:48,210
That's what I was going to say is like,

705
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,190
because it's there because
the zoos are already there.

706
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:52,900
You don't think about it cause
sea world's already there.

707
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:55,940
You don't think about it. It's their
adults are running it. See, hey, hi.

708
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,670
How are you?
I'm assuming there's rules.

709
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,950
You assume there's rules and
there's regulations and like,

710
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:01,750
oh they must be doing
something right because look,

711
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:04,570
it's being celebrated like Holy Shit
like that. That looks kind of small,

712
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:06,250
but they must know something we don't.

713
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:09,460
So it must be perfectly calm down
to sea world guy, the director,

714
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:11,380
he's so friendly.
He's waving at everybody.

715
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:13,630
He wouldn't be mean to the
dolphins to get him to jump.

716
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,090
While you're not mean to the dolphin
though, this is the difficult,

717
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,160
like this is the thing. When
you're, when you're there,

718
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:20,530
you don't think you're being mean.
You're being mean by plucking a moat.

719
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,510
That's really fucking mean.

720
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,620
But asking them to do the jump
and training them to do the jump.

721
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:29,370
You don't exercise that perspective
that you're being mean. So I,

722
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,260
I worked with a lot of the
seaworld breasts that are
in black fish and you know,

723
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:35,200
it isn't until after you see what the,
what they're saying in court,

724
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:38,530
some of the things they're doing
you just like, that guy was awesome.

725
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:40,900
He was a nice guy, man.
Like that guy's a dick.

726
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,180
What kind of things in
Cordy talking about well,

727
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:47,500
lies of course lies
allegedly lies or let's say,

728
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:49,570
let's pretend these people
that aren't even real people,

729
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,550
there are two tranches that are on trial.
Um,

730
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:56,200
what are they guilty of and what are they
claiming? Well, there's your Angeles.

731
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,880
I mean,
even people at the end of the day,

732
00:39:57,881 --> 00:40:00,670
they're trying to keep
their business very viable,

733
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,060
keep the rules out the trenches,
have an aunt business they run,

734
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,820
they train aunts and they get
these ants to do flips. Well,

735
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,530
they pay people very
little money to train them.

736
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,210
They pay people very little money.

737
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:13,930
They convinced those people who are
legitimately good and animal caring.

738
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,430
You know,
people that care for animals that are,

739
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:17,560
they're going to convince them that
what they're doing, it's good. Pay Them.

740
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:21,170
Very little put, you know, there's
a system of oppression. There were,

741
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,960
like I said before, this, that hammer,
that fist comes down and you're,

742
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:28,840
now you're the muscle. Like the idea
is here, you don't like the idea,

743
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:33,010
but you're the muscle to execute it or
these profitable businesses. Oh Shit.

744
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,790
I thought if you knew what I was up
against in Niagara Falls and I can fall,

745
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:36,700
it's not a big place.

746
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,650
If you knew what I was up
against in Niagara Falls to
be like, is it profitable?

747
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,560
Like is it, did they yield
a lot of influence? Um,

748
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,980
at every level of government and
everything else? Yeah, maybe. What did,

749
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,540
what did you do that you got
in trouble for? What happened?

750
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:54,040
So I quit my job and I didn't get
in trouble for that. Why'd you quit?

751
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,490
Couldn't do it. You couldn't do it
anymore. You just hit a breaking point.

752
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,550
I hit a breaking point long before I quit.

753
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,460
And so the quitting was like a mist.

754
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:08,530
What was like the craziness after you
go beyond that threshold of a breaking

755
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:13,220
point. So yeah, I got out. So before
you quit you are making stink,

756
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,280
stink big stinks.
What were you doing?

757
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,500
I was trying to keep from keep
what was going on from happen,

758
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,120
from continuing.
I was trying to stop,

759
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:24,790
I was trying to fix an
otherwise really big problem,

760
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,650
like a glaringly evident that
problem that everyone is seeing.

761
00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:32,110
Like we got a big problem here.
Who's going to,

762
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,930
who's going to fight to change this?
You start looking around and

763
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,660
yeah, that's not happening. This
avenue is not exercising it.

764
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:45,480
This one pretends to be ready
to exercise something, but

765
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,010
yeah.

766
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:47,841
So then you got it.

767
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:51,840
You just say it's very difficult for you
to communicate this because of the fact

768
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:54,570
that you have a lawsuit going on. So
you're dancing around stuff a little bit.

769
00:41:54,571 --> 00:41:57,600
I got a dance a little bit. Yeah.
When? Once the trailer? Yeah. Yeah.

770
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:59,050
Let's watch a trailer.
Okay. Hold on one sec.

771
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,730
Okay.

772
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,990
What does the trailer for explaining
blackfish official trailer

773
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,220
shit

774
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:12,150
the fuck out. When you look into their
eyes, he knows somebody gets home.

775
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:19,450
An animal that possesses great
spiritual power not to be metal. Yes.

776
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,600
Bye County sheriff's office.

777
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,100
We need to reform for the world.

778
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,103
Yeah,

779
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,143
a whale

780
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,300
telecom.
How is the one that went after her

781
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,850
and dawn is the senior trainer
here at Shampoos Stadium.

782
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,910
She captured what it means
to be a sea world trainer.

783
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,330
That it made me realize what happened to
her. Really could've happened to anyone.

784
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,630
I've been expecting somebody
to be killed by telecom.

785
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,420
We weren't told much about
it other than it was trainer.

786
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,010
It didn't just happen. It's
not a thing. Killer adventure.

787
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:09,590
You have to go back to understand this
speed.

788
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:14,040
Boats and heard of the man and make
could just pick out the young ones.

789
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:18,450
This was the worst thing.
Oh.

790
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,210
When Tillikum arrived at seaworld,

791
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,680
he was twice as large as the next
animal meat store. These whales,

792
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,240
you don't want to call a module which
was 20 feet across and 30 feet deep and

793
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:31,100
the lights were all term.
No,

794
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,430
probably led to what I
think is a psychosis.

795
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:44,400
Oh Wales captivity, all psychologically
traumatized. It's not just telecom.

796
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,980
If you were in a bathtub for 25 years,

797
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,960
don't you think you'd
get a little psychotic?

798
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,640
Dawn would tell you that it was
her mistake they blamed for,

799
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:00,060
that's just a bold face lies. I was
just instructed to get rid of it. Dang

800
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,090
street has a vested interest in spinning
things that sells a lot of sham dolls.

801
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,620
It sells a lot of tickets.
Set the gate.

802
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:12,320
There was no record of the
Norco doing any harm. Wow.

803
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:19,880
You should just watch that.

804
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:23,450
They should play that for the
judge and the judge who go, stop.

805
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:27,260
This fucking case is over. This thing's
not going to cart. It's a slap suit.

806
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,650
It's a strategic lawsuit against public
participation. He wants me broke.

807
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:35,550
He wants me to not be able to get
through this judicial process,

808
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:37,830
which right off the hop
is really expensive,

809
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,900
but when you see something
like black fish come out,

810
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:43,290
that's got to support your
cause tremendously. Uh,

811
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,500
I like to think I'm an
a can't lose situation.

812
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,360
Like this thing has been building the
craziest momentum off the hop. It was,

813
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:55,800
I mean, that's a scary endeavor.
Doing what we did, being where we are.

814
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:59,640
That's scary shit. What does that mean?
Doing what we did? What did you do?

815
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:05,160
A newspaper called? They found
out the Walrus guy quit his job.

816
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,640
They want to know why you were
the Walrus trainer, the Walrus,

817
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,880
the walrus trainer among other things,
among other things.

818
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:17,340
They want to know why you pick up that
phone and you're amidst the scariest,

819
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:21,240
the scarier parts of depression
and you're not touching that.

820
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:23,760
You're not touching that. I got,
I got things to process like, um,

821
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,230
I'm not touching that.
And then a situation,

822
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:33,231
a scenario unfolds where suddenly you
realize you have to touch that someone has

823
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:37,410
to,
and so you pick up the phone.

824
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:38,790
Okay.

825
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,870
And then 14 other people for that matter,
wind up picking up the phone.

826
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:46,970
As you know, these stories start
to, as this investigation continues,

827
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,520
okay.

828
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,790
The decision I made different than
than other people, for instance,

829
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,990
and I can understand and appreciate
why they had their reasons I do.

830
00:45:56,991 --> 00:46:01,430
Mine is to not use your face and image.
I said,

831
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:05,390
go ahead. It's, it's filled
Merce, it's filled. Immerse.

832
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:09,380
Who's talking to this newspaper right
now? Go ahead. Something has to be done.

833
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:14,960
Newspaper prints. Front
page, shit gets crazy.

834
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,340
It doesn't just last for a day or two. And
what was the allegations? What did you,

835
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:23,330
what did you accuse him of or what was
the, what was the big revelation? Well,

836
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,070
okay.

837
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:29,130
The facility that I worked at,
animals were suffering.

838
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:30,610
Okay.

839
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:33,790
Simple as that. Simple as
suffering. Just basic reality.

840
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,960
The reality of those facilities.
Every animal suffers in those places.

841
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,710
They suffer from a lack of freedom.
Yes. Right? Yes. This one, there's an,

842
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,300
this is an exceptional case.

843
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:47,770
We had serious short staffing
issues over the years. I mean,

844
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,930
I watched that department
go like this went from,

845
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,890
they don't experience staff to like
what's going on here? Like what do we,

846
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,770
what are we down to? And then there
was like a mechanical breakdown in a,

847
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:02,410
the water disinfection units, a
big one. Oh, the water was nasty.

848
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,950
Oh,
and instead of dumping the water,

849
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,250
instead of addressing the issue
over the course of the off season,

850
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:11,290
I remembered week closed.
You know,

851
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:13,480
we're only a in operation for
like five months out of the year.

852
00:47:13,481 --> 00:47:16,540
And then thereafter we're close to the
public because it's so cold because it's

853
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:20,420
so cold, so cold. So then,
so amidst that, you know,

854
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:25,360
the water disinfection unit breaks in,
let's say August or September.

855
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:30,430
We closed in like October. Well now
we're in November, December, January.

856
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,990
It's steeped. We're opening
in May. This is bad.

857
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,450
And the resolve, just a
little history. As far as the,

858
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:40,780
the water disinfection unit goes, we're
talking about an ozone machine. Ozone,

859
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:43,610
the way it works, it works in
conjunction with chlorine. It, it,

860
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:47,950
it allows for you to use less chlorine
to disinfect the water. Ozones out. Well,

861
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:50,950
how are you gonna how are you going
to treat the water in a purse in a,

862
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:54,970
in a less than rational
person thinking person's mind?

863
00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:00,150
You may think it's a good idea to put
a shit ton of chlorine in and a lot and

864
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:05,460
repeatedly in really scary doses when
employees aren't around overnight.

865
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,473
For instance.

866
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:13,620
And this went on and this continued to
go on and that's when I couldn't do it no

867
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:15,370
more.
I can't do this.

868
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:18,700
So you knew that these
animals are basically being
poisoned by all the chlorine,

869
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,650
that there was something terrible,
was serious damage done. Fuck,

870
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,780
lots of serious damage done.
Is there a movement at all to,

871
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:30,070
to outlaw these things now
after something like blackfish?

872
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,700
So I petitioned the Ontario government to

873
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,140
enact or to create stronger
animal protection laws,

874
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:41,560
which they just announced to throw in
five and a half million dollars a year

875
00:48:41,561 --> 00:48:44,710
instead of half a million dollars to
the Eos PCA to, to correct this issue.

876
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:48,040
The OSP, the, the, uh, agency that, well,

877
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,840
I don't have a lot of good
things to say about them.

878
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,010
I think we'll leave it at that for now.

879
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:54,670
But I hate that there's
an animal protection.

880
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,740
I know at the thing and that they
handle orcas and dolphins. Well, they,

881
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:03,820
they don't though. They should.
I mean, they shouldn't. It
should be like we should,

882
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:06,580
it should be the department of
humanity. You know, they should,

883
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,940
people should be able to get together,
take a look at one of those things,

884
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:12,580
get close to them and go,
okay, what are we doing here?

885
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:17,590
This is where my efforts wet
from animal protection and uh,

886
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:22,390
you know, regulations and
standards of care to abolishment.

887
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:26,130
It's got to go right in
Canada. You can't capture, uh,

888
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:30,010
any whales in your own water. Can't do it,
can't get a permit, is not gonna exist.

889
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,050
You can buy from Russia, you could buy
from Japan. Any of these drive, uh, hunts,

890
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,820
uh, the, you know, similar to the
orchids that are shipped to, to Russia.

891
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:42,820
They w you can catch him in a wild,
bring them in to ship them down.

892
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,220
I'm trying to have that outlawed.
Like,

893
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,640
you should not be able to
do that in Canada no more.
And I'm working my ass off,

894
00:49:48,641 --> 00:49:52,090
made a big stink and
we're still only this far.

895
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,270
They're this far being around
the world and like it just,

896
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:59,440
anytime pub people listening you're like
not very far. Well, it doesn't take,

897
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,680
it doesn't take long for a government.
Someone else to step in and say,

898
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:06,130
what are we talking about? Oh, we've got
to talk about jobs, and then you're gone.

899
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:07,900
You know,
you're in the back seat of the bus again,

900
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:10,600
way at the back and you're like, okay,
I've got to start claw my way back up.

901
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:12,580
How am I going to get, make a
stink again? And then southern,

902
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:13,690
like blackfish comes out.

903
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,710
I saw this dude when telecom was as his
name telecom till when Tillikum killed

904
00:50:17,711 --> 00:50:22,030
that lady. I'm the trainer that I
saw this guy freaking out about it.

905
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,720
Like this disgusting beast. They
should kill this thing. It was,

906
00:50:25,721 --> 00:50:28,190
it was fascinating. He was a,
I don't know where he was from.

907
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,030
It was from another country,

908
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:33,770
but he was talking to his friend about
it and it was interesting to watch that

909
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:37,680
site. Some, some people's
perspectives are so off like this.

910
00:50:37,681 --> 00:50:40,280
This is like some Parana
in there that's eating.

911
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:44,310
People like that thing is looking at
fish's eyes like a Paranas eyes. You know,

912
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:47,210
he buys, I'll be looking at a Budweiser
bottle. They're fucking idiots.

913
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,890
Everyone in blackfish said the same thing.

914
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:52,460
They're like telecom was the nicest
Orca ever. I knew candy big male.

915
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:55,370
I knew Ike Tillikum son.
We had till it comes soon until,

916
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:59,950
see where we'll actually successfully sued
marine land to have him remove and uh,

917
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,100
we can, how do they do that? They know
what they know. How do they do that?

918
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:05,840
How do they separate
them from their children?

919
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,040
Ike Ike was an amazingly beautiful animal.
Good natured.

920
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:14,240
He was going to kill someone. He
was going to kill someone. Wow. No.

921
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:19,250
Now is there like regulation on
how small the the tanks can be?

922
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,360
If we got nothing and
Ken, if you, Hey, listen,

923
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:26,120
if you're ever hard up, if let's say
tomorrow, you're like, shit, I need it.

924
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:30,860
I need a really high paying gig.
Just come to Ontario, dig a hole.

925
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,320
I know a couple of guys with the bacco.
Well dig a hole.

926
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:37,420
We'll fill it with whatever you want. I
got the contacts in Russia, you'll have,

927
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,580
you'll call them, you'll buy a couple of
dolphins will throw him in there. Boom,

928
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,040
you're money's made and you don't
have to worry about anything.

929
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:47,300
No regulatory bodies. There's
no import laws. There is
nothing. It's, it's the wild,

930
00:51:47,301 --> 00:51:50,870
wild west is there. Like
that's incredible. Is there,

931
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:53,360
are there new ones that are
being made now? Like they're,

932
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:56,840
they're making like a
new, no often world. Well,

933
00:51:56,841 --> 00:52:00,980
in Toronto they actually just
opened the Ripley's aquarium.

934
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:06,200
They have sharks, they've got other
sharks. I don't give a fuck about sharp.

935
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:06,981
They've got animals.

936
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:10,910
But you have to sort of wonder like
what's the environmental impact is of

937
00:52:10,911 --> 00:52:13,520
actually getting those shark. He started
thinking there. You're like, well, that,

938
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:18,050
that, that seems pretty
shitty. Yeah. Well, no doubt.
We're fucking the ocean up.

939
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:21,560
There's no doubt about that. And I,
I'm with you on that and I'm, you know,

940
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:24,230
I'm even with you on the idea of like,
I don't think,

941
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,620
I don't really have a problem with
sharks at an aquarium. I know,

942
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,650
I see them swimming around, they
get fed. I think they're stupid.

943
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,160
They're dumb killing machines
and it doesn't really bother me.

944
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,170
My problem is with
things that are thinking,

945
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,540
but that exact perspective that
you're exercising right now,

946
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,600
we may very well find out otherwise
in 50 years be like, Holy Shit,

947
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:43,780
look what we're doing. The
sharks, like they're mad geniuses,

948
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,880
we must find something. Who
knows, right? Yeah, maybe.

949
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:50,630
But it doesn't seem like
there's any natural advantage
to them being intelligent.

950
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,750
They're basically just swing
their steam machines. Yeah,

951
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:57,260
they're all they're doing,
I mean obviously I'm joking around,

952
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:59,030
I don't think we should
make sharks extinct.

953
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,110
And I do think that the impact that
we're having on all marine life is pretty

954
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:07,310
profound. It very disturbing
and not that disgust. I mean,

955
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:11,600
occasionally you'll see an article online
about the garbage patch in the Pacific

956
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,960
and then the several other patches
that they found all over the country,

957
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:15,980
all over the world,
rather,

958
00:53:15,981 --> 00:53:20,340
where there's these whirlpools generate
these areas where there's just a massive

959
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,470
con con condensed garbage and
plastic and gyres. They're called

960
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,640
Texas sized. Yeah. But you know
what happens is filled with shit.

961
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,200
Anyone decides to start
reading up on that.

962
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,660
And then what happens is the right wing
media sort of comes in and it's just

963
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:37,800
like, no, no, no. I've heard these
guys are all activists. Exactly.

964
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:41,670
I've heard that and I've actually had
conversations online with people about

965
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:44,460
that with like, look, it's not
that big a deal. It's not that big.

966
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,250
It's you've got to realize the
perspective of the oceans and norm.

967
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,620
It's the size of Texas man.

968
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:53,100
This is an area the size of Texas has
little pieces of plastic floating around

969
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:56,040
in silence. An expert, right,
and it's like goop apparently.

970
00:53:56,041 --> 00:54:00,120
It's like a lot of the plastic is sort
of dissolves this weird consistency and

971
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,640
animals wind up eating it,

972
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:05,550
opening up these animals and seeing
plastic figurines like army figurines in

973
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:09,150
them. Like that's pretty crazy.
Albatrosses a lot of their mother,

974
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,240
the mother Albatross doesn't know the
plastic is and thinks it's some kind of

975
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:16,560
food, so she feeds it to the babies
and there was this one island that is a

976
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:17,850
uninhabited by people,

977
00:54:17,851 --> 00:54:21,390
but it's a major island
for these albatrosses and
this photographer went over

978
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:24,900
there and took all these photographs
of albatrosses can hear that.

979
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,460
Obviously all these photographs of
albatrosses with plastic inside of their

980
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:33,210
bodies. Yeah, I saw that in
the nests. Like so fucked.

981
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,980
So weird.

982
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:39,450
But if you're not there and you're the
person that sees this and if you don't

983
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:43,300
look away immediately as it scares you
or caused us concern that how you're

984
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,390
going to know you just let it go.
You don't care.

985
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:48,720
Well it's also the same thing as the
zoo. It's key. It's always been there.

986
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,600
You know, there's always been garbage
in the ocean, whatever, whatever.

987
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:56,310
It's not my responsibility to fix this.
Someone out there is a real grownup.

988
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:01,470
Someone out there is older than me and
wiser and has the role of the head of the

989
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:05,160
Department of fucking keeping fish alive
and he's going to keep it together.

990
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,290
That's the perspective.
That's exercise.

991
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:10,620
The second anyone even thinks
about going to these places. Oh,

992
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,080
we're going to that place where the people
who know what they're doing or doing

993
00:55:13,081 --> 00:55:16,800
that thing that we all love and that is
awesome. So let them do their job fill.

994
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,020
The guys are trying to keep the,
wasn't for them.

995
00:55:19,021 --> 00:55:20,880
No one would even give
a fuck about orchids.

996
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,120
The Japanese would be killing them
and making sandwiches with dolphins.

997
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,280
They got away with that for a long time.
They controlled the message.

998
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,590
Now all of a sudden with you,
like you say the binary digits,

999
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:32,490
the information that you know,
the information superhighway,
we're all learning.

1000
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:36,680
Yeah. We're all learning. So what happened
with you? So you get out of there, you,

1001
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:40,740
you, you do this, you do this story. You
tell everybody what the fuck's going on.

1002
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:43,200
When is the lawsuit happened
and what is the lawsuit?

1003
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:46,960
The lawsuit doesn't happen for
a bit. The lawsuit first. The,

1004
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,030
the first thing they do is they make
it very difficult for they allegedly,

1005
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,800
I mean it's an,
it's an obligation,

1006
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:55,530
but they allegedly make things very
difficult for my girlfriend who's been

1007
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:56,820
working there for 12 years as well.

1008
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,870
She's actually Kiska the loan
Orkos head trainer. Okay.

1009
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:04,800
And things start becoming really difficult
for her. She still worked there? No,

1010
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:09,420
in the off season, they, they fired
her fast. They had to, they had to, uh,

1011
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:13,320
it was costing them a lot of money for
information to continue to be leaked.

1012
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,690
I assume that they probably
thought it was coming from her,

1013
00:56:15,691 --> 00:56:18,630
but there were a lot of people talking
at this time because the story wasn't

1014
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:21,420
just one story that come out.
When I had spoken to the media,

1015
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,130
this thing went on for like eight months

1016
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,420
a year.
They're still talking about,

1017
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:28,870
there's still stories coming out of
this thing, uh, since the lawsuits, uh,

1018
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,600
former employees and certainly
current deployed or not talking,

1019
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:35,530
but so first thing they did was made
things exceptionally difficult for her and

1020
00:56:35,531 --> 00:56:39,610
then they fired her
and then they sued her.

1021
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:44,320
Then they waited awhile or they sued
her for defamation because there was a

1022
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:46,410
video that was provided to,
um,

1023
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:51,490
the newspaper and in the video there's a,
the orcas tail is bleeding,

1024
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:54,850
it's bleeding.
And in the news article,

1025
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,340
she as a former employee who
had just been fired, said,

1026
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,590
I'm concerned for the killer
whale because she's bleeding.

1027
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:04,300
And so they're suing her for defamation.
Again, it's called a slap suit.

1028
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,770
They're not a 10th.

1029
00:57:05,771 --> 00:57:09,160
Sue You for saying that you're
concerned when you're a trainer.

1030
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:12,520
They could sue me for anything.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't.

1031
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:17,410
The lawsuit is there. Slap suits.
Again, they have, they're there.

1032
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:18,640
They don't have any real,

1033
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:21,610
like there's nothing tangible there and
they could write a fiction story about

1034
00:57:21,611 --> 00:57:24,760
you. You got to get a lawyer retain
one that's five k off the hop.

1035
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:29,110
If you're lucky, then you got to
submit a statement of defense.

1036
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:33,700
That's another couple of thousand dollars.
Kickstarter. I got an Indiegogo. Well,

1037
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:38,100
I'm on my fourth Indiegogo, uh,
fundraising campaign right now. Yeah.

1038
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:38,461
How do,

1039
00:57:38,461 --> 00:57:41,830
I know this is not an elaborate scheme
between you and the owner of that place

1040
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:43,470
to just make Indiegogo money.

1041
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,920
Can you look up the video that you
guys are pretending that you're a war?

1042
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:51,030
Maybe let's, can you just,
just sucking saps into pain,

1043
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,140
Indiegogo money.

1044
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,500
Just go on Youtube and put up like marine
land animals suffering and we'll go to

1045
00:57:55,501 --> 00:57:59,010
the video. You could, you can see, listen,
I'm just fucking around and I know,

1046
00:57:59,011 --> 00:58:00,600
I don't know.
It might be worth to watch anyways.

1047
00:58:00,601 --> 00:58:02,570
I don't know that you've seen it.
I mean you don't want to see blackfish.

1048
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,610
Honestly, I don't want to see
anymore. It is pretty brutal.

1049
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:07,710
It's all the very depressed.
Don't pull up any of that shit.

1050
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:08,880
I don't want to see it.

1051
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,880
I know what's going on and I think
now the real conversation isn't like

1052
00:58:16,351 --> 00:58:19,410
repeating the same images and watching
the same videos or we don't need to go

1053
00:58:19,411 --> 00:58:22,380
there. I think what we need to do now is
figure out how we're going to stop these

1054
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:26,070
things from being legal because this
is what I'm doing in Ontario at least.

1055
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:30,030
Right? Yeah. I think it needs to be done.
I think the people that own these places,

1056
00:58:30,031 --> 00:58:33,180
I know that they've made a living doing
this for a long time and I believe some

1057
00:58:33,181 --> 00:58:36,210
of them probably do have a
real love for these animals,

1058
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:39,900
but people didn't need to stop. Everyone
need to stop. The trainers need to stop.

1059
00:58:39,901 --> 00:58:43,790
They need to stop. It's, it's dark.
It's just too fucked up. You're, you're,

1060
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:45,870
you're in slaving intelligent animals.

1061
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:49,630
It's tough to get to the trainers.
They're young people who's going,

1062
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:54,520
who are going to get a kick
ass gig. That's the Gig. I
mean, again, paradigm shift.

1063
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,330
Up until a year ago, this was the
case. Now, you know, with the,

1064
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:01,980
with the Toronto Star investigation
in the marine land with blackfish,

1065
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:05,800
people are now just like, Whoa, like what
that commercial said? It was awesome.

1066
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,520
Remember that jingle like that was
awesome. Why is this job shitty?

1067
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:13,280
Why are these animals being tortured?
Yeah. Now they know, but again, the,

1068
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,190
the industry control the
information for so long.

1069
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:19,420
So Russia is still ganking them out of
the water. We don't do that anymore. Uh,

1070
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:22,820
the states don't,
you need a to import from anywhere.

1071
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:25,460
And because what happens is to,
to apply for a permit,

1072
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:28,250
there's a period of like public,
a opinion or whatever.

1073
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:31,700
They sort of write in and basically these
agencies get the shit kicked out on.

1074
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:36,200
Someone really needs to make a movie
where a human gets kidnapped and taken to

1075
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:40,730
an alien fucking human world.
That will be a fascinating movie.

1076
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:45,590
When he got taken to some alien version
of seaworld and humans are doing fucking

1077
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:49,060
cartwheels and shit, I'd be
the right time. It's a leap.

1078
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,120
Like that could totally be like some
crazy avatar type movie where they would

1079
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:57,050
have meetings to decide when human is
allowed to be transferred to another

1080
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,330
facility,
removed them from their families,

1081
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,910
or are you going to have an incessant
scene? Because that's what goes on.

1082
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:05,720
A lot of these facilities really with
the trainers, not with the trainer stone.

1083
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,930
What are you saying? The
animals. The animals.

1084
01:00:08,931 --> 01:00:11,930
Of course there's not enough natural
selection. There's not enough out there.

1085
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:14,600
You've got to get the killer whales.
It's difficult to bring them in,

1086
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:17,180
so they just want to fuck in their
daughters and stuff. They don't want to,

1087
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:19,460
but if you get them at the right time
and they're frustrated enough, I imagine,

1088
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:24,080
I can't rationalize why medically candy
would do that to the Osha, but that,

1089
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:28,900
that conceivably to happen so
dark. That's so dark. Yeah,

1090
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,400
that was a tough one. Oh, it's so dark.

1091
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:34,370
It's just fucking torture all around.

1092
01:00:34,371 --> 01:00:38,660
It's so crazy that no one recognizes
that and it's because they'd been

1093
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:42,560
extracting money from this.
This being sanctioned for a long time.

1094
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:45,950
It's generated a tremendous amount of
money and they've gotten addicted to that

1095
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:48,080
money and they can't find
another way to make money.

1096
01:00:48,081 --> 01:00:51,110
They can't open up a barbecue shop.
They can't fucking sell hats.

1097
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,330
I want to sell cowboy boots.
Fuck this dolphin training.

1098
01:00:53,331 --> 01:00:56,630
Know everybody keeps doing the same
thing over and over again because it's

1099
01:00:56,631 --> 01:01:00,350
always been a viable job. They reinvested
the money in government lobbying.

1100
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:03,350
They reinvest that money in controlling
the message through the media.

1101
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,570
They reinvested the money, you know,
making the right friends. And if you saw,

1102
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:11,190
if you knew, especially in the small
community of Niagara Falls in Ontario,

1103
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:16,160
what the angles and the things that are
happening, it's like, are you kidding me?

1104
01:01:16,161 --> 01:01:17,720
Like I assumed I was
up against some tough,

1105
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:20,540
I knew it was gonna be difficult to try
to get these laws and it was not gonna

1106
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:23,150
be easy. I mean, who? Who passes
laws, who lobbied to pass laws?

1107
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,300
These laws that are coming out
are jokes, man. They're jokes.

1108
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:27,200
They don't address what was,

1109
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:31,730
what was the big stink a year ago when
these stories come out? Like what? Wow,

1110
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:32,121
there's,
oh,

1111
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:36,020
the laws that basically
the Ontario government just
celebrated the announcement

1112
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:36,621
because again,

1113
01:01:36,621 --> 01:01:39,800
this was a big stink about when we had
come out and we petitioned the Ontario

1114
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:42,410
government, um, they made a
law or I'd rather, they said,

1115
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,040
we're going to create standards
of care for marine mammals.

1116
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:49,610
We're going to enhance our
animal protection. It sounds
good. They announced all,

1117
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,920
the only thing they announced thus
far is another announcement of, uh,

1118
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:57,620
standards of care to come,
which are going to be,

1119
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,010
which are going to be weighed
against the impact of communities.

1120
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:04,760
So suddenly taking care of a dolphin has
something to do with whether or not Joe

1121
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,140
Schmo down the street gets a job
from the facility around the corner.

1122
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,280
There's a relate, there's,
that's relative somehow bullshit.

1123
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:11,900
But that's apparently coming.
And again,

1124
01:02:11,901 --> 01:02:14,090
we built in a long time for
these fricking, you know,

1125
01:02:14,091 --> 01:02:15,380
it's always announcements
of announcements.

1126
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:18,440
Then they announced an
influx of cash to the OSP,

1127
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,710
5 million extra dollars a
year to protect animals.

1128
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,100
Always Pca, Bung this thing up. The owner,

1129
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:30,180
allegedly the owner of marine land bought
the land that the Osp ca operates out

1130
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:30,510
of.

1131
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:35,100
And I recall in my history seeing quite
frequently the LSPC agents coming in and

1132
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:37,050
we're talking like what
does that sound stand for?

1133
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:40,170
Ontario Society of prevention
of cruelty to animals. Okay,

1134
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,510
so if there's animal cruelty happening,

1135
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:44,190
you would assume that these are the
people that are going to come in and say,

1136
01:02:44,191 --> 01:02:47,670
Hey, stop that now and you
know, write a fine or something.

1137
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:53,120
But well when their office is in the
building on the land that was donated by

1138
01:02:53,671 --> 01:02:55,080
the owner of the park,

1139
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:59,640
that becomes a bit of a conflict of
interest cause I don't know that that that

1140
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:02,610
individual is being paid 10 bones and
hour to drive around from facility to

1141
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:05,670
facility. If that job should have come
a is going to turn around and be like,

1142
01:03:05,671 --> 01:03:05,971
hey man,

1143
01:03:05,971 --> 01:03:10,170
like we're shutting you down because
that chlorine that's causing a animal's

1144
01:03:10,171 --> 01:03:14,520
eyes to bleed, uh, skin to flake off
all sorts, everything else that's cruel.

1145
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:18,780
There's just, it's very thin.
The rules are not there.

1146
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,500
The other thing about the Ontario be seen,

1147
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:24,150
the offices are on seaworld
properties that we were saying. No,

1148
01:03:24,151 --> 01:03:28,320
I'm not saying that. I'm saying in my
case or hypothetically, the owner of mine,

1149
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:30,630
not hypothetically matter of factly,
the owner of my,

1150
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:35,730
the facility that I worked at bought
the land and donated it to the Osp ca of

1151
01:03:35,731 --> 01:03:39,300
which there, uh, office, uh, uh,

1152
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:43,050
of which they operate out of.
That's hilarious. It doesn't stop.

1153
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:46,860
It doesn't end there man. It
doesn't, where's it end? Well,

1154
01:03:46,861 --> 01:03:48,630
it ends with me fighting
lawsuits. Right, right, right.

1155
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,030
When you say it doesn't end there,
like what else? What other ways?

1156
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,040
That's hilarious. The fat. I mean,

1157
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:56,000
that's like heroin dealers donating
money to the cops. Like, here,

1158
01:03:56,001 --> 01:03:58,920
we're going to buy your fucking police
station. Let us keep dealing heroin,

1159
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:03,300
please. So what happened with me? So
basically the, the newspaper outlet,

1160
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,940
the media outlet that took our
story and ran with it really,

1161
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:09,150
really beat the shit and
exposed a lot of things. Okay.

1162
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,350
Marine land hires this gentleman
by the name of John Beatty.

1163
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:17,820
He's the former McGinty senior
adviser. Mcginty was the, uh,

1164
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:22,350
was the prime minister or rather
the premier of Ontario, this guy,

1165
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:26,280
the owner Marineland high or
rather rather marine land.

1166
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:30,090
The corporation hires John Beatty,
former advisor to the liberal government.

1167
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:35,400
A gentleman by the name of uh, Shit,
I'm drawing a blank, but anyways,

1168
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:40,850
uh, hires this senior, uh, you know what
I'm talking about if I'm consulting,

1169
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:43,980
whatever. So this guy comes
out with a shit ton of spins,

1170
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,180
videos and everything else,

1171
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,880
and then he starts shaking the hands
of all the friends and the liberal

1172
01:04:47,881 --> 01:04:50,310
government. So when the announcement of
these new rules come out, you're like,

1173
01:04:50,311 --> 01:04:51,660
of course nothing's coming out.

1174
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:56,960
You just hired the
premier's ex chief advisor.

1175
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,790
He knows all the fricking people.
What are you talking about?

1176
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:03,300
Then you start looking at it at the local
level of all the government, while the,

1177
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:05,340
the, the, the Ministry of Environment.

1178
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,610
The minister is a friend
of the owners as well.

1179
01:05:08,611 --> 01:05:11,460
There's great deal of history
everywhere, here, everywhere.

1180
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:14,580
So everything one by one can remember a
lot of agencies went in there to it to

1181
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:15,414
investigate.

1182
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:20,420
They took a really long time sort of
releasing their findings and everything

1183
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:22,450
sort of went by the wayside.

1184
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:27,660
Slowly but surely there's there throw
a lawsuits around like like a candy at

1185
01:05:27,701 --> 01:05:31,540
Halloween, but everything else is
just sort of, because you know,

1186
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:34,470
the stink sort of mellowed out didn't it?
You know,

1187
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:36,520
you make a stink now in a year.

1188
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:39,310
Well a lot of things are in the news
now that are different for that matter.

1189
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:44,260
Mcginty drop like that stepped down.
So I lost that here I had to uh,

1190
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:45,600
this premiere that was going to,
yeah,

1191
01:05:45,601 --> 01:05:49,480
we're going to do something real sad about
this. Then he bails out. I'm like, okay,

1192
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:51,710
what happen to those laws we were
working on? Because you know, I was,

1193
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:53,620
I was going traveling back
and forth to Queen's Park.

1194
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:56,110
I was speaking with the Minister
of community safety. You know,

1195
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:58,180
she's the one responsible for the OSP.
Ca Acts.

1196
01:05:58,181 --> 01:05:59,950
She's going to change things
and I'm talking to her,

1197
01:05:59,951 --> 01:06:02,230
we're going to change things and I
think we are, I really believe this.

1198
01:06:02,231 --> 01:06:05,800
I can't believe I'm making a change and
in the world here I get sued for doing

1199
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:09,490
that. I'm getting sued now
I'm in a lawsuit. Holy Shit.
Well she can't talk to me.

1200
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,260
Oh, that, that's in the courts
now. Can't talk no more.

1201
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:14,980
And then everything's falling by
the wayside. I'm like, Holy Shit.

1202
01:06:14,981 --> 01:06:19,981
Like turns out like defending animals
is a really scary thing to do.

1203
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:20,900
Well,
it's not

1204
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,280
really just defending animals.

1205
01:06:22,281 --> 01:06:24,530
What you're doing is you're
going up against a machine,

1206
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,320
you're going up against a machine that
generates money and as a bunch of people

1207
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:30,290
that are profiting from it. Right.
So what's happening? Big machine big.

1208
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,720
And at the end of the day it's all
about it comes down to the monies.

1209
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:35,120
It comes down to the monies and
these police facilities generate.

1210
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,090
Now when your situation
start and when was black?

1211
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:42,050
Black fist was only released like a
month ago or two, right? Uh, on CNN,

1212
01:06:42,051 --> 01:06:46,640
like a month and change ago. Yeah.
And when did your scenario fired?

1213
01:06:46,641 --> 01:06:48,290
When it all caught up pass.

1214
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:53,120
August 15th of last year was the day
that our story come out. And again,

1215
01:06:53,121 --> 01:06:53,631
it wasn't just me.

1216
01:06:53,631 --> 01:06:56,480
We were like eight or nine people at that
point that it kept building cause more

1217
01:06:56,481 --> 01:06:57,360
stories would come out like,

1218
01:06:57,740 --> 01:07:01,010
and then more people would come out until
the lawsuit started dropping. Right.

1219
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:05,930
That's when people are like,
what? And you, you don't
plan on suing them back. Oh,

1220
01:07:05,931 --> 01:07:09,410
I'm suing them back. What
are you suing them back for?
Well, defamation, number one,

1221
01:07:09,411 --> 01:07:09,890
they really,

1222
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:14,890
well they released a video of me calling
me an animal liberation army leading

1223
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:19,460
like they turned around and made
me eat meat. I used to eat meat.

1224
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:22,790
I used to exclusively, I was a meat
and potato guy pounded all day.

1225
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:27,860
Now I'm having a real tough time. Like
I'll, I'll eat meat, but when I do,

1226
01:07:27,861 --> 01:07:31,970
I feel guilt so it makes it
less appetizing. I can't get
off cheese. I'm off milk,

1227
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:36,260
you know, eating a hell of a lot
healthier, exercising more, you know,

1228
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:38,120
different things happening and
you try to clear your mind.

1229
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:39,220
When I processing this,

1230
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:43,900
I have a friend who's a vegetarian, he
eats eggs because eggs come from chickens.

1231
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:45,130
They just lay them.
Then they're not,

1232
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,380
we have this idea that eggs
going to become a chick.

1233
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,550
They're not the chickens
lay eggs every day. Um,

1234
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:55,390
and he'll eat meat if somebody
he know killed it if it's hunted,

1235
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:59,200
but he won't, he won't buy any factory
bought me and you want, he says,

1236
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:01,780
I don't want to participate in that
system. He's like, you don't have to,

1237
01:08:01,781 --> 01:08:02,890
you can get organic eggs.

1238
01:08:02,891 --> 01:08:05,260
There's nothing wrong with those eggs
and you can get your protein from that.

1239
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:08,410
He just won't, he won't participate
in the cheeseburger system.

1240
01:08:08,411 --> 01:08:12,700
He won't participate in the
factory farming system. And it's,

1241
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:15,710
it's basically the broad
spectrum of human behavior,

1242
01:08:15,711 --> 01:08:19,220
the fact that we can be almost saintly
and beautiful and people can pick people

1243
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:22,190
up off the side of the road and,
and help them along their way.

1244
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,510
And then on the other hand,

1245
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,830
we could be the type of
person that stuff's a thousand
chickens and do a fucking

1246
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:31,350
10 foot square room and has them
stacked on top of each other,

1247
01:08:31,351 --> 01:08:34,280
shitting on each other's heads and then
just pull them out and cut their heads

1248
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:37,340
off. And you know they can't walk because
we've engineered them to have these

1249
01:08:37,341 --> 01:08:41,540
gigantic fucking breasts within
a, you know, a year of being born.

1250
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,540
I don't think a lot of people know
that it's when you turn your wins,

1251
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:45,770
when you open your eyes to that,
if you're,

1252
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:49,550
if again it comes back to there's the
truth, how much you want to delve into it.

1253
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:51,440
As soon as it gets scary,
people tuck tail and run.

1254
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,800
But it's just we've got to figure out
what the fuck makes the difference in the

1255
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:55,610
spectrum.

1256
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:59,630
What makes a person that goes out of
their way not to step on a bug and what

1257
01:08:59,631 --> 01:09:03,650
makes a person who has zero problem with
stuff and a thousand chickens into a

1258
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:05,350
fucking closet?
Like what?

1259
01:09:05,351 --> 01:09:08,720
What's the difference between those two
individuals and how do you bridge that

1260
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:09,950
gap?
How do you,

1261
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:14,951
how do you make it so that everybody
who's walking around like number one,

1262
01:09:15,771 --> 01:09:19,910
the number one thing that they're
thinking of is don't, don't be cruel.

1263
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:22,700
Don't be evil and nasty.
Don't,

1264
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:27,730
don't do something that would ultimately
be looked on in Har if it was made

1265
01:09:27,891 --> 01:09:30,980
public. That's essentially what
a lot of factory farming is.

1266
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:33,050
It depends what perspective you're
exercising and you're exercising.

1267
01:09:33,051 --> 01:09:36,110
The perspective of person whose
objective is to make a lot of money.

1268
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,460
I know the objective of a,

1269
01:09:37,461 --> 01:09:40,640
a person whose objective is to
understand where their food comes from.

1270
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,630
Well then most people are not, they're
not going to eat factory farmed meats.

1271
01:09:44,631 --> 01:09:48,890
No question. Yeah. Most people have zero
idea how dark the whole situation is.

1272
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:53,750
The more I know, the less I, I went
to a, um, uh, butchering house,

1273
01:09:53,751 --> 01:09:58,640
a slaughterhouse I guess, uh, once
for a fear factor stunt and dude,

1274
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:01,670
when, I mean I'm not a like
a fucking woo kind of guy.

1275
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:06,170
I think a lot of woo woo
stuff is bullshit. But I felt
that that place felt sad.

1276
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:10,160
You can feel it felt sad,
like the air felt sad.

1277
01:10:10,161 --> 01:10:11,870
Like it was a big pocket of death.

1278
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:14,840
My buddy worked for the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency and he had to go in

1279
01:10:14,841 --> 01:10:18,040
there. He's a vegetarian.
He's, Geez, I guess you'd call
them a Vegan at this point.

1280
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,300
He walked in and he started
telling me about hot dogs,

1281
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:23,510
but the bags that are collecting the
stuff to make hot dogs. I'm like,

1282
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:27,530
they're so delicious though. I'm like,
I'm like crowd a little mustard. I'm like,

1283
01:10:27,531 --> 01:10:29,660
I can't imagine that you would do
this. She's like, how to do it?

1284
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:31,450
Had to go in there. I had
to see it. What's the,

1285
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:33,440
it was just checking
how disgusting it was.

1286
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:35,540
That was his job was just
go in there and inspect it.

1287
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:39,030
I mean whatever their regulations are
for the kitten food inspection agency,

1288
01:10:39,031 --> 01:10:41,720
he was going in and taking a look at their
operation and deciding whether or not

1289
01:10:41,721 --> 01:10:44,900
this was acceptable practices and
whatever parameters that he's trying to,

1290
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:47,870
you know, determine. So hot
dogs are like all like kneecaps.

1291
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,440
It's pretty gross sticks and assholes
and stuff. False ground up together.

1292
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:52,041
It's pretty shitty.

1293
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:56,300
I can think of tastier things
that are less sort of disgusting,

1294
01:10:56,450 --> 01:11:00,800
but when you get them really good
ones, gourmet hot dogs, they suck too.

1295
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:01,790
Like when you get like the,

1296
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:04,010
those really nice ones that
snap when you bite into them.

1297
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,940
I'm not going to turn around and try to
be the guy get sued by the hot dogs in

1298
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:09,550
the street as well.
That's the last thing I did.

1299
01:11:09,551 --> 01:11:14,430
Now to those fucking hot dogs in New York,
man, those dirty hot dogs is Joey Diaz

1300
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:18,570
calls him those just
setting up shop on a corner,

1301
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:19,650
boiling some water.

1302
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,880
I watched the guy and I dared him
eat five like Toronto dogs like this.

1303
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:25,140
I couldn't believe he could do it.

1304
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,540
I think shortly after we actually put a
cracker up to his mouth and open it in

1305
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:31,010
weight because we thought maybe a warm
would come up because this was not right.

1306
01:11:31,011 --> 01:11:34,920
There's not a big guy. He pounded those
things. Couldn't believe Kobiashi guy.

1307
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:37,290
The guy wins those eating contest.
He's not a big guy.

1308
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,920
I had to pay for those hot docs.
Well, it's only five hotdogs, dude.

1309
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:44,190
He had to pay with this shits and farts.
That's actually one has asked,

1310
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:46,080
almost felt like in an
hour and a half late,

1311
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:49,560
clinching it tight like it's his assholes
like a marathon runner and the last

1312
01:11:49,561 --> 01:11:53,070
couple of miles he did from it.
Get a pretty legendary story.

1313
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:58,490
Not that good. It's not a good story.
You Canadians are much more [inaudible],

1314
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:02,430
much kinder and what you judged to be
a good story. The story is sucked out.

1315
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:07,380
A guy who ate hot dogs who gives a
fuck. We're so kind. We open pits up,

1316
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,010
fill it up with whatever you want to
call it, if you want to call it water.

1317
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:12,990
Everybody does that, right?
That's the problem. Yeah.

1318
01:12:12,991 --> 01:12:16,500
Well especially out in Europe right now
and other places, I mean not the UK,

1319
01:12:16,501 --> 01:12:17,221
they basically they,

1320
01:12:17,221 --> 01:12:20,710
they enacted standards of care that
were so difficult to abide by that it

1321
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,590
eradicated the entire industry
in the UK, in the UK, the UK,

1322
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:28,080
and this is what I tried to hope.
This is what I tried to get done here too.

1323
01:12:28,081 --> 01:12:30,030
It's like,
listen to dolphin can exist in captivity.

1324
01:12:30,031 --> 01:12:31,980
If you can't give it a 200 foot pool,

1325
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:36,510
it's not economically viable or really
probably possible to dig a pit that big.

1326
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:39,510
So guess what? If you can't abide
by it, you can't have dolphins.

1327
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:43,590
This is the aspirations. These were
my aspirations. Um, then look at it.

1328
01:12:43,591 --> 01:12:45,690
It's gonna happen, but I don't
want to give up hope. I mean,

1329
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:50,970
it should be illegal and we can't
really discuss it any further without

1330
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:53,190
repeating ourselves over and
over and over and over again.

1331
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:57,360
The bottom line is they're smart. We
should just talk about illegal, my loss.

1332
01:12:57,361 --> 01:13:00,320
Who should be too, like I right now
at the fact that we're talking now. I,

1333
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,220
it's conceivable that I come home too.
I mean,

1334
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:06,880
I know I'm going to come home to great
deal of really angry worded letters. Um,

1335
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,140
because of you talking on
this podcast. Oh yeah. Oh Man.

1336
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,750
You should see the shit that goes on now.

1337
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:16,200
Who's saying sends you these angry
letters? Well, my Lord deals with it,

1338
01:13:16,201 --> 01:13:17,160
so he doesn't really tell him.

1339
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,790
He just says these are from the people
in the opposition lawyer versus lawyer

1340
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,110
camp.
What do they think?

1341
01:13:22,111 --> 01:13:24,630
They think that they could just keep
doing this and just scare people away.

1342
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:27,170
It's trying to make me broke.
Yeah, it, I mean, it's working.

1343
01:13:27,171 --> 01:13:29,190
It cost me like when I get my bills,
they're not small.

1344
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:32,640
These are like really big scary
bills like these or I could,

1345
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:34,260
I could have bought half
a house at this point,

1346
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:39,030
but instead pumping this
money into defending against
plotting to steal a walrus.

1347
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:42,660
I mean, that's a peculiar thing
to, to, to defend against,

1348
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,500
but it doesn't matter what I'm
defending against what it did.

1349
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,930
Is that something they're accusing you of?
Oh yeah.

1350
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,720
Will you actually plotting
to steal a walrus? Well,

1351
01:13:51,721 --> 01:13:54,150
if you and I sat here and said, Oh
man, we should steal that walrus.

1352
01:13:54,151 --> 01:13:55,710
What do you think is that
plotting to steal at Walrus?

1353
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:58,650
I would say that's potty
then maybe I'm guilty.

1354
01:13:58,651 --> 01:14:02,470
But what they won't be able to
produce is a refrigerated, uh,

1355
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:04,260
airplane cargo plane,

1356
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:08,010
a beach front house in the Arctic
for her to live in this and that,

1357
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:11,950
like plotting to steal the Walrus
is a bit of a stretch. Okay. Um,

1358
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,760
so you were caught having conversations
where you're talking about, no, no, no,

1359
01:14:15,761 --> 01:14:20,620
not in the least. So based talk about
this. Oh, I can talk about this.

1360
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:24,640
Absolutely. Okay. I think I
can, oh, there's smooshy there.
I mean if you want to go,

1361
01:14:24,641 --> 01:14:27,760
if you want to back things up under
that man, how fucked is that picture?

1362
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:31,740
That picture Walrus is sitting
on a concrete floor with,

1363
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,020
with her arm through,
it's a her right? Yeah.

1364
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:39,550
With her arm through a fucking prison
cage. That's so dark, man. So the,

1365
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:41,730
the story of smooshy is,
you know,

1366
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:46,030
she come in from like wild caught
18 months of age, 200 pounds.

1367
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:50,180
She's this big, he's a big
pillow. Beautiful Amy. She's
a baby. She's not good.

1368
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:52,470
She didn't come in alone. She comes
up with some other animals, uh,

1369
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,290
walruses where they catch
on Russia and the Black Sea.

1370
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:01,360
So she comes in and we start then now
we've got to get blood from and we got to

1371
01:15:01,361 --> 01:15:05,560
see if these animals are healthy. So the
way you do it with an untrained animal,

1372
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,350
you throw a big net on him,
physically jumped, grabbed them,

1373
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:11,800
the fet sticks a needle in their vet or
train or someone and they go to take the

1374
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:12,880
blood out.
Well,

1375
01:15:12,881 --> 01:15:16,180
during this procedure there was another
walrus there that we were doing the

1376
01:15:16,181 --> 01:15:19,200
procedure on and here's smooshy who's,
you know,

1377
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:23,200
climbing up on the other walrus. It's
making things very difficult. He Mat,

1378
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,780
as you can imagine,
these guys are like linebackers.

1379
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:30,460
So all I did was I put my hands in front
of her face like this and she opened up

1380
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:35,440
her nostrils and I, I remember this
vividly. She took a big breath.

1381
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,300
She started to follow me. After that, I
started to back up this animal follow me,

1382
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:44,170
big eyes staring at me, following me.
I've never seen anything like this before.

1383
01:15:44,171 --> 01:15:47,260
I thought it was like,
this is going to be just a onetime thing.

1384
01:15:47,261 --> 01:15:49,270
She just followed me because
this just made her nervous.

1385
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:53,980
What had happened at 18 months of age
and at that specific time was I had

1386
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:58,270
imprinted on her. That's what happens
in the wild. You're a mother, Walrus,

1387
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:02,620
you shit out a calf that animal's going
to tattoo to its brain, your smell,

1388
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:04,450
your sight,
the sound,

1389
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:08,560
everything so that you can be
identified in a herd of hundreds.

1390
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:12,370
This happened at 18 months of age.
So she imprinted on you,

1391
01:16:12,371 --> 01:16:16,630
just you imprinted on her because she was
panicking. I think it has to have been,

1392
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,120
it was at that moment. And no
question because I know what the baby,

1393
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:20,500
while this was all going down,

1394
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:24,190
and you can imagine the stress of
being caught only maybe months before

1395
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,840
separated from your mother or witnessing
your mother die in a harvest of source.

1396
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:32,140
Jesus Christ. So this happens. So
this animal I imprinted on her,

1397
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:37,000
well this is, this is an
anomaly. This doesn't happen.
This isn't, hey, here's food.

1398
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:42,640
We're like best friends now.
Great. This is your mind, mommy.

1399
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:48,430
That's the relationship we have. It's
crazy. Wow. Yeah, that's intense.

1400
01:16:48,431 --> 01:16:52,420
So then when you start factoring in the
fact that she's in the pool with a lot

1401
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:57,421
of crazy chlorine values and she's getting
chemical burns and everything else.

1402
01:16:57,971 --> 01:17:01,420
And I'm like,
so you almost have a,

1403
01:17:01,421 --> 01:17:03,580
a paternal relationship with this?

1404
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:08,320
Definitely have definitely
have a personal hours. Wow,

1405
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:11,750
that's crazy. And all because of the
fact they're not cleaning the water,

1406
01:17:11,751 --> 01:17:14,600
she's getting sick.
Well there's more to it than that.

1407
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,700
She come in at 2004 so she's probably 10,
a little over 10 years old now.

1408
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:24,980
Um,
this relationship also turned into,

1409
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,990
created some problems.

1410
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:31,280
It manifested in like physical
manifestations of stress.

1411
01:17:31,281 --> 01:17:36,281
He developed this uncontrollable
regurgitating issue where
she doesn't keep her

1412
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:41,150
fish down. She pukes it up and it's
from anxiety, from separation anxiety.

1413
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:45,570
I'm fast forwarding a bit from that
moment of the imprint to now or, well,

1414
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:49,760
it's a prior to now of course. So there
was, there was a lot of challenges that,

1415
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:53,060
that relationship post.
So you try to train well,

1416
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:58,130
so I developed this system where the
animal consumes fish and thereafter

1417
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:02,960
consumed Jello. I would teach her to
eat the Gel and play with the Jello.

1418
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,540
So try to keep her from throwing up the,

1419
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:07,970
the nutrients that are keeping her from
gaining weight and being healthy. Right.

1420
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:11,570
So I tried to train all the
other people on this, you know,

1421
01:18:11,571 --> 01:18:14,750
tried to wean myself out a
number of times. But again,

1422
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:18,500
so the relationship was a blessing in
the fact that this is, this is amazing,

1423
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:19,310
this is crazy.

1424
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:23,960
And it was also an more so now like an
absolute curse because giving a shit

1425
01:18:23,961 --> 01:18:26,630
about an animal in that at that level.

1426
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:30,530
Like what you're saying that that
parental, uh, relationship, that bond,

1427
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:32,840
that's tough man.

1428
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:35,600
Like to see what she's going through
and then you start realizing like,

1429
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:40,820
I don't know what I can do to save
her because she's going to die.

1430
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:43,613
Wow.

1431
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:48,330
And she's back there at the same
place where you used to work still.

1432
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:52,380
I can't be 100% positive.
She's still alive right now.

1433
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:57,470
I did see a couple of videos in the summer
and those videos were tough to watch

1434
01:18:58,051 --> 01:19:01,410
cause she's still doing the same thing.
They don't really use her in the show.

1435
01:19:01,411 --> 01:19:04,050
She's well hidden in the back.
No one sees her.

1436
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:07,980
They'll use her in the show sporadically,

1437
01:19:07,981 --> 01:19:11,070
but it's difficult to use it because
all she's doing is looking for me.

1438
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:14,160
That's all she ever does.
She comes out and she looks for me.

1439
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:16,950
Here was this video that come
out into summer. Sure. Shit,

1440
01:19:16,951 --> 01:19:20,430
I'm seeing she's and she's skinnier.
Fuck like

1441
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:25,170
what?
What can I do?

1442
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,990
There's another thing that's important
to remember. When I quit marine Len,

1443
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:33,720
we had an understanding I was
to remain in this animal's life.

1444
01:19:33,721 --> 01:19:38,540
I live a football throw away from
this facility I gave my two weeks.

1445
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:42,140
It's very clear
understanding she needs me.

1446
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:47,270
Vets have expressed it.
Everyone knows it. She needs me.

1447
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:50,720
That's the only way we could treat her
medically is if I'm there for her to

1448
01:19:50,721 --> 01:19:55,430
follow me out of the water to go over to
do whatever various treatments we were

1449
01:19:55,431 --> 01:19:57,950
able to do with her on
account of that relationship.

1450
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:01,970
So we had this understanding and then I
was actually called in a couple of days

1451
01:20:01,971 --> 01:20:05,630
after I had quit to treat a
dolphin because it was not
a lot of experience that

1452
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,070
was remaining at the
park to deal with this,

1453
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,450
so the relationship seemed legit.
Okay,

1454
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:16,710
I can move on as long as
I can keep her from dying.

1455
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:20,640
I don't want her to die. Right then.

1456
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:22,650
Then I had a conversation with a guy,

1457
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:26,010
he had worked at marine land for
like 30 plus years. He was like,

1458
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:31,020
he was up here to me. This guy was one
of the nicest men I know and he was like,

1459
01:20:31,021 --> 01:20:35,070
Phil, you just got to let go. Like
you know, just, just take a recess,

1460
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:38,190
feeling a lot of anxiety about this whole
thing. Then I'd resolved. You know what?

1461
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:44,010
I'm going to go. We ended the
relationship amicably. Marine Lana die.

1462
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:47,010
I'm going to go visit smooshy.
It's been a month.

1463
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,810
The longest I've ever not been in her
life since her arrival in 2004 it was 10

1464
01:20:51,811 --> 01:20:54,810
days. She lost 30 pounds over
that 10 days. This was a month.

1465
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:58,800
Now I'm going to see smooshy.
So I show up to the park,

1466
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:04,490
I get to the security gate to gate
that I walked through for 12 years.

1467
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,500
Every day.
No one bats an eye.

1468
01:21:07,501 --> 01:21:11,700
Of course family here I'm
being rejected at the door,

1469
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:14,820
like can't come in. And I'm like, what
do mean it can't come in? And we have,

1470
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:19,560
we have that understanding. We have
like I'm still taking care of smooshy.

1471
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:23,880
Okay, whatever. So I called my girlfriend
who's worked at the time in the park,

1472
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:26,490
can you bring you one of my free
passes I got to pay to get in?

1473
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:31,440
And the owner's son sees me, he grabs
me by the shoulders, says no, no Phil,

1474
01:21:31,441 --> 01:21:34,380
your like family here now you can come in.
Well unbenounced to him,

1475
01:21:34,381 --> 01:21:35,214
there's been some

1476
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:41,430
something that happened
at the administration
administrative end where Phil

1477
01:21:41,431 --> 01:21:45,150
can't come in. The more it's time to,
there was a lot of concern when I quit,

1478
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:48,930
but it was not good circumstances.
You might let go on a podcast.

1479
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:54,540
I'm going to get sued for so
much more. Nonetheless, I get in

1480
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:58,680
and people are really nervous,

1481
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:04,920
so I know what's going on. I run back
to go see smooshy to the back. I say,

1482
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:07,190
I run. That'd be better for
the movie. I don't think I ran,

1483
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:09,990
but I'm trying to say nonchalant, but
walked back like we're smooshy, right?

1484
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:15,080
I go see her and she's
lying on the pavement.

1485
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:18,900
Bone dry Waller says need water
in the heat. They need ice.

1486
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,960
There's no ice and site and she's lost.

1487
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:24,840
This has been 30 days that I've been gone.
She's lost.

1488
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:26,520
Okay.

1489
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:30,060
Maybe hundreds of pounds. She's
really amazing at it. Whoa.

1490
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:32,640
I'm looking at this like,
are you,

1491
01:22:32,641 --> 01:22:36,510
how much does she weigh total while she
should wait it around 2000 pounds now,

1492
01:22:36,511 --> 01:22:40,020
but she, at the time she
weighed maybe 12 again, she was,

1493
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:42,360
she was a smaller animal and difficult
to keep the weight on because that

1494
01:22:42,361 --> 01:22:45,690
regurgitation issue, she was
weighing in real thin at this point.

1495
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,220
I couldn't believe it when I saw her.
I'm like,

1496
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:51,720
so first thing the vet does go get meds,
she'll respond to me.

1497
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:55,140
So we give her her appetite, stimulants
and antibiotic. Everything else.

1498
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:59,400
I'm trying to keep that
straight face like, Huh, walk
out. Like everything's cool.

1499
01:22:59,401 --> 01:23:03,090
Right. That night my girlfriend
comes home and she's like,

1500
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,360
you know when you get hurt you don't. When
you're hurt, you're hurt by something,

1501
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:10,510
but you know what it is so you
know that you're in a shitty place.

1502
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:12,310
Okay.

1503
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:17,310
The real pain is when you're hurting
so much that you don't know that you're

1504
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:22,330
hurting. You're just sort of milling to
just sort of off the, you know you're not,

1505
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,500
you're not in a processing that
she come home and she's like, Whoa,

1506
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,040
what's ups? Nothing's up. Right.
Because on a few beers, whatever,

1507
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:34,270
wasn't till the next day that I was like,
wow,

1508
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:37,270
like she might, she's
going to die. I have to,

1509
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,170
I have to come to terms with this reality.
This is fucked up.

1510
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:47,180
That's when the resolve for me said.
I was like, fuck it. Use My name,

1511
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:52,400
use my face, get the story out.
Now if I can get eyes on smooshy,

1512
01:23:54,170 --> 01:23:57,740
they got to take better care of her.
They got to do something. They can't.

1513
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:01,550
Not People are going to
be paying attention now.
That's where it all lies on.

1514
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:05,120
Smooshy if I got all eyes on smooshy,
they have the cat let her die.

1515
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:07,880
But will she just die without you?
I mean,

1516
01:24:07,881 --> 01:24:10,790
if she's imprinted to you and
you are her mother, if he, if,

1517
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,700
if she doesn't see you, will
she, will she die without you?

1518
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:17,600
That separation anxiety again, I'd only
ever been apart from her for 10 days.

1519
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,540
She lost 30 pounds. This her, that's her.

1520
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:24,580
That's an inside edition piece that
was done years ago. Normous she's tiny.

1521
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:29,180
So that's a tiny walrus right there.
Well, even a tiny Waller's is enormous.

1522
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:30,380
My God,
they're so big.

1523
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:35,480
This was a fluff piece that inside edition
did look at the size of our mind. God,

1524
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,750
what a strange animal.
And these are all from the Black Sea.

1525
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:43,440
She's from the black seat.
Yeah. Where else would they
live? Walruses um, I dunno,

1526
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:45,860
they had them in the Saint Lawrence
in Ontario for a long while,

1527
01:24:45,861 --> 01:24:49,520
but they were hunted out.
So I dunno, I unfortunately,

1528
01:24:49,521 --> 01:24:51,140
I only ever played a bleed,

1529
01:24:51,141 --> 01:24:55,010
the marine mammal expert in life and he
will eat them. Yeah. People eat them.

1530
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,530
Wow. Walrus. Yeah.

1531
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:03,160
Walruses that's so strange, man. The,

1532
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:07,820
the whole story is so sad
and disheartening. It's
so much more elaborate.

1533
01:25:07,821 --> 01:25:12,380
There's so many little details that
continue to go on. Like it's just,

1534
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,080
so this is her following me.
She's calling for me here.

1535
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:19,040
So I'm hiding around the corner and you
could see she's actually favoring her

1536
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:21,020
left flipper.
That's where she had the chemical burn.

1537
01:25:21,021 --> 01:25:23,000
This is just prior to my quitting.
Really like just months.

1538
01:25:23,001 --> 01:25:26,340
But she had a chemical burn on her leg
that was so bad. I mean her limp. Yeah.

1539
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:30,500
She's limping there because the
chemical out, I'll look at that.

1540
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:31,610
She follow me anywhere.

1541
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:36,350
That animal got to experience a semblance
of normality in the sense that I could

1542
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,930
take her out, walk her
anywhere, walk around the park.

1543
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:42,380
She got the guilt she has got,
she got to go in the snow. Right.

1544
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,080
These walruses captive.
Walrus is such an indoor facilities.

1545
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:47,600
They're never going to see the snow unless
you bring in the shovel full of snow

1546
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:52,470
and it lasts 15 minutes.
So is it only Russia that's,

1547
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:55,910
that's ganking these animals out of the
water right now that I know of. Again,

1548
01:25:55,911 --> 01:25:57,410
I can't,
I can't pretend to be an expert.

1549
01:25:57,411 --> 01:26:00,800
And it was only ever an expert in pretend
world for 12 years while I worked at

1550
01:26:00,801 --> 01:26:04,070
marine and propagated the messages
that I was fed. And now I can

1551
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:08,560
admittedly say that I know absolutely
very little about animals between black

1552
01:26:08,561 --> 01:26:10,610
fish and the cove and you know,

1553
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:13,430
things that are starting to shed light
on the treatment of these animals.

1554
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:18,260
How much of an impact do you know how
much of an impact that cove has had on the

1555
01:26:18,261 --> 01:26:21,190
Japanese? There's the
heightened awareness, which you,

1556
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:26,150
I guess you can measure its impact of
course. But politically there's a lot,

1557
01:26:26,151 --> 01:26:27,290
there's a lot of posturing going on there.

1558
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:30,650
Japan wants to say that it's part of
their culture. They don't touch that.

1559
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:33,500
But there's gotta be some financial
gain. There is something, I don't know.

1560
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:37,760
I don't want, I can't weigh into that
as far as black shit, black shit,

1561
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:40,220
black fish and everything
here. Like, yeah.

1562
01:26:40,221 --> 01:26:43,850
That awareness between the
star investigation, black
fish, everything else. Yeah.

1563
01:26:43,851 --> 01:26:47,270
People are starting to give a
shit now. Granted, it's nice to,

1564
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:51,110
it's nice to experience in the
high levels of, you know, hey,

1565
01:26:51,111 --> 01:26:53,570
we're riding the high, I'm on the
Joe Rogan show. This is great. Hey,

1566
01:26:53,571 --> 01:26:56,680
people are contributing to my
Indiegogo fund. Hey, that's great.

1567
01:26:56,681 --> 01:26:57,830
Like we're going to
get through this thing.

1568
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:02,150
There's a lot of Shitty freaking lows.
So this black fish one you want to say,

1569
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,060
this is going to make for changes.
Everything's going to be eradicated.

1570
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:09,440
Sea World's done. Look, problem solved.
It ain't that easy in six months.

1571
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:13,040
No one's talking about this after it wins.
Maybe a fricking Oscar. Who knows? But,

1572
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,680
and then that's it. I think it'll
be out there for quite a while.

1573
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:19,550
I think it will be one of
those documentaries that
gets passed around on Netflix

1574
01:27:19,551 --> 01:27:20,121
or what have you.

1575
01:27:20,121 --> 01:27:24,290
As long as it makes its
way on the internet and a
downloadable form. That's a,

1576
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:27,320
that's a pretty disturbing documentary,
man. This thing's a right hook.

1577
01:27:27,321 --> 01:27:30,530
I mean just like the star investigation
and realize it's a right hook so you

1578
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,520
know that it's going to have
some sustained like influence
and change some power.

1579
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:38,360
There's enough of this going on right
now that I think that people are,

1580
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,940
they're going to have to
come to grips. You know, I,

1581
01:27:40,941 --> 01:27:44,330
I was hoping that about factory farming
too and I still am for the future.

1582
01:27:44,331 --> 01:27:47,780
I think there's got to be come a point
in time where there's so much information

1583
01:27:47,781 --> 01:27:52,160
out there that we can get ahold of in
relation to like how our food is being

1584
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:54,920
raised, how animals are
being treated and how, again,

1585
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:58,430
the animals that don't even want to
talk about is animals. The, these,

1586
01:27:58,790 --> 01:28:03,260
these marine wizards, he's Org orcas and
dolphins. There's something different.

1587
01:28:03,261 --> 01:28:08,000
They're not just a regular animal.
There's some weird superintelligent thing.

1588
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:10,550
I think you'd find the same with a lot
of animals that were slaughtering and in

1589
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:11,660
slaughter houses too.
But again,

1590
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:14,210
I don't want to pretend that
I'm an XP and cows and takes,

1591
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:18,410
especially if they're really smart, really
intelligent pigs, eat people, you know,

1592
01:28:18,411 --> 01:28:22,460
a guy got whacked off and not whacked
off, whacked out. What is it called?

1593
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:25,880
[inaudible] and a Cecily. Um, uh, in,

1594
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:29,240
in somewhere in Italy. I don't
know if was Sicily, but they uh,

1595
01:28:29,241 --> 01:28:31,310
they threw him in a fucking pen.
The pigs ate him alive.

1596
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:35,160
So it happened on a western Canada.
Same thing. They found a farm and uh,

1597
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:36,610
that was in Vancouver,
right?

1598
01:28:36,611 --> 01:28:40,210
A serial killer that was
throwing the hookers to the
pigs, feeding them, you know.

1599
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:43,640
Yeah. They had to find like little pieces
of this and pieces of that and like,

1600
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:47,740
hmm. They're thorough
when they eat. Yeah. Yeah.

1601
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:50,300
Doesn't mean you've got to turn around
to hate him and like pound Bacon.

1602
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:52,940
The Bacon Sandwich big is delicious.
You don't,

1603
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:55,260
Higgs are not going to live forever.
I haven't eaten bacon a long time.

1604
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:59,160
Picon was definitely the
thing that I wanted to wrap
everything in Canada. I did.

1605
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:02,190
I backed, I wrapped ice cream.
Bacon. That's delicious.

1606
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:06,330
Try it. I was curing bacon wrapped.
I took an Eggo waffle. I put,

1607
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:07,560
I suppose you don't have to,

1608
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:10,050
it doesn't have to be an Eggo
waffle and they put a waffle down.

1609
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:13,840
I put a ice cream bacon,
another waffle. This,

1610
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:17,370
this is when I do know what you're doing
by this story by not being a fat guy.

1611
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,220
You fat shaming. Oh Shit. Here
we go. That's what I feel.

1612
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:24,090
I feel he's fat shaming by being able to
say this, I can eat this. What about you?

1613
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:26,130
You fat fuck with his shitty metabolism.

1614
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:29,970
Just put one slice of Bacon instead of
the eight I put and then put and I put

1615
01:29:29,971 --> 01:29:32,310
the Maple Syrup, you know,
and then I put a little,

1616
01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:35,040
I can't remember like whip
cream or something like
pounding the same. I'm like,

1617
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:37,590
wow, bacon an ice cream.
But now you're done no more.

1618
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:39,780
You can just Guinea pigs
because they're intelligent.

1619
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:45,790
Once you see what's going on there, you
can't unsee it. You can pretend to unseat,

1620
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:49,260
but at night it reminds you, well,
especially pigs that are in captivity,

1621
01:29:49,261 --> 01:29:53,670
they're so sweet. Pigs in captivity
are like really gentle souls.

1622
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,340
Pigs are strange animals,
man. They, you know,

1623
01:29:56,341 --> 01:30:00,450
I recently found out that pigs and wild
boars are essentially the same animal,

1624
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,720
the exact same animal according
to this guy, Steve Rinella,

1625
01:30:03,721 --> 01:30:05,550
who knows a lot more about
animals and I ever will.

1626
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,100
But he was saying that it's just,
we

1627
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:15,300
don't know what that is. Yeah. What is
it? I've heard that before. It's off.

1628
01:30:15,301 --> 01:30:19,410
It's a funding page. It's the video.
This one is not difficult to watch.

1629
01:30:19,411 --> 01:30:20,430
It might be worth the watch though.

1630
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:25,290
But what I was saying is that pigs
like wild pigs and domestic pigs are

1631
01:30:25,291 --> 01:30:26,280
essentially the same animal.

1632
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:30,480
And one of the weirdest things about pigs
is when you take a pig, a domestic pig,

1633
01:30:30,481 --> 01:30:33,630
when they're released into the wild,
within three weeks, they start to morph.

1634
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:36,960
They started to physically change.
Their tusks grow longer. Their nose,

1635
01:30:36,961 --> 01:30:39,030
their snout grows along
with their hair changes.

1636
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:42,810
It gets thicker and courser they
did not come within three weeks.

1637
01:30:42,811 --> 01:30:47,040
They start the metamorphosis and then
become like wild boars starts to bother me

1638
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:49,280
when the conversation comes in.
And the scientists,

1639
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:54,300
at least those that are sponsored by
a bus or they're paid for by big money

1640
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,100
start saying, oh, it's really difficult.

1641
01:30:56,101 --> 01:30:58,910
You can't re amalgamate
an animal with its family.

1642
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:02,040
Can't put an of back in the wild. They're
used to this. It can't do it. Listen,

1643
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:07,080
Orca is a kinetic, amazing machine.
Well, here's the real question.

1644
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:10,540
How have they ever tried? They did
try. They tried with Keiko, uh,

1645
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,170
free Willy Orca and it was successful.

1646
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:18,200
This animal was taken into a sea pen and
then it was eventually off on its own

1647
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:21,900
and it lived for a long time
and he would forge for food.

1648
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:24,960
He interacted with other orcas.
He got intimidated by those orchids.

1649
01:31:24,961 --> 01:31:27,060
I mean it was probably a
little bit of a lonely journey,

1650
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:29,190
but you've got to learn a great deal of,

1651
01:31:29,191 --> 01:31:33,150
of his life in the wild is reintegration.
And it was, it was a glaring success.

1652
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:37,500
He did eventually die. Uh, but
nonetheless, I mean on all or,

1653
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:40,680
cause eventually they all die. A lot of,
a lot of people like your your see will.

1654
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,320
People are going to be like, well
he died. He died over there. Well,

1655
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,430
how long did he live? I can't
remember exactly. Again, I can't,

1656
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:50,040
I can't pretend to be an expert.
I read this,

1657
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:52,470
I'll propagate this and
I'll tell you things,

1658
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:55,140
but I don't think it has to do with the
longevity of how long you lived there as

1659
01:31:55,141 --> 01:31:58,350
much as the quality of life, but that
does sound like a scapegoat way of saying,

1660
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:00,190
well,
he died early or

1661
01:32:00,570 --> 01:32:04,300
soon after buck. The wildest fucking
harsh man. It's harsh for everything.

1662
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:08,620
Very few animals. You know what I was
talking about deer earlier when you,

1663
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:11,920
you find a deer that's five years old,
that's a fucking old deer.

1664
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:16,120
It's very rare that a deer gets to be
five years old and it's not just because

1665
01:32:16,121 --> 01:32:19,510
of hunters. It's because of predators
and freezing to death, freezing to death.

1666
01:32:19,511 --> 01:32:22,480
It's like the number one
cause of death for a mule.

1667
01:32:22,481 --> 01:32:26,080
Deer deer that live in Montana,
they fucking freeze to death, man.

1668
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,870
Before the coyotes get them,
before anything happens, like shit,

1669
01:32:28,871 --> 01:32:31,810
it's cold as fuck and they're not going
to make it so they have to fuck like

1670
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:35,860
crazy and shoot as many of them out there
as possible and hopefully a couple of

1671
01:32:35,861 --> 01:32:39,070
them will make it to next year and then
they fucked like crazy and keep going.

1672
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,610
That's the only way or cause or
different man they like. I would,

1673
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:46,120
I would imagine the ocean to be a pure
utopia. Pure and imagining, right.

1674
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:49,060
I mean especially if they're in like
Alaska, they're the top somewhere.

1675
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:50,620
They're top cheese.
They don't worry about anything.

1676
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:53,740
They had dolphins that's lead anything.
They do kill dolphins.

1677
01:32:53,741 --> 01:32:56,380
It's Kinda fucked up. Fuck the
ORCAS. They killed dolphins,

1678
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:59,770
but it's kind of fucked up. I mean
it's really kind of, that's one,

1679
01:32:59,771 --> 01:33:02,410
one of the weird things
about life is that it's the,

1680
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:07,510
one of the major reasons why even Stephen
Hawking's has said that if there were

1681
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,680
some sort of an alien invasion from an
intelligent species from another galaxy

1682
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:12,514
or what have you,

1683
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:17,110
we really should be concerned because
if we just look at the way we treat

1684
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:19,120
animals that are lesser than us,

1685
01:33:19,121 --> 01:33:23,950
that we can control and look at the way
every other animal from chimpanzees to

1686
01:33:23,951 --> 01:33:28,150
monkeys to everything finds things in.
Either fucks it or eats it.

1687
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:31,810
Everything's slower, are dumber
than it. It put it in prisons.

1688
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:36,640
It fucks or at eats and that's what
we've done. That's what chimpanzees do.

1689
01:33:36,641 --> 01:33:41,170
That's what dolphins do. Dolphins
kill baby dolphins on a regular basis?

1690
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:44,440
I don't know about that. They
do. They do come on the males,

1691
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,020
the males try to displace
the cast for the females.

1692
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:50,440
They get a pregnant yet super common.
Right? They're really horny though.

1693
01:33:50,441 --> 01:33:54,170
These are like peak times and Horniness,
right? It's okay to kill babies.

1694
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:56,050
There's a,
there's a brief period where they're like,

1695
01:33:56,110 --> 01:33:59,320
well I mean or cause in captivity
are banging their daughters. Right.

1696
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:02,320
That's that peak of of Supreme Horny.
This we don't know.

1697
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:04,810
That's a big difference between that
we're talking about in the wild.

1698
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:09,310
That's one of the reasons why female
dolphin promiscuity is so at such a high

1699
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:09,700
rate.

1700
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:12,910
I think we have to get worried if a
orchids grow legs because they're the ones

1701
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:16,660
that are going on motherfuckers for
sure. I'm sure. Right? Fingers and legs.

1702
01:34:16,661 --> 01:34:19,370
They figured out how to wait to get
out of the water. We're done. My God.

1703
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:21,700
Hopefully I'm on their good
side. Smart. An enormous,

1704
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:24,100
if they could live in Seattle
where it rains all the time.

1705
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:27,120
Just run through the streets
every time it was a rainstorm.

1706
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:28,180
You got to bolt on your doors.

1707
01:34:28,181 --> 01:34:30,610
She's orchids are going to be running
through the streets looking to fuck people

1708
01:34:30,611 --> 01:34:31,720
up or cause they're nice though.

1709
01:34:31,721 --> 01:34:34,540
I think that you could probably like
it's the new shark Nedo like the new

1710
01:34:34,541 --> 01:34:37,390
Godzilla like baby Godzilla or go running.
Yeah.

1711
01:34:37,391 --> 01:34:39,640
Every time it's raining everybody
has a fucking bolt or door down.

1712
01:34:39,641 --> 01:34:42,700
Cause orkis they only need like six
inches of water and they start running.

1713
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,950
They just need to be wet.
They don't even need a new water.

1714
01:34:44,951 --> 01:34:49,270
They just need to be wet.
They did develop pause on their arm,

1715
01:34:49,271 --> 01:34:50,104
stretch out.

1716
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:54,460
They just go into cocoons and then
they pop out with arms and legs.

1717
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:56,980
It's better learn how to do back
flips for whatever you like to.

1718
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:01,310
Yeah, but we have gun and shit.
I think it would be a slaughter.

1719
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:04,340
They'd run down the street.
We just tagging them off,
but how many of them are,

1720
01:35:04,341 --> 01:35:06,800
they're really, we don't know
what's common bringing it bitch,

1721
01:35:07,210 --> 01:35:10,820
we don't know and the depths of the ocean.
They, we got jet son, we've got jets,

1722
01:35:10,821 --> 01:35:13,970
we can fly. We can fly and shoot
hellfire missiles down at town.

1723
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,610
They're working on a factory
down there to come bring it,

1724
01:35:16,611 --> 01:35:19,310
come bring it a mental
fuck us the whole time.

1725
01:35:19,311 --> 01:35:21,590
Then all of a sudden we're
like putting guns on ourselves.

1726
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:23,750
Probably are by being super sweet.

1727
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,990
That's how they're mentally fucking us
by making us look like what piece of

1728
01:35:26,991 --> 01:35:29,480
shits we really are. I'll give a
shit now they're onto something.

1729
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:32,930
They know what they're doing. Yeah. Well
I think, you know, as we said before,

1730
01:35:32,931 --> 01:35:35,000
I think that the more
the information gets out,

1731
01:35:35,001 --> 01:35:39,320
the more the reality of the situation
becomes into focus and not just for the

1732
01:35:39,321 --> 01:35:42,680
protected few that knew before but
couldn't do anything because you were

1733
01:35:42,681 --> 01:35:47,600
financially beholden to the one person
or people that own whatever organization

1734
01:35:47,730 --> 01:35:49,820
contains these animals and imprisons them.

1735
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:53,180
And the reality of the situation as
it becomes more and more aware to you,

1736
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:57,800
you know, as you go from being this kid
who's like got this great idea, like, wow,

1737
01:35:57,801 --> 01:36:02,480
I can't believe I'm here. Hold on
up. Killer whales TV. What a dream.

1738
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:04,640
Two years later, like, Holy Shit,

1739
01:36:04,641 --> 01:36:07,040
I'm a part of an animal
prison or not even an animal.

1740
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:10,010
I'm a part of an
intelligent things prison.

1741
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:14,810
I can't feel a lot of
guilt for being there.

1742
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:18,800
I didn't pluck them out of the ocean,
so I feel like maybe,

1743
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:21,650
maybe I'm atoning for that
guilt of like shit man,

1744
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:23,560
but doing a really good job in,

1745
01:36:23,870 --> 01:36:26,000
in the facility and trying
to care for the animals.

1746
01:36:26,001 --> 01:36:29,000
It's hard to feel guilt for doing that.
I don't think you should feel guilt.

1747
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:31,760
I don't think guilt any good.
Right.

1748
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:33,680
I mean the people that are
part of something or the
ones that are paying at the

1749
01:36:33,681 --> 01:36:38,190
gate, that's what needs to stop. Yes.
The only thing that guilt helps it.

1750
01:36:38,191 --> 01:36:41,630
Guilt helps you realize you're doing
something wrong, getting a bad feeling,

1751
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:43,970
you realize you're doing something
wrong and hopefully correct it.

1752
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:47,720
That's the only thing that guilt
really does. Other than that,

1753
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:51,740
you know you haven't guilt for working
there, especially coming into it. No,

1754
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:52,461
not knowing.

1755
01:36:52,461 --> 01:36:56,510
Being a young guy who had these idealistic
visions of what it was like to work

1756
01:36:56,511 --> 01:37:01,100
at a marine animals facility and trained
killer whales and Shit and then you get

1757
01:37:01,101 --> 01:37:05,030
there and you realize the reality of it.
Like that's just a part of, you know,

1758
01:37:05,150 --> 01:37:09,200
you realizing the world is complicated.
It's just, that's your version of it.

1759
01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:13,550
The overwhelming guilt was that I'm
not doing anything to stop this.

1760
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:16,490
It wasn't an participating in this.
It's I got to do something.

1761
01:37:16,491 --> 01:37:19,100
Who's going to do something? I was
going to do something. Okay, fuck it.

1762
01:37:19,101 --> 01:37:22,400
Use My name, use my face Sumi for
millions. Get my girlfriend fired.

1763
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:25,310
We're going to live in cardboard
boxes student. Great. Did you,

1764
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:27,830
what's like when you went into this,
what was like,

1765
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,590
what's the worst case scenario? If
you want, you just think about it.

1766
01:37:30,610 --> 01:37:32,540
Do you just think about it?
Like, did you like say, okay,

1767
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:35,150
what's the worst that this can do to me?

1768
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:39,560
What you wind up in jail when you wind
up in prison where you wind up in debt,

1769
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:41,300
obviously. I wonder, yeah,

1770
01:37:41,301 --> 01:37:45,440
I guess the anxiety was like subside
of the great deal once the resolve was

1771
01:37:45,441 --> 01:37:45,621
there,

1772
01:37:45,621 --> 01:37:48,410
but that was only because I saw smooshing
like take that out of the equation.

1773
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:49,580
I don't know that necessarily.

1774
01:37:49,581 --> 01:37:54,070
I would have at least had as as much a
hand in like allowing myself to, you know,

1775
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:58,020
be a part of investigation.
He uses the name and face of course,

1776
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:03,300
but that,
that guilt and everything else that fog,

1777
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,010
you don't think rationally like,

1778
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,250
well maybe I should just
back away and not try to,

1779
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:12,960
to change the status quo because hey,
this could be at great risk. I mean,

1780
01:38:12,961 --> 01:38:15,600
of course, you know, you're going to
take a shit kicking, you know, you know,

1781
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:18,960
you know there's going to be a recourse.
I don't care.

1782
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:21,390
I don't want smooshy to
die. Right. You know,

1783
01:38:21,391 --> 01:38:22,710
you've gotta put yourself in their shoes.
It's like,

1784
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:26,670
what are you willing
to do for this animal?

1785
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:30,210
And I hate to call it animal, but this,
this being that you share this bond with,

1786
01:38:30,211 --> 01:38:32,040
what do you,
what lengths are you willing to go?

1787
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:35,700
I decided I'm willing to stick my neck
out. Well, that's very admirable, man.

1788
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,620
It really is. You know,
the, the whole mean you,

1789
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:41,160
you're doing what the hero
does and the story, right?

1790
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:46,020
And confronted with an inescapable
truth. You Act and uh, you know,

1791
01:38:46,021 --> 01:38:49,320
and especially emotionally in your case,

1792
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:53,970
you being so attached to this one animal,
you know, literally it's mom to it.

1793
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:58,530
That's gotta be a really strange time,
you know,

1794
01:38:58,531 --> 01:39:01,920
to know that you're right and know that
your instincts are correct and you're

1795
01:39:01,921 --> 01:39:03,540
acting on the best interest of the animal,

1796
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:08,060
but it facing this intense
amount of opposition. It's mean,

1797
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:11,230
it's classic hero story. I mean, I'm
just trying to get the happy ending, man.

1798
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:14,850
You're obviously the good guy, good
guy, and every one of those stories.

1799
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,710
I mean in that classic story,
you're obviously the good
guy. I don't know whether,

1800
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:22,710
I mean you might be crazy. You might've
made most of this up. No fun up there.

1801
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:25,290
I've done that.
[inaudible] telling me the shit.

1802
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:29,770
We're going to play the video man, relax
this, this pacing man, he got, it's,

1803
01:39:29,850 --> 01:39:32,780
this is an art to this as
this is Hollywood man. I
would've, I know Hollywood.

1804
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:35,880
This is fucking Canoga Park
sons is nowhere near Hollywood.

1805
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:41,100
It's a long ways from Chippewa and
Niagara Falls. Well because it's warm out.

1806
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:44,040
It's just a bunch of people. Dude, you
Canadians kind of get over that shit.

1807
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:46,020
Scary place.
The states man and that,

1808
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:49,350
I mean all of a sudden you come in and
you guys got like big roads and stuff.

1809
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:52,030
Is that what it is? That big
roads coming out? Big Role.

1810
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,410
Our books and big word cards are shiny.
They're not rusty either. It's amazing.

1811
01:39:55,411 --> 01:39:56,760
I'm looking around going,
wait, where's the rust?

1812
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,280
Because you're used to people that
are traveling around with salt.

1813
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:02,250
I had a jeep ratchet that,
yeah, when I lived in Boston,

1814
01:40:02,251 --> 01:40:05,610
every car had fucking big rust holes and
the quarter panels he could poke your

1815
01:40:05,611 --> 01:40:08,880
finger through right where
the wheel went. Yeah. Yeah.

1816
01:40:08,881 --> 01:40:11,160
Don't be cheap if you're in a,
if you're in Canada.

1817
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:13,350
And what was the thing that
I heard about jeeps recently?

1818
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:18,330
There was some sort of a, an issue about
recalls that, did you hear about this?

1819
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:21,750
I didn't know. I was lucky to sell mine.
Actually. I, I made a deal with a guy,

1820
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:24,040
he was like three k certified.
I'm like, yeah, no problem.

1821
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:27,060
I look at certified for sure. I'd take
it to the shop guys like k hole here,

1822
01:40:27,061 --> 01:40:30,310
a whole here, this, that 4,000 of fixed.
I'm like, Oh man, I'm in deep shit.

1823
01:40:30,311 --> 01:40:34,170
And there there's a fuel tank.
Recall for jeeps, Bentleys,

1824
01:40:34,171 --> 01:40:37,170
Lamborghinis and Nissans.
Oh, this is like,

1825
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:42,030
they're all being made by
the same place. Um, no, no,

1826
01:40:42,031 --> 01:40:45,600
obviously not. Right. Well, this
is what's confusing. The recall,

1827
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:48,690
widespread recall jeeps to Lamborghini's.
So serious range.

1828
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:50,820
Maybe they it was the same
tank or something like that.

1829
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:54,040
I mean the type of tank I
could see you don't need

1830
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,930
like a high end tank
to be in a Lamborghini,

1831
01:40:55,931 --> 01:40:58,750
although it would be a very
different shape. You know,

1832
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:01,900
the different shapes for different calls
or just somebody who had brought this

1833
01:41:01,901 --> 01:41:04,390
up and I wasn't aware of it.
Some sort of a recall.

1834
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:09,460
Icer says the trailer hitches will
protect the gas tanks which are mounted

1835
01:41:09,461 --> 01:41:12,370
behind the rear axle and are
vulnerable to rear impacts.

1836
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:15,730
Although Kreisler told the agency that
a trailer hitch cannot and will not

1837
01:41:15,731 --> 01:41:18,550
mitigate the risk of high
energy rear car collisions,

1838
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:22,810
but would incrementally improve the
performance in certain types of low speed

1839
01:41:22,811 --> 01:41:27,130
impacts. Boy, that doesn't make me feel
comfortable. The most hilarious shit.

1840
01:41:27,131 --> 01:41:29,710
Those those Teslas,
you know those Tesla ss,

1841
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:33,130
one of the drivers is like a
big dolphin. A advocate. What?

1842
01:41:33,131 --> 01:41:35,030
Ilan Musk the guy because she's a woman.

1843
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:38,320
Laelani Mun Munter there's a
lot of people that own them now.

1844
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:41,290
They're pretty common, but they've
had three of them burst into flames.

1845
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:46,300
I heard about that. Yeah, I apparently,
I mean it's a brilliant car. It's one,

1846
01:41:46,301 --> 01:41:50,260
many car. The years it's like
environmentally friendly. Well sort of.

1847
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:53,740
Well that's the, I think they're pushing
that sort of sort of here's the issue.

1848
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:58,390
They're all this conflict minerals in
every lithium ion battery when you're

1849
01:41:58,391 --> 01:42:00,130
getting lithium ion batteries,
if,

1850
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:04,120
unless you absolutely are completely
sure of where that lithium was sourced.

1851
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:07,960
You're getting lithium from Afghanistan,
you're getting lithium from the Congo,

1852
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:10,840
you're getting lithium from some really
dark places where there's a lot of

1853
01:42:10,841 --> 01:42:14,390
people that are running the show that
are cunts and when you know when you,

1854
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,020
it's one of the things about cell phones,

1855
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:18,910
one of the darkest things about computers,

1856
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:23,200
the very minerals that are used to run
your computer and your cell phones,

1857
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:27,370
those are being pulled out of the ground
in certain places by essentially slaves.

1858
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:29,830
They're being pulled out
by little kids in some way.

1859
01:42:29,831 --> 01:42:33,340
I mean maybe they've cleaned that up in
some places because this stuff has been

1860
01:42:33,341 --> 01:42:34,174
exposed,

1861
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:38,650
but the Congo is notorious for being like
a really terrible place when it comes

1862
01:42:38,651 --> 01:42:39,490
to human rights.

1863
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:44,220
Vice magazine has done several pieces
on the Congo and you know how it,

1864
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:45,610
how it runs down there.

1865
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:50,560
Like I saw like tourism piece of vice
magazine actually placed magazine wrote an

1866
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:53,920
article on marina and that
still is the best damn article.

1867
01:42:53,921 --> 01:42:56,860
I mean they're the shit man. Oh yeah,
they're awesome. Oh, by the way,

1868
01:42:56,861 --> 01:43:01,861
I had Eddie Wong and Shane Smith or
coming back on together on the 18th.

1869
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:04,930
It's going to be a party in here
and were told to bring booze.

1870
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:08,020
So I don't see what happens.
But Eddie Wong and Shane Smith together,

1871
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:11,650
Shit could be epic. Yeah. They'd go
everywhere and expose everything.

1872
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:15,610
And you know what's beautiful about
vices that they have. Here's another one.

1873
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:21,010
This is my favorite one though. The
electric cars, uh, they, the Fisker Karma,

1874
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,760
those Fisker, you know, those things are,
those are those really beautiful ones.

1875
01:43:24,761 --> 01:43:27,310
They have a solar panel on the roof,

1876
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:31,120
so the solar panel actually
charges up your radio and uh,

1877
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:33,670
like your dashboard and you're
displaying everything like that.

1878
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:36,840
It's like a supplemental
charge. Sure. Like, well,

1879
01:43:37,410 --> 01:43:40,720
well they're really cool
looking car, but they, uh,

1880
01:43:40,721 --> 01:43:45,721
they park them on the docks and during
the hurricane they fucking burst into

1881
01:43:45,821 --> 01:43:50,680
flames when they got wet.
I serious. Yes, yes. Yeah.

1882
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:54,530
They fucking burst into flames, man.
You'd have that at least that tested like,

1883
01:43:54,531 --> 01:43:58,160
well, how was it when it's wet? Yeah.
I don't know. That's not good though.

1884
01:43:58,310 --> 01:44:00,020
Like what happened to that Porsche?
You know,

1885
01:44:00,021 --> 01:44:04,100
the one that Brian or that guy
from the movies died in? Oh,

1886
01:44:04,101 --> 01:44:09,070
the Carrera Gt Paul Walker died and
that's a very dangerous car, isn't it?

1887
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:12,050
Yeah, it's a slippery
car. Um, Walter Role,

1888
01:44:12,051 --> 01:44:16,660
who is a world famous race car
driver, like he's been the, the,

1889
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:21,260
the head test driver for Porsche
forever. You could see Walter role. Um,

1890
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:25,310
you could see his, uh, his videos
of him driving all over youtube.

1891
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:30,460
The guys who's super talented and
incredibly good at driving race cars.

1892
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:35,360
And he got out of the career gt and
he was like, that car scared me.

1893
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:39,830
This is a scary car. Too much power,
too weird with its handling. I mean,

1894
01:44:39,831 --> 01:44:44,690
it's a mid engine car. It's very dynamic,
incredibly powerful. 500 horsepower, very,

1895
01:44:44,691 --> 01:44:48,970
very light. And uh, he felt like at
the limit he couldn't figure out,

1896
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:50,110
but he said they,

1897
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:53,360
they drove it in the wet one of the first
times he drove it and he was terrified.

1898
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:55,670
He said that the button,
the car needed two buttons,

1899
01:44:55,671 --> 01:44:57,230
one for the wet and one for the dry.

1900
01:44:57,410 --> 01:45:01,640
There's been quite a few accidents in
that car and including Jay Leno spun his

1901
01:45:01,641 --> 01:45:05,450
out at Talladega. He has a, he has
a Carrera gt, he has like, you know,

1902
01:45:05,451 --> 01:45:09,050
a hundred fucking cars, but he had
this Carerra gt spin out on him.

1903
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:13,190
Jay Leno knows how to drive
fucking cars tire well as,

1904
01:45:13,191 --> 01:45:16,700
as this guy who was driving the car that
Paul Walker died and the guy was a race

1905
01:45:16,701 --> 01:45:19,700
car driver.
He wasn't just like a regular slow,

1906
01:45:19,970 --> 01:45:23,750
he really knew how to drive cars.
So I think it's one of those cars,

1907
01:45:23,751 --> 01:45:28,610
it's just super powerful and
like you have to really mind it.

1908
01:45:28,611 --> 01:45:31,610
You have to be really careful
of it. There's, you know,

1909
01:45:31,611 --> 01:45:34,850
there's certain cars that
they probably shouldn't exist.

1910
01:45:34,851 --> 01:45:36,650
Like the Mustang has a car out now,

1911
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:42,100
Shelby gt 500 it has
670 fucking horsepower.

1912
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:47,390
It's insane and I don't even
think it has 11 inch wide tires.

1913
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:50,630
I mean they're not that
wide and this fucking thing.

1914
01:45:50,631 --> 01:45:54,170
I had the GT 500 from the previous years.

1915
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:56,630
It had 550 horsepower.
It was ridiculous.

1916
01:45:56,900 --> 01:46:00,110
I couldn't imagine that someone had
that thing and said, do you know what?

1917
01:46:00,111 --> 01:46:03,950
This fucking thing needs another
hundred and 10 120 horsepower.

1918
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:06,950
See the problem I have with these cars
and these these bikes is like if you

1919
01:46:06,951 --> 01:46:11,690
could like change the unused horsepower
though is probably you'll never use into

1920
01:46:11,691 --> 01:46:15,410
like value these vehicles that
are priced way. The hell up here.

1921
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:19,220
I really only worth like you could pay
12,000 bucks for a Mustang because the

1922
01:46:19,221 --> 01:46:23,390
rest of the power that you'll never be
able to use or explore doesn't exist.

1923
01:46:23,391 --> 01:46:25,760
Like take it out of the
equation, you know? Yeah.

1924
01:46:25,761 --> 01:46:27,080
But who the fuck things like that.

1925
01:46:27,290 --> 01:46:30,520
That's one of the cool things about those
cars is that you have that power son.

1926
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:33,640
Yes, you can. You get on the onramp, you

1927
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:39,690
accelerate to 60 miles an hour
legally in three seconds. Well,

1928
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:41,270
that's what I'm saying.
That's legal. Okay,

1929
01:46:41,271 --> 01:46:42,980
so within those three
seconds then there's value,

1930
01:46:42,981 --> 01:46:45,820
but there's still so much
unused potential. They're fun.

1931
01:46:45,821 --> 01:46:48,620
You're thinking like an accountant and
that's not what these cars are all about.

1932
01:46:48,621 --> 01:46:51,180
Especially cars.
Muscle cars are all about emotion.

1933
01:46:51,210 --> 01:46:53,580
It's all about the sound of
the rumble of the engine.

1934
01:46:53,581 --> 01:46:54,900
Even if you're not going fast,

1935
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:58,410
like if you buy an old muscle car
that those things are terrible.

1936
01:46:58,411 --> 01:47:02,340
They drive like shit. They fucking handle
horrible. Every corner you go around,

1937
01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:05,130
there's no aerodynamics.
The breaks are dog shit.

1938
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,320
Unless you upgrade everything
to modern standards,

1939
01:47:07,321 --> 01:47:11,580
you're dealing with a fucking disaster.
But it'll put a big fat,

1940
01:47:11,581 --> 01:47:13,670
stupid smile on your face when
you drive one of the stuff.

1941
01:47:13,671 --> 01:47:15,510
But these crotch rockets though,
I mean your first gear,

1942
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:17,880
you're a half twist on the wrist
and you're, you're already like,

1943
01:47:17,881 --> 01:47:18,930
don't go through a school zone him.

1944
01:47:18,930 --> 01:47:21,900
He came and start this thing through a
school zone without giving up on the back

1945
01:47:21,901 --> 01:47:25,920
tire. Well, yeah, I mean
they're ridiculous. The
amount of power is ridiculous.

1946
01:47:25,921 --> 01:47:30,330
Nobody needs it, but people like it.
They like it. You know, California,

1947
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,260
it's even scarier.

1948
01:47:31,261 --> 01:47:33,990
The bikes are even scarier than
the cars because they're so light.

1949
01:47:33,991 --> 01:47:36,540
It's such a small object that's hurling.

1950
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:39,770
I remember going through a school zone
and it's like, I'm just blah, blah, blah,

1951
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:42,460
blah, blah. On one of these
I've Katherine, it was like
a six or 900 something.

1952
01:47:42,510 --> 01:47:44,520
One of them up, up, up. I looked
down, it's like 70 clicks,

1953
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:48,120
kilometers an hour in Canada. Holy
Shit. Like at least my license.

1954
01:47:48,121 --> 01:47:49,680
If I'm caught doing this,
I'm just going bump.

1955
01:47:49,681 --> 01:47:51,700
I'm trying to be as nice as possible.
Yeah.

1956
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:54,360
They're so fast and you're so tuned in.

1957
01:47:54,361 --> 01:47:56,310
When you drive something
that's that fast all the time.

1958
01:47:56,311 --> 01:47:59,220
He's so tuned in to speed. You
know? You're so tuned into that.

1959
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:02,530
All that crazy shit car becomes,

1960
01:48:03,050 --> 01:48:05,610
it becomes when it becomes an extension
of your body once you're in the zone.

1961
01:48:05,611 --> 01:48:08,160
Right. You gotta know your shit
though. Is that Jay Leno spinning out?

1962
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:13,280
Did he hit the wall? No, it
looks, it looks like he hit
something man, right? Yeah,

1963
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:15,090
he hit me.
Holy Shit.

1964
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:17,613
Yeah.
Those are

1965
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:23,410
what caused the splitter.
This,

1966
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:27,410
they're fucking tricky cars, man. Just
like that. Just let it go. Just let go.

1967
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:29,530
He was obviously turning.
You can see he's turning,

1968
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:31,270
it'll hit the wall

1969
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:36,540
when you drive in a car like that,
he's okay. He didn't hit the walls.

1970
01:48:36,541 --> 01:48:38,020
That would have said no,
I guess. No, I guess it,

1971
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:40,200
it's a half a million dollar car too,
by the way.

1972
01:48:40,201 --> 01:48:42,380
I say they're probably worried
about the car too. Right? Well,

1973
01:48:42,381 --> 01:48:46,850
when you're driving a car like that, the,
the amount of traction that you have,

1974
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:52,540
there's so much power and you're dealing
with the tires have to keep up with

1975
01:48:53,781 --> 01:48:56,680
what the engine can do.
Makes sense and you have to mitigate that.

1976
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:58,760
You have to be able to balance
that out in a good race.

1977
01:48:58,761 --> 01:49:02,360
Car driver knows where the limits of the
tires are and also when you get onto a

1978
01:49:02,361 --> 01:49:05,780
track, the tires aren't at their peak
immediately. You might need five,

1979
01:49:05,781 --> 01:49:09,350
six laps warm to warm up the tires so
you get to get to the temperature of the

1980
01:49:09,351 --> 01:49:11,630
tires is very critical to performance.

1981
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:15,310
Especially when you're dealing with like
cop tires and these fat slicks that a

1982
01:49:15,311 --> 01:49:17,180
lot of these race car
drivers drive around on.

1983
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:21,500
So the whole deal is about putting heat
into those tires and until you have that

1984
01:49:21,501 --> 01:49:25,460
or if the conditions are bad or if
it's rained within the last 48 hours,

1985
01:49:25,461 --> 01:49:28,620
all those have big factors on the amount
of traction that you have on that,

1986
01:49:28,621 --> 01:49:32,900
not to think about and getting behind it.
That's nice. Nice thing about the jeep.

1987
01:49:32,901 --> 01:49:35,200
It's just bup, bup, bup,
bup, bup, bup. Mean.

1988
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:37,610
Obviously we were just talking
about race cars. Most cars,

1989
01:49:37,611 --> 01:49:38,930
these things don't come into factor,

1990
01:49:38,931 --> 01:49:43,250
but what does come into play is that
the lessons learned from these cars,

1991
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:46,700
these cars going really fast around race
tracks. People think it's ridiculous,

1992
01:49:46,701 --> 01:49:49,780
but why would you need that? Why
do you, you don't, you're right,

1993
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:53,890
absolutely shits and giggles. This sport,
it's for shits and giggles. It's a hobby.

1994
01:49:53,891 --> 01:49:54,611
It's a pastime.

1995
01:49:54,611 --> 01:49:59,611
But the lessons learned from these races
are exactly why today's cars are so

1996
01:50:00,221 --> 01:50:02,890
safe that today's cars handles so well.

1997
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:06,020
They're so aerodynamically sound there.
There,

1998
01:50:06,021 --> 01:50:09,070
there are zero to 60 times have
dropped steadily every year.

1999
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:12,220
It's all because of the improvements
that they made because the motor sports,

2000
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:16,690
like if you look at like Porsche has um,
they have a Panamera,

2001
01:50:16,691 --> 01:50:19,990
you know what that is? They have
a four door car, they have a big,

2002
01:50:20,020 --> 01:50:23,680
it's like a big like Mercedes looking
thing, big spaceship looking thing.

2003
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:26,980
I've seen like the, I've seen like
the, they've got to almost an SUV.

2004
01:50:26,981 --> 01:50:31,300
Look at Porsche, that's a Cayenne. They
have those cars that they have now.

2005
01:50:31,301 --> 01:50:35,320
They fucking defy physics. These things
are insane. When you drive one of them,

2006
01:50:35,321 --> 01:50:39,490
the engineering involved in
these 500 plus horsepower,

2007
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:40,450
twin turbo,

2008
01:50:40,451 --> 01:50:44,470
5,000 pound vehicles or whatever the fuck
they way it's well over 4,000 pounds.

2009
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:46,990
It's,
it's shocking when you drive,

2010
01:50:46,991 --> 01:50:50,230
you can't believe how they handle
all that's from motor sports.

2011
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:53,590
All that's from the lessons they learned
in engineering and trying things out,

2012
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:56,740
doing things like, you
know, like 24 hour races,

2013
01:50:56,890 --> 01:51:01,150
the little Oman's races and all the gt
races that Porsche gets involved in.

2014
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:03,730
They learn all that.
They learn from those mistakes.

2015
01:51:03,731 --> 01:51:07,480
And how to improve those fast cars and
then the apply those lessons to their

2016
01:51:07,481 --> 01:51:09,100
regular cars,
their consumer cars,

2017
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:13,420
and they also apply it more so or at least
a great deal on the shits and giggles

2018
01:51:13,421 --> 01:51:15,820
factor because that's what, that's
where they're getting off. I mean,

2019
01:51:15,821 --> 01:51:17,290
making these things big.

2020
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:20,830
It doesn't address a lot of people's like
I'm never going to drive one of these

2021
01:51:20,831 --> 01:51:23,860
things. Yeah, it's awesome that that
guy could, I can't drive that. Well,

2022
01:51:23,861 --> 01:51:26,470
they're getting,
they're getting a Nunes insane levels.

2023
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:29,200
Why don't just put wings on these
things. They're flying. They can't,

2024
01:51:29,201 --> 01:51:31,270
that's not legal yet,
but when you get into,

2025
01:51:31,271 --> 01:51:34,930
when you start talking about like a
performance levels like zero to 60 levels,

2026
01:51:35,110 --> 01:51:36,730
like just 10 20 years ago,

2027
01:51:36,731 --> 01:51:40,690
if you get a car to zero to 60 in
four seconds would be crazy. Like wow,

2028
01:51:40,691 --> 01:51:45,670
zero to 60 in four seconds. You could get
that in a Mustang gt. It costs 35 grand.

2029
01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:49,720
I mean a regular car that you buy can
Mustang gt almost a zero to 60 in four

2030
01:51:49,721 --> 01:51:52,720
seconds. It might be like four or five
at the most, half a second slower.

2031
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:57,880
It's crazy. The performance. They've
got a [inaudible], a Porsche, um,

2032
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:58,241
uh,

2033
01:51:58,241 --> 01:52:03,241
the turbo s the nine 11 turbo s the
new one goes zero to 60 in 2.7 seconds.

2034
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:09,730
Where do you have to be in to
take 2.7 seconds to get, I mean,

2035
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:13,150
that's great for fireman. I don't want
to say police necessarily, but you can't,

2036
01:52:13,210 --> 01:52:16,120
obviously it's tough to get
fire gear in a Porsche nine 11,

2037
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:19,840
but what's going to be, what's going
to happen in a hundred years from now?

2038
01:52:19,841 --> 01:52:23,150
Is it going to be zero to 60 instantly?
Are we going to like warp thread?

2039
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:26,440
It's going to be at different means
of transportation altogether. Really?

2040
01:52:26,441 --> 01:52:28,810
Look what, yeah. Wormholes. Like you say,

2041
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,780
I dunno what transponders
with the Pipi gone. Yeah.

2042
01:52:31,781 --> 01:52:33,340
I guess if we never saw
the internet coming,

2043
01:52:33,341 --> 01:52:37,090
we're not going to see the next thing
coming either. You know, evolution,

2044
01:52:37,091 --> 01:52:39,610
everything's evolving.
Where I'm holes in your car,

2045
01:52:39,730 --> 01:52:42,910
you're going to press a button, you're
going to show up in the office right now.

2046
01:52:42,911 --> 01:52:46,130
The fastest way to get somewhere
to keep shit at though all

2047
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:47,420
got to work from home now boom,

2048
01:52:47,580 --> 01:52:51,020
so you have a 60 I think the fact that
you could send files through the mail,

2049
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:54,170
through email,
you could send files through online.

2050
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,850
Drones are now going to
start dropping shit off.

2051
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,980
You're not going to have to go
to that many places anymore.

2052
01:52:58,190 --> 01:52:59,990
I think actually physically going places.

2053
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:03,920
I think we're going to be trapped
at home looking at monitors all day,

2054
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:06,050
talking to each other,
face to face through these things.

2055
01:53:06,051 --> 01:53:10,460
Can 99% of my friends already.
Where do you think this,

2056
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:15,050
this whole controversy and lawsuit, where
do you think this takes you? Do you,

2057
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:18,740
do you have like an end game here?
Do you have like a an escape clause?

2058
01:53:18,741 --> 01:53:21,470
Do you have like a way that
you can so get out of this,

2059
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:25,310
it's a slap suit to strategic
lawsuit against public participation.

2060
01:53:25,311 --> 01:53:29,600
The idea is he launches the suit. I
shut the hell up. The suit goes nowhere.

2061
01:53:29,601 --> 01:53:34,220
He had their backs at the hell
off or he bleeds me dry phone.

2062
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:36,500
I got, I'm out of funds. I don't
get a choice in the matter.

2063
01:53:36,501 --> 01:53:38,820
I signed a piece of paper saying,
I'm not going to bother you in more.

2064
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:39,321
I'm never going to talk.

2065
01:53:39,321 --> 01:53:43,730
And if somebody wants to Google your
whatever it is to Gogo, what does it save?

2066
01:53:43,731 --> 01:53:48,731
smooshy.com save smooshy.com
so I'll smooshy you should
probably smell smoke a s

2067
01:53:50,001 --> 01:53:54,350
M o. O. S. H. I. So this is
the fourth campaign that we've,

2068
01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:55,011
that I've launched.

2069
01:53:55,011 --> 01:54:00,011
I've basically raised about $40,000 and
then there was that Billy challenge that

2070
01:54:01,161 --> 01:54:05,150
I think you spoke to Les Stroud a boat.
Yes. Less speaks very highly of you,

2071
01:54:05,151 --> 01:54:08,000
which is why you're here. Thanks
les. Les is a great guy and he's,

2072
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:11,690
he's an awesome guy. He's my homeboy
last one. A long ways to try to help us.

2073
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:15,770
We won through less.
We won $32,000 Canadian one day.

2074
01:54:15,771 --> 01:54:18,650
I'm sitting there talking about initiating
payment with the guy like, okay,

2075
01:54:18,651 --> 01:54:20,600
we're flying this guy or this
guy guy's being flown down.

2076
01:54:20,601 --> 01:54:21,740
We're going to have a big presentation.

2077
01:54:21,741 --> 01:54:23,420
Less is going to be
there because you know,

2078
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:28,540
les was the celebrity that was sponsored
to our charity and then a week later

2079
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:33,920
I'm reading that this Billy challenge
his belly up and simple as that,

2080
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:37,910
but by no money, what? Like 32,000 bucks.

2081
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:42,200
I'm trying to support three lawsuits right
now. Mine, my girlfriend, I'm confused.

2082
01:54:42,201 --> 01:54:45,710
What happened? They disappeared.
They don't exist. There's a website,

2083
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:50,000
the [inaudible] dot com you hit it.
They've suspended operation.

2084
01:54:50,030 --> 01:54:53,250
We're not getting paid. Oh, so they quit.
They went under. They bailed in there.

2085
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:56,150
Something happened. Okay. We
don't know what, but I tell you,

2086
01:54:56,151 --> 01:54:59,360
that's a shitty day when you wake up. I
mean the emotion where you're like, shit,

2087
01:54:59,361 --> 01:55:00,620
we're being supported big time.

2088
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:05,090
We just went $32,000 that's going to
see me till next summer. Beautiful.

2089
01:55:05,091 --> 01:55:08,690
Because the longer I can sustain
this battle in these lawsuits,

2090
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:11,470
especially with the counter suits,
there comes a point where the,

2091
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:14,000
with the power swings,
he's trying to,

2092
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:17,600
they're trying to beat the snot out of
us in every which way they can using

2093
01:55:17,601 --> 01:55:21,260
money.
If we have that money and we last so long,

2094
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:24,650
suddenly they have to start disclosing
files in our lawsuits that they do not

2095
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:27,800
want to disclose. The objective
is bleed 'em dry, drop the suit.

2096
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,560
They've done it this historically. That's
the, that's the function of a slap suit.

2097
01:55:30,770 --> 01:55:34,990
If I got the monies and
I get so far, oh, oh,

2098
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:36,590
black fish,
the movie,

2099
01:55:37,190 --> 01:55:41,430
everything that was revealed in there
was from the Osha versus seaworld, uh,

2100
01:55:41,450 --> 01:55:43,770
trials.
All the stuff that see had to give,

2101
01:55:43,771 --> 01:55:47,610
they have to provide video of orcas
beating the snot out of trainers. Uh,

2102
01:55:47,670 --> 01:55:51,080
you know, a bunch of all these things come
out. It's the same thing with, with the,

2103
01:55:51,090 --> 01:55:51,923
with marine land,

2104
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:54,600
they're going to have to open up
files about the killer whales health.

2105
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:57,270
They're going to have to open up files
and what a lot of things exonerating us.

2106
01:55:57,570 --> 01:56:01,650
They're gonna have to show the water
log histories, the, the newspaper.

2107
01:56:01,651 --> 01:56:04,470
It has that. But nonetheless, they're
going to have to disclose these things.

2108
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:07,500
They don't want to do that.
Their objective is sue the shit out of us.

2109
01:56:07,501 --> 01:56:09,390
Make us broke. Drop the suit. Go.

2110
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:11,820
That was the way of the nineties
eighties seventies whatever.

2111
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:14,670
It's a new day and age.
Suddenly there's a Streisand effect.

2112
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:18,660
You Sue me to shut me up, blows up
the whole thing. It blows it right up.

2113
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:20,490
Everyone's listening.
People give a shit.

2114
01:56:21,210 --> 01:56:24,120
I wind up getting enough money to see
this thing through. He can't drop it.

2115
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:28,340
I got the counter suit while let's
start opening books. You want to see,

2116
01:56:28,341 --> 01:56:31,200
you want to have a look inside.
Let's start opening books, you know,

2117
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:33,670
and it doesn't. Opening financial
books, finding out how many profiting,

2118
01:56:34,140 --> 01:56:37,370
medical records, water
log history, how did,

2119
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:39,900
how much did you pay for those dolphins?
Let's find out like whatever. I mean,

2120
01:56:39,901 --> 01:56:41,340
there's a bunch of things
that apply to the losses,

2121
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,620
but moreover there's also the question of,
Hey,

2122
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:45,420
if you're a person that's
going to turn around and say,

2123
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:49,620
I don't think animal abuse is cool and
you wind up being sued, made, broke,

2124
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:53,460
wiped out, that's not a good precedence
to send for people out there.

2125
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:56,180
It's not good for the human race.
It's not good. It's precisely at,

2126
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:00,540
this is less about, I mean
it's about animals primarily.
Initially, this is social,

2127
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:01,580
social justice.

2128
01:57:01,580 --> 01:57:05,000
So what you're essentially doing is
reaching more people than the people who

2129
01:57:05,001 --> 01:57:08,150
have influenced, can reach with
their money and their influence.

2130
01:57:08,151 --> 01:57:11,090
They've collected a bunch of people
that are controlling the regulations and

2131
01:57:11,091 --> 01:57:14,450
enforcing the laws and they figured out
a way to keep these people under their

2132
01:57:14,451 --> 01:57:17,390
wing. But what you're doing
by getting on this podcast,

2133
01:57:17,391 --> 01:57:21,110
by starting your India Gogo count and
fucking being one of the Gogo girls or

2134
01:57:21,111 --> 01:57:21,860
whatever,

2135
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:26,150
what you're doing is spreading
that passed their reach of control.

2136
01:57:26,151 --> 01:57:28,280
He's got money. They only have
a little bit of money though.

2137
01:57:28,281 --> 01:57:31,100
They don't have that much money. How
much money is, yeah, he's got a billion.

2138
01:57:31,101 --> 01:57:32,120
He's got to have a lot more than me.

2139
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:34,670
This is a fucking 300 million
people in this country.

2140
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:38,360
If you get $1 million of
those people find out I sleep.

2141
01:57:38,361 --> 01:57:41,390
How much money does he have?
Really? And by the way,

2142
01:57:41,450 --> 01:57:44,420
if you start fucking organizing
a boycott of his property,

2143
01:57:44,510 --> 01:57:47,990
that money goes away ultra fast.
While the numbers are down bad,

2144
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:50,930
they fucking should be,
man. It's a prison colony

2145
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:56,590
at the monies. I sleep easy. Again.
I took this thing on. This wasn't,

2146
01:57:56,770 --> 01:57:58,540
hey,
for the next 80 hours,

2147
01:57:58,541 --> 01:58:00,940
every fucking week you're going to go
petition the shit out of trying to get

2148
01:58:00,941 --> 01:58:04,960
people's money. That sucks. Asking
for people for money really sucks.

2149
01:58:05,050 --> 01:58:06,790
What the hell else am I supposed to do?
I've been pinned.

2150
01:58:06,791 --> 01:58:09,700
I've been backed into a corner. I'm coming
out swinging. I got to do what I can.

2151
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:11,200
It seems to be working.

2152
01:58:11,230 --> 01:58:15,340
We're getting somewhere that anti slap
legislation that was announced in Ontario

2153
01:58:15,490 --> 01:58:18,580
that's coming. If that aunt anti
slap comes sooner than later,

2154
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:20,920
we're in a race right now like anti slap,

2155
01:58:20,921 --> 01:58:23,650
meaning that it stops these kinds
of legal lawsuits that's happening.

2156
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:26,590
I think it's in it's second reading
and Ontario legislation like,

2157
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:30,190
and this is all because of the lawsuits
that were, that were launched against us.

2158
01:58:30,310 --> 01:58:32,830
There's, there's a lot of attention,
so suddenly they're getting nervous,

2159
01:58:32,831 --> 01:58:34,670
so they're really pushing this agenda.
They're trying to,

2160
01:58:35,350 --> 01:58:38,650
they're trying to get me to pony up for
this motion to strike out everything.

2161
01:58:38,651 --> 01:58:42,880
In our defense. Everything
in our counterclaim lawyers
are us. 15,000 bucks a pop.

2162
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:46,180
I got three lawyers. I'm trying
to support mine, my case,

2163
01:58:46,270 --> 01:58:51,040
my girlfriends and this nice man who
worked for 12 years who spoke about the

2164
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:55,500
time the owner shot two pets,
golden retrievers on his,

2165
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:58,300
on his, uh, on his property
and marina property.

2166
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,430
They went and sued him for telling
them, wait a minute, wait a minute.

2167
01:59:00,431 --> 01:59:04,930
What did he do? It's deep. He
allegedly, I was there that day.

2168
01:59:04,931 --> 01:59:07,630
I can attest that a lot
of things that happened,

2169
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:12,190
these dogs come running in these two
pets. Golden retrievers, golden labs,

2170
01:59:12,191 --> 01:59:14,750
golden retrievers.
Well he doesn't want them there to more.

2171
01:59:14,751 --> 01:59:16,600
They're running up and down the
fence there bothering the deer.

2172
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:22,100
He shot the day here. Two
shots. I come in to work.

2173
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:26,780
Someone's out there doing his thing.
Phone rings. What's this guys name?

2174
01:59:27,170 --> 01:59:30,920
John Holder. He's the one who shot
these two golden retrievers allegedly.

2175
01:59:33,420 --> 01:59:34,110
Whoa.

2176
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:38,430
So the guy who was very brave to say that
and have other stories where he had to

2177
01:59:38,431 --> 01:59:43,200
do some really had them do some really
tough things is being sued as well.

2178
01:59:43,230 --> 01:59:47,490
Whose dogs with these? The neighbors. One
of the low, one of like two houses down,

2179
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:50,200
so the dog's just got out of the yard
or something like that out of the yard.

2180
01:59:50,230 --> 01:59:52,950
Barking started into the parking lot
because the right across the street is the

2181
01:59:52,951 --> 01:59:56,790
deer park. Gates Open. Dogs
start in Shit. My dogs are gone.

2182
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,770
Boom, boom. There's witnesses. Whoa.

2183
02:00:01,130 --> 02:00:04,440
Well had these dogs at tag the deer where
they just, oh well. I mean, I don't know.

2184
02:00:04,441 --> 02:00:07,710
I wasn't there for that, but
nonetheless, I mean, fuck you,

2185
02:00:07,711 --> 02:00:11,490
don't you don't you just call the Osp,
say come get these fucking dogs. The labs.

2186
02:00:11,491 --> 02:00:15,180
You come grab me, go, come here buddy.
They're the sweetest dogs on earth.

2187
02:00:15,181 --> 02:00:18,000
Told you off the hop. Don't try to
rationalize his thinking. Everything.

2188
02:00:18,001 --> 02:00:21,960
It's a good idea is a bad dude. Golden
labs are just the sweetest dogs ever.

2189
02:00:21,961 --> 02:00:25,020
I've never met a single mean one
in my life. That stories out there.

2190
02:00:25,021 --> 02:00:26,670
The videos are a shitty poodles.

2191
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:29,760
Every golden lab I met wants to give
you a kiss when you get close to it.

2192
02:00:29,761 --> 02:00:33,660
Those things are gems there. They're
beautiful dogs. That star investigation,

2193
02:00:33,661 --> 02:00:36,210
if you go to this, the Toronto Star
website and just look up Marineland,

2194
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:39,330
there's probably three dozen stories
and that's in there. Yeah, boom.

2195
02:00:39,390 --> 02:00:41,640
He's how never get that web.
Well,

2196
02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:46,710
that's harsh shot neighbor's
dogs. Yeah. Wow. Oh my God.

2197
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:48,480
I heard these stories.
There's,

2198
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:51,810
there's a shit ton and it wasn't just
the three of us that are being sued.

2199
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:55,590
It's a bunch of people. He's suing
an activist for one point $5 million.

2200
02:00:55,770 --> 02:00:59,760
This guy come out of nowhere. There's
the dog. So that was the dogs. Oh my God.

2201
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,580
There's actually video of the dog.
Very playful, beautiful freaking dogs.

2202
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:07,230
Their fucking pants. Well
now they're dirt. Oh God.

2203
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:11,290
What an asshole. So what happened
out of this? But he got sued. Yeah,

2204
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:13,680
but he's getting sued.
Who's getting sued?

2205
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:18,180
So the night I was out of pocket $5,000
someone's going to retain a lawyer for

2206
02:01:18,181 --> 02:01:20,760
this man. Who's going to do it. I'm
looking around and shit. I buddy,

2207
02:01:20,761 --> 02:01:23,070
you're talking not talking about it on
whole or you're talking about your friend

2208
02:01:23,071 --> 02:01:25,490
who got in trouble for this?
Talking about the guy who right,

2209
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:29,220
who came out about this and then
started to sleep easy at night.

2210
02:01:29,221 --> 02:01:30,310
Decided to say look,
cause he,

2211
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:33,510
he quit about six months
before I did amidst really,

2212
02:01:33,511 --> 02:01:35,220
I mean if you think the
marine mammals got it tough,

2213
02:01:35,221 --> 02:01:37,620
you should see the land animals
at this place. It's real tough.

2214
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:39,320
Some really shitty things going on.

2215
02:01:39,470 --> 02:01:44,030
What do you mean land animals? Marine land
has landed on his own. It's own entity,

2216
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:47,150
man. They have bears. What? Oh yeah,

2217
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:50,300
they have bears should read about
the bears. That's a shitty story.

2218
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:54,080
I fucking hate bear captivity
man. There's a video, Brian,

2219
02:01:54,081 --> 02:01:58,100
I want you to pull this up. Bear
kills man. And like eight seconds.

2220
02:01:58,550 --> 02:01:59,780
There's a video that I,

2221
02:02:00,230 --> 02:02:05,230
I refer to whenever anybody talks to
me about bears being trained and people

2222
02:02:05,541 --> 02:02:10,190
training bears and pull up the video.
Brian have a bear,

2223
02:02:10,191 --> 02:02:13,970
a kills man and fucking seven
seconds or whatever it was.

2224
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:17,690
It was the bear from a movie. I forgot
the move. I want to say the longest shot,

2225
02:02:17,691 --> 02:02:18,890
but it wasn't the longest yard.

2226
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:22,160
It was like first and Tan or some fucking
football movie or something like that.

2227
02:02:22,161 --> 02:02:23,120
There was a bear in that movie.

2228
02:02:23,121 --> 02:02:27,950
A trained bear is Baird worked in
Hollywood and films and TV shows,

2229
02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:31,280
his cousin or brother or something.

2230
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:33,500
He's having the guy stand
there while he's trained.

2231
02:02:33,501 --> 02:02:37,640
The bear cause happens for real and the
bear just attacks the guy out of nowhere

2232
02:02:37,641 --> 02:02:41,510
for no reason. He's a barrier.
Just exactly launches. It's out.

2233
02:02:41,511 --> 02:02:44,120
This is it right here. This is
terrible. I can tell you right now,

2234
02:02:44,121 --> 02:02:46,130
looking at that bear, I can
tell you this. Trouble brewing.

2235
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:50,660
The guy's standing there and he's just
doing nothing and the bear just decides

2236
02:02:50,661 --> 02:02:53,900
to fuck him up and that's it. It
should turn away. Turn away, Brian.

2237
02:02:53,901 --> 02:02:57,110
I want to see him. Shit. That's the
end. He ripped the guys, throw it out.

2238
02:02:57,140 --> 02:03:00,830
The guy was dead in seconds. You can't
fuck with bears, man. They do what?

2239
02:03:00,831 --> 02:03:04,760
They want. Their bears. Same as killer
whales, man. Same as any animal there.

2240
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:06,800
They're wild.
It's not a golden lab.

2241
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:10,810
A golden lab is not a wild animal
by any stretch of the imagination.

2242
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:15,860
Two shotgun shots all took man. That
the details in those stories. Uh,

2243
02:03:16,210 --> 02:03:20,260
you know, when Jim quit, I was
the day that those, uh, those,

2244
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:21,580
those dogs got shot.

2245
02:03:21,581 --> 02:03:24,040
I actually got pissed at Jim because
I was in the office with the vet.

2246
02:03:24,041 --> 02:03:27,280
The vet gets a call. She's like, what?
Oh my God. Puts the phone down. She like,

2247
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:32,080
fuck the owner of just shot two
retrievers are golden last. I'm like,

2248
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:36,430
fuck. They're like, well, you
know, Jim wanted to do this,
but he didn't. I was like,

2249
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:40,240
fuck man. I was pissed at gym.
In my mind, I'm like, Jim, quit.

2250
02:03:40,241 --> 02:03:44,410
Surely after Jim was in a real tough
spot. Jim Speaks brave as hell. Man,

2251
02:03:44,411 --> 02:03:48,650
I'm so proud of this man. He's the
nicest, gentle man you've ever met. Boom.

2252
02:03:48,651 --> 02:03:51,670
He slapped to the fucking lawsuit.
So while, who's going to pony up?

2253
02:03:52,120 --> 02:03:55,360
I was out of pocket. I start fundraising
out of pockets are fundraising,

2254
02:03:55,361 --> 02:03:58,150
but that's the idea. They keep
launching suits. We can't keep up,

2255
02:03:58,151 --> 02:04:01,840
but at some point, man can't
keep launching them. Ontario
govern paid attention.

2256
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:05,110
Can't do it. No more anti
slap legislation. It's
coming. But we're in a race.

2257
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:07,240
We're in a race because they're
pushing these different things.

2258
02:04:07,510 --> 02:04:10,300
There's an activist, as I was saying,
and his name's Mike Garrett. He was,

2259
02:04:10,330 --> 02:04:13,660
he read the star articles in the newspaper
about everything that's going on.

2260
02:04:13,661 --> 02:04:15,910
He's like, what the fuck starts
holding the sign up there.

2261
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:19,020
Danny brings out a bull horn. Then he
starts interacting with the owners.

2262
02:04:19,021 --> 02:04:21,520
It's a video there. That's amazing. You
want to see the owner of marine land?

2263
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:25,630
He uh, he starts like, he's actually
threatened to stab the guy on video,

2264
02:04:25,631 --> 02:04:29,380
which is crazy.
And the fucking Susan,

2265
02:04:29,770 --> 02:04:32,800
he sues him for a bunch of Shit. That
never happened. It's all bullshit.

2266
02:04:32,830 --> 02:04:34,840
It's a slap suit. It's just, hey,

2267
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:36,790
if you keep talking and
telling the truth about us,

2268
02:04:36,930 --> 02:04:39,900
we're going to sue you to
shut you up. Well, that's,

2269
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:44,250
now that's more so what I'm advocating
for, this is a social justice issue. Now,

2270
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:47,160
you know, so I keep making a
stink, but at the end of the line,

2271
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:49,320
there's always smooshy.
I still have dreams, man.

2272
02:04:49,470 --> 02:04:52,080
I still want to see what that animal,
I know what she's going through.

2273
02:04:52,081 --> 02:04:56,880
Of course I need to see her. So is this
what's turning you into a vegetarian? No,

2274
02:04:56,881 --> 02:04:59,100
it's, you know what it is? It's
so on Twitter. On Facebook.

2275
02:04:59,101 --> 02:05:01,410
Like people are following me.
Right. And they're always, you know,

2276
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:04,290
I follow people or I got shit on Facebook
and there's always these fricking

2277
02:05:04,291 --> 02:05:07,320
images and I'm like, ah. Right. It keeps
seeing him keep seeing him. He can't,

2278
02:05:07,321 --> 02:05:09,810
like I said, you can't unsee.
You don't, it doesn't take long.

2279
02:05:09,811 --> 02:05:12,360
You only got to watch 30 seconds of
one video would be like off, off.

2280
02:05:12,870 --> 02:05:16,440
I don't need that no more.
That's, that's out. I like cheese.

2281
02:05:16,470 --> 02:05:18,270
I have a real tough time
getting away from cheese,

2282
02:05:18,690 --> 02:05:21,570
like really old thin
slice chai for cheese.

2283
02:05:21,870 --> 02:05:25,260
They suffer like you would not imagine
at the end. They do in the worst ways.

2284
02:05:25,261 --> 02:05:27,720
Milk, milk. I'm off milk. Wait a minute.

2285
02:05:27,930 --> 02:05:31,020
But what about natural organic milk
where they just go in and milked the cow?

2286
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,780
I'd have to see it.
I'd have to see it to know,

2287
02:05:33,781 --> 02:05:38,250
but I know the milk that I was drinking
and the gallons is done. I'm out.

2288
02:05:38,370 --> 02:05:40,830
I see what you're saying.
So the factory farmed milk,

2289
02:05:40,831 --> 02:05:42,540
the way they get it on the standard,

2290
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:44,670
I don't know what percentage
of what you buy at the store,

2291
02:05:44,671 --> 02:05:49,560
but a great deal of it is cruel at
you that you cannot imagine. Ah, dude,

2292
02:05:49,561 --> 02:05:53,220
why you bumming me out now? Welcome to
my world. Every time I log into Facebook,

2293
02:05:53,221 --> 02:05:57,310
boom, milk cows shitty. Especially now
that you're connected to that. Well,

2294
02:05:57,311 --> 02:05:58,490
all these people have befriended,

2295
02:05:58,530 --> 02:06:00,900
they're all supporting and they're all
doing their costs. You know, I wanna,

2296
02:06:01,050 --> 02:06:01,531
I wanna help.

2297
02:06:01,531 --> 02:06:06,360
I wanna see what we were talking about
earlier about the broad spectrum of human

2298
02:06:06,361 --> 02:06:10,320
behavior that people can be kind and
sweet and people can be fucking murderous.

2299
02:06:10,321 --> 02:06:11,370
Cons.
There's,

2300
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:15,870
there's this spectrum and unfortunately
that manifests itself in business as

2301
02:06:15,871 --> 02:06:16,171
well.

2302
02:06:16,171 --> 02:06:19,620
And the way we treat animals as far as
factory farming and as far as running

2303
02:06:19,621 --> 02:06:22,860
these marine animal facilities
or zoo. Moreover, the,

2304
02:06:22,870 --> 02:06:24,590
the people that are working
at these places, yeah.

2305
02:06:24,650 --> 02:06:26,790
They got to earn that of course.
And not only that,

2306
02:06:26,970 --> 02:06:30,630
they probably like you went into it
with good intentions and along the way

2307
02:06:30,810 --> 02:06:34,020
realize what it actually was. You
start when you, I mean, you got to,

2308
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:35,400
you got to pry open that third eye.

2309
02:06:35,401 --> 02:06:36,840
You've got to sort of
get yourself out of the,

2310
02:06:36,930 --> 02:06:39,770
out of the element itself and look
from a different perspective altogether

2311
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:44,100
cookie and go to the zoo. Uh, I
would definitely advocate for that.

2312
02:06:44,130 --> 02:06:47,940
Let's play that video and uh,
I gotta take a leak.

2313
02:06:48,270 --> 02:06:50,600
So let's play that video
and I'll come back while, so

2314
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:56,760
you still have it? No. Why would you?
You're going to see the dog video,

2315
02:06:57,510 --> 02:06:59,420
the video that he was going
to play earlier. Oh, this one.

2316
02:07:02,370 --> 02:07:06,970
The only way really to do Marineland or
to do a story like Marine Le Pen is to

2317
02:07:06,971 --> 02:07:11,971
have an insider or somebody who's just
left and worked inside a long time.

2318
02:07:12,730 --> 02:07:16,090
And I never thought that I
would be able to get somebody.

2319
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:20,080
And then when I did,
I thought that the story would probably,

2320
02:07:20,110 --> 02:07:23,920
I would be on it a couple of weeks,
maybe a month, it would be some digging.

2321
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,590
And we're almost a year later.

2322
02:07:26,650 --> 02:07:31,360
It just kept growing into different
stories and his different government

2323
02:07:31,361 --> 02:07:34,630
departments got involved.
It just went on and on.

2324
02:07:34,631 --> 02:07:37,640
I mean there a period
where either myself or,

2325
02:07:37,641 --> 02:07:40,300
or with another photographer
or with Liam Casey,

2326
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:45,330
we lived on the road between here and
Niagara Falls in May of 2012 I got a phone

2327
02:07:46,841 --> 02:07:50,620
call from someone who said that there
was a lawyer who was talking to somebody

2328
02:07:50,621 --> 02:07:52,420
who had worked at marine land and talk.

2329
02:07:52,421 --> 02:07:56,710
This person had some issues with marine
land and wondered if I wanted to talk to

2330
02:07:56,711 --> 02:07:58,780
them.
It was really difficult.

2331
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:02,290
And finally in the end he
decided he would talk to us.

2332
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:05,230
And that was filled in Maris,
the first whistle blower.

2333
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:09,660
Over the course of my tenure at marine
land, I was witness to things that

2334
02:08:11,190 --> 02:08:16,190
people would never imagine a place
like marine pen to be capable of.

2335
02:08:16,810 --> 02:08:21,580
In the end we were working with
15 whistleblowers and it was, um,

2336
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:26,610
they're feeling that problems that had
existed with the water not being able to

2337
02:08:27,701 --> 02:08:32,200
get the low levels raid had caused
health problems in the animals.

2338
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:36,100
And also short staffing
had caused problems

2339
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:40,450
cause we didn't have the resources,
we didn't have the people to

2340
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:45,670
get the animals to do these certain tree
behaviors that we would otherwise want

2341
02:08:45,671 --> 02:08:48,640
them to do. The first line of
defense was to give him the drugs.

2342
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:51,700
I saw things that that resulted in death.

2343
02:08:52,110 --> 02:08:56,260
You're basically hitting your head against
the wall trying to make changes for

2344
02:08:56,261 --> 02:09:01,010
the better for the animals. And one
day I walked in and walked out, uh,

2345
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:02,080
just said,
that's enough.

2346
02:09:02,910 --> 02:09:06,750
Oh there was a huge reaction from the
public. I mean, a massive reaction.

2347
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:09,690
My email was jammed.

2348
02:09:09,691 --> 02:09:14,691
I think we got something like 270,000
views on the video and the first day the

2349
02:09:14,971 --> 02:09:19,971
OSP CIA issued orders against marine
land on a number of Caribou mainland.

2350
02:09:20,830 --> 02:09:22,830
Completed all orders from the,

2351
02:09:23,940 --> 02:09:27,180
but what was also interesting
is that the government reacted,

2352
02:09:27,210 --> 02:09:31,170
the Minister Medlin mayor is
bringing in a program one,

2353
02:09:31,171 --> 02:09:36,171
it's her hope to license
zoos and aquariums in Ontario
because they're not at

2354
02:09:36,301 --> 02:09:36,931
this time.

2355
02:09:36,931 --> 02:09:41,250
The second thing will be special standards
of care for marine mammals because

2356
02:09:41,251 --> 02:09:44,520
there's nothing and the
third will be greater powers,

2357
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:50,240
more money and greater responsibility and
also hopefully Trent more transparency

2358
02:09:50,851 --> 02:09:51,621
for the OSP.

2359
02:09:51,621 --> 02:09:56,621
Ca Three of the trainers who
spoke to me and have been sued,

2360
02:09:57,180 --> 02:10:01,800
these are generally slap suits which
are basically to to shut them down,

2361
02:10:01,801 --> 02:10:05,550
but still this hootsuite for
I think a million, 1,000,001.

2362
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:09,630
They haven't gone to discovery or
anything yet and I know they have a lot of

2363
02:10:09,631 --> 02:10:14,370
supporters. When I did these stories
and Liam and I worked together,

2364
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:18,630
we were writing about the animals.
We had no desire and have no desire,

2365
02:10:18,631 --> 02:10:20,910
just shut marine land down or anything.

2366
02:10:20,940 --> 02:10:23,700
There's that Mr. Holder
has been saying it butters.

2367
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,870
All we wanted to do is tell people,
we went to marine land,

2368
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:30,930
we talked to people,
we interviewed people who've worked there.

2369
02:10:30,931 --> 02:10:34,520
We've looked at records, we've looked
at video, and here's what's happening.

2370
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:38,240
That's all. And I hope that they're able
to make them much better. Marineland

2371
02:10:39,980 --> 02:10:44,360
yeah, he sued, he sued the trial
starts to really chat. Amazing.

2372
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:46,880
What'd he sued them for?
Um,

2373
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:49,640
I don't know exactly their sort of tight
lipped at that end. They don't, you know,

2374
02:10:49,870 --> 02:10:53,260
that they're not going to reveal too
much, but the matter of fact is, uh,

2375
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:57,240
the Toronto Star or any media, you
know, they get a suit. Did you know,

2376
02:10:57,241 --> 02:10:59,810
in the room of these places, demand
an apology if there's been a mistake.

2377
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:02,390
Sometimes they just, you know, there's
a little little money paid out.

2378
02:11:02,391 --> 02:11:06,140
Something else starts fighting this
completely. They're like, yeah, let's go.

2379
02:11:06,230 --> 02:11:11,180
Let's do this. Well, we tweeted it. Uh, I
just tweeted it about 10 minutes ago. Um,

2380
02:11:11,540 --> 02:11:15,760
and uh, I'll tweet it again and
we'll promote it on this podcast and,

2381
02:11:16,130 --> 02:11:19,250
and try to get some people to
contribute some money to help out your,

2382
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:21,830
your legal defense.
And my thing is I don't need,

2383
02:11:21,980 --> 02:11:24,230
I don't need a lot from you and he,
a lot of you,

2384
02:11:24,410 --> 02:11:27,680
she knew a lot of people don't we five
bones, man, we can get through this thing.

2385
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:28,513
And the other thing is,
you know,

2386
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:30,880
there's reality TV out there
and people obsess over it.

2387
02:11:30,890 --> 02:11:33,470
They can't believe that this scripted
bullshit. I mean, you know about it.

2388
02:11:33,471 --> 02:11:35,450
I know about it.
I was on the TV show white bone.

2389
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:38,090
I know about sort of the scripting
and things you were on wipe out.

2390
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:40,880
I was on white folks. My friends
show Mac units. I was going to say,

2391
02:11:40,881 --> 02:11:45,881
because I think it was shortly after a
fear factor that they went with the wipe

2392
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:49,250
out. Yeah. It's end them
all. Yeah. He created it.

2393
02:11:49,251 --> 02:11:53,290
Wild wild fear factor was going
on, right? Yeah. Yeah. We've,

2394
02:11:53,291 --> 02:11:55,000
we've been over there
many times like that,

2395
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:58,870
that place where they filmed it in
Argentina or an la? No, they only one.

2396
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:02,210
The one I see me when I did the Canadian
version that they basically sent this

2397
02:12:02,211 --> 02:12:05,870
to Argentina. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. They
do like they do it all over the world now.

2398
02:12:05,871 --> 02:12:08,330
Right. And bunch of different
countries and they all go to Argentina.

2399
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:11,510
I think the states is the only one
that has like a really amazing course.

2400
02:12:11,511 --> 02:12:14,750
That course is awesome. It's evolved quite
a bit. The one that Argentina is like,

2401
02:12:15,220 --> 02:12:18,530
it's pretty bad ass like
donkey Kong and shit.

2402
02:12:18,531 --> 02:12:21,920
Just like metal rods everywhere like
that. She's real. Yeah. It's nasty.

2403
02:12:21,921 --> 02:12:25,360
It's a fallacy. It's a fall
course. So you got mistreated.

2404
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:28,160
Much like the animals get mistreated.
His fucking,

2405
02:12:28,161 --> 02:12:32,240
that's the theme here on the show. Yeah.
I won though. Oh, congratulations. Thanks.

2406
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:34,790
That's awesome. That's bad ass.
I owe it all to smoosh. Yes.

2407
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:36,260
The only reason I was ever on the video,
right.

2408
02:12:36,330 --> 02:12:40,760
You were doing it to try to earn some
money? No, just the, uh, back in 2008,

2409
02:12:40,761 --> 02:12:42,830
that was like the meat immediate
shitstorm that took off.

2410
02:12:42,830 --> 02:12:46,010
Like Jimmy Kimmel did a piece,
like inside edition did a piece of,

2411
02:12:46,011 --> 02:12:48,770
it was like a fluff piece of smoosh
and i's relationship, but it took off.

2412
02:12:48,771 --> 02:12:50,090
It was on the cover of CNN for awhile.

2413
02:12:50,270 --> 02:12:54,260
And so I just sort of pieced all that
together and applied to wipe out and was

2414
02:12:54,261 --> 02:12:57,680
like, Hey, I'm this guy. And they
were like, hey, you're on. It's okay.

2415
02:12:57,710 --> 02:13:01,640
So I'll go do that and try to
win money. Wow. Well listen man,

2416
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:05,540
I hope we help. I hope we helped
raise awareness. I thank you.

2417
02:13:05,541 --> 02:13:09,670
You did a great job of representing
your position and representing the,

2418
02:13:09,671 --> 02:13:13,280
the idea behind what you're trying
to do and the situation that you find

2419
02:13:13,281 --> 02:13:17,870
yourself in. And I think it's very
admirable and I think, um, that, uh,

2420
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:20,120
I think you're going to get a
lot of sport. I hope so, man.

2421
02:13:20,121 --> 02:13:23,000
I really appreciate your letting me come
out here and it was fascinating, man.

2422
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,580
It was really interesting. I really
appreciate you having the balls to do it.

2423
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:30,350
Well, balls, idiots. See Christmas,
call it part of being a person, Ben.

2424
02:13:30,870 --> 02:13:34,650
Then the future, they'll look back on
it and say it's balls, but right now,

2425
02:13:34,860 --> 02:13:39,080
whatever you just doing your thing, man.
Tweet that shit man. I tweeted it already.

2426
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:43,400
Thanks man. And uh, we'll uh, we'll tweet
it more in the upcoming weeks and uh,

2427
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:46,800
just get in contact with me and if you
have more things you need to promote,

2428
02:13:46,801 --> 02:13:49,890
we'll be happy and really happy to have
you come on again and give us an update

2429
02:13:49,891 --> 02:13:51,540
in a few months and tell
us where things are at.

2430
02:13:51,541 --> 02:13:54,780
Like I was saying reality TV or pay
for this, I mean this, it's developing,

2431
02:13:54,781 --> 02:13:56,490
it's staying on the front pages. So, well,

2432
02:13:56,491 --> 02:13:59,250
you could get a reality TV show just
because of this interview that's in the

2433
02:13:59,251 --> 02:14:03,870
lawsuit. I can't, you can't. Well, in the
lawsuit and the lawsuit they're alleging,

2434
02:14:03,871 --> 02:14:07,360
I'm really pissed off because why
couldn't you get a reality show up?

2435
02:14:07,390 --> 02:14:10,800
A couple of reality shows were
proposed to me after wipe out, right?

2436
02:14:10,830 --> 02:14:13,620
And in the lawsuit they're
saying, oh, these reality shows,

2437
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:15,630
that's why he's really mad
and making up these lies.

2438
02:14:15,780 --> 02:14:17,010
And they went through all this shit up.

2439
02:14:17,011 --> 02:14:19,710
That's how I became the Kanye west
of animal training. They say that,

2440
02:14:19,711 --> 02:14:24,330
but don't say that. Stop you just filled
dimmers. Stop this Kanye West. Bullshit.

2441
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:28,220
That's gotta stop. It's gotta stop.
It's stupid. Uh, but the, the,

2442
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:31,560
what I'm wondering when she was about
is how could they stop you from doing a

2443
02:14:31,561 --> 02:14:34,320
reality show? How can they
prevent you from earning a living?

2444
02:14:34,470 --> 02:14:37,760
How can they stop you from expressing
yourself in any way that you choose to see

2445
02:14:38,070 --> 02:14:38,311
more?

2446
02:14:38,311 --> 02:14:40,680
So it's the sense that with all these
lawsuits and no one wants to touch it,

2447
02:14:40,710 --> 02:14:43,530
no one wants to touch anything. Right? I
think that's nonsense. People in America,

2448
02:14:43,531 --> 02:14:46,110
I guarantee you will touch it. Hey,
we had an article that was going on,

2449
02:14:46,111 --> 02:14:49,420
a very big magazine,
a very big man cause he was coming up,

2450
02:14:49,421 --> 02:14:51,870
was going to tell the Fillon and smooshy
story. This thing was going to be,

2451
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:55,200
I mean this was godsend.
They manage to quash that it's gone.

2452
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:56,670
They won't do it because the lawsuits,

2453
02:14:56,700 --> 02:15:01,050
there's dudes scrambling right now writing
your name down. Trust me. This is a,

2454
02:15:01,051 --> 02:15:05,400
this is with a in America, here's what
matters on reality shows, ratings,

2455
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:09,270
how many people are watching. If a lot
of people were watching it gets on TV.

2456
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:12,200
It's that simple, but it's the money
generated doesn't support a lawsuit.

2457
02:15:12,210 --> 02:15:14,340
Then what?
I suppose Canada is a different story.

2458
02:15:14,341 --> 02:15:16,910
I mean we're not talking about if the
money generated from what? From a,

2459
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:20,040
from a reality show show, which you
can start balancing port a lawsuit.

2460
02:15:20,040 --> 02:15:20,791
In what way?
Well,

2461
02:15:20,791 --> 02:15:23,640
I don't know if someone launched a TV
company turns around and talks to me, hey,

2462
02:15:23,641 --> 02:15:24,360
we want to talk about,

2463
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:27,460
we want to do a suit or a show
about you fighting a marina marina.

2464
02:15:27,461 --> 02:15:29,040
She gets immediately sue them,

2465
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:31,530
immediately sued them so that
TVs coming like thing like that,

2466
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:34,180
like universal pictures or something
like that is afraid of morale.

2467
02:15:34,220 --> 02:15:36,840
I haven't got the call from them, but if
they call, I suppose maybe they won't.

2468
02:15:36,841 --> 02:15:39,300
But a lot of people have been scared.
A lot of people have been scared.

2469
02:15:39,330 --> 02:15:43,830
So you alleged that they've been scared
off of doing other reality shows?

2470
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:46,140
There were, she were to say
that there were two. Listen,

2471
02:15:46,141 --> 02:15:48,390
not that maybe it's probably
not a good thing. Well,

2472
02:15:48,391 --> 02:15:51,330
we know that it's slapped litigation,
so it's all bullshit anyways.

2473
02:15:51,790 --> 02:15:54,300
I'm pretty sure they're done.
Let's not bullshit is the cause.

2474
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:56,640
It's a great cause and I think,
uh,

2475
02:15:56,730 --> 02:16:01,290
I think this and the movie blackfish has
highlighted a real problem that we have

2476
02:16:01,291 --> 02:16:05,490
is there's a real disconnect with the way
we view these animal parks and I think

2477
02:16:05,491 --> 02:16:07,290
they're fucked up. And
I turned this man. Yeah,

2478
02:16:07,291 --> 02:16:11,340
awareness is important and
the conversation is important
and I'm glad you got it

2479
02:16:11,341 --> 02:16:14,640
out there. We lost that 32,000
bucks, but on the flip side, boom,

2480
02:16:14,641 --> 02:16:17,790
I'm on the Joe Rogan show and blackfish
come out. I'll trade that all day.

be at Thunderpussy at the ice house,

2501
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:33,640
which is a show where I guess how's
it go again? Uh, you can get on stage.

2502
02:17:33,641 --> 02:17:36,940
People from the audience get yelled at
a topic and you just try to do stand up

2503
02:17:36,941 --> 02:17:39,670
about that topic on the spot.
Sine I've been doing that since the eight.

2504
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:43,780
I know you're going to be a professional
that's called being stoned on stage.

2505
02:17:43,781 --> 02:17:46,970
That's fucking par for the course. All
right. Uh, thank you Phil and Phil.
