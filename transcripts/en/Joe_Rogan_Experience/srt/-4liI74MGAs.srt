3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:02,821

4
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:05,520

5
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,570

00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:09,570
Buckle up bitches or anythings like that.

8
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,320

You get 15% off the number ones.

15
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,950

17
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:26,064
bitches.

18
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,460
Some music

19
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,720
cause it wouldn't be a podcast.

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,060
See

21
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,690

22
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,523
boom,

23
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,430
we're in action.

24
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,080
See that Mazda Vania it feels,

25
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:45,030
it feels a lot more legit right now.

26
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,511
It does.

27
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:49,260
My good pal Mazda Bronys with us and we
have to talk shit before we get started

28
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:52,740
about the fucking Tascam Dr 100.

29
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,030
This is our third one.

30
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:55,020
You dirty bitches.

31
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,561
How about k?

32
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,520
Tascam MP,

33
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:59,730
three recorder people get
your fucking shit together.

34
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,050
But ass cam,

35
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,310
that's how bad they are.

36
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:02,821
Yes,

37
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:03,121
look,

38
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:03,800
there you go.

39
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,620
There you go.

40
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,510
Not tascam ask him.

41
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,920
Says Mazda Brian.

42
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:10,740
It gets all these great reviews and
honestly it makes some great sound.

43
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:11,551
It sounds awesome.

44
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:12,030
It's a,

45
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,730
it's an excellent piece of kit as it were.

46
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,100
But unfortunately it
fucking breaks all the time.

47
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:20,940
This is our third one and no I don't
send it in for warranty cause I ain't got

48
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:23,790
that kind of time and I'm
a fancy man Mazda binding.

49
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,740
So just order another one with that one.

50
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:28,680
Click Shit on amazon.com
this is the third one.

51
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,500
You're like Lex Luther and superman and
never wear the same pair of socks two

52
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:32,070
days in a row.

53
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm like a black rapper throws
away his white sneakers.

54
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,041
Yeah man.

55
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:35,641
What the fuck?

56
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:37,890
We used to go on the road with Charlie
Murphy and Charlie Murphy used the

57
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:40,340
throwing new sneakers and
we'd get like a little scuff,

58
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:40,920
like that's it.

59
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,730
Silver,

60
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,300
silver.

61
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,691
It's over.

62
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:43,800
It's over for those sneakers.

63
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,760
You're a comedian,

64
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,860
you're not playing basketball.

65
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,723
Charlie Murphy,

66
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,370
he wears like those
ridiculous rapper chains.

67
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,030
You know they're covered in diamonds
and bling bling and he doesn't wear them

68
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:54,301
all.

69
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:55,111
When he goes on stage,

70
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,880
he takes them off and he
puts him on his cousin.

71
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:57,690
Richard said,

72
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,540
Richard is like his tour manager
and he'll ritual hold on the chains.

73
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,880
Is that in case he gets shot or something,

74
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,560
he just doesn't want to
blink too hard was on stage.

75
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,370
It doesn't want to
distract from the message.

76
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:08,850
It's really hard for a
comedian have to be to blinky.

77
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,620
Like only black comedians can be blinking.

78
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:11,210
There's no like,

79
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,550
yeah.

80
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,121
You know what I'm saying?

81
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:13,590
You can't Williams can pull it off.

82
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,960
It's got that whole pip
persona thing going on.

83
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:16,891
But yeah,

84
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:19,910
white guy with a lot of diamonds
like went to fucking saw.

85
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,080
I saw prince in concert recently.

86
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,310
I saw Princeton concert.

87
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:23,851
It was amazing.

88
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,684
The guy's amazing.

89
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,120
He's amazing.

90
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,870
I was like a comedian could
never dress like prince.

91
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:32,871
And do you get a certain league at a
certain license to be weird with music?

92
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,421
Yeah,

93
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:33,871
exactly.

94
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:38,850
Like he came out at at one point with
like a like for like for leg warmer thing.

95
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,900
Can you imagine as a comedian come in
next to the stage Joe Rogan's show up in

96
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,060
her leg.

97
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,020
Warmers are great.

98
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,590
He just pushes it man and
chicks fucking love him.

99
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,433
Oh my God.

100
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,050
There's,

101
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,590
there's something about
him that to them is very,

102
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:55,801
it's,

103
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:56,220
it's,

104
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,491
it's,

105
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:57,121
it's weird.

106
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:58,260
He's like five foot three,

107
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,910
he's 18 and he just was women's clothes.

108
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,990
But he's sexy though.

109
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,040
They want to fuck him.

110
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,300
He owns it.

111
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:04,901
That's what it is.

112
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,070
I was telling I was there with my wife.

113
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:06,341
I was like,

114
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:07,990
there's nothing else this guy could do.

115
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:09,580
Like he's made to do this.

116
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:10,241
Like he could never be that.

117
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:10,860
He wouldn't like it.

118
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,040
Mostly with like a ups guy.

119
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,491
You know what I'm saying?

120
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,324
Like if he shows up,

121
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,310
he says you can't.

122
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,390
And he owns it.

123
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,224
That's what it is.

124
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,080
Yeah.

125
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,320
He's a brilliant artist and he,

126
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:19,881
he's amazing.

127
00:03:19,881 --> 00:03:21,590
He's just a weird guy and I think,

128
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:21,801
you know,

129
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,460
all brilliant.

130
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,360
They're really brilliant.

131
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:27,230
Artists are off I'm finding are
almost completely fucking crazy.

132
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:27,920
Oh absolutely.

133
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,430
Yeah.

134
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,020
All the good ones from back.

135
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:31,760
I mean even like all the composers,

136
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:32,271
Beethoven,

137
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:33,320
all those guys were all nuts.

138
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,190
Their fucking minds.

139
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,511
Yeah.

140
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,330
I have to beat him.

141
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,720
Think about there was fucking nothing
but acts is hitting trees back then.

142
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:39,321
That was the sound.

143
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:42,440
They heard one lump and one
guy figures out and you know,

144
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:42,921
not really,

145
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:43,670
but you know,

146
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,570
people back then,

147
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:44,800
you know,

148
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,350
that did figure out how to orchestrate
music and how to create music and compose

149
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:52,760
incredible works of music that are still
listened to hundreds of years later.

150
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,250
Oh yeah.

151
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,660
You know,

152
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,680
that's pretty nuts man.

153
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,440
And we don't even know what
his shit really sounded like.

154
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,513
That's the craziest,

155
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,430
but also the crate,

156
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,720
I was listening to the radio one time,

157
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:01,141
they're talking about,

158
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,450
because some of these guys
like autistic autistic people,

159
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,690
some of them were like
geniuses in one way and,

160
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:06,524
and you know,

161
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,120
autistic or they have
problems in another way.

162
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,260
This one kid,

163
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:11,094
they were saying,

164
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,640
um,

165
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,110
autistic couldn't communicate that
he's at home with his mom and dad.

166
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:16,300
They live,

167
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,120
they watch a,

168
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,640
uh,

169
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:17,871
some,

170
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:22,050
some movie that had like a Beethoven
Concerto in it to just watch it,

171
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,560
you know,

172
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,120
once the,

173
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
because like 12 years old,

174
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,190
the mother goes to sleep
middle of the night,

175
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:28,650
wakes up and thinks that
the TVs playing it again,

176
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,900
the kids at the piano playing that song
from watching it once he's just learned

177
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:34,734
the song.

178
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,350
So,

179
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,640
so these guys are geniuses in
one way and crazy in another way.

180
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,201
Yeah.

181
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:40,670
We talked about autistic,

182
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,940
autistic savant on the podcast
a bunch of times before,

183
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,350
cause there's so many really amazing
examples of that kind of power.

184
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:52,940
I bet a lot of famous musicians and
composers and geniuses in the past were

185
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:54,290
probably autistic savant.

186
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,640
I just didn't know how to diagnose it.

187
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:56,960
They just considered them geniuses.

188
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,241
Yeah.

189
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:57,931
Or maybe there's like,

190
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,681
I mean there's even certain,

191
00:04:58,681 --> 00:04:59,420
like as you were talking about,

192
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,030
you know,

193
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,331
prince,

194
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,350
like there's certain levels of it,

195
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:01,441
like,

196
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:01,621
you know,

197
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:02,290
like you got the,

198
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,280
the rock star who's brilliant and amazing,

199
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:05,581
but like,

200
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:06,361
he can't like,

201
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:06,780
you know,

202
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,800
remember his address.

203
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:08,410
You know what I'm saying?

204
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,060
It needs to someone,

205
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,811
a baby's born.

206
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:10,011
Yeah.

207
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:11,040
And he's the one to babysit them.

208
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:11,760
You know,

209
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,271
I think that's,

210
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,710
I think a lot of that stuff is that

211
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,530
sure.

212
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,320
You know?

213
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,040
Yeah.

214
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,541
You wouldn't want,

215
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,880
isn't it amazing that music for like
hundreds and hundreds of years was just

216
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:22,400
written down like you couldn't record it.

217
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,390
So like,

218
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,740
like composers,

219
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,690
like when they created a piece of work,

220
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:30,140
it's actually like writing and
that's how like this is my work,

221
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:30,910
this is what I've done.

222
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,840
I've combined all these
notes in a certain way.

223
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,880
But you didn't even get
to listen to them do it.

224
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,270
Right.

225
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,930
You know,

226
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,240
they never got a chance
to record anything.

227
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:38,601
We'll,

228
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:38,931
we'll,

229
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:43,040
we'll never hear Beethoven
actually directing any music,

230
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,641
you know,

231
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:44,870
or anytime travel.

232
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,201
Yeah.

233
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:46,034
Until the time travel.

234
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,150
But isn't that amazing now
that for hundreds of years
it was just written down,

235
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,343
you know,

236
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,730
fuck it.

237
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,100
I wonder if it would sound
any different to like,

238
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:57,020
I wa like it'd be listening.

239
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,943
The Beatles when they

240
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,420
released the Mano version,

241
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:02,030
which was supposedly to
superior version was the Mano,

242
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:02,600
uh,

243
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,470
versions of all the Beatles songs cause
they were recorded in mono and then

244
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:09,500
later they remastered them at
stereo hysteria was so popular.

245
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,760
And that's what you grew up on,

246
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:15,080
was listening to stereo music of versions
of what was not supposed to be stereo.

247
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,990
So people actually like
listening to the Mano versions.

248
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:20,420
Now I wonder how much of that
is like people just being like,

249
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:20,631
Oh,

250
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,770
you should've heard that.

251
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,040
Oh,

252
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,521
you know what I'm saying?

253
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:23,010
People do that.

254
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,110
Although you should all man,

255
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:24,901
the classic that it,

256
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:25,190
uh,

257
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,941
when in reality,

258
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:26,421
I mean it's like,

259
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:26,691
you know,

260
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:30,080
HD versus [inaudible] kind of
mixed different too though,

261
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:33,830
like things that come out in stereo that
weren't really necessarily supposed to

262
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:34,820
be out more.

263
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,121
You know,

264
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:37,790
it's so I actually have
both versions and uh,

265
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,541
it definitely,

266
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,860
I could see what people are saying.

267
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:44,330
It's more hardcore hitting and everything
seems mixed properly compared to like

268
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,111
what now?

269
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,510
Like some guy in some THX labs like,

270
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:47,691
no,

271
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,610
I think this little jingle
over here should be louder.

272
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:49,970
You know,

273
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,280
I think I'm going to have
to get into fucking vinyl.

274
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,400
I think I'm going to have to buy a record
player and some headphones and listen

275
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:56,630
to what the fuck everybody's saying.

276
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,300
Because when you talk to
like real audio files,

277
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:04,070
they'll tell you that like a vinyl LP is
a way to go and then you lose something

278
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:04,904
in the sound.

279
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,850
When you go to CD you lose
like our quality a layer.

280
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,250
Can you even buy a record planning now?

281
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,270
These actually so records at best buy now.

282
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,781
Oh really?

283
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:14,614
Yeah.

284
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,670
The music industry is trying to find a
new thing and which one of the things

285
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,200
that's going retro going back to
vinyl because it sounds better,

286
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:20,560
whatever.

287
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,790
Yeah.

288
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,000
You know,

289
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,840
and that's all up to debate on my opinion.

290
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:23,710
How funny is that?

291
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,870
Like you think like old
TVs will make a comeback.

292
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,100
Wouldn't that be funny if you go in,

293
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:27,341
you're like,

294
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:28,390
this is not HD.

295
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,900
Yeah.

296
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,733
Well it seems like

297
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,510
get away with it with blueray where they
don't have to have compression anymore.

298
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:33,721
You know,

299
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,300
they have compression to
get it to CD to digitize it.

300
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,600
Like maybe they could add that quality
to it if they stretched it out and made

301
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:40,650
it a larger file.

302
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,613
I think they do.

303
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:41,950
Yeah.

304
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,520
I think flack or whatever that

305
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,040
version is,

306
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:50,230
I think that that is something that's
very close to it or what people can see.

307
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,580
It just depends how big
of a real audio people.

308
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,230
So the reason why I even brought it up,

309
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:58,250
but somebody on my message board made a
post suggesting that I put out my next

310
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,650
CD on vinyl and I'm like,

311
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:01,041
wow,

312
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,720
I've never even thought about doing that.

313
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:03,021
That's like,

314
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:04,910
it's kind of weird suggestion.

315
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:05,744
I might be kind of cool.

316
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,710
It is a cool idea.

317
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:07,191
It's kind of like,

318
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:08,840
I don't know if you heard about this,

319
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:11,480
but I guess Steven Wright is
writing a novel on Twitter.

320
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:11,950
Do you hear about it?

321
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,783
Did

322
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,211
you hear about this?

323
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:14,660
No,

324
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,520
he straight up like

325
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:15,821
he,

326
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:16,121
you know,

327
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,680
he found out he took,

328
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,341
you know how he's like,

329
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:20,290
I mean he's known for the shorter jokes,

330
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:20,531
right?

331
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:21,251
So they decided,

332
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:21,371
well,

333
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:22,660
Twitter is about being short,

334
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:23,710
so I'm going to write a novel.

335
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,870
So supposedly he's writing a novel.

336
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:29,020
And you can come in at any point and
you might not know what's going on.

337
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:29,501
He doesn't care.

338
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:31,000
He's just good album.

339
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,140
I have to follow him.

340
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:37,170
Is it Stephen or Steve with a v I think
is with The v actually I think steering

341
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,550
right but,

342
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,740
but,

343
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:38,890
but,

344
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,670
but based on,

345
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,050
but what I'm saying it's
like the same thing if you,

346
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,700
if you bust it out with like everyone
else is coming out with like the new hot,

347
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,260
I'm going to put my,

348
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,330
put my album out like this,

349
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:46,781
like that.

350
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:47,860
And you bust out with,

351
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,161
you know,

352
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,060
a record vinyl.

353
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,080
That might be a way to go.

354
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,943
This can't be him.

355
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,690
He only has 15,000 followers.

356
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,680
I Dunno.

357
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,513
I'm not sure.

358
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,380
Is that a real,

359
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,591
yeah,

360
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:56,100
that could probably

361
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,933
is about right.

362
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,540
How do you,

363
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,550
how could you find out if
it's the real deal or not?

364
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,930
Well usually they're verified.

365
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:05,580
I'm verified Joan Rivers right here
says it's verified follow Joan Rivers.

366
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,620
But Steven Wright doesn't say verified.

367
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,690
I'm going to take a chance
and following me anyway.

368
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,340
Cause I think a lot of those old school
guys like Steven Wright or probably just

369
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,810
now embracing technology,

370
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:17,100
so that might be a real number.

371
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:18,480
He might really only have seven.

372
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,810
We could rerelease her
website and bitmaps.

373
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,190
What does bitmaps instead
of jpegs we can go.

374
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,190
Really?

375
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,830
Yeah,

376
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,261
that'd be good.

377
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:25,550
Vinyl,

378
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,720
a photo cause discussion,

379
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,003
every crappy,

380
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:28,890
everything.

381
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,530
We all go back to like three second
video gifts instead of having Ustream,

382
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,670
we just have a Gif animation writing.

383
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:37,020
He is writing a novel writing a novel.

384
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:37,230
Right?

385
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,340
Oh this is hilarious.

386
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,811
He's hilarious.

387
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:41,430
He's writing a fucking novel on Twitter.

388
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,380
That's funny.

389
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,483
I can't wait to follow.

390
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,001
I heard that.

391
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:45,834
I was like,

392
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,171
I was like,

393
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,040
that's crazy.

394
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,300
That is such a great idea.

395
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,990
And he ends TBC on like every post to
be continued to be getting delirious.

396
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,180
He continued and you get to
just follow along with it.

397
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,380
This is so strange.

398
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,273
Isn't that crazy?

399
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,320
But addressing your question,

400
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,180
this was extremely tiring
for Harold because of his
attention with drift and for

401
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,940
some reason the abstract speech
that his mother was making,

402
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,140
like a toy train.

403
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:12,180
His brain would stay firmly on track,

404
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,260
weaving,

405
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,950
turning through it to be continued
previously unconnected subjects.

406
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,990
Harold had the opposite of add.

407
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,040
He needed to go go some
to some school somewhere.

408
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,170
Some typo needed to go,

409
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:29,220
some to some school somewhere and
learned how to space to be continued out

410
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,450
to be continued and then out
space to be continued out.

411
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,230
The last dream he had was about a man
who invented mirrors when howled workup

412
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,113
the next day,

413
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,700
all he could remember was
that he to be continued,

414
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,040
had a dream about us.

415
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,920
Like this is ridiculous.

416
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,050
This is definitely him.

417
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,080
This is definitely happen.

418
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,790
But this is one of the weirdest things
I've ever heard anybody doing that.

419
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,860
Steve writes a maniac.

420
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,321
You know,

421
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:56,220
he was the guy who was single handedly
his success through this monkey wrench

422
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:57,270
into the whole,

423
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:57,600
uh,

424
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,770
Boston comedy scene.

425
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,731
There's a,

426
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:01,830
there's a great documentary by this guy,

427
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:02,940
Fran Salameda.

428
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,163
Fuck.

429
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,240
I'd have to look it up
with the name of it is.

430
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,060
Have you ever worked with them before?

431
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,470
Yeah.

432
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,240
Fran was a comic from Boston,

433
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:13,980
Boston Combo.

434
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,510
How did he throw a wrench into the scene?

435
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,430
Because he got successful.

436
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,473
And um,

437
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,250
when he got successful,

438
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:22,740
everybody kind of
freaked out and was like,

439
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:23,251
what Stan went,

440
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,001
standups stood out.

441
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:24,834
That's what it's called.

442
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,140
Bob Boston was this incredible
place where there was so many great,

443
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:31,470
great comedians that were local guys
and they would just work locally,

444
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:32,304
constantly.

445
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,700
And all of a sudden Steven Wright got
discovered and Steven Wright started doing

446
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:37,860
Letterman and Carson
and everybody was like,

447
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:38,610
Holy Shit.

448
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,860
Then he got his HBO special
and then everybody was like,

449
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:41,694
where's mine?

450
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,960
When is this going to happen for me?

451
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,100
And it kind of like changed the tone
of the town because it used to be this

452
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,083
almost like,

453
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,740
I want to say artists' colony,

454
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:51,930
but not so fucking gay.

455
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,610
They were savages.

456
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,571
They were crazy.

457
00:11:55,571 --> 00:11:56,500
Coke's Norton,

458
00:11:56,501 --> 00:12:00,310
we'd Smolkin whiskey drink and animals
and they were fucking hilarious.

459
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:04,060
And they were just doing
it to make everybody laugh
and to get by and get paid.

460
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,110
But then all of a sudden,

461
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:05,460
you know,

462
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:05,770
the,

463
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,091
the,

464
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:06,550
the,

465
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,550
the dream sort of appeared
in Steven Wright form.

466
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,301
Steven,

467
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:10,481
right?

468
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:13,030
All of a sudden became fucking
huge at famous and rational.

469
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,110
And these guys were like,

470
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:14,351
yeah,

471
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:15,131
Steven's good,

472
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:16,480
but I'm fucking good too.

473
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,350
You know?

474
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,510
And it kind of changed the
whole tone of the town.

475
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:19,721
You know,

476
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,940
guys started like really
working towards deals,

477
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,300
you know,

478
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,740
I mean it's not necessarily a bad thing,

479
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:24,381
but it became,

480
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:24,580
you know,

481
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,540
that it became,

482
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,010
there was a different goal on the horizon.

483
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:28,030
It wasn't just being funny.

484
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,460
It was crazy how success
can get in the way of art.

485
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,030
Yes.

486
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,490
And often does often
does but doesn't have to,

487
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,030
you know,

488
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,863
manageable.

489
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,011
It's a manageable,

490
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:36,491
like people say,

491
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:37,420
oh you sold out.

492
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:38,350
I'm like shut up stupid.

493
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,760
You don't even know what
you're talking about.

494
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,680
As long as you're still doing good stuff.

495
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,811
Part of it is like,

496
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:43,531
I mean like with you,

497
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:44,430
I mean I know like,

498
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:44,970
you know,

499
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,980
seeing you at the comedy
store when I first was,

500
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:47,210
you know,

501
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,150
when I first was starting,

502
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:48,511
they're like,

503
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,210
the good thing about you is even when
you had a show or anything going,

504
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,770
you still kept that mentality of I've got
to get up and create and write and you

505
00:12:55,771 --> 00:12:56,581
continue to do that.

506
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:59,910
And so the idea is you can get out of
that quote unquote artists' colony,

507
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:00,750
you know,

508
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,411
with success.

509
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:02,191
But then you within,

510
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:03,360
you remind yourself,

511
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,221
it's like a boxer.

512
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:04,951
I got to keep training.

513
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:05,410
You know?

514
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,220
It's also,

515
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,630
I think your motivation changes.

516
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:09,310
Your motivation goes from the bean.

517
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,780
The motivation of a odd,

518
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:11,770
just trying to make it,

519
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:12,610
I want success,

520
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:13,480
I want to be,

521
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:13,901
you know,

522
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,310
recognized too.

523
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,240
You get some success,

524
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:16,571
then you go,

525
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:16,841
okay,

526
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:18,070
now I just want to do good stuff.

527
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,940
I just want to have fun.

528
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,100
Now my interest is just on the jokes.

529
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,390
It's just in creating the new bit,

530
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,570
just not putting the act together and
it actually becomes more fun that way.

531
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:26,641
Is it?

532
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:28,110
When you do like and you get,

533
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:30,090
so when you call it with a bit
or something that you'd let him,

534
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,820
it's like it's as good as getting
a big paycheck where you're like,

535
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:32,911
oh,

536
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:33,361
that was cool.

537
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:34,140
I mean it's even,

538
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,771
they were saying like,

539
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:35,970
I mean it's just,

540
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,380
you're so excited about it,

541
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,100
you know?

542
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,250
And it's because it doesn't always co
one of the problems of success as it

543
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:45,990
becomes harder to write in newer stuff
unless if you put yourself in those lab

544
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,090
kind of situations where you're saying,

545
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:48,331
okay,

546
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:50,070
I'm going to work out some new stuff.

547
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,790
You know when people come expecting
you to always gonna you know,

548
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,410
do those killer whatever things,

549
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:56,244
you know.

550
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:56,600
Yeah,

551
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:56,781
yeah,

552
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:56,991
yeah.

553
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:57,591
That's a problem.

554
00:13:57,591 --> 00:13:58,190
But you know,

555
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,670
that's fun.

556
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,570
It's a fun problem.

557
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,710
It's,

558
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,640
it's a tester but it's fantastic.

559
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,270
It's one of the reasons why we like doing
that sounds comedy hall to this real

560
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:05,930
small,

561
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,880
it's like 80 people and I just,

562
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:11,150
I'll fuck around and not even know what
I'm really going to say about something

563
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,950
and they know that
that's what you're doing.

564
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,280
They know that you're fucking around a
lot and I do most of my real bits too.

565
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,080
I want to give them solid stand up,

566
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,230
but I also want to use the opportunity
to fuck around and stretch out.

567
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,880
I never do a full,

568
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,060
like a full sacrifice set.

569
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,630
I won't like go up there with
only new bits and just eat dick.

570
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,460
I don't like doing that man.

571
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,260
I don't think they like it either.

572
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,210
The only time,

573
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:34,421
uh,

574
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,420
I've recently tried
something like that is a,

575
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,040
the laugh factory was doing some
with Kevin Nealon on Tuesdays.

576
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:39,260
We were,

577
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,330
was known as seven minutes in new material
and then Kevin Nealon comes on stage

578
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:44,840
and sits with you and Kinda,

579
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:45,731
he's a funny guy.

580
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:48,790
He kind of risks with you and kind of
like makes fun of the material but also

581
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,890
gives you some ideas and uh,

582
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:51,800
and the audience,

583
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,690
well they're supposed to know that
that's what they're there for.

584
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:54,161
Half the audit,

585
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:55,010
whenever I go up there and go,

586
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:56,690
how many you guys knew
you were coming for this?

587
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:57,830
And like two or three people clap.

588
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:58,970
The rest of the thought was a real show.

589
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,280
But the idea is you're supposed to go
up with seven minutes of brand new,

590
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,360
like never try.

591
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:06,120
So what I,

592
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,190
every time I've gone up there,

593
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:10,220
I've liked just gone into my blackberry
and looked at the ideas I've had that

594
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:11,990
I've just put down that
I haven't riffed on.

595
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,320
I just go up and riff
and it's so much now.

596
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,480
He never had and beautiful and
real and good things come out of,

597
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,090
yeah.

598
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,410
You know gotta take chances,

599
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:19,681
man.

600
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:20,970
That's a standup comedy is one.

601
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:22,770
That's one of the most
important things about it.

602
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:23,670
Constantly moving,

603
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,080
constantly taking chances.

604
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:26,520
Some new thing comes out in the news.

605
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,610
Get onstage that day
when with Anthony Wiener,

606
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,990
when when the ship went down,

607
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,160
I went on stage that night and had 10 new
minutes cause I was just writing about

608
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:35,581
it all day.

609
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:36,510
How ridiculous it was.

610
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:40,990
I was just laughing and we're living in
a fucking Coen brothers movie manner.

611
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:41,700
No,

612
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,533
I'm good.

613
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,340
It's even now steady number.

614
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,260
Fucking guys name his wiener and he's
taking pictures of his Dick and sending

615
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:49,681
get to women.

616
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:50,310
I mean it's,

617
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,140
it doesn't even seem
like it could be real.

618
00:15:52,141 --> 00:15:52,500
I know.

619
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,221
It's ridiculous.

620
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:54,240
It was a movie you would go,

621
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:55,290
that's shitty writing.

622
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,041
This is through right?

623
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:56,191
Yeah.

624
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:56,671
Come on dude.

625
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,370
You gotta go another name here.

626
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,620
It's like whenever these senators
get caught doing gay shit,

627
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,020
it's always the same thing I
think is anti gay senators.

628
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:05,040
They get called gay and out.

629
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:05,430
You're like,

630
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,221
goddammit man,

631
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:07,620
it's it is it that easy?

632
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,640
Yeah.

633
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,081
What the fuck?

634
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,140
And this is the solution.

635
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,370
This is really what's going on.

636
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,050
Well there's so much of that going on now.

637
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:13,884
It seems like I just,

638
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,820
they just had a,

639
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,130
I just saw Andrew is Andrew Cuomo,

640
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,090
Mario Cuomo son.

641
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,830
He's now the governor of New York is,

642
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,480
I think it's Andrew or I think anyway,

643
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,240
governor Cuomo was up
there talking about some,

644
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:24,570
he was,

645
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,280
they just showed a clip
of him and I was like,

646
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,151
Oh man,

647
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:28,020
cause he seems like he's,

648
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:28,740
he's like,

649
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,790
he's a Cuomo.

650
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,780
He kind of has like,

651
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,060
seems like he's legit
right in back of my mind.

652
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:33,420
I'm like,

653
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,160
I hope he's not banging some lady.

654
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:35,431
I was like,

655
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:36,000
it's going to come.

656
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,330
I was like,

657
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,081
cause it almost,

658
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,780
if it's a lady he could live
through with light duty,

659
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:40,680
but you know,

660
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:41,431
now you can't even live.

661
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:42,260
I mean it's like,

662
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,380
you know the wiener,

663
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:43,981
we don't know.

664
00:16:43,981 --> 00:16:44,371
I mean did he,

665
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,380
do he actually have sex with him?

666
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,480
It was just like sending
pictures of his penis a freak.

667
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:49,314
He's just a freak.

668
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:49,661
Yeah.

669
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:50,730
So now he's got,

670
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,720
so what I'm saying is like,

671
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:52,081
you can't,

672
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:52,361
like if,

673
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:57,180
if government give governor Cuomo Cuomo
Cuomo were found to be having an affair,

674
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:57,830
he's done.

675
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,260
I mean,

676
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:58,650
can't,

677
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,041
yes,

678
00:16:59,041 --> 00:16:59,761
I agree with you.

679
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:00,061
Yeah.

680
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:00,511
And you know,

681
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:01,201
in this day and age,

682
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:04,470
this is really going to be a time real
soon where there's no one left to run for

683
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:04,791
office.

684
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,400
It's funny,

685
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,720
everybody's got fucking Skelton's.

686
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:07,431
That's hilarious.

687
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:09,000
Do you think that wiener during the whole,

688
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,730
that whole week before he stepped down,

689
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:12,301
do you think he was like,

690
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:14,520
please let there be a
death deadly hurricane.

691
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,010
Please let there be an
earthquake in Africa.

692
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:17,844
What the fuck?

693
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,840
Right.

694
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,970
Gary condit thing.

695
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:21,600
Remember when nine 11 happened?

696
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:23,520
You remember Gary Condit and Chandra Levy?

697
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,740
Chandra Levy was his assistant.

698
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:26,700
She turned out missing.

699
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:29,190
Everybody thought he killed her because
he was having an affair with her.

700
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,780
There was all this craziness.

701
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:31,141
And then,

702
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:31,440
you know,

703
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,430
they found her body,

704
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:32,891
you know,

705
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:33,310
and,

706
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,143
but he got off,

707
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,473
he got off on it.

708
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:35,950
Yeah.

709
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,600
My God.

710
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:36,801
Yeah.

711
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:39,740
And they apparently connected
her murder to a bar.

712
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,700
A guy had killed the
few women in that area,

713
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:43,180
so it might've actually been legit.

714
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,180
Serial killer.

715
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,650
Okay,

716
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,420
well who the fuck

717
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,400
it's that concept that you
had this kind of fight.

718
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,700
You should riff on that about pretty
soon there'd be no one left to run and

719
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:50,821
it'll,

720
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,320
it'll be like the most unsexy,

721
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:52,921
evil people.

722
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:53,090
Like,

723
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,881
so someone,

724
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,170
no one wants to have any sex with.

725
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:57,270
Like you gotta get like
really ugly kind of like,

726
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,000
you know,

727
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,760
just like wardee people like you,

728
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:01,050
you gotta you gotta be someone that's not,

729
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,330
no one's attracted to the
run cause they're like,

730
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:05,130
well there's no way no
anyone had sex with that guy.

731
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,670
I think it's going to come down
to a point real soon where we've,

732
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,400
we have to come to grips with the
fact that everybody that wants to be

733
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:11,911
president,

734
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:13,960
anybody that wants to
be in control like that,

735
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,950
there's some serious like sexual
weirdness going on with you.

736
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:18,240
That's some domination shit.

737
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,230
You want to run things.

738
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:19,690
Yeah.

739
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,740
But also with power,

740
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:21,370
I mean that's like,

741
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,810
I mean that's part of like the,

742
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:23,141
you know,

743
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:24,420
that's part of what comes with it.

744
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:24,681
I mean,

745
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:25,540
it was funny too,

746
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,920
was the one that uh,

747
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,390
Dominique stress con when they,

748
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:29,500
when the IMF guy,

749
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,121
yes.

750
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:30,311
Yeah.

751
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:31,280
What was funny was they were,

752
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,110
I don't know,

753
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,790
explain the story.

754
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,820
Does that make strides in the trashcan
was the president of the IMF and a,

755
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:40,810
he staying at the Sofitel hotel
and a $3,000 a night suite,

756
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,730
he's also supposedly going to be the next
possible possible president of France.

757
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:47,410
So he's being geared up for that.

758
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,790
And so the maid comes in to clean the
place and he shows up naked and he

759
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,310
basically think he chased her around
and tried to rape her or something.

760
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,210
Fuck their mouth.

761
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,200
Did he?

762
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,801
Oh my God.

763
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:57,161
So he,

764
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:57,994
so he,

765
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,230
whatever he meant.

766
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,760
So the story,

767
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:01,960
who knows what really happened,

768
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:02,171
but,

769
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:02,481
but the,

770
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:03,570
but the thing it was funny is,

771
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:04,870
so he's a French dude and then,

772
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:05,471
and of course,

773
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:05,711
you know,

774
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,440
then he tried and then he tried to leave
the country should say allegedly fucked

775
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:08,920
her mouth,

776
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,421
allegedly.

777
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:09,890
Is it out?

778
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,601
I'll say allegedly.

779
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:10,701
Yeah.

780
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:11,310
Well that's,

781
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,280
that's what our sources,

782
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,750
that's what are sources have told us.

783
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,650
The Internet.

784
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:14,831
Yeah.

785
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:15,664
The Internet.

786
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,110
I didn't look into that at all,

787
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,311
but,

788
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:18,581
but,

789
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:18,910
um,

790
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,211
but,

791
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:19,570
uh,

792
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,141
but the point,

793
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:20,974
but what's funny is,

794
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,150
is I was reading this,

795
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:23,260
some of the French,

796
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:24,590
the French reaction were there,

797
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:25,180
they were like,

798
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,871
they were saying like,

799
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:26,530
well,

800
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,120
the French aren't that
phased by the whole,

801
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:28,451
they're like,

802
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:29,860
they expect their politician to be,

803
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:30,041
oh,

804
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,200
if you're a politician and
France isn't bang in somebody,

805
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:33,010
then it's weird.

806
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:33,460
Right.

807
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,293
You know what I'm saying?

808
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,313
You know?

809
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,561
Well,

810
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:36,150
you know,

811
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,380
uh,

812
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,001
there's a,

813
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,830
there's a thing that we've talked about
on this podcast before called toxo

814
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:41,470
plasma and it's a,

815
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:41,681
a,

816
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:46,150
a cat parasite that infects a human
beings and changes their behavior.

817
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,700
And it makes men reckless.

818
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,470
It makes men very aggressive and
reckless makes them do crazy shit.

819
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,191
And,

820
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:51,510
uh,

821
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,290
there's a huge population of a,

822
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:57,030
a high rate of infection
rather in France and Francis,

823
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,873
like 80%,

824
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,950
80% of the people are infected by this
toxoplasma as much as 80% in some areas.

825
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,430
GS,

826
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,210
which is insane.

827
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:04,461
And it,

828
00:20:04,461 --> 00:20:04,990
it's uh,

829
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,630
it's a parasite and it's just to
management as you men and women,

830
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,500
sex women.

831
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,170
But the women,

832
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,910
it's tougher to document how it affects
women because they think it makes them

833
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:13,744
more submissive.

834
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,400
But with,

835
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,011
with men,

836
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:18,520
it makes them aggressive jerks
and makes them really reckless.

837
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:19,480
That explains a lot.

838
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:19,900
Yeah.

839
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,370
You went to smoke something and catch it.

840
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,980
So that's why like pregnant women
aren't supposed to touch cat shit.

841
00:20:26,981 --> 00:20:28,720
If they are telling that to
your wife when she was pregnant,

842
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,010
don't touch any kitty litter.

843
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,720
Don't ever go near any cats.

844
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,260
Oh Wow.

845
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,500
It's why because of a this toxoplasma
but huge percentage of people.

846
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,780
I mean if this guy has
toxo if he's from France,

847
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,980
I mean he might make them loked out
where he just whips his dick out on the

848
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:41,500
main.

849
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,333
That'd be great.

850
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,211
That'd be a great,

851
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:43,621
uh,

852
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:45,310
a plea and the court be like,

853
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,280
I have toxoplasma plasma know,

854
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,940
feel free to use it.

855
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:50,330
I'll be honored if you guys use that.

856
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,510
Uh,

857
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,650
that maybe I possibly had
some [inaudible] saying.

858
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,220
So plasma defense,

859
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,510
it's um,

860
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,470
it's very possible.

861
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:57,740
I would like to see this guy tested.

862
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:57,971
I mean,

863
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:00,460
if he really did so do something
fucking reckless and crazy.

864
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,740
But I think anybody who wants to be
in a position of power like that,

865
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:04,420
a lot of them have sexual things.

866
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,273
You know,

867
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,290
Clinton would just whip his
dick out on girls crazy is that,

868
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,590
it's just where he was the president.

869
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:11,620
He would just whip his dick on it.

870
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:14,860
State troopers and
fucking good typists and

871
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,560
great Terry.

872
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,151
You know what I was thinking?

873
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,320
I was thinking like all these guys,

874
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:18,490
like when you get to that level of power,

875
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:19,080
you should have like,

876
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,420
uh,

877
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,290
like I was thinking you should have like
a counselor that's walking around with

878
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:23,831
you 24,

879
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:25,090
seven and you're like,

880
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:25,241
Hey,

881
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:26,680
I think I'm about to whip out my dick.

882
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:27,220
And like,

883
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,240
that's not a good idea.

884
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:28,701
Well,

885
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:30,730
what's funny is I realized
if you ever were a dude,

886
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,940
the dude evasive,

887
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,321
I'd be like,

888
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:32,740
yeah,

889
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,573
what about your Dick?

890
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,350
Let's just like go to mind.

891
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,570
You said totally do that.

892
00:21:36,571 --> 00:21:37,370
That'd be awesome.

893
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,720
You want to bang the made you
should totally being the mayor,

894
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,060
the president IMF washed.

895
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,660
Yeah.

896
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,830
How about Arnold man?

897
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:44,730
Oh my God.

898
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,211
How about that?

899
00:21:45,211 --> 00:21:45,911
Crazy ass all.

900
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:47,850
Just fucking everyone who's in his house.

901
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:48,960
How funny is that?

902
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,771
If you're in his house,

903
00:21:49,771 --> 00:21:50,311
he fucks you.

904
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:51,240
That's just the rule.

905
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,540
Yeah,

906
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,373
no,

907
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,850
he was fucking her for 10 years,

908
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:54,181
man.

909
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:54,481
Crazy.

910
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,370
And she was not attract.

911
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,021
Oh,

912
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:56,910
it didn't matter.

913
00:21:56,911 --> 00:21:57,251
What do you like?

914
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:57,900
I'm a hard on it.

915
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,890
She was like cleaning is like,

916
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,710
I must do,

917
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,830
you know is like he just
bent over and I mean it's,

918
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:02,471
it's ridiculous.

919
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:02,741
I was,

920
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:05,020
I jokingly said like maybe he's
trying to save money on childcare.

921
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:05,141
Like,

922
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:05,974
you know,

923
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,210
have a baby with a nanny.

924
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,710
She's got to take care of his free,

925
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,960
you know,

926
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,260
Arnold is probably like
when he started banging her,

927
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:15,370
I mean he was so big,

928
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:15,731
you know,

929
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:17,200
when he was bodybuilding
in and be like that.

930
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,570
And there's only one way to do that
and you have to be on steroids,

931
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,740
you have to be on testosterone.

932
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,420
And Arnold was like,

933
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:22,900
you know,

934
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,640
known allegedly for being a guy who would
take just fucking massive quantities

935
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:28,474
of everything.

936
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,130
That's why he was so huge.

937
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,750
You look at the photos of him back when
he was Mister Olympia and holy fucking

938
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:35,584
shit.

939
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,780
Well you know the levels of testosterone,

940
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:39,520
that guy must have been taken
where probably through the roof.

941
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,110
So he probably just would fuck everything.

942
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,973
Oh yeah,

943
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,480
Naomi,

944
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,313
I fuck you.

945
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,243
This is everything.

946
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,731
Doesn't that,

947
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:48,570
doesn't that lower your sex drive or are
supposed to like make your penis while

948
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:48,880
what happened?

949
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,050
Cause we lowers your body's natural
production of testosterone because if you

950
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:56,560
inject a bunch of testosterone in your
body and you bring it over a certain

951
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:58,000
baseline when your body is like,

952
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,190
what the fuck is all this
task doing around here?

953
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,020
So your body says we don't
have to use the ball.

954
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:05,530
Shut the balls down so your body shuts
the balls down because you're squirting

955
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:08,500
into your body 10 times a
natural level of testosterone.

956
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:10,600
So you can get a 30 inch fucking arms.

957
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,201
You know the,

958
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:11,361
the,

959
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:13,870
when you see guys like that
and you watch them pose,

960
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:14,651
you ever see them pose?

961
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:15,070
Yeah.

962
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,700
They have the tiniest balls
you've ever seen in your life.

963
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:18,930
Like,

964
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,100
well,

965
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,550
I would be terrified if
my balls were that small.

966
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,050
And if you see those dudes
in those little lines,

967
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,570
m and m done,

968
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,170
I'm going to be their
balls or nonexistent.

969
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,530
It's like the ball's wither away.

970
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,393
I would love it.

971
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,940
I think my boss.

972
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,103
Do you have any

973
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,390
gross things that are
hanging from my awesome Dick?

974
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:39,224
You know,

975
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,160
I'd rather have two small little
cute ball things attached to it.

976
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:45,770
Then these big droopy old man throats,

977
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:45,980
I don't

978
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,510
know what the fuck man throw balls.

979
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,340
I have pretty average sized balls.

980
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:49,850
I'm not that.

981
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,110
Oh,

982
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,160
I don't have big Brah live.

983
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,500
He had elephant balls and you were like,

984
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:56,090
I gotta get rid of these elephant balls.

985
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:57,170
I'm happy with my balls.

986
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,130
I'm cool.

987
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,930
Scratching your balls as
best feeling in the world.

988
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,120
I used to think my balls were big until
I saw always balls and Joey Diaz his

989
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:03,740
balls.

990
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,341
Oh yeah.

991
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:04,761
And then I'm like,

992
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:04,911
yeah,

993
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:05,870
my balls are not that big.

994
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,380
Those balls were ridiculous to use.

995
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,270
It has huge pause.

996
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:11,020
But res has one that are
trying to escape his body ball.

997
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:12,740
It's like they looked like worms almost.

998
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,490
Well,

999
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,570
they sag way lower than
they're supposed to.

1000
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,220
Yeah.

1001
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:16,491
When our,

1002
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:17,330
he pulls his balls out,

1003
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:17,541
you're like,

1004
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,321
what the fuck you,

1005
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:19,310
you go to a doctor,

1006
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:19,880
dude,

1007
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,430
one day old and sagging.

1008
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,590
Joey's balls look like
they belong on Joey.

1009
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,900
You know everything
about him as a cartoon.

1010
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,763
Cuban egg roll.

1011
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,160
So of course his balls look like
softballs and old ladies pantyhose.

1012
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:31,851
You know,

1013
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:32,181
it's like,

1014
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,050
that's what it looks like.

1015
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:35,660
You would have this big giant ball,

1016
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,411
one ball,

1017
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:37,920
like a fucking speed bag.

1018
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:40,760
Yo.

1019
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,840
D as a classic.

1020
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,880
He's a human like no other.

1021
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,631
This is very few.

1022
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:46,790
Joey Diaz is out there roaming the planet.

1023
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:47,571
I always,

1024
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:48,210
every time I seen him,

1025
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:48,351
like,

1026
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:49,730
why isn't there just a show?

1027
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:50,780
Just following him around.

1028
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,141
I know,

1029
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:51,770
right?

1030
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,441
He says this,

1031
00:24:52,441 --> 00:24:53,670
this weekend I was with them and like,

1032
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,430
we're in the van going from the hotel,

1033
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:57,440
two blocks go from the hotel to the venue.

1034
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,140
You're in the,

1035
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,040
like some people crossing the
street in front of everyone else,

1036
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,040
kind of sit in the joy.

1037
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,630
This,

1038
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,920
hurry up your cock sucker.

1039
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,360
I'm gonna take my fucking cock.

1040
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,220
[inaudible] and the funniest formation
of words come together and everyone was

1041
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,340
just cracking up.

1042
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,520
I would like to see the things
that we don't know about Joe.

1043
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,500
You know there's points
where he just sings,

1044
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:19,334
you know,

1045
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,720
opera songs,

1046
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,101
cats,

1047
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:22,934
man.

1048
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,430
Most plasma ever.

1049
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,130
Oh,

1050
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,680
he's got all for these,

1051
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:29,330
there's like three forums
and talk to a plasma.

1052
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,291
He's out all three.

1053
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:30,530
Four.

1054
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,010
Yeah,

1055
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,581
he's got it all.

1056
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:33,200
You see I'm fucking eight cats.

1057
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,160
[inaudible] cats in his house.

1058
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:34,981
Didn't just get a new one.

1059
00:25:34,981 --> 00:25:35,570
You've got a new computer.

1060
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,440
We've got 11 now.

1061
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,920
I'm pretty sure it's in like
a two bedroom apartment.

1062
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,000
11 cats.

1063
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,420
Wow.

1064
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:41,631
Dude.

1065
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:44,060
I get a big house and I have
two cats and they drive me nuts.

1066
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:46,640
These little motherfuckers
shitting all over the place.

1067
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,571
It's annoying,

1068
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:47,751
man.

1069
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:49,730
My office smells like
cat shit all the time.

1070
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,730
I always got a clue.

1071
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,590
I was like cat shit cause they just take
stinky dumps in there and it's gross.

1072
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:57,920
I've got to clean it out and fucking w
and then they take a shit an hour later

1073
00:25:57,921 --> 00:25:59,100
like you motherfucker,

1074
00:25:59,150 --> 00:25:59,581
I hate it.

1075
00:25:59,581 --> 00:26:01,670
So I'm taking out my
fucking house gets gross.

1076
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:01,881
Right.

1077
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:02,630
I hate it.

1078
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,090
My place is so small and so I
had to have it in the kitchen.

1079
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,320
So I'm like cooking last night and that
is my cat takes a shit and then it's

1080
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:08,491
like,

1081
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:13,010
you know fucking food mixed with Shit
and they spray it and then that now it

1082
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:15,050
smells like a lemon forest full of shit.

1083
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,080
They don't have like,

1084
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,481
cause we don't,

1085
00:26:16,481 --> 00:26:16,911
I don't have,

1086
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,620
I'm allergic to cats so we don't have,

1087
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:22,400
but we have a neighborhood cats and
they always go in our back yard and they

1088
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:22,791
shit.

1089
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:23,421
No they shit.

1090
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:24,201
And I never knew,

1091
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:27,680
I never had cats so I thought cat
shit was like little like bunny shit.

1092
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:29,210
Now it's like serious shit.

1093
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:33,470
I'm constantly like snoop Dogg was here
and my cat has this thing where like

1094
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:36,020
they pee on certain
sides of the litter box,

1095
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:40,560
like the P my cat pees right in front
of the opening so it has to put it too,

1096
00:26:40,561 --> 00:26:44,550
but like right out the door of that litter
box and he had shit the other day and

1097
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:46,170
just sprayed my wall was shit.

1098
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,030
Oh God,

1099
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:49,350
there's such dirty little animals.

1100
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,270
And you know when you
let them out in the wild,

1101
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:53,280
that's when you gotta be
worried about Toxoplasma.

1102
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,700
Yeah.

1103
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,481
That's when they catch it.

1104
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:55,261
They catch it from,

1105
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:57,390
from rats out in the wild.

1106
00:26:57,391 --> 00:26:59,130
So it'd become dangerous.

1107
00:26:59,131 --> 00:26:59,460
It can,

1108
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,151
it can fuck with you.

1109
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,920
And it's very dangerous
for little children.

1110
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,080
Very dangerous for babies
and shit like that.

1111
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,550
They're immune system's not ready for it.

1112
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,120
Oh really?

1113
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,870
Yeah.

1114
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,950
Creepy fucking cats and dogs
aren't even better than I,

1115
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:11,970
it's ridiculous.

1116
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:12,330
Dog.

1117
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,230
My dog lately has been digging up shit
and in the hiding bones in there and

1118
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:18,210
putting it like just cartoon style,

1119
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,930
like digging holes and it got in a fight
with like a possum the other day or

1120
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,764
something like that.

1121
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,780
And I don't even know what it had.

1122
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:28,590
It looked like maybe a baby of some kind
all chewed up and brought it into the

1123
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:31,960
house and just left it right
on these pee pads that we,

1124
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,560
awesome baby possum.

1125
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,150
I don't know what the fuck it was so tiny.

1126
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:38,670
If your dog killed something and
it's gotta be little as fuck.

1127
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,290
Yeah.

1128
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:39,830
Yeah.

1129
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,260
It's not,

1130
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,861
what does your dog wait?

1131
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:41,970
Like five pounds or something.

1132
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,380
Eight pounds.

1133
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,550
She's so small.

1134
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,780
How could she kill anything?

1135
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,890
What can she kill?

1136
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,960
I think it was probably dead already,

1137
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,490
but she decided to eat it,

1138
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,490
but she brought it in and
Laid It on the pee pad.

1139
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:54,410
Like she thought it was pooped.

1140
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:55,800
So that's kind of cool.

1141
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,610
But still it's like I don't want dead
corpses and fucking shit on my walls while

1142
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,444
I'm cooking.

1143
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,490
Keep the dog outside.

1144
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:03,324
Well not that dog.

1145
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,520
You can't a hawk come
and swap that sucker up.

1146
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,140
And what if I were to buy a huge dog
house or make a dog house that was big

1147
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:10,770
enough,

1148
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,101
you know,

1149
00:28:11,101 --> 00:28:13,560
to let the dog stay in there for ever.

1150
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:15,361
Listen man.

1151
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,440
That dog needs people.

1152
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,070
You've got a dog that needs
a lot of human attention.

1153
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,040
You can't do that.

1154
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,500
You can't leave.

1155
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,071
We're outside.

1156
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:21,760
So my crazy,

1157
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,580
we've never been dogged
people and my are animals.

1158
00:28:24,581 --> 00:28:25,420
Like I never had animals.

1159
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:25,900
My My,

1160
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,290
my kid loves dogs and we thought
about for minute getting one.

1161
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,910
But then I realized that I'd just be,

1162
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,280
I'd have to take care of the dog
because my kids three years old,

1163
00:28:33,281 --> 00:28:34,114
he's not going to do it.

1164
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,290
Kids will tell you,

1165
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:35,651
oh,

1166
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:36,461
I love dogs.

1167
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:37,960
I'm definitely going
to take care of it dad.

1168
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,100
Next thing you know you're walking that
fucking thing every day are my boy has

1169
00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:43,690
like he is just fearless.

1170
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:44,800
She'll go up to any dog.

1171
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:47,670
Like when he was like one and a
half we went to some family friends,

1172
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:51,700
they had like a rottweiler big scary
looking and he was up there trying to kiss

1173
00:28:51,701 --> 00:28:52,061
it and we're like,

1174
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:52,181
no,

1175
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:52,301
no,

1176
00:28:52,301 --> 00:28:52,750
no.

1177
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,321
But he was just,

1178
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:54,220
he goes for it.

1179
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,390
I don't trust dogs.

1180
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:55,811
Oh yeah,

1181
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:56,390
no maybes.

1182
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,690
Because they get confused
and think babies are dogs.

1183
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,590
Oh my God,

1184
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,341
that's the problem.

1185
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:02,080
They don't associate
that with being a person.

1186
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:02,801
So they'll,

1187
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:05,440
they'll like check a baby just
to let a baby now you know,

1188
00:29:05,441 --> 00:29:06,041
like check a baby.

1189
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:06,874
Like they were checking dogs.

1190
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,800
Don't fucking my territory.

1191
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,450
I've seen dogs do that before.

1192
00:29:10,451 --> 00:29:11,020
It's Carrie.

1193
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,691
I was going to,

1194
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:12,730
if you ever eaten at that place,

1195
00:29:12,731 --> 00:29:17,050
toast and on third over there and like
near West Hollywood is good but good plus

1196
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,100
cause food and they uh,

1197
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,220
we were going with a friend of mine and
go sit down one time and we're about to

1198
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:21,691
sit in this,

1199
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:23,710
this girl like five year old girl,

1200
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,250
you know,

1201
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,450
cute little blonde girl,

1202
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,230
five year old and she's got
like a little bloody nose going.

1203
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:29,860
And I was like,

1204
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,270
oh poor girl fell or something.

1205
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:35,560
And then as we're sitting we sit next
to this dog and the story comes out that

1206
00:29:35,561 --> 00:29:39,100
she was up there playing and the
dog bit it or knows and cutter.

1207
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:39,690
Whoa.

1208
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,061
And we're like,

1209
00:29:40,061 --> 00:29:40,301
okay,

1210
00:29:40,301 --> 00:29:41,650
we don't want to sit to this dog.

1211
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:42,760
This dog was,

1212
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,121
it was,

1213
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:44,050
it looked like a regular,

1214
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,010
it wasn't any kind of like,

1215
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:45,510
it was like a,

1216
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,510
it wasn't golden retriever,

1217
00:29:46,511 --> 00:29:47,321
but it was like a regular,

1218
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:48,140
like it wasn't like,

1219
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,700
like a month.

1220
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:48,851
Yeah.

1221
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:50,350
It wasn't anything to fucking girl.

1222
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:51,400
And the face a girl,

1223
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:51,891
I don't know what,

1224
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:54,580
what she did or what happened
to the dog was still alive.

1225
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,870
Nobody had beaten it to death.

1226
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:56,150
Yeah.

1227
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:56,411
Yeah.

1228
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:56,921
You would think,

1229
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:57,240
right?

1230
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,350
Yeah.

1231
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,770
I don't know.

1232
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,380
Bite a five year old baby.

1233
00:29:59,510 --> 00:29:59,980
Yeah,

1234
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,150
you fucking cunt dog.

1235
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,600
I'll kick you to death.

1236
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:02,950
Yeah.

1237
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,270
So I'm always worried with my son,

1238
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:04,451
man.

1239
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:04,901
He just went,

1240
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:05,140
yeah,

1241
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,080
you gotta be real careful.

1242
00:30:06,081 --> 00:30:06,900
It was right up there.

1243
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,900
You got to always think that a dog will
consider your baby to be an animal.

1244
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,470
Yeah,

1245
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:11,860
they don't,

1246
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,800
they don't consider it to be a person
cause it's not talking really in a real

1247
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:16,250
little and they're high pitched voice.

1248
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,320
It's like this is not the same thing.

1249
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,360
I see Mazda Brawny he
could tell me what to do.

1250
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:20,270
Well this is a little motherfucker.

1251
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,530
Tell him,

1252
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,150
tell him what's the deal,

1253
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:21,431
bitch.

1254
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:22,264
Fuck them up.

1255
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,680
Try to take my food.

1256
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:24,800
Tend to her dog for a bit.

1257
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,300
Yeah.

1258
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,380
I've had the worst week.

1259
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:28,570
There's this bird that's
outside in my tree,

1260
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,980
like the animal kingdom.

1261
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:30,731
You had a cat,

1262
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:31,271
a dog.

1263
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:32,020
Now the bird,

1264
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,853
this bird,

1265
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,850
I don't know what it is,

1266
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:37,570
but every time it gets dark it goes
through like 12 different chirp things.

1267
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:37,870
Like it's like,

1268
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,000
it sounds like somebody
breaking into a car,

1269
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,053
Lawrence

1270
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,750
and it keeps on doing it the whole
entire night to the bird call.

1271
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,950
So I'm thinking about like poisoning or
slingshotting are shooting this bird.

1272
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:53,050
I don't know what to do
because it's been all night.

1273
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,190
You're Greek day this week.

1274
00:30:54,191 --> 00:30:57,900
You know how long you'd be
out there trying to slingshot
this break every window

1275
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,060
and I bet you got some people
listen to the podcast too.

1276
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,880
Like I know what that mother fucker lives.

1277
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:04,870
It was him with that sling shot.

1278
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,733
Yeah.

1279
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,870
It's a horrible though.

1280
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,600
I need to BB guns.

1281
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,590
Bb guns are pretty accurate.

1282
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:08,861
Yeah,

1283
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:09,311
I was thinking about,

1284
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:10,121
I can't even see it.

1285
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:10,954
It's just this big.

1286
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,890
That's what I'm saying.

1287
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,080
That's just one of those
ideas you get in your head.

1288
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:14,410
You're like,

1289
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:14,860
I'm going to,

1290
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,700
I'm going to put an end to this.

1291
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:16,680
And then you ended up being like,

1292
00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:18,730
like Wiley Coyote or like Elmer Fudd.

1293
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,890
That's how people like fall from trees
and break their neck and die trying to

1294
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:26,170
kill some bird tweets outside your window.

1295
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:26,400
Yeah,

1296
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:26,570
I've,

1297
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,640
I've had times when like,

1298
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,380
I don't know if you guys
had like the mosquito,

1299
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:32,200
the mosquitoes are worse than your
sleeping and then he like ignore it,

1300
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,651
ignore it.

1301
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:33,490
He keeps coming back like,

1302
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:33,821
fuck it.

1303
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:34,840
It's on lights.

1304
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:38,740
Go on now you got to go around looking
for the mosquito against your white wall.

1305
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,670
Like he disappears.

1306
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:40,391
He reappears,

1307
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:41,410
you're swinging shit.

1308
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:41,621
Yeah.

1309
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:44,610
Your eyes are trying to focus
my God fucking tears in them,

1310
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,440
you know,

1311
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,141
half hour later like,

1312
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:47,974
fuck it man.

1313
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:53,560
We don't realize how few bugs we have
in California until you go on the east

1314
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:58,330
coast in the summertime and you
realize like go near a lake lake in the

1315
00:31:58,331 --> 00:31:58,811
summertime,

1316
00:31:58,811 --> 00:31:59,021
you're like,

1317
00:31:59,021 --> 00:31:59,831
mother fucker.

1318
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:00,910
This is ridiculous.

1319
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:01,450
Yeah.

1320
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,920
But you know how cool lightning bugs was.

1321
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,690
I do miss lightening bugs when you're
just going out in your backyard and just

1322
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,240
like this glowing paradise.

1323
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:08,441
But those are cool.

1324
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:08,711
They don't,

1325
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:09,790
but they don't bother you.

1326
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:10,210
You know,

1327
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,050
like smell grips,

1328
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,630
I would say with,

1329
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,461
with mosquitoes,

1330
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:14,170
like they never have mosquitoes.

1331
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,670
Mosquitoes,

1332
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:17,020
not a fuckup paradise.

1333
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,370
Whenever you book a trip,

1334
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,660
you go down to Mexico and you're like,

1335
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,110
oh,

1336
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,771
this is great.

1337
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:21,521
Here's the beer,

1338
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:22,300
here's the Tequila,

1339
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,990
whatever.

1340
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,350
And like half an hour later
you start getting busy like,

1341
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,710
and every time they showed those stupid
corona commercials where the guy like

1342
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:31,720
throws his cell phone under the water,

1343
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,231
I'm like,

1344
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:33,770
show the fucking mosquitoes man.

1345
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,380
It never that comfortable.

1346
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,570
That's one of the good
things about Hawaii too.

1347
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,240
Not Too many bugs in Hawaii that's make
that trip out to that volcano in the

1348
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:42,040
middle of the ocean.

1349
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,410
Yeah,

1350
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:42,711
yeah,

1351
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:42,861
yeah.

1352
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:43,580
That's not a bad,

1353
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,330
yeah.

1354
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,500
Not that many bugs man.

1355
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,750
But California as far as like no bugs,

1356
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:49,580
this is probably as good as it
gets anywhere in the country.

1357
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,781
You've got to Florida,

1358
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:51,800
Florida is ridiculous.

1359
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,690
I might as well be living in the jungle.

1360
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,593
Yeah.

1361
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,970
Cause there was an apartment building.

1362
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:57,050
Doesn't mean it's not the jungle.

1363
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,630
You've got a little pond next door
with a fucking alligator in it.

1364
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:00,270
What's that?

1365
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,670
They could be living in Gainesville.

1366
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,630
You could be living in like a nice
part of town and take a couple blocks,

1367
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:06,800
go for a walk and Oh,

1368
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,221
what's this?

1369
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:08,054
A dinosaur.

1370
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,530
It's a fucking dinosaur poodle eating
dinosaur wander to the streets.

1371
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,610
The Komodo dragons and monsters and
alligators are not that aggressive.

1372
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:18,230
They're not nearly as
aggressive as crocodiles.

1373
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,860
Crocodiles are really dangerous.

1374
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:20,180
It's different.

1375
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,470
It's an alligator and a crocodile.

1376
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,580
The looks are different.

1377
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:23,301
A crocodile,

1378
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,390
their teeth like stick out of their
mouth a little bit and they have a longer

1379
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:27,140
snout.

1380
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,930
Alligators have like a
shorter stubbier wider snout,

1381
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,251
but there.

1382
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:32,510
But alligators in general
are bigger than crocodiles,

1383
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:32,780
right?

1384
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,830
No crocodiles,

1385
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,910
they can get bigger.

1386
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,570
I think maybe American alligators might
be bigger than American crocodiles,

1387
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,583
but the biggest,

1388
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,630
the biggest crocodiles
are the biggest of that.

1389
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,493
That you know,

1390
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,290
species that form similar though.

1391
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:45,921
I mean Shit,

1392
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,820
if you didn't know and you saw
an alligator and a crocodile,

1393
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,510
you would say that's the same thing
like a Mexican and Guatemalan.

1394
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,081
Exactly.

1395
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:52,760
Yeah.

1396
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,001
Yeah.

1397
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:54,110
They don't look much different,

1398
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:54,320
man,

1399
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,200
but apparently they're,

1400
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,420
they're way more aggressive.

1401
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:57,260
Crocodiles are much,

1402
00:33:57,261 --> 00:33:58,190
much more aggressive.

1403
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,670
Yeah.

1404
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:03,080
I watched some documentary on alligators
and crocodiles and they had this place

1405
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:03,280
in,

1406
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,710
uh,

1407
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,560
I believe it was in Florida where they
were raising them and they had all these

1408
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:07,390
crocodiles,

1409
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:07,700
this,

1410
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,870
these alligators and one crocodile and
the crocodile would run over the top of

1411
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:13,640
the alligators head when they would feed,

1412
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,080
he would like be bitch,

1413
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:17,390
just stepping over them
to get to the food.

1414
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,240
Just super way more aggressive
than the alligators.

1415
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:20,841
But in general,

1416
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:21,210
you're right.

1417
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:21,550
Like,

1418
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,890
like I don't know how people like,

1419
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,630
I mean,

1420
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,670
once in a while we got like
mountain lions and stuff,

1421
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,290
but generally speaking at,

1422
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:27,890
you know,

1423
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,680
how much you know with that suck if he's
just hanging out in a crocodile or an

1424
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:32,090
alligator shows up in your backyard.

1425
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,983
Now what he'd do,

1426
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:33,621
well,

1427
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:37,250
there was a funny story in Miami about
a guy who was running from the law and a

1428
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:39,260
in a high speed chase ditches,

1429
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:40,610
his car wipes his car out,

1430
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:45,080
jumps into a fucking river and
wherever he was or jumped into a lake,

1431
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,550
the moment he jumped in,

1432
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:47,900
he got killed by an alligator.

1433
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:48,530
Oh my God.

1434
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:52,550
He just landed like right
next to an alligator and the
alligator jack them right

1435
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:53,870
in front of the car on my God.

1436
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,281
I mean,

1437
00:34:54,281 --> 00:34:55,970
it's a fucking movie that is hilarious.

1438
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:56,690
Fucking movie.

1439
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,490
The guy jumps out of the car,

1440
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,710
dives into the water and right away,

1441
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,101
boom.

1442
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:01,934
Gets killed.

1443
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,433
Yeah,

1444
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,861
it happens.

1445
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:05,900
Those cops are good man.

1446
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,340
They got alligators working with them.

1447
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,211
That's like,

1448
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:08,781
I was actually,

1449
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:09,620
I read when I,

1450
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,720
it just meant I said the key.

1451
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,200
Is it Kimono Komodo Dragon,

1452
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:12,440
right?

1453
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,273
Yeah.

1454
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,450
Some guy read in the paper,

1455
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:17,540
this guy was like on a boat or something
or he was surfing or something happen.

1456
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,760
I think it was on a boat
and the shipwrecked.

1457
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,050
So this poor guy swims to the
first piece of land he finds,

1458
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:26,990
he swims to the shore and a
Komodo dragon confronts him.

1459
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:27,321
I was like,

1460
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:28,160
this poor guy.

1461
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,151
Can you imagine?

1462
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:29,301
Like,

1463
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:30,111
it's like a video game.

1464
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,410
It's like you survived the thing and I,

1465
00:35:32,411 --> 00:35:32,811
you still have,

1466
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:33,080
you're like,

1467
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,740
oh great,

1468
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,700
now I kill him.

1469
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:35,301
What's next?

1470
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:36,100
You know?

1471
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,650
You know,

1472
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,410
did he,

1473
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,160
I think he'd live

1474
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,821
Holy Shit.

1475
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:39,510
Yeah.

1476
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,110
There was a guy who was a dating Sharon
Stone of Sharon Stone's boyfriend.

1477
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,890
Oh yeah,

1478
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:44,400
yeah.

1479
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,070
He was something like Moot newspaper
guy or something like that.

1480
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:47,420
Yeah.

1481
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,090
Apparently he was in a whole room
full of Komodo dragons at like a zoo.

1482
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,160
We had white socks on and
the Komodo dragon mistook
his white foot for a rabbit,

1483
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,890
so it just snapped down on his foot.

1484
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:03,300
That guy's fucking screaming and the
poison that they have in their saliva,

1485
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:07,050
they have botulism and all sorts of
horrible bacteria in their saliva,

1486
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,480
and you get deathly ill from those bites,

1487
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:13,550
like you have to go on some
radical antibiotics like
immediately or you're going

1488
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:14,384
to die.

1489
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,630
That's how it kills things.

1490
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,720
The Komodo dragons bite things
and then just follow them.

1491
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,660
Just infect them with
their saliva like they,

1492
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:25,140
there's a video of one that kills a water
buffalo and it bites us water buffalo,

1493
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,590
just Jackson and a leg and the water
buffalo runs away and then it slowly

1494
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:32,490
follows it for a day while it poisons
itself slowly gets poisoned from that

1495
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:33,210
bite.

1496
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,770
It's fucking crazy lists that the,

1497
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,620
those guide die or he lived,

1498
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,860
he lived because they were right there
and they got the thing off of them.

1499
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:41,910
They got it off his foot,

1500
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,601
but you know,

1501
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:43,680
he almost lost his foot.

1502
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,461
That is crazy.

1503
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:45,370
That stuff is there.

1504
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,950
There is so dangerous to fucking,

1505
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,350
they played by a whole
different set of rules.

1506
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:50,184
So yeah,

1507
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,320
65 million years ago,

1508
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:53,700
these motherfuckers were roaming around.

1509
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,323
Yeah.

1510
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,100
Yeah.

1511
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,671
That's crazy.

1512
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:57,241
And animals.

1513
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:58,320
And generally I was thinking about that.

1514
00:36:58,321 --> 00:36:59,870
That lady has seaworld that got that.

1515
00:36:59,871 --> 00:37:01,220
The whale that just took,

1516
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:01,741
took her.

1517
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:02,000
I mean,

1518
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,580
can,

1519
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,480
can you imagine?

1520
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:03,691
I mean,

1521
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:04,111
I can't,

1522
00:37:04,111 --> 00:37:04,944
I mean,

1523
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,640
Ooh,

1524
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,450
it's terrifying.

1525
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:06,870
Yeah.

1526
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,130
You can't talk your way out of it.

1527
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:08,880
Terrifying.

1528
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,820
And the really terrifying thing about
the killer whale thing is that we know

1529
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:12,810
that they're smart.

1530
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,070
We know that they're intelligent,

1531
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,390
they're not as smart as us,

1532
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:16,920
but they're pretty God damn close.

1533
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,420
They can't change their
environment like us.

1534
00:37:18,421 --> 00:37:19,350
And we show,

1535
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,040
there's no evidence of them being able
to create things and build items like we

1536
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:23,670
can.

1537
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,080
But we know they have dialects.

1538
00:37:25,081 --> 00:37:28,680
We know that there are superintelligent
as far as their language and it varies

1539
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,190
from sector to sector and we also know
that they're like incredibly attached to

1540
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:36,390
their family and they have like this
really broad language that we don't even

1541
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:37,224
totally understand.

1542
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,850
So we know that there are these super
intense intelligent animals and we still

1543
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:43,110
lock 'em up in swimming pools.

1544
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,670
You know we just go,

1545
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:45,331
fuck you.

1546
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:46,380
I don't understand what you're saying.

1547
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,000
What he's saying get in there.

1548
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,740
Like if that thing was saying,

1549
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,270
please I want to be with my mother,

1550
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:52,230
please let me go.

1551
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,170
You know,

1552
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,920
if it could actually talk and
tell you what they really feel,

1553
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,140
they would be screaming
in agony every night they,

1554
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,420
they stuffed them into
these little tiny tanks.

1555
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,980
It's like a refugee camp or something.

1556
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,903
Yeah,

1557
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,080
they make them perform.

1558
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,310
One of the ways they make the performance,

1559
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:08,830
stuffing them into these little tanks
at night to punish them and then now the

1560
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:10,140
learn to jump so you can edit me.

1561
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,981
People will clap for you.

1562
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:12,030
You didn't want people to clap for you.

1563
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:12,691
That's the swale.

1564
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:15,150
It killed at least two
people to that is crazy.

1565
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,500
He's killed at least two.

1566
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,360
He's a bad motherfucker.

1567
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:19,980
He doesn't want to deal
with their bullshit man.

1568
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,630
You know he's right.

1569
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:22,464
I see his point.

1570
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:23,791
Fuck man.

1571
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:26,970
If aliens came and they were smarter
than us and they just couldn't understand

1572
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:27,360
us,

1573
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,350
and we're talking to them like,

1574
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:28,711
please,

1575
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:29,570
we'll get our shit together.

1576
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,750
We'll stop polluting the ocean.

1577
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:32,730
Please don't fucking eat us.

1578
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,320
And then they just started eating people.

1579
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:34,561
They're like,

1580
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:35,800
I don't understand you bitch.

1581
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,100
So

1582
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,490
yeah,

1583
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,420
she's gonna throw you in the zoo.

1584
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,283
The people's zoo.

1585
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,780
And this guy's like the
revolutionary of Wales.

1586
00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:41,021
He's like,

1587
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:43,510
the Che Guevara is busting out.

1588
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:44,820
Yes.

1589
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,101
I mean,

1590
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:45,311
look,

1591
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:49,450
I'm on team people 100% but we
should have totally rethink seaworld.

1592
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,940
We should totally rethink anything where
super intelligent animals like that are

1593
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,620
entrapped.

1594
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,280
Yeah.

1595
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,113
Feed them fish.

1596
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,931
They're depressed.

1597
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:56,764
They have to be.

1598
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,400
There's no way it could be a
happy fucking in prison dolphin.

1599
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:00,671
I mean,

1600
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,140
it's pretty entertaining for your kids.

1601
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:02,500
But,

1602
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,430
but beyond that,

1603
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:04,570
like I took my kid to the,

1604
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:04,810
uh,

1605
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,500
to the aquarium at Mandalay
Bay and he was two,

1606
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:09,101
two and a half of that.

1607
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:09,934
He was going,

1608
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,990
he would see the shark.

1609
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:11,990
He was shock.

1610
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:12,700
Shock.

1611
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,980
It would take my head I was holding,

1612
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,050
he'd take my head and just twist
it to wherever the shark was.

1613
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:17,740
I was like,

1614
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,160
they should,

1615
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,930
they should hire him out
at the front and be like,

1616
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:21,010
you want a tour from this guy?

1617
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,950
And he's just takes your
head shot a commercial.

1618
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:24,401
Oh yeah.

1619
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:25,330
That'd be a great commercial.

1620
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:25,690
Right.

1621
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,890
That would be a great commercial.

1622
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,760
But that's different though.

1623
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:28,510
That's fish.

1624
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:28,751
Yeah,

1625
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:29,281
that's true.

1626
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:30,190
I go fuck themselves.

1627
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:30,340
Right.

1628
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,173
They're stupid.

1629
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,470
They don't even take care of their,

1630
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,304
they're young.

1631
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,520
They just jerk off on eggs
and the eggs become babies.

1632
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:37,510
I don't care about fish,

1633
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,621
but dolphins,

1634
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:39,670
I know that they can think,

1635
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,410
oh yeah.

1636
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:40,590
Oh,

1637
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,690
you watched the cove you ever see?

1638
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,551
Did you see the cove?

1639
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:42,701
No,

1640
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:44,050
I didn't see the co terrifying.

1641
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,150
And you see the slaughter of Japanese,

1642
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,011
the Japanese slaughter,

1643
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:48,130
those stall fisherman.

1644
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,570
So hard to watch,

1645
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:49,900
man,

1646
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,920
cause you know they're smart.

1647
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,600
Dolphins are smart as fuck.

1648
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,590
They're like little weird,

1649
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:54,670
intelligent aliens.

1650
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:56,470
Almost like little water elves.

1651
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,180
Like they're playful little water ELLs.

1652
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,880
They're super smart and they seem benign.

1653
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:01,061
I mean,

1654
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:01,570
I don't know.

1655
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,890
I'm sure they have both sides,

1656
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:04,510
but they seem very Dell rape view.

1657
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,231
They'll rape you,

1658
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:05,740
but you know,

1659
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,060
they'll throw a rape it on your ass.

1660
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,770
I'll try it out one.

1661
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:09,610
Can you imagine that?

1662
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,140
How do you come back and report a video
online of a woman getting humped on a

1663
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:14,974
dock?

1664
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,640
But Dolphins,

1665
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,430
gadget guy.

1666
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,151
He's a guy.

1667
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:18,130
It's a gay dolphin.

1668
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:19,680
Gay Rapist.

1669
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,513
Dolphin.

1670
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,783
That's great.

1671
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:22,930
Yeah.

1672
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:23,591
I don't know man.

1673
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:26,740
I think eventually we're going to have
to come to conclusion that zoos are

1674
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:29,470
really cruel and inhumane punishment.

1675
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,270
And there those are animal prisons.

1676
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,481
Oh,

1677
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:31,931
you've been to,

1678
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:34,200
you've been to the La Zoo man zone.

1679
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,200
It's just miserable.

1680
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:35,740
Horrible.

1681
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,630
It's the worst even open.

1682
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:38,640
So it's walkable,

1683
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,540
old ghosts parts.

1684
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:41,291
Hey Bravo.

1685
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,810
Fucked up and went to
the zoo on mushrooms.

1686
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,763
Oh,

1687
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,400
awful.

1688
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,780
He said it was so sad.

1689
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,940
He said it was like the saddest day ever.

1690
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,691
I said all you could do,

1691
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:51,310
you feel all the negative,

1692
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:53,100
sad energy from these poor animals.

1693
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,050
People staring at them and
the animals are usually,

1694
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:56,831
it's,

1695
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:59,830
they seem like every little display went
to like the animal was just looking for

1696
00:40:59,831 --> 00:41:00,370
shade.

1697
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:00,940
Yeah.

1698
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,380
He didn't want to entertain you.

1699
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,440
He just in the corner somewhere looking
for shade and then they had like an

1700
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:06,660
elephant thing and it was,

1701
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,280
and it was in the back and they had like,

1702
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,133
it didn't even make it.

1703
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:09,911
The guy was like,

1704
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:10,690
it's a long,

1705
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,523
long walk.

1706
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,090
So poorly thought out too,

1707
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:13,924
because look,

1708
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,980
human beings have a bunch of systems
that are put in place to ensure that we

1709
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:20,140
breed to ensure that we succeed in life,

1710
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:22,030
to ensure that we accomplish things.

1711
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:24,220
There's all these things that are
set up in order for us to live.

1712
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:24,701
You know,

1713
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:25,600
the human way.

1714
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:25,871
Well,

1715
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:26,790
for animals there,

1716
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,290
there's all these instincts
set up in their minds too.

1717
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,180
One of the big ones is to kill things,

1718
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,141
to kill things,

1719
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:32,980
to survive.

1720
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,381
You know,

1721
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:33,621
they,

1722
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:34,220
they get

1723
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,300
that charge that,

1724
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:35,481
I mean,

1725
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:36,980
that's what it's fun for them.

1726
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,990
That is what is the joy of life.

1727
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,850
I mean it seems cruel and fucked up,

1728
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:44,450
but the joy of life or aligns to take
out a gazelle and that's what it is.

1729
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:45,600
That's what it therefore,

1730
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,970
so if you're going to have real animals
and you're going to have them in these

1731
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,720
locked down environments and pretend
that it's good for them and pretend that

1732
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:54,554
it's a good environment,

1733
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,670
you got to let them kill things,

1734
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:56,290
man.

1735
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,123
Yeah.

1736
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,871
It's like,

1737
00:41:57,871 --> 00:41:58,230
um,

1738
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:01,260
I went to Kenya once and they
have like the animal preserve,

1739
00:42:01,261 --> 00:42:03,630
so you just go in and they
say you actually kind of,

1740
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,660
it's almost like you're going into
their turf now to check it out.

1741
00:42:06,661 --> 00:42:07,111
So it's not,

1742
00:42:07,111 --> 00:42:07,944
they're not caged,

1743
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,270
but it's actually really interesting.

1744
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:10,170
So you go somewhere in there.

1745
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:11,790
They are just doing their natural thing.

1746
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:13,020
It was a lot more natural,

1747
00:42:13,021 --> 00:42:13,710
it seemed.

1748
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,980
The one thing was we were driving back
and we saw a rhino and we were in this

1749
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:17,491
little like,

1750
00:42:17,491 --> 00:42:19,480
they give us this like
minivan and I don't mean to,

1751
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:19,621
but yeah,

1752
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:19,801
it was,

1753
00:42:19,801 --> 00:42:20,230
it was a,

1754
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,063
it was a,

1755
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,430
it was this little van and
we had like this driver,

1756
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,990
this Kenyan driver,

1757
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,970
and he wasn't at all like,

1758
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:27,691
you know,

1759
00:42:27,691 --> 00:42:28,830
he wasn't armed.

1760
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,300
He didn't seem like he was,

1761
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,620
he was there to protect us.

1762
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,071
He looked like,

1763
00:42:32,071 --> 00:42:32,650
remember the guy,

1764
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,660
the gods must be crazy.

1765
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:34,494
I remember like the skinny,

1766
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,860
it seemed like that's the guy that was
driving and there was like no defense

1767
00:42:37,861 --> 00:42:38,694
mechanism.

1768
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,540
I'm like,

1769
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,780
so this guy stops and where
there's like eight or nine of us,

1770
00:42:42,781 --> 00:42:42,931
you know,

1771
00:42:42,931 --> 00:42:46,470
all Westerners and this rhino
is like eating and we're like,

1772
00:42:46,471 --> 00:42:46,741
look,

1773
00:42:46,741 --> 00:42:47,431
Rhino Rhino.

1774
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:51,540
And he looks up and he gives
us this like look of death.

1775
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,630
Like it's almost like you just interrupt
this shook night in the middle of some

1776
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,750
business meeting and,

1777
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:57,271
and we all,

1778
00:42:57,271 --> 00:42:58,350
we all freaked out.

1779
00:42:58,351 --> 00:42:59,460
Like it was an intimidating look.

1780
00:42:59,461 --> 00:42:59,761
We're like,

1781
00:42:59,761 --> 00:43:00,061
go,

1782
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:00,331
go,

1783
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:00,601
go.

1784
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:01,434
And the guy's like,

1785
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:01,851
like,

1786
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:02,151
like,

1787
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:03,060
like Fred Flintstone.

1788
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:04,060
He like get the car going.

1789
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:04,760
Yeah,

1790
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,580
exactly.

1791
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,200
And our Fresno telling
us what these guys do,

1792
00:43:07,201 --> 00:43:09,060
I guess are colorblind
the rhinos and they,

1793
00:43:09,061 --> 00:43:10,410
and they just see something.

1794
00:43:10,411 --> 00:43:10,960
And if it,

1795
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,210
if it's disturbing them,

1796
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:12,961
they just run,

1797
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:13,591
they would ramp,

1798
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:13,921
they would've,

1799
00:43:13,921 --> 00:43:16,680
he would've rammed us
and they'll tip you over.

1800
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,701
And now it's,

1801
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:18,031
you know,

1802
00:43:18,031 --> 00:43:18,571
whatever,

1803
00:43:18,571 --> 00:43:19,440
however it plays out,

1804
00:43:19,441 --> 00:43:20,040
it plays out.

1805
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,873
Either we all,

1806
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:21,890
you know,

1807
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,300
you all get stomped to death.

1808
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:23,990
Some shit.

1809
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,780
So pretty crazy dude.

1810
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:32,050
Dead Rhinos in hippos are two of my
number one fears as far as animals go.

1811
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:32,691
Hungry,

1812
00:43:32,691 --> 00:43:33,500
hippos,

1813
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:33,861
hungry,

1814
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,191
hungry,

1815
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:34,431
hungry,

1816
00:43:34,431 --> 00:43:34,701
hungry,

1817
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:35,450
hippos,

1818
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:35,841
hippos.

1819
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:39,170
I think you're responsible for more human
deaths in any other animal in Africa

1820
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,820
other than ants.

1821
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,060
Really believe aunts are responsible for
more human death in any item on answer

1822
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:45,740
kill people.

1823
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,251
Oh Shit,

1824
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:46,780
dude.

1825
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,930
[inaudible] in Africa,

1826
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:49,390
they've got real problems with uh,

1827
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:52,580
with giant swarms of poisonous ants.

1828
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,443
Oh Shit.

1829
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,400
Army ants and all these different,

1830
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:55,671
there's,

1831
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:55,881
there's,

1832
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:57,830
there's so many really vicious aunts.

1833
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,780
Especially like in the Amazon,

1834
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:02,510
there's a thing called the bullet ants.

1835
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:03,051
And,

1836
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:03,240
uh,

1837
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:03,660
they,

1838
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,850
they actually use them for coming of age
ceremonies where they make these young

1839
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:11,480
men stick their hand in these gloves
that are filled with these bullet ants.

1840
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,050
Oh my God.

1841
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:12,883
And he's bullet ants.

1842
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,660
It's unbearable pain for
like 24 hours for each bite.

1843
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,030
Oh,

1844
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,290
like unbearable.

1845
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,290
Like getting your hands slammed
in a car door all day long.

1846
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,153
That is crazy.

1847
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,710
Like insane pain and that's
like the coming of age thing.

1848
00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:24,920
Instead,

1849
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,060
if a man can get through this,

1850
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:28,640
he can truly be a match
to get benefit vendor.

1851
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:29,720
But in Africa,

1852
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,410
Brian Callan actually,

1853
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:31,770
um,

1854
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,430
was uh,

1855
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,580
working when,

1856
00:44:33,581 --> 00:44:37,350
when he first got out of college he wanted
to work with insects and he wanted to

1857
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:38,820
study them and overseas.

1858
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,500
And one of the things
that scared him off his,

1859
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:40,981
cause he went,

1860
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:44,940
I think to Bornea he went to some crazy
fucking jungle and they had to put

1861
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:45,631
Turpentine,

1862
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:49,330
they all slept on platforms and they
had to put Turpentine all over the,

1863
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,900
the legs of the platform.

1864
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:56,170
And they have to be elevated above the
floor of the jungle because if you're

1865
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:56,700
leave,

1866
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,490
if you leave them on the floor of
the jungle and the ants come up,

1867
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,670
once one ant bites you and sends a signal,

1868
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:03,180
they'll,

1869
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,030
there will be millions of ants on you,

1870
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:08,490
poisonous ants on you and
you won't be able to stop it.

1871
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:09,660
There's nothing you can do.

1872
00:45:09,661 --> 00:45:11,080
They will eat you alive fishing.

1873
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,900
They take out elephants,

1874
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,020
they climb up elephant's legs and they
climb in their ears and start eating

1875
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:17,190
them.

1876
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,023
I'm alive.

1877
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:19,510
The more I hear things like this,

1878
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:22,630
the more I realized like I just
want to go to four seasons.

1879
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,260
I the world thing in burden
is be like the waffles day.

1880
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,360
It's all good man.

1881
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:30,520
I know some people are like adventures.

1882
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,560
I we're going to go into
the jungle and did it on my,

1883
00:45:32,561 --> 00:45:33,640
you go camping bro.

1884
00:45:33,641 --> 00:45:34,900
I'll be at the four seasons.

1885
00:45:34,901 --> 00:45:35,734
You know

1886
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,200
Brian said that date.

1887
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:41,190
So they poured Turpentine all over
the legs of this platform that the,

1888
00:45:41,191 --> 00:45:41,431
they're,

1889
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:42,330
they're sleeping on,

1890
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:42,620
you know,

1891
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,550
they have the hut and the
Hud is above the platform.

1892
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:45,840
And he said in the night,

1893
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,640
you can hear them marching.

1894
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:48,451
He said,

1895
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:49,650
there's so many ants in there,

1896
00:45:49,651 --> 00:45:51,750
so terrifying that you
can hear them marching.

1897
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:52,584
You hear that?

1898
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,590
That is creepy.

1899
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:59,400
You hear millions and millions of answers
waiting to stumble on something and

1900
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:00,390
whatever they stumble on,

1901
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,111
whether it's a,

1902
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:01,351
you know,

1903
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:01,561
they'll,

1904
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:03,090
they'll climb up a tree and find some,

1905
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:03,330
uh,

1906
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,900
some of the young birds that are
stuck in the Nast and smores,

1907
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,101
millions of them.

1908
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:09,960
So like there's a lot of jungles.

1909
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:10,210
The,

1910
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:14,670
the birds will try to put their nests
on the highest possible branch and a lot

1911
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,960
of it is to avoid ants.

1912
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:17,290
That is ridiculous.

1913
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:18,150
Answer mother fucker.

1914
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:18,700
That's like,

1915
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,170
you know,

1916
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,760
it's funny cause like when uh,

1917
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:21,520
you know,

1918
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,590
when you travel you realize
what you were saying.

1919
00:46:23,591 --> 00:46:25,040
Like it's like the,

1920
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:25,330
the,

1921
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,850
like the amount of stuff that's going,

1922
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:27,371
like the,

1923
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:29,320
the difficulty to live
in some other places.

1924
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,390
Like when I went to Kenya,

1925
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:32,710
we were for a wedding just just to get it,

1926
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,090
just to go to Kenya.

1927
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,081
You gotta go,

1928
00:46:35,081 --> 00:46:38,290
you gotta get like shots for dengue fever,

1929
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:39,550
yellow fever,

1930
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,860
jungle fever and all kinds of fever area.

1931
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:42,161
Yeah,

1932
00:46:42,161 --> 00:46:43,030
I'll kind of malaria.

1933
00:46:43,031 --> 00:46:44,410
I was like it w what the fuck?

1934
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,273
Where are we going?

1935
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,413
Got To know.

1936
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,600
I have yet to the motherland,

1937
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:49,900
the order,

1938
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:50,490
the motherland.

1939
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:51,670
If we get some jungle feel

1940
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:53,720
that

1941
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,950
is the motherland too.

1942
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:55,761
That's,

1943
00:46:55,761 --> 00:46:56,990
that's where it all began.

1944
00:46:56,991 --> 00:46:59,120
That's where human beings were hatched.

1945
00:46:59,180 --> 00:46:59,990
Yeah.

1946
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:00,741
That's pretty crazy.

1947
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:02,570
That now still so fucking wild.

1948
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:03,081
It's crazy,

1949
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:03,351
right?

1950
00:47:03,351 --> 00:47:04,280
When you look at Africa,

1951
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:04,941
the continent,

1952
00:47:04,941 --> 00:47:07,910
like you ever watch like
those documentaries on
African and compare it to any

1953
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:09,350
other constant continent in the world.

1954
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:09,741
You're like,

1955
00:47:09,741 --> 00:47:10,910
what the fuck man?

1956
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,220
You got willed the BC
lions and crocodiles,

1957
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:19,350
saltwater crocodiles and fucking great
white sharks off the coast of South

1958
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,830
Africa and it's Jesus Christ.

1959
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,050
No continent is crazier than Africa.

1960
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:28,070
I guess Australia is probably a close
and don't even get started on the flies

1961
00:47:28,071 --> 00:47:29,060
and how annoying that would be.

1962
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,970
Your eyes just sitting on
your face all the time.

1963
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,653
I was in Africa.

1964
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:33,131
Yeah.

1965
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:34,750
Whenever you see those poor starving kids,

1966
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,490
it's one of the saddest
things about those videos.

1967
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,460
The eyes they have covered
with flies and shit.

1968
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:40,180
Fucked up.

1969
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,250
What a fucking crazy place on earth.

1970
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,230
I am obsessed with the Congo man.

1971
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:46,720
I've got a bunch of
documentaries on the Congo.

1972
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:48,490
One of the best ones is from the BBC.

1973
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,360
But uh,

1974
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,420
one of the most fascinating things about
the Congo is there's so many areas of

1975
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:54,150
it they'd like people barely get to.

1976
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:54,700
Yeah.

1977
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,533
There's like this,

1978
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,000
it's unbelievable how fucking dense it is.

1979
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:58,571
And they,

1980
00:47:58,571 --> 00:47:59,530
in one point in time,

1981
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:00,850
Europeans tried to settle it.

1982
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,130
They tried to like build
these giant mansions and shit.

1983
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,270
And some of them are still there,

1984
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:05,170
like in frame,

1985
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,480
but that just gets
swallowed up by the jungle.

1986
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,560
It's just too wild.

1987
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,171
It was crazy.

1988
00:48:09,171 --> 00:48:09,531
As you got,

1989
00:48:09,531 --> 00:48:09,940
you got,

1990
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,710
you get nature and then you've
got like rebels fighting each.

1991
00:48:12,711 --> 00:48:12,981
I mean,

1992
00:48:12,981 --> 00:48:14,670
so you might survive the ants.

1993
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,780
Are you going to be taken down
by the whatever the cognitive is,

1994
00:48:17,781 --> 00:48:18,051
rebel,

1995
00:48:18,051 --> 00:48:18,441
whoever,

1996
00:48:18,441 --> 00:48:19,010
you know?

1997
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:19,251
Yeah.

1998
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:21,650
There's a lot of problems because
they're fighting over resources.

1999
00:48:21,651 --> 00:48:24,350
There's a lot of minerals in the Congo
is a lot of minerals that they used to

2000
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:25,790
make cell phones and shit like that.

2001
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,451
It's a lot of,

2002
00:48:26,451 --> 00:48:27,780
that is where they harvested.

2003
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:27,910
Okay.

2004
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,330
Have you ever performed a South Africa?

2005
00:48:29,331 --> 00:48:30,164
You ever go?

2006
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:30,651
You haven't?

2007
00:48:30,651 --> 00:48:31,390
Huh?

2008
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:32,810
The two festivals I want to go.

2009
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:33,690
No.

2010
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:33,790
No.

2011
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:35,600
It's supposed to be pretty cool.

2012
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:36,434
Sure it is.

2013
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,050
I'm tired of traveling,

2014
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:38,351
man.

2015
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:40,510
I enjoy going to the UK like once a year,

2016
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:41,141
but even that,

2017
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:41,891
it's like enough.

2018
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:42,790
I go to Australia once.

2019
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:43,624
He,

2020
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:44,311
no,

2021
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:45,620
I hear you too much sick.

2022
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,591
I'm sick of the trap.

2023
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:46,801
I mean,

2024
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:47,521
I'd be curious to see it,

2025
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:48,060
but I mean,

2026
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,630
it's funny because people ask like the
fun part of stand up is actually being on

2027
00:48:51,631 --> 00:48:55,500
stage and doing a show and I'd
rather just drive up the block,

2028
00:48:55,501 --> 00:48:55,831
the sun,

2029
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:59,520
so to Bray go and just get on a plane.

2030
00:48:59,530 --> 00:48:59,840
Well,

2031
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,410
we're in a great

2032
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:02,780
by two because we can work
so many places around here.

2033
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:04,880
You can go to a comedy
magic club in Hermosa Beach.

2034
00:49:04,881 --> 00:49:05,840
You go to the ice house,

2035
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:07,100
you can go to San Diego,

2036
00:49:07,101 --> 00:49:07,701
you can go to,

2037
00:49:07,701 --> 00:49:08,160
you know,

2038
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,110
you can go to Irvine,

2039
00:49:09,111 --> 00:49:10,940
you get a Bray and you can go to Ontario,

2040
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:11,901
you can do all the Improv.

2041
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:12,620
So you could do,

2042
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,070
I mean,

2043
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:16,280
and you rotate all these clubs and after
awhile you just start back up on the

2044
00:49:16,281 --> 00:49:16,911
first one again.

2045
00:49:16,911 --> 00:49:17,121
You know,

2046
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,620
it's like 1520 weeks later.

2047
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:19,100
Yeah.

2048
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,710
And then just doing these same
clubs over and over again.

2049
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:23,820
Performing side of fs,

2050
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,693
South African,

2051
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,850
you just clam claim,

2052
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:29,723
you can't,

2053
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:30,883
I can't help you.

2054
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:33,800
South Africa is a,

2055
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:34,910
I'm sure it's a great place.

2056
00:49:34,911 --> 00:49:35,780
I like DMT were,

2057
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:36,890
yeah,

2058
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,150
okay.

2059
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:37,983
They got good music.

2060
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:39,490
I mean,

2061
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:39,730
you know,

2062
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,710
actually I was district nine too.

2063
00:49:41,711 --> 00:49:42,700
I was thinking of going,

2064
00:49:42,701 --> 00:49:43,534
I mean I,

2065
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:47,020
there was like an offer to go this summer
and I was thinking as I always say,

2066
00:49:47,021 --> 00:49:49,430
cause I've got two young
kids now and my wife's,

2067
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:49,691
I was like,

2068
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:51,400
well maybe I'll just
take everybody with me.

2069
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:52,331
And I was like,

2070
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:54,980
well that made me think
the nanny to to Africa.

2071
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:55,750
I do it.

2072
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,650
I started doing the math.

2073
00:49:56,651 --> 00:49:57,250
I'm like,

2074
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,150
I would be like losing a lot of money.

2075
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,400
Just like screw it,

2076
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,593
we're going to stay here.

2077
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,530
Chevy Chase.

2078
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,363
Yeah,

2079
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,590
you must have a big international
following now because you,

2080
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,690
you've really become like as far as like
would you call it the Persian community

2081
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:12,130
or the area

2082
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:12,963
learning community.

2083
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,860
But you know the Persian committee is
like my first probably it's funny like a

2084
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,330
like triple e one time Santa Trivia.

2085
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:18,721
It was like,

2086
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:19,081
he's like,

2087
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:20,160
you're like the Persian Elvis,

2088
00:50:20,161 --> 00:50:21,390
otherwise known as pelvis.

2089
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,940
So that sounds like a triple e line.

2090
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:24,211
Right.

2091
00:50:24,211 --> 00:50:25,020
So so I,

2092
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:25,730
so that,

2093
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,520
that's like my,

2094
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,300
like you got,

2095
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,760
you got the Persian middle easterners,

2096
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:30,110
then you got like Arabs,

2097
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:30,861
you know,

2098
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:31,251
and then,

2099
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:35,330
and then after that like then like you've
got like NPR types that are into like

2100
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,223
world.

2101
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:39,210
That's hilarious.

2102
00:50:39,211 --> 00:50:39,361
Yeah.

2103
00:50:39,361 --> 00:50:39,961
I'm telling you man,

2104
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:41,530
I love the fact that you're different.

2105
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,290
It's actually pretty funny though.

2106
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:43,730
It's,

2107
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,160
well it's actually good to like do stand
up in front of people that know the

2108
00:50:47,161 --> 00:50:48,600
difference between Iran and Iraq.

2109
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:49,463
You know what I'm saying?

2110
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,450
As opposed to like doing it in
front of someone who is like,

2111
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:51,990
what the fuck?

2112
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:52,291
You know,

2113
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:53,124
it's all the same.

2114
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,900
She is blow it up,

2115
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:56,503
you know?

2116
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:57,331
So no,

2117
00:50:57,331 --> 00:50:57,541
it's,

2118
00:50:57,541 --> 00:50:57,931
it's so,

2119
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:58,201
it's,

2120
00:50:58,201 --> 00:50:59,190
so it has become a thing.

2121
00:50:59,191 --> 00:51:00,660
What happened was in oh seven,

2122
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:01,440
uh,

2123
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,700
when we were still doing the acts of evil,

2124
00:51:02,701 --> 00:51:02,911
me,

2125
00:51:02,911 --> 00:51:03,601
I'm at an Aaron,

2126
00:51:03,601 --> 00:51:04,530
we went out to,

2127
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:05,730
and this is a tour that you guys,

2128
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,420
we have to oppose us of evil comedies.

2129
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,670
I see evil comedy tour.

2130
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,001
It was,

2131
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:11,970
it actually originally started with Mitzi
shore who put us together and call it

2132
00:51:11,971 --> 00:51:12,900
the Arabian nights.

2133
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,390
This was in 2000.

2134
00:51:15,391 --> 00:51:18,240
She put us to the Arabian nights
and Iranians aren't Arabs.

2135
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,630
So we'd do shows and like inevitably like
Iranians would come up afterwards and

2136
00:51:21,631 --> 00:51:21,901
be like,

2137
00:51:21,901 --> 00:51:22,561
it was a good show,

2138
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:22,950
but a,

2139
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:23,760
we're not Arabs.

2140
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,181
And I was like,

2141
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:24,870
I know.

2142
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:25,180
And He,

2143
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,520
Ronnie's a very sensitive about that.

2144
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,950
I actually read a national
geographic article,

2145
00:51:28,951 --> 00:51:29,190
this,

2146
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,490
this journalist went any Ron.

2147
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,430
I said I was interviewing
people and he goes,

2148
00:51:32,431 --> 00:51:33,270
I asked people,

2149
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:34,920
what do you want the
world to know about you?

2150
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:35,521
He said,

2151
00:51:35,521 --> 00:51:37,950
the first thing they would
always say is we're not Arabs.

2152
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:38,970
The second thing,

2153
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,110
we're not terrorists.

2154
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,600
So it's like it's better to be a
terrorist in an Arab in their mind.

2155
00:51:42,601 --> 00:51:42,811
You know,

2156
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:44,250
that's kind of in America,

2157
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:48,360
we know so little about Iran other than
the Iran hostage crisis and that you

2158
00:51:48,361 --> 00:51:52,110
guys are trying to get nuclear power
and blow shit up all the negative shit.

2159
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,651
Exactly,

2160
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,011
exactly.

2161
00:51:53,011 --> 00:51:57,240
And then we know about this most
recent almost take over the government.

2162
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:57,511
Yeah,

2163
00:51:57,511 --> 00:51:57,961
the green,

2164
00:51:57,961 --> 00:51:59,820
the green movement was supposed the cause.

2165
00:51:59,821 --> 00:52:03,000
What happened was in oh nine there was
elections and there was obviously voter

2166
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:03,810
fraud.

2167
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:04,170
Um,

2168
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,100
but they uh,

2169
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,570
so then there was protests in the streets.

2170
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,230
Actually that was kind of,

2171
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:10,140
that was the first time where I had
Americans coming up to me going like,

2172
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:10,620
wow,

2173
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:11,890
there's so many beautiful women.

2174
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:12,360
Like they're like,

2175
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,320
cause the protesters,

2176
00:52:13,321 --> 00:52:16,080
there was a lot of women in them
and there was dudes in jeans.

2177
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,610
So people would come up and go like,

2178
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,370
oh,

2179
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:20,700
aren't they supposed to be
wearing burkas and turbans?

2180
00:52:20,701 --> 00:52:21,010
I'm like,

2181
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:21,670
no man.

2182
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:22,503
I'm like,

2183
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,960
Toronto is an international city.

2184
00:52:25,961 --> 00:52:26,290
Of it.

2185
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:26,471
Yeah,

2186
00:52:26,471 --> 00:52:31,360
I ran is much more sophisticated and
much more ahead than we've been led on.

2187
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:31,811
I mean,

2188
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:36,270
we've lumped them in with like Pakistan
and Afghanistan and even those,

2189
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,350
I mean like Afghanistan,

2190
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:37,981
it's probably the,

2191
00:52:37,981 --> 00:52:39,810
the one that's like the least developed,

2192
00:52:39,811 --> 00:52:40,320
you know.

2193
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,430
But even those countries,

2194
00:52:41,431 --> 00:52:44,930
like if they have a lot of western
influences and also a lot of,

2195
00:52:44,931 --> 00:52:45,210
you know,

2196
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,580
especially with technology and stuff
now there's a lot of people that are

2197
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,401
advanced in this country,

2198
00:52:48,401 --> 00:52:49,920
especially if you going to a major city,

2199
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:50,611
you know,

2200
00:52:50,611 --> 00:52:52,860
you're going to see it's
the hustle and bustle.

2201
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,030
You're going to see some dude driving.

2202
00:52:54,031 --> 00:52:56,820
A Mercedes Benz is a multimillionaire
and you can see some dude like pushing a

2203
00:52:56,821 --> 00:52:58,800
cart who's making five
bucks a year or something.

2204
00:52:58,801 --> 00:52:59,634
You know what I'm saying?

2205
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:00,151
So this,

2206
00:53:00,151 --> 00:53:00,984
this exists,

2207
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:01,441
but it's like,

2208
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:05,550
I think a lot of people's image of the
Middle East is just dudes and turbans and

2209
00:53:05,551 --> 00:53:06,660
women in Burkas.

2210
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,351
And it's like,

2211
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:07,681
first of all,

2212
00:53:07,681 --> 00:53:08,514
the Burka is like,

2213
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,130
you know,

2214
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:09,440
is,

2215
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,010
is pretty exclusive to like,

2216
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:11,790
uh,

2217
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,170
Afghanistan where they would wear the,

2218
00:53:13,171 --> 00:53:13,381
you know,

2219
00:53:13,381 --> 00:53:17,400
the full thing with the blue thing under
the Taliban where they had to cover

2220
00:53:17,401 --> 00:53:18,700
themselves and they could just barely see.

2221
00:53:18,701 --> 00:53:19,770
I like that Little Mesh.

2222
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:20,730
I love that shit.

2223
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,500
I would love my girlfriend
and where that shit,

2224
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,240
it could be kind of sexy.

2225
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:26,160
That's

2226
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,420
the weakest pimp move.

2227
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:29,170
No,

2228
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:29,271
no,

2229
00:53:29,271 --> 00:53:29,441
no,

2230
00:53:29,441 --> 00:53:29,570
no,

2231
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:29,770
no.

2232
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:30,720
Cover everything.

2233
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:32,530
Even your nose.

2234
00:53:32,531 --> 00:53:32,850
Yeah.

2235
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:33,530
I let her keep it.

2236
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:36,350
Cut The tits out or something and
just saying that would be fine.

2237
00:53:36,351 --> 00:53:36,861
Just the size.

2238
00:53:36,861 --> 00:53:37,910
What's the stars over the netball?

2239
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,150
She had market that online.

2240
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:39,984
See people buy it.

2241
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,280
I think you found your niche,

2242
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,383
your niche,

2243
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:44,370
a burqa,

2244
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:44,671
burqa,

2245
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:45,060
sex,

2246
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,530
gay sex clothes.

2247
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,390
There was a woman at the mall in Texas.

2248
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:51,300
I was in Texas recently and there's a
woman at the mall that was in full gear.

2249
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,340
All they could see was
her eyes and I was like,

2250
00:53:53,341 --> 00:53:53,731
wow,

2251
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:54,361
this is crazy.

2252
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,230
She's really going,

2253
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:55,770
you know,

2254
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,630
she's going fucking biblical.

2255
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,000
That's Texas.

2256
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:00,853
That's hot.

2257
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,310
That's what we did,

2258
00:54:02,311 --> 00:54:02,750
actually

2259
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,810
did a show in Saudi
Arabia with Ahmed and uh,

2260
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:06,703
and uh,

2261
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:06,921
you know,

2262
00:54:06,921 --> 00:54:07,521
after the show,

2263
00:54:07,521 --> 00:54:09,950
a lot of people that come to our shows
are either they'd be the travel in the

2264
00:54:09,951 --> 00:54:10,251
west,

2265
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:14,000
are their western educated or their ex
pats so you don't have to show taking

2266
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,110
pictures and all the people coming up.

2267
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:17,060
And this one girl came up in one of those,

2268
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:20,180
it's like she was fully covering stuff
for the eyes and she took a picture with

2269
00:54:20,181 --> 00:54:21,014
us and I was like,

2270
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:21,621
what the fuck?

2271
00:54:21,621 --> 00:54:22,500
Like no one's gonna like,

2272
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,350
it's like you could be anybody.

2273
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,320
It has like that Superhero Vida.

2274
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,040
Like you don't know who this person is.

2275
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:33,470
You don't have to kind of take off their
burger and in most beautiful woman in

2276
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:33,981
the ride,

2277
00:54:33,981 --> 00:54:34,281
you know,

2278
00:54:34,281 --> 00:54:36,440
I love that subservient to you.

2279
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:36,720
Right.

2280
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,553
You and only you,

2281
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,230
he actually washes your feet.

2282
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:41,290
She brings me no,

2283
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,690
it's fun.

2284
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:42,081
It's funny.

2285
00:54:42,081 --> 00:54:42,540
It's funny

2286
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,040
because actually in d cause so now,

2287
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:44,400
so you've got,

2288
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,510
so you've got the burka,

2289
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:48,300
which is Afghanistan and he got like
the veil kind of thing with the ice

2290
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:49,050
covered,

2291
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:51,870
which is like a Saudi
Arabia do that a lot.

2292
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:55,170
Then like in Iran you get some that are
religious that will cover like their

2293
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:55,921
hair and everything,

2294
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,180
but you see the full face.

2295
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,040
Then you got like Dubai,

2296
00:54:59,190 --> 00:54:59,550
we've got,

2297
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:00,930
you've got these girls is ridiculous.

2298
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:01,501
They uh,

2299
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:03,480
they were the like the thing and um,

2300
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:04,130
and,

2301
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,370
and but it's all like,

2302
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,330
they're blinged out.

2303
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,171
Like you'll see,

2304
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:09,300
you'll see like designer shoes does.

2305
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:09,751
Even the,

2306
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:10,980
even the thing that covers him,

2307
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:13,890
they'll put like a little
diamond studs on them and stuff.

2308
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,341
Real.

2309
00:55:14,341 --> 00:55:15,300
It's the weirdest thing.

2310
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,111
Yeah.

2311
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:17,160
And then do it,

2312
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:17,761
it's actually,

2313
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:17,911
they're,

2314
00:55:17,911 --> 00:55:18,121
they're,

2315
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:18,331
they're,

2316
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:19,021
they're pretty cute.

2317
00:55:19,021 --> 00:55:22,860
Like they'll take like [inaudible] and
then there's this become this thing there

2318
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,970
now where like the women,

2319
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:24,631
it's weird,

2320
00:55:24,631 --> 00:55:25,321
like they want their,

2321
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,210
like the hair to seem like it's puffier.

2322
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:30,900
So they'll take like a can like thing
like this and they'll roll hair up in a

2323
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:32,130
bump and then they put it there.

2324
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:32,911
So it looks kind of,

2325
00:55:32,911 --> 00:55:34,820
it looks very like star wars.

2326
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:35,000
He,

2327
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,740
you know,

2328
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,330
princess in Star Wars,

2329
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:38,710
they might as well be star wars.

2330
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:39,970
He would those crazy robes.

2331
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:41,470
B One Kenobi.

2332
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:41,770
Shit.

2333
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:41,981
Yeah,

2334
00:55:41,981 --> 00:55:42,311
it is.

2335
00:55:42,311 --> 00:55:43,800
It is some Obi Obi wan Kenobi.

2336
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,051
Actually,

2337
00:55:44,051 --> 00:55:45,140
you know what the Obi wan Kenobi,

2338
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,420
you know what I was in?

2339
00:55:46,421 --> 00:55:47,200
Um,

2340
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,180
I went to Morocco just to travel,

2341
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:49,991
not to do shows.

2342
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:50,751
This was years ago.

2343
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:53,410
I went to Morocco and we went to Fez,

2344
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,640
which is the coolest place.

2345
00:55:54,641 --> 00:55:55,850
The Fas cap comes from that,

2346
00:55:55,851 --> 00:55:56,021
you know,

2347
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:56,621
the first cap,

2348
00:55:56,621 --> 00:55:58,600
the like the like that
with a little thing.

2349
00:55:59,260 --> 00:55:59,810
Anyway,

2350
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:01,240
and they told us,

2351
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,450
I went there with,

2352
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:04,840
now my wife who was in my
girlfriend and she had been,

2353
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,400
she was studying in the south of Spain,

2354
00:56:06,401 --> 00:56:09,160
so we'd like took a boat over
and we had no preparation.

2355
00:56:09,161 --> 00:56:09,994
Like you should,

2356
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,500
you should research before you go.

2357
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:13,420
So we're like on our way on the boat,

2358
00:56:13,421 --> 00:56:15,370
we're reading this like
little guidebook and it goes,

2359
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:16,570
whatever you do,

2360
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,760
don't accept a guide because they're
going to infest they're gonna try and come

2361
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:22,810
up to you and want to be your,

2362
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:26,170
and talk to the hotel to get you a guide.

2363
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:26,951
We didn't have it.

2364
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:27,880
We didn't have a hotel.

2365
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:29,110
Like we didn't know where
we're going to stay.

2366
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:29,981
And My,

2367
00:56:29,981 --> 00:56:31,000
and my girlfriend at the time,

2368
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:31,501
it kept saying that.

2369
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:31,961
She said,

2370
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:32,794
um,

2371
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,000
my wife that she's like,

2372
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,680
we need to go to the old city.

2373
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,220
That's really,

2374
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,240
I supposed to be really nice.

2375
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:38,074
The Old City.

2376
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:39,280
Now I don't speak Arabic,

2377
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:40,150
I speak Farsi.

2378
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,050
So I had no idea.

2379
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:42,610
You say old city in Arabic,

2380
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,391
but the Moroccans,

2381
00:56:43,391 --> 00:56:44,380
they speak French.

2382
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:44,711
I take,

2383
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:45,940
I take it three years of French.

2384
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,500
So the whole time in the train I'm like,

2385
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:49,210
how do you say Old City and French?

2386
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:49,541
I'm like,

2387
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:51,100
is it less sita?

2388
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,090
You know?

2389
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:52,960
Vecchio you know,

2390
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:53,201
I was like,

2391
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:53,741
that's not it.

2392
00:56:53,741 --> 00:56:54,730
So I finally asked him,

2393
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:54,941
dude,

2394
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:55,270
he's like,

2395
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:55,541
oh,

2396
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:58,570
[inaudible] v means the
ancient city lost the old veal.

2397
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,130
So,

2398
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:02,050
so our plan was just land in Fez,

2399
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,130
find a cab and say,

2400
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:04,150
take us to [inaudible].

2401
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,720
So we're getting a cab and the cab
drivers like where in the luncheonette and

2402
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:08,240
lost the Advil.

2403
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:08,770
And I'm like,

2404
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:10,330
just [inaudible] you know,

2405
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:11,620
he's like a hotel.

2406
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:11,921
I'm like,

2407
00:57:11,921 --> 00:57:12,191
yeah.

2408
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,810
I was like,

2409
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:12,881
oh,

2410
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:14,080
they just go to some hotels.

2411
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:15,670
So the do takes us a,

2412
00:57:15,671 --> 00:57:18,280
we go into the ancient city and
then right when we get there,

2413
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:19,960
some guy like flags him down.

2414
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:20,800
He comes,

2415
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,730
the dude walks over the passenger side
and leans his head in his says something

2416
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:25,511
in Arabic to the,

2417
00:57:25,511 --> 00:57:26,344
to the driver.

2418
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:27,850
And then he leans to us,

2419
00:57:27,851 --> 00:57:28,570
he goes,

2420
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,081
hello,

2421
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:30,130
I will show you.

2422
00:57:30,131 --> 00:57:31,150
You look for hotel.

2423
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:31,631
He sounded like,

2424
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:31,971
borrow it.

2425
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:33,880
I sorta got you look for hotel.

2426
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:34,541
Uh,

2427
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:35,350
and we're like,

2428
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:35,590
uh,

2429
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:35,831
no,

2430
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:36,401
we're okay.

2431
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:36,731
He's like,

2432
00:57:36,731 --> 00:57:37,031
no,

2433
00:57:37,031 --> 00:57:37,760
I will show it.

2434
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,351
Don't worry.

2435
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:39,340
And he got into the car.

2436
00:57:39,341 --> 00:57:39,611
I'm like,

2437
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:39,911
Shit,

2438
00:57:39,911 --> 00:57:40,744
we're getting kidnapped.

2439
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,640
And he takes us to some like,

2440
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,220
like,

2441
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:43,761
like the,

2442
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,220
they have these like old homes
that have turned into hotels.

2443
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,140
It was really nice,

2444
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:48,910
but like nobody was staying there.

2445
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,470
So he takes us there anyway,

2446
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:52,390
so he becomes our guide unintentionally.

2447
00:57:52,391 --> 00:57:53,224
He's now our guide,

2448
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,170
told them those or avoid,

2449
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:55,721
I've told my wife,

2450
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:55,931
I'm like,

2451
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:56,410
Shit.

2452
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:57,221
Now we've got a guide,

2453
00:57:57,221 --> 00:57:58,031
like how do we tell him no?

2454
00:57:58,031 --> 00:57:58,540
He's like,

2455
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,590
don't worry you don't.

2456
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,410
I show you around if you like,

2457
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:05,520
then maybe you can give some leading
me like bring up the money thing and he

2458
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:05,890
says,

2459
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:06,430
he's like,

2460
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:07,061
let me take you here.

2461
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:07,630
Then he said,

2462
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,110
let me take you kick that
motherfucker right out of there.

2463
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,620
It's one of these situations
though where you're like,

2464
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:11,801
okay,

2465
00:58:11,801 --> 00:58:12,880
this guy's a local.

2466
00:58:12,881 --> 00:58:13,271
He kind of,

2467
00:58:13,271 --> 00:58:15,190
I mean you feel intimidated
because you like,

2468
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:16,960
they know each other somehow.

2469
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:17,081
Like,

2470
00:58:17,081 --> 00:58:18,160
I don't want to let you just,

2471
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:18,641
you kind of like,

2472
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:19,271
let's go along,

2473
00:58:19,271 --> 00:58:20,980
but just be ready to run at any minute.

2474
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,530
So we ended up in some,

2475
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,101
he's like,

2476
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:25,150
let me take you for dinner.

2477
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,110
We go to this restaurant.

2478
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:26,651
I'm not kidding.

2479
00:58:26,651 --> 00:58:28,330
There was like balloons and banners.

2480
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:29,320
All this shit was up,

2481
00:58:29,321 --> 00:58:30,154
but there was no one.

2482
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,060
We were the only two eating
in the restaurant and the
waiter comes to the waiter

2483
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:35,380
was so excited to see us.

2484
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:35,771
He's like,

2485
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:36,041
hello,

2486
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:36,550
hello.

2487
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:40,450
And it's like the waiter was the
waiter slash the cook slash the owner.

2488
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:43,170
Like he would like go cook in the back
and they come sit and watch us eat.

2489
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:44,350
It was the craziest shit.

2490
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:44,880
Wow.

2491
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,270
But the OBI wan Kenobi Shit,

2492
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:48,880
those crazy is these guides.

2493
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:52,820
They actually were the
Obi wan Kenobi like the,

2494
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,400
the gown with the hat,

2495
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:55,840
like during the day they wear it.

2496
00:58:55,841 --> 00:58:57,940
And that's the official like fairs,

2497
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,130
like guide outfit like that.

2498
00:59:00,131 --> 00:59:01,600
Like that's an official guide.

2499
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:03,820
Like the government I think
recognizes them as guides.

2500
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:06,940
And the weird one when I realized
it was Obi wan Kenobi and I,

2501
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:07,361
and I was like,

2502
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:07,661
I was like,

2503
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:11,350
George Lucas must've come to fairs and
come up with this because my wife and I,

2504
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:12,700
the next day she got the guy goes,

2505
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,800
I'm going to show you the castle today.

2506
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:15,580
And we're like,

2507
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:16,150
alright.

2508
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:18,130
So he takes us to like the castle.

2509
00:59:18,131 --> 00:59:18,461
He's like,

2510
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:18,941
okay,

2511
00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:20,170
I cannot come close.

2512
00:59:20,171 --> 00:59:20,741
You Go,

2513
00:59:20,741 --> 00:59:21,574
I come,

2514
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,050
I see you at other sides.

2515
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,500
I guess they don't let the guides come.

2516
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:25,221
So should we go?

2517
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:26,150
We take a picture too.

2518
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,400
And then we're like how's it going?

2519
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:28,041
I'm going to find us.

2520
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:30,470
And we start walking and across the,

2521
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:34,220
and I'm looking for the guy literally
across the street in one of those Obi wan

2522
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:34,551
Kenobi.

2523
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:37,100
Cause that's what he's shown up with
Obi wan Kenobi off is like with the hood

2524
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:37,760
on.

2525
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,600
He's kind of cross the street watching
us nodding and he's like keep walking.

2526
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,970
So he kind of kept an eye on us
and you know how like in Star Wars,

2527
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:45,740
like ob one was kind of weird like that,

2528
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:45,950
like,

2529
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,090
like disappeared.

2530
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:47,960
So I was like,

2531
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,010
I was like George Lucas must've come here
and gotten a guide and then it came up

2532
00:59:52,011 --> 00:59:53,330
with the fucking Obi wan Kenobi.

2533
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:53,811
Wow.

2534
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:54,770
That's so weird.

2535
00:59:54,771 --> 00:59:57,110
So how long has this guide outfit existed?

2536
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:57,401
Dude,

2537
00:59:57,401 --> 00:59:58,340
the guide outfit was,

2538
00:59:58,341 --> 01:00:01,250
is like day day outfit and
then by night he would show up.

2539
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:02,390
Kind of dress regularly.

2540
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:03,280
But whoa,

2541
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:04,130
that's so strange.

2542
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,180
How long did he,

2543
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:06,920
you ask how many years
they'd been doing this?

2544
01:00:06,921 --> 01:00:07,280
I said,

2545
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,480
we ain't turn tradition.

2546
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:08,731
We,

2547
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:09,570
I didn't ask him about that.

2548
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:10,580
I didn't ask him about the outfit.

2549
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:10,910
I just,

2550
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:13,970
I just realized there was a bunch of
guys with the outfit around like it was,

2551
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:16,760
it was basically you'd have like your
clothes underneath and you just throw the

2552
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:17,900
robot and it's almost like,

2553
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:18,411
yeah,

2554
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:18,951
it's almost like,

2555
01:00:18,951 --> 01:00:19,131
you know,

2556
01:00:19,131 --> 01:00:19,910
like a judge.

2557
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:21,200
Like they just put it over.

2558
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,150
Did you ever have a pet
monkey that robbed you?

2559
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:24,480
There was a pet monkey to rock.

2560
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:25,943
There was,

2561
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:29,330
it's funny you say that
because they actually,

2562
01:00:29,331 --> 01:00:29,700
first of all,

2563
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,550
they do have pet monkeys
out there that like,

2564
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:32,713
like um,

2565
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,220
do,

2566
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,100
do tricks and stuff.

2567
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:37,400
But what he did was he took us
to a rug store that he's like,

2568
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:38,690
you want to see rugs?

2569
01:00:38,691 --> 01:00:39,231
And I'm like,

2570
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:41,150
and at the time I was
living in with my mom,

2571
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,800
like I was dating my girlfriend,

2572
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:45,530
but I was living with my mom
and I didn't have an apartment,

2573
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:46,940
so I had nowhere to put rugs.

2574
01:00:46,941 --> 01:00:47,181
I was like,

2575
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:47,331
no,

2576
01:00:47,331 --> 01:00:48,164
I don't need a rug.

2577
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:48,650
He's like,

2578
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:48,780
dude,

2579
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:49,311
just come.

2580
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:50,144
We look at the rug,

2581
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:50,511
you know?

2582
01:00:50,511 --> 01:00:51,231
And so finally,

2583
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,220
like we go into this place,

2584
01:00:52,221 --> 01:00:52,620
these guys,

2585
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,100
the Moroccans are the
biggest sales people.

2586
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,030
Like they will like,

2587
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:56,930
they will fucking,

2588
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:59,900
they will push you to
you buy like the guy,

2589
01:00:59,901 --> 01:01:01,000
he came Isaac like you want,

2590
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:02,060
I look at the rugs,

2591
01:01:02,061 --> 01:01:02,481
I was like,

2592
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:03,560
I don't really want to look at right.

2593
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:03,831
He's like,

2594
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:04,341
just look,

2595
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:05,174
it's okay.

2596
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:05,601
So,

2597
01:01:05,601 --> 01:01:07,130
and then they bring you up mint tea.

2598
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:09,170
So now I'm looking at my girl.

2599
01:01:09,171 --> 01:01:09,411
I'm like,

2600
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:09,501
Oh,

2601
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:10,031
this is fun.

2602
01:01:10,031 --> 01:01:11,390
They're going to give us free tea.

2603
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:12,860
And all we gotta do look at some rugs.

2604
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:13,431
And he's like,

2605
01:01:13,431 --> 01:01:13,821
okay,

2606
01:01:13,821 --> 01:01:15,320
out of these 10 we'd do like,

2607
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:15,770
I'm like,

2608
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:15,921
Aww.

2609
01:01:15,921 --> 01:01:16,754
Those are kind of Nice.

2610
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:17,241
He's like,

2611
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:17,451
okay,

2612
01:01:17,451 --> 01:01:18,350
I give to you for,

2613
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:18,621

2614
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:19,160
whatever,

2615
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,200
$5,000.

2616
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:20,451
I'm like,

2617
01:01:20,451 --> 01:01:20,750
dude,

2618
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,530
I don't have a place to put them.

2619
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:22,791
He's like,

2620
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:23,091
okay,

2621
01:01:23,091 --> 01:01:24,230
which three do you like?

2622
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:25,581
It was like,

2623
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:26,414
I don't want any,

2624
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:27,680
he started negotiating.

2625
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:29,090
I didn't even know I was negotiating.

2626
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,661
Finally.

2627
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:30,051
I'm like,

2628
01:01:30,051 --> 01:01:30,884
okay,

2629
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:31,251
first of all,

2630
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:31,820
I'm waiting for my,

2631
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,061

2632
01:01:32,061 --> 01:01:33,380

2633
01:01:33,381 --> 01:01:33,861

2634
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:34,940
we don't want to fuck a rose.

2635
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,680
But she's just sitting there going like,

2636
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:37,910
she's think cause later on I asked her,

2637
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:38,121
I was like,

2638
01:01:38,121 --> 01:01:38,601
why don't you bust?

2639
01:01:38,601 --> 01:01:38,931
And she's like,

2640
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:40,370
I thought you're the man
you're going to take.

2641
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,091
I was like,

2642
01:01:41,091 --> 01:01:41,241
no,

2643
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:41,961
you've got to come in.

2644
01:01:41,961 --> 01:01:43,040
It's like the tight ass.

2645
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,233
And then finally,

2646
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:44,720
um,

2647
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,710
what was funny was I was like,

2648
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:46,221
oh I got,

2649
01:01:46,221 --> 01:01:50,720
I got the Trump card here because it was
literally in some back alley with like

2650
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,140
bike,

2651
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:51,771
like barely,

2652
01:01:51,771 --> 01:01:53,540
like they barely had like,

2653
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:53,990
like,

2654
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,651
like the door,

2655
01:01:54,651 --> 01:01:55,310
like you know,

2656
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:56,270
it was all old school.

2657
01:01:56,271 --> 01:01:56,421
Like,

2658
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,111
like the bells.

2659
01:01:57,111 --> 01:01:59,630
Like when there was like nothing
technical about the place.

2660
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:00,091
I'm like,

2661
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,340
I got the Trump card right here.

2662
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:02,361
I'm just going to let the dude,

2663
01:02:02,361 --> 01:02:03,020
no,

2664
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,190
I got no cash bro.

2665
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,170
I got credit cards and I said that.

2666
01:02:06,171 --> 01:02:07,000
And he's like,

2667
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,740
we have credit card machine went and got,

2668
01:02:09,741 --> 01:02:11,290
those are the old roller,

2669
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:11,631
you know,

2670
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:12,464
the old thing.

2671
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:13,101
And,

2672
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:13,480
uh,

2673
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:13,911
and then,

2674
01:02:13,911 --> 01:02:14,780
and then they fucking,

2675
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:16,430
they sold me three rugs.

2676
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:18,490
I'm not kidding.

2677
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:19,740
And the funny thing is,

2678
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:20,270
um,

2679
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:22,200
the shift it to the America
and I'm not kidding,

2680
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,660
I had no place to sit up
to put them for six months.

2681
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:28,280
I drove around with three rugs
in my trunk and I was just like,

2682
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,133
I like,

2683
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,560
I gave him a way to relatives
that had apartments.

2684
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:34,830
Like I actually have started to talk
about it in a standup and I go like,

2685
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:36,840
for six months I was going around
trying to sell it to relatives,

2686
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:37,021
you know?

2687
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:37,201
No,

2688
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:37,741
you just look,

2689
01:02:37,741 --> 01:02:38,401
have some mint tea,

2690
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:39,234
you know,

2691
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,100
but that's how they get you mad.

2692
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:41,671
But it's like,

2693
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:41,821
what?

2694
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:42,491
That's like we,

2695
01:02:42,491 --> 01:02:42,661
you know,

2696
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:43,441
1200 bucks,

2697
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:43,770
man,

2698
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:44,401
1200 bucks.

2699
01:02:44,401 --> 01:02:44,641
I was like,

2700
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:45,840
I have no idea of what they were.

2701
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:47,160
I don't know if they're worth it.

2702
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:48,030
I have no idea.

2703
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:48,810
He scored.

2704
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:49,643
He scored on you.

2705
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:49,980
Oh yeah.

2706
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:50,890
They ate for,

2707
01:02:50,891 --> 01:02:51,780
for a month.

2708
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,020
It's funny how many cultures
there are like that,

2709
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:55,040
that barter and you know,

2710
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:55,251
like,

2711
01:02:55,251 --> 01:02:55,780
you know,

2712
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,500
try to get you to buy
things on the street.

2713
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:57,930
Oh yeah.

2714
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:00,290
Street peddling is like a big
part of a lot of cultures.

2715
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,153
Oh yeah.

2716
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,620
That freaked me out when
I first went to Tijuana.

2717
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:04,430
Oh yeah.

2718
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:07,970
I'd never seen that before in and mass
where people just selling everything in

2719
01:03:07,971 --> 01:03:08,271
the street.

2720
01:03:08,271 --> 01:03:08,750
Every,

2721
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:09,800
this was like way back in.

2722
01:03:09,801 --> 01:03:11,000
Then I went with wheels.

2723
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:11,541
Oh yeah.

2724
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:12,540
Wheels were Dreezy.

2725
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:12,661
Yeah.

2726
01:03:12,661 --> 01:03:13,401
Wheels per easy.

2727
01:03:13,401 --> 01:03:16,700
We're doing the comedy store
in La Jolla and wheels.

2728
01:03:16,701 --> 01:03:17,570
Didn't even know how to get there.

2729
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:17,991
I go.

2730
01:03:17,991 --> 01:03:18,681
Do you know how to go there?

2731
01:03:18,681 --> 01:03:18,831
Yeah,

2732
01:03:18,831 --> 01:03:19,011
yeah,

2733
01:03:19,011 --> 01:03:19,191
yeah.

2734
01:03:19,191 --> 01:03:19,850
I know.

2735
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,290
I didn't know where the fuck he was going.

2736
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:21,831
I'm like,

2737
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:22,620
how do we get back to him?

2738
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:22,851
I go,

2739
01:03:22,851 --> 01:03:23,181
yeah,

2740
01:03:23,181 --> 01:03:23,721
I'm not sure.

2741
01:03:23,721 --> 01:03:24,554
I'm not sure.

2742
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,540
Totally lost no navigation systems,

2743
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,970
but this is like the
late nineties and Shit,

2744
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:29,180
you know?

2745
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,830
No one knew where you were a lost man.

2746
01:03:30,831 --> 01:03:31,131
I was like,

2747
01:03:31,131 --> 01:03:32,810
we gotta get the fuck out of Mexico.

2748
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,131
I was in Mexico.

2749
01:03:34,131 --> 01:03:35,720
I was in Tijuana for 20 minutes.

2750
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:36,471
I was like,

2751
01:03:36,471 --> 01:03:37,550
this is crazy.

2752
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:38,481
It's like,

2753
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,920
I couldn't believe this stark contrast
between San Diego cross the border.

2754
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,300
All of a sudden you're in a third world.

2755
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:44,870
Whoa.

2756
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:45,520
Like this is,

2757
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,450
this is hookers everywhere.

2758
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,230
You know,

2759
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:51,350
girls walking the street
and you see guns open,

2760
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:52,820
open guns.

2761
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:57,170
He was like so many creepy little fucking
spots and we were driving around these

2762
01:03:57,171 --> 01:03:59,100
little weird cities and
I'm going to Toyota,

2763
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:04,101
super a turbo shiny little looking like
an la Douche bag looking like a victim

2764
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:05,710
and the federal Raleigh's look for you.

2765
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:08,890
That's the problem in these places is
the cops or even you got to look out for

2766
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:09,724
the cops.

2767
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:10,781
They're trying to rob you,

2768
01:04:10,781 --> 01:04:10,960
man.

2769
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,550
I had that in Mexico where the guy,

2770
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:13,900
cause then what they do is like,

2771
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,321
first of all,

2772
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:15,700
you walk into like the Mexican,

2773
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,020
the Mexican bazaar.

2774
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:18,370
I went into like,

2775
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:19,600
there was nobody there.

2776
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:20,770
It was a dead.

2777
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:21,640
It was like middle of the day.

2778
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:22,391
No one's there.

2779
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:23,470
And I walk in and the guy's like,

2780
01:04:23,471 --> 01:04:23,651
hey,

2781
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,450
you want to buy like a bag or whatever.

2782
01:04:25,451 --> 01:04:26,710
You want to buy a shoes?

2783
01:04:26,711 --> 01:04:26,951
I'm like,

2784
01:04:26,951 --> 01:04:27,101
no,

2785
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:27,371
it's all right.

2786
01:04:27,371 --> 01:04:28,060
He's like,

2787
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:28,990
I bought some weed.

2788
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:29,291
I'm like,

2789
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:29,561
no,

2790
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:30,430
he's like cocaine.

2791
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:30,671
I'm like,

2792
01:04:30,671 --> 01:04:30,870
no.

2793
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:33,040
And then then he's like fucking pussy.

2794
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:34,750
Like they like turn on.

2795
01:04:34,751 --> 01:04:35,171
You're like,

2796
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:35,971
what happened man,

2797
01:04:35,971 --> 01:04:36,804
we were Bros,

2798
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:37,620
you

2799
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:38,550
fucking pussy.

2800
01:04:38,551 --> 01:04:39,810
Just cause I don't want your heroine.

2801
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:41,940
Maybe we gotta get Outta here man.

2802
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:42,810
Yeah,

2803
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,140
Mexico is a trip you place.

2804
01:04:44,141 --> 01:04:46,350
It's so strange that it's connected.

2805
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:46,861
You know,

2806
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:47,641
and people don't,

2807
01:04:47,641 --> 01:04:49,470
don't seem to recognize that threat.

2808
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,080
The fact that it's connected the oxen,

2809
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,250
they actually said that
this Mckean just came out.

2810
01:04:53,251 --> 01:04:53,461
Not,

2811
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:54,390
not that this means anything,

2812
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:57,630
but McCain just came out and said that
giant forest fire they have going on

2813
01:04:57,631 --> 01:04:59,100
right now and at an Arizona,

2814
01:04:59,250 --> 01:04:59,791
you know about that,

2815
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:00,270
right.

2816
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:02,540
Huge out of control wildfire.

2817
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:05,670
And they think it was started by
illegal immigrants setting up camp.

2818
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:06,370
Oh Wow.

2819
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:06,820
You know,

2820
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,590
there's a lot of guys,

2821
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:09,740
they crossed the border in Arizona said,

2822
01:05:09,741 --> 01:05:10,080
you know,

2823
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,050
we'll do a campfires and shit and
just forgot to put the campfire out.

2824
01:05:13,051 --> 01:05:13,560
Shit.

2825
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:16,770
Giant fucking 140,000 Acre wouldn't it?

2826
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:17,950
How acres it is now.

2827
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,480
That's crazy.

2828
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,091
It's insane.

2829
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:19,900
But it's uh,

2830
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:24,040
I'm actually scheduled to do some
show in Mexico like in the fall.

2831
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,300
And what's funny is like,

2832
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:25,451
you know,

2833
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:27,430
people are always scared of
the Middle East and stuff,

2834
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,770
but like my wife and I
were talking about like,

2835
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,830
you know all these kidnappings and
stuff going on in Mexico and it's like,

2836
01:05:32,831 --> 01:05:35,680
is it worth going down there and you know,

2837
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,880
I'm thinking about the
same thing like Cabo.

2838
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:40,510
I was just thinking of
going somewhere in Mexico,

2839
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,130
but is it even worth going?

2840
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:43,630
I heard that if you go to resorts,

2841
01:05:43,631 --> 01:05:44,110
you're fine.

2842
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,980
My friend Matt just got back from Cabo.

2843
01:05:45,981 --> 01:05:47,110
How goes to cobble all the time?

2844
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:47,890
He loves it.

2845
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:48,350
It's a combo.

2846
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:49,270
Supposed to still be nice,

2847
01:05:49,271 --> 01:05:50,770
but there's Acapulco,

2848
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:52,210
which is real dangerous now.

2849
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:53,800
Aga bogos supposed to be dangerous.

2850
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:55,450
Can't coons supposed
to be a little tricky.

2851
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:56,590
They've for the most part,

2852
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:58,130
avoid the resort towns.

2853
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:58,520
They don't want,

2854
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,130
didn't want to fuck up
business for everybody,

2855
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,470
but in Acapulco they've
Jack People in resorts.

2856
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:02,980
Yeah,

2857
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:03,420
I could.

2858
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,230
Poco was apparently
pretty shady right now,

2859
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,780
but a cabo is supposed to be still good.

2860
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:08,860
I was in Cabo was good.

2861
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:09,970
It was a nice resort.

2862
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:10,781
It's actually funny.

2863
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:13,420
Before all this was kind
of going on like five,

2864
01:06:13,421 --> 01:06:17,800
six years ago I went to Cabo and we were
staying at the Hilton and it was a nice

2865
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:19,270
place and it was Kinda,

2866
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:20,170
it was kinda funny cause he's,

2867
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,120
cause everyone's out there obviously,

2868
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:26,110
you know tourists and the bathing
suits and these two dudes showed up.

2869
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:27,370
It was like the,

2870
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:27,761
it was,

2871
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:28,800
it was like keystone cop.

2872
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,700
It wasn't keeping me was like,

2873
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,360
it was like bumbling idiot criminals.

2874
01:06:31,361 --> 01:06:31,841
They showed up.

2875
01:06:31,841 --> 01:06:33,010
These two guys with,

2876
01:06:33,011 --> 01:06:34,450
with empty bags,

2877
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:39,640
like duffle bags almost a with their
shirts off as if they're tourists with

2878
01:06:39,641 --> 01:06:42,130
genes obviously not tourists.

2879
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:42,220
Like,

2880
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:44,650
and the reason these two Mexican
dudes walking around the pool,

2881
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,510
like just checking shit out.

2882
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,540
It like look at least walking around
looking for a place to like they start

2883
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:50,340
snatching things and I,

2884
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,161
and I looked at my wife,

2885
01:06:51,161 --> 01:06:51,890
I was like,

2886
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:53,530
did those guys seem like they fit in here?

2887
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:53,951
She's like,

2888
01:06:53,951 --> 01:06:54,281
no.

2889
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:54,551
It was like,

2890
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:57,490
I better tell somebody and
went over till the management.

2891
01:06:57,491 --> 01:07:00,940
Like those two dudes don't look like
their hotel clients and the next thing you

2892
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:02,020
know they're getting escorted out.

2893
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,041
They walked in,

2894
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:06,080
but it's like they did not buy
or invest in a bathing suit.

2895
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:06,550
So you see,

2896
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:06,821
look,

2897
01:07:06,821 --> 01:07:07,654
the part,

2898
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,980
they were in there with their jeans,

2899
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:10,060
with their shirts off,

2900
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:10,721
you know,

2901
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:11,800
obviously not,

2902
01:07:11,801 --> 01:07:12,370
you know,

2903
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:13,960
just did not fit in at all.

2904
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:15,640
It's weird how quickly it's changed.

2905
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:19,480
I went on vacation in
Cancun I think in like 2000,

2906
01:07:19,481 --> 01:07:20,314
2001.

2907
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,160
And uh,

2908
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,540
I wouldn't even think
about going there now.

2909
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:23,160
Yeah,

2910
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,040
it's too bad too.

2911
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:26,070
There's so many spots I want to see.

2912
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:26,321
Oh,

2913
01:07:26,321 --> 01:07:28,060
I want to see all sorts of,

2914
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:28,360
uh,

2915
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,440
the Mayan ruins.

2916
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:31,750
So many did plume and uh,

2917
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:32,141
you know,

2918
01:07:32,141 --> 01:07:34,960
I've been to Cheech and EATSA and
there's ones outside of Mexico City.

2919
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:35,860
I would love to see them.

2920
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:36,041
I mean,

2921
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:36,820
they're incredible.

2922
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,510
I guess there's that,

2923
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:38,770
that exhibit in Caba,

2924
01:07:38,771 --> 01:07:39,850
that underwater,

2925
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:40,150
uh,

2926
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:40,811
art exhibit.

2927
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:43,990
Have you seen it where it's just a bunch
of statues underneath the water and you

2928
01:07:43,991 --> 01:07:44,711
can go down there?

2929
01:07:44,711 --> 01:07:48,160
I think it's scuba dive or do something
like that where there's just this huge

2930
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,520
art piece underneath the ocean recently.

2931
01:07:51,521 --> 01:07:52,230
Someone's put,

2932
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:52,580
yeah,

2933
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:52,870
yeah,

2934
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:53,703
yeah.

2935
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,210
And I guess if you're a good artist,

2936
01:07:55,211 --> 01:07:56,950
they will let you add your own work to it.

2937
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,210
Like if you're real hard.

2938
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:58,991
So it's Kinda cool.

2939
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:02,470
So all these really good artists have
been adding things to it and I guess it's

2940
01:08:02,471 --> 01:08:03,490
just amazing.

2941
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:05,710
And the only way you can get to this,

2942
01:08:05,711 --> 01:08:06,461
why scuba diving?

2943
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:07,001
I think so.

2944
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:07,571
I'm not sure.

2945
01:08:07,571 --> 01:08:07,960
I'm not,

2946
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,250
I'm not sure about that part,

2947
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,690
but that's what I kind of guessing.

2948
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:11,440
Maybe it's a boat.

2949
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:11,800
Yeah.

2950
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,633
Well that's cool.

2951
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,320
They've got to write that country,

2952
01:08:14,321 --> 01:08:14,621
man.

2953
01:08:14,621 --> 01:08:15,470
They've got to figure it out.

2954
01:08:15,471 --> 01:08:16,480
They did with Columbia,

2955
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:17,540
they straightened Columbia.

2956
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:18,051
Columbia,

2957
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:19,490
apparently you can travel there now.

2958
01:08:19,491 --> 01:08:20,660
And it used to be,

2959
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:21,050
you know,

2960
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,390
back in the 80s when the
cocaine crisis was going on,

2961
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,800
Columbia was just ridiculous.

2962
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:25,230
You know,

2963
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:25,461
Metta,

2964
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:27,170
Ian was a Goddamn war zone,

2965
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,350
but now apparently you can go to Columbia
and like they've taken care of shit.

2966
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:31,184
They've cleaned it up.

2967
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,830
But I don't know if they're ever going
to be able to do that with Mexico.

2968
01:08:33,831 --> 01:08:34,370
It's just,

2969
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:36,380
it's so close to the supply.

2970
01:08:36,381 --> 01:08:36,831
You know,

2971
01:08:36,831 --> 01:08:37,040
the,

2972
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,440
the cash supply of America
is like right there.

2973
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:41,210
They can get the drugs and you know,

2974
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:44,870
get that shit across quickly and they're
doing crazy shit like rolling heads

2975
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:46,160
into disco techs and shit.

2976
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:48,220
You heard about that kill people enroll?

2977
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:48,470
Ha.

2978
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:49,850
I mean at what point do you go,

2979
01:08:49,851 --> 01:08:50,481
I killed them.

2980
01:08:50,481 --> 01:08:51,350
I cut off his head,

2981
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:51,740
rolled it.

2982
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,150
That's the role that a discotheque,

2983
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:55,100
the other thing I've been thinking of is,

2984
01:08:55,101 --> 01:08:57,460
I guess it Chapin is so
broke right now that,

2985
01:08:57,461 --> 01:09:00,020
that it's so cheap to
fly to Japan right now.

2986
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,960
They need people to come to
Japan because no one's going now.

2987
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,170
And so I heard that there's like flights
for like ridiculous amounts of money

2988
01:09:06,171 --> 01:09:06,621
from La,

2989
01:09:06,621 --> 01:09:09,230
like 300 bucks or something
like that just to go to Japan.

2990
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:09,590
Wow.

2991
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:10,010
And I'm like,

2992
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:11,450
now would you go to Tokyo?

2993
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:12,290
Would you do that?

2994
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,600
Or is it doesn't do anything about it.

2995
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:18,050
Read up on what the levels
are as far as radiation goes.

2996
01:09:18,051 --> 01:09:22,160
But the problem with Japan
and the radiation is that
I don't think they've been

2997
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:23,550
entirely honest about it.

2998
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:23,970
Yeah.

2999
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:25,700
I don't think they've been
honest about the leak.

3000
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,040
You know,

3001
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:26,570
there's,

3002
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:29,270
they're finding out that all
three of them are melt throughs.

3003
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:29,861
They're there,

3004
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:33,140
they're finding out all sorts of things
where it turns out that the actual

3005
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:34,460
damage done by these,

3006
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:34,910
you know,

3007
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:36,560
nuclear disasters is far,

3008
01:09:36,561 --> 01:09:38,760
far greater than what they
had initially forecast.

3009
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,800
And so who knows,

3010
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:42,080
like how far the spread
of the radiation goes.

3011
01:09:42,081 --> 01:09:43,640
I would have to hear about that.

3012
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:48,620
It'd be a fucking shame to go there for
$300 ticket and just fucking nuke for a

3013
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:49,100
bargain,

3014
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,060
get bigger balls.

3015
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:51,680
I would love to go to Japan though,

3016
01:09:51,681 --> 01:09:51,861
man.

3017
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:52,730
I've always wanted to go.

3018
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:54,740
I was always hoping that
we'd do a UFC in Japan.

3019
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:57,590
It's such an amazing piece of history.

3020
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:58,011
You know,

3021
01:09:58,011 --> 01:10:00,540
that one part of the
world is so unique there.

3022
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:04,640
There are innovations as far as martial
arts go and swordsmanship and literature

3023
01:10:04,641 --> 01:10:05,474
and you know,

3024
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,730
I mean that's where the book
of five rings came from.

3025
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,080
What the book of five rings is one of
my like guidebooks for life that me and

3026
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:14,000
Martin was hace book and that's,

3027
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:14,241
you know,

3028
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:15,620
all that Samurai way,

3029
01:10:15,621 --> 01:10:16,970
all that shit came from Japan.

3030
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:18,110
It's amazing culture.

3031
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:20,060
It does seem like a pretty crazy and they,

3032
01:10:20,061 --> 01:10:21,470
and it feels like after,

3033
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,330
I don't know how they
were before World War II,

3034
01:10:23,331 --> 01:10:26,660
but it feels like after World War II
they became more capitalistic than we are

3035
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:27,310
even,

3036
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:27,530
you know,

3037
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:29,630
like if you see like any
footage I've seen ever,

3038
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,464
it's like,

3039
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:33,170
you know like the neon lights and the,

3040
01:10:33,171 --> 01:10:34,070
and just like the,

3041
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:36,920
the amount of like the Japanese and
the products they love and you know,

3042
01:10:36,921 --> 01:10:37,191
it's just,

3043
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,110
I don't think there is
materialistic as us though.

3044
01:10:39,111 --> 01:10:41,000
I don't think they purchase
things and own things.

3045
01:10:41,001 --> 01:10:43,700
I don't think there's a lot of emphasis
in their culture of owning things.

3046
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,270
Okay.

3047
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:47,210
I think they spend all their money going
out to eat and spend all their money

3048
01:10:47,211 --> 01:10:50,750
drinking and spend makeup and different
and you notice also knows that a lot of

3049
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:52,490
them I have all have like eyelashes,

3050
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:55,040
fake eyelashes and they
spent so much money.

3051
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:57,223
Women,

3052
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,320
men started rock and
fake eyelashes as well,

3053
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:01,401
how to do it.

3054
01:11:01,401 --> 01:11:02,234
It's kind of,

3055
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:02,851
they kind of did,

3056
01:11:02,851 --> 01:11:04,520
they spend a lot more
money on how they look.

3057
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:06,080
Like I saw the other day.

3058
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,210
What did Americans,

3059
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:08,990
I saw the,

3060
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:10,460
at the saddle ranch I saw a group,

3061
01:11:10,461 --> 01:11:13,020
I'm like no step is research

3062
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:15,560
seven kids for sure.

3063
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,560
There were a few Asian pan.

3064
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:17,640
Well I had whatever,

3065
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,833
same shit.

3066
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,840
They all had their hair done
with like the brown in the debt,

3067
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:24,450
that blonde streaks in it and
they all had had like their,

3068
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,090
their genes that probably costs them $300.

3069
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:27,631
They do.

3070
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:28,090
They do.

3071
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:31,380
I've always said the Japanese seem
to be the most European of Asians.

3072
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,000
Like they're very much into like,

3073
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:34,531
like you said,

3074
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:35,364
it's kind of a diff,

3075
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:36,690
it seems like a different look.

3076
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:39,720
You know there are little
like hipper in their way.

3077
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:40,270
You know what I'm saying?

3078
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:42,270
Is it mixed with hairstylist?

3079
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,133
It's interesting.

3080
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:47,070
Interesting how many Japanese
people are into American culture.

3081
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:47,530
Oh yeah.

3082
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,230
How much they follow it and are really,

3083
01:11:49,231 --> 01:11:49,910
really,

3084
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:50,310
you know,

3085
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,340
enamored by Elvis.

3086
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:55,620
Michael Jackson was
like superman for them.

3087
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:56,700
It was crazy.

3088
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:56,911
Yeah.

3089
01:11:56,911 --> 01:11:58,020
It's a fascinating culture.

3090
01:11:58,021 --> 01:12:01,500
You know when they had all these problems
with the tsunamis in the earthquake

3091
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:02,334
and everything like that,

3092
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,110
and people would wait in line for a,

3093
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:05,490
for food and water and rations,

3094
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:07,080
they were orderly as fuck,

3095
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:07,690
man,

3096
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,240
they're culture is like so polite.

3097
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,220
They told me that they went to a bar or
something in Japan and people were lined

3098
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:19,221
up like at the bar as opposed to like
the idea of just come at the bazaar

3099
01:12:19,261 --> 01:12:19,950
mentality.

3100
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:20,310
Right.

3101
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:21,990
That's pretty crazy if
you think about that.

3102
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:22,790
Yeah.

3103
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:22,990
They're,

3104
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:24,360
they're much more disciplined,

3105
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,800
much more discipline and humble.

3106
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:26,820
Did you ever see Babel,

3107
01:12:26,821 --> 01:12:28,980
the movie babble babble.

3108
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:29,490
Now it is it.

3109
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:29,611
Oh,

3110
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:30,540
it's a great movie.

3111
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,220
Nri to the director.

3112
01:12:32,221 --> 01:12:33,510
Do you ever see I'm Otis Pedro's,

3113
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:34,680
you know what?

3114
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,040
No.

3115
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,570
With the dog fighting and all that,

3116
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:39,180
I bought on DVD and I
put it down somewhere.

3117
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,670
I have to get in the mood to
watch a movie with subtitles,

3118
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:43,150
but dude,

3119
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,130
he's intense.

3120
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:44,970
He's a great director.

3121
01:12:44,971 --> 01:12:45,710
He's done.

3122
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:46,200
He'd done a,

3123
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,130
I've seen a few of his movies.

3124
01:12:47,131 --> 01:12:47,520
I think he,

3125
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,950
I think he also did 21 grants.

3126
01:12:48,951 --> 01:12:49,350
I might be,

3127
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:50,131
I might be mistaken,

3128
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:51,360
but I think you're right.

3129
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:53,100
So he's got like the movies,

3130
01:12:53,101 --> 01:12:56,520
I've seen him do all have like two
or three stories and they all kind of

3131
01:12:56,521 --> 01:12:57,690
intertwined somehow.

3132
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,650
And this one Babel was amazing and
it had like three stories going on.

3133
01:13:01,651 --> 01:13:02,484
One of them was,

3134
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:02,911
uh,

3135
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:03,744
it's a,

3136
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:04,110
uh,

3137
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,040
Brad Pitt and um,

3138
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:07,380
and not Naomi Watts,

3139
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:07,680
but,

3140
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,310
but um,

3141
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:09,143
I forget her name.

3142
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,130
Anyway,

3143
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:10,801
they go to,

3144
01:13:10,801 --> 01:13:13,680
they go to Morocco and they're
visiting Morocco and uh,

3145
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,030
and some shit goes down and then,

3146
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:15,361
and then,

3147
01:13:15,361 --> 01:13:20,361
and then there's another story of a
Mexican family who's trying to get to a,

3148
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:20,961
a,

3149
01:13:20,961 --> 01:13:21,511
a wedding,

3150
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:22,710
I think across the board.

3151
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:24,060
And then they get into some trouble.

3152
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,490
And then there's a story
of this Japanese girl,

3153
01:13:26,491 --> 01:13:27,121
this is what I'm talking about.

3154
01:13:27,121 --> 01:13:27,381
The judge,

3155
01:13:27,381 --> 01:13:28,020
you have anything.

3156
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:28,831
It's so amazing.

3157
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,490
This girl,

3158
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:32,310
I think she should've won the Oscar
for best supporting actress that year.

3159
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:33,143
She plays a,

3160
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:37,450
she plays a deaf girl who's like just
depressed and living with her dad and this

3161
01:13:37,451 --> 01:13:37,890
stuff.

3162
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:40,110
And she's just as an actor,

3163
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:40,681
like,

3164
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:42,330
I don't know how you play deaf.

3165
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:43,830
And I don't know how
you'd do it that well,

3166
01:13:43,831 --> 01:13:45,030
like it's the most amazing thing.

3167
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:46,890
And what was really cool about it was,

3168
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,660
so this girl was like a party girl,

3169
01:13:48,661 --> 01:13:49,800
like having a good time with her friends,

3170
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:50,640
but she's depressed.

3171
01:13:50,641 --> 01:13:54,930
And what was this intense scene where
like they're out there partying.

3172
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:57,360
I think they do ecstasy or
something and they end up at a,

3173
01:13:57,361 --> 01:13:58,260
at a nightclub.

3174
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:03,030
And it's the coolest thing because
suddenly it goes from her perspective.

3175
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,160
Imagine that from a deaf
person's perspective,

3176
01:14:05,161 --> 01:14:05,821
a nightclub.

3177
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:06,311
So like,

3178
01:14:06,311 --> 01:14:06,820
it's like,

3179
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:08,190
it's like really loud,

3180
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:09,990
but she's not hearing the whole
thing is just kind of like,

3181
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:14,680
it's like muddled and she's kind of
looking around as the most intense shit.

3182
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,330
I'm kind of getting goosebumps
thinking you got to see it.

3183
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,051
What's it called again?

3184
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:18,040
It's called Babel B.

3185
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:18,221
A.

3186
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:18,421
B.

3187
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:18,561
E.

3188
01:14:18,561 --> 01:14:18,761
L.

3189
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:20,380
It has a great soundtrack too.

3190
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:21,191
And,

3191
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:22,024
and um,

3192
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:22,863
and,

3193
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,101
and this seen,

3194
01:14:24,101 --> 01:14:26,530
this girl killed it and
she ended up losing to,

3195
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:27,340
um,

3196
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:27,850
uh,

3197
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:28,241
Hudson.

3198
01:14:28,241 --> 01:14:30,320
Jennifer Hudson from a,

3199
01:14:30,321 --> 01:14:33,520
a dream dream girls was at
the movie and I saw her,

3200
01:14:33,521 --> 01:14:34,360
I saw some of that.

3201
01:14:34,361 --> 01:14:35,410
I didn't see the whole thing and that,

3202
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:37,930
but I think that she won
because it was like a popular,

3203
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:38,850
like she sang in that.

3204
01:14:38,851 --> 01:14:38,981
I mean,

3205
01:14:38,981 --> 01:14:40,150
I'm sure there's some good acting in it,

3206
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,270
but this girl just knocked it out like
as an actor to sit there and watch

3207
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:44,470
somebody kill it like that.

3208
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:45,520
You're like,

3209
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,353
Damn,

3210
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:46,871
you know?

3211
01:14:46,871 --> 01:14:47,320
And,

3212
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,700
but it was all Japan and it was,

3213
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:49,331
it was pretty cool.

3214
01:14:49,331 --> 01:14:49,841
It's a cool,

3215
01:14:49,841 --> 01:14:51,940
like kind of like a night in Japan.

3216
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:53,590
Kind of such an unusual culture,

3217
01:14:53,591 --> 01:14:54,040
man.

3218
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:54,873
Yeah.

3219
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:56,440
It's a really crazy place.

3220
01:14:56,441 --> 01:14:56,710
Yeah.

3221
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:59,170
They invented the suicide bombing too.

3222
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,630
They invented the advent of the kamikaze.

3223
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,101
We know what they did.

3224
01:15:03,101 --> 01:15:04,480
They got people on Crystal Meth.

3225
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:05,141
Really?

3226
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:05,351
Yeah.

3227
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:05,771
That's a,

3228
01:15:05,771 --> 01:15:07,510
that's how they got them
to do kamikaze work.

3229
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:12,280
Gave him crazy amphetamines and
made him just fucking do nutty shit.

3230
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:13,143
Crazy is that,

3231
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:13,991
you know,

3232
01:15:13,991 --> 01:15:15,610
what's interesting is
when you realize like,

3233
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:15,821
that's,

3234
01:15:15,821 --> 01:15:16,660
that's good to know.

3235
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:17,050
Like,

3236
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:20,140
like when you realize sometimes
the motivation behind some things,

3237
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:21,820
like my dad before he passed,

3238
01:15:21,821 --> 01:15:24,730
so he used to tell me that a
lot of the mullahs in Iran,

3239
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:25,600
um,

3240
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:25,841
they,

3241
01:15:25,841 --> 01:15:26,750
they're like a lot of people in,

3242
01:15:26,751 --> 01:15:27,610
you're on smoke opium,

3243
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:29,290
it's like smoking weed but it's opium.

3244
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,410
And he was saying that a lot of
these molars actually smoke opium.

3245
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:33,820
And I ended up doing a bit about,

3246
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:34,240
uh,

3247
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:34,511
you know,

3248
01:15:34,511 --> 01:15:37,570
staying up about how the reason these
guys are talking shit to America's cause

3249
01:15:37,571 --> 01:15:39,880
they're high and suddenly
started making sense.

3250
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,930
Like even like Kadafi supposedly
it's just high on all kinds of meds.

3251
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,870
And so you realize why the guys out
there talking like it's fucking Tony

3252
01:15:46,871 --> 01:15:47,530
Montana.

3253
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:48,700
I don't know if you've
seen some of the quotes,

3254
01:15:48,701 --> 01:15:49,001
but he's like,

3255
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:50,080
I'm gonna fight to the death.

3256
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:51,783
So you know,

3257
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,990
somebody might give them like,

3258
01:15:52,991 --> 01:15:53,741
credit is like,

3259
01:15:53,741 --> 01:15:55,570
I mean his followers would
be like kipp credit for like,

3260
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:55,721
oh,

3261
01:15:55,721 --> 01:15:56,511
this guy's got balls,

3262
01:15:56,511 --> 01:15:57,580
he's stand up to America.

3263
01:15:57,730 --> 01:15:58,061
But no,

3264
01:15:58,061 --> 01:15:59,200
the guy's fucking high.

3265
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:00,790
And he's just talking shit.

3266
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,130
And the same thing with
these guys that are kamikaze.

3267
01:16:03,131 --> 01:16:03,431
You know,

3268
01:16:03,431 --> 01:16:03,730
it was like,

3269
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:04,121
Oh wow,

3270
01:16:04,121 --> 01:16:05,140
there's a lot of balls to do that.

3271
01:16:05,141 --> 01:16:05,291
Yeah.

3272
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:06,370
If you're fucking high on meth.

3273
01:16:06,371 --> 01:16:06,671
He like,

3274
01:16:06,671 --> 01:16:06,851
yeah,

3275
01:16:06,851 --> 01:16:10,810
I think I'm about to fucking take on
this fucking boat with my little plane.

3276
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:12,790
I just saw a movie,

3277
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:12,971
guys.

3278
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:14,290
Remember that movie airport?

3279
01:16:14,291 --> 01:16:17,530
It was big in the seventies
I was kind of a report.

3280
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:17,831
Yeah.

3281
01:16:17,831 --> 01:16:20,440
It was about a terrorism
act that this guy,

3282
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:21,910
this guy lost his job.

3283
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:25,520
The economy was shit and he
was going to kill himself to,

3284
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:26,980
to collect on insurance.

3285
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:31,320
And so he went on this plane and it was
kind of cool to see like how planes he

3286
01:16:31,321 --> 01:16:31,721
used to be,

3287
01:16:31,721 --> 01:16:32,830
where people are smoking,

3288
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:33,730
you know,

3289
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:33,831
and,

3290
01:16:33,831 --> 01:16:34,664
and all this crap.

3291
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:40,020
And then he blew up a bomb on the plane
and it was so funny seeing how na Aa,

3292
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,600
how we used to think if a
bomb blew up on a plane,

3293
01:16:43,601 --> 01:16:46,560
like how this little hole came out
and the wind blew around the little,

3294
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:46,781
it's like,

3295
01:16:46,781 --> 01:16:47,021
oh,

3296
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:48,100
it's windy in here.

3297
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:48,934
You know,

3298
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:53,080
like the plane's not special effects
in the ground or anything like that,

3299
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:53,451
but do,

3300
01:16:53,451 --> 01:16:56,150
it was also weird just seeing
like how the airports are cured.

3301
01:16:56,151 --> 01:16:58,750
He used to be how like how the movies,

3302
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:01,990
like this one was a movie about a
terrorist blowing up a bomb in 19,

3303
01:17:01,991 --> 01:17:02,390
whatever,

3304
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:04,450
79 or [inaudible] 72 or something.

3305
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:05,830
I think it was even earlier than that,

3306
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:07,840
but they made a four movies about it.

3307
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:08,590
I don't know if you guys ever

3308
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:08,740
was,

3309
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:09,050
it was,

3310
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:11,570
this was actually an actual thing that
happened and it was based on a true

3311
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:11,871
story.

3312
01:17:11,871 --> 01:17:12,170
There's no,

3313
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:12,320
no,

3314
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:12,471
no,

3315
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:13,560
this is just like the,

3316
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:13,940
the,

3317
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:18,940
their take of terrorism back in the 70s
and like bombs and blowing up the planes

3318
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,920
or interest terror in 1970 it was,

3319
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,810
there was some terrorism back then,

3320
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,320

3321
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,190
I mean there had been,

3322
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:25,700

3323
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:26,030
that,

3324
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:28,780
that event that happened
at the Olympics Olympics.

3325
01:17:28,781 --> 01:17:29,000
Yeah.

3326
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,720

[inaudible] 72 [inaudible] 72 Olympics.

3328
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:32,930
I mean,

3329
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:34,280
we've had terrorism forever.

3330
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:34,820
Oh yeah.

3331
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:35,480
Oh yeah.

3332
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:35,631
Well,

3333
01:17:35,631 --> 01:17:39,380
they say even like if you go back to
like the whole Jewish Palestinian thing,

3334
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,700
like before,

3335
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:43,100
before Israel became a state,

3336
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:47,210
the Jews were doing terrorist
acts to try and get,

3337
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:48,230
you know,

3338
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:48,411

3339
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:48,681
to,

3340
01:17:48,681 --> 01:17:50,210
to get more locks.

3341
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:50,600
Yeah.

3342
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,351
You get more locks.

3343
01:17:51,351 --> 01:17:52,184
Yeah.

3344
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:53,660
No,

3345
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,710
I mean it always,

3346
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:55,480

3347
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,520
an oppressed people are always doing
the terrorist shellacked you know.

3348
01:17:58,660 --> 01:17:59,120
Um,

3349
01:17:59,120 --> 01:17:59,361
but,

3350
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:00,194
um,

3351
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:00,681
but no,

3352
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:01,221
but that,

3353
01:18:01,221 --> 01:18:01,491
that,

3354
01:18:01,491 --> 01:18:01,670
uh,

3355
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:02,120
uh,

3356
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:02,380
the,

3357
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:03,210
the thing with the,

3358
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:03,770
with the,

3359
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:06,050
with what you talking about
air travel and stuff now,

3360
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,310
even now when you travel,

3361
01:18:07,311 --> 01:18:09,350
when you go to different
parts of the world,

3362
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:13,130
it's amazing to see their take on
terrorism and there take through like the

3363
01:18:13,131 --> 01:18:13,611
airport,

3364
01:18:13,611 --> 01:18:14,360
like say like,

3365
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:14,511
well,

3366
01:18:14,511 --> 01:18:14,991
I've just seen,

3367
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:15,111
like,

3368
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:15,411
I've been,

3369
01:18:15,411 --> 01:18:15,621
like,

3370
01:18:15,621 --> 01:18:18,380
I've been to airports now sometimes in
the Middle East where the dude's like

3371
01:18:18,381 --> 01:18:19,214
straight up.

3372
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:19,870
Like,

3373
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:21,530
like he's talking on his phone as you're,

3374
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:21,771
like,

3375
01:18:21,771 --> 01:18:23,870
the Tsa guy is on an earpiece,

3376
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:24,920
talking on a phone,

3377
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:25,871
just like it.

3378
01:18:25,871 --> 01:18:26,241
Go ahead.

3379
01:18:26,241 --> 01:18:27,051
And I was joking,

3380
01:18:27,051 --> 01:18:27,381
I was like,

3381
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:27,771
he's like,

3382
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:28,131
go ahead.

3383
01:18:28,131 --> 01:18:28,431
You know,

3384
01:18:28,431 --> 01:18:29,000
you,

3385
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:29,450
you know,

3386
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:30,470
you can go because,

3387
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:30,741
you know,

3388
01:18:30,741 --> 01:18:31,131
because,

3389
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:31,380
you know,

3390
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:31,850
we're,

3391
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:32,631
we're all terrorists.

3392
01:18:32,631 --> 01:18:32,751
Like,

3393
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:33,370
you know,

3394
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:35,330
that that was my take of it jokingly.

3395
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,820
But like I've had that,

3396
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:38,390
you know,

3397
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:38,750
I've had,

3398
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:40,880
I've had dudes like on the
phone not paying attention.

3399
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:41,070
I had,

3400
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:43,730
I saw one TSA dude literally like he was,

3401
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:44,833
he was kind of,

3402
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:45,853
um,

3403
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:46,400
he,

3404
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,110
he kinda like moved out of the way.

3405
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:48,800
Uh,

3406
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,320
and he was checking out chicks
acids as they would walk by.

3407
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,210
That's where his mind was.

3408
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,290
Um,

3409
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:56,140
in Australia you do a,

3410
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:56,661
in Australia,

3411
01:18:56,661 --> 01:18:56,831
like,

3412
01:18:56,831 --> 01:18:57,780
and I've done this like,

3413
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:58,701
again,

3414
01:18:58,701 --> 01:19:02,210
like on domestic flights you can
take liquids on and I don't know,

3415
01:19:02,211 --> 01:19:02,881
I don't know what to do.

3416
01:19:02,881 --> 01:19:04,550
Like I was about to throw the
water away and the guy was like,

3417
01:19:04,551 --> 01:19:04,791
no,

3418
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:05,780
bring it on is so raw.

3419
01:19:05,781 --> 01:19:06,290
And I'm like,

3420
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:07,280
that's kind of weird man.

3421
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:09,210
Some places they don't make
you take your sneakers off.

3422
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:09,690
Yeah.

3423
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:09,871
It's,

3424
01:19:09,871 --> 01:19:10,431
this is weird.

3425
01:19:10,431 --> 01:19:11,001
Different places,

3426
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:11,990
different takes on it.

3427
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,280
The whole thing's ridiculous.

3428
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,091
Or like,

3429
01:19:14,091 --> 01:19:14,391
or like,

3430
01:19:14,391 --> 01:19:14,691
I'm sorry,

3431
01:19:14,691 --> 01:19:15,291
Atlanta when I,

3432
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:15,660

3433
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:16,461

my wife was studying is southwest man.

3435
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:18,890
She was studying more area,

3436
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:21,200
which is like known to be like a drug,

3437
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:21,680
uh,

3438
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,150
like drug slash like,

3439
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:23,781

3440
01:19:23,781 --> 01:19:24,200
um,

3441
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:24,590
uh,

3442
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:25,071
mafia,

3443
01:19:25,071 --> 01:19:26,330
all these like Russian mob.

3444
01:19:26,331 --> 01:19:29,270
Anyone who's doing some
illegal shit goes to Marbella.

3445
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,030
And when I landed at the airport like,

3446
01:19:32,031 --> 01:19:33,170
you know how like usually there's like,

3447
01:19:33,171 --> 01:19:33,381
you know,

3448
01:19:33,381 --> 01:19:34,610
customs this and that.

3449
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:36,450
There is no like you could just,

3450
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:36,891
I was like,

3451
01:19:36,891 --> 01:19:39,410
I could have like a bag
filled with heroin right now.

3452
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:40,281
And they were like,

3453
01:19:40,281 --> 01:19:41,150
come on in man.

3454
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,340
So it's known for being like an illegal,

3455
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:43,581
yeah,

3456
01:19:43,581 --> 01:19:44,840
if you go down there zone,

3457
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,291
I'll tell you,

3458
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:45,510
I,

3459
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:47,270
I realized like I was
walking on the beach.

3460
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:47,871
It's beautiful.

3461
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:51,740
I was walking on the little
boardwalk and I saw this like big,

3462
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,521
you know how Russian,

3463
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:53,630
some Russian dudes are just like,

3464
01:19:53,631 --> 01:19:54,464
they're big.

3465
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,461
This guy was big.

3466
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:57,500
He had like the short
kind of short shorts,

3467
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:58,670
no shirt on,

3468
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:01,850
like black socks all the way
up to the knee on a cell phone,

3469
01:20:01,851 --> 01:20:03,380
just walking like with a gold chain.

3470
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:03,970
I'm like that dude,

3471
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:04,731
the Russian mob,

3472
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:04,881
like,

3473
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:05,714
come on man.

3474
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,590
I was like Tony Soprano
going out for a walk.

3475
01:20:07,591 --> 01:20:08,150
You know

3476
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:10,850
Russian mobs way scarier to
me than the Italian Mama.

3477
01:20:10,851 --> 01:20:11,450
Hell yeah.

3478
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:15,980
Italian mom was so much ego and flashiness
and like all this shit that John

3479
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:16,520
Gotti did.

3480
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,360
You know everybody like
thought of John God.

3481
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:18,621
He's like,

3482
01:20:18,621 --> 01:20:18,861
wow,

3483
01:20:18,861 --> 01:20:20,420
this is like the ultimate gangster.

3484
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:20,781
No,

3485
01:20:20,781 --> 01:20:22,580
this is the ultimate thing
you're not supposed to do.

3486
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:26,240
You're not supposed to like be on TV where
everybody knows who the fuck you are.

3487
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:30,350
You're not supposed to like be so
blatant about it all when fucking $15,000

3488
01:20:30,351 --> 01:20:34,670
suits and having people knocked off
in front of steak houses like this is

3489
01:20:34,671 --> 01:20:35,331
ridiculous.

3490
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:36,590
You guys are going to
ruin the whole thing.

3491
01:20:36,591 --> 01:20:38,240
And it did wind up
ruining the whole thing.

3492
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:39,710
Whereas the Russian mobsters,

3493
01:20:39,711 --> 01:20:42,710
when was the last time a Russian
mobster got clipped was on TV.

3494
01:20:42,711 --> 01:20:43,221
There's no rush.

3495
01:20:43,221 --> 01:20:43,821
And John,

3496
01:20:43,821 --> 01:20:44,091
God,

3497
01:20:44,091 --> 01:20:44,924
he's there are,

3498
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:46,580
but you're never going to
fucking hear about them.

3499
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:47,791
Well,

3500
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:49,250
the thing about the Russians too is like,

3501
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:50,071
again,

3502
01:20:50,071 --> 01:20:51,780
I talk about this on stage
and it's total truth.

3503
01:20:51,781 --> 01:20:54,960
It's like they like if you watch any time,

3504
01:20:54,961 --> 01:20:56,070
like there's something going on,

3505
01:20:56,071 --> 01:20:56,371
like there's,

3506
01:20:56,371 --> 01:20:58,350
I would say like whenever
there's a hostage situation,

3507
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,150
like these guys are so bad ass,

3508
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:03,360
they shut with a military shows
up and they just kill everybody.

3509
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:03,990
They're not,

3510
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:04,411
they're like,

3511
01:21:04,411 --> 01:21:04,531
yeah,

3512
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:05,460
we might save some,

3513
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:06,600
we might say some hostages,

3514
01:21:06,601 --> 01:21:07,470
but they'll probably die.

3515
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:10,420
We're going to kick
kill the hostage takers,

3516
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:11,071
kill the hostage.

3517
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:11,821
We might kill each other.

3518
01:21:11,821 --> 01:21:12,870
There's still bad ass.

3519
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:14,130
And that's why I'm serious.

3520
01:21:14,131 --> 01:21:15,840
It's like the biggest mobsters and Russia.

3521
01:21:15,841 --> 01:21:17,340
It's like Vladimir Putin is like,

3522
01:21:17,341 --> 01:21:17,881
Ma these,

3523
01:21:17,881 --> 01:21:18,714
the leader,

3524
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:19,650
he,

3525
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,011
when he,

3526
01:21:20,011 --> 01:21:21,360
when he left his prime minister,

3527
01:21:21,361 --> 01:21:21,960
he made the night.

3528
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,070
You'd made the other guy,

3529
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:24,050
what's his name?

3530
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:24,640
Um,

3531
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:25,000
uh,

3532
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,801
I got his name,

3533
01:21:25,801 --> 01:21:26,611
just slipped my mind right now.

3534
01:21:26,611 --> 01:21:27,690
But he brought,

3535
01:21:27,691 --> 01:21:31,350
the other guy is the president and
then he just became prime minister.

3536
01:21:31,351 --> 01:21:33,360
It's like when you pull shit like that,

3537
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:34,141
it's like,

3538
01:21:34,141 --> 01:21:35,070
all right this dude,

3539
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:35,910
it's gangster shit.

3540
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:36,900
It's gangster shit.

3541
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:38,790
And he's a med Memphian Judy.

3542
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:41,260
Yeah in VF and he's a black belt in judo,

3543
01:21:41,261 --> 01:21:43,510
like a legit blackbelt still trains,

3544
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,291
flips,

3545
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:45,580
people do the fucking air.

3546
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,370
So he like lets everybody like
Obama and like bitch I'll kill you.

3547
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:49,350
And you see it in the eye.

3548
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:50,540
It's like when you watch like what,

3549
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:51,180
I'm sorry,

3550
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:51,700
I again,

3551
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,350
I saw the press conference is,

3552
01:21:53,351 --> 01:21:55,530
it was the contrast if
you can like youtube,

3553
01:21:55,531 --> 01:21:56,364
it maybe like there's a,

3554
01:21:56,510 --> 01:22:00,090
like after September 11th there's a press
conference with Bush and Putin and you

3555
01:22:00,091 --> 01:22:01,770
know like Bush was like with a speech,

3556
01:22:01,771 --> 01:22:04,890
you know with us or against the smoke
them out of the whole whole who who,

3557
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,140
you know and Putin was
just straight up like,

3558
01:22:07,141 --> 01:22:07,681
what are you guys going to do?

3559
01:22:07,681 --> 01:22:07,861
He's like,

3560
01:22:07,861 --> 01:22:08,694
we're going to kill them.

3561
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,800
Like who is like anyone wear turban,

3562
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:11,251
we kill,

3563
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:11,491
you know,

3564
01:22:11,491 --> 01:22:13,380
and it's like you see it in his eyes.

3565
01:22:13,381 --> 01:22:13,950
Like he's like,

3566
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:14,790
he's thinking like,

3567
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:15,270
okay,

3568
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:16,660
I will say what I need to save,

3569
01:22:16,661 --> 01:22:19,050
but afterwards some
dying is going to happen.

3570
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:19,861
Apparently,

3571
01:22:19,861 --> 01:22:20,191
you know,

3572
01:22:20,191 --> 01:22:25,191
Bush and Putin had a meeting and a Bush
was so offensively ignorant that Putin

3573
01:22:25,621 --> 01:22:29,460
like immediately started changing the
way he negotiates and deals with America

3574
01:22:29,461 --> 01:22:29,941
afterwards.

3575
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:32,430
Like just didn't respect
what Bush had to say,

3576
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,550
which was like giving him advice
about things and he's like,

3577
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:36,120
[inaudible],

3578
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,530
who the fuck are you talking to?

3579
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:38,060
Man?

3580
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,670
I'm flattered me or Putin pitch,

3581
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:40,140
hey,

3582
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:45,030
you're just a son of some fucking CIA
age is to be the puppet and charge.

3583
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:45,390
Like,

3584
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:46,800
I'm really running shit.

3585
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:47,790
Russia.

3586
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:50,580
That's the difference between
like the president of America,

3587
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:54,000
the president of America is like some
sort of a fucking figurehead for giant

3588
01:22:54,001 --> 01:22:54,834
corporations.

3589
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,680
The guy who's running Russia
is really running Russia.

3590
01:22:58,150 --> 01:22:58,983
Yeah,

3591
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:00,290
absolutely man.

3592
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,461
Pretty bad ass.

3593
01:23:01,461 --> 01:23:01,680
You know,

3594
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:02,451
I always say like,

3595
01:23:02,451 --> 01:23:03,680
I don't fuck with Russia's man.

3596
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:04,791
That's a tough,

3597
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:05,800
tough up there,

3598
01:23:05,801 --> 01:23:06,130
man.

3599
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:06,520
Yeah.

3600
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,560
You know that fucking story.

3601
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:10,480
Aw skull where fade or a million inco.

3602
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,940
The former heavyweight
pride champion came from,

3603
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:15,430
I never watched documentaries
on that kind of that life.

3604
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:15,581
You know,

3605
01:23:15,581 --> 01:23:17,650
you'll like look at him up
there and that mining town,

3606
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,960
you're saying shit freezing.

3607
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:21,010
Fucking cold.

3608
01:23:21,011 --> 01:23:23,560
It's like hours away
from Saint Petersburg,

3609
01:23:23,561 --> 01:23:28,561
Russia by train the fuck are you
doing out some hardy ass people?

3610
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:29,260
Yeah,

3611
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:29,501
man.

3612
01:23:29,501 --> 01:23:30,334
That'll fuck around.

3613
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:32,020
You know they have wolf problems up there.

3614
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:32,913
I'll do that.

3615
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:33,290
Yeah.

3616
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:37,720
They're having giant packs of super
wolves that are banding together for the

3617
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:41,230
first time and killing livestock
because it's so fucking cold.

3618
01:23:41,231 --> 01:23:42,040
It's winter.

3619
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:46,900
It got so cold up there that many packs
of wolves joined together to become one

3620
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:48,610
giant pack because they're,

3621
01:23:48,611 --> 01:23:49,070
they're the,

3622
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:52,300
they're the freezing temperatures were
killing all of their game and they were

3623
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:53,051
getting desperate.

3624
01:23:53,051 --> 01:23:56,950
So they form some sort of a new strategy
and we'd go into fucking towns and just

3625
01:23:56,951 --> 01:23:57,784
jack all their,

3626
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,370
all their livestock who that's
gotta be the worst way to go.

3627
01:24:00,371 --> 01:24:01,240
Can you imagine if you like

3628
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:02,860
walking home with a
girlfriend or you know,

3629
01:24:02,861 --> 01:24:04,630
wife after like dinner
one night and you're like,

3630
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:05,880
oh that was great dinner and then you,

3631
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:07,880
you look back,

3632
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:11,510
you're like as a pack of fucking
wolves are terrifying to him.

3633
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:11,930
Like,

3634
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:13,620
cause we've killed them
off in this country.

3635
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,130
And then we started restocking.

3636
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:15,421
I'm like,

3637
01:24:15,421 --> 01:24:17,100
they're having a problem
right now in Idaho.

3638
01:24:17,101 --> 01:24:18,780
I believe it is because a,

3639
01:24:18,781 --> 01:24:20,340
they've stocked the uh,

3640
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:25,050
the giant gray wolf from Canada and they
brought it into Idaho to try to like

3641
01:24:25,051 --> 01:24:25,471
bring,

3642
01:24:25,471 --> 01:24:26,590
bring the population's up.

3643
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,070
But now the populations are out of the,

3644
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:30,710
out of control and they're in like
the several thousands and then another

3645
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,880
killing livestock and fucking things up.

3646
01:24:32,881 --> 01:24:35,340
And you have to worry about them with
people too because they're big animals

3647
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,100
only 180 pounds and they will kill people.

3648
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:41,820
Like all that big bad wolf shit and
Little Red Riding Hood Shit where it was

3649
01:24:41,821 --> 01:24:42,654
always wolves.

3650
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,190
That's because wolves used to kill people.

3651
01:24:44,191 --> 01:24:44,580
Yeah,

3652
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:45,030
yeah.

3653
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:48,710
Before we figured out tanks
and jets and guns and you know,

3654
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:50,280
there was like there was a real issue.

3655
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:50,611
Yeah,

3656
01:24:50,611 --> 01:24:51,960
you don't want to fuck with a wolf man,

3657
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:53,730
don't fuck with him.

3658
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:55,330
That's why there,

3659
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:59,100
there was a great documentary on
Yellowstone and the cycle of life and

3660
01:24:59,101 --> 01:25:01,860
Yellowstone and one of the things that
talked about is how the wolves got

3661
01:25:01,861 --> 01:25:05,130
stronger over the winter and all
these other animals got fucked.

3662
01:25:05,370 --> 01:25:06,210
All these other animals,

3663
01:25:06,211 --> 01:25:07,800
like they couldn't find their vegetation.

3664
01:25:07,801 --> 01:25:10,980
They had digging through all this snow
to get to their plants and the wolves

3665
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:14,490
were just eating all these deer so they
would be well fed and they would be

3666
01:25:14,491 --> 01:25:15,091
stronger.

3667
01:25:15,091 --> 01:25:16,110
And the livestock,

3668
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:16,681
the Caribou,

3669
01:25:16,681 --> 01:25:17,370
the deers,

3670
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:20,790
they would all slowly start to the weekend
and they would all just get taken out

3671
01:25:20,791 --> 01:25:22,950
by wolves as fascinating to watch,

3672
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:23,823
man.

3673
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:24,841
Two thoughts came to mind.

3674
01:25:24,841 --> 01:25:25,351
One was,

3675
01:25:25,351 --> 01:25:26,880
I remember as a kid in Iran,

3676
01:25:26,881 --> 01:25:27,391
in Tehran,

3677
01:25:27,391 --> 01:25:27,780
I was,

3678
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:30,240
I left when I was six and
I remember my dad was like,

3679
01:25:30,241 --> 01:25:30,961
my dad was,

3680
01:25:30,961 --> 01:25:32,520
was like a manly man.

3681
01:25:32,521 --> 01:25:32,701
Like,

3682
01:25:32,701 --> 01:25:33,241
he's just like,

3683
01:25:33,241 --> 01:25:33,590
you know,

3684
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:33,780
like,

3685
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:35,870
and he was and he was a self
made millionaire neuron.

3686
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,350
So like he was like back then,

3687
01:25:37,351 --> 01:25:38,310
like he was like the Godfather,

3688
01:25:38,311 --> 01:25:39,690
like the shitty would do for people.

3689
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:40,980
He was like the Godfather,

3690
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,900
like straight up like don Corleone,

3691
01:25:42,901 --> 01:25:43,621
like come to him,

3692
01:25:43,621 --> 01:25:44,460
whatever you need done.

3693
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,220
But he and all his friends
were like wrestlers and shit.

3694
01:25:47,221 --> 01:25:47,400
Like,

3695
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:48,510
like tough dudes.

3696
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:50,550
A lot of wrestlers out of
round rod are wrestlers.

3697
01:25:50,551 --> 01:25:50,791
Yeah.

3698
01:25:50,791 --> 01:25:53,080
And then my dad was a big drinker
because he was from northern,

3699
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:53,821
northern Iran.

3700
01:25:53,821 --> 01:25:55,560
Tabriz was it near the border of Russia?

3701
01:25:55,561 --> 01:25:57,000
So vodka was like water,

3702
01:25:57,001 --> 01:25:58,140
like they would drink it all the time.

3703
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:00,330
So I just have this memory of my dad.

3704
01:26:00,331 --> 01:26:01,470
We were coming home from a party,

3705
01:26:01,471 --> 01:26:02,550
he was obviously drunk,

3706
01:26:02,551 --> 01:26:07,370
he was us home and there was a pack of
wild dogs like down the block from where

3707
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:08,150
we live.

3708
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:09,650
And my dad was so crazy,

3709
01:26:09,651 --> 01:26:10,010
like,

3710
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:10,880
like manly.

3711
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:14,750
He pulled the car over and picked up a
couple of rocks and started chasing the

3712
01:26:14,751 --> 01:26:15,584
pack of dog.

3713
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,370
I'm coming here,

3714
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:19,881
I'm like,

3715
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:20,631
what family?

3716
01:26:20,631 --> 01:26:23,300
And the guard is throwing rocks
at wild and I'm sitting there,

3717
01:26:23,301 --> 01:26:24,620
I'm sitting there as a kid going like,

3718
01:26:24,621 --> 01:26:24,921
Damn,

3719
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:26,480
my dad is as bad as you know,

3720
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:27,531
when you grow up you're like,

3721
01:26:27,531 --> 01:26:28,011
no man,

3722
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:29,620
my dad was good the fuck.

3723
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:31,930
But Iranians are famous for their,

3724
01:26:31,931 --> 01:26:33,200
for their physical conditioning.

3725
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:38,240
There's like a lot of techniques that
they used from Iran that are still used

3726
01:26:38,581 --> 01:26:39,031
today,

3727
01:26:39,031 --> 01:26:41,570
like physical conditioning
and certain like a,

3728
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:46,580
the shield cast and a couple of fitness
moves and the wrestlers from Iran where

3729
01:26:47,461 --> 01:26:50,640
are known like internationally for being
some of the toughest wrestlers in the

3730
01:26:50,641 --> 01:26:51,120
world,

3731
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:54,180
especially when you consider that
Iran is not a very large country but

3732
01:26:54,181 --> 01:26:58,350
consistently produced his top 10 w
worldclass wrestlers like every year.

3733
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:58,611
Yeah,

3734
01:26:58,611 --> 01:26:58,711
yeah,

3735
01:26:58,711 --> 01:26:59,101
definitely.

3736
01:26:59,101 --> 01:27:01,230
Wrestling is one of our
big sports there and it's,

3737
01:27:01,231 --> 01:27:01,651
and it's,

3738
01:27:01,651 --> 01:27:01,861
uh,

3739
01:27:01,861 --> 01:27:02,221
it was,

3740
01:27:02,221 --> 01:27:04,560
it's a huge thing like chic bitch.

3741
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:08,660
I seek baby recognize he was a
legit wrestler at one point in time,

3742
01:27:08,661 --> 01:27:08,950
you know?

3743
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:09,320
Yeah,

3744
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:09,960
yeah.

3745
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,160
There's wrestling and weightlifting.

3746
01:27:11,161 --> 01:27:12,630
Weightlifting too is another one.

3747
01:27:12,631 --> 01:27:13,770
Like Iranians always compete.

3748
01:27:13,771 --> 01:27:14,431
It's kind of weird.

3749
01:27:14,431 --> 01:27:15,300
It's to manly country.

3750
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:15,720
Yeah.

3751
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:16,553
Mainly countries.

3752
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:17,101
But it's funny,

3753
01:27:17,101 --> 01:27:19,530
the other thought that came to mind with
the walls when you talk about the wars

3754
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:20,280
is having a kid.

3755
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:20,971
I'm sure you've seen it.

3756
01:27:20,971 --> 01:27:21,660
It's like,

3757
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:25,500
it's funny how these these
children's books and like,

3758
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:26,280
you know,

3759
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,150
obviously you know,

3760
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:27,421
big,

3761
01:27:27,421 --> 01:27:27,841
bad wolf,

3762
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:29,010
but like once in a while there'll be like,

3763
01:27:29,011 --> 01:27:29,844
you know,

3764
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:33,180
this such as like the cute little wolf
or the cute little like some animals that

3765
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:33,481
like,

3766
01:27:33,481 --> 01:27:33,661
you know,

3767
01:27:33,661 --> 01:27:34,050
the hippo,

3768
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:34,290
my,

3769
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:35,400
my son loves hippos.

3770
01:27:35,401 --> 01:27:37,560
He was talking about like hippos
and no for the most deaths in,

3771
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:38,731
but my son is like,

3772
01:27:38,731 --> 01:27:38,881
I,

3773
01:27:38,881 --> 01:27:39,360
you know,

3774
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:39,740
HIPPA,

3775
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:40,151

3776
01:27:40,151 --> 01:27:43,650
her and like they're so cute
and the polar bears is coke.

3777
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:44,131
Oh yeah,

3778
01:27:44,131 --> 01:27:44,830
exactly.

3779
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:45,663
Cola.

3780
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:46,810
Yeah,

3781
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:47,100
yeah.

3782
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:47,730
Monsters.

3783
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:48,090
Yeah.

3784
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:48,810
It's crazy.

3785
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:49,561
Fucking evil.

3786
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:49,990
Cons.

3787
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:50,341
Yeah.

3788
01:27:50,341 --> 01:27:50,600
Yeah.

3789
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,241
It's funny,

3790
01:27:51,241 --> 01:27:52,110
like you could do like a,

3791
01:27:52,111 --> 01:27:53,130
you could do like a spoof,

3792
01:27:53,131 --> 01:27:53,851
like a behind,

3793
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:54,660
like a,

3794
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:55,950
like a behind the scenes.

3795
01:27:55,951 --> 01:27:59,070
You know how like some actors that
are like so lovable end up being such

3796
01:27:59,071 --> 01:27:59,904
assholes.

3797
01:28:00,050 --> 01:28:00,370
Yeah,

3798
01:28:00,370 --> 01:28:01,200
exactly.

3799
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,033
Exactly.

3800
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:03,310
That's hilarious.

3801
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:03,850
Yeah.

3802
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:07,390
Like the fucking does star baseball
player who tells a kid to go fuck himself

3803
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:10,430
the fuck Mr. Yeah.

3804
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:11,540
You're my hero.

3805
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:12,650
Fucking,

3806
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:13,870
you know I love hippo.

3807
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:17,440
Fuck you fucking bite in your car.

3808
01:28:17,441 --> 01:28:18,140
Tires off.

3809
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:18,973
Hilarious.

3810
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:24,210
There's a great picture online of this
African guy running from a hippo and it's

3811
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:24,491
a,

3812
01:28:24,491 --> 01:28:26,890
it's a funny picture and
a terrifying picture.

3813
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,380
It's funny because the guy made it,

3814
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:28,991
he survived.

3815
01:28:28,991 --> 01:28:29,950
He got away from the hippo.

3816
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,380
But it's fucking terrifying
when you watching it man.

3817
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:37,300
Cause this guy is running in which
essentially a gigantic wild pig.

3818
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:38,291
It's what they are.

3819
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:39,670
There are different kind of pig.

3820
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:40,930
They're in the family of pigs.

3821
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:42,820
Pigs are ruthless assholes,

3822
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,421
you know.

3823
01:28:43,421 --> 01:28:47,680
And this giant wild pig is chasing this
guy down the street and it's fucking

3824
01:28:47,681 --> 01:28:48,410
terrifying.

3825
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:49,250
Could you imagine a thought,

3826
01:28:49,251 --> 01:28:51,350
like one of my thoughts
at that point would be,

3827
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:53,053
are they like,

3828
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:54,740
are they supposed to run faster?

3829
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:56,060
Learning to think about,

3830
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:57,281
do you know what I'm saying?

3831
01:28:57,281 --> 01:29:00,080
Like have I ever heard of a news
piece about these guys here?

3832
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:00,760
Like you know,

3833
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,220
the only that keeps you safe

3834
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,750
is that they can't run too far.

3835
01:29:03,751 --> 01:29:04,770
Cause they're so big,

3836
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,260
they're so big in the Karen,

3837
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:07,081
so much mass in.

3838
01:29:07,081 --> 01:29:08,100
A lot of times they spend,

3839
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:09,660
they spend a lot of
their time in the water.

3840
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:10,351
They could run,

3841
01:29:10,351 --> 01:29:11,520
but it's not their best move.

3842
01:29:11,521 --> 01:29:12,510
You've got to outdistance them,

3843
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:13,770
but this guy was running fast.

3844
01:29:13,771 --> 01:29:15,330
This thing looked like it
was like right on his ass.

3845
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:18,630
One of the beautiful things about this
podcast is that we have this message

3846
01:29:18,631 --> 01:29:22,260
board@joerogan.net and whenever we bring
up something like this in the podcast,

3847
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:25,560
there's a thread that's already dedicated
to the Mazda Bonnie podcasts that

3848
01:29:25,561 --> 01:29:26,060
hilarious.

3849
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:26,581
What is his name?

3850
01:29:26,581 --> 01:29:27,300
Mr Dennison.

3851
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,133
He puts it up.

3852
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:29,940
I should give the guy credit
because he puts it up.

3853
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:30,480
Yes,

3854
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,320
Mr Dennison.

3855
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,160
Cool motherfucker.

3856
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,993
He's always doing this,

3857
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,260
but I know somewhere on this
thread someone's going to
put that picture of that

3858
01:29:37,261 --> 01:29:37,891
hippo chasing.

3859
01:29:37,891 --> 01:29:39,480
That guy is a beautiful thing.

3860
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:41,310
The Internet's a beautiful
thing in that respect.

3861
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,040
Yeah.

3862
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:42,290
You know,

3863
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:44,010
you said that picture that Tom,

3864
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:44,731
when African stuff,

3865
01:29:44,731 --> 01:29:45,600
have you seen those pictures?

3866
01:29:45,601 --> 01:29:46,390
I think it was,

3867
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:47,640
might've been Mogadishu.

3868
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:51,270
Have you seen those pictures are like
the of these guys when they were chasing

3869
01:29:51,271 --> 01:29:52,380
dudes with machetes.

3870
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:53,490
Did you remember that shit?

3871
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:55,520
There was like something
going on I think in the,

3872
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:57,240
I think it was Mogadishu years ago.

3873
01:29:58,090 --> 01:29:58,780
It might've been.

3874
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:00,000
That might've been there.

3875
01:30:00,001 --> 01:30:00,211
Yeah,

3876
01:30:00,211 --> 01:30:01,230
that would be a Rwanda then.

3877
01:30:01,231 --> 01:30:02,040
Yeah,

3878
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:05,030
that's the Tutsis and Hutus or what?

3879
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,170
However you say hotel Rwanda.

3880
01:30:07,171 --> 01:30:10,020
But it's crazy to see human
beings chasing each other.

3881
01:30:10,021 --> 01:30:12,270
The dude was like straight up chasing.

3882
01:30:12,271 --> 01:30:13,500
They were chasing this one dude.

3883
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:16,650
They had machetes in their
hands and you sit first,

3884
01:30:16,651 --> 01:30:17,580
first thought is like,

3885
01:30:17,581 --> 01:30:18,361
Holy Shit.

3886
01:30:18,361 --> 01:30:20,750
Second thought is this camera man is not,

3887
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:22,870
he's sitting there going like

3888
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:24,030
picture of this.

3889
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:24,920
You know?

3890
01:30:24,921 --> 01:30:25,401
I'd be like,

3891
01:30:25,401 --> 01:30:25,641
okay,

3892
01:30:25,641 --> 01:30:26,480
I could tell the story.

3893
01:30:26,481 --> 01:30:27,314
I'm not going to plug in.

3894
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:29,720
And then the third thing is
just that poor guy's like,

3895
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,651
he's going to get,

3896
01:30:30,651 --> 01:30:31,850
they're going to catch
him and they're going,

3897
01:30:31,851 --> 01:30:33,380
if I can chop them to pieces.

3898
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:34,010
Yeah,

3899
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:34,910
that is crazy.

3900
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:36,500
Human beings are such assholes.

3901
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:36,971
Well,

3902
01:30:36,971 --> 01:30:37,940
especially in Africa,

3903
01:30:37,941 --> 01:30:38,211
man,

3904
01:30:38,211 --> 01:30:41,920
there's a long history of that should go
on down in Africa and the w whatever we

3905
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:42,411
were talking about,

3906
01:30:42,411 --> 01:30:43,520
the Hutus and the tts.

3907
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:44,121
However you say it.

3908
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:47,420
Somebody correct me to
please somebody on Twitter.

3909
01:30:47,421 --> 01:30:48,254
Correct me.

3910
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:49,400
Those guys,

3911
01:30:49,401 --> 01:30:49,681
you know,

3912
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:52,460
like one of the things about
the horrors of that war is it,

3913
01:30:52,461 --> 01:30:56,220
they would go into a town and kill
thousands of people with machetes.

3914
01:30:56,221 --> 01:30:56,720
Yeah.

3915
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:00,530
Just chop them up and then they would
pollute the river because they were throw

3916
01:31:00,531 --> 01:31:02,180
so many bodies in the river,

3917
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:05,690
but the water from the river road become
undrinkable because it was rotten with

3918
01:31:05,691 --> 01:31:06,524
human bodies.

3919
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:07,131
Yeah.

3920
01:31:07,131 --> 01:31:07,851
It's a fucking,

3921
01:31:07,851 --> 01:31:11,750
it's a terrifying place in
Africa is so fucking wild.

3922
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:17,020
It's so fucking it to this day in 2011
it's probably the wildest place on Earth,

3923
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:17,893
but just Warren

3924
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:18,451
general,

3925
01:31:18,451 --> 01:31:19,410
like they were talking about,

3926
01:31:19,411 --> 01:31:20,640
they just caught one of these other,

3927
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:21,150
uh,

3928
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:21,983
Serbs,

3929
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:23,280
Serbian leaders,

3930
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:23,840
the,

3931
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:24,810
remember there's Milosevic.

3932
01:31:24,811 --> 01:31:26,300
And then there was another
guy that he's just caught,

3933
01:31:26,301 --> 01:31:27,134
I forget his name,

3934
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:27,680
but there,

3935
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:30,720
but they've got all these counts
of a human atrocities against him.

3936
01:31:30,721 --> 01:31:31,321
He was a general,

3937
01:31:31,321 --> 01:31:31,950
I guess.

3938
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:34,920
And he would go into town and they would
capture the enemies and then they would

3939
01:31:34,921 --> 01:31:35,640
say,

3940
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:35,981
he was just,

3941
01:31:35,981 --> 01:31:36,271
I'm like,

3942
01:31:36,271 --> 01:31:37,104
you know,

3943
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:38,100
hey,

3944
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:38,791
it's all good.

3945
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:40,860
We just wanted to capture
the town so all the men,

3946
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:43,680
you guys can come out
and we'll let you go.

3947
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,780
And like the men will come
out and they would mass.

3948
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:46,081
He would,

3949
01:31:46,081 --> 01:31:48,450
they would get them out by
like saying like it's all good.

3950
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,321
And once they come out,

3951
01:31:49,321 --> 01:31:50,670
like they would massacre
the men and then they go,

3952
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:51,600
they raped the women.

3953
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:52,201
I mean it's just like,

3954
01:31:52,201 --> 01:31:53,034
why do you got to do it?

3955
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:54,583
You know what I'm saying?

3956
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,720

Create culture and Perry for one one and
Frederick Lambert and read three read.

3965
01:32:12,370 --> 01:32:13,600
Shout out to my brother in law.

3966
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:15,400
He loves to show PD PD money.

3967
01:32:15,401 --> 01:32:16,390
I don't know if he's listening right now.

3968
01:32:16,391 --> 01:32:17,260
Are Not bloody money.

3969
01:32:17,261 --> 01:32:18,100
What's happening brother?

3970
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:18,761
PD money.

3971
01:32:18,761 --> 01:32:20,470
He loves to show him
and he loves your show.

3972
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:23,470
I was in Vancouver and we came
out of this a steak restaurant.

3973
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:27,700
I was a bad Bobby and a savage signs from
the Rogan board and we stepped out of

3974
01:32:27,701 --> 01:32:29,410
this steak restaurant
and as we stepped out,

3975
01:32:29,411 --> 01:32:29,920
the guy goes,

3976
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:30,640
hey,

3977
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:33,730
and he puts his hand on my shoulder and
then he pulls off his ear buds and shows

3978
01:32:33,731 --> 01:32:35,710
me his iPod and he's
listening to the podcast.

3979
01:32:35,711 --> 01:32:36,210
That's awesome.

3980
01:32:36,210 --> 01:32:37,930
How cool is it was it was ridiculous.

3981
01:32:37,931 --> 01:32:38,351
I was like,

3982
01:32:38,351 --> 01:32:38,831
wow,

3983
01:32:38,831 --> 01:32:39,760
that is fucking nuts,

3984
01:32:39,761 --> 01:32:40,120
man.

3985
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,080
That's a surreal moment,

3986
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:41,321
right?

3987
01:32:41,321 --> 01:32:42,154
So surreal.

3988
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:44,590
It's like I heard sting in an interview.

3989
01:32:44,591 --> 01:32:47,890
He said he knew he was starting to make
it when he was at some meeting in some

3990
01:32:47,891 --> 01:32:49,150
office in the high rise,

3991
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:49,750
and he's,

3992
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:50,860
I don't know if this is true or not.

3993
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:55,510
He said he saw the guy outside clean
the window and the guy was like singing

3994
01:32:55,511 --> 01:32:56,344
Roxanne or some.

3995
01:32:57,630 --> 01:32:57,930
He was like,

3996
01:32:57,930 --> 01:32:58,411
Oh shit.

3997
01:32:58,411 --> 01:32:58,950
I made it.

3998
01:32:58,950 --> 01:32:59,131
Well,

3999
01:32:59,131 --> 01:33:01,290
once Eddie Murphy Sang that in that movie,

4000
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:02,070
Oh my God.

4001
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:02,903
It just became,

4002
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:06,720
I didn't even know about that song until
I saw that movie and Eddie Murphy was

4003
01:33:06,721 --> 01:33:07,411
singing it in the movie.

4004
01:33:07,411 --> 01:33:07,570
Yeah

4005
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:07,871
Dude,

4006
01:33:07,871 --> 01:33:11,230
as a kid that might have been one of my
favorite movie moment cause I went into

4007
01:33:11,231 --> 01:33:13,210
that movie being a huge Eddie Murphy Fan.

4008
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:14,170
How could you not?

4009
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:17,420
And then when they introduce
them like that you like he,

4010
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:17,981
he just,

4011
01:33:17,981 --> 01:33:22,600
he basically lived up to everything you
expected and then that movies has got

4012
01:33:22,601 --> 01:33:22,840
better.

4013
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:26,080
I watched that movie now like you
know when he goes into the bar,

4014
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:26,591
you know,

4015
01:33:26,591 --> 01:33:28,270
you best have yourself a black Russian,

4016
01:33:28,910 --> 01:33:29,411
you know,

4017
01:33:29,411 --> 01:33:30,280
like there's a new sheriff,

4018
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:31,760
their name is Reggie Hammond.

4019
01:33:31,850 --> 01:33:32,330
Oh man,

4020
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:33,590
it's so great man.

4021
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:33,951
Dude,

4022
01:33:33,951 --> 01:33:34,671
he was the best.

4023
01:33:34,671 --> 01:33:39,200
No one was a better comedic actor in a
movie than Eddie Murphy in my opinion.

4024
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:40,490
48 hours.

4025
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:41,750
[inaudible] Nick Naulty,

4026
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,990
he just took off and it was
the right amount of vulnerable,

4027
01:33:44,991 --> 01:33:49,770
the right amount of bad ass and cocky
and the right amount of self deprecating.

4028
01:33:49,771 --> 01:33:51,410
And he was like 22 at that point.

4029
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:52,730
It's ridiculous.

4030
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,260
And a killer stand up.

4031
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,293
Oh my God.

4032
01:33:55,610 --> 01:34:00,050
It's almost a shame that he had all this
problems with trannies and what have

4033
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:00,490
you.

4034
01:34:00,490 --> 01:34:01,550
He doesn't want to go on stage.

4035
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:06,050
He doesn't want people to heckle him
because God damn at one point in time,

4036
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:07,790
if you go back and listen to his shit,

4037
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:11,780
when he was 19 he was a brilliant
comedian and like 19 years old.

4038
01:34:11,781 --> 01:34:12,120
Yeah,

4039
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:12,960
it was very funny actually.

4040
01:34:12,961 --> 01:34:16,080
I rented some like old videos and
there was a comment like a national

4041
01:34:16,081 --> 01:34:17,730
competition and they were,

4042
01:34:17,731 --> 01:34:22,731
they showed the top five winners and he
was fifth place and everyone had heard

4043
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:24,550
of them.

4044
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:25,050
Then on it,

4045
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:26,070
they're not allowed to know anyway.

4046
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:27,013
It's gone.

4047
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:28,710
Well he doesn't even do comedy anymore.

4048
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:30,570
That's the weird thing his brother does.

4049
01:34:30,571 --> 01:34:30,841
You know,

4050
01:34:30,841 --> 01:34:33,330
it's like Charlie's out there
carrying on the family name.

4051
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,810
It's funny because when people ask
me about how I got into comedy,

4052
01:34:35,811 --> 01:34:37,220
I was in college and I'd like,

4053
01:34:37,221 --> 01:34:39,950
I thought about doing it a few times and
I was always intimidated because I had

4054
01:34:39,951 --> 01:34:41,480
done acting in plays,

4055
01:34:41,481 --> 01:34:42,020
but I was on,

4056
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:44,930
I wasn't limited to get in front of an
audience and talk about like my point of

4057
01:34:44,931 --> 01:34:45,171
view.

4058
01:34:45,171 --> 01:34:45,411
It was that,

4059
01:34:45,411 --> 01:34:46,040
you know,

4060
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:49,040
so I was in college and I saw these
two guys and there was just horrible.

4061
01:34:49,041 --> 01:34:50,240
It was a comedy competition.

4062
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,910
And so I told myself the next time
there's a competition I'm just going to do

4063
01:34:52,911 --> 01:34:53,420
it.

4064
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:54,081
So I was telling people,

4065
01:34:54,081 --> 01:34:54,411
I say,

4066
01:34:54,411 --> 01:34:54,800
you know,

4067
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,840
you get inspired by
greatness and mediocrity.

4068
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:58,430
I was inspired by mediocrity.

4069
01:34:58,760 --> 01:34:59,960
And the funny thing is I,

4070
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:01,640
I'm just like maybe a year,

4071
01:35:01,641 --> 01:35:02,570
year and a half ago,

4072
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:06,480
I'm at the comedy store and the
original room on a Tuesday and I,

4073
01:35:06,481 --> 01:35:10,280
and I just came off like this big tour
in Australia where I was like headline in

4074
01:35:10,281 --> 01:35:11,990
front of a lot of people and you know,

4075
01:35:11,991 --> 01:35:12,860
it was like automatic.

4076
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:13,671
I called on a Monday,

4077
01:35:13,671 --> 01:35:15,200
just gave avails for every night.

4078
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:17,510
And so I get a Tuesday night show.

4079
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:19,970
So I go off and it's like
the crowds not that great.

4080
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:20,601
I'm not into it.

4081
01:35:20,601 --> 01:35:21,110
I'm like,

4082
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:21,411
I just,

4083
01:35:21,411 --> 01:35:22,790
I've just got to get off the road doing,

4084
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:23,481
you know,

4085
01:35:23,481 --> 01:35:27,920
thousand people in like an hour 20
and now I've got to do 15 minutes.

4086
01:35:27,921 --> 01:35:29,030
I don't want to try anything new.

4087
01:35:29,031 --> 01:35:29,271
I was like,

4088
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:30,081
I don't even want to be here.

4089
01:35:30,081 --> 01:35:30,291
I was like,

4090
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:31,124
why don't I do this?

4091
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:32,061
I get on stage,

4092
01:35:32,061 --> 01:35:33,440
I'm just all over the place.

4093
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:34,670
Nothing's really hidden.

4094
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:36,740
The only person laughing is Johnny's Zap.

4095
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:37,640
You Know Jack is a,

4096
01:35:37,641 --> 01:35:38,390
yeah sure.

4097
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:40,880
And what's funny about Johnny's APP
is in the past when I first became a

4098
01:35:40,881 --> 01:35:41,150
regular,

4099
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:41,721
the comedy store,

4100
01:35:41,721 --> 01:35:42,351
Johnny's App,

4101
01:35:42,351 --> 01:35:46,580
actually I'd like given me like he
lost a set one time and like he started

4102
01:35:46,581 --> 01:35:48,770
giving me tags and I didn't know
who he was cause he'll tell you,

4103
01:35:48,771 --> 01:35:49,370
he's like,

4104
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:50,930
I was around when Richard Pryor was here,

4105
01:35:50,931 --> 01:35:51,291
this and that.

4106
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:53,000
So I thought he was
like a genius of comedy.

4107
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:53,330
Yeah.

4108
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:57,890
So he gave me like some tags and
quickly I realized it was like no this,

4109
01:35:57,891 --> 01:35:59,960
this is a dude who hangs
out and it was crazy.

4110
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:01,670
Crazy do the hangs out like you know,

4111
01:36:01,671 --> 01:36:03,800
cause then he started give me the
table like these are horrible.

4112
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:07,540
So I'm sitting on stage,

4113
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:11,350
I'm kind of dying and Zap as the only one
laughing and I'm like thank you Johnny

4114
01:36:11,770 --> 01:36:15,400
and a and then I'm getting ready to get
off stage and Steve Burns the next comic

4115
01:36:15,401 --> 01:36:19,000
and Steve always like does like a
long kind of jokey intro for me.

4116
01:36:19,001 --> 01:36:21,370
Like whenever the WHO's next Mazda
Bronnie I don't know who that is.

4117
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:23,170
Well whatever this next guy,

4118
01:36:23,171 --> 01:36:25,000
I'm not sure if guys want to
watch him and he'll do like that.

4119
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:28,360
So I started doing that to Steve and I'm
just riffing a little bit and it's just

4120
01:36:28,361 --> 01:36:30,310
getting like this is a very mediocre set.

4121
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:31,660
I'm walking off stage,

4122
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,130
zap waves me down,

4123
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:34,720
it's a Tuesday night and I'm like,

4124
01:36:34,721 --> 01:36:36,520
Oh God zaps got a tag for me.

4125
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:37,331
And he goes,

4126
01:36:37,331 --> 01:36:37,810
hey man,

4127
01:36:37,810 --> 01:36:38,680
Eddie Murphy's here.

4128
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:41,470
And I thought he was in the main room
cause Eddie Murphy is always in the main

4129
01:36:41,471 --> 01:36:41,800
room,

4130
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,370
right?

4131
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:43,570
So I thought he was like,

4132
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:43,721
oh,

4133
01:36:43,721 --> 01:36:44,351
I didn't know if it in the mirror.

4134
01:36:44,351 --> 01:36:44,621
I was like,

4135
01:36:44,621 --> 01:36:45,430
so what?

4136
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:47,410
So I start walking and as I walk in,

4137
01:36:47,411 --> 01:36:48,040
Eddie was,

4138
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:51,040
Eddie was sitting the whole set
watching my set in Mitzi seat,

4139
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:52,040
you know Mitzi seat.

4140
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:54,070
I walked past Eddie.

4141
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:54,760
I'm like,

4142
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:55,301
oh my God,

4143
01:36:55,301 --> 01:36:56,890
I just died in front of my comedy.

4144
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:58,470
I walked down the steps,

4145
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:02,190
turn around waiting for my
buddy who's coming to get me.

4146
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:03,450
We're going to go to the laugh factory.

4147
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,430
Eddie walks down in front of my buddy.

4148
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:06,780
It gives me the quick little look.

4149
01:37:06,781 --> 01:37:07,501
Doesn't say anything,

4150
01:37:07,501 --> 01:37:08,430
just keep walking.

4151
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:08,970
Oh.

4152
01:37:08,970 --> 01:37:10,110
So in the back of my mind,

4153
01:37:10,111 --> 01:37:11,790
the only saving graces,

4154
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:12,690
I'm thinking to myself,

4155
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:13,261
okay,

4156
01:37:13,261 --> 01:37:14,250
he's going to make a comeback,

4157
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,460
is going to end up on the tonight show.

4158
01:37:15,461 --> 01:37:15,871
I think I'd be like,

4159
01:37:15,871 --> 01:37:17,040
what inspired you to come back?

4160
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:17,461
And He'd be like,

4161
01:37:17,461 --> 01:37:17,611
you know,

4162
01:37:17,611 --> 01:37:19,620
I was watching this mediocre set one time.

4163
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:22,350
The reason he came back,

4164
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:24,150
you brought it anywhere.

4165
01:37:24,151 --> 01:37:24,860
If he backs

4166
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:25,730
how I roll man,

4167
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:26,350
that's Volaris.

4168
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:27,070
So no,

4169
01:37:27,070 --> 01:37:30,430
I was talking about this on the Kevin
Smith show about going on stage and you

4170
01:37:30,431 --> 01:37:32,800
know how some guys will
just go on stage fearlessly.

4171
01:37:32,801 --> 01:37:36,670
Like Chris Rock would go
onstage fearlessly with a
batch of new material and

4172
01:37:36,671 --> 01:37:39,730
just hash it out and see
what the fuck happens.

4173
01:37:39,731 --> 01:37:40,061
And if it,

4174
01:37:40,061 --> 01:37:41,350
if it comes out it comes out.

4175
01:37:41,351 --> 01:37:42,790
But it's,

4176
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:44,080
it's so tough to bomb.

4177
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:47,470
There's a bomb in front of a guy like
Eddie Murphy must be just fucking

4178
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:48,363
terrible.

4179
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:50,020
I was just the mean because,

4180
01:37:50,050 --> 01:37:52,360
oh and here's the funny thing
was halfway through the set,

4181
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:53,191
I'm not kidding,

4182
01:37:53,191 --> 01:37:54,580
was a Tuesday night as I was kind of like,

4183
01:37:54,581 --> 01:37:57,730
cause the whole time I'm going just get
it together and get through it and Ma

4184
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:59,500
and be funny and pat and pardon me,

4185
01:37:59,501 --> 01:37:59,791
he's like,

4186
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:00,630
I'm all over the place.

4187
01:38:00,631 --> 01:38:03,180
So my head's really not into
it and I'm not even like,

4188
01:38:03,181 --> 01:38:04,350
cause sometimes I go up there and just go,

4189
01:38:04,351 --> 01:38:06,660
I'm going to riff for five
minutes for new material.

4190
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:07,673
I just wasn't,

4191
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:08,050
you know,

4192
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:08,910
the year up there I'm like,

4193
01:38:08,911 --> 01:38:11,700
why do I even put in so halfway
through the set I'm like,

4194
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:12,360
dude,

4195
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:15,720
get your shit together and make it a
good set cause somebody might be in the

4196
01:38:15,721 --> 01:38:16,554
audience.

4197
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:19,860
And I swear to God that the
past 12 years I've been there,

4198
01:38:19,861 --> 01:38:21,210
I have never had that thought.

4199
01:38:21,211 --> 01:38:22,380
And I thought to myself,

4200
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:23,061
and then the,

4201
01:38:23,061 --> 01:38:23,340
the,

4202
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:24,061
the other voice,

4203
01:38:24,061 --> 01:38:25,380
the comedy store voice came in my head.

4204
01:38:25,381 --> 01:38:25,980
I was like,

4205
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,040
who the fuck is going to be in the side?

4206
01:38:27,041 --> 01:38:27,750
Like,

4207
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:28,410
you know,

4208
01:38:28,410 --> 01:38:29,191
and who cares?

4209
01:38:29,191 --> 01:38:31,920
Like the whole point of the comedy
store is to go with who cares?

4210
01:38:31,921 --> 01:38:32,101
Like,

4211
01:38:32,101 --> 01:38:32,900
you know,

4212
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:34,590
and so it was one of those like who cares,

4213
01:38:34,730 --> 01:38:37,950
who's cool give in this audience that
has any kind of influence of agent or

4214
01:38:37,951 --> 01:38:38,580
something.

4215
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:39,413
It's fucking Eddie Murphy.

4216
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:43,070
So don't realize when you
talk about the comedy store,

4217
01:38:43,071 --> 01:38:43,371
you know,

4218
01:38:43,371 --> 01:38:46,010
that's like one of like I used
to say when I lived in Boston,

4219
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,903
that was Mecca.

4220
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,150
Yeah.

4221
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:50,720
I would hear about like
Kennison and Richard Pryor
and that was the comedy store

4222
01:38:50,721 --> 01:38:51,554
in Hollywood.

4223
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:53,870
But then you actually get
there and you realize,

4224
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:53,991
Oh,

4225
01:38:53,991 --> 01:38:56,900
this is an insane asylum
and no one's watching it.

4226
01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:58,160
No one's paying any attention.

4227
01:38:58,161 --> 01:39:00,770
And then fucking Mike is just turned
on at one point in the night and then

4228
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:01,790
there's no host.

4229
01:39:01,791 --> 01:39:02,400
Even now,

4230
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,470
convenience tag team.

4231
01:39:03,471 --> 01:39:03,831
What's this?

4232
01:39:03,831 --> 01:39:05,120
No Club in town that does that,

4233
01:39:05,121 --> 01:39:05,954
by the way.

4234
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:07,970
All the comedians just
bring each other up.

4235
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,091
No,

4236
01:39:08,091 --> 01:39:08,980
there's a fucking host,

4237
01:39:08,981 --> 01:39:12,200
like a professional show and the guy
will go up and I'll bring people up and

4238
01:39:12,201 --> 01:39:14,780
I'll do a little time in between and
the give you your intro and get it

4239
01:39:14,781 --> 01:39:15,614
straight.

4240
01:39:15,730 --> 01:39:18,290
This is not a fucking get your
intro straight at the store.

4241
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:18,700
Yeah,

4242
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:19,050
no,

4243
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:19,231
no,

4244
01:39:19,231 --> 01:39:19,940
not at all.

4245
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:21,510
[inaudible] I'll be honest,

4246
01:39:21,511 --> 01:39:23,070
cause that's where I
actually grew as a cop.

4247
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:23,923
Like I,

4248
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:25,160
I'd done one year comedy.

4249
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:25,591
Then it became,

4250
01:39:25,591 --> 01:39:29,940
it became a regular coffee store and it
was great because there was no pressure.

4251
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:31,500
It was like you're going to,

4252
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,030
I got used to shit crowds.

4253
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:36,050
That was what was weird when I started
performing the laugh factory and there's

4254
01:39:36,090 --> 01:39:38,040
real crowds and I was like,

4255
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:38,530
oh my God,

4256
01:39:38,530 --> 01:39:41,350
God you're so nice at
the Improv with the fuck.

4257
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:42,473
It's so weird.

4258
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:47,160
And it's weird seeing guys who started
in town and started at one of the clubs

4259
01:39:47,161 --> 01:39:47,941
with audiences.

4260
01:39:47,941 --> 01:39:51,330
I actually saw a couple of comic comics
one time I saw this at the laugh factory

4261
01:39:51,331 --> 01:39:53,700
one comic go like oh I'm
not going after songs.

4262
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:54,583
So,

4263
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:55,410
and I was like,

4264
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:56,310
oh that's an option.

4265
01:39:57,550 --> 01:39:59,660
I didn't realize I an option at the store.

4266
01:39:59,690 --> 01:40:02,900
I mean how many times did Mitzi
shove you on after some killer,

4267
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:04,820
some Martin Lawrence type character.

4268
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:06,980
Someone would go up and destroy ego,

4269
01:40:06,981 --> 01:40:07,540
Mars

4270
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:08,141
and also,

4271
01:40:08,141 --> 01:40:09,190
and also what happened?

4272
01:40:09,191 --> 01:40:13,000
Like the weirdest one I had was one
time it was one of these thin nights,

4273
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:13,690
not all night,

4274
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:14,740
not much of an audience.

4275
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:16,510
Dice does a stop in,

4276
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:21,750
he's going to do like an hour and the
crowd in is this a thin crowd but it's his

4277
01:40:22,031 --> 01:40:22,301
crowd.

4278
01:40:22,301 --> 01:40:24,370
They start loving him and
I'm trying to like work on,

4279
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:24,880
it was like,

4280
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,230
like kinda towards like,

4281
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:31,420
like the Iraq war and I'm trying to work
on some like war antiwar ship political

4282
01:40:31,421 --> 01:40:32,020
shit.

4283
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:32,890
And he's doing like,

4284
01:40:32,891 --> 01:40:33,350
you know,

4285
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:33,621
you know,

4286
01:40:33,621 --> 01:40:36,240
fuck ass and fuck this fucking name

4287
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:38,020
it,

4288
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:38,271
doing it,

4289
01:40:38,271 --> 01:40:38,451
doing it,

4290
01:40:38,451 --> 01:40:39,284
and they're loving them.

4291
01:40:39,290 --> 01:40:40,011
And then it was weird.

4292
01:40:40,011 --> 01:40:44,390
He does one joke and somehow there was
feedback on the mic and he just looks at

4293
01:40:44,391 --> 01:40:45,440
the mic for a second.

4294
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:47,270
They looks at the audience,

4295
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:49,970
he drops the mic and he walks off

4296
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:52,311
and the,

4297
01:40:52,311 --> 01:40:53,440
and the piano is not there.

4298
01:40:53,441 --> 01:40:54,310
There's no one there,

4299
01:40:54,311 --> 01:40:54,740
no one,

4300
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:55,181
like you said,

4301
01:40:55,181 --> 01:40:58,300
no one is running the asylum
and nobody even said like,

4302
01:40:58,301 --> 01:40:58,840
who's next?

4303
01:40:58,840 --> 01:40:59,800
It's just dead.

4304
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:00,970
And the artist is kind of like,

4305
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:01,720
that's weird.

4306
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:02,310
And no one's there.

4307
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:03,100
So I'm like,

4308
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:03,581
I'm next.

4309
01:41:03,581 --> 01:41:04,414
I got to go up.

4310
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:06,340
So I had to go up on stage and be like,

4311
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:07,151
hey,

4312
01:41:07,151 --> 01:41:07,920
how are you guys doing?

4313
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:08,830
I'm Mazda Ronnie.

4314
01:41:08,831 --> 01:41:10,120
Nobody knew who the fuck I was.

4315
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:12,850
You know that that just makes you tough.

4316
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:13,331
You learn,

4317
01:41:13,331 --> 01:41:14,164
you know what I'm saying?

4318
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:17,650
My hardest sats were fallen
dice at a bunch of hearts sets,

4319
01:41:17,651 --> 01:41:18,484
fallen dice.

4320
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,200
How fallen dice fallen.

4321
01:41:20,201 --> 01:41:21,070
Martin Lawrence,

4322
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:23,800
fallen men steelier following fall.

4323
01:41:23,801 --> 01:41:26,620
Richard Pryor when Richard
Pryor was still doing stand up.

4324
01:41:26,621 --> 01:41:27,210
Shit.

4325
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:27,760
Yeah,

4326
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:28,181
those were,

4327
01:41:28,181 --> 01:41:29,080
those were weird times,

4328
01:41:29,081 --> 01:41:30,670
but Mitzi was always
real smart about that.

4329
01:41:30,671 --> 01:41:31,720
If she thought you were any good,

4330
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:33,340
she wasn't going to give you an easy spot.

4331
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,350
If she thought you were
decent and you had a,

4332
01:41:35,351 --> 01:41:35,711
you know,

4333
01:41:35,711 --> 01:41:39,100
a spark in you should throw you
on in the worst position possible.

4334
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:39,641
What is it?

4335
01:41:39,641 --> 01:41:40,630
A black show?

4336
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:41,171
Yeah.

4337
01:41:41,171 --> 01:41:43,490
Pulling them on after Amar and Laurie

4338
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:47,030
and she would think it's
funny knowing that you get,

4339
01:41:47,370 --> 01:41:48,510
I think that would be fun.

4340
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:49,523
I think that would be like,

4341
01:41:49,530 --> 01:41:54,370
like the best challenges that have just
being able to try that or it is what?

4342
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:55,320
After it's over.

4343
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:55,950
Yeah.

4344
01:41:55,950 --> 01:41:57,090
Well here's the thing.

4345
01:41:57,091 --> 01:42:02,091
Sometimes sometimes it works well if
you go in there with like I'm fucked

4346
01:42:02,491 --> 01:42:03,121
mentality.

4347
01:42:03,121 --> 01:42:03,331
Yeah.

4348
01:42:03,331 --> 01:42:04,440
If you ride the wave though,

4349
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:06,660
one time I did one time they were,

4350
01:42:06,661 --> 01:42:08,580
they were doing something
in the main room.

4351
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:09,623
It was like a,

4352
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:13,650
it was the black film festival and they
had a comedy show and was supposed to be

4353
01:42:13,651 --> 01:42:14,790
headlined by Eddie Griffin.

4354
01:42:14,850 --> 01:42:19,110
So people had to actually come expecting
Eddie and Eddie walked in and saw that

4355
01:42:19,111 --> 01:42:20,550
they'd sold tickets and he's like,

4356
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:21,960
I'm not getting paid or some shit.

4357
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:23,580
He got upset about something.

4358
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:24,120
He's like,

4359
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:24,990
I'm not going up.

4360
01:42:25,290 --> 01:42:27,690
So then so then someone
came to me and they're like,

4361
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,490
hey we need you to get in there,

4362
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:31,410
the close out the show.

4363
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:34,980
So they're expecting to Eddie Griffin
and I walk up and it was so funny cause

4364
01:42:34,981 --> 01:42:35,340
they just,

4365
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:38,340
everyone just got up and started walking
out and like there was like one table

4366
01:42:38,341 --> 01:42:43,000
that hung out and literally like I was
so like defeat at the top that I just,

4367
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:43,830
I was like,

4368
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:44,530
thanks for hanging out.

4369
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:44,791
I said,

4370
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:45,550
I feel like I'm,

4371
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:45,770
I'm,

4372
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:46,350
I'm the,

4373
01:42:46,350 --> 01:42:48,060
I'm the rolling credits
at the end of the film.

4374
01:42:48,090 --> 01:42:50,400
I said that's what it feels
like for the film fest.

4375
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:53,280
If it was just leaving and that one
table was with me because it was all safe

4376
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:55,410
self deprecating material
because it was like,

4377
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:55,921
you know,

4378
01:42:55,921 --> 01:42:56,910
what am I doing here?

4379
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:57,931
And it was like 15,

4380
01:42:57,931 --> 01:42:58,764
20 minutes of that.

4381
01:42:58,800 --> 01:42:59,940
And you live sometimes though,

4382
01:42:59,941 --> 01:43:03,970
if you go into that situation where
it's still kind of a hot crowd and,

4383
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:08,760
and then you go in and now you got to
perform in f and it's like they get,

4384
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:09,240
you know,

4385
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,320
they're not laughing and,

4386
01:43:10,410 --> 01:43:12,780
and then you try some crowd
work and it's not working.

4387
01:43:13,650 --> 01:43:16,470
I had that on a Mo Betta
Mondays if the Improv one time.

4388
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,720
And it was funny cause
I'd gotten good cause I,

4389
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:19,260
cause I did,

4390
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:19,830
um,

4391
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:20,850
I did Friday after next,

4392
01:43:20,851 --> 01:43:23,160
so I had some street credit in the black,

4393
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:23,820
black,

4394
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:24,653
black community,

4395
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:26,450
the [inaudible] and uh,

4396
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:28,830
and s as a holy moly donut shop.

4397
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:29,131
You know,

4398
01:43:29,131 --> 01:43:29,371
this,

4399
01:43:29,371 --> 01:43:30,890
this character in the movie.

4400
01:43:30,910 --> 01:43:32,310
So I'd been doing,

4401
01:43:32,610 --> 01:43:32,911
you know,

4402
01:43:32,911 --> 01:43:34,290
I did chocolate Sundays,

4403
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:37,590
I did that with copy store one and then
I overheard a few people talking about

4404
01:43:37,591 --> 01:43:40,410
how Mo Betta Mondays was one
of the toughest black rooms.

4405
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:40,921
I was like,

4406
01:43:40,921 --> 01:43:43,560
how tough could it be and
I'm getting ready to go on.

4407
01:43:43,770 --> 01:43:45,150
And this one other comic was like,

4408
01:43:45,151 --> 01:43:45,511
Hey man,

4409
01:43:45,511 --> 01:43:47,400
you got your shit together
to in Tripoli was there too.

4410
01:43:47,401 --> 01:43:48,031
He's like listen bro,

4411
01:43:48,031 --> 01:43:49,680
just hang in there to Dah Dah Dah Dah.

4412
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:55,130
And I went up and I ate so much shit
cause it was this like it was a crowd

4413
01:43:55,131 --> 01:43:55,880
because you go in there,

4414
01:43:55,880 --> 01:44:00,200
it was early in the show and you
expect it to be a good crowd.

4415
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:03,590
And it's one of those things where you
get like a couple of laughs and like you

4416
01:44:03,591 --> 01:44:06,760
hear the pin drop kind of thing and then
you try another joke is not working.

4417
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:10,280
Then you try some crowd work and is not
working and then you start going against

4418
01:44:10,281 --> 01:44:13,670
your own instincts or your instincts
like okay attack that attack the CIC

4419
01:44:13,671 --> 01:44:14,540
wearing the pink,

4420
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:15,351
you know,

4421
01:44:15,351 --> 01:44:19,940
whatever the whatever the pink
fucking antennas for whatever,

4422
01:44:19,941 --> 01:44:20,301
you know,

4423
01:44:20,301 --> 01:44:20,750
attack,

4424
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:22,880
attack the dude in the
purple leather suit.

4425
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:23,091
You know,

4426
01:44:23,091 --> 01:44:23,990
it's just funny.

4427
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:24,891
But then,

4428
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:25,580
but then you're like,

4429
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:25,851
no,

4430
01:44:25,851 --> 01:44:26,800
they're going to kick your ass.

4431
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:29,900
And then he's just going to like,

4432
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:31,131
give me that light,

4433
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:31,530
man.

4434
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:33,350
Let me get ready to pick on
someone when you're bombing.

4435
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:34,243
Oh my God.

4436
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:34,881
It's really,

4437
01:44:34,881 --> 01:44:36,140
you don't feel confident to pick out,

4438
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:36,983
so yeah.

4439
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:37,810
Oh,

4440
01:44:37,810 --> 01:44:38,810
it's the worst

4441
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:40,450
bombing and a black crowd is a,

4442
01:44:40,451 --> 01:44:42,970
is really hard too because it's
very hard to pull yourself out.

4443
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:43,260
Oh yeah.

4444
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:44,093
Once it goes down,

4445
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:47,590
white crowds will give you some room
and Albert Black crowds like next.

4446
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:48,400
Yeah.

4447
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:52,450
Kay has a great story about bombing on
Mo Betta Mondays that he went up and he

4448
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:52,660
goes,

4449
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:54,490
he realized that there was no recovering.

4450
01:44:54,491 --> 01:44:56,110
Like they w they didn't
want you to recover.

4451
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:56,761
You know,

4452
01:44:56,761 --> 01:44:57,250
like he,

4453
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:59,380
he tried out a joke and it wasn't,

4454
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,510
it didn't work and that was it.

4455
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:01,841
They were like,

4456
01:45:01,841 --> 01:45:02,351
next,

4457
01:45:02,351 --> 01:45:02,980
get off.

4458
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:03,340
You're like,

4459
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:03,731
wait a minute.

4460
01:45:03,731 --> 01:45:05,110
I could try some other shit.

4461
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:06,010
Nope.

4462
01:45:06,010 --> 01:45:06,670
Get outta here.

4463
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:07,503
Come on guys.

4464
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:07,940
Yeah,

4465
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:08,680
it's uh,

4466
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:09,513
it's,

4467
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:09,910
you know,

4468
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:10,840
I think it's also,

4469
01:45:10,870 --> 01:45:13,810
it's good to do like a room like
that where people don't have any,

4470
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:14,190
the,

4471
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:14,680
you know,

4472
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,030
they have no problem with Boone.

4473
01:45:16,031 --> 01:45:17,050
You off the stage real quick.

4474
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:17,190
Oh,

4475
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:19,000
it's not the best thing
to do all the time,

4476
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,520
but every now and then it's
good as a little reality check.

4477
01:45:22,270 --> 01:45:24,030
You Shit better be tight son,

4478
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:25,990
but it come out that gate swinging.

4479
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:26,790
Yeah.

4480
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:27,070
Yeah.

4481
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:28,480
And the most important thing is what?

4482
01:45:28,510 --> 01:45:30,700
The first bit that first
bit gotta be strong.

4483
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:31,563
Oh hell yeah.

4484
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:32,110
Oh yeah.

4485
01:45:32,110 --> 01:45:34,450
Oh you want to open with
your closer if it's possible,

4486
01:45:34,451 --> 01:45:37,210
if you don't need to set that bitch
up with your personality beforehand.

4487
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:37,741
Yeah,

4488
01:45:37,741 --> 01:45:38,290
you're right.

4489
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:38,521
Right.

4490
01:45:38,521 --> 01:45:39,330
Yeah.

4491
01:45:39,330 --> 01:45:41,490
But the other good thing that
you learned when you do that,

4492
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:42,930
cause I remember learning this early on,

4493
01:45:42,931 --> 01:45:45,600
I was like never believed the height
because there's sometimes some nights

4494
01:45:45,601 --> 01:45:50,270
you'll kill and you're like I am God and
then some nice you die and like you'd

4495
01:45:50,271 --> 01:45:50,770
like depressed.

4496
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:51,061
I was like,

4497
01:45:51,061 --> 01:45:52,740
you can never go with like the,

4498
01:45:52,741 --> 01:45:56,160
the good thing about these lessons
on those things is to go listen man,

4499
01:45:56,161 --> 01:45:57,000
my Shit's funny.

4500
01:45:57,610 --> 01:45:58,950
They didn't work tonight.

4501
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:00,690
But that's a funny joke.

4502
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,360
That's a funny joke.

4503
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:02,670
I've had sets before where,

4504
01:46:02,671 --> 01:46:04,140
and usually it happens in the comic store,

4505
01:46:04,141 --> 01:46:04,690
original room.

4506
01:46:04,690 --> 01:46:06,300
Where's not like an all black crowd.

4507
01:46:06,301 --> 01:46:08,070
It's like this crowd of crowd of like,

4508
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:09,150
you know,

4509
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:10,440
few Norwegians,

4510
01:46:10,441 --> 01:46:11,430
couple Ozzie's,

4511
01:46:11,431 --> 01:46:13,200
couple of La hipsters.

4512
01:46:13,201 --> 01:46:13,700
It's just,

4513
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:18,120
it's all this like mixed crowd and I'm
having a blast and they're not laughing.

4514
01:46:18,121 --> 01:46:19,770
And I've seen comedians like be like,

4515
01:46:19,771 --> 01:46:19,951
you know,

4516
01:46:19,951 --> 01:46:20,731
you guys don't get it,

4517
01:46:20,731 --> 01:46:21,391
but I don't even go to the,

4518
01:46:21,391 --> 01:46:21,821
you don't get it.

4519
01:46:21,821 --> 01:46:23,250
I just go like guys,

4520
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:23,970
that was a,

4521
01:46:23,970 --> 01:46:24,630
that was a funny,

4522
01:46:24,630 --> 01:46:25,120
like,

4523
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:25,953
I'm Kinda like,

4524
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:27,090
you guys won't be on the ride.

4525
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:27,541
That's fine.

4526
01:46:27,541 --> 01:46:28,374
I think that was funny.

4527
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:28,921
You know,

4528
01:46:28,921 --> 01:46:29,220
and I,

4529
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:30,053
I know I'm funny,

4530
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:31,170
so fuck you guys.

4531
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,060
And I got another eight
minutes and I'm done.

4532
01:46:33,090 --> 01:46:33,740
You know.

4533
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:34,011
Well,

4534
01:46:34,011 --> 01:46:34,221
you know,

4535
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:37,490
the problem with comedy I've always
said is that it's just called comedy and

4536
01:46:37,491 --> 01:46:41,540
it's not like you never go to a club to
see live music and it says live music

4537
01:46:41,541 --> 01:46:43,910
and you don't know if you're going to
get a rap band or if you're going to get

4538
01:46:43,911 --> 01:46:46,730
fucking guns and roses or classical music.

4539
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:48,170
It's very clear.

4540
01:46:48,171 --> 01:46:50,430
You know what you're going to go to
when you go to a blues club again to get

4541
01:46:50,431 --> 01:46:51,001
some blues.

4542
01:46:51,001 --> 01:46:52,890
But when you go to a comedy club,

4543
01:46:52,891 --> 01:46:53,161
man,

4544
01:46:53,161 --> 01:46:54,030
you can get anything.

4545
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:54,360
Yeah.

4546
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:56,220
How you could get by as Giovanni,

4547
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:57,330
you could get Dang cooked,

4548
01:46:57,331 --> 01:46:58,230
you could get this guy,

4549
01:46:58,231 --> 01:46:59,050
you get that guy,

4550
01:46:59,050 --> 01:47:00,360
everyone's got a different taste.

4551
01:47:00,361 --> 01:47:05,361
And some people might love
Judas Freelander and some
people might hate him and

4552
01:47:06,061 --> 01:47:07,250
love Tracy Morgan.

4553
01:47:07,251 --> 01:47:07,480
And so,

4554
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:07,711
you know,

4555
01:47:07,711 --> 01:47:08,000
it's like,

4556
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:08,610
it's like,

4557
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:10,290
it's all so subjective.

4558
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:10,861
Yeah.

4559
01:47:10,861 --> 01:47:12,240
That's got to find your audience.

4560
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:15,480
And one of the beautiful things about
showing up places where it's not your

4561
01:47:15,481 --> 01:47:17,480
audience to showing up
on some random night at,

4562
01:47:17,510 --> 01:47:17,910
uh,

4563
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:20,520
at the Improv is that
you can't stack the deck.

4564
01:47:20,521 --> 01:47:22,890
So you have to make some people
laugh that don't even fucking know.

4565
01:47:22,891 --> 01:47:24,420
You don't know know your shit.

4566
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:28,290
So I'm sure now you must get these
huge crowds of people who know Mazda,

4567
01:47:28,291 --> 01:47:28,621
Ronnie.

4568
01:47:28,621 --> 01:47:29,800
So they come out to see you.

4569
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:30,810
You know?

4570
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:33,020
But I think every now and then
you got to go in front of,

4571
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:34,380
I love actually I love,

4572
01:47:34,381 --> 01:47:35,340
like I always say like,

4573
01:47:35,370 --> 01:47:38,130
I don't like to be in front
of everyone that knows me.

4574
01:47:38,131 --> 01:47:39,750
One reason is you feel like,

4575
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:39,961
okay,

4576
01:47:39,961 --> 01:47:43,710
they might have heard a lot of this shit
even if it's new now with the Internet

4577
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:44,573
it's gone.

4578
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:45,060
Yep.

4579
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:45,510
Um,

4580
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:46,201
and secondly,

4581
01:47:46,201 --> 01:47:46,861
I love,

4582
01:47:46,861 --> 01:47:48,050
I just love like,

4583
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:48,661
like for example,

4584
01:47:48,661 --> 01:47:51,930
one thing that happens with my audience
is like what happened was when we first

4585
01:47:51,931 --> 01:47:56,190
did the ACCC evil comedy tour came out
on comedy central and a lot of young like

4586
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,170
middle easterners started following us.

4587
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:02,040
But then they started bringing their
parents and growing up like in the Middle

4588
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:02,491
Eastern community,

4589
01:48:02,491 --> 01:48:03,300
like it's like,

4590
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:03,710
you know,

4591
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:04,640
you're very like your,

4592
01:48:04,641 --> 01:48:05,820
you don't go to blue.

4593
01:48:05,821 --> 01:48:06,001
Like,

4594
01:48:06,001 --> 01:48:06,211
you know,

4595
01:48:06,211 --> 01:48:07,500
you gotta be nice and polite.

4596
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:07,651
I mean,

4597
01:48:07,651 --> 01:48:08,041
you could get,

4598
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:08,221
you know,

4599
01:48:08,221 --> 01:48:08,821
get a little edgy,

4600
01:48:08,821 --> 01:48:10,020
but you don't cuss.

4601
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:10,501
You know,

4602
01:48:10,501 --> 01:48:13,890
like there's a whole thing like for the
longest time with my mom and my like I

4603
01:48:13,891 --> 01:48:14,280
was just,

4604
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,113
it was a still to me.

4605
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:16,260
Don't cost,

4606
01:48:16,261 --> 01:48:17,280
definitely not around,

4607
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:17,820
you know,

4608
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:18,451
Persians,

4609
01:48:18,451 --> 01:48:19,284
you're not going to cost.

4610
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:20,790
How much do you cuss on stage ever?

4611
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:21,720
I don't cuss much.

4612
01:48:21,721 --> 01:48:22,501
I cuss a little bit,

4613
01:48:22,501 --> 01:48:23,041
but I actually,

4614
01:48:23,041 --> 01:48:27,720
what's funny is I like now what I do is
if I make a reference to something like,

4615
01:48:27,721 --> 01:48:30,060
like there's a joke I do where
I mentioned masturbation,

4616
01:48:30,450 --> 01:48:32,550
I actually make fun of that.

4617
01:48:32,551 --> 01:48:33,720
That's why I love having a mixed audience.

4618
01:48:33,721 --> 01:48:34,230
Cause I'll look,

4619
01:48:34,230 --> 01:48:35,550
I'll look at the white
guy in the audience.

4620
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:36,630
I go now,

4621
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:37,171
Hey Mike,

4622
01:48:37,171 --> 01:48:39,540
right now there's a table
of Persian is going,

4623
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:40,410
oh my God,

4624
01:48:40,411 --> 01:48:42,260
he said masturbation.

4625
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:42,770
You know,

4626
01:48:42,770 --> 01:48:43,850
I brought my mother,

4627
01:48:43,851 --> 01:48:45,440
she doesn't speak English.

4628
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:46,251
Now I have to travel.

4629
01:48:46,251 --> 01:48:47,840
It must've Bishan at the Farsi.

4630
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:50,120
So riff on what thinking.

4631
01:48:50,570 --> 01:48:54,560
And inevitably there's always like this
one table that's dying of laughter.

4632
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,480
And I've had people come
up after the show be like,

4633
01:48:56,481 --> 01:48:56,960
dude,

4634
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,580
I was here with my mom when
you were saying that shit.

4635
01:48:58,581 --> 01:48:59,414
It was totally true.

4636
01:48:59,570 --> 01:49:00,860
And the mother's totally cool with it.

4637
01:49:00,861 --> 01:49:01,161
I was just,

4638
01:49:01,161 --> 01:49:02,240
I had this recently,

4639
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:02,810
um,

4640
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:03,111
it,

4641
01:49:03,111 --> 01:49:03,261
uh,

4642
01:49:03,261 --> 01:49:07,280
at the Tampa Improv I was doing it and
there was literally this old very like

4643
01:49:07,550 --> 01:49:12,440
distinguished sweet older lady that
was the mother of this other lady.

4644
01:49:12,441 --> 01:49:14,150
So the other lady was like my mom's age.

4645
01:49:14,151 --> 01:49:14,511
The other,

4646
01:49:14,511 --> 01:49:14,771
the,

4647
01:49:14,771 --> 01:49:15,140
the,

4648
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:18,860
the mother was like my grandmother's
age and I said masturbation.

4649
01:49:18,861 --> 01:49:19,694
I did the riff.

4650
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:23,390
And the funny part of the whole
thing was as I was doing the riff,

4651
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:28,670
the mother was leaning into
the grandmother translating
everything and I was

4652
01:49:28,671 --> 01:49:28,890
like,

4653
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:30,980
Holy Shit is actually
happening in the crowd.

4654
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:31,401
Loved it.

4655
01:49:31,401 --> 01:49:33,530
Cause I was making fun of it
but it was actually happening.

4656
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:34,390
Oh that's funny.

4657
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:34,910
Yeah.

4658
01:49:34,910 --> 01:49:35,480
That's funny.

4659
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:35,700
Where,

4660
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:37,040
where do you like performing the best?

4661
01:49:38,110 --> 01:49:38,771
God I love,

4662
01:49:38,771 --> 01:49:39,604
I mean,

4663
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:43,690
I mean I still love the original
room just for creativity purposes,

4664
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:44,320
you know?

4665
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,153
Um,

4666
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:46,090
um,

4667
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:46,481
and then,

4668
01:49:46,481 --> 01:49:48,490
and then what did with
that Tuesday night thing?

4669
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:49,353
I mean I guess,

4670
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:49,751
look,

4671
01:49:49,751 --> 01:49:52,540
we all love killing in front of
our audience is like whenever like,

4672
01:49:52,541 --> 01:49:55,420
like some of the cities I love
like is one of my favorite cities.

4673
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,081
First of all,

4674
01:49:56,081 --> 01:49:57,280
one of the things I love about DC,

4675
01:49:57,281 --> 01:49:58,540
it's very international.

4676
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:00,910
Secondly everyone in DC is doing shit.

4677
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:03,400
Like whenever I spent a couple of
days in DC you meet people like,

4678
01:50:03,401 --> 01:50:03,581
Hey,

4679
01:50:03,581 --> 01:50:04,061
where do you work?

4680
01:50:04,061 --> 01:50:05,200
Is like I work at state.

4681
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:07,120
Oh what's the State Department?

4682
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:07,451
Oh okay,

4683
01:50:07,451 --> 01:50:07,810
cool.

4684
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:08,141
What do you do?

4685
01:50:08,141 --> 01:50:09,480
I look at the agency agency.

4686
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:13,530
Cia Let people actually like doing and
I would say like when I went there that

4687
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:13,881

4688
01:50:13,881 --> 01:50:14,380
it was good.

4689
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:14,800
The trip.

4690
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,360
I would hate that it,

4691
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,100
no it's dance for the CIA.

4692
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:18,491
No Dude,

4693
01:50:18,491 --> 01:50:20,200
it's the craziest thing cause
like I would say like I,

4694
01:50:20,290 --> 01:50:21,160
I was there recently,

4695
01:50:21,161 --> 01:50:21,431
I was like,

4696
01:50:21,431 --> 01:50:21,731

4697
01:50:21,731 --> 01:50:22,990

01:50:24,630 --> 01:50:24,880
They'll be like,

4701
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:25,001
oh,

4702
01:50:25,001 --> 01:50:27,880
I'm working on a movie
about a spy who goes to,

4703
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:28,241
you know,

4704
01:50:28,241 --> 01:50:28,840
to,

4705
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:30,730
to South America to
overthrow the government.

4706
01:50:30,731 --> 01:50:31,810
I go when you come to DC though,

4707
01:50:31,811 --> 01:50:32,201
what are you doing?

4708
01:50:32,201 --> 01:50:32,650
He's like,

4709
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:35,980
I'm a spy who was going to go to
South America over though and I love,

4710
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:39,250
but it's just you feel like you're in
the heart of like you meet people that

4711
01:50:39,251 --> 01:50:40,690
mean like are doing shit.

4712
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:42,850
I remember one time being
that actually I had a moment,

4713
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,140
I remember I was,

4714
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:44,651
I was there,

4715
01:50:44,651 --> 01:50:48,430
it was right at the time of like right
in the heart of the Bush administration

4716
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:49,580
and remember uh,

4717
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:50,080
um,

4718
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,010
homeland security.

4719
01:50:51,190 --> 01:50:51,851
Tom Ridge,

4720
01:50:51,851 --> 01:50:52,390
remember him,

4721
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:55,420
he was the first guy and you see
them on TV and he's a talking head.

4722
01:50:55,421 --> 01:50:56,254
He's an older dude.

4723
01:50:56,410 --> 01:51:01,210
I was outside this like fancy restaurant
in DC and he's sitting there talking to

4724
01:51:01,211 --> 01:51:02,950
this like attractive young girl,

4725
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:05,530
kind of like you could tell his
body language was all flirty,

4726
01:51:05,531 --> 01:51:06,100
you know?

4727
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:07,510
And he's a big dude too.

4728
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:08,261
And I was like,

4729
01:51:08,261 --> 01:51:10,840
this guy's just trying to
get pussy like everyone else.

4730
01:51:11,350 --> 01:51:11,621
I was like,

4731
01:51:11,621 --> 01:51:13,180
he's the head of homeland security.

4732
01:51:13,181 --> 01:51:14,014
He probably be like,

4733
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:14,441
Hey,

4734
01:51:14,441 --> 01:51:14,840
you want me to,

4735
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:15,141
you want,

4736
01:51:15,141 --> 01:51:15,470
you want,

4737
01:51:15,470 --> 01:51:16,420
you want to see the terror alert.

4738
01:51:16,421 --> 01:51:18,040
Go to Orange County,

4739
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:19,210
maybe you want to see the red button.

4740
01:51:20,290 --> 01:51:21,210
That's hilarious.

4741
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:24,550
But you see those kinds of guys when
you're out there as opposed to la as

4742
01:51:24,551 --> 01:51:25,510
opposed to like anywhere.

4743
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:25,990
I mean you don't,

4744
01:51:25,990 --> 01:51:26,950
you don't see that.

4745
01:51:26,951 --> 01:51:29,190
Let you know to live out here still is.

4746
01:51:29,191 --> 01:51:29,560
You do it.

4747
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:31,420
You're doing most of
your work is on the road,

4748
01:51:31,421 --> 01:51:31,571
right?

4749
01:51:31,571 --> 01:51:31,640
Yeah.

4750
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:32,351
Most of my words on the road,

4751
01:51:32,351 --> 01:51:32,980
I mean I live,

4752
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:33,611

4753
01:51:33,611 --> 01:51:35,500
I love la in that my family's here.

4754
01:51:35,710 --> 01:51:37,510
A lot of my friends are
here and weather wise,

4755
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:39,070
you know how it is when you
travel around the world,

4756
01:51:39,071 --> 01:51:43,500
you come back like I was in Norway
and it's like negative land.

4757
01:51:43,501 --> 01:51:46,570
They're like negative three
with windshield windshield.

4758
01:51:46,571 --> 01:51:48,040
It's like w windshield factor.

4759
01:51:48,041 --> 01:51:48,761
It's you know,

4760
01:51:48,761 --> 01:51:50,800
negative 15 or even Chicago,

4761
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:52,390
which is a great city.

4762
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:53,890
But in December it's a mother fucker.

4763
01:51:53,891 --> 01:51:54,101
I'm like,

4764
01:51:54,101 --> 01:51:55,300
what is wrong with you people,

4765
01:51:55,301 --> 01:51:55,660
you know?

4766
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:56,411
And the beauty of La,

4767
01:51:56,411 --> 01:51:58,690
I always say the great thing
about La is it's so close to such,

4768
01:51:58,780 --> 01:51:59,221
so many great.

4769
01:51:59,221 --> 01:52:00,520
But I grew up in the bay area,

4770
01:52:00,521 --> 01:52:01,690
so I love going up to the bay.

4771
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:02,890
You go to Santa Barbara,

4772
01:52:02,891 --> 01:52:03,521
you go to Vegas,

4773
01:52:03,521 --> 01:52:03,910
you go to s,

4774
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:05,110
you know San Diego,

4775
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:06,280
everything's close by.

4776
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:06,890
Yeah.

4777
01:52:06,890 --> 01:52:07,930
La is an amazing city.

4778
01:52:07,931 --> 01:52:08,980
It's just overpopulated.

4779
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:09,560
Oh yeah.

4780
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:09,780
If,

4781
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:11,170
if we didn't live in la though,

4782
01:52:11,171 --> 01:52:12,790
it probably so much more enticing.

4783
01:52:12,791 --> 01:52:14,470
I would say that like
when I'm driving around,

4784
01:52:14,471 --> 01:52:14,681
God,

4785
01:52:14,681 --> 01:52:16,000
if I wasn't a live here,

4786
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:17,260
I probably appreciate this more.

4787
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:18,341
I'd probably like,

4788
01:52:18,341 --> 01:52:18,641
wow,

4789
01:52:18,641 --> 01:52:20,590
what an incredible place
I should live in La.

4790
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:21,860
There's,

4791
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:22,250
there's a,

4792
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:25,300
a great amount of shitheads in this city,

4793
01:52:25,301 --> 01:52:26,670
but it's just because the numbers,

4794
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:27,820
the numbers are so high.

4795
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:28,411
But I mean the,

4796
01:52:28,411 --> 01:52:28,571
you know,

4797
01:52:28,571 --> 01:52:29,291
what is funny?

4798
01:52:29,291 --> 01:52:29,501
Like,

4799
01:52:29,501 --> 01:52:30,490
like whenever I go to New York,

4800
01:52:30,491 --> 01:52:31,810
I love New York in terms of like,

4801
01:52:31,811 --> 01:52:33,100
it's like a playground for adults.

4802
01:52:33,101 --> 01:52:34,990
Like you just jumped in a cab
to go to the next restaurant,

4803
01:52:34,991 --> 01:52:35,771
you go to the next club,

4804
01:52:35,771 --> 01:52:35,981
you go to,

4805
01:52:35,981 --> 01:52:36,850
what are you going all night?

4806
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:38,470
You want to live there?

4807
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:39,360
I would want to know.

4808
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:39,971
Well I actually,

4809
01:52:39,971 --> 01:52:43,790
I'd always thought I wanted to live there
and then I did two projects out there

4810
01:52:43,791 --> 01:52:46,040
where I was there for four months at a and

4811
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:49,850
it was like I got an apartment at the
corner of Houseton six which is like the

4812
01:52:49,851 --> 01:52:50,870
heart of the village.

4813
01:52:50,871 --> 01:52:51,111
I was like,

4814
01:52:51,111 --> 01:52:56,111
this is the best place dude from
7:00 AM till 3:00 AM every day.

4815
01:52:56,331 --> 01:52:57,860
It was like noise outside.

4816
01:52:57,861 --> 01:53:00,400
It was just so like cars punking and and,

4817
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:01,820
and construction.

4818
01:53:01,821 --> 01:53:02,654
And I was like,

4819
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,040
you know,

4820
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:04,010
New York I think is good.

4821
01:53:04,011 --> 01:53:07,520
If you're in your 20s and you got your
buddies and you're all making some money

4822
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:09,170
and you just want to run around,

4823
01:53:09,171 --> 01:53:11,540
like I guess the ratio of
women to men is like this.

4824
01:53:11,541 --> 01:53:12,080
Like I don't,

4825
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:12,380
I don't know,

4826
01:53:12,380 --> 01:53:14,450
it's like 55 to 45 or so.

4827
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:15,720
A lot more women than men.

4828
01:53:15,721 --> 01:53:17,480
And there's a lot of models
walking around New York.

4829
01:53:18,450 --> 01:53:19,440
How about you?

4830
01:53:19,450 --> 01:53:23,690
So if I had like beaucoup
Howard stern type co cashflow,

4831
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:24,900
I would be into live in,

4832
01:53:24,930 --> 01:53:25,190
in,

4833
01:53:25,190 --> 01:53:26,170
in New England.

4834
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:30,350
I did Manhattan like with some sort of
a apartment that overlooks like central

4835
01:53:30,351 --> 01:53:31,640
park or something like that.

4836
01:53:31,890 --> 01:53:33,350
If you've got like Madonna money,

4837
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:38,210
get some one of those crazy $20 million
apartments because I've seen some

4838
01:53:38,211 --> 01:53:38,691
online,

4839
01:53:38,691 --> 01:53:40,820
some people put some up on
my message board as well.

4840
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:41,300
And they,

4841
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:43,700
there was a one that had
like a corner building.

4842
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:44,840
It was a corner,

4843
01:53:44,841 --> 01:53:47,750
a apartment with insane views of the city.

4844
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:53,050
That's some of the most beautiful things
when you look at like a real city scape

4845
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:54,620
and it's lit at night.

4846
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:54,931
Oh yeah,

4847
01:53:54,931 --> 01:53:55,151
I see.

4848
01:53:55,151 --> 01:53:56,210
What a fucking amazing,

4849
01:53:56,211 --> 01:53:58,190
I just think that the numbers of people,

4850
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:59,840
when you're in a place like Manhattan,

4851
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:00,410
the,

4852
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:01,940
all the influence they have over you,

4853
01:54:01,941 --> 01:54:03,410
all the people around you all the time.

4854
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:06,080
I just don't think you
can have real piece there.

4855
01:54:06,081 --> 01:54:06,950
I don't think you can relax.

4856
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:08,740
Well that's what's crazy
is when I was living there,

4857
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:08,860
uh,

4858
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:09,561
and those stance,

4859
01:54:09,561 --> 01:54:11,920
like I remember coming home
one weekend and I lent,

4860
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:15,110
we have a house here and I remember
hearing a bird chirping outside.

4861
01:54:15,110 --> 01:54:15,321
I was like,

4862
01:54:15,321 --> 01:54:20,321
I have not heard a bird chirp except
for your was he's got a bird chirping.

4863
01:54:20,691 --> 01:54:24,290
He's got the alarms or noise of the
bird chirp or that the chirps different

4864
01:54:24,291 --> 01:54:25,160
different noises.

4865
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:25,671
No,

4866
01:54:25,671 --> 01:54:29,330
but New York is New York is great to
visit and party and stuff and even the way

4867
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:30,551
it goes back to the weather,

4868
01:54:30,551 --> 01:54:33,170
it's like I had the craziest
experiences in New York where I'm like,

4869
01:54:33,530 --> 01:54:33,681
oh,

4870
01:54:33,681 --> 01:54:34,700
it's a sunny day.

4871
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:35,990
I walk into a meeting,

4872
01:54:35,991 --> 01:54:37,790
I walk out and it's pouring rain.

4873
01:54:37,791 --> 01:54:38,061
I'm like,

4874
01:54:38,061 --> 01:54:38,900
what the hell happened?

4875
01:54:38,901 --> 01:54:40,130
And it's hot and humid.

4876
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:41,610
That's most of the world.

4877
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:43,000
Most of the world has
to deal with weather.

4878
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:43,250
Yeah.

4879
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:46,790
I have to deal with whether we just have
to deal with the once a decade or two,

4880
01:54:46,850 --> 01:54:50,090
the way the world moves
and shit falls down.

4881
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:52,880
They just sold the father
of the bride house.

4882
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,530
I'm going to remember the
movie father of the bride,

4883
01:54:54,531 --> 01:54:55,490
but does this huge,

4884
01:54:55,491 --> 01:54:56,890
really nice house.

4885
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:57,933
He was in that movie,

4886
01:54:58,250 --> 01:54:59,300
Steve Martin,

4887
01:54:59,301 --> 01:54:59,691
you know,

4888
01:54:59,691 --> 01:55:02,330
and he was like the father
of the bride and uh,

4889
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:03,260
Rick Moran is,

4890
01:55:03,261 --> 01:55:04,730
I think it might've been
in or something like that,

4891
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:08,590
but I just saw that house for sale on
some website the other day for say.

4892
01:55:08,591 --> 01:55:08,960
And I was like,

4893
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:12,800
that would be the most ideal house in
California cause it was actually picked

4894
01:55:12,801 --> 01:55:15,710
for the movie because of how
wholesome in Nice it looked.

4895
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:16,931
Where was it?

4896
01:55:16,931 --> 01:55:17,900
Where was it was in Malibu.

4897
01:55:17,910 --> 01:55:21,830
Where was gonna say was like
in my Pasadena or something.

4898
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:22,310
We are still,

4899
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:25,130
we're Martin short plays like a
gay wedding direct gay wedding.

4900
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:26,090
Yeah,

4901
01:55:26,090 --> 01:55:27,770
like a German gay wedding.

4902
01:55:27,771 --> 01:55:28,700
He's actually very funny.

4903
01:55:28,730 --> 01:55:29,500
When I was leaving,

4904
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:29,690
uh,

4905
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:31,040
Kevin Smith's place today,

4906
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:31,460
uh,

4907
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:33,980
I did his podcast this morning
and when I was leaving this place,

4908
01:55:33,981 --> 01:55:36,350
they had one of those
tours where there's a,

4909
01:55:36,380 --> 01:55:38,540
like a bus that doesn't have a top to it.

4910
01:55:38,930 --> 01:55:42,830
People were out in the open air and there
there is a star sightings and they're

4911
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,340
driving through the Hollywood

4912
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:46,170
hills pointing out celebrities houses.

4913
01:55:46,580 --> 01:55:47,311
I got fucked.

4914
01:55:47,311 --> 01:55:47,731
Is that,

4915
01:55:47,731 --> 01:55:49,920
that is when you show
people while you sleep.

4916
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:50,813
That's weird.

4917
01:55:51,190 --> 01:55:51,721
That's weird.

4918
01:55:51,721 --> 01:55:52,291
In general.

4919
01:55:52,291 --> 01:55:52,501
Like,

4920
01:55:52,501 --> 01:55:52,921
I don't know,

4921
01:55:52,921 --> 01:55:53,580
like I've,

4922
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:55,800
I've done a few tours in my life.

4923
01:55:55,801 --> 01:55:56,250
Like what?

4924
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:57,270
Even if it's like at a,

4925
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:57,720
at a,

4926
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:58,590
like a museum,

4927
01:55:58,620 --> 01:55:58,921
I guess.

4928
01:55:58,921 --> 01:56:00,090
So bored so fast.

4929
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:00,750
I'm like,

4930
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:03,750
I don't need to spend an hour for you
to tell me about this painting and the

4931
01:56:03,751 --> 01:56:04,441
painter and the,

4932
01:56:04,441 --> 01:56:05,530
I just read five minute,

4933
01:56:05,531 --> 01:56:06,364
move on,

4934
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:08,910
much less sit in the
fucking van and be like,

4935
01:56:08,911 --> 01:56:09,151
Oh,

4936
01:56:09,151 --> 01:56:09,811
Kevin Smith.

4937
01:56:09,811 --> 01:56:11,040
Luke also lives here.

4938
01:56:11,250 --> 01:56:11,551
I'm like,

4939
01:56:11,551 --> 01:56:13,710
get me off this fucking
bus for some people,

4940
01:56:13,711 --> 01:56:13,921
man.

4941
01:56:13,921 --> 01:56:15,570
Meeting celebrities is very important.

4942
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:16,051
It's,

4943
01:56:16,051 --> 01:56:17,190
we're excited about it.

4944
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:18,330
It's weird.

4945
01:56:18,330 --> 01:56:18,810
Yeah.

4946
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:21,680
You must be fucking huge
in the Persian community.

4947
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:22,523
Well that's what,

4948
01:56:22,610 --> 01:56:22,830
well,

4949
01:56:22,830 --> 01:56:23,251
it's weird.

4950
01:56:23,251 --> 01:56:23,521
I like,

4951
01:56:23,521 --> 01:56:23,731
you know,

4952
01:56:23,731 --> 01:56:24,330
in terms of,

4953
01:56:24,330 --> 01:56:24,541
yeah,

4954
01:56:24,541 --> 01:56:24,921
I mean the,

4955
01:56:24,921 --> 01:56:28,170
the Persian community like
knows me as a celebrity.

4956
01:56:28,170 --> 01:56:28,891
It's actually funny.

4957
01:56:28,891 --> 01:56:29,580
I just,

4958
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:30,181
I was just in,

4959
01:56:30,181 --> 01:56:31,014
um,

4960
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:32,280
I was at a lax,

4961
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:33,030
uh,

4962
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:36,330
two days ago and had all these like
flight problems and we're running around

4963
01:56:36,331 --> 01:56:39,090
from southwest trying to get to
American Airlines and coming back.

4964
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:39,991
And then I,

4965
01:56:39,991 --> 01:56:40,261
you know,

4966
01:56:40,261 --> 01:56:41,640
I got the Google alerts,

4967
01:56:41,641 --> 01:56:42,850
so like it sends me like if,

4968
01:56:42,851 --> 01:56:44,970
if you ever get mentioned in
something like a sends you.

4969
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:45,961
So I was just like,

4970
01:56:45,961 --> 01:56:48,630
I got the Google alert and it
was like celebrity spotting.

4971
01:56:48,631 --> 01:56:49,110
It was like,

4972
01:56:49,110 --> 01:56:49,640
Huh.

4973
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:51,150
And I look it up and it's so funny,

4974
01:56:51,151 --> 01:56:51,960
somebody was like,

4975
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:53,700
Mazda Bronnie spotted at the,

4976
01:56:53,730 --> 01:56:54,660
at lax.

4977
01:56:55,090 --> 01:56:57,060
And what was even funnier though is like,

4978
01:56:57,450 --> 01:56:57,961
it's like,

4979
01:56:57,961 --> 01:56:58,201
you know,

4980
01:56:58,201 --> 01:57:01,230
like Justin Bieber has like
10,000 celebrity spottings like,

4981
01:57:01,231 --> 01:57:01,610
you know,

4982
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:04,350
so I got to celebrities like,

4983
01:57:04,351 --> 01:57:04,651
Hey,

4984
01:57:04,651 --> 01:57:06,750
I'm working my way slowly Persians,

4985
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:07,593
that person.

4986
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:08,551
Actually,

4987
01:57:08,551 --> 01:57:09,151
you know what's funny,

4988
01:57:09,151 --> 01:57:09,751
this happened to,

4989
01:57:09,751 --> 01:57:10,620
this was the weird one,

4990
01:57:10,621 --> 01:57:11,160
one time,

4991
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:11,993
um,

4992
01:57:12,110 --> 01:57:12,400
uh,

4993
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:15,270
Aaron cater and I had just done
a gig and Jordan of all places,

4994
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:15,690
whoa.

4995
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:17,550
And we flew back and we could,

4996
01:57:17,551 --> 01:57:18,310
is that like,

4997
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:19,930
it was actually really cool
with the first time we,

4998
01:57:19,970 --> 01:57:23,130
the first time we ever did
Jordan was again with me.

4999
01:57:23,131 --> 01:57:26,010
I'm at an error and we went into the
ACCC evil comedy tour out in the Middle

5000
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:27,240
East would have five countries.

5001
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:28,770
We'd like 27 shows,

5002
01:57:28,771 --> 01:57:29,371
30 days,

5003
01:57:29,371 --> 01:57:30,181
all sold out.

5004
01:57:30,181 --> 01:57:32,190
It was like his big fish in a small pond.

5005
01:57:32,191 --> 01:57:32,810
You know what I'm saying?

5006
01:57:32,810 --> 01:57:34,440
Are you allowed to talk
about anything you,

5007
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:34,920
well,

5008
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:36,090
some countries like,

5009
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:36,560
uh,

5010
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:37,590
like Lebanon,

5011
01:57:37,591 --> 01:57:40,080
they go talk about whatever you
want because the Lebanese they have,

5012
01:57:40,081 --> 01:57:41,340
they've had the very liberal,

5013
01:57:41,341 --> 01:57:42,300
they're very bay route.

5014
01:57:42,301 --> 01:57:44,190
First of all is one of the most
amazing cities in the world.

5015
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:44,911
We're going to check it out.

5016
01:57:44,911 --> 01:57:45,744
It's amazing.

5017
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:47,850
It's like the nightlife is crazy.

5018
01:57:47,851 --> 01:57:49,500
There's like no rules or regulations.

5019
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:50,070
Um,

5020
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:51,420
the women are all beautiful.

5021
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:52,230
Um,

5022
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:52,860
the,

5023
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:52,890
uh,

5024
01:57:52,890 --> 01:57:54,390
the food is delicious.

5025
01:57:54,630 --> 01:57:55,350
Uh,

5026
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:55,681
and then,

5027
01:57:55,681 --> 01:57:57,030
and then you've got like that bizarre,

5028
01:57:57,031 --> 01:57:58,950
you can go check out the
bizarre kind of thing,

5029
01:57:58,951 --> 01:57:59,281
you know,

5030
01:57:59,281 --> 01:58:00,870
and then you could go
out into the mountains.

5031
01:58:00,871 --> 01:58:01,081
I mean,

5032
01:58:01,081 --> 01:58:01,651
it's just amazing.

5033
01:58:01,651 --> 01:58:02,191
I've had great time.

5034
01:58:02,191 --> 01:58:04,680
Every time I've kind of Beirut
and you could swear on stage,

5035
01:58:04,681 --> 01:58:05,910
swear to whatever you want.

5036
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:06,301
Oh yeah.

5037
01:58:06,301 --> 01:58:06,481
Now,

5038
01:58:06,481 --> 01:58:07,260
so that's bay route.

5039
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:09,870
Then you've got the other countries where
a lot of times the promoters will say,

5040
01:58:09,871 --> 01:58:10,381
no sex,

5041
01:58:10,381 --> 01:58:10,831
no religion,

5042
01:58:10,831 --> 01:58:11,664
no politics.

5043
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:12,690
Oh yeah.

5044
01:58:12,691 --> 01:58:12,961
You're like,

5045
01:58:12,961 --> 01:58:13,051
well,

5046
01:58:13,051 --> 01:58:13,730
now stock,

5047
01:58:13,730 --> 01:58:14,100
you know,

5048
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:15,290
said that right before you go onstage.

5049
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:15,450
Oh,

5050
01:58:15,450 --> 01:58:15,631
right.

5051
01:58:15,631 --> 01:58:16,464
Yeah.

5052
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:18,780
Well the funny thing is
when they say no policies,

5053
01:58:18,781 --> 01:58:20,280
that means no local politics.

5054
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:23,430
And thank God I don't know much about
the local politics and I'm not about to

5055
01:58:23,431 --> 01:58:24,264
challenge,

5056
01:58:24,450 --> 01:58:24,661
you know,

5057
01:58:24,661 --> 01:58:26,820
the shape of Dubai with some,

5058
01:58:26,821 --> 01:58:27,090
you know,

5059
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:27,840
stupid shit.

5060
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:28,651
So I lay,

5061
01:58:28,651 --> 01:58:28,911
you know,

5062
01:58:28,911 --> 01:58:29,001
the,

5063
01:58:29,001 --> 01:58:29,151
you know,

5064
01:58:29,151 --> 01:58:30,480
you're allowed to make fun of America.

5065
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:31,410
You make fun of America.

5066
01:58:31,411 --> 01:58:32,250
I can make fun of Iran.

5067
01:58:32,251 --> 01:58:33,180
I used to make fun of the president,

5068
01:58:33,181 --> 01:58:33,451
Iran.

5069
01:58:33,451 --> 01:58:34,050
They loved it.

5070
01:58:34,050 --> 01:58:34,231
They,

5071
01:58:34,231 --> 01:58:35,790
if you make fun of their
neighboring country,

5072
01:58:35,791 --> 01:58:36,121
they're like,

5073
01:58:36,121 --> 01:58:37,140
that is hilarious.

5074
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:41,050
They love that.

5075
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:44,860
How close is the government
of Iran to being overthrown?

5076
01:58:45,610 --> 01:58:46,000
It's,

5077
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:46,870
that's a tough call,

5078
01:58:46,871 --> 01:58:47,111
man.

5079
01:58:47,111 --> 01:58:47,291
It's,

5080
01:58:47,291 --> 01:58:49,360
it's interesting because there's like,

5081
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:49,720
Eh,

5082
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:50,171
I mean,

5083
01:58:50,171 --> 01:58:50,830
I,

5084
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:51,910
I love politics anyway,

5085
01:58:51,911 --> 01:58:53,170
so I read up on it a lot,

5086
01:58:53,171 --> 01:58:53,411
you know,

5087
01:58:53,411 --> 01:58:53,631
and,

5088
01:58:53,631 --> 01:58:56,980
and there's so many different analysts
and it's like what it is is in Iran right

5089
01:58:56,981 --> 01:58:58,450
now it's over 75,

5090
01:58:58,451 --> 01:58:59,530
maybe 80 million people.

5091
01:58:59,531 --> 01:59:01,450
And there's a lot of young people like,

5092
01:59:01,470 --> 01:59:01,750
uh,

5093
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:02,860
like a majority of young.

5094
01:59:02,861 --> 01:59:03,170
Yeah,

5095
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:05,330
they have the Internet and
they want a modern way of life.

5096
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:06,010
Well,

5097
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:06,831
but the problem is,

5098
01:59:06,831 --> 01:59:07,880
and somebody pointed this out,

5099
01:59:07,881 --> 01:59:10,880
they were saying when the Iranian
revolution happened under the Shah,

5100
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:15,620
a lot of the people that were
in [inaudible] leadership
position under the Shah

5101
01:59:15,770 --> 01:59:17,150
had been western educated.

5102
01:59:17,210 --> 01:59:18,140
And this guy made a good point.

5103
01:59:18,141 --> 01:59:18,351
He goes,

5104
01:59:18,351 --> 01:59:19,880
so when the revolution happened,

5105
01:59:20,150 --> 01:59:21,260
they had the money and they're like,

5106
01:59:21,261 --> 01:59:21,741
screw it,

5107
01:59:21,741 --> 01:59:22,221
we're outta here.

5108
01:59:22,221 --> 01:59:23,031
They went to France,

5109
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:23,781
they went to London,

5110
01:59:23,781 --> 01:59:24,800
they came to America,

5111
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:25,761
live their life.

5112
01:59:25,761 --> 01:59:26,594
They're all good.

5113
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:30,470
The people that are running the
country now are not western educated.

5114
01:59:30,471 --> 01:59:32,240
They've been part of this revolution,

5115
01:59:32,270 --> 01:59:32,590
you know,

5116
01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:34,090
79 and they,

5117
01:59:34,091 --> 01:59:34,281
they,

5118
01:59:34,281 --> 01:59:34,521
you know,

5119
01:59:34,521 --> 01:59:35,630
so they got nowhere to go.

5120
01:59:35,850 --> 01:59:36,780
And when the,

5121
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:38,940
when the ayatollah took over,

5122
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:40,440
that was all us backed.

5123
01:59:40,441 --> 01:59:40,741
Right?

5124
01:59:40,741 --> 01:59:43,740
Like there was an issue with
the Shah when the United States,

5125
01:59:43,741 --> 01:59:45,060
was that a disagreement with the Shah.

5126
01:59:45,061 --> 01:59:48,000
So they backed the ayatollah
and got him conspiracy

5127
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:48,900
theories and the sort.

5128
01:59:48,901 --> 01:59:49,441
But I think,

5129
01:59:49,441 --> 01:59:50,490
I mean a big part of it,

5130
01:59:50,491 --> 01:59:54,030
you could go back and trace it
to actually a movement happening.

5131
01:59:54,031 --> 01:59:57,060
That was an internal movement
because what happened was the Shah,

5132
01:59:57,061 --> 01:59:57,240
okay.

5133
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:58,890
The Shaw Westernize the country a lot,

5134
01:59:59,250 --> 01:59:59,640
um,

5135
01:59:59,640 --> 01:59:59,850
and,

5136
01:59:59,850 --> 02:00:00,200
and,

5137
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,250
and had a lot of progress for the country.

5138
02:00:02,510 --> 02:00:02,910
Uh,

5139
02:00:02,910 --> 02:00:03,743
nonetheless,

5140
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:04,490
under the Shah,

5141
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:06,480
like as under any dictator in,

5142
02:00:06,481 --> 02:00:07,320
in the Middle East,

5143
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:09,630
there was still a lot of
people being persecuted.

5144
02:00:09,631 --> 02:00:11,060
Like opposition was not looked,

5145
02:00:11,070 --> 02:00:11,370
you know,

5146
02:00:11,370 --> 02:00:13,440
it was frowned upon and you
would have like these like,

5147
02:00:13,441 --> 02:00:14,730
and you had different parties,

5148
02:00:14,731 --> 02:00:16,620
you had like hit the monarchists,

5149
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:18,390
then you had like the nationalists,

5150
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:21,060
then you had the socialists and
the communists and you had the,

5151
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:21,481
you know,

5152
02:00:21,481 --> 02:00:22,261
the religious,

5153
02:00:22,261 --> 02:00:22,441
you know,

5154
02:00:22,441 --> 02:00:23,160
the Islamicists.

5155
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:26,790
So you had all these different parties
and anytime anyone would say anything or

5156
02:00:26,791 --> 02:00:28,230
criticize the Shah,

5157
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:30,090
like some dude would disappear.

5158
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:30,331
You know,

5159
02:00:30,331 --> 02:00:30,870
they had,

5160
02:00:30,870 --> 02:00:31,051
yeah,

5161
02:00:31,051 --> 02:00:31,890
there was the Savak,

5162
02:00:31,891 --> 02:00:33,180
which was the secret police.

5163
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:37,560
So there's all kinds of like intellectuals
that would like criticize them and

5164
02:00:37,561 --> 02:00:38,394
disappear.

5165
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:39,270
Um,

5166
02:00:39,270 --> 02:00:40,590
and so there was,

5167
02:00:40,591 --> 02:00:41,430
there was that going on.

5168
02:00:41,431 --> 02:00:42,510
And so eventually what happened,

5169
02:00:42,511 --> 02:00:45,810
like the Khomeini's history goes
that he was actually exiled.

5170
02:00:46,020 --> 02:00:47,040
I lucky I said that by the way,

5171
02:00:47,130 --> 02:00:48,730
was the homie Romania,

5172
02:00:49,030 --> 02:00:49,863
Romania.

5173
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:50,700
Yeah.

5174
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:52,290
I'm trying to get my son to learn Farsi.

5175
02:00:52,291 --> 02:00:53,011
It's the funniest thing.

5176
02:00:53,011 --> 02:00:53,641
Seen this kid.

5177
02:00:53,641 --> 02:00:55,230
He's got like an American
accent already and he's like,

5178
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:55,880
yeah,

5179
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:56,251
he's three.

5180
02:00:56,251 --> 02:00:56,551
He'll be like,

5181
02:00:56,551 --> 02:00:56,820
come on,

5182
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:56,881
are,

5183
02:00:56,881 --> 02:00:57,150
you know,

5184
02:00:57,150 --> 02:00:57,983
he fucks it up.

5185
02:00:58,560 --> 02:00:59,100
Anyway,

5186
02:00:59,100 --> 02:00:59,671
so he,

5187
02:00:59,671 --> 02:01:00,060
um,

5188
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:02,160
Khomeini had been exiled to Iraq,

5189
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:03,240
um,

5190
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:04,200
and uh,

5191
02:01:04,201 --> 02:01:08,160
and he was getting back then it was
kinda like the Twitter of today.

5192
02:01:08,370 --> 02:01:08,820
He was,

5193
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:09,481
he would sneak,

5194
02:01:09,481 --> 02:01:13,560
he would sneak his sermons back
into Iran with tape cassettes.

5195
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:16,260
So all these other religious guys,

5196
02:01:16,261 --> 02:01:16,501
there was a,

5197
02:01:16,501 --> 02:01:16,830
there's a,

5198
02:01:16,830 --> 02:01:18,120
there's a city named comb,

5199
02:01:18,121 --> 02:01:19,920
which is a religious city in Iran.

5200
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:23,850
They were all getting like his sermons
and he was criticizing the Shah from

5201
02:01:23,851 --> 02:01:24,990
outside of Iran.

5202
02:01:24,991 --> 02:01:26,190
You can do that from outside,

5203
02:01:26,191 --> 02:01:28,740
but you can't do it from
inside Susan from outside.

5204
02:01:29,010 --> 02:01:32,730
And basically what happened was there was
all these different oppositions to the

5205
02:01:32,731 --> 02:01:36,510
Shah and discontent was growing
and protests were growing.

5206
02:01:36,780 --> 02:01:38,670
And so these guys all
kind of banded together.

5207
02:01:38,671 --> 02:01:39,411
And what they do is,

5208
02:01:39,411 --> 02:01:42,020
it's very similar to the protests that
were happening during the green movement

5209
02:01:42,021 --> 02:01:44,750
of 2009 where people would
be out protesting and then,

5210
02:01:44,990 --> 02:01:45,680
and then,

5211
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:45,951
uh,

5212
02:01:45,951 --> 02:01:48,500
the government was shooting to
the crowds and kill some people.

5213
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:49,580
And in the,

5214
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:51,380
in the Muslim Shiite religion,

5215
02:01:51,410 --> 02:01:55,310
like once someone's killed like something
like seven days after some of these

5216
02:01:55,310 --> 02:01:55,311
like a morning day,

5217
02:01:55,311 --> 02:01:55,461
like,

5218
02:01:55,461 --> 02:01:56,660
so they all go out and they mourn.

5219
02:01:56,930 --> 02:01:58,370
So these guys would be morning and the,

5220
02:01:58,430 --> 02:02:02,870
and the Shah's police would show up and
shoot some more and it just grew and

5221
02:02:02,871 --> 02:02:03,411
grew and grew.

5222
02:02:03,411 --> 02:02:05,090
So the protests were originally like,

5223
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:06,283
you know,

5224
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:07,310
one faction,

5225
02:02:07,610 --> 02:02:09,560
but then it became more
factions and then you,

5226
02:02:09,650 --> 02:02:13,520
then you got to a point where you had
like lawyers and doctors protesting in the

5227
02:02:13,521 --> 02:02:14,450
streets of Iran,

5228
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:16,520
like people that should
be supporting the regime.

5229
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:17,960
And then you had the Bazaaris,

5230
02:02:17,990 --> 02:02:18,591
they run the,

5231
02:02:18,591 --> 02:02:19,950
the bazaar is like the,

5232
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:21,020
the economy.

5233
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:23,000
These guys shut down the economy,

5234
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:24,710
the oil company went on strike.

5235
02:02:24,711 --> 02:02:27,170
So all this shit came together and then,

5236
02:02:27,171 --> 02:02:29,210
and then it costs with
the revolution to happen.

5237
02:02:29,211 --> 02:02:31,460
And I have a friend of mine
who was young back then.

5238
02:02:31,461 --> 02:02:32,570
He said what was interesting,

5239
02:02:32,571 --> 02:02:35,000
he goes like when the Shah left,

5240
02:02:35,001 --> 02:02:35,331
he goes,

5241
02:02:35,331 --> 02:02:37,610
for the first few days in Iran,

5242
02:02:37,611 --> 02:02:39,710
it was total euphoria
cause everyone was like,

5243
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:41,720
we got rid of America,

5244
02:02:41,930 --> 02:02:43,820
we got rid of the this influence.

5245
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:44,661
And he goes,

5246
02:02:44,661 --> 02:02:47,450
what was weird though was
cause cause for the protests,

5247
02:02:47,451 --> 02:02:48,860
all these factions were working together.

5248
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:49,970
He goes now,

5249
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,110
like one guy would be like,

5250
02:02:51,111 --> 02:02:51,231
hey,

5251
02:02:51,231 --> 02:02:52,070
we did it brother.

5252
02:02:52,071 --> 02:02:52,731
And the other guy would be like,

5253
02:02:52,731 --> 02:02:52,911
yeah,

5254
02:02:52,911 --> 02:02:53,481
we did do it.

5255
02:02:53,481 --> 02:02:54,230
Comrade.

5256
02:02:54,230 --> 02:02:54,591
He'd be like,

5257
02:02:54,591 --> 02:02:55,760
wait a minute brother,

5258
02:02:55,761 --> 02:02:56,410
he's a Muslim,

5259
02:02:56,410 --> 02:02:57,710
Islam is Conrad.

5260
02:02:57,711 --> 02:02:58,610
I'm a communist.

5261
02:02:58,940 --> 02:03:01,770
And then they would start turning on
each other and then the shift start

5262
02:03:01,771 --> 02:03:02,541
attorney and then,

5263
02:03:02,541 --> 02:03:05,360
and then the Islam is took over
and now we're in the shit we're in.

5264
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:06,770
But all that stuff,

5265
02:03:06,771 --> 02:03:07,371
by the way,

5266
02:03:07,371 --> 02:03:07,980
in a,

5267
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:09,950
in a lot of people have talked about this,

5268
02:03:10,190 --> 02:03:11,690
a lot of this stuff did happen.

5269
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:12,500
Uh,

5270
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:13,670
like in 53,

5271
02:03:13,671 --> 02:03:15,800
there was a democratically
elected government,

5272
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:16,101
uh,

5273
02:03:16,101 --> 02:03:16,341
the,

5274
02:03:16,341 --> 02:03:17,810
the guy was named Mosad debt.

5275
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:19,190
And the US,

5276
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:19,521
actually,

5277
02:03:19,521 --> 02:03:23,600
the CIA has written their story of
how they did a coup d'etat of the

5278
02:03:23,601 --> 02:03:25,940
democratically elected leader in Iran.

5279
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:28,250
They overthrew him and put the Shah in.

5280
02:03:28,850 --> 02:03:30,440
And so like whenever any American,

5281
02:03:30,441 --> 02:03:32,450
like whenever we talk about
wars and stuff and they're like,

5282
02:03:32,451 --> 02:03:33,590
we're just trying to bring democracy.

5283
02:03:33,591 --> 02:03:33,861
I'm like,

5284
02:03:33,861 --> 02:03:34,311
motherfucker,

5285
02:03:34,311 --> 02:03:36,710
they was democracy and we overthrew it.

5286
02:03:36,711 --> 02:03:37,910
You've got to read your history.

5287
02:03:38,590 --> 02:03:39,423
You know,

5288
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:43,220
it's a fascinating time that we live in
when people talk about going to war with

5289
02:03:43,221 --> 02:03:44,054
Iran too,

5290
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:44,481
you know,

5291
02:03:44,481 --> 02:03:46,040
when they're talking about disarming them,

5292
02:03:46,041 --> 02:03:48,080
if they continue with
their nuclear program.

5293
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:48,950
Oh yeah.

5294
02:03:48,950 --> 02:03:49,730
Oh yes.

5295
02:03:49,730 --> 02:03:50,511
Strange Times,

5296
02:03:50,511 --> 02:03:51,170
you know?

5297
02:03:51,170 --> 02:03:51,321
Yeah.

5298
02:03:51,321 --> 02:03:52,370
Well Israel is like,

5299
02:03:52,371 --> 02:03:52,611
I mean,

5300
02:03:52,611 --> 02:03:53,090
they,

5301
02:03:53,090 --> 02:03:53,660
they,

5302
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:54,381
they say like,

5303
02:03:54,381 --> 02:03:55,011
if these guys get,

5304
02:03:55,011 --> 02:03:57,110
I mean the Israelis did that to the Iraqi,

5305
02:03:57,140 --> 02:03:57,561
uh,

5306
02:03:57,561 --> 02:03:58,394
um,

5307
02:03:58,460 --> 02:04:02,530
to one of the Iraqi facilities back
in the day where they infiltrate in a,

5308
02:04:02,531 --> 02:04:02,870
in a,

5309
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:03,770
in a bombed it.

5310
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:05,203
But I guess,

5311
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:05,790
do you ever,

5312
02:04:05,790 --> 02:04:07,790
ever listened to George
Galloway speak every,

5313
02:04:07,791 --> 02:04:08,070
you know,

5314
02:04:08,070 --> 02:04:08,903
who knows?

5315
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:11,030
I think he's like a British name.

5316
02:04:11,031 --> 02:04:11,830
He's a pretty champion.

5317
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:12,340
You've got to listen to.

5318
02:04:12,340 --> 02:04:13,160
The guy's really,

5319
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:17,450
he's actually very well educated and
he'd make some good arguments and he's,

5320
02:04:17,451 --> 02:04:18,290
and it's almost like,

5321
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:19,430
it's funny how he,

5322
02:04:19,431 --> 02:04:21,230
like I've seen him get in debates with,

5323
02:04:21,650 --> 02:04:22,071
with,

5324
02:04:22,071 --> 02:04:22,310
uh,

5325
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:22,790
like,

5326
02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:23,150
uh,

5327
02:04:23,150 --> 02:04:24,170
TV commentators,

5328
02:04:24,171 --> 02:04:25,430
like on Sky TV.

5329
02:04:25,770 --> 02:04:28,220
He just like destroy annihilates them.

5330
02:04:28,250 --> 02:04:28,970
What's his name again?

5331
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:30,110
George Galloway.

5332
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:30,930
There was,

5333
02:04:30,930 --> 02:04:31,400
um,

5334
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:32,420
so he was talking about,

5335
02:04:32,421 --> 02:04:32,631
I think,

5336
02:04:32,631 --> 02:04:34,250
I think it was him that
was talking about like,

5337
02:04:34,251 --> 02:04:35,600
somebody came on,

5338
02:04:35,601 --> 02:04:36,680
he was talking about this whole,

5339
02:04:36,810 --> 02:04:37,080
you know,

5340
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:37,980
possibly doing,

5341
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:38,843
um,

5342
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:39,091
you know,

5343
02:04:39,091 --> 02:04:40,590
strategic bombings,

5344
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:41,341
what's it called,

5345
02:04:41,341 --> 02:04:42,300
surgical bombings.

5346
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:43,680
And he was like,

5347
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:44,790
t Iran is,

5348
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:45,090
uh,

5349
02:04:45,090 --> 02:04:45,361
you know,

5350
02:04:45,361 --> 02:04:47,580
some of these cities are densely
populated cities and he's like,

5351
02:04:47,581 --> 02:04:50,760
some of these facilities
are in bunkers that are,

5352
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:51,640
you know,

5353
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:52,050
you know,

5354
02:04:52,050 --> 02:04:54,600
miles down on underneath the ground.

5355
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:55,021
And he's like,

5356
02:04:55,021 --> 02:04:57,780
how are you going to do
strategic surgical bombing?

5357
02:04:58,110 --> 02:04:58,321
You know,

5358
02:04:58,321 --> 02:05:00,960
you have to drop like a nuclear
bomb on the thing to blow it up.

5359
02:05:00,961 --> 02:05:01,381
So he's like,

5360
02:05:01,381 --> 02:05:02,214
you're out of your mind,

5361
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:02,791
but,

5362
02:05:02,791 --> 02:05:03,301
but you should,

5363
02:05:03,301 --> 02:05:04,470
but you should check out George Galloway.

5364
02:05:04,471 --> 02:05:06,120
He did a thing where it was,

5365
02:05:06,121 --> 02:05:08,670
it was around the time when Israel and uh,

5366
02:05:08,671 --> 02:05:11,910
and the Lebanese were
fighting like a few years ago.

5367
02:05:12,150 --> 02:05:13,080
And this one girl,

5368
02:05:13,081 --> 02:05:14,250
it was funny from Sky News,

5369
02:05:14,251 --> 02:05:18,010
like they get like this pretty commentator
so she's like here to defend the

5370
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:18,930
Lebanese,

5371
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:19,320
you know the,

5372
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:19,441
the,

5373
02:05:19,441 --> 02:05:20,940
his bull us point of view,

5374
02:05:21,210 --> 02:05:23,220
George Galloway and the
guy rips into is like,

5375
02:05:23,221 --> 02:05:23,881
first of all,

5376
02:05:23,881 --> 02:05:24,061
you know,

5377
02:05:24,061 --> 02:05:24,560
he's got like,

5378
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:25,260
he's like,

5379
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:25,501
you know,

5380
02:05:25,501 --> 02:05:25,741
your,

5381
02:05:25,741 --> 02:05:26,041
your,

5382
02:05:26,041 --> 02:05:28,680
your introduction of me was
very biased from the Duh,

5383
02:05:28,681 --> 02:05:28,921
Duh Duh.

5384
02:05:28,921 --> 02:05:31,650
Of course I would expect it to
sky news owned by Rupert Murdoch.

5385
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:32,400
He just goes,

5386
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:33,131
it just cuts into it.

5387
02:05:33,131 --> 02:05:33,630
And he's like,

5388
02:05:33,630 --> 02:05:34,081
secondly,

5389
02:05:34,081 --> 02:05:35,160
you need to know your history.

5390
02:05:35,310 --> 02:05:35,551
He's like,

5391
02:05:35,551 --> 02:05:36,560
they'd been fighting for did it.

5392
02:05:36,561 --> 02:05:39,210
And he just goes into it and
you see this like blonde girl.

5393
02:05:39,211 --> 02:05:40,044
Like

5394
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:42,090
could you answer the question
and is he an Irish guy?

5395
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:43,033
I think he's Irish.

5396
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:44,670
I have heard this guy.

5397
02:05:44,671 --> 02:05:45,690
The dude is like,

5398
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:46,590
when it comes to arguing,

5399
02:05:46,591 --> 02:05:47,011
he's pretty,

5400
02:05:47,011 --> 02:05:49,260
he's a pretty bad mother fucker
when it comes to arguing.

5401
02:05:49,290 --> 02:05:49,441
Well,

5402
02:05:49,441 --> 02:05:50,810
I'll check out some of his stuff on.

5403
02:05:50,830 --> 02:05:51,001
I'm,

5404
02:05:51,001 --> 02:05:51,201
I'm,

5405
02:05:51,201 --> 02:05:52,590
I'm fascinated by the Middle East,

5406
02:05:52,591 --> 02:05:54,930
especially right now because
we're at such a strange time,

5407
02:05:55,170 --> 02:05:55,381
you know,

5408
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:56,460
with the Internet and you know,

5409
02:05:56,490 --> 02:06:01,490
they're using Facebook to organize and
basically overthrow government after

5410
02:06:02,551 --> 02:06:05,460
government and then they keep
toppling one after the other.

5411
02:06:05,461 --> 02:06:05,850
And um,

5412
02:06:05,850 --> 02:06:07,440
I'm curious as to what
we're actually seeing.

5413
02:06:07,490 --> 02:06:07,731
You know,

5414
02:06:07,731 --> 02:06:08,481
the problem is,

5415
02:06:08,481 --> 02:06:08,731
it's,

5416
02:06:08,731 --> 02:06:10,520
it's funny because if you
talk to a lot of Iranians,

5417
02:06:10,521 --> 02:06:11,061
we always say like,

5418
02:06:11,061 --> 02:06:11,511
for example,

5419
02:06:11,511 --> 02:06:12,500
like what happened,

5420
02:06:12,501 --> 02:06:13,280
what happened in Egypt?

5421
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:15,950
It's like it was a positive
step in the right direction.

5422
02:06:15,951 --> 02:06:16,784
But the question is,

5423
02:06:17,030 --> 02:06:18,440
talk to me six months from now,

5424
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:20,430
talking about a year from
now because we'll be,

5425
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:20,970
you know,

5426
02:06:20,970 --> 02:06:23,980
well the people that are alive today
even benefit from it or does that make

5427
02:06:23,981 --> 02:06:24,910
their life shittier?

5428
02:06:24,911 --> 02:06:27,550
And then the next generation
benefits the worlds.

5429
02:06:27,551 --> 02:06:29,290
And I'm a fucking turmoil right now.

5430
02:06:29,291 --> 02:06:30,220
I don't understand it.

5431
02:06:30,221 --> 02:06:31,630
I don't understand economics.

5432
02:06:31,631 --> 02:06:33,680
When people start talking
about economic meltdowns,

5433
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:34,840
it's to me,

5434
02:06:35,230 --> 02:06:36,011
the way I look at it,

5435
02:06:36,011 --> 02:06:36,640
I go,

5436
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:37,361
at the end of the day,

5437
02:06:37,361 --> 02:06:38,410
there's the same amount of shit.

5438
02:06:38,411 --> 02:06:39,430
And there's the same amount of people.

5439
02:06:39,431 --> 02:06:40,420
So what the fuck went wrong?

5440
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:40,650
Yeah,

5441
02:06:40,650 --> 02:06:44,410
we were living like kings just to a
couple of years ago and now everybody's

5442
02:06:44,411 --> 02:06:46,930
fucking in the shitter because of what?

5443
02:06:46,931 --> 02:06:48,950
Because of an inflated
economy and like what?

5444
02:06:49,230 --> 02:06:49,840
What does that mean?

5445
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:52,450
I'm part of the things that I'm starting
to see that that makes some sense to me

5446
02:06:52,451 --> 02:06:52,810
cause he right.

5447
02:06:52,810 --> 02:06:54,550
I I a lot of times get lost in it all too.

5448
02:06:54,551 --> 02:06:56,590
But some of the things that started
making sense is when they talked to start

5449
02:06:56,591 --> 02:07:00,190
talking about like the difference between
the haves and the have nots and like

5450
02:07:00,191 --> 02:07:01,360
how like back in the day,

5451
02:07:01,361 --> 02:07:04,540
like a CEO average would
make like 20 times more than,

5452
02:07:04,541 --> 02:07:05,290
uh,

5453
02:07:05,290 --> 02:07:05,740
than,

5454
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:06,431
than the worker.

5455
02:07:06,431 --> 02:07:10,000
Now that some of these CEO's are making
like 350 times more than the average

5456
02:07:10,001 --> 02:07:10,331
worker.

5457
02:07:10,331 --> 02:07:10,961
So you start going,

5458
02:07:10,961 --> 02:07:11,261
okay,

5459
02:07:11,261 --> 02:07:11,890
I see.

5460
02:07:11,890 --> 02:07:15,370
Like right now they're saying that
a lot of these banks have made them,

5461
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:17,110
like they weren't affected by the,

5462
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:17,620
by,

5463
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:19,990
by the economic crunch
cause we bailed them out.

5464
02:07:19,991 --> 02:07:22,750
And now a lot of these bankers
are making a lot more money.

5465
02:07:22,751 --> 02:07:24,400
And yet the economy is
supposedly still bad.

5466
02:07:24,401 --> 02:07:26,110
And people that had mortgages that were,

5467
02:07:26,111 --> 02:07:26,411
you know,

5468
02:07:26,411 --> 02:07:27,670
belly up or still belly up

5469
02:07:28,430 --> 02:07:31,070
money in and of itself
is so strange to me.

5470
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:34,040
The idea that it's based on nothing
but confidence now there's no,

5471
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:35,310
it's not gold back.

5472
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:36,160
Yeah.

5473
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:36,790
He's just like,

5474
02:07:36,790 --> 02:07:37,240
it's so,

5475
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:39,580
it's so hard to pay
attention to everything.

5476
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:42,160
There's just too much shit
going on in the world.

5477
02:07:42,580 --> 02:07:45,430
There's too many God damn experiments
going on is too many new science

5478
02:07:45,490 --> 02:07:47,620
inventions that I have
to look at every day.

5479
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:52,210
There's some new one they invented where
they installed some micro chip into a

5480
02:07:52,211 --> 02:07:55,690
rat's brain and the rat recovered lost
memories and they're thinking they're

5481
02:07:55,691 --> 02:07:57,370
gonna eventually be able
to do this to people.

5482
02:07:57,510 --> 02:07:59,320
It's just so much fucking shit going on.

5483
02:07:59,590 --> 02:08:00,970
I can't pay attention to everything.

5484
02:08:00,971 --> 02:08:01,750
It's impossible.

5485
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:02,230
Yeah.

5486
02:08:02,230 --> 02:08:02,501
No,

5487
02:08:02,501 --> 02:08:02,771
it is.

5488
02:08:02,771 --> 02:08:03,161
It's pretty,

5489
02:08:03,161 --> 02:08:04,840
it's pretty overwhelming sometimes.

5490
02:08:05,230 --> 02:08:07,840
It's a crazy world we live in and we
got a tweet in the middle of all that.

5491
02:08:07,841 --> 02:08:08,674
You've got to tweet,

5492
