1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,570
Do you stream with your which are 
problems ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:08,060
I present to you the lovely and talented
Mr Sam triply Santra.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,140
Gentlemen,
privilege man.

4
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:15,141
Thanks for having me here.
Do I do love how you're wearing 

5
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:15,141
sunglasses inside?
I'm going to do it for you.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,120
You don't have this slight shift.
Black people only be able to do it.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,440
I want to rock that.
Yeah.

8
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:20,850
Why?
Why can they do it?

9
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:23,760
So you're broadcasting right now,
right?

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,120
Aren't we?
So as we're broadcasting does not show 

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,120
up on ustream.
Yeah,

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,900
for me,
I don't dare you.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,860
Let's try it again.
Might be a little slow today.

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,420
Ustream,
is it blogging?

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,120
We have a problem.
There we go.

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,890
Good.
Okay.

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,220
Yep,
we're good.

18
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,860
Okay.
So it was a,

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,940
it was a total false alarm.
Ladies and gentlemen,

20
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,740
we have sunglasses on.
Why?

21
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,770
Because Sam triple,
he showed up with sunglasses and the 

22
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:54,900
adult respect.
I'm going to follow suit.

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,930
Let's do it.
I've never done a show with sunglasses 

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:00:59,930
on.
Let's do it well.

25
00:00:59,930 --> 00:00:59,930
So what is it about black?
Oh,

26
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,461
before we even get started and we knew I
needed to get a new one at these 

27
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,810
flashlights.
By the way,

28
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:07,370
Joe.
Uh,

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,540
I think I'm using my fucking the shit 
out of yours.

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,630
I don't know if I'm not cleaning it well
enough.

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,590
This is the one I fucked.
So you don't want to touch this one.

32
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:17,280
We really fucked.
That doesn't feel real.

33
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,130
I think it's a computer technology to 
really fuck that.

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,740
Fuck the Shit Outta my cat.
Wants to get out man.

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,930
But I let my cat out too.

36
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,760
While you were up.
There's too many people in there.

37
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:40,290
She's freaking out here.
That's how we roll.

38
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:45,291
Ladies and gentlemen.
Some people that work out of a 

39
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:45,291
professional studio in Hollywood.
Me,

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,360
I got computers that are always on.
I got a cat that wants to get out of my 

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,600
office.
She does too.

42
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:52,830
Girl.
Don't insult their brother.

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,920
That's before we get started.
Doctor fucked one of these.

44
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:00,910
I'll get to know a bunch of dogs.
You ever on these dude?

45
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,520
It's,
of course you'd beat off.

46
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,760
We all do.
When you know dies with functional army 

47
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:07,760
and,
and Dick's attached.

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,750
We all beat off and this is way better 
than beating.

49
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,660
Really?
Yes,

50
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:15,450
it's way better.
We are actually sponsored by them,

51
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:18,540
but even if I wasn't sponsored by them,
I would tell you to fuck this thing.

52
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,210
Are you telling me that they're better 
enough?

53
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,390
My hand way better,
way better because your hand,

54
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:26,910
you always this,
you're getting,

55
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,960
oh,
you're still getting like a signal from 

56
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,040
your Dick,
but your hand signal from your hand that

57
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:32,970
you're holding a dick.

58
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,420
You know what I'm saying?
It's like you're doing it to yourself 

59
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,420
and even though you know exactly what 
you like,

60
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,040
you know you're not gonna.
Get the same feeling as if someone else 

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,591
was doing it to you or if you're 
actually fucking something that's 

62
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:47,761
amazing.
This is the next best thing to having 

63
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:47,761
sex.
I'm telling you,

64
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:50,481
dude,
it's the best masturbation device for 

65
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:53,331
the male ever created.
It feels like you're fucking law upkeep 

66
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:53,331
though,
Dude.

67
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:55,590
You squirt some lube in it.
You fuck it.

68
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,380
You shoot your load,
you uncork the bottom.

69
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,010
This disgusting Snot ball of shame comes
out like the spit valve and the trumpet.

70
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,580
Dump your load out.
Then you stick this in the faucet,

71
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:08,110
clean the fucking shit so you don't 
pull.

72
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,670
Don't pull the fish out of the bucket at
all.

73
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,560
You can.
I do.

74
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,840
I pull the fish out of the bucket anyway
with Brian logins or Japanese Americans 

75
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:17,930
got dammit where I'm like,
yeah,

76
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,320
but by the way,
what Brian means by pull the fish out of

77
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:20,770
the bucket.

78
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,710
This is what Brian means.
This is his patented move.

79
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,130
He says that this.
She just hooked that up to the back of 

80
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,560
your faucet,
or are you good?

81
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,340
It's a very controversial thing.
This flashlight.

82
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,210
It's a very controversial subject.
Sex Toys and I don't think it should be.

83
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:40,480
I think fucking dumb.
It's a biological maintenance thing,

84
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,100
you know?
That's what masturbation,

85
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:47,101
as you know,
people think about it somehow or 

86
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,431
another,
still like for something dirty to it 

87
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:49,431
like that.
This,

88
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:49,431
you know,
rubber thing that you stick your Dick in

89
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:50,920
because somehow or another this would be
bad.

90
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:55,921
You know,
what sucks about that is when you have 

91
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:57,571
your married friends over for a nice 
drink or two and it's laying around and 

92
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,920
you accidentally leave it in the 
bathroom and not only do you leave it in

93
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:01,360
the bathroom with like with the lid 
open,

94
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:03,340
so it's just this pussy while he's 
taking a Piss,

95
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,170
there was like a pubic hair on it of 
course.

96
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,800
And he came out and didn't say a word 
and then I went to the bathroom a couple

97
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,500
minutes later.
I'm like,

98
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:09,670
oh,
he didn't even say anything,

99
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,500
you know,
like going to like keep it to himself.

100
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,110
Like don't maybe just assumes you're 
afraid.

101
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,540
Maybe hit it,
but it wouldn't tell you about him being

102
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,490
married though.
Huh?

103
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:17,850
What?
You know,

104
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,800
because he was just like,
you know,

105
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,810
he's not,
he's not.

106
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,080
He's not like fucking fake pussies.
Are you wearing sunglasses?

107
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,880
Those are glasses.
No glasses.

108
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,440
I've been using the Internet too much 
lately,

109
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:28,890
so my eyes are fucking killing me.
Dude.

110
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,270
You're cooking your eyes.
Did last three days.

111
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,750
I've done nothing but surf.
The Internet on balls are getting.

112
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,430
Not,
they're not bad.

113
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:41,431
I can still read,
but they're not as good that I can 

114
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,921
definitely see a deterioration,
but I'm just assuming that's a part of 

115
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:43,921
the aging process.

116
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:46,480
I've been on youtube constantly watching
pro wrestling,

117
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,430
nonstop food,
Hulk Hogan versus the ultimate warrior.

118
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:52,750
I was like,
I watched that.

119
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:57,160
I was getting really.
You watch just because I got this right.

120
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,420
Let's talk about that before we even say
anything more.

121
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:06,421
Sam.
He has a fantastic show tomorrow night 

122
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:09,361
at the Hollywood improv.
If you've never seen the Sam triply 

123
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:13,081
naughty show.
It's not just stand up comics where he 

124
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:13,081
gets a bunch of,
you know,

125
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:15,430
really the best comics are buddies from 
La will go up and perform.

126
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:17,830
I've done a show after the show last 
month,

127
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:18,310
right?
Yeah.

128
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,590
He was murdered a Heckler,
so it was so much fun.

129
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:23,620
It's such a fun what it is though.
It's not just stand up comedy,

130
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,570
stand up comedy,
but it's a variety.

131
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,810
He's got like a variety show going on.
He has like a little game shows going 

132
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:30,810
on.
It shows video porn stars.

133
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,110
That's the main thing they get this 
week.

134
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:35,770
You have Dana,
don't you have Dana d ironman and Joanne

135
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,520
Angel.
That's great,

136
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,060
and he does this show.
It's like a comedy variety show.

137
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:45,061
Porno stars.
They do question and answer and Trivia 

138
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:48,181
type shit.
It's really fucking hilarious stuff and 

139
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,700
it's a fun evening.
It's not just like a comedy show,

140
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:51,280
which I love comedy,
but I liked that you're mixing it up.

141
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:53,320
You got comedy,
you've got a bunch of variety.

142
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,830
It really feels like a vegas show and 
that's what I said when when I first saw

143
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:57,040
it,
I was,

144
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,500
you know,
someone should recognize that and put 

145
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:02,500
this fucking thing in Vegas because I 
know you've put a lot of time and effort

146
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,320
into it.
It's really a fun show to watch.

147
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,350
Yeah,
I look forward to that.

148
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,020
My favorite part of the show is telling 
clean comic.

149
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,850
Say,
can't do it.

150
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,040
I'm sorry you were cleaned.
Can't use just like porn.

151
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,010
You what you're doing,
man.

152
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:15,380
It's,
it's.

153
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,590
You're creating this really fun party 
atmosphere.

154
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,820
You know,
that's what your show is.

155
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:22,880
It's not just a comedy show.
It's like a comedy show,

156
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:27,881
but all this stuff that's happened,
it's all fun and silly and it's like a 

157
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:28,250
great move.
If you want to get a check.

158
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,330
Horny,
right.

159
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,020
Your show is all about fucking.
Your standup is about fucking.

160
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,860
The show's all about fucking your porn 
stars up.

161
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:39,140
Everybody's having a great time.
So by the end of the night,

162
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:40,940
if you're the girl you brought,
if you,

163
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,060
you know,
if you picked her correctly when you're 

164
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,251
bringing it to the show,
she's going associate having fun with 

165
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:48,251
fucking.
She had fun with you.

166
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:50,730
I just want to throw them Pavlov's shit.
Some type shit son.

167
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,740
I'm saying that's actually my.
My crowd is more of a large part is 

168
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:55,740
women.

169
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,170
Yeah.
Oh,

170
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,590
there was a lot of chicks when we were 
there.

171
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,030
Yeah.
You have a lot of women that come.

172
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,050
It's because it's fun,
man.

173
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:05,051
It's a fun show and again,
girls I think really loved those like 

174
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:05,900
weekly,
monthly type shows.

175
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:09,350
You remember when before I'm a steel 
panther became big.

176
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,870
Weren't they a metal shop?
Is it the same band?

177
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,050
I don't know if it's the same band or 
not because I just got into them when 

178
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,050
you showed me and we went to Vegas.
Dude,

179
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,700
how much fucking fun was that?
No,

180
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,800
it was awesome.
It's more than just a music show.

181
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,960
It's like,
it's like when Steel Panther,

182
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:24,810
they do like,
uh,

183
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,410
it's,
you know,

184
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,370
it's like,
it really rekindled these eighties bands

185
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,520
that dude does like the best fucking 
Ozzie impression that and the really 

186
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,160
good musicians,
you know.

187
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,630
So the music is tight,
you know,

188
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:36,470
it's good man.

189
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,200
We're just saying we saw him in Vegas at
the House of Blues.

190
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,840
We're going to see him again because I 
think they're on after me on July 

191
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,521
second.
I think they're playing the second and 

192
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:48,521
the third.
I'm not,

193
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:48,521
I'm not sure,
but I think they are.

194
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,460
Um,
but they,

195
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,170
they were on after it.
Was that,

196
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,900
that or was it after the UFC was the 
next day?

197
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,610
I don't know.
I can't remember the next day.

198
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,460
It was after the UFC.
So we came down and we watched it.

199
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:00,830
I think it was a pretty late show,
but it's fucking awesome.

200
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:02,240
It was metal.
Copper,

201
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,810
a steel panther ruined one of my 
favorite gigs in a pub.

202
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,020
There was this place called moon doggies
and every time I did it I always got 

203
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,810
legs like weird,
weird lays too,

204
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,960
like it was awesome.
And then Steel Panther,

205
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:19,961
one of them,
they started doing it on the same night 

206
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:19,961
and then went away.

207
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:24,010
But dude,
I mean we're chicks chicks who blue cows

208
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:29,030
and stuff like that and like I'm like,
that's a female ad blue an animal.

209
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:30,020
That's all I know.
And I'm like,

210
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,210
check a balloon animal.
Really?

211
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,750
Would you like for a video?
Just for fun.

212
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,710
She balloon animal for fun.
How do you,

213
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,500
how'd you find out about this?
She told me.

214
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Wow.
That doesn't mean you don't really feel 

215
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,560
like you scored with that.
That girl's willing to suck our cows.

216
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,180
Dick.
Yeah,

217
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,460
but she's willing to do that.
What?

218
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,640
What will she let me do?
She'll let you do what you did.

219
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,780
You pretty much have full game on that.
Yeah,

220
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,680
but you don't feel like you accomplished
anything.

221
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,350
You feel like,
wow,

222
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,420
this is the lowest hanging fruit ever 
right now.

223
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,340
Let's check flux animals.
They can even talk,

224
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,410
you'll start thinking about it and like 
Lysol on your Dick and this is,

225
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,410
isn't there a certain thing like that,
like,

226
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,450
you know,
when I talk about in my act about child 

227
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,901
molesters that you have to kill him 
because you can't really bounce back 

228
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:11,901
from that.

229
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:11,901
Yeah.
It's a very funny joke.

230
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,200
When we think about that with,
with chicks,

231
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:15,660
there's a certain amount of things that 
a chick can't do,

232
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,500
you know,
in her past where you can just accept 

233
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:21,500
that she grew from that and moved on.
You know,

234
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,511
like,
like the conversation comes up about 

235
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,621
like would you be able to date a porn 
star or would you be able to date a 

236
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:27,621
prostitute?
Oh,

237
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:28,080
that would be the craziest one.
Right?

238
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,320
What if there was a girl who is a high 
end prostitute and she felt really bad 

239
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,921
about it,
but she did it for like a year and then 

240
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:38,451
she quit,
but she was the most awesome chick you 

241
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:39,991
ever met.
The back of your head is going to be 

242
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:39,991
gone,
but shit.

243
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:40,560
I mean,
I know I fucked up.

244
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:42,840
I've made mistakes.
I'm no fucking perfect person,

245
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:45,000
but God damn you were a hooker.

246
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,420
Fuck.
You know,

247
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,450
it's like you would have to be 
incredibly open minded to like watching 

248
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:55,560
their girl get bone.
But the problem with that,

249
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,090
those guys are all fucked up,
man.

250
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Those guys are just as fucked up.
They're the type of people that don't 

251
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,120
take it in the ass if given the 
opportunity.

252
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,850
One of those,
I don't want to say that they're fucked 

253
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:06,850
up.
They could just be crazy swingers.

254
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,800
But with the people that are fucked up 
or the cuckold guys,

255
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,940
the guys who like want guys to fuck the 
girl in front of the uh.

256
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:12,720
Yeah.
And like,

257
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,150
and like embarrass them and like,
do you,

258
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:20,151
have you ever met one of these people or
do you think that was just involved in 

259
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:22,860
Orange County?
Like guys who pay like large black guys.

260
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,730
I saw a picture online,
I dunno,

261
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,850
maybe Stan hope send it to me.

262
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,170
Somebody sent it to me.
Somebody fucked up,

263
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:33,171
send it to me and it's a this fucking 
guy and this girl together and the man 

264
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:36,180
is sucking this guy's Dick in front of 
the girl.

265
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,870
The black eyes making this man suck his 
dick and then he's gonna fuck the white 

266
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,070
girl and he's wearing a suit and it's 
one of the most disturbing pictures.

267
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,220
It's just something so primal and 
disturbing.

268
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,080
That's a broken dude.
Any dude who like wants to suck his dick

269
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:54,700
and then once the girl to once he's not 
even get.

270
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,720
He wants to be humiliated by this guy.
He wants to fuck his girl in front of 

271
00:10:59,720 --> 00:10:59,720
them.
Then they.

272
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,870
A lot of times they come in the guy's 
mouth.

273
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,240
Can you imagine?
How much does that guy own you?

274
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,340
He fucked your wife and then came in 
your mouth.

275
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,090
Oh my God.
You know,

276
00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:11,880
if you found out a chick used to do 
that,

277
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,410
you know what I'm saying?
Well,

278
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,060
I dated this guy.
He was crazy.

279
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,360
He used to have black guys come over and
fuck me in front of him and he would 

280
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,360
suck the black guy's Dick.
I was so uncomfortable.

281
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,750
I really wasn't into it,
but he was into it,

282
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:24,180
so we kept doing it and caught.
I'm so glad I got over that.

283
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,840
You'd be like,
what the fuck happened?

284
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,290
Wait a minute,
didn't to remember with the white guy 

285
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,071
sucked the black guys deck.
Then the black guy fucked you and then 

286
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:35,190
the black guy came in the white guy's 
mouth check please.

287
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Right?
We snowballed 20 times back and forth 

288
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:40,900
and seeing too much hooker.

289
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,870
Too much.
My dear.

290
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,990
You've got too much life experience.
I cannot handle that.

291
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,320
That's where I tap it.
But isn't there something about like 

292
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,380
having your getting your check to do 
filthy shit that's like,

293
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:55,210
it's almost like a point,
but then you kind of go,

294
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,150
this is a girl and this girl,
this girl I love.

295
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:03,151
Why am I making her do it?
What's even worse is when he wants you 

296
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:03,450
to do a tour,
they want to be humiliated.

297
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,500
You hear about girls like that want to 
be hit.

298
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,080
I want to be choking.
Thing is what gets me.

299
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,490
I dated a chick.
I want to get.

300
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,150
It was uncomfortable.
Scary.

301
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,600
You don't want associate rape with 
sexuality,

302
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:17,460
with you know,
with.

303
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,130
I mean,
you know,

304
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,080
the girl obviously knows she can trust 
you.

305
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:21,610
The girl.
I mean chicks are into it.

306
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,140
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not saying you shouldn't do it.

307
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,390
Do whatever the fuck you want.
I think as a man though,

308
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,570
the last thing you want to do is 
associate like aggressive violence with 

309
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,721
sexuality.
I don't want to connect those two in my 

310
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:33,721
head because I know people get connected
with things.

311
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:35,680
You know,
you get like fetishes come from like,

312
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:39,710
I used to have a foot fetish because I 
dated this girl who was really her feet.

313
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,560
Yeah.
She was really into her feet and she had

314
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,160
like,
you know,

315
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,190
cute feet.
She just was really into him though and 

316
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,190
she will like rub her feet on my deck 
and shit like that.

317
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,310
Crazy.
But you know,

318
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,920
and she would try to,
to like a jerk me off of her feet.

319
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,860
She was afraid.
She was afraid.

320
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:55,900
I just met somebody that like that.
She was a freak.

321
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,450
But this was when I was really young.
I was like 16,

322
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:00,580
17 and I was like one of my first 
girlfriends.

323
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,890
So I had this foot thing for awhile.
You know,

324
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,380
you connect,
you connect that with sexuality.

325
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,590
I think it's weird.
You get into connect.

326
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,010
Yeah,
maybe that's weird,

327
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:14,011
but it wasn't like I was only in feet,
like I just thought I liked girls were 

328
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:17,221
pretty feet.
But you didn't see her feet and then 

329
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:17,221
like Papa Boehner did you?
No,

330
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:17,221
no,
no,

331
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:21,061
but I thought I've found them attractive
to found the whole package attractive 

332
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:21,061
and the fact that she was really into 
it.

333
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:22,450
So you don't have a foot fetish now?
No,

334
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,160
I don't like them to be gross,
but no,

335
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:26,230
I don't have a foot fetish.
You take care of your feet,

336
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,290
see my nails,
but it's just so it doesn't scratch 

337
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:31,290
people and you just never get your feet 
done or anything like that.

338
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,210
The Fuck Outta here.
Sunday said,

339
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,940
look what you're looking at.
What are you taking?

340
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,620
Anybody to be fucking cleaning my toe.

341
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,240
No,
but once you have a job I ever had.

342
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,340
Have you ever had it done there?
No,

343
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:48,100
I don't want to do it once I said the 
same shit.

344
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:53,101
What's so special about getting your 
nail Polish feels good and it feels 

345
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:54,520
clean and once you're done you're just 
like,

346
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:57,940
wow,
I feel like this has been a feet.

347
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,110
You Lazy.
Fuck,

348
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,410
wash washcloth and stuff,
so it's like you're wiping.

349
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,900
They brought me the one to get my feet 
down.

350
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:09,901
One time I swear to God,
I walked in the all the Asian ladies 

351
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:13,330
look at me and then they run to the back
of the room behind this door and you can

352
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:16,580
just hear them arguing and then wants to
do.

353
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,450
Nobody wants Armenian walk through and 
they're like,

354
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,110
that's a long day.
I saw one of those old guys at starbucks

355
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:28,111
the other day that had like the sandals,
but his toenails were all super yellow 

356
00:14:28,111 --> 00:14:30,670
and like huge,
like curling up and then he had like all

357
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:32,710
those like scabby things all over his 
feet.

358
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,710
Like it was like drying skin and stuff.
Trim mine mostly out of courtesy for 

359
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,410
guys that Jujitsu.
Right.

360
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,270
Because it sounds gross but.
And Gay too.

361
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,330
But you scratched us with your toenails 
and Jujitsu all the time.

362
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,380
I got scratched by fingernails and 
toenails,

363
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:47,200
so I always keep my shit really,
really,

364
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:49,150
really short.
But there's guys that don't.

365
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:50,350
Man.
Sometimes you're rolling with God.

366
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:55,351
You looked down at their feet and like 
the wolf man right now and they're 

367
00:14:55,351 --> 00:14:56,120
scrambles and in scrambles.
People push and they push off their feet

368
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,740
and they can claw you up,
man.

369
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:02,741
What their toenails.
Now we're going to try to get your back 

370
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:02,741
and they're trying to get those hooks in
there,

371
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:04,520
trying to dig the hooks to get butterfly
hooks on you.

372
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,440
They could fuck you up with their toes,
man.

373
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,470
They can cut your shit up.
Is that why you haven't heard from all 

374
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,510
the scratch marks on your face?
Joe On furry son.

375
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,830
I'm trying to suck on this beard son Yo.
But going back to what you're talking 

376
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:24,911
about is a bit weird fetishes.
Don't you think that people should just 

377
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:25,970
embrace what they are and trying to 
find.

378
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,300
All was saying too that I was saying,

379
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,020
me personally,
I don't think.

380
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:35,050
I mean this is just an opinion.
I don't think it's good to connect 

381
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:35,050
violence and sex.
You know,

382
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,570
I connected feet with sex for awhile 
because of this freaky girl that had did

383
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:38,750
it.
That's another wrong with that.

384
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:43,751
No one's getting hurt.
If you connect violence when sex and 

385
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:45,050
then you get with somebody that you'd 
like and maybe she isn't into that shit,

386
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,060
you know,
maybe.

387
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,660
I mean,
let's be honest,

388
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,070
the violent sexual relationships really 
don't have a lot of fucking shelf life.

389
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,280
She gotta assume you're going to have 
another girlfriend after this one that 

390
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,140
wants you to choke her and brutalize 
macro in the head.

391
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,760
How long are you going to stay with her?
Right.

392
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,820
You know,
we're going to have kids and then like 

393
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,880
involve them into the whole man.
Obviously

394
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,270
people adapt and change and evolve.
But it's just,

395
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,490
there's something about that.
There's something about violence like 

396
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,600
attacking and sex.
There's one thing about fucking someone 

397
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,360
hard,
but it's another thing about,

398
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:17,830
you know,
when it,

399
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,570
when it becomes some sort of like a sort
of a rape thing,

400
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,160
like a rape fantasy,

401
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,830
some weird shit about rape fantasies.
That is weird.

402
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:31,070
But you know,
it's like I do a joke about that Auto 

403
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,070
Rocca fixation.
It's like my,

404
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,520
you know,
my whole thing is get a spotter.

405
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,350
You know what I'm saying?
Like get a buddy.

406
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,600
No.
Sit there when you hang yourself.

407
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:38,400
And you're whacking it and when your 
eyes roll,

408
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:41,010
they lift you up for that.
Do you know what I'm saying?

409
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,660
But because they're so scared of putting
it out there that they,

410
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,920
they hide hustling,
you know?

411
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:49,320
It would be a very good point.
You mean look,

412
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,350
think about all the shit

413
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,760
priest do.
Right?

414
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,240
And,
and somehow,

415
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,300
you know,
forgive themselves for it or justify it.

416
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,060
There was that one priest that Baptist 
minister,

417
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:04,061
very famous guy,
obviously they're not the same as 

418
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:06,011
priests,
but who he died with a black dildo up 

419
00:17:06,011 --> 00:17:10,121
his ass in a wet suit hanging because he
did the auto erotic association thing.

420
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,460
Just think of all the shit that that 
guy's willing to justify,

421
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:14,120
you know,
if you.

422
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,500
I mean,
not really.

423
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,110
That's actually a bad example because I 
said he was a bishop,

424
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,440
but hopefully they'll catch a priest 
doing the exact same thing and this will

425
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:26,441
make sense.
But this poor guy couldn't just tell 

426
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:26,441
people,
hey,

427
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:26,441
I got this crazy thing I like to do.
Man,

428
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:28,070
that's really fucked up.
I'm in the weird.

429
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,910
I don't want you to see it,
but I'm afraid I'm gonna die.

430
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,740
Yeah.
So coming to watch me beat up,

431
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,960
just sit there and spot it should be an 
iphone app where you like,

432
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,970
you hit start and if you don't like put 
in a code in like three minutes or 

433
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,180
something like that.
It caused nine slash 11 automatically so

434
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:50,181
you can choke yourself or whack off on 
what is it about people that just trip 

435
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:50,181
certain things

436
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:51,570
like that.
Like you know,

437
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,750
like they'll get into just whatever 
weird fetish at tying people up and 

438
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,480
gagging.
Um,

439
00:17:57,481 --> 00:18:02,481
and you remember our pal that used to 
like to beat his check and she still 

440
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:02,750
liked to get whipped.
Remember that he used to whip her.

441
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,090
Who?
Mr D dot.

442
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,890
Do you remember that?
You don't remember that?

443
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:13,250
We can't.
We can't say who because he dated 

444
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,250
someone famous.
All right,

445
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,960
we'll talk later.
We'll talk off.

446
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,630
There were no snitches.
Folks.

447
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,050
Snitches get stitches.
I gave it to them and cold.

448
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,120
He don't even know who the fuck I'm 
talking about.

449
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,350
I'm confused,
right?

450
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,990
We'll forget about it.
But what's head dance?

451
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,490
Just let's just try to figure out what 
the fuck it is.

452
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,520
I mean,
I know that my thing with feet was 

453
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:31,520
because I dated a girl is freaky with 
her feet.

454
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:31,810
I have a boob thing.
Definitely,

455
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,290
you know,
every guy is gonna know.

456
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:33,920
But,
but like,

457
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,830
like I always joke older girls were the 
vagina's.

458
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,190
That's what I'm doing.
I,

459
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,930
I get blinded by headlights like 
nonstop.

460
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,470
Hey,
I found that we all do.

461
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,430
I know,
but that's what I'm saying.

462
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,310
Basic Man on the face and ass man.
You know,

463
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,680
there's two totally different things 
when it comes to,

464
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,450
uh,
with breast sexuality,

465
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:59,451
what would make some sexual.
There's natural tits where you have 

466
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:02,160
conflict is a natural natural draw,
but it's just purely sexual.

467
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,890
But there's a different draw with fake 
tits,

468
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,220
with fake tits.
There's still a draw and you feel stupid

469
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:13,221
for being drawn to these stupid things 
because you know that they're really 

470
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:15,741
just bags of water underneath the skin 
and it's not the same draw from real 

471
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:16,800
tits.
But there's something,

472
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:21,801
a little extra dirty about the fake,
a little extra turn you on a bit because

473
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,340
you know this,
she's the,

474
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,140
she wants so bad.
She was like,

475
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,070
I want to make sure,
you know,

476
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:29,730
I really like that you're right.
And they could say that it's like that.

477
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:31,860
They're just trying to look attractive 
and all that good.

478
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,670
But what does that mean?

479
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,380
You want to look like somebody wants to 
fuck you.

480
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,210
You want people to really want to fuck 
you.

481
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,780
I would agree.
Unless it's one of those like,

482
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,990
no,
I just got to be because of their really

483
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:40,580
droopy,
you know?

484
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,760
But for the most part,
yeah,

485
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,470
I will.
Look,

486
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,480
there's nothing wrong with getting 
breast implants if you want to do it 

487
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:47,480
wrong.
Don't get me wrong.

488
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,180
If I was a girl,
I'd probably have,

489
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:49,290
um,
if I had a small boobs,

490
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,330
I'll get a boob job.
Fuck it.

491
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:51,710
Why not?
How about breastfeeding?

492
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:56,010
I think that's when girls is give up 
because it hurts too much because that's

493
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:57,990
the only thing I can think of.
I did a girl a long time ago.

494
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:59,820
She had,
she was just born with giant ones.

495
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:01,530
She had a breast reduction before I met 
her.

496
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,820
She was so happy though because for her,
like her back used to fucking killer.

497
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,190
She had these giant ease,
a natural ease.

498
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:08,550
Wow.

499
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,570
I actually have a family member I've 
been in.

500
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,590
I've said that novela was right.
I have a friend that,

501
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:20,550
uh,
she's born with a gigantic cod.

502
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,190
Is Bruce breast or lightest or whatever 
it's called.

503
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:24,750
Where is your breast?
Just art.

504
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:26,670
Retardedly.
They're retarded bread.

505
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,270
Just a gift from God.
No,

506
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,940
no.
I mean these aren't even real breast.

507
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:34,200
These look like a fucking a category,
you know,

508
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,620
it looks like a worm or was it like the 
old lady breasts where it's like down at

509
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:40,590
their gut.
And if you look at this person,

510
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:41,160
you're like,
wow,

511
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:43,770
that person's fat.
But if you knew it was just like,

512
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,820
hey,
lift the blue up here.

513
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,080
No,
actually I'm fine.

514
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,390
Oh Wow.
They won't let her operate.

515
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:54,391
She's only like 18 and they won't let 
her operate because they'd say you have 

516
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:56,200
to lose 30 pounds because this is a 
really serious,

517
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,710
like a procedure,
procedures and the,

518
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,720
I guess you can't be overweight at all.
You have to be really healthy and she 

519
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:03,940
won't do it.
So now this poor girl is just,

520
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,990
wow,
she's so lazy.

521
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:07,510
She won't lose 30 pounds.
What a lazy bitch.

522
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,360
She know what someone needs to do 
something with your microphone.

523
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,660
You're plugging in like how heavy can 
you be back in tighter or something?

524
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,070
Everybody's in good shape.
I didn't do anything,

525
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,760
so.
No,

526
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:26,670
no.

527
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,130
Well Gentlemen,
we got kinks to it wouldn't turn me way 

528
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,130
down.
Well,

529
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,120
I'm trying to get rid of that.
That like there's like a buzz in it.

530
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,670
So Rogan,
what the fuck?

531
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,090
Tripling.

532
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,410
I'll tell the story of a you and me and 
a heckler.

533
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,290
I don't remember that one.
That was a funny one.

534
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,420
A whenever you want.
I don't know.

535
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,750
It's the greatest heckle kill of all 
time.

536
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,040
I was doing a Gig in Phoenix,
Arizona.

537
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:58,050
Friend of mine at a bar and eat.
Whenever I came in town he'd throw a 

538
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,320
standup show.
So I went down to stand up,

539
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:01,090
uh,
my aunt who's no longer with us,

540
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:04,330
but she finally got to come see me and 
she was like 80 at the time.

541
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,240
So she came down.
My whole family's there.

542
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:12,241
I'm onstage and I'm doing a joke about 
how I got my ass kicked by my 

543
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:17,251
girlfriend.
I got a scar right here from when she 

544
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:17,251
put me in the hospital,
you know,

545
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:21,110
I got stitches and all that stuff and I 
was talking about that and I dropped my 

546
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,110
punch and all of a sudden I hear jokes.

547
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,590
I'm like,
what?

548
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,310
She's like,
yeah.

549
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,760
I'm like,
oh,

550
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:27,510
what do you.
Oh,

551
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,520
who?
And I look and there's this really hot 

552
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,450
chick with this huge goon.
She was sitting on his lap and I'm like,

553
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:35,380
what are you talking about,
lady?

554
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,030
She goes,
that's not your joke.

555
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:42,031
That's Joe Rogan's joke.
You didn't write that you fucking stole 

556
00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:42,031
it from.
I go,

557
00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:43,240
no,
Joe Rogan's my friend.

558
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,710
He doesn't have that joke.
No,

559
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,720
it's his fucking joke.
I just heard him do it.

560
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,730
You're a fucking joke thief.
I go,

561
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:49,930
well,
how about this?

562
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:53,410
How about I called Joe and he'll tell 
you it's not his job.

563
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,760
She goes,
good,

564
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:59,761
do it,
but you won't because you're a fucking 

565
00:22:59,761 --> 00:22:59,761
joke thief.
I'm like,

566
00:22:59,761 --> 00:22:59,761
I'm on stage,
man.

567
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,380
Please let this have a good ending.
So,

568
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,170
uh,
so I'm like,

569
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:06,280
okay,
I'm going to call them,

570
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,360
but we got to make a deal.

571
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:12,190
If he says it's his joke,
I'll quit comedy now if he says it's not

572
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:17,191
his joke,
you have to come up here and let this 

573
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:18,520
guy in the front row lick your tits.
And she's like,

574
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:23,521
okay,
but you're not going to make call your 

575
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:23,950
fucking joke thief.
So I called Joe and uh,

576
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,980
usually Joe,
we'll get back to me the next day or 

577
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:28,980
something like that that I'm like,
Oh man,

578
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,100
he's not going to answer the phone.
So I call him.

579
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:31,540
I leave a message and I'm like,
Joe,

580
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,830
this triply,
dude,

581
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,200
I need you to call me right now.
I'm onstage,

582
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,630
call me and I hang up.
I'm like,

583
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:38,700
ah,
you didn't answer.

584
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,830
And she's like,
of course he didn't answer because 

585
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:43,830
you're a fucking joke thief.
I go,

586
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,011
it's like Friday night ladies probably 
doing sub that all of a sudden my phone 

587
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:48,270
rings act of God.
I don't know what it is.

588
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,600
Awesome.
It's fucking Rogan.

589
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,060
And I'm like,
but then you have a tea and tea and it 

590
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,060
drops in the union.

591
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,360
I'm like,
Rogan,

592
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:56,900
what's up?
He said,

593
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,810
what's up?
Tripling?

594
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,570
What the fuck are you doing?
I go,

595
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,160
I'm doing stand up.
He goes,

596
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,260
you're on stage right now.
I'm like,

597
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:04,130
yeah,
I go,

598
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:06,880
do you do joke about getting your ass 
kicked by your girlfriend?

599
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:07,520
And well,
you know,

600
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:12,521
Joe,
he doesn't get his ass kicked by 

601
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:12,521
anybody,
so it's not happening.

602
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:12,521
He's like,
no,

603
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:12,521
I don't.
I'm like,

604
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,180
okay,
you need to tell this guy this story.

605
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,580
So,
um,

606
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,610
and I tell them that,
you know,

607
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:18,950
this girl accused me of stealing his 
joke,

608
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:22,940
so I bring this guy on stage.
It's like I might confirm it's Rogan and

609
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,160
then repeat what he says.
Oh,

610
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:26,840
it's Rogan Joe Rogan.
Joe Rogan.

611
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,140
No,
he doesn't do a joke like that.

612
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:32,060
He's never done a joke like that.
And uh,

613
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:35,390
Sam Tripoli doesn't have to steal joke 
because he's a funny motherfucker.

614
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,530
Fuck you bitch.

615
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,310
And the whole place just goes,
man.

616
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,690
Did you record this?
Do you have a red band?

617
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,980
No,
I think one guy record,

618
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:47,360
I've always asked them,
it was lost in the ecosphere.

619
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,360
So the whole place goes nuts.
I can't follow that.

620
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:52,250
So I just am like,
Hey rogen,

621
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:54,230
thank you so much.
I got to take care of some business.

622
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,030
I hang up,
I go,

623
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:58,220
okay,
it's time to pay the toll to the troll.

624
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:02,330
Come up with this guy on your tits.
And she's like,

625
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:03,830
no,
I ain't going to fucking do it.

626
00:25:03,831 --> 00:25:06,950
And the whole place booze her right now.
So I'm like,

627
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:07,400
oh,
I can't.

628
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:09,140
I tried one joke.
I can't follow that.

629
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,690
It's the greatest heck kill of all time.
So I'm like,

630
00:25:11,691 --> 00:25:12,320
okay,
that's great.

631
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:13,480
Thank you guys so much.
Standing.

632
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:14,720
Oh,
I'm not lying to you.

633
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,930
Every chick in the place runs up to this
chick and starts fucking laying into 

634
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:21,500
her.

635
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,080
You're a fucking bitch.
You shouldn't have fucking done that.

636
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:25,580
You made a deal.
You should gun up there.

637
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,790
Let him lick your tits.
Fucking all of a sudden I see this chick

638
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:34,791
and her goon boyfriend running out of 
the bar because they're getting chased 

639
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:35,250
out by checks.
That is awesome.

640
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,470
And I wish you had the club was this.
It was a bark a called.

641
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,980
Oh,
what was the name of the bar?

642
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:43,220
I can't even remember.
Los Angeles knows in Phoenix.

643
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,620
He was in Hollywood.
I was in Phoenix.

644
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,380
This chick got bitch slapped in the six.
Oh,

645
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,610
two,
three,

646
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:50,210
two,
three.

647
00:25:50,211 --> 00:25:52,130
That is beautiful.
Isn't it crazy?

648
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:54,290
You can do that today,
dude.

649
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:55,210
That's a.
that's one.

650
00:25:55,211 --> 00:26:00,211
A big one.
That would have been such a great 

651
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:00,211
youtube video.
These clubs,

652
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:01,220
or if they were smart,
they'd be like,

653
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:02,540
look,
we're always going to record you.

654
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,850
If something fucking crazy happens,
uh,

655
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:09,851
you know,
we're going to put it on our youtube 

656
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:09,851
page.

657
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:09,851
We don't,
I don't like hecklers.

658
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:11,730
I really wish.
Every show is just fun.

659
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:16,731
Nobody had a good time,
but God damn interacting with those 

660
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:16,970
fucking retards sometimes makes for some
fun shit.

661
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,980
Fuck,
you know.

662
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,840
Have you ever thought about why they 
heckle?

663
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:20,660
Yeah,
I mean,

664
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:22,520
there's a whole bunch of reasons for 
sure.

665
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:24,230
They're all fucked up in the head.
No one,

666
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:25,850
no one heckles.
It's a cool person.

667
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:30,890
It's not what you would do.
I think girls heckled because they're 

668
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,570
either attracted to you or they.
They're mad at someone else's.

669
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:37,571
The center of attention.
There could be that or you could be 

670
00:26:37,571 --> 00:26:40,901
offensive to them and they feel like 
they have the need to shut you up or 

671
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:41,600
they,
they can stop you.

672
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:46,601
I've had that.
I've experienced that before where I 

673
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:46,601
felt

674
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:46,601
like,
uh,

675
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:47,400
like what I was saying,
like a girl didn't agree with what I was

676
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:49,020
saying and she just was not going to 
hear it.

677
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,730
She couldn't hear it and she had a yell 
shit out.

678
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:52,980
I've had that happen before where they 
just,

679
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:57,981
you could tell they just can't take it.
It's just like they're just too much a 

680
00:26:57,981 --> 00:26:57,981
control freak or something.
But you know,

681
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,480
the bottom line is I've seen a lot of 
things that I didn't enjoy,

682
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,370
you know,
but I just left,

683
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,900
you know,
that's the whole thing.

684
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:08,250
It's like I hate comment cards.
Nothing wrong with that man.

685
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,450
You know,
you want to know a bunch of people 

686
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:13,450
thought that guy socked,
you know,

687
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:13,990
if people pay them in cards or just like
mailing lists there.

688
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:19,030
That's pretty much the club.
Trying to get your information to 

689
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,650
advertise for it is boats also to get 
feedback.

690
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,480
They read,
they read the feedback.

691
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:26,481
Then I think there's some good things to
it because of a bunch of people got 

692
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:26,970
turned off to a show,
you know,

693
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,940
they should know.
I mean,

694
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:33,050
look,
you've got to find your own fucking 

695
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,050
audience,
man.

696
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,750
And until people knew what I did,
there was a lot of shows that I did were

697
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:35,250
a lot of people get offended,
you know,

698
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:40,251
people that came to see like the fear 
factor guy or some guy from television 

699
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:44,301
that they thought was cute and I'm 
talking about all kinds of crazy shit 

700
00:27:44,301 --> 00:27:48,650
that they don't.
They don't necessarily want to hear 

701
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:48,650
about it,
you know?

702
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,740
So I,
I totally understand the whole feedback 

703
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:51,740
system,
man.

704
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:56,950
I'm a yelp elite.
I get into the best thing about the 

705
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:56,950
internet is all the criticism that you 
get.

706
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,790
It seems to.
It seems like it's not,

707
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,720
but it is because some of it is good.
Some of it is very constructive.

708
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:05,410
Even if they're douchey about it.
It's like,

709
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,580
think about how you would criticize 
something anonymously if you were to 

710
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:10,580
totally anonymous and you weren't a 
performer.

711
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,620
You know,
when you saw something like it fucking 

712
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:15,620
sucked donkey text.
This guy blows,

713
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,560
he's got this ridiculous outlook on 
life.

714
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:20,190
It's not well thought out at all.
I don't want to hear him making his dumb

715
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:20,820
point,
you know,

716
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:25,821
that's what you'd say if you were 
totally anonymous and that's what 

717
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:25,821
they're going to say two,
but guess what,

718
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:29,031
man,
that's the real reaction to you and it 

719
00:28:29,031 --> 00:28:31,341
may be valid and it may not be.
They might be just fucking idiots who 

720
00:28:31,341 --> 00:28:34,791
look for negative shit and everything 
and they can't look at anything in a 

721
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:38,271
positive way and they could be jealous 
and they could have all sorts of other 

722
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:39,960
issues where they don't like other men 
having success or anybody having success

723
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,670
because they're unhappy if that's 
possible too.

724
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,040
But it's also possible they got some 
good points,

725
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:44,880
man.
You know,

726
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:49,881
I think it's real hard for us as,
as comedians performance to totally 

727
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:50,310
objective.
Look at your shit.

728
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,680
You know,
sometimes you don't want to.

729
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:56,690
Sometimes you don't want to edit your 
material or edit your writing or you 

730
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,021
don't want to like go back on it and 
improve it again and improve it again 

731
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:00,021
and try to figure out like,
what's wrong with it?

732
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:01,020
You know,
sometimes you get lazy,

733
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:05,250
but people all that shit on Youtube 
comments and message boards,

734
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:06,570
comments,
that's all good for you,

735
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:11,571
man.
I really believe that that's the best 

736
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:11,571
thing for your psyche to be able to,
to,

737
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:13,050
to really see things objective.
Lee.

738
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,390
Yeah.

739
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,850
The biggest thing I get on youtube is 
that drives me crazy is when people call

740
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:20,370
me racist,
I just can't stand it because I'm really

741
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:21,600
not.
I just can't,

742
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,230
can't even read that shit.
Like you can't read anybody on the,

743
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,260
on,
on the Internet because 90 percent of 

744
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,301
them are people that.
It might be just somebody you know 

745
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:33,950
fucking with you.
It might just be an interesting.

746
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,270
We've got a friend.
Let me tell this before you go.

747
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,750
We had a friend who broke up with a girl
and she got on every one of his youtube 

748
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,100
videos

749
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,930
and would write nasty fucking comments 
about them.

750
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:47,940
She created like a whole profile just to
fuck with them and that's what it is and

751
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,950
it easily or it's just one obsessed 
person that's making multiple accounts 

752
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,970
to make it seem like there's all these 
people flocking to you.

753
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,830
That happens.
A lot of people that think you suck.

754
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,680
I'm saying we know somebody that does 
that.

755
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,100
It does happen occasionally,
but I think that's not really worth 

756
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,530
looking at.
I think you know,

757
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:06,910
you look at like,
what's the tone?

758
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:08,440
What are they saying?
Are they just being retarded?

759
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,980
But is it valid?
There's something to it.

760
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,870
Yeah.
I like it because it doesn't leave it.

761
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,900
I'll leave like he has a valid point.
Made the comment if it's just some 

762
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,870
stupid ass,
makes no sense.

763
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:22,450
Some of you just want attention to.
They just want attention.

764
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:24,940
They just want to react to that 15 year 
olds on the computer.

765
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,070
Then you watch the documentary with 
Carlos Mencia.

766
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,920
Dude,
I showed it to you son.

767
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,930
No,
I was saying I haven't seen it yet.

768
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,360
Got to see the uh,
no,

769
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:39,390
actually I don't care.
I'll tell you exactly what it is on 

770
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,590
youtube we heard about this.
They did a documentary called I am comic

771
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:46,591
and in the comic documentary they talk 
to them and see where he just youtube 

772
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,740
look for Youtube.
Carlos Mendez he admits to stealing.

773
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,780
He's just so he doesn't admit it,
but he explains what everyone's always 

774
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,330
accused him of.
I mean,

775
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,500
he actually,
like,

776
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,980
he actually like Jay tries to justify it
by saying that it's like sampling.

777
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,080
I actually wouldn't care about this at 
all.

778
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,460
So after you showed it to me,
it really was amazing.

779
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,150
It was way more than I could ever 
imagine he would ever do.

780
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:15,180
Yeah.
I would have thought that it would have 

781
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,180
been some sort of thinly veiled joke or 
that,

782
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,180
you know,
he would,

783
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,560
you know,
sort of like come up with some sort of a

784
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,270
justification,
you know,

785
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:21,760
people are jealous or something and,
or just half asset,

786
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:23,260
but this is like,
you just flat out and that's it,

787
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:23,530
man.

788
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,430
You just listened to it.
Check,

789
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,320
check this.
Hold on.

790
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:31,321
Let me turn down all these volume.
You're going to freak out because it's 

791
00:31:31,321 --> 00:31:34,111
just so weird.
I was kind of actually starting to feel 

792
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:36,571
really bad for him lately because this 
is his twitter has been really 

793
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:36,571
depressing and stuff,
but this,

794
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:41,520
this is scary.
I felt bad for him after the Marin 

795
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:41,520
podcasts.
Yeah,

796
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,050
well that was hard for him.
I'm sure when Steve Trevino and 

797
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,480
Barcelona and all those guys got up,
I start,

798
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:48,770
I actually sit on my twitter,
you know,

799
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:53,080
if you ever want to get ice cream,
I'm here for you and I told you,

800
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:58,081
dude,
he's got a fucking poison your ice 

801
00:31:58,081 --> 00:31:58,081
cream.
Like the one guy ruined his life.

802
00:31:58,081 --> 00:31:58,310
Here's the clip.

803
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,050
A lot of people out there.
Why did the interview Carlos,

804
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,400
Carlos,
Carlos,

805
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,760
you can.
We know that listened to me and look at 

806
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,140
me when I tell you this with all 
honesty,

807
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,980
if you think that I still joke like,
yeah,

808
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:22,990
you're right.
We're trying to fucking steal jewelry 

809
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,000
out of your fucking mind.
When I come to a comedy club,

810
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:28,190
you better one bitch.
You better get the forecast stage 

811
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,030
because if anything even remotely funny,
I'm going to make it mine and Oh,

812
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:33,240
I'm going to do it.
Shouldn't Mexican in the front.

813
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,630
I'm like a rapper.
Sampled and make it my own.

814
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,950
What does it really my friend,
what it sounds like,

815
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,080
my kind of like somebody else's.

816
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,730
That's almost like watching a man 
implode.

817
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,910
There's something about seeing that 
because what he's trying to do and make 

818
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:56,910
it look like,
you know,

819
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,160
like he's a bad ass and he doesn't give 
a fuck sort of like,

820
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,610
you know,
like I rob people,

821
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,790
like a rapper would say it was the only 
thing he could do.

822
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:07,791
I think he needs to do this.
I think he needs to finally come clean 

823
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:10,731
with it because that's the only way,
unless you want us to live the next 30 

824
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:10,731
years being the joke like,
oh,

825
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:11,010
watch out for that guy.
You know?

826
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,880
I think he just had to do this.
Trying to justify it.

827
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,920
He's trying to justify it.
I mean he's trying to actually figure 

828
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:19,920
out a way where it could be.
Okay.

829
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,780
Did you notice how he kept saying,
y'all had this amazing memory?

830
00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:23,640
I have this amazing memory,
and then they're like,

831
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:26,000
well,
when you did this is one time to kind of

832
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:28,190
go up A.
I can't remember that.

833
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:28,250
Okay.

834
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,510
Remember that.
You know,

835
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,870
how about the dude doesn't have anything
written down.

836
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,780
How crazy is that as a comic?
Let me tell you something,

837
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:35,240
man.
There's,

838
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,640
there's a bunch of parts to being a 
comic like you,

839
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,510
you know,
this can't stand up.

840
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:45,511
Comedy is not just your ideas.
It's how you get those ideas out and 

841
00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:47,500
that needs honing and you'll take these 
ideas.

842
00:33:47,501 --> 00:33:49,810
You'll have an idea for a bit or an idea
for something.

843
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:55,410
I write everything out.
I write out what I think about 

844
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:55,410
something.
I write out what I think about a subject

845
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:00,121
just so I know like what my real 
thoughts and points are and then once I 

846
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:00,400
do that,
then I start dissecting it.

847
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:01,750
Okay.
What's funny about this,

848
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:04,150
when we get to the meat of this,
I know what I feel about this.

849
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,320
No,
let me get to the meat of this.

850
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,440
Now let me get on stage and let me 
figure out what's the best way to do 

851
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:10,440
this.
Am I going to introduce this part of the

852
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,061
idea first?
Am I going to go right into the 

853
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:15,061
punchline right away so it's totally 
unexpected,

854
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:19,760
but right to the meat of the,
the joke and then like build onto the 

855
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:19,760
thing once I've already told them what's
happening,

856
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,400
build onto it afterwards and make it 
just more ridiculous.

857
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,320
Like how am I gonna approach this?
Like there's a,

858
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:25,120
there's a lot of craft to it,
man.

859
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,150
You know,
Alibaba,

860
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:30,280
that invites involves writing shit.
I mean you can sort of remember it,

861
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,440
you know,
I've gone through periods of time where 

862
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,160
I had a bunch of bits that they just 
sort of came up on stage,

863
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:41,161
you know,
like they were attached to other bits 

864
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:41,161
and then they branched out,
became bits of their own.

865
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:45,480
But I never actually wrote them down.
I just knew how to do them from doing a 

866
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:45,480
monster.
And,

867
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,900
but for the most part man,
to create,

868
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:49,480
to really give something,
some time and some consideration,

869
00:34:49,481 --> 00:34:52,810
you've got to sit in front of a fucking 
piece of paper and think you know,

870
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:57,811
you kinda right.
And if you're doing standup and you're 

871
00:34:57,811 --> 00:34:57,811
not writing,
man,

872
00:34:57,811 --> 00:34:59,140
I kinda know.
I kinda think that you're just,

873
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,320
how is it,
how are those even really truly your 

874
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,301
opinions?
I mean your opinions are like all 

875
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:06,301
conglomerated with all the people around
you,

876
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:09,010
but you don't know what the opinion is 
until it's you by yourself.

877
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,500
Your act is alive until it's.
Yes.

878
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,270
It's constantly evolving.
Dude.

879
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:15,130
I always say that.
I always say that it's almost like A.

880
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,040
I mean it's very pretentious sounding,
but I say it's almost like a living,

881
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:23,041
breathing philosophy,
but I don't want to say philosophy 

882
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,280
because that sounds really fucking yoga.
He and pull yourself,

883
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,590
you know,
it's not that it's a philosophy,

884
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:31,591
but it's the way of looking at life.
It's like this is my way of looking at 

885
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:35,371
this particular situation that's going 
on and this particular time and then 

886
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:39,001
once it's recorded it's like frozen and 
then it becomes like know part of you 

887
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:39,001
know

888
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:39,480
who,
who your life was.

889
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,140
You know,
I mean that's.

890
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:41,200
But that's really what it is.
Right?

891
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,260
So everything I do,
I tried to turn into a joke at some 

892
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:46,260
point.
Do you,

893
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,610
how much time do you spend actually 
sitting in front of pieces of paper or 

894
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,730
computer writing here?
I do a little different man.

895
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,410
I mean I'll,
I'll sit down and write,

896
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:56,220
but I feel like I have to flow on stage,
get going.

897
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,410
I'll write it down.
But literally man,

898
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,440
I talked to myself all day.
I just worked a bit worse a bit and like

899
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:05,310
I'm driving.
I'll be okay here.

900
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,180
This is it.
Okay.

901
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:08,250
Tag Tag,
tag cut down.

902
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:13,430
And I don't want to work at too much.
I just want to get on stage one time 

903
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,150
getting the natural part,
right?

904
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:15,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

905
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,330
And then just flow and see where it goes
and just try to talk through it.

906
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:24,330
And isn't it funny how you got an idea 
and you write it out and you think that 

907
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,550
you're gonna say it one way,
but then when you're on stage at the 

908
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:27,660
moment just tells you to say it a little
different.

909
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,840
And now little difference.
Pam could make this fucking huge 

910
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,811
reaction to just a word.
You can tweak a bit man or a pause or 

911
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:37,380
just to setting it up correctly.
You know,

912
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:39,060
there's such a craft to it,
man.

913
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:41,730
It's just something that you're always 
fucking with you.

914
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:43,140
No,
it's so satisfying.

915
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,060
But for a lot of people it's so 
stressful.

916
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:50,450
You know,
I know a lot of dudes that eventually 

917
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:50,450
they want to get out and they want to do
tv shows and shit like that because just

918
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,580
doing the standup all the time,
just relying only on the standup.

919
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:55,200
It's just such a fucking wild ride,
you know?

920
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,380
Yeah.
They need like Louis C,

921
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,200
k does it,
man.

922
00:36:58,201 --> 00:36:59,640
He does it crazy,
bro.

923
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,820
He does a new special every year and 
then throws out all his material and 

924
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,960
starts fresh.
That's strong.

925
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,930
That's strong.
It has a strong work ethic right there,

926
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:11,700
man.
You got to put in some serious work,

927
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,930
you know?
That's uh,

928
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,640
that's,
that's pretty impressive,

929
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,570
man.
That's a dude who's dedicated to comedy.

930
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,290
Do you find yourself always been able to
come up with some mat?

931
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,700
Sometimes I go like a month without 
writing anything I like and I'm like,

932
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,040
oh yeah,
so go nuts.

933
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:26,760
I'm like,
dude,

934
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,560
you know,
what fixes that we'd,

935
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,880
we'd fixes the shit out of that.
You don't smoke weed though?

936
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,080
I'm not.
I quit pretty much drink too.

937
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,860
You should.
If you look at w,

938
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,040
when did you stop drinking again about,
uh,

939
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,680
like two months ago after Canada attempt
to believe through an them towels.

940
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:50,830
Then what's your addiction right now?
What division do you got going on right 

941
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:50,830
now?
Any.

942
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,430
Well,
I mean like a finger in,

943
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,440
and this is,
this is the way I think you should look 

944
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,321
at pot when it comes to comedy.
Po is like a turbo charger for your 

945
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,470
imagination.
Ideas that you have normally,

946
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:04,080
they'll become much more expressive to 
go down different alleys.

947
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,410
It's an enhancer for your mind.
People don't appreciate how much of an 

948
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,590
enhancer it is because it's associated 
with silliness.

949
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:15,591
It's associated with losers and just 
want to sit on the couch and eat 

950
00:38:15,591 --> 00:38:16,830
munchies and it's associated with a 
bunch of dumb,

951
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:21,831
Lazy Shit.
But the reality is that the effect of 

952
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:23,280
marijuana is fucking magical.
There's so much to it.

953
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:28,281
There's so much creatively that happens 
to you when you're writing and you get 

954
00:38:28,281 --> 00:38:30,600
high.
These ideas just come flowing 300,

955
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:35,601
400 percent better than when you're 
sober and don't recognize can you kind 

956
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:40,120
of treated as an end theologian treated 
as something that's helping to enlighten

957
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:45,121
you,
treat it as something that you're gonna 

958
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:45,121
use as a tool as you just want to get 
fucked up and party.

959
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:46,630
Yeah,
that's the fine line because if you're a

960
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:49,660
guy who doesn't have the best self 
control and that's what most comics are,

961
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,750
most of us are fucking crazy.
The reason why we do comedy in the first

962
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:54,430
place because we really couldn't do 
anything else.

963
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,590
Otherwise we would've done something 
else because it beginning.

964
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:58,810
It's so fucking hard and no one thinks 
they're going to make it.

965
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,860
You literally have to have almost no 
options and the guys who do have options

966
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:04,360
tend to go to those options.
Yes,

967
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:09,450
exactly.
And even if even if you do have those 

968
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,210
options span and it's like you,
a comic is going to blow shit off,

969
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,560
there's just no way around that.
Right?

970
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,940
I mean,
just the only way we got to be where 

971
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:17,940
we're at.
You have to be fucking above rapper.

972
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah.
You gotta be at least fucked up.

973
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,310
One starts at like rappers.

974
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,560
I mean those.
They're so hard to wrangle,

975
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:28,561
bro.
You got to just fuck was my original 

976
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:30,841
thought.
You thought I was smoking weed enhances 

977
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:30,841
everything.
Especially music.

978
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:32,620
Exactly.
What I think you should do is just,

979
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,600
if you want to try it at all,
if you want to do it at all,

980
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,180
treated as if you're going to go through
and experience.

981
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,220
Don't treat it as if you're going to get
fucked up and party.

982
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,900
That's how I do it.
When I write,

983
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:44,230
I treated it as if I'm ready to,
I'm going to experience something.

984
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:46,200
I'm going to go deeper into my mind and 
I'll say,

985
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,580
oh,
just get fucked up.

986
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,580
Put them on.
Do some writing,

987
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:49,930
man.
Now I say,

988
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:51,310
all right,
I'm getting ready to right here.

989
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:53,020
I got these ideas.
Now I'm going to,

990
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,120
you know,
get in touch with the spirit world.

991
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:00,540
Man.
Just thinks of it as a fucking tool to 

992
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:00,540
it.

993
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:00,540
If it didn't exist,
okay,

994
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,930
and if it wasn't illegal,
it didn't have all these things attached

995
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:05,110
to it,
you would think that shit is magic.

996
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:08,620
It makes fucking way better.
It makes food taste better,

997
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:11,520
it makes you nicer and it makes you way 
funnier.

998
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,450
Way more creative.
Way more honest.

999
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,650
Like your shit resonates more when 
you're high.

1000
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,500
I don't think I can perform high dude.
My head just try.

1001
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,680
I think some people are just,
they're wired different because I 

1002
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,660
understand being to stumbling on stage 
because I don't think when I'm.

1003
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:32,730
When I'm stoned I think about something 
and I obsess about something and like 

1004
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,400
ideas and stuff,
but I can't actually like my,

1005
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,920
like my okay,
I know what you're saying,

1006
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:39,700
but the reason why you don't think that 
going on stage stone would be fun.

1007
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:44,701
It's because going on stage,
it's not a comfortable part of your 

1008
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:44,701
everyday life.

1009
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:45,730
It's like you know how you can sit and 
edit stoned,

1010
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,900
you know,
and you get high and then it makes you 

1011
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:50,900
more creative and it's more fun.
Well I don't like talking to people.

1012
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,700
Usually when I'm still in.
Like if I,

1013
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:56,701
if I get stoned and talked to my mom,
it's going to be worse than if I was 

1014
00:40:56,701 --> 00:40:56,701
now.
You know what you mean?

1015
00:40:56,701 --> 00:40:56,950
Totally.
But for me,

1016
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:58,660
what it is,
is just an experience thing.

1017
00:40:58,661 --> 00:41:01,480
It's just like you got to get 
comfortable with the experience and when

1018
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:04,570
you've been doing comedy for like,
I've been doing it 22 years almost.

1019
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,700
Yeah,
that'd be 22 years in August.

1020
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:08,440
That's a long ass time,
man.

1021
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:13,590
When you're doing it for that long,
it really does become just like another 

1022
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:13,590
thing you do in life.
It doesn't,

1023
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:18,340
doesn't freak out.
So when you get high it's like you just 

1024
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,590
tune into that thing better.
So I can just fucking connect to it 

1025
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:22,590
better.
No.

1026
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:26,410
When did you start smoking weed?
Because I think when I first met you,

1027
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:28,150
you weren't a weed smoker?
No,

1028
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:29,470
not at all.
As a matter of fact,

1029
00:41:29,471 --> 00:41:31,160
I thought it was for losers.
And what,

1030
00:41:31,161 --> 00:41:32,590
what,
what made that change?

1031
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:33,590
I saw,
I tried it.

1032
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,880
Um,
you know,

1033
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:37,790
Eddie Bravo is the dude who turned me 
onto it because Eddie and I were,

1034
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,690
we met at Jujitsu and we were going out 
to lunch or talking about some shit.

1035
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:43,000
And he's a smart dude.
I was like,

1036
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,460
we had really similar philosophies on a 
lot of different things on,

1037
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,140
on politics and on the way the world 
works and like how strange everything 

1038
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:52,140
is.
Like a very curious,

1039
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:56,330
very similar point of view to mine,
but he would talk about getting high all

1040
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:58,910
the time and doing,
making this music and shit.

1041
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:01,010
And I was like,
how the fuck is that good for you man?

1042
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,120
I was like,
Pontus makes you fucking lazy.

1043
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,790
Like that's what I thought.
And he's like,

1044
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:05,050
no,
no,

1045
00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:06,530
no.
That's all propaganda.

1046
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:08,060
It's all,
if you don't know what you're doing,

1047
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:10,310
if you smoke the wrong kind of weed,
if you smoke too much,

1048
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:11,450
if you do it when you're drunk,
you know,

1049
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:12,770
you associate all these negative things 
with it,

1050
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:13,490
just try it.

1051
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,430
So I said,
all right,

1052
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:14,930
fuck it.
Come on,

1053
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:17,210
let's try it.
And from that day,

1054
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,820
from that day getting high,
I realized I'm like,

1055
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:21,140
Whoa,
this is crazy.

1056
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:26,141
Here's this.
There's a plant that gives you an 

1057
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:28,160
altered state of consciousness that 
actually makes things seem more.

1058
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,310
You're more sensitive to things and it 
makes you more aware of.

1059
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:35,540
It feels like some weird like 
intelligence enhancer,

1060
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,050
it feels like it makes you.
It makes you dopey,

1061
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,340
and the fact that sometimes you get so 
obsessed with one idea,

1062
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:44,290
you can't multitask at the same time.
So if you get how to fucking,

1063
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,100
you know,
how do you spell someone's name and your

1064
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:51,101
phone or if you can get some weird shit,
you forget what you were talking about 

1065
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,660
because there's just so much going on.
It's such a flood and it's just the.

1066
00:42:53,661 --> 00:42:55,610
The,
the key to the experience to using it as

1067
00:42:55,611 --> 00:43:00,611
to learning how to relax and learning 
how to get rid of all the shit that 

1068
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:00,611
makes you paranoid.

1069
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,230
Because when dudes get paranoid,
when you freak out about shit,

1070
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,200
you should be freaking out about that.
Whatever the fuck it is,

1071
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:07,460
you're freaking out about.
When you.

1072
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:09,620
When you get high,
that is something that you've put in the

1073
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:14,621
back of your head and you're avoiding 
and it's an issue that you need to 

1074
00:43:14,621 --> 00:43:15,380
resolve and once you do resolve those 
issues,

1075
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:17,300
once you don't have anything fucking 
with your head.

1076
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,480
Once you let come to terms with who you 
are in this life and and try to put it,

1077
00:43:21,481 --> 00:43:23,630
put out good energy and you feel 
comfortable with it,

1078
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,990
then you can ride that bitch.
Then when you get high you can fucking 

1079
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:32,350
tune into it all so you can get really 
high and not be paranoid and instead of 

1080
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,710
being paranoid,
you learn how to like,

1081
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:38,711
let go and tune into some sort of a 
higher state of truth than what you're 

1082
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:40,850
normally able to experience.

1083
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:45,970
You can see things in a perspective that
doesn't seem to be available to you in a

1084
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:49,520
sober state as much as you meditate,
as much as you try to release.

1085
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:54,700
Even if I'm in an isolation tank,
there's something about there's a 

1086
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,610
connection that plant gives you to 
something else,

1087
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,230
you know,
and I think we just,

1088
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,440
we have it categorized as something 
that's like silly and we have it 

1089
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:02,480
categorized as something,
you know,

1090
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,670
a man,
we watched this movie,

1091
00:44:04,671 --> 00:44:09,671
it was awesome.
Which is totally true to you can do 

1092
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:09,671
that,
especially if you smoke like couch weed,

1093
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:12,620
but you can also smoke weed and and 
figure out the universe.

1094
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,270
I mean Carl Sagan used to smoke weed 
every day.

1095
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:21,090
Why it is I think the propaganda that 
went along with the people who didn't 

1096
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:21,100
want you thinking like that,
you know,

1097
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:24,280
to a point with reefer madness and all 
that stuff.

1098
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:27,790
It's like when you get high or you do 
shrooms and all that stuff,

1099
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,620
you start seeing things differently.

1100
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,650
Yeah.
And you know,

1101
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,020
people will go Fulcan rogen and his 
bullshit part propaganda.

1102
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:37,590
Like what are you talking about bro?
You're getting brand damage,

1103
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,050
you're focusing,
you're losing your mind.

1104
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,470
You know the people who say that all of 
them don't smoke weed.

1105
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,430
It is just smoking weed.
They don't give a fuck.

1106
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,280
People that bash iphones because they 
have iphones,

1107
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:54,470
apple,
somebody put a thread up on the 

1108
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,421
underground the other day,
Tom lawler filthy tom law or though the 

1109
00:44:56,421 --> 00:44:56,421
fighter.
I said,

1110
00:44:56,421 --> 00:44:57,150
why should I tell me why I should buy a 
Mac?

1111
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,110
And you know,
people like you,

1112
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:04,630
if you're gay,
sell these dudes like get fucking upset 

1113
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:05,690
at Max,
you know,

1114
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,630
weird.
There's so many retards out there.

1115
00:45:07,631 --> 00:45:12,631
It Bro,
there's so many retards and all of them 

1116
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:12,631
just need.
They needed to be raised better.

1117
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:17,570
All of them,
all of them were raised by other 

1118
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:17,570
retards.

1119
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:18,240
And it's just a cycle to thin the herd.
Don't want,

1120
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,020
you know,
what we gotta do,

1121
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:24,021
we gotta figure out a way to fucking 
make people like develop and grow and 

1122
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,770
evolve and catch the fuck up because 
these dumb asses,

1123
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,310
having kids,
these people that are just their life is

1124
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:34,311
a fucking holy rack.
The relationships are filled with 

1125
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:37,250
fucking yelling and screaming and chaos 
and all sorts of dysfunctional bullshit 

1126
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,810
and drugs and alcoholism and in hate and
anger.

1127
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:42,360
And these kids grow up in that and then 
they're fucked.

1128
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,620
You know,
they grew up in that.

1129
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:48,621
They get,
they get poor programming when they're 

1130
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,271
young.
So they never figured out how to really 

1131
00:45:50,271 --> 00:45:50,271
see the world and healthy and loving 
way,

1132
00:45:50,271 --> 00:45:51,870
you know,
they're always need either always angry.

1133
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:56,871
There was always negative.
Like that's how they're fucking 

1134
00:45:56,871 --> 00:45:59,090
programmed.
And they're going to program kids just 

1135
00:45:59,090 --> 00:45:59,090
like them,
unless something snaps them out of it,

1136
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,620
whether they get addicted to meditation 
and become a monk or getting into 

1137
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,670
martial arts or you know,
learn,

1138
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,920
learn how to do a fucking sport where 
you can get out of here wherever the 

1139
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:09,920
fuck you are you're at and you know,
and,

1140
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,040
and,
and figure things out for yourself.

1141
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:16,250
But you need to like really fucking 
rethink your whole world when you're 

1142
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,280
raised like that for most people.
That's so fucking hard.

1143
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,860
Yeah,
the middle of nowhere.

1144
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,810
I think people are just like,
they're just slowly dying.

1145
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:26,811
It's just like to go out there and learn
about all this stuff takes effort and I 

1146
00:46:26,811 --> 00:46:27,870
just saw my chapter.
People don't want to do that.

1147
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:32,871
They don't,
they're too lazy and they want you to 

1148
00:46:32,871 --> 00:46:32,871
think the way they're thinking.
Well,

1149
00:46:32,871 --> 00:46:34,740
you couldn't do want you to think the 
way they're thinking.

1150
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:37,500
That's what they want.
That's what being a right wing person is

1151
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:42,501
all about.
That's what people who are nationalism 

1152
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:42,501
internationalism,
that's what it's all about.

1153
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:45,210
It's all about you thinking like we're 
all part of this one thing.

1154
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,840
Drink blue moon to fuck.
Just still put your quick.

1155
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,860
There's the Christian diction who's 
booked on crystal ball juice.

1156
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,520
Yeah.
It's so low.

1157
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,220
Their idols crashes and Burns instead of
being like,

1158
00:46:56,221 --> 00:46:58,560
well,
maybe we don't have.

1159
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,240
We don't see it right there.
Like,

1160
00:47:00,241 --> 00:47:04,860
I'll fucking get rid of him.
And you guys pops up saying they see it.

1161
00:47:04,861 --> 00:47:05,910
Right.
It's crazy.

1162
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:10,080
Anybody you can't.
We have to talk this fucking thing out.

1163
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,410
You can't say you have the answers.
There's too many questions.

1164
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,390
It's impossible.
It's too tricky.

1165
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,460
You never have crossed over and come 
back.

1166
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:22,461
You know.
Most of them have never even had 

1167
00:47:22,461 --> 00:47:24,111
alternate experiences like psychedelic 
experiences that they can add to their 

1168
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:24,150
model of the world.
You know,

1169
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:29,151
there's altered states.
It can be achieved by fucking plants on 

1170
00:47:29,151 --> 00:47:29,151
this that are growing here on this 
planet.

1171
00:47:29,151 --> 00:47:33,401
Know if there really was God,
do you think it would just leave things 

1172
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:33,401
like that there.
I mean if God,

1173
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:35,020
if there was a really,
it was a god and he had a plan.

1174
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:40,170
If you think that,
then you really should believe in 

1175
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:40,330
psychedelics because they're there for a
fucking reason.

1176
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:43,360
God's not just going to put some shit 
that makes you have these beautiful,

1177
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,440
loving,
positive,

1178
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,160
incredibly mind expanding experience.
That's just a dumb coincidence.

1179
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,320
You know,
that's just a dumb coincidence that that

1180
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:52,780
grows on cow shit.
Like if you're religious,

1181
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,900
you should be into psychedelic 
experiences and if you into psychedelic 

1182
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,591
experiences,
the first thing you're going to say is 

1183
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:01,591
no one knows.
You can't know.

1184
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:02,620
There's no fucking way.
There's no answers.

1185
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:08,010
We all have to try to figure out what's 
the best model of behavior for this 

1186
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:12,421
life.
What's the best way we can get by with 

1187
00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:13,030
the most positive energy?
Because we don't know what the fuck am I

1188
00:48:13,031 --> 00:48:14,680
believe in Karma.
Yes.

1189
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:15,550
It's real.
Fuck.

1190
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:16,660
Yeah.
Fuck did I do.

1191
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:20,710
I totally believe in.
It could be like,

1192
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,800
it might not happen today,
tomorrow,

1193
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,090
a year from now,
but it will come back.

1194
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,160
Yes.
Here's my take on Karma.

1195
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,620
I don't even think.
I think even the way we think of Karma,

1196
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:31,780
we think of it selfishly,
that we think,

1197
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:36,810
you know,
I don't want to do bad things because I 

1198
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:36,810
want,
you know,

1199
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:36,810
good things come back to me.
So I'm going to do good things.

1200
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,500
So the good thing come back to me.
You know,

1201
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:40,420
we,
I mean even the term Karma,

1202
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:42,340
like the way people use it up,
that's Karma.

1203
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,810
See what happened to him.
Karma.

1204
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,150
It's almost like self justifying,
you know,

1205
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,210
I think the way to look at it is that 
you,

1206
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:54,270
and this is all shit that I like decided
on after I had dmt trips,

1207
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:59,510
is that I think all the energy that you 
put out,

1208
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:04,670
so it's sort of your choice.
It's sort of your choice to be positive 

1209
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:07,360
and when you're positive,
positive will resonate more positive.

1210
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:08,920
It's,
you put yourself in a,

1211
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:11,050
in a group of people,
you put yourself in a,

1212
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:11,940
you know,
a,

1213
00:49:11,941 --> 00:49:15,490
a,
a think group that are all like that.

1214
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,530
When you're positive and you're like a 
friendly,

1215
00:49:17,531 --> 00:49:20,020
loving person,
you're going to naturally have that kind

1216
00:49:20,021 --> 00:49:21,790
of behavior from your friends.
You're going to,

1217
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:26,820
they're going to feel like they can be 
that way with you and that's going to 

1218
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,011
ripple out.
And so all the people that are gonna be 

1219
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:31,321
in your circle after awhile,
we're all going to be like loving 

1220
00:49:31,321 --> 00:49:31,570
positive.
Cool people and that's possible,

1221
00:49:31,571 --> 00:49:32,830
man,
we can all do that.

1222
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,160
We literally can all do that.
It's just hard to do.

1223
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,210
You know,
it's hard.

1224
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,660
It's hard to find cool people.
It's hard to find people that you can,

1225
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,040
you can open up with and you'd be cool 
with it and you get to a point in your 

1226
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,440
life where you can,
can,

1227
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:49,570
you want them to be successful.

1228
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:53,050
You want them to be happy,
want great things for them,

1229
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:55,810
like literally want that for them as 
much as you would want it for you.

1230
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,210
You know,
instead of thinking of Karma as like,

1231
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,390
you know,
you do good thing.

1232
00:49:59,391 --> 00:50:01,120
So do good things.
Come back to you.

1233
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:05,920
It's more to me like your energy.
We're all energy and when you,

1234
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:10,950
you resonate positive energy and when 
you push forth positive energy is 

1235
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:14,470
fucking hippie and crystals and yoga 
beads as that sounds.

1236
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:17,350
I really think that shit is,
is how the universe works.

1237
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,930
I think if you're a negative negative 
fucked up,

1238
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:22,120
Shit's going to happen.
It's supposed to,

1239
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:27,390
you know,
and I think a lot of the times when we 

1240
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:27,390
have negative content,
our life,

1241
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:27,390
you know,
it's like,

1242
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:31,620
it's almost like we are.
Life is a mathematical problem and some 

1243
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:31,620
things will come up in your life.

1244
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:31,620
Male,
female,

1245
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,170
whatever.
Job Boss,

1246
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:35,180
whatever the fuck it is.
There's things that come up in your life

1247
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:40,181
that are absolutely negative and it's 
your job to figure out how the fuck to 

1248
00:50:40,181 --> 00:50:40,580
get past this part of the game.
It's that simple.

1249
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:44,120
You don't just say,
oh my fucking job sucks.

1250
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:45,560
There's not.
My boss was a Douche,

1251
00:50:45,561 --> 00:50:49,450
so I'm getting fucking ulcers because my
boss is fucking always on my ass.

1252
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:50,750
I'm always nervous.
No,

1253
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,490
that's.
This is an intelligence test.

1254
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:53,020
Okay.
You've,

1255
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,350
you've reached a problem.
Yeah.

1256
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,030
It might be very difficult to solve this
problem.

1257
00:50:56,031 --> 00:50:58,670
You might have children.
You might have obligations that you have

1258
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:03,671
to think,
so this problem might take you a couple 

1259
00:51:03,671 --> 00:51:05,741
of years to solve,
but it's your fucking job to solve this 

1260
00:51:05,741 --> 00:51:05,741
problem.
Douche bag.

1261
00:51:05,741 --> 00:51:06,770
It's not your job to go to the doctor 
and take a fucking pill,

1262
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,920
makes you loopy,
and then you do go cocaine one night and

1263
00:51:09,921 --> 00:51:12,170
shoot up a fucking movie theater.
You know what I'm saying?

1264
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,970
I mean,
you get your shit together,

1265
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:17,000
son.
Get get your fucking shit together.

1266
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:22,001
This life is a test.
It's all like little things that you 

1267
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:22,340
come across in your life.
You're going to fail,

1268
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:24,410
you're going to have mistakes,
but that's all good.

1269
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,090
That's what they're supposed to be there
for.

1270
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,470
Everything's energy,
man.

1271
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,780
Yeah.
I mean it sounds totally ridiculous.

1272
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,100
Tubes and tunnels as I believe and I 
believe it was tubes and tunnels.

1273
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,680
Tron.
Yeah.

1274
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,830
Tron,
you see toy story three d,

1275
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,890
it was a dope.
I love it.

1276
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,900
I hear it's awesome.
That is probably the best movie ever to 

1277
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,320
get as stoned as closest to.
I'm having a heart attack.

1278
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,690
Get that stone.
Go see toy story three.

1279
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,850
It's fucking crazy.
I just.

1280
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:55,580
I know you might not.
I love animated movies really well.

1281
00:51:55,581 --> 00:52:00,581
Like did you like up dude?
It was better than up and that's saying 

1282
00:52:00,581 --> 00:52:00,590
a lot because I love.
Fuck.

1283
00:52:00,591 --> 00:52:04,280
How great was up when your baked goods.
You're going to love this.

1284
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,750
I saw the incredibles.
Hi.

1285
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:08,840
It was so good.
It was magical.

1286
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,300
Avatar high is the best movie in the 
world.

1287
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:15,130
You know what I.
I'm waiting for it to come out blue,

1288
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:20,131
right?
Like a better ray versions I haven't 

1289
00:52:20,131 --> 00:52:20,640
seen yet because they haven't seen it.
I've seen it.

1290
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:21,440
I've seen it,
but no,

1291
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:26,441
they released a stripped down blue ray 
and then they're going to release like 

1292
00:52:26,441 --> 00:52:26,441
an extended version blue.
Right?

1293
00:52:26,441 --> 00:52:28,430
Like in a couple months.
And so I'm waiting.

1294
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:31,340
I'm not going to just go buy this frugal
shopper.

1295
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:36,580
Well,
I don't want to buy three versions of 

1296
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:36,580
Avatar about him not winning the Oscar

1297
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,220
gives a fuck man.
Really?

1298
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:40,050
These are goofy jokes.
The,

1299
00:52:40,051 --> 00:52:40,880
the,
the idea that you're,

1300
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:44,450
you're fucking,
you have awards that you'd give to art.

1301
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,420
Who can,
who the fuck is he to say what is good?

1302
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,400
There's shit that people like that I 
hate.

1303
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,290
You know,
there's women that thought sex necessity

1304
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:53,000
to is the greatest movie in the history 
of the world.

1305
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,590
Would I have liked to?
Probably not.

1306
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,500
Did you watch Kimmel last night?
No,

1307
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,650
dude.
They ran out of power and they,

1308
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:01,210
that's what was going on.
They all right.

1309
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,370
So anyways,
I think I looked at it and I'm like,

1310
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,440
that's completely the marketing,
you know,

1311
00:53:05,441 --> 00:53:10,441
that's completely like a good idea to 
advertise the green Hornet trailer that 

1312
00:53:10,441 --> 00:53:10,720
they premiered and stuff like that 
because they,

1313
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:13,420
it was weird because they were like,
we don't have power for the cameras,

1314
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,230
but yet then they're in a room where the
tvs are on and the lights are on.

1315
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:17,950
I'm like,
well,

1316
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,490
I mean,
what's the,

1317
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,980
what kind of cameras do not just 
plugging a lot I guess.

1318
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,710
And we can find out.
We can find out what it was.

1319
00:53:23,711 --> 00:53:25,980
Genius.
It was John Barris will tell us.

1320
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,250
Yeah,
Don was on it last night.

1321
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:28,680
He was taking the laptop and show him 
like,

1322
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,630
Hey,
Don calling don bears right now.

1323
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:34,710
Do not release this information.
But what's weird is that that uh,

1324
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:39,711
I bet that got so much ratings because 
of that you don't have that little 

1325
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,740
gimmick and stuff like that.
The whole show was watching this use 

1326
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,760
stream on tv and it's brilliant because 
what if,

1327
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,460
what was he was doing it in photo booth 
or whatever.

1328
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,640
That Mac.
A Basic Mac program that comes with it.

1329
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:52,410
Photo.
It's totally scam.

1330
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:58,130
Scam.
I don't know because half of you wants 

1331
00:53:58,130 --> 00:53:58,130
to go.
No,

1332
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,730
this.
I could see this accident on television 

1333
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:02,950
and so the whole episode was filmed with
a Shitty Webcam,

1334
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,000
you know,
on his Mac book and I'm like,

1335
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:07,770
wait,
what if that becomes popular?

1336
00:54:07,771 --> 00:54:12,771
We start going backwards with our hdtvs.
We're now watching ustream shitty 

1337
00:54:12,771 --> 00:54:12,820
videos.
No one.

1338
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,330
I didn't mind it.
I mean I only watch a couple of minutes.

1339
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:17,330
The sound is what got me.
It was awesome.

1340
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:19,930
When I was A.
I was watching a fight and I shut it off

1341
00:54:19,931 --> 00:54:21,940
and I was getting ready to go to bed and
when I shut the light off,

1342
00:54:21,941 --> 00:54:24,640
the regular tv came on,
the fight was on the dvr and then it was

1343
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:26,410
on and I was like,
what the fuck is going on here?

1344
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:27,430
But it made me tune in

1345
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,920
because I was like,
yeah,

1346
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:30,830
it worked.
It worked.

1347
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:35,860
Come off.
Watch how often do you actually watch 

1348
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,681
talk shows?
Do you want to talk to you about that 

1349
00:54:38,681 --> 00:54:38,681
much?
I tivo.

1350
00:54:38,681 --> 00:54:40,430
I like wait for the youtube clips 
because if like letterman said something

1351
00:54:40,431 --> 00:54:42,650
really hilarious,
it's going to be in a youtube clip.

1352
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:46,550
I mean I don't have an hour and I tivo 
them all and then if somebody says,

1353
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:48,000
hey,
did you watch the Lenovo or whatever,

1354
00:54:48,001 --> 00:54:48,500
and I'm like,
oh,

1355
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:53,501
watch that.
Then I gave you a lot at that time too 

1356
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:56,320
because I go up late.
We're isn't being friends with all you 

1357
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,431
comics because all of you like it can't 
do anything except go to comedy clubs 

1358
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:05,051
every night.
Like he pretty much right off your life 

1359
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:07,510
at a comedy club every single night 
because like I was going through some 

1360
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:07,510
tough times recently.
I'm like,

1361
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:07,510
Hey,
who can I call?

1362
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,720
No,
I don't want to see your show.

1363
00:55:08,721 --> 00:55:09,620
I've already seen it.
Hey,

1364
00:55:09,621 --> 00:55:10,610
how you doing?
Oh No,

1365
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:14,150
I don't want to go see your show.
Like you guys never stopped.

1366
00:55:14,151 --> 00:55:14,540
Like,
Hey,

1367
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:15,770
come to my show.
Come to my show.

1368
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:19,940
It never stops.
Maybe you're just an awesome audience.

1369
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,590
Members bring your camera,
Brian,

1370
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:24,620
what the real problem is,
Brian,

1371
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:29,621
is that they have to go up.
I know that's the only way you can hang 

1372
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:29,621
out.
How do you,

1373
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:31,460
how do you guys devote so much of your 
life though too?

1374
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,410
Because I'm not talking about like every
night,

1375
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,510
especially weekends.
You have to work man.

1376
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,190
I mean if you want to be a comic,
you got to work.

1377
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,980
You,
you're a writer yourself,

1378
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,720
producer,
you're the director,

1379
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:47,721
you know,
if you putting out a shit product 

1380
00:55:47,721 --> 00:55:47,721
directly affect,
you know,

1381
00:55:47,721 --> 00:55:47,910
reflects on you,
you gotta be careful.

1382
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,260
You gotta work at it,
you know,

1383
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,600
and stand up comedy man.
If I take a couple of weeks off,

1384
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:56,601
I feel rusty doing it 22 fucking years 
and I'd take a couple of weeks off and 

1385
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:56,601
I'm like,
Ooh,

1386
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:58,790
I'm a little rusty here.
I'm not feeling this right though.

1387
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:04,820
I was uh,
I was in Australia even though I was 

1388
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,891
gigging out there and I came back and I 
did a store set and I got heckled right 

1389
00:56:06,891 --> 00:56:09,270
out the gate and it went bad fast too.
It was like

1390
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,270
goals or dark,
Bro.

1391
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:16,420
There's something about heckling in the 
store that leads much quicker to 

1392
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,000
violence and anger and like real 
tension.

1393
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:22,150
I've never had people throw shit at me,
but I've had two people throw things at 

1394
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,150
me at the store.
It's

1395
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,320
so weird,
man.

1396
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:24,100
And the,
the bouncers are all

1397
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:29,130
emo fucks borders and fucking death cab 
for cutie or something like that.

1398
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:32,700
There's some big fuck in the,
in the,

1399
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:37,730
the uh,
original room and he's yelling at 

1400
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:39,721
somebody like,
remember when he ultimately got knocked 

1401
00:56:39,721 --> 00:56:41,620
out?
Knocked out holtzman.

1402
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,160
Yeah.
Martin Lawrence was fucked up in the 

1403
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:47,160
audience,
but I don't know if he was fucked up.

1404
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,510
I might've been added that part to it.
But in a big night for him though,

1405
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:52,240
like ICM was down.
All the people from ICM,

1406
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:55,540
it come down to see holtzman.
So they saw him get knocked out.

1407
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:00,400
They saw the crazy.
Lawrence might've just changed his whole

1408
00:57:00,401 --> 00:57:01,450
career path.
Like,

1409
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:06,451
no,
you're not going to become a movie star 

1410
00:57:06,451 --> 00:57:06,451
band without change.
Holtmann's career path.

1411
00:57:06,451 --> 00:57:06,790
Well,
I mean,

1412
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:07,960
what if those guys were like,
dude,

1413
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:09,560
we love this comic.
They said they were like,

1414
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:11,550
did he just got knocked out?
Yeah,

1415
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,730
maybe,
I dunno,

1416
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:17,790
you know,
Holtzman was the type of guy that would 

1417
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:17,790
kill kill comedians.

1418
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:22,740
He would kill us,
but it was a lot of people that didn't 

1419
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:22,840
see it as a goof and they thought it was
just,

1420
00:57:22,841 --> 00:57:25,330
he was just this really Douchey,
angry man.

1421
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,600
He didn't see how funny it was.
The main fucked up shit that he was 

1422
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:30,600
saying with that,
that character.

1423
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,650
Now the comedy store doesn't work.
It doesn't,

1424
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,920
it.
The comedy store is such a dark evil 

1425
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:38,260
fucking place for people that don't 
know.

1426
00:57:38,261 --> 00:57:43,261
The comedy store used to be Ciro's 
nightclub and Bugsy Siegel ran that 

1427
00:57:43,261 --> 00:57:44,980
place in the fifties and the forties,
wherever the fuck it was.

1428
00:57:44,981 --> 00:57:46,210
What was that?
I think the forties,

1429
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:51,211
forties.
Bugsy Siegel apparently had a bunch of 

1430
00:57:51,211 --> 00:57:52,510
people murdered.
Yeah.

1431
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,550
Shane.
And apparently,

1432
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:59,551
you know,
everybody that works there has these 

1433
00:57:59,551 --> 00:57:59,551
creepy fucking horror stores,
you know,

1434
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,840
they all talk about ghosts and shit.
But that said,

1435
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:06,000
almost everybody that works there is 
crazy and does drugs with a,

1436
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:06,610
the grants salt.

1437
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:09,180
My friends always found funny about 
ghost man is like,

1438
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,530
I don't know if you ever watch,
um,

1439
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:13,850
paranormal shows,
you know,

1440
00:58:13,851 --> 00:58:16,510
and those show up and they'll interview 
the person and there'll be like,

1441
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,660
you know,
and then fire came out of the walls and 

1442
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,760
the blood was everywhere and then 
they'll do like dead time thing when see

1443
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:25,000
that curtain move.
Yeah,

1444
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,910
that's bullshit.
It's all night vision and a basement.

1445
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:32,440
What's that noise?
Every show nobody ever goes on video you

1446
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:37,441
have to do is fucking go to a cemetery 
like midnight on Halloween and just go 

1447
00:58:37,441 --> 00:58:39,670
find somebody that murdered wife or 
something like that and start making fun

1448
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:40,390
of her,
you know?

1449
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,380
And like nothing will happen.
They'll go,

1450
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,610
has ever killed anybody,
man,

1451
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,040
you know,
do you like,

1452
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:50,260
I've,
I was always taught that like ghosts.

1453
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,480
Maybe we're like,
it's all energy man.

1454
00:58:52,481 --> 00:58:56,440
And maybe energy gets lost in some kind 
of wealth transfer.

1455
00:58:56,470 --> 00:59:01,470
If you look at our existence on this 
planet as it were in a frequency.

1456
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,830
You know,
and this is,

1457
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,590
I mean if you don't understand how this 
works,

1458
00:59:05,591 --> 00:59:10,591
but quantum physicists believe that 
there are 11 dimensions as the current 

1459
00:59:10,591 --> 00:59:11,950
model of reality.
11 different dimensions.

1460
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:16,150
Obviously we can't to intercede those 11
different dimensions and if we,

1461
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:18,250
from what we know about like radio 
waves,

1462
00:59:18,251 --> 00:59:19,780
think about like radio waves,
thinking about how,

1463
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:22,220
you know,
97 point one is loud and clear

1464
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,110
and I have to do is turn that dial and 
you're on one.

1465
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:24,850
Oh,
seven point nine.

1466
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,630
Totally different music,
loud and clear.

1467
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,960
It's like there are frequencies,
very specific frequencies.

1468
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:33,080
If that exists with something as 
intangible as radio waves,

1469
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,380
how do we not assume that that doesn't 
work with reality as well?

1470
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:37,620
Maybe.
Maybe you know,

1471
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:43,090
maybe there's so many different things 
that are tuned in around us all the 

1472
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:45,701
time.
They're just on a frequency that we 

1473
00:59:45,701 --> 00:59:45,701
can't detect and it doesn't interact 
with this frequency,

1474
00:59:45,701 --> 00:59:50,530
but all this shit is going on together 
in one big just fucking crazy cosmic 

1475
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:51,340
soup.
You know,

1476
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:53,360
if that's the case,
shit,

1477
00:59:53,361 --> 00:59:55,100
anything's possible.
Ghosts,

1478
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:55,970
there could be.
I mean,

1479
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,530
what a ghost could be somehow or 
another.

1480
00:59:57,531 --> 01:00:02,531
The energy of the experience of what 
happened to them when they got murdered 

1481
01:00:02,531 --> 01:00:02,531
or something like that,
you know,

1482
01:00:02,531 --> 01:00:04,450
because it's always like horror stories 
always.

1483
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,650
The guy had an awesome life and now he's
a ghost.

1484
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:10,440
It's fucking brutally raped and murdered
and then they,

1485
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:15,441
they roamed that house.
Maybe that experience maybe the 

1486
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:17,860
spiritual horror and shock and 
terrorists so powerful that it actually 

1487
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,040
leaves like a,
like a,

1488
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:24,070
you know when your monitor gets frozen 
on a screen and then it like stays on 

1489
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:28,391
that image.
There's like the ghost of that image in 

1490
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:28,391
the background.
You know what I mean?

1491
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,180
Because it got too much energy from that
one position.

1492
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:32,080
It got locked into that one pattern and 
so the old,

1493
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:35,150
especially those old shitty screens 
aren't turned in you.

1494
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:40,170
You would burn in an image.
It's very possible that an image of 

1495
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,660
someone dying and extremely horrible way
is actually burned into the world.

1496
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:47,800
But that said,
I think most people are completely 

1497
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:47,800
fucking full of shit and they're just 
dumb.

1498
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,910
They're just in basements.
Fucking goggles on.

1499
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,660
Why is it always gay guys and fat chicks
do that shit,

1500
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:56,530
but it's the same people that would be 
into like goth music and spring,

1501
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:59,030
the spring or breed.
It's the cheater breed.

1502
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:01,070
It's all those shows that the same 
breed,

1503
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:06,090
you know,
that's a Brita human as there's always 

1504
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:07,130
people that are looking for something 
mysterious,

1505
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:09,050
you know?
That's why I love monster quest.

1506
01:01:09,051 --> 01:01:14,051
I got a little bit of that in myself 
that like getting into like fucking 

1507
01:01:14,051 --> 01:01:16,220
secret shit to.
Do you think sasquatch is real?

1508
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:18,020
I mean,
I've gotten so far as like read.

1509
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:20,420
I've probably read a dozen books on 
sasquatch.

1510
01:01:20,421 --> 01:01:22,700
I tell there's no.
It's real might be,

1511
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:24,620
but this is why I might be.
There's a.

1512
01:01:24,621 --> 01:01:29,621
there's an animal called gigantic 
[inaudible] that lived in Asia and that 

1513
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:31,820
animal lived exactly where the same 
Asians who came across the bering strait

1514
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:36,821
and came to America and eventually 
became the native Americans that they 

1515
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:36,821
came from the same place.

1516
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:41,020
So if this animal,
this big gigantic eight foot tall 

1517
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:44,770
bipedal primate that actually lived.
If that was in North America,

1518
01:01:44,991 --> 01:01:47,450
if it came across the bering strait with
the people who's to say it didn't,

1519
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,650
that could live in the Pacific northwest
like,

1520
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,680
but actually seeing it by now,
we would've me,

1521
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:54,440
you know.
Let me tell you something.

1522
01:01:54,441 --> 01:01:59,441
From living in the mountains and from 
talking to people that live in the 

1523
01:01:59,441 --> 01:01:59,441
mountains,
it's,

1524
01:01:59,441 --> 01:02:02,380
there's so many,
there's so many mountain lions are so 

1525
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:02,390
many bear.
There's so many fucking animals up there

1526
01:02:02,391 --> 01:02:05,720
and you rarely see them.
And the thing is when you do see them,

1527
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:07,760
you see live ones,
you never find a dead one.

1528
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:13,060
It's very rare because the forest eats 
the fucking animals and if you're in a 

1529
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:15,020
place like the Pacific northwest,
have you fly over that area,

1530
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:20,080
it's so dense like you don't realize how
vast the forest until you fly over 

1531
01:02:20,521 --> 01:02:20,640
there.

1532
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,640
It's basically a rain forest.
The Pacific northwest is incredibly 

1533
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,970
dense woods where nobody goes.
How the Loch Ness.

1534
01:02:26,971 --> 01:02:28,500
I mean it's like,
it's stupid.

1535
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:33,501
Who Cares?
There's fucking killer whales in the 

1536
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:33,501
ocean.
They're real.

1537
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:34,470
They're super intelligent.
They speak in dialects,

1538
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:39,471
they save people.
The only time they murder peoples in 

1539
01:02:39,471 --> 01:02:41,931
captivity,
those are real things that are killer 

1540
01:02:41,931 --> 01:02:41,931
whales.
Save people,

1541
01:02:41,931 --> 01:02:41,931
save people.
Yeah.

1542
01:02:41,931 --> 01:02:46,131
No killer was ever killed anybody.
I don't care about the size or the loch 

1543
01:02:46,131 --> 01:02:47,570
ness monster.
He just wrote that off that quickly.

1544
01:02:47,571 --> 01:02:48,600
Fish.
It doesn't do shit.

1545
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:51,810
This guy might just be a person.
That tall guy that lives in.

1546
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,490
I'm not totally sold on bigfoot.
I'm not sold.

1547
01:02:56,491 --> 01:03:01,491
I'm not saying that it exists on the 
exact same level of bullshit,

1548
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,370
you know,
like we would have found them,

1549
01:03:05,371 --> 01:03:07,980
but it's possible that with the loch 
ness monsters,

1550
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:11,040
they think it's might be Aplysia sore 
that somehow or another got landlocked,

1551
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,770
but there's not enough evidence.
They've looked really hard.

1552
01:03:13,771 --> 01:03:18,771
They've done sonar searches of the 
entire ocean floor or the entire lock 

1553
01:03:18,771 --> 01:03:18,771
floor.
See,

1554
01:03:18,771 --> 01:03:20,690
it's not like the woods and in,
you know,

1555
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,460
in Oregon or something like that where 
you really can't get in there.

1556
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:28,520
It's not like that.
It's just one specific body of water so 

1557
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,821
they can do a pretty thorough job of 
looking inside for anything big that 

1558
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:34,470
swims and if there's a fucking thing 
that's been around for a long time,

1559
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:37,500
chances are there's a family of them.
He spot a few of them and then that spot

1560
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:42,501
and shit,
they don't find anything that if you 

1561
01:03:42,501 --> 01:03:44,610
only get a blip,
probably a fucking turtle farts or 

1562
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:44,610
something like that.

1563
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:50,450
It doesn't.
It doesn't interest me because it 

1564
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:50,660
doesn't do anything to the primate thing
interests me because of the.

1565
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:55,670
The idea that this thing could be 
superintelligence just like champs and 

1566
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:56,790
avoid people.
You know who the Congo.

1567
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:57,590
Okay.
There's,

1568
01:03:57,591 --> 01:04:02,591
there's an animal in the Congo that 
they've just recently discovered 

1569
01:04:02,591 --> 01:04:03,310
recently being they.
They confirmed it in the 1990.

1570
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:08,370
It's called the Bondo ape or the billy 
ape and what this is is a gigantic 

1571
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,860
chimpanzee.
They're much bigger than regular.

1572
01:04:10,861 --> 01:04:15,861
Chimpanzees is like six feet tall and 
they stand upright and they have gray 

1573
01:04:15,861 --> 01:04:19,761
hair.
A lot of them have gray hair and they 

1574
01:04:19,761 --> 01:04:19,761
fucking sleep on the ground like 
gorillas.

1575
01:04:19,761 --> 01:04:21,600
They don't give a fuck.
Nothing fucks with them.

1576
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:23,550
And there's two types of chimps that 
the,

1577
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,200
uh,
the people that live in that part of the

1578
01:04:25,201 --> 01:04:26,730
jungle,
they call them,

1579
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:29,430
the regular ones are tree beaters and 
lion killers.

1580
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,760
There's tree beaters in lion killers and
these guys were recently in the Congo 

1581
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,970
filming this fucking thing.
This is a bonafide,

1582
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,640
absolute real animal.
They have DNA,

1583
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,500
they have photographs,
they have video,

1584
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:43,440
they have bones,
they have a first samples,

1585
01:04:43,441 --> 01:04:45,390
they have all these different things 
that show that it's some sort of a,

1586
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:50,540
some sort of a new species of 
chimpanzees and it's fucking living in 

1587
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:51,660
the Congo.
They know where it is.

1588
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:56,690
They know where it is right now,
but they didn't fucking know about this 

1589
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:57,270
until this wasn't confirmed until like 
the nineties,

1590
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:02,300
like [inaudible] 94,
I think it was when they all came to a 

1591
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:02,300
consensus and said,
hey,

1592
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,661
this is a real animal,
will have a giant chimp that sleeps on 

1593
01:05:05,661 --> 01:05:06,780
the fucking ground.
They have video of one evening a Jaguar.

1594
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:12,140
Okay.
These fucking guys came upon it and it 

1595
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:12,140
was eating a Jaguar.

1596
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,160
They don't know if it killed the Jaguar,
not but the local say they do.

1597
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,170
But what the fuck,
man,

1598
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:19,180
what the fuck?
That's a real animal.

1599
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,920
That's a real animal that lives in the 
Congo.

1600
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:23,950
It's very possible that there could be 
some super high,

1601
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:29,190
high intelligence level primate that 
survive just with a couple hundred of 

1602
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:32,380
them in a very small part of the woods 
and they have amazing hearing,

1603
01:05:32,381 --> 01:05:37,381
an amazing sense of smell,
and they just avoid humans because it's 

1604
01:05:37,381 --> 01:05:37,960
too difficult to get to them.
So they stayed tightly packed in.

1605
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,520
There's plenty of fucking food.
If they're vegetarians there,

1606
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:45,580
which they probably are.
Otherwise they wouldn't be eating 

1607
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:45,580
people,
you know.

1608
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:45,580
Sure.
Right.

1609
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:49,981
If there were predators at all,
there had been people and then we would 

1610
01:05:49,981 --> 01:05:49,981
hear crazy stories about the meeting 
people,

1611
01:05:49,981 --> 01:05:54,090
but everybody that sees them,
nobody gets eaten in the middle of the 

1612
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:54,090
night.
Nobody gets their tent pulled apart.

1613
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,710
So most likely they're like gorillas.
Gorillas are vegetarians to.

1614
01:05:56,711 --> 01:06:01,711
So they're probably just a big fucking 
vegetarian animal that lives in the 

1615
01:06:01,711 --> 01:06:01,711
woods.
It doesn't mean that exists,

1616
01:06:01,711 --> 01:06:02,290
but it's fucking possible.

1617
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:05,880
What was the animal that they thought 
was the mermaid?

1618
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:11,540
And you're like,
how lonely were you when you thought 

1619
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:14,030
that this fucking beast was a woman?
I saw it in Australia.

1620
01:06:14,101 --> 01:06:15,930
I can't remember the name of it.
I don't even know.

1621
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:18,480
It's not a manatee county.
What is it?

1622
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:19,590
Got?
Damn it.

1623
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,460
I don't know.
Google.

1624
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,080
Google that shit,
son.

1625
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:23,600
I don't.
I've never even heard this.

1626
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:25,360
Yeah,
it's,

1627
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:30,590
it's a,
there's an actual animal that they 

1628
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:34,970
basically thought we were mermaids.
Like those guys are so desperate out 

1629
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:34,970
there.
They're looking for chicks wherever they

1630
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:35,480
can find it.

1631
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:36,950
Two,
could you imagine?

1632
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:37,730
I mean,
look,

1633
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,440
we live in Hollywood,
pneumonia fucker.

1634
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:44,470
Rubber Pussy Convention.
A horny those dudes be when the brown 

1635
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:44,510
boats for like six months.
Fuck the pussy.

1636
01:06:44,511 --> 01:06:46,630
Were you like,
I don't know about rubber one.

1637
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,710
You one.
You mean the flashlight?

1638
01:06:48,711 --> 01:06:49,370
No,
no,

1639
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:54,430
I have no shame.
Just stuck on my deck and squirt inside 

1640
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:54,430
it and that was it.
I was like,

1641
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:54,830
wow.
That's pretty good.

1642
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:57,290
Good Dude.
You bust a strong.

1643
01:06:57,291 --> 01:06:59,690
Not Strong.
Is that a man?

1644
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,650
I know it was a different name though.
I'll find it out.

1645
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,060
Yeah.
No,

1646
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,370
it's a different name.
I'll tell you.

1647
01:07:07,371 --> 01:07:08,060
Sure.
Yeah.

1648
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,140
It's not a manatee

1649
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:11,400
Sam triply making shit up.
Caught them,

1650
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:12,900
ladies and gentlemen.
No way man.

1651
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:19,540
That shit kind goes saying manatees.
What kind of balls those guys have to 

1652
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:23,661
have that lived in like fucking England 
when we get on boats and go across the 

1653
01:07:23,661 --> 01:07:24,310
ocean,
think about that shit on.

1654
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:27,300
Look at a map,
look at where the fucking continents are

1655
01:07:27,301 --> 01:07:30,540
and think about how fucking crazy you 
would have to be to take a boat,

1656
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:33,870
fill it up with enough food to hopefully
make it to the other side.

1657
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:36,750
Yesterday had a,
do you have a stuffed up pitch with food

1658
01:07:36,751 --> 01:07:39,620
and ration that shit off and people 
would die because they didn't get enough

1659
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:44,630
vitamin C,
they'd get fucking scurvy and it right 

1660
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:44,630
away.
It's crazy.

1661
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:44,630
And they just throw them in the water

1662
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:46,240
about the uh,
the uh,

1663
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,570
pirate cook.
Did you read that?

1664
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,520
No,
it was on Huffington Post.

1665
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:55,550
One of these smiling pirate cooks turned
on all of his crew and he gave all the 

1666
01:07:57,481 --> 01:08:01,290
hostages guns.
He's feeding them because you know,

1667
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:03,180
they were getting abused.
He was feeding them.

1668
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,050
They started hearing the pirates talk 
about harvesting their organs.

1669
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:11,880
So he got them all like guns and they,
they attacked the,

1670
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:15,980
killed all the pirates.
Now here's what's crazy is no country

1671
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,890
will accept this pirate.
They won't accept them.

1672
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:22,250
So this guy who ratted out his friends 
and gave them the guns,

1673
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:25,580
they won't accept him.
You say ratted or save some people.

1674
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:26,270
Either one.
Yeah.

1675
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,970
Well you just decided it was too much or
maybe he didn't like them.

1676
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,940
Maybe they were Douche bags.
Maybe he's a Douche bag to the brow,

1677
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:37,100
you know,
and that they were just douche bags as 

1678
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:37,100
well and they didn't get along.
You know,

1679
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:37,100
it might not be a good guy,
bad guy.

1680
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,620
Situation.
Like say some people who were hostages.

1681
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:44,650
Sure he did.
But maybe it's because he hated those 

1682
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:46,301
other dudes.
This motherfucker already keep enough 

1683
01:08:46,301 --> 01:08:46,301
money this month.
Uh,

1684
01:08:46,301 --> 01:08:50,290
fuck I showed them.
I flick when you come back for the food 

1685
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:50,600
I give you,
can I give you a gun?

1686
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:55,601
You highlight pirate living with me.
You don't need to play pool or alarm 

1687
01:08:55,601 --> 01:08:55,601
system.

1688
01:08:55,601 --> 01:08:56,660
Yeah.
But maybe he decides to kill you.

1689
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,960
Fuck your girlfriend.
Maybe duct tapes a pistol inside your 

1690
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:01,960
mouth.
Like fucks your woman.

1691
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,000
How about that crazy shit dude.
That guy's living wild.

1692
01:09:05,001 --> 01:09:08,060
Son has a fucking pirate and all over 
the seat.

1693
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,400
I bet you know.
Never give a fuck.

1694
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:12,920
You clean it out.
Clean.

1695
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:18,170
Cleaned my clock.
Cleaned my think I fuck with you now.

1696
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:20,390
Clean.
You have to clean his dick.

1697
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:25,990
He pisses and it makes it clean.
You'll be a have a Somali pilot in your 

1698
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:27,650
house.
That's like living with a wild man bro.

1699
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,990
They're wild bro.
They don't have any future this.

1700
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,530
When you living in Somalia like what's 
the,

1701
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,770
what's the future?
They don't give a fuck.

1702
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:37,010
They're ready to die.
You know they don't give a fuck dude.

1703
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,080
They're out.
Jack and ships.

1704
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:44,200
They're getting a little rowboats with 
machine guns and rocket launchers and 

1705
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:44,200
they're climbing on board.

1706
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:47,960
Big giant ships and Jack and everybody.
They are fucking locators,

1707
01:09:47,961 --> 01:09:52,961
man.
Well that's what they say about a 

1708
01:09:52,961 --> 01:09:53,180
terrorists who blow themselves up.
It's not really religion.

1709
01:09:53,181 --> 01:09:56,320
It's more about.
They just have nothing going on there.

1710
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:59,690
There's this book called a why two 
beautiful people have more daughters.

1711
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,040
It's about evolutionary psychology and 
they talk about that.

1712
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:06,680
It's not really religion,
it's more about that.

1713
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:08,100
These guys feel,
yeah,

1714
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:13,450
they have,
they have no chance to make money and 

1715
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:16,150
they have no chance of meeting a woman 
because they're so broke and like all 

1716
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:21,071
the rich guys get all the chicks,
so it's like that's why they get 

1717
01:10:21,071 --> 01:10:21,071
promised like,
hey,

1718
01:10:21,071 --> 01:10:22,820
you get all these virgins and you get 
all this stuff.

1719
01:10:22,821 --> 01:10:25,160
Those are also the people that you can 
get to doing something because they just

1720
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:26,960
want to belong.
They want to be special.

1721
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:31,961
They want to be treated like they're 
special and you know when they're 

1722
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:31,961
getting someone to become a suicide 
bomber.

1723
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,260
If you ever looked at like there was a 
special.

1724
01:10:33,261 --> 01:10:37,520
I don't remember what show was on,
but they were in somewhere in the Middle

1725
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,760
East and they have this school and on 
the school they had these photographs of

1726
01:10:40,761 --> 01:10:45,761
these people that have blown themselves 
up and we're all this religious writing 

1727
01:10:45,761 --> 01:10:48,731
on it and there was a big sign above the
school that says today's children are 

1728
01:10:48,731 --> 01:10:52,841
tomorrow's holy martyrs.
And like God damn like they're there.

1729
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,220
The attention that they give to those 
children,

1730
01:10:55,221 --> 01:10:58,010
they make them out to be heroes.
They make them out to be special that so

1731
01:10:58,011 --> 01:11:01,100
many people want people's love and 
affection and they want.

1732
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:04,580
They want to be special so badly that 
they're willing to do almost anything.

1733
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,990
Yeah,
it's crazy,

1734
01:11:05,991 --> 01:11:07,010
man.
It's like,

1735
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:12,011
don't you wish you go back in time and 
just rewrite some of the religious 

1736
01:11:12,011 --> 01:11:12,920
books?
Take out all the asshole stuff.

1737
01:11:12,921 --> 01:11:14,100
You know what I'm saying?
It's like throughout

1738
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,920
time people have always bullshitted 
other people to control them.

1739
01:11:16,921 --> 01:11:17,970
I mean,
it's so simple.

1740
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:19,980
It's so obvious.
It's existed forever.

1741
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,550
What's amazing though is that the 
bullshit that worked like 2000 years ago

1742
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,740
still works today just because it's 
written,

1743
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:26,580
you know,
it's just,

1744
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:27,870
this is what,
this is what it is.

1745
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:28,650
I mean,
it's like,

1746
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:29,630
you know,
when you,

1747
01:11:29,631 --> 01:11:34,631
when you really get into it and you 
start reading about women being treated 

1748
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:35,220
as second class citizens,
condoning slavery,

1749
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:40,250
condoning murder,
all the crazy shit that's in religious 

1750
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:44,361
texts,
all that nutty shit that people still 

1751
01:11:44,361 --> 01:11:44,370
suck on it.
Two thousand years later,

1752
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:49,920
years later,
I always thought that religion was more 

1753
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,550
like a,
just like early science,

1754
01:11:50,551 --> 01:11:53,430
like people trying to explain,
just laying down the law,

1755
01:11:53,431 --> 01:11:58,431
man,
it's laying down the law and laying it 

1756
01:11:58,431 --> 01:11:58,431
down.
It wants to stay.

1757
01:11:58,431 --> 01:12:00,360
I listen to you,
cause if you don't go down,

1758
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:01,350
that's what it is.

1759
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,800
It's like you've got to keep dummies in 
line with crazy talk and that crazy talk

1760
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:08,840
spread and it became a good way to keep 
social order intact.

1761
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:09,660
Key people,
you know,

1762
01:12:09,661 --> 01:12:10,910
in small towns,
man,

1763
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,920
go to the church,
everybody's all happy and friendly and 

1764
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:15,920
it makes everybody together,
you know.

1765
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,940
But if you look at like all these people
that are doing fucked up things in the 

1766
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:19,940
world,
you know,

1767
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:20,250
whether it's suicide bombers were Somali
pirates,

1768
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,860
they come from somewhere that fucking 
sucks.

1769
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,370
And that's what it all boils down to.
Their life fucking sucks though.

1770
01:12:26,371 --> 01:12:28,470
Somali pirates did you know the whole 
story behind that?

1771
01:12:28,471 --> 01:12:30,410
Why they became pirates?
Dude,

1772
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,630
they call themselves the people,
but if they call themselves the fucking,

1773
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:38,070
the volunteer coastguard of Somalia,
that's what they call themselves.

1774
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:43,490
And what happened was European ships and
companies and I believe some Americans 

1775
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:49,281
to we're dumping waste into their waters
and fucking up there fishing man.

1776
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:55,160
And they found out about this because 
there are fish were dying and what they 

1777
01:12:55,351 --> 01:13:00,351
did was kidnap a boat that was illegally
trespassing through their waters and 

1778
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:05,991
they demanded a ransom because this was 
one of the boats that was polluting the 

1779
01:13:05,991 --> 01:13:06,630
waters.
And these guys were fishermen,

1780
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:11,631
man.
There were fishermen that had their 

1781
01:13:11,631 --> 01:13:11,631
livelihoods fucked up and taken away 
from them.

1782
01:13:11,631 --> 01:13:14,810
So they turned to crime and they started
jacking people because they've got so 

1783
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:18,681
much from the first boat.
They just turned it into a business and 

1784
01:13:18,681 --> 01:13:19,540
now they just jack people constantly.
Dudes.

1785
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:21,150
You're getting jacked all the time,
man.

1786
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:26,330
If you.
There are hundreds of miles out to sea 

1787
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:26,330
just looking for people.
Man,

1788
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:27,940
what do you think about the 16 year old 
girl?

1789
01:13:27,941 --> 01:13:30,100
That's my whole point about saying her 
around the world.

1790
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:31,240
It's like,
man,

1791
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:34,850
when you leave America,
it's a whole different game to women's

1792
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:38,490
parents are so foolish.
That's so foolish.

1793
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:40,920
There's one thing to let some experience
someone something.

1794
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:44,490
There's another thing to put someone out
in the wild just to get it.

1795
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,220
What are you going to get a rush out of?
The fact that he made it across,

1796
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:52,400
you know,
you did something that could kill you 

1797
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,520
mean one of the benefits.
Is it so difficult and you did it.

1798
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,560
She's amazing.
She did something.

1799
01:13:55,740 --> 01:14:00,740
You did something that I can do in a 
plain stupid you can get in a plane and 

1800
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:00,750
that can be across that ocean and 10 
hours.

1801
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,950
Why the fuck would you spend five weeks 
in a sailboat that's retarded.

1802
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,080
That's not a smart way

1803
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,660
because that's a hell of a facebook 
status.

1804
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:13,661
That's why you know,
that's all she's thinking about it like 

1805
01:14:13,661 --> 01:14:13,661
I until

1806
01:14:13,661 --> 01:14:13,661
they going to do it,
it's gonna be so cool.

1807
01:14:13,661 --> 01:14:15,010
And where do you go from there?
I mean,

1808
01:14:15,011 --> 01:14:17,800
you're 16.
You keep going around the world.

1809
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:19,730
What do you do next?
These assholes are getting hot,

1810
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:23,290
hot air balloon guys over.
If I stay out around the road,

1811
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:28,320
whatever you want to get wet this with,
this wants you to treat her.

1812
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:33,530
She's special.
She's doing something special that 

1813
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:33,530
people are crazy.
They're nuts.

1814
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:35,560
It's a crazy fucking desire with chicken
San Diego over that.

1815
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:37,480
She's like,
would you send a 16 year old boy?

1816
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:39,460
I'm like,
before 16 year old girl.

1817
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,710
Yes.
I would send a 16 old boy before 16 year

1818
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:46,711
old girl,
but I wouldn't send a 16 year old 

1819
01:14:46,711 --> 01:14:48,400
either,
but I love my boy that I raised and I'm 

1820
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:48,460
going to put him in harm's way.
I would tell them,

1821
01:14:48,461 --> 01:14:48,910
listen,
man,

1822
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:50,380
I don't want to be alone in the woods.

1823
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:55,500
If you want to do something scary,
let's get you involved in some 

1824
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:55,500
competition.
Okay?

1825
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,560
You don't want to fucking wrestle in 
high school.

1826
01:14:56,650 --> 01:15:01,650
You want to.
You want to do some boxing and 

1827
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:01,650
kickboxing or something crazy.
Wanted to fight some MMA fights.

1828
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:05,660
You want to do something crazy?
Let's do something that we can control 

1829
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,310
you.
Not going to put you in the fucking 

1830
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:08,310
ocean.
That's nuts.

1831
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:08,310
All right.
I understand the,

1832
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:10,360
uh,
the rising above,

1833
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:15,420
like accomplishing crazy things,
doing things that appear to be 

1834
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:18,451
impossible.
They give you more of an understanding 

1835
01:15:18,451 --> 01:15:18,451
of yourself.
They don't just give you this rush.

1836
01:15:18,451 --> 01:15:19,360
They give you an understanding of what 
you're capable of.

1837
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:21,610
They give you more confidence,
it gives you more you,

1838
01:15:21,611 --> 01:15:26,611
you,
you get a sense of what you're capable 

1839
01:15:26,611 --> 01:15:28,951
of performing.
What you're capable of doing under 

1840
01:15:28,951 --> 01:15:28,951
pressure makes you more,
you know,

1841
01:15:28,951 --> 01:15:30,850
like there's a quote that I read once 
about taekwondo,

1842
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:33,640
that fighting and competing and in 
Taekwondo,

1843
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,920
it elevates your human potential.

1844
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,090
You know,
like it,

1845
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:42,150
it gives you,
you have more potential because you've 

1846
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:42,150
already experienced harder,
more difficult things.

1847
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:43,630
That's all well and good.
I understand that,

1848
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:49,110
but fucking putting yourself in the 
ocean and putting yourself in a position

1849
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:50,110
where,
look,

1850
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:53,170
there could be some shit happened to you
that you have no way of escaping.

1851
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:58,350
There's no way getting it out.
You're gonna get a nice thrill because 

1852
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,841
you're going to put your life in danger,
but the reality is you're just getting 

1853
01:16:00,841 --> 01:16:01,840
from one place to another.
That's all you're doing.

1854
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:07,140
You're doing it old school,
you're just getting from one place to 

1855
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:07,140
another old school.
That's all you're doing.

1856
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:08,560
You know,
it's so stupid.

1857
01:16:08,561 --> 01:16:09,180
It's like,
you know,

1858
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:13,300
if someone chose to walk across America 
and they starve to death along the way,

1859
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:14,710
we should.
We feel bad for them.

1860
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:16,150
What the fuck are you doing?

1861
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:18,040
What do you.
What is southwestern New York?

1862
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:19,870
It's like fucking 300 bucks.
I mean,

1863
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:20,470
come on,
man.

1864
01:16:20,471 --> 01:16:25,471
Really,
you're going to walk across the country 

1865
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:25,471
and clearly agree with you fucking 
asshole.

1866
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,730
This is crazy parents there.
I mean,

1867
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:30,670
you've got to push your kids to a point.
You have to push your kids.

1868
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:33,550
You know people don't push it out to 
push your kids.

1869
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:38,640
Well,
I mean you gotta think you'd give them 

1870
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:38,640
some discipline and you know,
but you,

1871
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,810
you teach them that with risk and with,
you know,

1872
01:16:40,811 --> 01:16:45,811
with work become come satisfaction.
You get to achieve something and that 

1873
01:16:45,811 --> 01:16:47,290
satisfying and it makes you understand 
and appreciate yourself better.

1874
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:50,320
It makes you understand people better.
It makes you function better.

1875
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,450
It's more like.
It's like lifting weights.

1876
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:54,250
You lift weights,
you get stronger,

1877
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:56,530
you get stronger.
You can pick things up easier.

1878
01:16:56,531 --> 01:17:01,531
It's that simple.
Wouldn't life you take on difficult 

1879
01:17:01,531 --> 01:17:01,531
tasks.
You take on difficult,

1880
01:17:01,531 --> 01:17:05,851
difficult things that caused you to 
think because your mind to spend caused 

1881
01:17:05,851 --> 01:17:09,181
you to react quickly caused you to make 
good choices that elevates your human 

1882
01:17:09,181 --> 01:17:09,181
potential.
It's really that simple.

1883
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:11,240
Nope,
I agree.

1884
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:12,530
People don't do shit,
man.

1885
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,720
Oh,
your phone motherfuckers that shit.

1886
01:17:14,721 --> 01:17:16,370
Of course it is.
You get it on your laptop.

1887
01:17:16,371 --> 01:17:17,720
I saw it,
but we all have mics.

1888
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:20,960
Yeah,
but you're on your computer.

1889
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:23,360
You don't still here.
That's a phantom sound son.

1890
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,940
Phantom.
Phantom.

1891
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:27,590
Speaking of phones tomorrow I found.
Have you guys been watching?

1892
01:17:27,591 --> 01:17:30,800
They're looking at the reviews.
The reviews are for G.

1893
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,080
I'm scared.
The reviews are fucking amazing,

1894
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:38,081
man.
I'm thinking att and t service is going 

1895
01:17:38,081 --> 01:17:38,930
to hit an all time shitty low and so 
that hopefully not.

1896
01:17:38,931 --> 01:17:43,931
But you know,
one of the cool things that all the 

1897
01:17:43,931 --> 01:17:44,300
reviews are saying is how great the 
video calling works in.

1898
01:17:44,301 --> 01:17:48,680
Like it's just perfect.
Like it works a video.

1899
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:50,480
You could switch from front to back 
camps.

1900
01:17:50,481 --> 01:17:52,010
So like if you're talking to me and you 
go,

1901
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:53,120
oh my God,
look at this guy,

1902
01:17:53,121 --> 01:17:54,440
he's doing this,
you know,

1903
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:56,240
and it'll switch to the front of the 
camera.

1904
01:17:56,241 --> 01:17:59,150
Apple is the future.
It is just crazy.

1905
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:04,690
They're masters at marketing their 
masters or getting people excited about 

1906
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:04,690
their products.
Yeah.

1907
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:06,080
Oh I am.
I mean the phones,

1908
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,370
what else do you use most everyday?
A phone.

1909
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:11,000
Oh,
you're going to buy the first one.

1910
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:12,620
You know,
not to buy the first one.

1911
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:20,040
I mean you're,
you're going to buy like right out the 

1912
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:20,450
gate and then two weeks later it's going
to be like half price,

1913
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:22,590
but not logic.
You should never buy anything.

1914
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:23,910
Just wait.
The iphone,

1915
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,690
stolen iphones don't change price at 
all.

1916
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:31,750
Like throughout the whole year.
It's usually almost exactly the same 

1917
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:32,630
thing that they weren't crazy about.
I think.

1918
01:18:32,631 --> 01:18:37,631
Yeah,
it was the iphone where like all these 

1919
01:18:37,631 --> 01:18:39,371
guys wait in line.
They bought it for like a gazillion 

1920
01:18:39,371 --> 01:18:39,371
dollars.
Oh,

1921
01:18:39,371 --> 01:18:39,700
the first iphone,
the first iphone,

1922
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:44,860
it was half price.
They flipped out when it first came out 

1923
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:45,230
with the price.
When the first iphone came out,

1924
01:18:45,231 --> 01:18:47,980
it was $100 more and then they dropped 
it $100.

1925
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:52,990
They gave everyone $100 back.
Didn't they recently lowered the price 

1926
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:53,640
of the three g or they're always doing 
that because they're still selling that,

1927
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:58,720
but they're still selling the second 
generation one for like 49 bucks or 

1928
01:18:58,720 --> 01:18:58,720
something like that.
And she says,

1929
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:01,170
I am son now,
but don't get the new shit.

1930
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:05,870
New Shit drops.
A little,

1931
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:09,650
little frugal shopper.
Pablo Escobar son,

1932
01:19:09,651 --> 01:19:13,760
I gotta I gotta sell you a super vhs 
real speaking of frugal shopper.

1933
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:18,960
Do you guys hear about that?
A fucking federal judge that blocked 

1934
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:18,960
the,
uh,

1935
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,220
the,
he obama to put a moratorium.

1936
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,800
It was trying to put a moratorium on 
offshore drilling.

1937
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:27,690
So this federal judge drops it,
you know,

1938
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:31,190
he won't.
He blocks the moratorium and everybody's

1939
01:19:31,191 --> 01:19:32,090
like,
what the fuck?

1940
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:33,650
Who is this guy?
This guy's crazy.

1941
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,710
The Obama says he wants to stop oil 
drilling.

1942
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:39,730
There's a giant fucking hole where oil 
is leaking out of the ocean.

1943
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:40,220
Were like,
hey,

1944
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:45,400
we might have a fucking problem here.
We gotta make sure this is ruining the 

1945
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,840
ocean for hundreds and hundreds and 
hundreds of miles.

1946
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:53,080
Anyway,
it turns out this federal judge has 

1947
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,151
stock in the company and in Trans Ocean 
they have stock his stock at five 

1948
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,610
different companies that are involved in
the selling business.

1949
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:03,630
Wow.
This motherfucker can literally profit 

1950
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:04,070
from his own decision.

1951
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,050
How crazy is they should not be allowed 
to do this.

1952
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,070
Should not be allowed

1953
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,530
to have money.
If that guy,

1954
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:12,210
if that guy was on the case,
they should have said,

1955
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,080
I,
you know,

1956
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:16,050
we see that you have stock in this,
in this company that could,

1957
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,870
you know,
in your decisions could adversely affect

1958
01:20:18,871 --> 01:20:23,871
you financially.
So we're going to remove you from this 

1959
01:20:23,871 --> 01:20:23,871
case.
I mean,

1960
01:20:23,871 --> 01:20:26,590
that's,
that's what rational person like with 

1961
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:26,590
everything though,
like if you win a prize at,

1962
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:27,000
wait,
are you,

1963
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:29,070
do you work for NBC or any of its 
affiliates?

1964
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:34,071
You know,
that's how like everything always is 

1965
01:20:34,071 --> 01:20:34,240
with everyone else except the president 
is not as voided from it.

1966
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:37,380
That's weird man.
How these guys have this detach,

1967
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:40,640
detach from just humanity.
You know what I'm saying?

1968
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:45,740
It's just straight evil.
Anybody that would think that the oil 

1969
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:49,371
business knows exactly what they're 
doing and that this couldn't happen 

1970
01:20:49,371 --> 01:20:49,371
again.
It's crazy.

1971
01:20:49,371 --> 01:20:50,100
Just because it's only happened a few 
times in history,

1972
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,690
it doesn't mean that these things are 
deteriorating at a rapid pace and that,

1973
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:58,720
you know,
the ones that have been around for a 

1974
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,021
long time,
we don't know how long they're gonna 

1975
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:00,021
last things happen.

1976
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:00,270
Things fuck up,
you know the whole,

1977
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:02,710
there's other wells out there that are 
built like this one.

1978
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,650
They say,
you know,

1979
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,650
the whole deregulation thing.
It's so ridiculous.

1980
01:21:07,651 --> 01:21:09,540
Like what the market needs.
Deregulation.

1981
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:11,340
It's like,
it makes no sense.

1982
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,820
That's like saying we don't need laws 
because we'll just regulate each other.

1983
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:15,470
Well,
you know,

1984
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,740
we get crazy too and say,
look,

1985
01:21:16,741 --> 01:21:21,741
you know,
we need to lower the pressure labor to 

1986
01:21:21,741 --> 01:21:21,741
compete.
We have to go to China.

1987
01:21:21,741 --> 01:21:21,860
We have to go,
what the fuck are you talking?

1988
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,700
We don't have to at all.
No,

1989
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:28,760
you don't have to at all.
You just kind of stopped being too 

1990
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:28,760
greedy.
That's it.

1991
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,120
You're going to get less profit,
but you're going to get a fucking.

1992
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,120
What you're selling is a product that's 
not made on people.

1993
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:35,160
People's fucking souls.
You know,

1994
01:21:35,161 --> 01:21:40,161
you're,
you're going to sell a product that's 

1995
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:41,541
not poor people that live in a fucking 
village and in China and then they have 

1996
01:21:41,541 --> 01:21:43,500
to look at what was it,
Foxconn and we talk about all the time.

1997
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:46,170
It's fucking company that makes iphone 
parts and shit.

1998
01:21:46,171 --> 01:21:51,171
Dude.
They got people killing themselves left 

1999
01:21:51,171 --> 01:21:53,271
and right over there who left and right.
They're literally shutting down all 

2000
01:21:53,271 --> 01:21:54,780
their plants because there's so many 
suicides and there's so much scandal.

2001
01:21:55,050 --> 01:22:00,050
These people are working like God knows 
how many hours a day they're living on 

2002
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:00,050
the site.
You know?

2003
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:00,990
That's.
That's what companies are doing,

2004
01:22:00,991 --> 01:22:02,880
man.
Companies are going to people like that.

2005
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:07,970
That's the iphone too,
but Walmart's to worst to that company 

2006
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:08,070
makes the iphone.
Yeah.

2007
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:10,620
Or at least parts of the iphone.
No warrants the worst.

2008
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:11,370
Yeah,
man.

2009
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,150
[inaudible],
they go.

2010
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:15,930
They're like,
I don't believe that hype at all.

2011
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:20,990
I think Walmart does a lot.
Like you either can see that point of 

2012
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:25,250
yeah,
Walmart comes in and they don't pay 

2013
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,861
anything,
but I also see a walmart fucking 

2014
01:22:27,861 --> 01:22:28,490
striving for jobs and that go into these
towns.

2015
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:30,720
Really disagree with that.
It's like,

2016
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:35,870
first of all,
what they do is they keep driving down 

2017
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:38,751
the price and everything,
so eventually these people who produced 

2018
01:22:38,751 --> 01:22:41,040
the goods they buy are going to have to 
almost go to slave labor.

2019
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:46,190
I think it's either or.
I don't think either one of you guys is 

2020
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:46,190
right,
both right,

2021
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:50,420
but what what Walmart does is it comes 
in to a community and it basically has 

2022
01:22:51,121 --> 01:22:52,620
the lowest prices,
right?

2023
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:57,770
So it puts mom and pop stores the pops 
and all this stuff out and then seems 

2024
01:22:57,770 --> 01:23:01,180
like a good idea and they don't pay a 
real good wage to work there to what?

2025
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:06,240
Go to Walmart.
Like that person makes six bucks an 

2026
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:06,240
hour.
The other jobs gone.

2027
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:06,240
You got to go

2028
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:09,100
work somewhere.
But before that,

2029
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:11,970
before that,
there was no jobs that didn't exist.

2030
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:16,090
Those 300 jobs at blacksmith goes out of
business right here.

2031
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,760
But you know what the big thing is that 
retail is dead no matter what.

2032
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:20,770
So Walmart could be doing all they want 
to,

2033
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,350
but guess what?
Walmart ain't as cheap as fuck.

2034
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:24,610
And Amazon,
Amazon.

2035
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:27,670
Amazon is not his fucking growing like a
monster.

2036
01:23:27,671 --> 01:23:32,080
I buy groceries now on Amazon.
I'm buying coconut water by the case.

2037
01:23:32,081 --> 01:23:37,081
You know,
I don't even need to be a costco member 

2038
01:23:37,081 --> 01:23:37,081
or any of that because they sell the 
same shit now.

2039
01:23:37,081 --> 01:23:39,150
And you don't have to be a costco 
delivered to your house,

2040
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:44,220
they deliver it right to your house and 
you can put it on schedule like I want 

2041
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:44,220
this every two weeks,
you know,

2042
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:46,330
automatically ship going somewhere and 
buying something helps your community.

2043
01:23:46,331 --> 01:23:51,331
Would you do that to a point?
But I'm also not going to pay $300 more 

2044
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:52,460
for a fucking tv,
you know.

2045
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:53,930
And I'm like,
sorry,

2046
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,460
fucking think of what's next in your job
career.

2047
01:23:57,461 --> 01:24:00,190
If you can't sell this TV cheaper than 
this person,

2048
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:01,800
I'm not going to buy it simple.

2049
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:07,740
I don't think that people have an 
obligation to be able to continue to 

2050
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:11,401
sell you things.
I think if something comes along the 

2051
01:24:11,401 --> 01:24:11,401
consultings for much cheaper and at the 
same quality,

2052
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:12,810
if it's the same product.
Yeah,

2053
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:13,490
exactly.
I mean,

2054
01:24:13,491 --> 01:24:15,190
I,
I'm loyal to friends and I,

2055
01:24:15,191 --> 01:24:20,191
there's a couple of businesses that I 
support that I know charge more than 

2056
01:24:20,191 --> 01:24:21,310
they probably should for things like our
pot doctor,

2057
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,570
but I don't care,
you know,

2058
01:24:22,571 --> 01:24:24,610
it's just like I have a sense of loyalty
to them,

2059
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,880
but I've got some discretionary income 
if you don't man,

2060
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:30,720
300 bucks is a lot of fucking money.
And why would you pay $3?

2061
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:36,110
Was being generous.
That's 300 bucks plus no tax plus free 

2062
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:41,050
about that,
but just can't get the kind of deals 

2063
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:41,050
that Walmart can,
you know,

2064
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:41,500
tough shit man.
This,

2065
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:43,490
I think it's either or.
It's.

2066
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:44,740
I can see both points of view.

2067
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:49,740
I see Brian's point of view where it 
helps communities and it brings in jobs 

2068
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:52,981
and shit.
But I can see your point of view that 

2069
01:24:52,981 --> 01:24:52,981
it's like,
well,

2070
01:24:52,981 --> 01:24:52,990
you're given these people this mediocre 
life and they fucking.

2071
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:55,600
They don't really save jobs because they
put some businesses under.

2072
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:57,370
It's okay man.
It's all just change.

2073
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:58,780
Just normal.
You know?

2074
01:24:58,781 --> 01:24:59,970
There's no good or bad.
See,

2075
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,560
some people just aren't meant to be 
doctors and lawyers.

2076
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:06,200
And when you take away all their 
opportunities to like build stuff on,

2077
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,170
what else?
Is there a true though?

2078
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:08,830
No,
you don't.

2079
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:11,920
You just have to offer a service that 
other people aren't offering for less.

2080
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:12,890
It's not.
You can't

2081
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,000
just have to figure it out.
You have to figure to figure it out 

2082
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,270
because if whatever you're doing,
if Walmart can get it cheaper,

2083
01:25:18,271 --> 01:25:23,271
you have to figure out either how you 
could get it cheap or have a service 

2084
01:25:23,271 --> 01:25:23,271
that,
that Walmart doesn't work.

2085
01:25:23,271 --> 01:25:26,520
My family's been in this business for 30
fucking years.

2086
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,850
If you say it's okay for Walmart coming 
to our town where we grew up,

2087
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,010
you don't own the town,
you don't want a patch of dirt.

2088
01:25:32,011 --> 01:25:34,440
You don't own the rights to sell what 
you're saying about that.

2089
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:39,650
But it's like it goes back to like 
everybody's like capitalism and free 

2090
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:42,771
enterprise.
Well this isn't what it was like 200 

2091
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:42,771
years ago.
You know,

2092
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:45,780
when everything started to definitely 
says it was mom and pops.

2093
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:48,840
Now you got these huge corporations.
Like when,

2094
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:54,080
when the Supreme Court says that a huge 
corporation is like an individual,

2095
01:25:54,211 --> 01:25:57,720
while they're not a kazillion billion 
dollars behind them.

2096
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:02,400
You're talking about for a campaign 
contribution.

2097
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:04,010
Even in the

2098
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,120
market though,
you're like,

2099
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:08,510
we'll find a way to sell for less than 
Walmart.

2100
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:13,511
Well,
you never can because they buy in such 

2101
01:26:13,511 --> 01:26:13,511
huge.
Yeah.

2102
01:26:13,511 --> 01:26:16,000
But that's not even it down.
I was saying you didn't have to do that 

2103
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,580
or you have to find a new service at 
that Walmart doesn't offer like that.

2104
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,080
Like if you're selling phones.
All right.

2105
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:21,860
I will have a cell that you're the same 
phone.

2106
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:23,120
It's gonna be a little more.
But guess what,

2107
01:26:23,121 --> 01:26:24,740
I'm going to be coming to,
you know,

2108
01:26:24,741 --> 01:26:26,790
a tech support giving you this.
I'm going to,

2109
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:29,660
I'm gonna you know,
anytime you need to get a new computer,

2110
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:32,100
bring it in and I'll fucking transfer 
all your contacts over there.

2111
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:34,070
Fucking walmart ain't going to do that 
shit.

2112
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:36,950
You got to change with the Times.
You know what I mean?

2113
01:26:36,951 --> 01:26:39,440
These stores that I went in the other 
day too,

2114
01:26:39,441 --> 01:26:43,880
like this store and I bought a Webcam 
just because,

2115
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:44,500
uh,
the,

2116
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:47,060
the one at best buy,
they were sold out.

2117
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:47,870
So I just like,
all right,

2118
01:26:47,871 --> 01:26:50,180
I'll go to this little mom and pop 
electronic store.

2119
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,330
And they had like an old version of the 
Webcam.

2120
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:54,620
It was dusty,
you know,

2121
01:26:54,621 --> 01:26:55,730
I'm like,
I'm just sitting here going like,

2122
01:26:55,850 --> 01:27:00,850
this is an old product that a fuck.
It's the same price as the new product 

2123
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:01,490
at best buy.
But you know,

2124
01:27:01,491 --> 01:27:03,960
I didn't even want to even buy it 
because what?

2125
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:08,980
They can't even turn enough product to 
where they're shit they're selling is 

2126
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:10,000
outdated.
It's not current shit.

2127
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,570
And so I'm like,
that's a problem.

2128
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:16,690
It's not,
it's not Walmart's far as the change of 

2129
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:16,690
times.
It's Amazon,

2130
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:19,961
it's all this.
And if you think you're going to have a 

2131
01:27:19,961 --> 01:27:21,671
retail store in today's times,
you got to really fucking start using 

2132
01:27:21,671 --> 01:27:22,280
your brain because you need to offer a 
service that fucking,

2133
01:27:22,281 --> 01:27:24,620
I can't Amazon just going to kill you 
regardless.

2134
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:29,621
And then we're not even care about 
Walmart and Amazon's gonna kill Walmart 

2135
01:27:29,621 --> 01:27:29,621
eventually.

2136
01:27:29,621 --> 01:27:33,100
You know,
big corporations aren't killing all 

2137
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:35,021
businesses.
You're always gonna have like 

2138
01:27:35,021 --> 01:27:35,021
restaurants that are great restaurants 
because you know the cook is awesome.

2139
01:27:35,021 --> 01:27:36,200
He's always got interesting stuff to eat
there.

2140
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,030
You're not going to get that from some 
fucking chain.

2141
01:27:38,031 --> 01:27:39,680
You know,
some corporate chain you're going to get

2142
01:27:39,681 --> 01:27:42,560
like there's gonna be places of you're 
always going to want to go do that,

2143
01:27:42,561 --> 01:27:47,561
have personality to them to have flair 
that offer a certain environment or 

2144
01:27:47,561 --> 01:27:51,191
ambiance.
But as long as the way things are 

2145
01:27:51,191 --> 01:27:51,191
continuing to go,
the way they're going,

2146
01:27:51,191 --> 01:27:53,390
there's so many fucking people in this 
world.

2147
01:27:53,391 --> 01:27:56,840
There's so many people.
These corporations get so big because of

2148
01:27:56,841 --> 01:27:58,130
that.
There's so many,

2149
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:00,080
so many people to pull under.
You know,

2150
01:28:00,081 --> 01:28:05,081
there's so much to go after.
It doesn't seem like that's a trend 

2151
01:28:05,081 --> 01:28:05,320
that's going to stop.
I don't see the idea of us,

2152
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:10,321
you know,
going into little small groups and 

2153
01:28:10,321 --> 01:28:10,321
businesses and you know,
and goods being distributed like that.

2154
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,050
It's just going to continue to get 
bigger and bigger.

2155
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,380
What do you think of that woman who has 
like 25 kids?

2156
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:19,050
Which one is she should be shot?
Is that on that TV show now?

2157
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:21,260
There's a will.
There's one TV show,

2158
01:28:21,261 --> 01:28:24,750
the family that I was like 19,
21 or something,

2159
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:29,770
something like that.
I think that lady adopted this woman's 

2160
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:29,770
literally gave birth like,
oh,

2161
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:33,830
that lady gave birth.
The lady on the TV show really like 

2162
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:34,570
super religious,
whole family.

2163
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:39,610
Family's really cheesy,
but on a rigid schedule and serial 

2164
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:39,610
killers,
do you think are in their family?

2165
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:41,630
They're all cool.
They're all friendly.

2166
01:28:41,631 --> 01:28:46,631
They're all happy.
They're all looking at the sense of 

2167
01:28:46,631 --> 01:28:48,491
community they have down to a science.
I think serial killers come from 

2168
01:28:48,491 --> 01:28:49,740
loneliness and abandonment.
Religious.

2169
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:51,770
These people aren't abused.
They're.

2170
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,270
They seem happy.
You know what I mean?

2171
01:28:53,271 --> 01:28:55,250
They're,
they're little loony with the religion.

2172
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:55,440
Right.

2173
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:57,860
Have hot sex orgies and we don't even 
know about it,

2174
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:02,070
but 20,
25 years and how dare you,

2175
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,800
do you think they should like why do we 
need 25 of them?

2176
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:06,920
You know what man?
Here's what my deal is.

2177
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:11,990
Way Better to have 25 people that are 
nice and happy than 25 people that are 

2178
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:15,591
all fucked up and strung out on drugs 
and fucking angry and shooting people 

2179
01:29:15,591 --> 01:29:17,730
and whatever those people on that show.
I watched that show once the kids,

2180
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:20,320
they might be all ate up with Jesus,
but you know what?

2181
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:21,870
They're talking happy.
They're good people.

2182
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,790
They're good people too.
That whole Jesus thing,

2183
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:28,791
man is good for a lot of folks.
It's very whether or not you want to 

2184
01:29:28,791 --> 01:29:32,901
question whether or not you want to be 
objective about the source of all the 

2185
01:29:32,901 --> 01:29:33,630
stories that are in the Bible and 
whatever the bottom line is.

2186
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,870
Most Christians are trying to be nice 
people.

2187
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:38,250
Yeah,
that's what it's all about.

2188
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:38,920
It's a good thing,
man.

2189
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:42,540
Imagine them without religion,
stuff like that before,

2190
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:44,420
and people think I'm bullshitting and 
um,

2191
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:44,810
you know,
I'm,

2192
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,770
I'm patronizing people,
but I'm not.

2193
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:49,890
I think religion for a lot of people is 
a good thing.

2194
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,920
The idea behind it is all a good thing.
It's just believing that you've got the 

2195
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:55,860
fucking answers because you've committed
to it.

2196
01:29:56,010 --> 01:30:01,010
That's where the problem comes in.
The problem is when people get 

2197
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:01,010
aggressive with their,
their commitment,

2198
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:03,930
they have a commitment and you'll have 
to scratch my personal savior.

2199
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:09,160
How about the fucking guy that we were 
talking about them last week they went 

2200
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,451
to a.
he's in Afghanistan right now looking 

2201
01:30:11,451 --> 01:30:13,491
for Osama bin Ladin.
They arrested him 52 fucking years old 

2202
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:16,520
on dialysis.
This looney toons saving up all his 

2203
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:17,170
money and one of the reasons why he's 
going over there to kill Osama bin Ladin

2204
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:19,230
is because he said bad things about our 
God.

2205
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,420
Dude,
where are your friends?

2206
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:29,780
I just,
I don't trust anyone who's too into 

2207
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:29,970
anything to what it is.
Well,

2208
01:30:29,971 --> 01:30:33,060
even if I walk in and saw Jesus Christ 
or Brett Farve,

2209
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:35,360
whatever,
I'm like,

2210
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:37,230
okay,
you're fucking shady.

2211
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:38,580
Dude.
That's so true.

2212
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:40,750
People that are fucking obsessed with 
anything.

2213
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:45,770
Everything in moderation.
You can be obsessed with fucking 

2214
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:45,770
checkers.
Men.

2215
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:49,100
You can get obsessed with darts and you 
get obsessed with anything and it can 

2216
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:49,100
become your whole world.
You know?

2217
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:51,780
And if you get obsessed with Jesus and 
you want everybody to believe in Jesus,

2218
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:56,930
you believe in Jesus,
so you fucking want to run up to people 

2219
01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:57,570
on the street and hand them books and 
shit and tell them God.

2220
01:30:58,110 --> 01:30:59,970
Have you ever seen the movie king of 
Kong?

2221
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:01,500
No,
I heard it's awesome.

2222
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:04,140
Oh,
they're obsessed with video games.

2223
01:31:04,141 --> 01:31:08,910
It's great to do those people exist to 
real people.

2224
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:12,840
We used to be a part of a clan and I 
guess I still am.

2225
01:31:12,841 --> 01:31:14,190
You know,
you're in it for life.

2226
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:16,570
But clam detriment.
I,

2227
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:21,270
I used to play eight hours a day.
I got a t one line installed in my house

2228
01:31:21,271 --> 01:31:26,271
back when there was nothing else.
Well you can't get cable in my 

2229
01:31:26,271 --> 01:31:29,001
neighborhood.
You can get ISD n which is only like 

2230
01:31:29,001 --> 01:31:29,010
what is that 124 k or something like 
that.

2231
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,330
Not One hundred.
What is it?

2232
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:34,020
50 slash 40.
I never got into like twice 56 K,

2233
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:35,370
120 k,
something like that.

2234
01:31:35,371 --> 01:31:40,371
I think that's what I.
Sdn is maybe 140 and there wasn't 

2235
01:31:40,371 --> 01:31:44,211
enough.
You're paying your latency between 

2236
01:31:44,211 --> 01:31:44,211
service was too high,
so when you would play there'd be a lag.

2237
01:31:44,211 --> 01:31:46,370
It sucked.
So I had a fucking t one lines installed

2238
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:48,140
in my house,
a business line.

2239
01:31:48,141 --> 01:31:53,141
It's like a thousand dollars a month 
just so that I could play quake online 

2240
01:31:53,141 --> 01:31:54,120
because I was playing every day.
She see this new pain ray that the US is

2241
01:31:54,121 --> 01:31:56,550
testing in Afghanistan.
I heard about it.

2242
01:31:56,580 --> 01:32:00,520
It's like this big fucking like laser.
It's out like a microwave

2243
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:04,900
and it just makes you feel really hot.
It's going to be non lethal way for that

2244
01:32:04,901 --> 01:32:06,790
crowd control.
They're just going to start frying.

2245
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:08,790
Or with Micromedex,
they talked about that.

2246
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:11,860
I'm like 60 minutes and it was so 
interesting because they were like,

2247
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:17,400
you know,
they were demonstrating it and the 

2248
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:17,400
people they were using on where people 
were like,

2249
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,170
no war,
they had the no war sign.

2250
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:22,030
I'm like,
that's who you're going to use it on.

2251
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:24,130
Like they were old,
no size.

2252
01:32:24,131 --> 01:32:25,840
I'm like,
that's crazy dude.

2253
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,960
Oh my God.
I got through not using it right now.

2254
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:31,480
They just have it over there just in 
case this the.

2255
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:32,560
They want to use it

2256
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:36,040
looking actively at the beginning of the
Iraq war,

2257
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:41,070
I read a story online about coming up 
with some sort of a weapon to make men 

2258
01:32:41,771 --> 01:32:46,590
have gay feelings for each other to turn
it on the Iraqi troops they were,

2259
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:51,930
when we invaded Iraq,
they were going to somehow or another 

2260
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:52,010
come up with some sort of a weapon like 
they fucking spent money on,

2261
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,210
you know,
in Afghanistan.

2262
01:32:53,211 --> 01:32:56,060
They have man loved Thursdays.
I've heard of that.

2263
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:56,680
Yeah,
yeah,

2264
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,990
I've heard that there's a lot of sex 
going on over there.

2265
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:00,620
They,
uh,

2266
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:03,110
they,
uh,

2267
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:06,890
they think women are for reproduction,
mentor for pleasure.

2268
01:33:06,891 --> 01:33:10,460
And every Thursday they go into the 
mountains and they just asked,

2269
01:33:10,461 --> 01:33:14,370
blessed each other who had somebody.
A comic has a funny bit about that man.

2270
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:16,460
Where the fuck is that?
That's awful.

2271
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:21,490
Somebody went over to Afghanistan and 
actually saw some guys fucking each 

2272
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:21,490
other.
Well,

2273
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,940
it's like I was talking to some troops 
when I did a us over there and uh,

2274
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:30,340
you know,
they were trained in the Afghany troops 

2275
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:33,101
and like within their troop they had a 
boy there in the group whose whole job 

2276
01:33:33,101 --> 01:33:35,170
it was,
was the pleasure the guys and they,

2277
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:40,520
they had to tell the troops not the same
thing because that's their custom and 

2278
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:43,030
not to get involved with that stuff.
You're royal penises,

2279
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:48,040
clean tm.
I don't even know why we're fighting 

2280
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:48,040
over there,
man.

2281
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,250
You go over there like this is a shit 
hole.

2282
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:50,830
Yeah.

2283
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:53,540
We should just do the gdn and I hear 
what they just discovered.

2284
01:33:53,690 --> 01:33:56,690
They discovered well over 
$1,000,000,000,000

2285
01:33:56,691 --> 01:34:01,691
in mineral reserves,
previously unknown mineral reserves in 

2286
01:34:01,691 --> 01:34:02,120
Afghanistan.
Oh look,

2287
01:34:02,121 --> 01:34:03,620
we just discussed.
We didn't even know was here.

2288
01:34:03,621 --> 01:34:04,550
Wow.
Crazy.

2289
01:34:04,670 --> 01:34:05,800
Well,
since we're here,

2290
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:07,310
might as well start pulling the shit out
of the ground.

2291
01:34:07,730 --> 01:34:09,150
She's going to change.
Son.

2292
01:34:09,151 --> 01:34:10,590
Ever leave into.
Let me tell you some.

2293
01:34:10,591 --> 01:34:12,770
Afghanistan is going to be like Dubai in
20 years.

2294
01:34:12,771 --> 01:34:17,771
Okay.
We're going to have it over the whole 

2295
01:34:17,771 --> 01:34:20,111
fucking country.
It's going to be democratized and 

2296
01:34:20,111 --> 01:34:20,390
they'll have 2 million mile high 
buildings.

2297
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:25,400
Okay.
There's a trillion dollars worth of 

2298
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:25,520
minerals there that's going to be this 
crazy mining town.

2299
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:30,700
It's just like how we need gold with 
these minerals we need for making 

2300
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:31,980
semiconductors and all kinds of other 
shit that we,

2301
01:34:32,010 --> 01:34:32,570
we,
you know,

2302
01:34:32,571 --> 01:34:35,600
we use things for,
to construct stuff,

2303
01:34:35,601 --> 01:34:37,130
you know,
especially high tech stuff.

2304
01:34:37,131 --> 01:34:38,120
We use a lot of minerals.

2305
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:40,540
It's like a trillion dollars worth of 
stuff.

2306
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:44,120
That's a thousand billion.
It's a lot of Sun.

2307
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:49,600
Dude.
Shit's going to get Chris to do a joke 

2308
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,251
about.
The only person who could run Iraq is 

2309
01:34:51,251 --> 01:34:53,360
magic Johnson because you know,
he made like almost a billion dollars in

2310
01:34:53,361 --> 01:34:57,980
like just redoing like apartments,
all that stuff.

2311
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,660
And like,
you know,

2312
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:04,700
give them like two weeks.
Fucking Baghdad would look like fucking 

2313
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,200
Orange County and whoever you put in 
charge in there,

2314
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:07,940
they're going to try to assassinate 
anyways.

2315
01:35:07,941 --> 01:35:12,941
And you know,
we all know you can't kill Magic 

2316
01:35:12,941 --> 01:35:12,941
Johnson.
Somebody tried.

2317
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:15,680
So it's been a while since I did that 
joke.

2318
01:35:15,681 --> 01:35:20,500
I couldn't remember how it went.
CIA planned to bomb Iraq with Saddam.

2319
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:21,710
Gave video.
Oh,

2320
01:35:21,711 --> 01:35:23,420
that's different than.
We're going to make a fake.

2321
01:35:23,421 --> 01:35:24,650
Gave video.
That's funny.

2322
01:35:24,651 --> 01:35:26,630
The CIA did Photoshop.
Can you imagine?

2323
01:35:26,631 --> 01:35:31,190
We like like auditioning for that.
The US army soldier.

2324
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:32,780
When you do to take down your pants.
I'll fuck this guy.

2325
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:33,650
Yeah.
What do they do?

2326
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,810
Kill you afterwards.
They,

2327
01:35:35,811 --> 01:35:38,750
if they're going to make a fucking fake 
Saddam Hussein video,

2328
01:35:38,751 --> 01:35:43,751
they can't let you go.
If you're the type of person that's 

2329
01:35:43,751 --> 01:35:44,540
willing to make a fake gay Saddam 
Hussein video,

2330
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:49,600
they can't trust you to keep your 
fucking mouth shut at the government 

2331
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:49,600
paid you.

2332
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:49,600
They're going to kill you,
man.

2333
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:49,900
Well,
unless they kind of like a hey,

2334
01:35:49,901 --> 01:35:51,020
you know,
we let you in.

2335
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:52,670
You just need to like don't ask,
don't tell.

2336
01:35:52,671 --> 01:35:54,950
But,
but we have a special program for what?

2337
01:35:54,951 --> 01:35:57,380
You get to be a soldier.
Lucky you.

2338
01:35:57,381 --> 01:36:00,290
You get to go get shot at after we went 
to suck cock on video.

2339
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,510
What a fucking gift.
Listen man,

2340
01:36:02,511 --> 01:36:04,820
I think they'd probably kill you.
I think they'd probably say,

2341
01:36:04,821 --> 01:36:05,660
listen,
we're going to do some gay.

2342
01:36:05,661 --> 01:36:10,661
Porn is going to be crazy.
It's we're going to pretend it's Osama 

2343
01:36:10,661 --> 01:36:10,661
bin Laden,
or Saddam was saying or whatever.

2344
01:36:10,661 --> 01:36:14,690
And I met this guy,
doesn't even know he's doing it for the 

2345
01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:14,690
military,
thinks he's doing a Persian look.

2346
01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:19,630
They shoot everybody in the fucking head
and throw them in the ocean and they 

2347
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:19,630
just disappeared.
No one ever hears about it.

2348
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:22,700
That's fucking fucking surrounds Zmq 
chicken.

2349
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,080
Alright everybody out.
You know,

2350
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:29,090
this general that just stepped up and 
said all kinds of crazy shit about 

2351
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:29,090
Obama.
And you know,

2352
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:30,050
there's Tris I think is,
I don't know what the fuck his name is.

2353
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:31,060
He,
um,

2354
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,440
they just made them resign.
So he resigned.

2355
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:37,400
It turns out this is the same guy that 
signed off on the Pat Tillman story.

2356
01:36:37,401 --> 01:36:40,700
He was trying to get everybody to 
believe it's Pat Tillman was died by the

2357
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:43,100
fighting the enemy when actually was 
killed by friendly fire.

2358
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:44,810
Same fucking dude.
He's an asshole.

2359
01:36:44,811 --> 01:36:46,080
He's like,
he goes over there,

2360
01:36:46,081 --> 01:36:47,990
it basically tells the troops,
uh,

2361
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:51,080
this is going like shit.
And it's like you're the guy who came up

2362
01:36:51,081 --> 01:36:52,760
with a plan,
who you blame him.

2363
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:54,560
He,
there's a lot of speculation.

2364
01:36:54,590 --> 01:36:59,590
I always listened to Opie and Anthony 
today and people were calling in and 

2365
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:00,050
talking about it and they were saying 
that they think that he might have tried

2366
01:37:00,051 --> 01:37:00,610
to,
uh,

2367
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:04,040
he wanted to leave and he,
this was the way he could not just leave

2368
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:06,200
but leave and get his point across,
you know,

2369
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:07,970
that he calculated this and did it on 
purpose.

2370
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:12,970
So he made this big statement about them
because he knew it was going to be in 

2371
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:14,370
rolling stone and then he gets fired,
right?

2372
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:16,970
Or gets forced to resign,
but then this issue,

2373
01:37:16,971 --> 01:37:21,971
whatever he said,
gets out there across the whole world 

2374
01:37:21,971 --> 01:37:21,971
because of the fact that he opened his 
mouth and in rolling stone and that they

2375
01:37:21,971 --> 01:37:26,891
reacted and that they fired him.
This becomes an issue that people want 

2376
01:37:26,891 --> 01:37:30,251
to hear more about.
So then he gets a fucking book deal and 

2377
01:37:30,251 --> 01:37:30,251
he'd get a book deal for several million
dollars.

2378
01:37:30,251 --> 01:37:31,640
If you're fucking smart,
he'll be on Fox News.

2379
01:37:32,010 --> 01:37:34,700
If it's legal.
I don't know what the legality is as far

2380
01:37:34,701 --> 01:37:39,701
as like what you're allowed to talk 
about when you're allowed to talk about 

2381
01:37:39,701 --> 01:37:39,701
it.
When you're a high level military guy,

2382
01:37:39,701 --> 01:37:41,000
you know,
in the United States army like he is,

2383
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:43,340
but I would think that that would be a 
fucking smooth move.

2384
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:44,960
You know,
when you think.

2385
01:37:44,970 --> 01:37:46,070
I mean,
why just fucking quit?

2386
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,570
You don't like it.
You don't like Obama.

2387
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:50,390
Why quit?
Why not just make a stink mega stank?

2388
01:37:50,391 --> 01:37:51,950
Everybody knows you made a stink.
Write a book,

2389
01:37:51,951 --> 01:37:53,840
Bam sign.
You know,

2390
01:37:54,130 --> 01:37:56,130
just need a little fame baby.
Keep that ball rolling.

2391
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,880
Well,
I mean look at Sarah Palin.

2392
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:03,200
Exactly.
I was just gonna say that still in the 

2393
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:05,151
game.
So on that fucking election was two 

2394
01:38:05,151 --> 01:38:05,151
years ago.
She was retarded.

2395
01:38:05,151 --> 01:38:06,990
Then she's still in the mix,
making millions,

2396
01:38:07,190 --> 01:38:12,190
making bank.
They're doing some crazy reality shows 

2397
01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:15,470
series on hers,
like eight episodes for a million 

2398
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:15,470
dollars a pop.
I'm a POW POW,

2399
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:15,470
POW.

2400
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:16,320
That's why she got out.
She like,

2401
01:38:16,330 --> 01:38:21,010
I can't get money in sign raking day in 
Alaska.

2402
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:21,410
I did.

2403
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:24,190
There is money and keeping the retards 
happy.

2404
01:38:24,191 --> 01:38:26,230
She is the politics version of pro 
wrestling.

2405
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:31,470
If you go to watch pro wrestling,
there are thousands of people in those 

2406
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:31,470
stands and they're having a good fucking
time.

2407
01:38:31,690 --> 01:38:36,690
That bitch is the.
She's a female politician version of a 

2408
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:40,291
pro wrestler.
She says a bunch of retarded shit that 

2409
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:40,480
only retards agree with.
She riles them up.

2410
01:38:40,481 --> 01:38:43,210
They don't even know what she likes.
They know what she stands for.

2411
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:48,270
She stands for someone who's not going 
to think too much sense for someone 

2412
01:38:48,270 --> 01:38:48,880
who's going to give basic values.
We're just gonna.

2413
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:53,870
Get down on how's that whole hopey,
changey thing working out for you.

2414
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:59,030
You know she.
She prides herself on being goofy and 

2415
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:02,191
people like that shit.
They connect to it and you're always 

2416
01:39:02,191 --> 01:39:02,191
gonna.
Have that man.

2417
01:39:02,191 --> 01:39:02,380
You're always gonna.
Have that.

2418
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,390
You're always going to have someone 
steps up like that.

2419
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:06,070
You're always going to have someone to.
If you,

2420
01:39:06,071 --> 01:39:09,250
if you all have to do is just get 
yourself into the zeitgeists.

2421
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:14,280
Get people,
start thinking about you and then keep 

2422
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:14,280
going and you can make a living off it.
Man,

2423
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:14,920
they're fucking professional trolls.

2424
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,260
Tomi,
me and cultures,

2425
01:39:18,290 --> 01:39:23,250
not a professional troll right on TV.
I want the bone or.

2426
01:39:23,251 --> 01:39:24,170
Dude,
did you really?

2427
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:26,030
Yeah,
she's actually looking pretty hot.

2428
01:39:26,110 --> 01:39:27,110
Oh,
Sam triply.

2429
01:39:27,111 --> 01:39:30,620
How long does it.
I want to fuck the right out of her now.

2430
01:39:30,621 --> 01:39:34,940
You need to start drinking again.
You're getting beer goggles.

2431
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:37,190
That's what I've heard.

2432
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:40,700
This is incredible.
This really is true sex bomb.

2433
01:39:40,701 --> 01:39:44,000
Those who complain,
the military should make love not war.

2434
01:39:44,001 --> 01:39:46,310
May Be happy to know that at least on 
one occasion,

2435
01:39:46,311 --> 01:39:51,311
the military scientists were searching 
for ways to break down the enemy with 

2436
01:39:51,311 --> 01:39:53,120
aching desire,
a sex bomb,

2437
01:39:53,121 --> 01:39:58,121
or in saucier headlines,
the gay bomb scientists consider 

2438
01:39:58,121 --> 01:40:01,091
developing a chemical weapon with 
Aphrodisiac qualities that would make 

2439
01:40:01,091 --> 01:40:04,961
the enemy soldiers hopelessly physically
attracted to one another as to paralyze 

2440
01:40:05,211 --> 01:40:07,220
their ranks and destroy morale.
Isn't that good?

2441
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:11,000
Credible scientists wizard like some 18 
year old guy from high school.

2442
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:16,020
I'm a scientist.
I'm going to make some gay bombs out 

2443
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:16,020
there.
You know,

2444
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:20,440
that's what the Pentagon hires.
It's not like they have access to the 

2445
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:20,440
best sign,
but they just said they talked about it.

2446
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:21,620
They didn't actually do anything.
Listen to you,

2447
01:40:21,621 --> 01:40:22,940
man.
You don't even want to believe.

2448
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:25,940
I believe they actually tried.
I do.

2449
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:31,020
I believe.
I believe I don't put it past the 

2450
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:33,071
Pentagon,
but I also find it like if they even 

2451
01:40:33,071 --> 01:40:33,071
were thinking about that,
they probably just said move.

2452
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,510
We could make a bomb.
Maybe that's good.

2453
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:35,180
All right,
that's cool.

2454
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:36,520
They'll try and say,
hey,

2455
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:39,230
they're saying aphrodisiacs right.
When they were together with men

2456
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:44,390
and there was only men around,
they wouldn't be able to help 

2457
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:44,390
themselves.
That's the idea,

2458
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:44,390
right?
You know,

2459
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:46,990
look man,
if you break down what sexual desire is,

2460
01:40:46,991 --> 01:40:50,740
there must be some sort of a trigger in 
our brains for sexual desire,

2461
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:51,790
you know,
whatever it is,

2462
01:40:51,791 --> 01:40:54,100
some sort of a chemical trigger.
If they can

2463
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:59,130
mimic that and find a way to get it into
people blast blasted out in a haze and 

2464
01:40:59,130 --> 01:41:00,760
you inhale it as you breathe and all of 
a sudden you can.

2465
01:41:01,010 --> 01:41:06,010
Thing they would do though is sell it.
The first thing they would do though is 

2466
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,280
they would be making money off that like
oil.

2467
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,890
Why would they sell?
They knew as porn ever.

2468
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:14,320
Why would they sell it when they can 
make x amount of money from it?

2469
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:19,500
When they could use it and take over 
countries they could take over task to 

2470
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:20,440
fucking countries.
Okay,

2471
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:22,810
and why would you sell it?
Because if you sold it then other people

2472
01:41:22,811 --> 01:41:24,820
would have access to it.
If you're going to use it.

2473
01:41:24,821 --> 01:41:25,900
If the military is gonna,
use it.

2474
01:41:25,901 --> 01:41:26,660
They're not going to,
you know,

2475
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:28,750
the military is not going to turn into 
some sort of fucking,

2476
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:31,530
you know,
a vendor start selling some product.

2477
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,770
You're going to have late night 
commercials.

2478
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:37,630
The theory that like the Samurais were 
the days.

2479
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:44,220
That's why they fought.
So I got my tattoo on my arm son 

2480
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:47,760
respect.
So just don't talk because it has so 

2481
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:51,071
much come in their mouth.
That's why pirates pirates dress 

2482
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:52,400
flamboyantly flamboyantly you know the 
word they're all gay stop plants on.

2483
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:55,050
Yeah.
That's was wearing.

2484
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:57,610
Who the fuck else was wearing earrings 
and shit back then?

2485
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:02,640
Big Sashes and fucking pirates were 
super gay and flamboyant silk shirts.

2486
01:42:04,271 --> 01:42:09,271
We're not taught.
Vikings and pirates aren't the same 

2487
01:42:09,271 --> 01:42:09,271
thing.
Sam,

2488
01:42:09,271 --> 01:42:11,581
Sam tripling.
They're both on both our Nordic 

2489
01:42:11,581 --> 01:42:11,581
warriors.
They're not gay,

2490
01:42:11,581 --> 01:42:11,581
they're fucking savages.
They.

2491
01:42:11,581 --> 01:42:16,480
That's why Nordic chicks are so hot 
because they raped and pillaged all the 

2492
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:16,660
best ones.
They took everything they could find.

2493
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:19,960
Just pure Alpha Male,
Arctic lust,

2494
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:24,990
big fucking white Dicks of death,
just plundering and raping across the 

2495
01:42:24,990 --> 01:42:24,990
world.

2496
01:42:24,990 --> 01:42:29,790
Big Difference between that.
Pirates pirates are sucking Dick and 

2497
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:32,431
wearing sashes.
They got crazy fucking patches over 

2498
01:42:32,431 --> 01:42:32,431
their eyes.
Rainbow Birds,

2499
01:42:32,431 --> 01:42:33,240
birds,
rainbow.

2500
01:42:33,241 --> 01:42:34,480
What kind of bird?
Look at that.

2501
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:39,481
Pirates are associated with parents.
What kind of a dude walks around with a 

2502
01:42:39,481 --> 01:42:39,840
parent on shoulder?
A gay guy is sure.

2503
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,670
If you see a dude with a parrot on his 
shoulder,

2504
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:44,350
he's.
Something's happened to him.

2505
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:49,500
You know?
Maybe a dude made him jerk him off once 

2506
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,691
and he's fucking frozen patches.
Hate guys do magic tricks at House 

2507
01:42:52,421 --> 01:42:53,920
parties.
Ooh,

2508
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:59,460
that's rough.
I just went to the best house party 

2509
01:42:59,460 --> 01:42:59,460
their day at South Park.
Had a house party and I went to it.

2510
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:01,180
It was amazing.
Dude,

2511
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:06,330
you have not been to a party until 
you've been to one of these south park 

2512
01:43:06,330 --> 01:43:06,330
parties.
He ever been to one.

2513
01:43:06,330 --> 01:43:08,350
Joe Did.
They probably spent like maybe $10,000

2514
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:13,470
on just decorations,
like you walk in and you felt like you 

2515
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:15,190
were in Moulin Rouge,
like a circus or something like that.

2516
01:43:15,190 --> 01:43:18,260
They had fucking shooting galleries like
a,

2517
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:21,430
like a carnival and stuff.
Those guys really have it done.

2518
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,860
They're doing it right.
Those south park guys,

2519
01:43:23,950 --> 01:43:25,030
everything they do,
I love.

2520
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:30,240
Every time they put something out on 
level of America up the movie south 

2521
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:31,030
parking lot.
They were opening for tool.

2522
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:35,830
What dvds they would run the a cartoon 
before tool came out.

2523
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:41,160
Oh,
you're talking about the Brian Boitano 

2524
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:41,160
one,
right?

2525
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:41,160
Yeah.
The Brian Boitano one was the first.

2526
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,540
Someone gave me that under the Christmas
card back when I was living in fucking.

2527
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:45,260
I was living in Encino.
He was like,

2528
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,750
God damn,
this is funny shit.

2529
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:49,810
And then it became a show,
but every one of them will have that vhs

2530
01:43:49,811 --> 01:43:52,110
tape because he could probably Ebay

2531
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:56,330
that.
I might have bills y'all.

2532
01:43:56,331 --> 01:44:00,410
I got a stack of old vhs tapes that may 
or may not be interesting.

2533
01:44:00,990 --> 01:44:02,600
I found a few of them the other day,
but I'm like,

2534
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:03,950
you know what?
All this shit is online,

2535
01:44:03,951 --> 01:44:07,870
so they sent it out as a Christmas card 
through paramount or something like that

2536
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:11,420
and not many people got that vhs tapes.
I'm sorry.

2537
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:15,530
I fucking love the South Park movie.
That was just genius shit.

2538
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,140
Team America is my favorite all time 
movie of all time I think.

2539
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:18,950
Yeah,
tea.

2540
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:20,480
My favorite.
One of my funniest,

2541
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:22,280
the funniest movie I've ever seen for 
sure,

2542
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:24,430
but the thing about south park was when 
Saddam Hussein,

2543
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:28,190
when they had Saddam saying being gay 
with the devil and remember he had a big

2544
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:33,191
rubber Dick and so funny that I saw that
movie in a theater full of Mexicans when

2545
01:44:35,961 --> 01:44:38,270
they called God the biggest bitch of a 
mall.

2546
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:42,650
You just felt the room energy turn.
They got mad.

2547
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,600
Oh yeah.
Hilarious.

2548
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:45,990
Like what?
They're did Mohammed,

2549
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:51,060
you need to get camp.
When I was at that party at for a brief 

2550
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:51,060
second,
I'm like,

2551
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:54,160
Oh yeah,
that might be a bomb here is that many 

2552
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:57,290
people were threatening their lives.
They really were worried about that.

2553
01:44:57,430 --> 01:45:02,430
The people were threatening their lives 
because they were making fun of 

2554
01:45:02,430 --> 01:45:05,020
Mohammed.
What they saying that the time square 

2555
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:07,361
guy,
it was something the time square guy 

2556
01:45:07,361 --> 01:45:07,361
sounds like he's retarded.
You know,

2557
01:45:07,361 --> 01:45:11,840
we talked to people that know bombs and 
understand construction of bombs and 

2558
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:14,861
like this could have never worked.
Like the whole bunch of things work 

2559
01:45:14,861 --> 01:45:14,861
exactly.
Perfect in order.

2560
01:45:14,861 --> 01:45:16,610
He didn't have any experience doing it,
set it up wrong,

2561
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:17,360
you know,
they're like,

2562
01:45:17,361 --> 01:45:22,361
this is all wrong.
So He seems like it's just a fucking 

2563
01:45:22,361 --> 01:45:22,361
retard that they had over there.

2564
01:45:22,361 --> 01:45:23,540
Disenfranchise God,
losing his house,

2565
01:45:23,541 --> 01:45:25,270
you know,
that kind of a guy and you know,

2566
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:28,730
just wants something to connect 
themselves to something significant.

2567
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,260
So he decides he's going to be a martyr 
and you know,

2568
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:35,990
like when they came up to on the plane 
he asked them if they were FBI or CIA.

2569
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:37,400
He asked them what they were in New 
York,

2570
01:45:37,410 --> 01:45:39,740
priests,
New York police or CIA or FBI.

2571
01:45:39,741 --> 01:45:41,150
What are you?
He wanted to know.

2572
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:42,490
He want to know who is getting arrested 
bias.

2573
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,960
If you wanted to get fucking caught,
here's a dumb ass.

2574
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:50,140
So I think there are groups out there 
that are trying to do fucked up shit to 

2575
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:50,390
Americans for sure.
There definitely are.

2576
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:52,430
But the thing is the dudes who are 
joining these things,

2577
01:45:52,431 --> 01:45:53,870
they're fucking mess,
man.

2578
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:54,770
Yeah,
they're idiots.

2579
01:45:54,870 --> 01:45:59,870
They're,
they're either idiots or they're all 

2580
01:45:59,870 --> 01:45:59,990
fucked up or nobody's signing up to do 
this shit.

2581
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:01,550
If they got it all together,
you know,

2582
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,300
the key to making the world safe is not 
killing all the fucked up people.

2583
01:46:05,301 --> 01:46:08,120
It's making sure that people coming up,
get it together,

2584
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:12,560
do your best to make sure there's plenty
of cool people do your best to make sure

2585
01:46:12,561 --> 01:46:17,561
the kids are raised correctly,
that you just set up good schools and 

2586
01:46:17,561 --> 01:46:19,730
community centers and do things to try 
to enhance the lives of children,

2587
01:46:19,731 --> 01:46:21,610
to make them grow up to be more positive
people.

2588
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:26,630
That's the only way to fix this.
How are you going to do that when they 

2589
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:26,630
just keep pulling money out of 
education?

2590
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:28,030
I mean it's like this,
you know,

2591
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:29,900
there's not enough incentive to them.
They're rich,

2592
01:46:29,901 --> 01:46:31,610
rich people put their kids in private 
schools.

2593
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:32,500
So they look at,
you know,

2594
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:34,130
the situation like this other people's 
problem,

2595
01:46:34,131 --> 01:46:35,240
fuck them,
you know,

2596
01:46:35,241 --> 01:46:38,540
but it's your problem to manage those 
kids grow up and they're disenfranchised

2597
01:46:38,541 --> 01:46:40,090
and fucking dangerous,
you know,

2598
01:46:40,150 --> 01:46:45,150
if your children have to come in contact
with you now if you go to like places 

2599
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:46,400
like Australia,
Canada,

2600
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:51,090
where it's like one group of people,
they seem to be more like a group.

2601
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:56,090
Do you know what I'm saying?
That working together and I love the 

2602
01:46:56,090 --> 01:46:56,090
diversity of America,
but I wonder if that plays in,

2603
01:46:56,410 --> 01:47:01,410
you know,
it's Kinda what I was talking to you on 

2604
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:02,721
the phone.
Like when you send it like all the 

2605
01:47:02,721 --> 01:47:02,721
savages and all that stuff.
Seminar on the way over here,

2606
01:47:02,721 --> 01:47:07,401
we were talking about why America,
we were talking about how great Canada 

2607
01:47:07,401 --> 01:47:07,401
is.
Every time we go up to Canada,

2608
01:47:07,401 --> 01:47:08,460
which I just got back,
I was just,

2609
01:47:08,461 --> 01:47:11,070
uh,
this weekend I was in a three stops can.

2610
01:47:11,110 --> 01:47:16,110
I was in grand prairie.
I was in saskatoon and then I was in 

2611
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:19,020
saskatoon.
Grandparent in Winnipeg had a great 

2612
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:19,020
fucking time.
Man,

2613
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:19,020
shows are so much fun.
I can love Canada.

2614
01:47:19,210 --> 01:47:20,860
I love.
Awesome up there man.

2615
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:25,940
Montreal was awesome.
It's just like there's something about 

2616
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:25,940
these people that are,
they're so nice.

2617
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:29,040
It's such a great,
like there's so much like on a,

2618
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:33,210
on the whole somewhat friendlier and,
and in more relaxed than Americans.

2619
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:34,790
Look in their eyes.
You don't see darkness.

2620
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,770
You see rainbows,
Douche bags.

2621
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:38,420
You mean there's Douche bags everywhere.
You know,

2622
01:47:38,430 --> 01:47:40,410
I had a lot of douchebags in Winnipeg,
a lot of hecklers,

2623
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:43,050
but they're just drunk and retarded.
That's part of life.

2624
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:48,110
Whatever you.
Whatever you did just made the static 

2625
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:48,110
come back.
I just moved.

2626
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:48,110
We got a rinky dink system here,
son.

2627
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:48,110
Yeah.

2628
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:51,620
Okay.

2629
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:56,250
I shut my mic off and it's doing it man.
So can't be uh,

2630
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:59,260
so uh,
try to try to figure out what this is.

2631
01:47:59,350 --> 01:48:04,350
It's,
it's something over there because I was 

2632
01:48:04,350 --> 01:48:06,751
fine.
And then you move that stand out as a 

2633
01:48:06,751 --> 01:48:06,751
stand,
touching a metal.

2634
01:48:06,751 --> 01:48:08,350
Try to get comfortable liquid.
It's almost near the end anyway.

2635
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:09,510
Yeah.
But wait a minute,

2636
01:48:09,511 --> 01:48:10,920
we can't just keep talking like this 
bro.

2637
01:48:10,921 --> 01:48:13,470
We started it four slash 15.
We got 15 more minutes.

2638
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:16,780
Don't turn my volume down.
I'm just saying can hear my that twice.

2639
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:19,420
Don't be fucking with them.
You sign it.

2640
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:20,160
Somebody should.
I do.

2641
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:23,100
Should I unplug and replug unplugging.
Implement.

2642
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:23,670
What to do,
Brian.

2643
01:48:24,650 --> 01:48:25,840
There's nothing over there.
It's nothing over there.

2644
01:48:25,841 --> 01:48:26,830
Don't touch anything over there.
No,

2645
01:48:26,831 --> 01:48:27,070
no,
no.

2646
01:48:27,071 --> 01:48:28,330
Don't.
I don't know.

2647
01:48:29,230 --> 01:48:32,200
Yeah.
It's something over in that mic stand or

2648
01:48:32,201 --> 01:48:37,201
your mic.
Because the only thing you did is you 

2649
01:48:37,201 --> 01:48:37,201
touched the mic.
Stand it.

2650
01:48:37,201 --> 01:48:37,201
Turn back those move.
I'll just move.

2651
01:48:37,201 --> 01:48:39,170
It's like some kind of done that

2652
01:48:39,810 --> 01:48:41,670
rinky dink.
Fucking bullshit.

2653
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:43,850
If I was listening to this on an ipad.
Okay.

2654
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:45,070
Be pissed right now.
Come on.

2655
01:48:45,071 --> 01:48:45,880
We gotta fix it.
Take,

2656
01:48:45,910 --> 01:48:48,330
take.
Take the mick out of the Stan.

2657
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:50,440
Turn off the mic so you don't blow 
everyone's ears.

2658
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:53,140
I'll unplug it and hit the mic.
Stand on the ground.

2659
01:48:53,830 --> 01:48:56,290
Not too hard or know that the Michael 
Stopped.

2660
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,460
No,
because it's unplugged.

2661
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:00,910
You're unplugged it.
So now I'll take that mic though and hit

2662
01:49:00,911 --> 01:49:02,080
it on the ground.
Tap It on the ground.

2663
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:02,690
See?
It's bad.

2664
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:05,360
It's the mic.
Uh,

2665
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:07,980
why?
Why would a tap that?

2666
01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:08,610
No,
no,

2667
01:49:08,611 --> 01:49:09,250
no,
no.

2668
01:49:09,251 --> 01:49:10,750
The mic.
You know what?

2669
01:49:10,751 --> 01:49:12,370
I mean like if it's a loose connection 
or something,

2670
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:20,200
so it's like blowing into the Nintendo 
disc control.

2671
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,160
Okay.
You know,

2672
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:25,690
I believe it's something to do with that
Mike or the cable that the link is.

2673
01:49:26,890 --> 01:49:29,920
Damn it.
How's it connecting brand?

2674
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:32,020
It's just gone right here.
I've heard there.

2675
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:33,150
I did already.
That

2676
01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:38,150
what you put me in another whole pulling
out of the hole over there.

2677
01:49:38,970 --> 01:49:39,110
It's

2678
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:40,020
not that.
It's.

2679
01:49:40,050 --> 01:49:42,310
It has something to do with.
Oh wait,

2680
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,720
now there's just no sound.
Is that one one?

2681
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:45,390
There we go.
No,

2682
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:46,380
no.
Sound crackle.

2683
01:49:46,890 --> 01:49:48,130
Say it's something on

2684
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:50,190
that side where the mic is.
Okay.

2685
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:53,800
Let's ignore it because knowing is for 
listening to this shit.

2686
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:59,340
These fucking faggots just talked about 
the sound buzz for 30 seconds and I 

2687
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:03,700
think they can hear it.
Only we can hear it because you're that 

2688
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:07,590
much because the compression three years
during probably blocks out that that had

2689
01:50:07,610 --> 01:50:08,650
with the itunes.
People are gonna.

2690
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:10,360
Hear this shit up.
I'll try to fix it.

2691
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:12,400
Sorry folks.
Very interesting.

2692
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:15,390
Well you were talking about savages.
Yeah.

2693
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:20,400
We were talking about.
This is what Sam triple and I were 

2694
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,411
talking about on the way over here.
We were talking about why is America so 

2695
01:50:22,411 --> 01:50:22,411
aggressive?
And we're saying,

2696
01:50:22,411 --> 01:50:23,920
well you think about it,
just the people that came to America are

2697
01:50:23,921 --> 01:50:26,110
the people that were so fed up with 
Europe.

2698
01:50:26,111 --> 01:50:31,111
There were so ambitious that they got on
a fucking boat and sailed across oceans 

2699
01:50:31,111 --> 01:50:31,111
to get over here.

2700
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:36,260
They put themselves through serious,
the most aggressive of the aggressive 

2701
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:36,260
and once they got here,
you know,

2702
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:39,400
they were desperado and a lot of them 
got here during the depression or before

2703
01:50:39,401 --> 01:50:40,390
the depression.
You know,

2704
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:43,170
a lot of them got here back then and 
those fucking people do.

2705
01:50:43,210 --> 01:50:44,910
The people grew up in the depression,
you know,

2706
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:47,080
they had a fuck.
They were fucking hard people,

2707
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:47,980
man.
Those were hard,

2708
01:50:47,981 --> 01:50:52,981
hard times.
You hear stories about soup lines and 

2709
01:50:52,981 --> 01:50:53,180
whole families being outside and you 
know,

2710
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:54,610
I mean you see some of the photos from 
the,

2711
01:50:54,611 --> 01:50:56,530
from the depression era.
That was scary,

2712
01:50:56,531 --> 01:51:01,531
scary shit for people.
So those people grew up hard and they 

2713
01:51:01,531 --> 01:51:02,830
grew up aggressive and those are the 
ones that stayed and they had kids.

2714
01:51:02,831 --> 01:51:05,020
And then they had kids and that fucking 
aggressive,

2715
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:08,410
aggressive attitude of survival.
It's still still there.

2716
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:08,800
You know.

2717
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:14,430
And then that's one of the reasons why 
we've talked about this before about 

2718
01:51:14,430 --> 01:51:17,431
California so weird is because all the 
people that were dissatisfied with the 

2719
01:51:17,431 --> 01:51:20,731
east coast,
they're all slowly made their way 

2720
01:51:20,731 --> 01:51:20,731
further and further and further and 
further west.

2721
01:51:20,731 --> 01:51:25,350
And you mix them with people just want 
fame and they know that the most 

2722
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:28,441
aggressive be aggressive.
La has got to be the freakiest fucking 

2723
01:51:28,441 --> 01:51:32,251
place to live ever.
I think it's gotta be like Hollywood 

2724
01:51:32,251 --> 01:51:34,740
Wall Street and then Washington dc 
because you just see the um,

2725
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:36,550
did you see the,
the Laker game thing,

2726
01:51:36,551 --> 01:51:38,440
but they were lighting.
The car's on fire after it was over.

2727
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:41,350
Yeah.
They're so angry about that.

2728
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:44,170
And it wasn't even like a cop car or a 
government car.

2729
01:51:44,171 --> 01:51:47,410
It was a fucking cab.
And you know what I'm saying?

2730
01:51:47,980 --> 01:51:49,180
I'm not going to go there.
Nevermind.

2731
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:50,330
Go.
Where am I?

2732
01:51:50,330 --> 01:51:51,640
Look,
there's your fucking retarded.

2733
01:51:51,641 --> 01:51:53,860
It doesn't matter what ethnicity they 
are from anybody who does.

2734
01:51:53,861 --> 01:51:55,810
That's an idiot.
And like I said before,

2735
01:51:55,811 --> 01:51:57,070
why are they idiots?
Why didn't?

2736
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:58,960
Because they were raised by idiots for 
sure.

2737
01:51:59,230 --> 01:52:04,230
They're not doing that because that's 
human nature to do it because they're 

2738
01:52:04,230 --> 01:52:08,011
there.
They're born into a fucked up situation 

2739
01:52:08,011 --> 01:52:08,011
with a ton of struggle by a bunch of 
people that can't cope and doesn't,

2740
01:52:08,011 --> 01:52:08,740
don't balance things.
Right.

2741
01:52:08,741 --> 01:52:11,320
And you know,
born into poverty.

2742
01:52:11,321 --> 01:52:12,790
Alot of them born into,
you know,

2743
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:15,280
immigration situations.
There's a lot of fucking stripe.

2744
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:17,260
You're uh,
you're raising kids right now.

2745
01:52:17,261 --> 01:52:22,261
Uh,
do you feel like raising kids is almost 

2746
01:52:22,261 --> 01:52:25,000
like raising a wild animal almost where 
you have to like teach them,

2747
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:28,390
you have to almost house trained them 
and all that.

2748
01:52:28,391 --> 01:52:31,780
So I know you don't want to talk about 
your children's not specific like that.

2749
01:52:31,781 --> 01:52:34,030
It's much more different.
It's like an alien.

2750
01:52:34,031 --> 01:52:35,860
So like something that doesn't even know
this world,

2751
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,000
you know,
wild animal has their own instincts and 

2752
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:41,000
you have to kind of tone them down.
And I've had wild cats before.

2753
01:52:41,190 --> 01:52:46,190
I would feral cats that were raised 
outside or they were born outside and 

2754
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:46,190
they're wild man,
feral

2755
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:46,850
cats.
Even when you get.

2756
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:49,700
I got mine when he was a kitten,
he was only like two months old.

2757
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:51,440
He was maybe three months old at the 
most,

2758
01:52:51,441 --> 01:52:56,441
but he was wild as fuck.
I mean wild like hissing at you and 

2759
01:52:56,441 --> 01:52:58,780
fucking leaping,
clawing the walls and Mon.

2760
01:52:58,790 --> 01:53:01,310
I first got them.
I'm a friend of mine that I went to high

2761
01:53:01,311 --> 01:53:04,310
school with.
She had a bunch of them in her apartment

2762
01:53:04,311 --> 01:53:09,311
was like,
there was a parking lot area and this 

2763
01:53:09,311 --> 01:53:09,311
female federal Canada at a bunch of 
kittens.

2764
01:53:09,311 --> 01:53:13,190
So she decIded she was gonna catch the 
kittens and give them two houses and she

2765
01:53:13,191 --> 01:53:15,380
gave one of them to me and so I took 
this fucking cat.

2766
01:53:15,381 --> 01:53:20,381
This cat was crazy dude.
I mean I'd never seen anything like it 

2767
01:53:20,381 --> 01:53:21,860
ever in my life,
but I had a couple of days off work so I

2768
01:53:21,861 --> 01:53:23,990
decided I'm going to have to get this 
cat delight me.

2769
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:25,520
I've got this cat is going to live in my
house.

2770
01:53:25,521 --> 01:53:27,500
I'm gonna have to get this cat to be 
chill with me.

2771
01:53:27,710 --> 01:53:32,710
So I put one of my bedrooms.
I put a bed in it that I don't normally 

2772
01:53:32,710 --> 01:53:36,620
sleep in and I put some cat food in 
there and some water and I just slept in

2773
01:53:36,621 --> 01:53:41,621
there,
read books for two days and wrote 

2774
01:53:41,621 --> 01:53:41,621
material and hung out with this little 
cat until he became my friend,

2775
01:53:41,870 --> 01:53:43,160
but dude,
it was crazy.

2776
01:53:43,161 --> 01:53:48,161
I'd pick him up.
He would start purring and then I would 

2777
01:53:48,161 --> 01:53:48,620
put them down as soon as I put them 
down,

2778
01:53:49,810 --> 01:53:53,210
go fucking crazy and run away from me 
and fucking tried to climb up the walls.

2779
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:58,360
It was like when I would pick them up,
the warmth and the comfort in the fact 

2780
01:53:58,360 --> 01:53:58,360
that I was giving him affection,
a keanu he could relax,

2781
01:53:58,360 --> 01:53:59,940
that I was going to do good things,
but as soon as I put them down,

2782
01:53:59,941 --> 01:54:04,941
it's was like immediate terror,
so it's nothing or nothing like raising 

2783
01:54:04,941 --> 01:54:04,941
a wild animal.

2784
01:54:04,941 --> 01:54:09,400
It'S like raising something that doesn't
exist and all of a sudden it gets 

2785
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:10,940
brought forth into this dimension with a
completely clean slate.

2786
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:13,940
They have no knowledge of what's going 
on.

2787
01:54:13,970 --> 01:54:18,970
They have certain tendencies,
tendencies towards being needy or 

2788
01:54:18,970 --> 01:54:21,020
aggressive or tendencies towards being 
relaxed and they,

2789
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:24,470
their personality is definitely very and
whether or not that's genetic,

2790
01:54:24,471 --> 01:54:26,960
whether or not that's just when they 
were born,

2791
01:54:26,961 --> 01:54:28,580
you know,
what was going on,

2792
01:54:28,581 --> 01:54:29,960
you know,
with my wife's body,

2793
01:54:29,961 --> 01:54:34,961
what was going on with her diet,
but what's going on with their genetics 

2794
01:54:34,961 --> 01:54:34,961
was going on with,
you know,

2795
01:54:34,961 --> 01:54:38,950
the fucking solar system,
who the fuck knows what influences 

2796
01:54:38,950 --> 01:54:38,950
behavior,
whether astrology is really not.

2797
01:54:38,990 --> 01:54:43,990
And then from there you just get this 
blank slate and you got to raise this 

2798
01:54:43,990 --> 01:54:44,240
blank slate.
But it's really,

2799
01:54:44,610 --> 01:54:46,200
it doesn't seem like the community,
like,

2800
01:54:46,370 --> 01:54:51,370
you know,
like people think of it as like this 

2801
01:54:51,370 --> 01:54:51,370
burden,
like,

2802
01:54:51,370 --> 01:54:51,370
oh gotta raise this kid.

2803
01:54:51,370 --> 01:54:52,190
I used to always think that's probably 
what it was like that you have kids.

2804
01:54:52,191 --> 01:54:54,320
Like god becomes a burden.
Gotta take care of the kids,

2805
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:58,730
but it doesn't seem like that to me.
To me it seems it's fucking awesome.

2806
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:01,700
It's like you're raising this new little
loving creature,

2807
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:02,850
you know,
this little,

2808
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:07,860
little,
little awesome person that you love so 

2809
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:07,860
much,
man.

2810
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:08,270
Like you want to do it like you want to 
be with them.

2811
01:55:08,271 --> 01:55:09,860
You never.
It doesn't feel like a burden to me,

2812
01:55:09,861 --> 01:55:11,450
man.
It feels like a lot of fun.

2813
01:55:11,451 --> 01:55:13,300
I mean sometimes it requires a lot of 
attention.

2814
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:15,890
It's tough to get things done,
but it's fun.

2815
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:17,350
But it was also.
I'm having a I,

2816
01:55:17,351 --> 01:55:19,010
you know,
I had a baby when I was 40.

2817
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:21,140
I didn't have a baby when I was 20 and 
broken,

2818
01:55:21,141 --> 01:55:24,200
fucked up and confused and trying to 
make my way in the world.

2819
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,570
I had a baby when I was already relaxed,
you know,

2820
01:55:26,571 --> 01:55:31,571
I had a baby when are already had like a
good healthy view of the world.

2821
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:32,240
You know?

2822
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:36,680
I just recently got baby fever.
I think it's the second one that got me.

2823
01:55:36,681 --> 01:55:37,610
I'm just like,
you know what?

2824
01:55:37,611 --> 01:55:42,611
I'm done.
I don't need to be hanging out at a 

2825
01:55:42,611 --> 01:55:44,201
comedy club at two in the morning.
I don't need to go to a bar and rave 

2826
01:55:44,201 --> 01:55:44,370
with my glow sticks when you need to do 
it,

2827
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:45,180
you know,
I just,

2828
01:55:45,181 --> 01:55:48,420
I feel like I just want to sit at home 
and be happy.

2829
01:55:48,421 --> 01:55:48,770
And

2830
01:55:48,850 --> 01:55:50,770
will you love pets?
You love pets man.

2831
01:55:50,771 --> 01:55:52,720
If you love cats and dogs,
I know you do.

2832
01:55:53,110 --> 01:55:58,110
You would love a human being.
I think that would make great pets will 

2833
01:55:58,220 --> 01:56:02,260
make the world would be so muCh better 
if more cool people had kids,

2834
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,120
you know,
we will.

2835
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:05,320
We would figure out a way to,
you know,

2836
01:56:05,380 --> 01:56:10,380
to raise human beings and have like 
generations that were really nice and 

2837
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:13,861
friendly to each other.
The problem was just too much 

2838
01:56:13,861 --> 01:56:16,260
inequality,
too much inequality in the way children 

2839
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:16,260
are raised as well.
Too much,

2840
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:19,680
too many situations where people are 
like looking at people that have things 

2841
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:19,680
on tv and go,
why not me?

2842
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:21,100
Or they'd have things in the world that 
they don't have and why not me?

2843
01:56:21,101 --> 01:56:23,970
What the fuck?
And this too much anger and you know,

2844
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:28,980
I mean,
and that makes her competition in 

2845
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:28,980
certain in some ways.
You know,

2846
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:31,860
you See things that other people have 
you wish and wish you had and it forces 

2847
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:35,220
you to work harder,
but it's also a developed a lot of 

2848
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:35,220
stress.
There's a lot of.

2849
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:36,090
Yeah,
every time I think about it then I think

2850
01:56:36,091 --> 01:56:37,230
about like,
oh wait,

2851
01:56:37,231 --> 01:56:39,410
when she's like,
fucking 14,

2852
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:41,380
12,
11,

2853
01:56:41,890 --> 01:56:43,300
do that.
We know how creepy they are.

2854
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:49,190
Think about some guys that we've,
we've come across in our lives and how 

2855
01:56:49,190 --> 01:56:50,290
fucking nutty there are.
Especially should fear.

2856
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:54,460
No really hate women.
You know,

2857
01:56:54,461 --> 01:56:56,530
I,
I've known dudes that really have issues

2858
01:56:56,531 --> 01:57:01,531
with women and when women would turn 
them down they would yell at them and 

2859
01:57:01,531 --> 01:57:04,021
shit like that.
And it's really embarrassing and creepy 

2860
01:57:04,021 --> 01:57:04,021
to be around.
And you know,

2861
01:57:04,021 --> 01:57:04,021
you can think,
man,

2862
01:57:04,021 --> 01:57:04,310
that could be your daughter.
That could be sam trip,

2863
01:57:04,311 --> 01:57:09,311
lee's daughter.
And some guy's yelling at her calling 

2864
01:57:09,311 --> 01:57:09,311
her a fucking cunt lesbian,
you know,

2865
01:57:09,311 --> 01:57:10,780
because she doesn't want his drink.
No thank you.

2866
01:57:10,781 --> 01:57:11,800
Yeah,
you fucking cunt.

2867
01:57:11,801 --> 01:57:14,440
Lesbian dude.
How many of those guys are out there?

2868
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:19,660
You know what's worse is walking through
vegas like saturday night and just 

2869
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:24,251
seeing like at hard rock and seeing like
fucking like just two girls walking 

2870
01:57:24,251 --> 01:57:28,490
through this maze of fucking drunk 
douchebags vegas guys.

2871
01:57:28,670 --> 01:57:32,230
And it is sad.
They're like attacked lesbian.

2872
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:32,890
Yeah.

2873
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:35,690
Girls go to lesbian,
asm,

2874
01:57:35,691 --> 01:57:39,440
I mean just total speculation.
But I've met girls that go both ways and

2875
01:57:39,441 --> 01:57:41,440
sometimes there'll be like lesbians for 
like a year.

2876
01:57:41,450 --> 01:57:44,660
So it's just,
they get old deed on douche bags.

2877
01:57:45,170 --> 01:57:46,940
They just want some kindness in their 
life.

2878
01:57:46,941 --> 01:57:48,110
And so they just said,
let's just,

2879
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:50,270
I'll be your girlfriend for you.
I'll be flowery.

2880
01:57:51,630 --> 01:57:54,080
Eddie's a eddie dated a chick that uh,
she,

2881
01:57:54,170 --> 01:57:56,840
she moved somewhere and became a 
lesbian.

2882
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:58,070
Yeah.
Like,

2883
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:03,100
you know,
he was dating her and they broke up and 

2884
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:05,111
she did it,
a bunch of different dudes and this and 

2885
01:58:05,111 --> 01:58:06,671
that and blah blah blah.
And then she just decided to take some 

2886
01:58:06,671 --> 01:58:06,671
time off from dick

2887
01:58:06,671 --> 01:58:10,610
fucking scissor for a bit dated.
I hooked up with this chick and right 

2888
01:58:10,610 --> 01:58:12,540
before we had sex for the fIrst time,
she's like,

2889
01:58:12,541 --> 01:58:17,541
I just need to let you know that for the
last five years I've been living as a 

2890
01:58:17,541 --> 01:58:17,541
lesbian.
Wow.

2891
01:58:17,541 --> 01:58:17,670
I'm like,
oh man.

2892
01:58:17,671 --> 01:58:22,590
Like I need this kind of pressure.
When I'm like jackie robinson,

2893
01:58:22,591 --> 01:58:23,250
man,
I like,

2894
01:58:23,251 --> 01:58:25,650
I get one shot and if I don't take care 
of business,

2895
01:58:25,651 --> 01:58:27,710
nobody gets his dick.
I'm sure.

2896
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:29,160
Was a good shoT.
So it was awesome,

2897
01:58:29,161 --> 01:58:29,890
wasn't it?
Oh,

2898
01:58:30,090 --> 01:58:35,090
fucking loved it.
she wanted me to crying and she really 

2899
01:58:35,090 --> 01:58:35,090
wants you to choke her.
Yeah,

2900
01:58:35,090 --> 01:58:35,220
I don't like that shit.

2901
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:38,120
She wanted you to choke her and she was 
a lesbian.

2902
01:58:38,121 --> 01:58:40,040
She wanted the full mail experience,
bro.

2903
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,350
You aren't bringing heat.
She's crazy.

2904
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:43,990
I crazy.
It was a good though.

2905
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:45,320
Crazy good.
Yeah.

2906
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:48,250
I like crazy chicks.
Did I ever tell you about like women who

2907
01:58:48,251 --> 01:58:49,570
were a little bit cross?
I too.

2908
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:54,580
I,
I don't know why I had a girl that a 

2909
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:55,870
little bit and that's another,
another connection.

2910
01:58:55,871 --> 01:58:57,340
Like I talked about the foot fetish 
thing.

2911
01:58:57,580 --> 01:59:00,940
I had a girl that I dated when I was 22 
and 21 actually,

2912
01:59:00,941 --> 01:59:05,941
and she was older than me.
She was really kind of sexy and she had 

2913
01:59:05,941 --> 01:59:08,461
a wonky eye and that wonky I've like had
like a thing about wonky eyes and so it 

2914
01:59:08,461 --> 01:59:12,220
was just a little one.
She's going to try harder.

2915
01:59:12,221 --> 01:59:13,180
Brian,
you don't understand.

2916
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:18,480
She's aware that wonky eye and she's 
just going to give a little bit more 

2917
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:21,630
zest into the kiss.
I just met this asian chick awhile ago 

2918
01:59:21,630 --> 01:59:23,200
and she had the greatest body and a 
little bit cross.

2919
01:59:23,201 --> 01:59:24,810
I might.
it's really hot.

2920
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:25,560
Yeah,

2921
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:26,750
I went.
I agree.

2922
01:59:26,810 --> 01:59:31,810
I once dated this girl,
I don't know if I'd said this or not on 

2923
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:34,031
the podcast,
but I once dated this girl that every 

2924
01:59:34,031 --> 01:59:35,921
time she would have an orgasm she would 
have like a full on seizure and fly off 

2925
01:59:35,921 --> 01:59:38,600
and hit bookshelves and knocked 
bookshelves down and stuff like that and

2926
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:43,900
ever since then I've been hoping that I 
get to find another girl like that 

2927
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:45,890
because you don't understand how fucking
amazing night is like you were about to.

2928
01:59:45,891 --> 01:59:50,891
You're having sex,
you're both to come and then she comes 

2929
01:59:50,891 --> 01:59:53,200
and she's just flyIng like a flopping 
fish all over the place and it's just 

2930
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:53,200
like,
well,

2931
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:57,620
should just putting on a show.
No hurt herself doing it.

2932
01:59:57,860 --> 02:00:00,140
Like I fucked her.
Make sure she's not just retarded.

2933
02:00:00,170 --> 02:00:00,490
No,
no,

2934
02:00:00,491 --> 02:00:02,210
no.
To think this is a girl.

2935
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:05,480
I mean she loves.
She loves sex so much.

2936
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:10,480
We did this move like we,
it was when we used to work at this 

2937
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:10,520
mexican place and we did this move 
called the don pablo.

2938
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:14,030
That's the place we used to work at don 
pablos and it was where we did buck to,

2939
02:00:14,031 --> 02:00:19,031
but you know,
take my dick and rapid between my legs 

2940
02:00:19,031 --> 02:00:20,000
and then pull,
hold her legs.

2941
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:22,220
I saw that in a peter north video.
Is that a real video?

2942
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:23,520
I don't even know if that was a real 
meal,

2943
02:00:23,521 --> 02:00:26,060
but we used to call it the dom pop girls
sucking it that way.

2944
02:00:26,061 --> 02:00:27,950
That's what it was at it backwards.
So yeah,

2945
02:00:27,951 --> 02:00:30,140
like we're on top and I'm holding her 
legs,

2946
02:00:30,141 --> 02:00:35,141
pushing the deq in while my dick's,
between my legs going through her from 

2947
02:00:35,141 --> 02:00:35,510
behind.
How dogs fuck is it

2948
02:00:37,910 --> 02:00:42,910
backwards?
Dogs fucked doggystyle they get caught 

2949
02:00:42,910 --> 02:00:44,800
when they get stuck and they try to step
off.

2950
02:00:45,050 --> 02:00:50,050
You know what it's like.
It's like when you're Inside of dudes 

2951
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:51,400
guard and he goes for a leg lock and 
then you have to step over backwards and

2952
02:00:51,401 --> 02:00:52,510
then you get into donkey guard.

2953
02:00:55,450 --> 02:00:56,170
Yeah.
But so anyways,

2954
02:00:56,171 --> 02:00:57,760
It was weird because it was just a 
freak.

2955
02:00:57,810 --> 02:01:02,810
She saw she would fucking come and like 
the that it would take a minute maybe of

2956
02:01:02,831 --> 02:01:04,590
her just sitting there going like,
like screens.

2957
02:01:04,830 --> 02:01:05,340
No,

2958
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:11,300
while she's shaking like consultants get
annoying after a while when I was doing 

2959
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:12,140
it,
but now it kind of like a fed.

2960
02:01:12,141 --> 02:01:13,860
It's like I want it,
I want to do that again.

2961
02:01:14,180 --> 02:01:16,170
After a while we like,
will you just shut the fuck up?

2962
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:18,630
I just got like water while she was 
doing.

2963
02:01:18,631 --> 02:01:20,390
I just like walk up and make sure she 
didn't hit her.

2964
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:22,850
I used to date a mexican girl.
Ucl.

2965
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:25,320
Racial slurs at me in bed for real.
Yeah,

2966
02:01:25,330 --> 02:01:26,950
it was really hot.
Wow.

2967
02:01:27,010 --> 02:01:29,530
I don't know why.
I just really like would be kind of high

2968
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:30,850
racial slurs.
Like what would she say?

2969
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:34,280
Everything.
Like what you might bitch motherfucker.

2970
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,690
She dropped the inbox.
I'm really well.

2971
02:01:37,691 --> 02:01:41,650
How would she use it?
Say what she's saying.

2972
02:01:41,660 --> 02:01:43,420
What the fuck?
This is the podcast one.

2973
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:45,200
There's thousands listening to this 
right now.

2974
02:01:45,201 --> 02:01:47,030
Tell us what the fuck she would say to 
just be like,

2975
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:49,560

Fuck me nigger.

2976
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:53,780
Man.
It's not you saying it.

2977
02:01:53,781 --> 02:01:55,070
You know,
but we all know.

2978
02:01:55,490 --> 02:01:57,980
We all know what triply this is sad to 
me.

2979
02:01:58,070 --> 02:02:00,500
Why?
Because you're supposed to say It man.

2980
02:02:00,501 --> 02:02:03,990
But tell me what this bitch was saying.
She gonna drop bombs.

2981
02:02:04,030 --> 02:02:05,240
Dude.
That's great.

2982
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:06,770
Do you get to make your dick look a 
little harder?

2983
02:02:06,990 --> 02:02:08,910
Cruisy pitch?
Yeah.

2984
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:10,700
I liked it.
Fucking crazy pitch.

2985
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:12,770
I like it when girls talk.
I did.

2986
02:02:12,810 --> 02:02:15,320
I love.
I want to get offended when I have like,

2987
02:02:15,321 --> 02:02:17,660
I want her to say offensive shit.
Wow.

2988
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:19,850
I like that.
Hate that quiet shit where there's.

2989
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:22,490
But see I don't like saying shit unless 
they are.

2990
02:02:22,610 --> 02:02:24,470
So if they're not then I don't say 
anything.

2991
02:02:24,471 --> 02:02:27,470
I tried to make no noise at all,
but that's awful.

2992
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:31,130
No noise at all.
I'm just like,

2993
02:02:37,990 --> 02:02:39,470
oh,
you know,

2994
02:02:39,471 --> 02:02:42,590
I'm not doing anything like that.
That sounds like nelson reilly.

2995
02:02:42,820 --> 02:02:47,140
Oh,
Charles Nelson reilly is exodus.

2996
02:02:47,770 --> 02:02:49,640
terrific.
This was awesome.

2997
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:53,810
Yeah.
You don't make noise,

2998
02:02:53,811 --> 02:02:54,380
man.
No,

2999
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:57,860
I try not to get caught out on it.
Sometimes you get called out on it.

3000
02:02:57,861 --> 02:02:58,790
Yeah.
I get called out on.

3001
02:02:59,290 --> 02:03:04,290
It was so quiet and I'm like quiet girl 
who would just explode down there?

3002
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:09,130
Oh,
me too.

3003
02:03:09,910 --> 02:03:11,000
Oh yeah.
Love question.

3004
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:15,500
You could always tell when she warm.
It's so great.

3005
02:03:15,501 --> 02:03:16,880
you oversee it?
Spray out?

3006
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:19,160
No,
I never really wanted to see it.

3007
02:03:19,161 --> 02:03:24,161
I just felt it felt it one time.
God let us hold on to a girl that did 

3008
02:03:26,151 --> 02:03:26,510
that.
He goes,

3009
02:03:26,511 --> 02:03:31,511
but it was inconsistent.
One day be lIke fucking mint juleps the 

3010
02:03:31,511 --> 02:03:31,511
next day.
Be like gatorade.

3011
02:03:31,511 --> 02:03:33,590
I don't know what to fucking expect.
It was still confusing.

3012
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:39,070
It always collected my belly button and 
then I used to just lay there after sex 

3013
02:03:39,070 --> 02:03:39,550
and like flick my finger in my belly 
button.

3014
02:03:40,290 --> 02:03:41,870
Gross for me.
The fuck out.

3015
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:47,040
Weird cock sucker.
I want some chicken in the back of a 

3016
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:51,371
phantom.
You boldly chicken the back of a car 

3017
02:03:51,371 --> 02:03:53,570
like a rolls royce.
Oh shit.

3018
02:03:53,571 --> 02:03:54,290
Yeah,
dude,

3019
02:03:54,490 --> 02:03:57,200
I did this gig in this.
I was working with this guy.

3020
02:03:57,230 --> 02:03:58,760
Bang some rich guy's wife.
No,

3021
02:03:58,770 --> 02:04:00,720
I just.
This chick was running,

3022
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:05,280
running with us and she just,
I'm sitting in the back of car.

3023
02:04:05,281 --> 02:04:10,281
She just all over me and then like 
everyone leaves car just hanging out and

3024
02:04:10,431 --> 02:04:15,431
I just start nailing her in the back and
I'm just instead of answering next time,

3025
02:04:22,551 --> 02:04:25,430
just go like this and they continue to 
store.

3026
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:27,410
Just ignoring what the fuck you're 
saying.

3027
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:33,110
by the way,
this podcast is sponsored by fleshlight?

3028
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:34,550
Yeah,
by the end.

3029
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:36,980
We have to say that at the end,
how much is a phantom cost?

3030
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,220
Rose was a half a

3031
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:39,510
million bucks or something.
Dude.

3032
02:04:39,511 --> 02:04:44,511
It was real deal shit.
That's like one of those ultimate 

3033
02:04:44,511 --> 02:04:47,421
philosophy things like I'm sure it's 
cool to like drive around in must feel 

3034
02:04:47,421 --> 02:04:48,330
like really sturdy.
I mean they're like really,

3035
02:04:48,331 --> 02:04:50,940
really well made,
but that'S just like an ultimate.

3036
02:04:50,941 --> 02:04:54,150
Like flossIng moves those.
That's what those cars like,

3037
02:04:54,290 --> 02:04:56,850
you could run those into a building and 
you won't get hurt.

3038
02:04:56,851 --> 02:04:58,340
They're built to like,
yeah,

3039
02:04:58,350 --> 02:05:03,350
they're awesomely built,
but it's like also like the people that 

3040
02:05:03,350 --> 02:05:03,510
want them.
Like that's an extreme statement,

3041
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:06,590
you know what I'm saying?
I think this guy was a limo driver so he

3042
02:05:06,780 --> 02:05:08,090
was one of the cars that.
Oh,

3043
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:09,180
okay,
okay,

3044
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:11,730
well and still you want to show people 
was the shit.

3045
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:16,740
Act forward.
See what I get when I go out for my 

3046
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:16,740
limo.
And it was fun.

3047
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:18,450
Just spray and he's like,
please,

3048
02:05:18,451 --> 02:05:19,170
please,
please.

3049
02:05:19,171 --> 02:05:22,470
And then they had a mercedes.
They're grower to the mercedes.

3050
02:05:22,471 --> 02:05:25,980
So we went over to the mercedes and 
finish what we were doing because she is

3051
02:05:25,981 --> 02:05:28,200
splattering all over your seats.
Oh yeah.

3052
02:05:28,201 --> 02:05:31,080
He didn't want us to ruin his.
oh wow.

3053
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:32,490
That's great.
She a sprayer.

3054
02:05:32,670 --> 02:05:34,080
Yeah.
Oh my god.

3055
02:05:34,081 --> 02:05:39,081
Over the imagine if the back of his 
fucking beautiful car to smell like 

3056
02:05:39,081 --> 02:05:40,950
pussy,
just dirty,

3057
02:05:40,951 --> 02:05:42,600
stinky pussy everywhere.

3058
02:05:43,570 --> 02:05:45,600
I missed it.
She loved it and asked him.

3059
02:05:45,710 --> 02:05:46,360
Oh,
ditching.

3060
02:05:46,450 --> 02:05:51,450
Yeah.
You ever meet the chicks who love it in 

3061
02:05:51,450 --> 02:05:53,101
the ass?
They're pretending to love it in the 

3062
02:05:53,101 --> 02:05:55,460
ass.
Never met somebody that loved girls that

3063
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:57,200
say they love it.
They love it in there.

3064
02:05:57,660 --> 02:05:59,530
I've heard girls yell it out at a comedy
club.

3065
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:04,560
Some people,
it just depends how like some people 

3066
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,050
have whatever that that sensitive ass 
hole where it feels like a a.

3067
02:06:06,350 --> 02:06:11,350
I can have orgasms from it.
That's how much how sensItive it is and 

3068
02:06:11,350 --> 02:06:14,581
other girls don't have that vein or 
whatever that goes through the side of 

3069
02:06:14,581 --> 02:06:14,581
it.
That's a doctor talking right now.

3070
02:06:14,581 --> 02:06:16,370
Just dr red,
that's ghetto daca.

3071
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:20,090
Yeah,
you cut that vein is all about sex.

3072
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:20,670
You get that?

3073
02:06:21,410 --> 02:06:24,290
Dalai lama's antibodies sucks.
So he's anti gay sex.

3074
02:06:24,291 --> 02:06:27,320
I guess he's not even.
He's anti blowjob too,

3075
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:32,350
so he is the anti gay sex.
Most of the sexual only be used for 

3076
02:06:32,350 --> 02:06:33,370
procreation.
Oral and anal is sexual

3077
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:35,280
indiscretion.
I mean most of the year,

3078
02:06:35,281 --> 02:06:37,390
like in christianity,
all the taboo.

3079
02:06:37,391 --> 02:06:40,460
Sex is our.
Don't create more christians,

3080
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:41,160
but who support?
Supportive.

3081
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:46,170
Why more gay people in the dalai lama,
the dalai lama is essentially saying 

3082
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:47,440
that what they're doIng is they're doing
is unnatural and is a.

3083
02:06:47,441 --> 02:06:52,441
Is not what you should be pursuing.
You should only be pursuing pursuing 

3084
02:06:52,441 --> 02:06:52,570
sex.
that creates babies.

3085
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:54,340
That's literally what he's saying.
That's.

3086
02:06:54,610 --> 02:06:56,940
He probably doesn't get laid that much 
at all.

3087
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:59,950
How about ever me?
Maybe he gets laid occasionally.

3088
02:06:59,951 --> 02:07:00,910
I don't know.
We don't know.

3089
02:07:00,911 --> 02:07:02,880
Maybe.
fuck Sharon Stone and flashlights.

3090
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:06,370
Fleshlight fleshlight.
Send them an avatar.

3091
02:07:06,371 --> 02:07:11,371
One.
We need to figure out a way to get 

3092
02:07:11,371 --> 02:07:11,371
avatar on board with this.

3093
02:07:11,371 --> 02:07:11,371
By the way.
They have clear ones.

3094
02:07:11,371 --> 02:07:12,120
They have clear ones.
I was like,

3095
02:07:12,121 --> 02:07:17,121
oh man.
That's like fucking wonder woman when 

3096
02:07:17,121 --> 02:07:17,121
she's in the.
Oh yeah,

3097
02:07:17,121 --> 02:07:19,110
yeah,
totally miserable jet.

3098
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:23,850
Just look down and you see lIttle wonder
woman interject.

3099
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:26,730
I like the idea of a clear one though,
man,

3100
02:07:26,740 --> 02:07:31,740
because there's something serial killer 
about the whole rubber pussy that's the 

3101
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:31,740
same car as an actual pussy.

3102
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:35,890
Have you ever seen those dolls?
They're like life real dolls.

3103
02:07:35,891 --> 02:07:36,190
Yeah.

3104
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:38,380
I thought about getting a gay one for 
jujitsu.

3105
02:07:38,650 --> 02:07:43,650
I was already.
That'd be the perfect thing to practice 

3106
02:07:43,650 --> 02:07:43,650
on because it's just like a real dude 
because I have a.

3107
02:07:43,650 --> 02:07:45,350
But then I thought,
how do you explain that away?

3108
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:49,510
I got fake jujitsu dummies in my garage 
that I practice on,

3109
02:07:49,511 --> 02:07:51,910
like if I can't get to class and I got 
some shit I got to work on,

3110
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:57,060
I'll work out on the dummy,
go over moves on a dummy because it's 

3111
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:57,460
like it's above a dump.
They make them for gracie jujitsu,

3112
02:07:58,090 --> 02:08:00,400
but it's not as accurate as like a real 
doll.

3113
02:08:00,430 --> 02:08:02,180
I bought a real dog would work better,
but you know what,

3114
02:08:02,181 --> 02:08:05,050
you should just get you have cast just 
to get it to put in your closet and look

3115
02:08:05,051 --> 02:08:07,930
at it all.
I would want to dude.

3116
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:09,340
Oh,
skin tone.

3117
02:08:09,370 --> 02:08:09,610
No,
no,

3118
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:09,840
no,
no.

3119
02:08:09,910 --> 02:08:10,240
Yeah,
that's.

3120
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:15,340
I think the sign was tough.
I heard drew carey at eight real dose.

3121
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:19,300
Really a shoot.
Carrie's got so much money,

3122
02:08:19,301 --> 02:08:19,960
man.
Dude,

3123
02:08:19,961 --> 02:08:22,420
how great is that gig?
He's such a nice guy too,

3124
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:23,020
man.
True.

3125
02:08:23,021 --> 02:08:25,360
Karen is like one of the nicest guys I 
think I've ever run across.

3126
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:28,420
Always friendly,
always a big smile on his face.

3127
02:08:28,630 --> 02:08:30,460
I've never even heard of it being a 
dick,

3128
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:33,100
you know,
just always like a fun guy to be around.

3129
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:35,590
Loves comedy,
gives advice to comics.

3130
02:08:35,710 --> 02:08:38,560
He was given advice to some fucking new 
comic at the improv the other day,

3131
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:40,390
not the other day.
It was like maybe a couple months ago,

3132
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:45,600
but drew was there and there was some 
new comic there and we were all talking 

3133
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:49,591
and the new comic asks a question and 
drew carey just gave them all sorts of 

3134
02:08:49,591 --> 02:08:49,780
information.
Just write 30 jokes a day.

3135
02:08:49,780 --> 02:08:51,370
Just sit down and force yourself to 
write.

3136
02:08:51,371 --> 02:08:53,830
Get up every time you can record your 
act.

3137
02:08:53,831 --> 02:08:56,790
he was like giving them all this great 
fucking advice jokes.

3138
02:08:57,190 --> 02:08:58,420
It's like if you do that,
if you.

3139
02:08:58,430 --> 02:09:00,070
If you do that,
if you really dedicate yourself,

3140
02:09:00,071 --> 02:09:02,020
you're going to have some gems.
You're gonna come up with some gems.

3141
02:09:02,021 --> 02:09:03,750
You force yourself to write something,
you know,

3142
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:05,290
just sit down and write a bunch of shit 
like that.

3143
02:09:05,291 --> 02:09:07,150
He's so right.
He's fucking great advice,

3144
02:09:07,151 --> 02:09:11,110
but the fact that he took the time to do
that to some kids from Ohio,

3145
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:15,190
Ohio guy,
that's where columbus,

3146
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:20,740
Ohio does have a lot of nice people.
There are a lot of canadians in a way,

3147
02:09:20,970 --> 02:09:22,780
a little less,
little less cool.

3148
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:27,330
Chicks are great.
I like Ohio tick's mid west.

3149
02:09:27,530 --> 02:09:29,710
They've always been very nice to from 
stock.

3150
02:09:29,860 --> 02:09:31,420
I do.
I like thick chicks.

3151
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:34,390
I like amazon's.
That's why I loved Australia.

3152
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,420
Just amazon chicks,
strong women.

3153
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:38,650
I saw.
I read that on your twitter,

3154
02:09:38,651 --> 02:09:41,620
right?
They're all amazons and pregnant.

3155
02:09:42,190 --> 02:09:47,190
Those are my two favorite things.
Australia is a pretty awesome fucking 

3156
02:09:47,190 --> 02:09:47,920
country man.
There's no religious guilt out there.

3157
02:09:47,921 --> 02:09:48,810
You can do.
I was doing.

3158
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:52,410
Jesus jokes are fucking great man.
They're friendly as shit too.

3159
02:09:52,530 --> 02:09:55,960
I got to talk slow though to like you 
have a really thick accent.

3160
02:09:57,340 --> 02:09:59,860
I could do their accent is pretty bad 
ass.

3161
02:09:59,861 --> 02:10:03,160
Their accent just sounds party because 
like if you had token like that might,

3162
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:05,770
you know like that's not like a guy who 
takes himself too seriously.

3163
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:08,890
That's the guy who's going to throw you 
another beer and then I was in sydney.

3164
02:10:08,891 --> 02:10:10,630
It's pretty expensive over there,
man.

3165
02:10:10,650 --> 02:10:12,340
A little bit.
Cindy's the shit though.

3166
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:14,170
Todd's fucking.
They're removed from everybody,

3167
02:10:14,171 --> 02:10:14,350
man.

3168
02:10:14,350 --> 02:10:19,350
it's hard to get shit over there.
Our driver was telling us how much cars 

3169
02:10:19,350 --> 02:10:19,350
are there.
They're like real expensive because they

3170
02:10:19,350 --> 02:10:22,300
got to ship them from other places they 
have like their own australian cars.

3171
02:10:22,301 --> 02:10:27,301
You don't recognize like,
what the fuck is that some weird alien 

3172
02:10:27,301 --> 02:10:27,301
car and shit.
You know,

3173
02:10:27,301 --> 02:10:28,990
they're like completely removed from the
rest of the world.

3174
02:10:29,410 --> 02:10:32,230
They're fucking far away.
And the crazy thing is that was a prison

3175
02:10:32,231 --> 02:10:35,870
colony for england in england is fucking
boring as shit.

3176
02:10:35,990 --> 02:10:40,990
Rainy weather all fucked up.
Australia is beautiful and that's a 

3177
02:10:40,990 --> 02:10:42,230
prison colony and there.
So.

3178
02:10:42,231 --> 02:10:44,030
Cool.
How the fuck did that happen?

3179
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:46,130
I don't know man.
By the best time.

3180
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:48,530
How long were you there for?
Two and a half weeks.

3181
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:50,330
Yeah,
Australia is the shit,

3182
02:10:50,331 --> 02:10:51,410
man.
Had a good.

3183

Fear and joey coco diaz.
Oh,

3217
02:12:20,511 --> 02:12:21,380
snap.
Oh,

3218
02:12:21,381 --> 02:12:23,180
snap.
Full death squat appearance.

3219
02:12:23,540 --> 02:12:24,320
Brian's gonna.
Be there.

3220
02:12:24,330 --> 02:12:27,050
Video taping.
So if you want to kiss brian,

3221
02:12:27,051 --> 02:12:28,370
he's ready.
Yes.

3222
02:12:28,430 --> 02:12:29,120
Ready?
Because people.

3223
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:30,750
Yes.
Because anybody,

3224
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:31,400
boy,
gIrl,

3225
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:32,180
whatever.
No,

3226
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:32,890
no.
Okay.

3227
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:35,600
No flashlights.com.
Go to joe's website.

3228
02:12:35,601 --> 02:12:38,810
Click on the link at 15 percent off.
They are awesome.

3229
02:12:38,811 --> 02:12:39,920
And we both love them.
You know,

3230
02:12:39,921 --> 02:12:44,240
we fucked me up and if anyone from 
flashlights listening get us more.

3231
02:12:44,270 --> 02:12:47,180
We need chris crystal.
I emailed him yesterday to tell him that

3232
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:51,260
the flashlight has made it into my act.
Now there's like I have a whole chunk on

3233
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:56,290
the flashlight and how the chunks.
I think that's the best way to do 

3234
02:12:56,541 --> 02:12:57,960
comedy.
It's the,

3235
02:12:58,110 --> 02:13:00,110
you know,
the guy who I really emulated.

3236
02:13:00,111 --> 02:13:01,490
Where I learned that from was richard,
jenny,

3237
02:13:01,910 --> 02:13:04,460
because richard,
jenny would write and he would write the

3238
02:13:04,461 --> 02:13:05,870
shit out of a subject.
Man.

3239
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:08,750
I remember I was always impressed when I
would go to see him that this guy,

3240
02:13:08,940 --> 02:13:11,120
like when a guy has just one thing on a 
subject,

3241
02:13:11,121 --> 02:13:13,160
he brings up a subject,
he has a thing on it,

3242
02:13:13,161 --> 02:13:15,140
and then he moves onto the next subject.
I always feel like,

3243
02:13:15,141 --> 02:13:20,141
well,
you just started toucHing on the 

3244
02:13:20,141 --> 02:13:20,141
subject.
You sure that that's all the angles that

3245
02:13:20,141 --> 02:13:20,150
are in that subject.
I don't,

3246
02:13:20,151 --> 02:13:22,160
I don't feel like I got enough out of 
that experience,

3247
02:13:22,340 --> 02:13:23,660
but when I would go see richard,
jenny,

3248
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:26,720
that guy would like write these big long
word,

3249
02:13:26,721 --> 02:13:28,100
but right when he thought he was done 
with it,

3250
02:13:28,190 --> 02:13:30,790
he would hit you with more shit with it 
and it made it funnier and funnier.

3251
02:13:30,830 --> 02:13:32,010
More ridiculous as it

3252
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:37,010
got along.
So I learned how to do that from him 

3253
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:37,010
too.
Well,

3254
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:39,000
you do chunks to men.
Electronic store guys do chunks,

3255
02:13:39,001 --> 02:13:39,850
right?
Yeah.

3256
02:13:39,890 --> 02:13:42,510
A lot of guys from there,
we have similar styles.

3257
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:44,130
You know,
we'd go loose.

3258
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:47,550
It's not like verbatim same way every 
night because that place is like a chaos

3259
02:13:47,551 --> 02:13:48,130
place.
Yeah.

3260
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:49,860
You can't go up there and do a 
monologue.

3261
02:13:50,250 --> 02:13:52,230
Nobody wants to hear that shit,
you know,

3262
02:13:52,590 --> 02:13:54,450
you're going to have to interact with 
people at some point.

3263
02:13:54,451 --> 02:13:55,530
That's why hey,
showcase.

3264
02:13:55,540 --> 02:13:59,360
And I think showcasing for something Is 
just so not natural,

3265
02:13:59,630 --> 02:14:00,540
like seven minutes.

3266
02:14:00,810 --> 02:14:03,780
Yeah.
And just go up there and a to z and it's

3267
02:14:03,781 --> 02:14:05,010
just like,
that's not what I do.

3268
02:14:05,011 --> 02:14:08,150
It's like I like to be in the moment,
talk about what's going on.

3269
02:14:08,590 --> 02:14:13,590
And it's funny because kennison who was 
one of my favorite comics and I think 

3270
02:14:13,590 --> 02:14:14,650
one of yours as well always had that 
problem,

3271
02:14:14,710 --> 02:14:16,900
you know,
and it's a comedy store guy as well.

3272
02:14:17,110 --> 02:14:20,440
he always had the problem where he said,
it takes me 10 minutes to get cooking.

3273
02:14:20,470 --> 02:14:25,470
I don't want to do like seven minutes.
He got a problem and he didn't want to 

3274
02:14:25,470 --> 02:14:28,411
do.
When the rodney dangerfield specialist 

3275
02:14:28,411 --> 02:14:28,411
on,
he was like,

3276
02:14:28,411 --> 02:14:28,411
wow,
you know,

3277
02:14:28,411 --> 02:14:28,411
10 minutes.
This isn't a lot of time.

3278
02:14:28,411 --> 02:14:29,680
Like he had a concern about that,
you know,

3279
02:14:29,681 --> 02:14:34,681
I think we both have that style that 
comes from the chaos of that fuckIng 

3280
02:14:34,681 --> 02:14:34,681
crazy comedy store

3281
02:14:34,681 --> 02:14:35,530
I did,
man.

3282
02:14:35,830 --> 02:14:38,040
When I walk up on stage,
I just,

3283
02:14:38,050 --> 02:14:40,120
it takes me a little longer than 
everybody else.

3284
02:14:40,300 --> 02:14:42,250
You know,
when there's people who walk up on stage

3285
02:14:42,251 --> 02:14:47,251
and they have a certain look,
you kind of know what they're going to 

3286
02:14:47,251 --> 02:14:48,370
talk about.
So people like our rem board,

3287
02:14:48,430 --> 02:14:53,430
do you know what I'm saying?
Like john gibberella goes up with a hat 

3288
02:14:53,430 --> 02:14:54,460
and he looks like one of the guys from 
south park and talks like this,

3289
02:14:54,461 --> 02:14:59,461
you know,
and it's like he's already kind of like 

3290
02:14:59,461 --> 02:14:59,461
already in.
Do you know what I'm saying?

3291
02:14:59,461 --> 02:15:03,460
It's about ideas goes up.
He's hilarious rail fuck cock suckers.

3292
02:15:03,461 --> 02:15:05,950
What are you looking at?
What's going on here?

3293
02:15:06,280 --> 02:15:08,770
It always takes me like a couple 
minutes.

3294
02:15:08,771 --> 02:15:13,771
I'm fine with that now,
but when I first started I was always 

3295
02:15:13,771 --> 02:15:13,771
get very,
like,

3296
02:15:13,771 --> 02:15:15,080
panicky and then it says that's your set
off in a bad direction,

3297
02:15:15,230 --> 02:15:18,170
but you have this casual like you're,
your act is like,

3298
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:19,170
you know,
I mean,

3299
02:15:19,580 --> 02:15:21,200
sam's one of the funniest guys I've 
worked with,

3300
02:15:21,201 --> 02:15:26,201
he's really hilarious.
If you haven't seen him do stand up 

3301
02:15:26,201 --> 02:15:26,201
before his.
Have you seen him in toronto?

3302
02:15:26,201 --> 02:15:26,201
You know,
if you've seen them in any of the places

3303
02:15:26,201 --> 02:15:26,960
we went to,
you know,

3304
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:28,670
um,
but you know,

3305
02:15:28,730 --> 02:15:31,190
his act is,
you got,

3306
02:15:31,250 --> 02:15:36,250
you don't have any fat in your ax,
you're not trying too hard a bunch of 

3307
02:15:36,250 --> 02:15:36,250
bits.
You're not doing a bunch of shit.

3308
02:15:36,250 --> 02:15:36,260
That's,
you know,

3309
02:15:36,261 --> 02:15:38,360
like in the beginning of your career,
like everybody,

3310
02:15:38,361 --> 02:15:39,520
like I had it.
Everybody has it.

3311
02:15:39,521 --> 02:15:44,521
You have a bunch of bits that you know 
you have in there just because they're 

3312
02:15:44,521 --> 02:15:44,521
in there,
you should have probably cut them out,

3313
02:15:44,521 --> 02:15:45,490
you cut all that shit out,
you know,

3314
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:49,670
your shit is all like what you think is 
funny and how you look at things.

3315
02:15:49,790 --> 02:15:51,900
So when you go up there,
there's no you don't like,

3316
02:15:51,950 --> 02:15:53,870
like try to fake them out right away and
get them,

3317
02:15:53,930 --> 02:15:55,940
get them going.
You just get into your shit.

3318
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,530
You know,
it take your time,

3319
02:15:57,531 --> 02:15:58,880
you know,
it takes a few minutes.

3320
02:15:58,881 --> 02:16:02,480
But once you get that rhythm experience.
I love that though.

3321
02:16:02,481 --> 02:16:07,481
I love watching the guy do that man.
I love watching the guy like set up his 

3322
02:16:07,481 --> 02:16:11,411
shit and get into it slowly.
I really get uncomfortable when I see 

3323
02:16:11,411 --> 02:16:12,050
someone like panicking,
you know,

3324
02:16:12,051 --> 02:16:17,051
when I see someone trying to hard or,
or saying a bunch of shit that's not 

3325
02:16:17,051 --> 02:16:17,051
real,
you know,

3326
02:16:17,051 --> 02:16:18,470
or trying to force things don't eat,
you'll feel that,

3327
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:19,040
you know,
man,

3328
02:16:19,250 --> 02:16:20,670
I'll be honest with you dude.
Like,

3329
02:16:21,130 --> 02:16:22,860
you know,
I love working with you joe,

3330
02:16:22,861 --> 02:16:27,861
because you're literally the probably 
the only person that I can just do any 

3331
02:16:27,871 --> 02:16:32,871
joke I want unleash,
just throw it out there and just go for 

3332
02:16:32,871 --> 02:16:36,910
blood and you just fucking just grabbed 
the wave and just go,

3333
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:37,990
you know,
and follow up.

3334
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:41,140
I mean I've literally gone on roads with
people and had to pull punches,

3335
02:16:41,740 --> 02:16:43,020
you know,
and I understand because

3336
02:16:44,370 --> 02:16:45,590
very similar though,
your,

3337
02:16:45,591 --> 02:16:47,050
your sense of humor,
my sense of humor,

3338
02:16:47,051 --> 02:16:50,280
a very similar so that when you're on 
stage and you're killing,

3339
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:52,290
you know,
I'm laughing my ass off.

3340
02:16:52,291 --> 02:16:53,910
So when I go on stage I'm in a good 
mood.

3341
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:55,710
Like I'm laughing.
You know what I'm saying?

3342
02:16:55,890 --> 02:16:57,050
Like I feel like,
wow,

3343
02:16:57,080 --> 02:16:59,790
it was a fun fucking show.
This is fun and I just carry it on.

3344
02:17:00,050 --> 02:17:05,050
They get rocked.
If you don't have that kind of act 

3345
02:17:05,050 --> 02:17:08,300
though,
if you have the kind of act that's like 

3346
02:17:08,300 --> 02:17:08,300
really,
you know,

3347
02:17:08,300 --> 02:17:09,090
like a monologue act or someone who's 
like more sedated.

3348
02:17:09,091 --> 02:17:10,950
It doesn't talk about controversial 
subjects.

3349
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:12,840
The problem is once the cat's out of the
bag,

3350
02:17:13,050 --> 02:17:18,050
you know,
like once you start talking about wild 

3351
02:17:18,050 --> 02:17:18,050
shit,
when you're up there,

3352
02:17:18,050 --> 02:17:21,350
the guy after you,
it's going to be really hard for him to 

3353
02:17:21,350 --> 02:17:23,781
be like sedate.
It's going to be really hard for him to 

3354
02:17:23,781 --> 02:17:23,781
be like middle America,
you know,

3355
02:17:23,781 --> 02:17:26,550
fucking now ready for letterman.
You know what I mean?

3356
02:17:26,760 --> 02:17:29,550
There was a time when I used to struggle
at their.

3357
02:17:29,551 --> 02:17:32,250
John kept barolo because he was very 
mainstream,

3358
02:17:32,251 --> 02:17:37,251
lovable,
and I go up there with my weird stuff 

3359
02:17:37,251 --> 02:17:37,251
and you feel it,
right?

3360
02:17:37,251 --> 02:17:37,251
The.
Yeah.

3361
02:17:37,251 --> 02:17:37,251
And it's just like,
whoa.

3362
02:17:37,251 --> 02:17:37,560
Hey,
whoa,

3363
02:17:37,561 --> 02:17:38,130
whoa,
whoa.

3364
02:17:38,131 --> 02:17:39,020
We're just,
you know,

3365
02:17:39,021 --> 02:17:40,560
we've been.
We like ice cream.

3366
02:17:40,561 --> 02:17:41,730
Do you know what I'm saying?
You can't.

3367
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:43,580
You can't convert them yet.
That's what it is.

3368
02:17:43,581 --> 02:17:45,030
You don't know how to convert them yet,
you know,

3369
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:46,340
or you didn't at the time.
Rather.

3370
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:48,410
I used to feel that way about age agent 
mall.

3371
02:17:48,650 --> 02:17:53,650
Ha.
Jamal was joey diaz is kryptonite for a 

3372
02:17:53,650 --> 02:17:53,650
long time ago.
Modular lego.

3373
02:17:53,650 --> 02:17:55,850
That's a funny dude.
He's one of those guys.

3374
02:17:55,851 --> 02:17:58,820
There's a few guys where I go.
This doesn't make any sense.

3375
02:17:58,821 --> 02:18:00,710
How is this guy?
Not a huge household.

3376
02:18:00,740 --> 02:18:02,690
I'm with you dude.
Squeaky clean.

3377
02:18:02,810 --> 02:18:05,120
Hilarious,
brilliant timing.

3378
02:18:05,210 --> 02:18:08,120
Great writing.
fucking super nice guy.

3379
02:18:08,300 --> 02:18:11,470
Super nice friendly guy and here it is.
You know,

3380
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:12,860
we knew him from the store.
From what?

3381
02:18:12,861 --> 02:18:14,090
Ten years ago.
Here he is.

3382
02:18:14,330 --> 02:18:15,440
He's not famous,
you know,

3383
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:16,310
that's crazy to me.

3384
02:18:16,930 --> 02:18:18,640
I mean do people are like,
oh ha.

3385
02:18:18,641 --> 02:18:19,720
Jamal killed last time.
I was like,

3386
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:21,510
tell me when he doesn't kill.
That's why.

3387
02:18:21,550 --> 02:18:23,470
Because he murders room

3388
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:24,340
steward.
He's.

3389
02:18:24,370 --> 02:18:27,640
He was when we knew him too,
when he was at the store a lot.

3390
02:18:27,641 --> 02:18:31,000
Like in the early two thousands.
He was an executioner.

3391
02:18:31,001 --> 02:18:36,001
Brow.
He would go up and we did a lot of the 

3392
02:18:36,001 --> 02:18:38,131
same material,
but he would go up and do 15 minutes of 

3393
02:18:38,131 --> 02:18:40,450
thunder sun and it will be squeaky clean
and perfectly timed out and you know,

3394
02:18:40,451 --> 02:18:45,451
you would feel like,
especially if you have that lag of 

3395
02:18:45,451 --> 02:18:45,451
loose,
you know,

3396
02:18:45,451 --> 02:18:45,790
dirty style where you're talking shit on
stage,

3397
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:47,870
you'd feel like unprepared when you're 
gone,

3398
02:18:48,570 --> 02:18:53,570
you know,
because it's such a totally different 

3399
02:18:53,570 --> 02:18:53,570
style of comedy.
Funny man.

3400
02:18:53,570 --> 02:18:53,570
Yeah.
You always wonder that.

3401
02:18:53,570 --> 02:18:54,640
You know,
there's a lot of guys like that.

3402
02:18:54,641 --> 02:18:59,641
Man.
I always talk about reggie mcfadden 

3403
02:18:59,641 --> 02:19:01,300
regimen fat and back in New York in the 
nineties I knew reggie mcfadden like 93,

3404
02:19:01,301 --> 02:19:04,240
94.
He was a destroyer dude.

3405
02:19:04,241 --> 02:19:09,241
He would go up squeaky clean,
totally digestible for tv and he would 

3406
02:19:09,241 --> 02:19:13,351
just fucking crush.
He was a monster man and for whatever 

3407
02:19:13,351 --> 02:19:16,771
reason it just never connected.
I know he got on in living color like I 

3408
02:19:16,771 --> 02:19:18,130
think unlike the last season or one of 
the last seasons,

3409
02:19:18,370 --> 02:19:19,540
you know,
and he did a little bit on that,

3410
02:19:19,541 --> 02:19:21,220
but for whatever reason it never took 
off.

3411
02:19:21,370 --> 02:19:23,890
When I saw him,
I was like 22 or something like that.

3412
02:19:23,891 --> 02:19:25,210
When I first saw him,
I was like,

3413
02:19:25,211 --> 02:19:27,890
whoa,
this guy is going to be a fucking star.

3414
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:30,230
I'm like,
this guy is so charismatic.

3415
02:19:30,470 --> 02:19:32,360
His act was clean.
I wanted to like,

3416
02:19:32,361 --> 02:19:33,320
um,
like he would be on stage.

3417
02:19:33,321 --> 02:19:38,321
I was like,
I was learning from watching him 

3418
02:19:38,321 --> 02:19:38,321
perform.
Definitely,

3419
02:19:38,321 --> 02:19:41,310
you know,
there's guys that you've seen and you 

3420
02:19:41,310 --> 02:19:41,310
go,
man,

3421
02:19:41,310 --> 02:19:41,310
I learned something watching that guy,
I need to be more,

3422
02:19:41,310 --> 02:19:43,820
have more fun with this or I,
I enjoyed that part about his act,

3423
02:19:43,821 --> 02:19:44,540
you know?
Um,

3424
02:19:44,580 --> 02:19:44,900
what,
uh,

3425
02:19:44,910 --> 02:19:47,270
how come I'm like that in my real life,
but I'm not like that on stage.

3426
02:19:47,271 --> 02:19:49,070
I needed to learn how to be myself on 
stage.

3427
02:19:49,071 --> 02:19:49,940
Like he is,
you know,

3428
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:51,440
he was one of those dudes,
man,

3429
02:19:51,441 --> 02:19:53,780
he just fucking crushed,
crushed.

3430
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:55,250
You would just be humbled.
Like,

3431
02:19:55,251 --> 02:19:56,180
whoa,
that guy's good.

3432
02:19:56,450 --> 02:19:57,680
And then for whatever reason,
man,

3433
02:19:57,681 --> 02:20:00,530
I just never fucking clicked.
It never clicked.

3434
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:06,070
You know,
you never see him headlining these big 

3435
02:20:06,070 --> 02:20:06,070
shows that you hear about at these 
theaters and shit like that.

3436
02:20:06,860 --> 02:20:08,990
I don't even know where he is anymore.
I don't know where he is.

3437
02:20:08,991 --> 02:20:12,200
Either used to do poppins and I was 
like,

3438
02:20:12,201 --> 02:20:14,560
I don't know why this guy is popping and
he's not really celebrity.

3439
02:20:14,561 --> 02:20:16,510
It was always really funny,
but no,

3440
02:20:16,511 --> 02:20:18,410
I haven't seen him at the comedy store 
in years.

3441
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:19,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

3442
02:20:19,311 --> 02:20:20,270
He,
you do pop ins.

3443
02:20:20,271 --> 02:20:25,271
He had a little bit going on back in.
Know he did a movie like a little while 

3444
02:20:25,271 --> 02:20:25,940
ago.
Very funny though,

3445
02:20:25,941 --> 02:20:27,050
man.
Steve white.

3446
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:28,430
There's another one.
Steve white.

3447
02:20:28,910 --> 02:20:31,340
Steve white is fucking hilarious.
Dude.

3448
02:20:31,610 --> 02:20:33,620
That guy's one of the most confusing 
guys to me.

3449
02:20:33,621 --> 02:20:36,470
That and I know he made a ton of money 
off real estate.

3450
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:39,530
He became like some crazy fucking real 
estate investor and I think he does like

3451
02:20:39,550 --> 02:20:44,550
seminars now.
He has a radio show for awhile there in 

3452
02:20:44,550 --> 02:20:45,080
vegas.
Did he do that?

3453
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:46,010
I was funny as shit.

3454
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:47,810
He's another guy.
That guy should have been a giant.

3455
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:50,360
Should've been fucking headlining 
everywhere over the world.

3456
02:20:50,361 --> 02:20:52,700
We're talking about a bunch of people 
that no one knows about.

3457
02:20:53,530 --> 02:20:57,320
We're talking about comedy,
but there's also something about what we

3458
02:20:57,321 --> 02:20:58,400
knew about these people,
man.

3459
02:20:58,460 --> 02:21:03,460
Yeah,
but they don't have to know we're 

3460
02:21:03,460 --> 02:21:06,431
talking about,
but I'm listening to the little comics 

3461
02:21:06,431 --> 02:21:06,431
that we knew that were really funny and 
we're describing.

3462
02:21:06,431 --> 02:21:08,780
I know a lot of people asking like,
how do we know these people?

3463
02:21:08,781 --> 02:21:10,490
Why would we care about this?
Who are these people?

3464
02:21:10,730 --> 02:21:12,350
Stop reading that man.
Don't bring that up man.

3465
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:14,510
Hours,
20 minutes.

3466
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:19,540
Don't bring up negative shit.
You're bringing up negative shit that 

3467
02:21:19,540 --> 02:21:19,540
these people are saying that they're not
into it.

3468
02:21:19,540 --> 02:21:21,080
We're talking about comedy and what's 
our history and to us it's interesting.

3469
02:21:21,340 --> 02:21:22,550
People that are into comedy,
it's going to be.

3470
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:24,230
You're also putting on a show right now.
Yeah,

3471
02:21:24,310 --> 02:21:25,250
bro.
I know what I'm doing,

3472
02:21:25,251 --> 02:21:25,940
man.
Stop this.

3473
02:21:25,941 --> 02:21:27,290
Don't fucking tell me what to talk 
about.

3474
02:21:27,860 --> 02:21:30,950
I'm fascinated by this.
You're not helping.

3475
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:32,540
It's not helping bring it up.
Negative shit.

3476
02:21:32,541 --> 02:21:37,541
It's not helping.
It's interesting to me and I think I 

3477
02:21:37,541 --> 02:21:41,201
want to give guy credit and I want to 
give adrian jamal credit and I want to 

3478
02:21:41,201 --> 02:21:41,201
talk about all these guys.
They were fucking funny.

3479
02:21:41,201 --> 02:21:44,060
Genius guys that helped us when we were 
coming up,

3480
02:21:44,061 --> 02:21:45,740
you know,
watching all these different guys.

3481
02:21:45,890 --> 02:21:48,620
I think that's one of the most Important
things about comedy development is being

3482
02:21:48,621 --> 02:21:50,360
around a bunch of other really funny 
comedians,

3483
02:21:50,650 --> 02:21:51,230
you know,
and,

3484
02:21:51,231 --> 02:21:56,231
and like feeding off of each other.
And it's a blessing too because like 

3485
02:21:56,231 --> 02:21:56,420
being in la,
it's like,

3486
02:21:56,780 --> 02:21:58,990
believe it or not,
the comedy level so high,

3487
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:00,110
he's like,
you know,

3488
02:22:00,170 --> 02:22:05,170
I go on the road,
even if I'll go down to san diego or 

3489
02:22:05,170 --> 02:22:06,170
something and you see what they're used 
to seeing and they're performing at that

3490
02:22:06,171 --> 02:22:06,740
level.

3491
02:22:07,180 --> 02:22:09,110
It's like in la,
you know,

3492
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:14,200
you know,
I had to either for god knows how many 

3493
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:14,200
times they had to follow you at the 
comedy store and it's like,

3494
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:15,710
I can't fuck around with that.
You know,

3495
02:22:15,740 --> 02:22:20,740
all these other great comics.
LiKe you see what you got to get to and 

3496
02:22:20,740 --> 02:22:24,491
where are you going to operate at?
And god knows I had to follow a lot of 

3497
02:22:24,491 --> 02:22:27,401
guys too.
And that's one of the things that mitzi 

3498
02:22:27,401 --> 02:22:27,401
shore a really helped me and a lot of 
other comedians with.

3499
02:22:27,401 --> 02:22:29,070
She knew how to schedule guys,
you know,

3500
02:22:29,190 --> 02:22:30,630
and she always would talk to me about 
it,

3501
02:22:30,631 --> 02:22:31,440
you know,
and I told her,

3502
02:22:31,441 --> 02:22:31,920
I said,
you know,

3503
02:22:31,921 --> 02:22:33,440
you really made me,
uh,

3504
02:22:33,450 --> 02:22:38,450
you know,
you really helped my development as a 

3505
02:22:38,450 --> 02:22:38,450
comedian.
She goes,

3506
02:22:38,450 --> 02:22:38,450
I always nowhere and I pull it.
Yeah.

3507
02:22:38,450 --> 02:22:40,670
You know,
she will put me over after murderers,

3508
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:42,240
man,
martin lawrence and his prime.

3509
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:45,640
He would go up in the main room and 
fucking destroyed.

3510
02:22:45,641 --> 02:22:47,040
Dude.
It was back when he had that.

3511
02:22:47,041 --> 02:22:50,040
What was that movie that he had the 
concert movie of him doing standup,

3512
02:22:50,820 --> 02:22:54,390
something run something crazy,
wasn't it you so crazy or something like

3513
02:22:54,391 --> 02:22:55,120
that.
I don't know.

3514
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:57,720
Someone was brian.
Anyway,

3515
02:22:57,750 --> 02:23:00,210
he,
he used to destroy.

3516
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:05,420
He would level that main room.
Then I would go up and I was nobody and 

3517
02:23:05,420 --> 02:23:06,570
I wasn't very confident and people,
as soon as they saw me,

3518
02:23:06,571 --> 02:23:09,810
they would get up and leave.
But how many times in my life,

3519
02:23:09,811 --> 02:23:11,940
dude,
for like the first year is at the store.

3520
02:23:12,180 --> 02:23:15,630
Andrew dice clay pretty much bumped me 
every night.

3521
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:17,280
I know,
man.

3522
02:23:17,281 --> 02:23:18,570
It was brutal.
Dice,

3523
02:23:18,571 --> 02:23:23,571
dice.
They were scheduled him before me a 

3524
02:23:23,571 --> 02:23:26,511
bunch of times or after hammer other a 
bunch of times I'd have to go up after 

3525
02:23:26,511 --> 02:23:28,860
him and I used to listen to his cds or 
cassettes rather.

3526
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:33,860
They were cassettes back in the eighties
to one of my favorite moments was 

3527
02:23:33,860 --> 02:23:35,190
watching him on new year's doing his 
nursery rhymes.

3528
02:23:35,380 --> 02:23:38,260
Yeah.
See that live when I grew up on that was

3529
02:23:38,261 --> 02:23:43,261
like phenomenal.
There was an hbo special that was live 

3530
02:23:43,261 --> 02:23:43,261
right from philly,
wasn't it?

3531
02:23:43,261 --> 02:23:43,261
Or he.
Yeah,

3532
02:23:43,261 --> 02:23:45,030
and then I saw them do it in the olr one
time on new years.

3533
02:23:45,031 --> 02:23:45,720
I'm like,
wow,

3534
02:23:45,721 --> 02:23:47,640
that's pretty damn cool,
man.

3535
02:23:47,790 --> 02:23:52,790
Dude.
I remember working with him just being 

3536
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:52,790
like standing next to him going,
holy shit,

3537
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:53,200
this is dyce client.
Yep.

3538
02:23:53,480 --> 02:23:58,480
You know,
to me it's like right there with 

3539
02:23:58,480 --> 02:23:58,480
kennison as far as like the 
Impressionable comics.

3540
02:23:58,480 --> 02:23:58,480
I mean,
you know,

3541
02:23:58,480 --> 02:24:03,110
people say he's an asshole.
He just hate comedy and isn't that I 

3542
02:24:03,110 --> 02:24:03,110
don't care.
To me,

3543
02:24:03,110 --> 02:24:03,520
it's funny,
you know,

3544
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:05,340
I'm not looking to,
for him to have the,

3545
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:07,620
you know,
the best philosophy in life and teach me

3546
02:24:07,621 --> 02:24:09,300
how to live my life,
but he,

3547
02:24:09,301 --> 02:24:14,301
he's made me laugh hard before when I 
was a kid and insulting people at the 

3548
02:24:14,301 --> 02:24:14,340
store.

3549
02:24:15,030 --> 02:24:17,070
How many times does he just started 
attacking dudes?

3550
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:20,710
oh,
he texts his own fans are awesome dice.

3551
02:24:20,730 --> 02:24:22,560
Hey,
fuck you dude.

3552
02:24:22,561 --> 02:24:25,590
He's ruthless.
He's ruthless shitting on people he does

3553
02:24:25,591 --> 02:24:27,130
not care to.
Yeah.

3554
02:24:27,150 --> 02:24:29,400
That,
that comedy store environment growing up

3555
02:24:29,401 --> 02:24:32,550
in that crazy fall.
Eddie griffin,

3556
02:24:32,551 --> 02:24:34,620
after he did three hours,
I've seen that.

3557
02:24:34,621 --> 02:24:39,621
I've seen you follow him.
I saw you follow him at least twice 

3558
02:24:39,621 --> 02:24:42,530
after he did three hours and the people 
were just destroyed by the time it was 

3559
02:24:42,530 --> 02:24:42,530
over.
They had nothing left in them.

3560
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:46,200
By the time eddie,
eddie would start off doing material and

3561
02:24:46,201 --> 02:24:47,760
then two hours in,
he'd be like,

3562
02:24:47,910 --> 02:24:51,480
the africans built the pyramids with 
sound.

3563
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:53,160
See,
y'all don't understand.

3564
02:24:53,310 --> 02:24:58,310
Nine slash 11 happened.
There was gold underneath those twIn 

3565
02:24:58,310 --> 02:25:01,500
towers.
Subway ran 24 hours a day.

3566
02:25:02,540 --> 02:25:06,060
Like you'd like to leave you like,
what the fuck is he saying now?

3567
02:25:06,061 --> 02:25:08,550
I don't know what's going on.
I think kat williams just came,

3568
02:25:08,551 --> 02:25:11,250
took all this thunder and then,
I don't know man.

3569
02:25:11,251 --> 02:25:13,950
Well he had a problem opening up for 
certain guys.

3570
02:25:13,951 --> 02:25:14,280
He's like,
oh,

3571
02:25:14,290 --> 02:25:16,920
but I think it was mike apps.
I think you were open for he.

3572
02:25:17,220 --> 02:25:19,620
He was opening for some guys and like 
they just weren't.

3573
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:24,680
Maybe it was kat williams.
They were just not into a shit man 

3574
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:24,680
because he's got that style that

3575
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:26,220
just shit talk and style,
you know,

3576
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:31,230
he's like suited to.
I think eddie's like at his best when 

3577
02:25:31,230 --> 02:25:34,621
he's like in like the oh are and it's 
like a friday night and they don't 

3578
02:25:34,621 --> 02:25:36,040
expect them and he goes out,
but he's feeling just perfect.

3579
02:25:36,041 --> 02:25:41,041
You've got to just the right amount to 
drink and just the right amount of 

3580
02:25:41,041 --> 02:25:41,041
feeling good and he'll go up there and 
fucking slay it.

3581
02:25:41,110 --> 02:25:44,200
But do you remember back when he had his
first hbo appearance?

3582
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:49,500
Now he's like a young comedian specials 
or something or def jam maybe it was 

3583
02:25:49,500 --> 02:25:49,500
deaf jam.
Yes,

3584
02:25:49,500 --> 02:25:52,810
it was deaf jam.
And he fucking destroyed 80.

3585
02:25:52,811 --> 02:25:57,811
Griffin was one of the most fucking 
charismatic and powerful standups ever 

3586
02:25:57,811 --> 02:26:00,220
for like a short period of time you 
would go to see like his,

3587
02:26:00,250 --> 02:26:03,580
his like hbo performance when he was on 
def jam at the time.

3588
02:26:03,581 --> 02:26:06,250
But the impact that it happened,
I remember watching it being like,

3589
02:26:06,340 --> 02:26:08,650
whoa,
this guy's fucking talented.

3590
02:26:08,950 --> 02:26:13,950
Just powerful and dynamic and all this 
energy and woo and good man.

3591
02:26:14,471 --> 02:26:19,471
It was good fucking material.
But somewhere along the line he just 

3592
02:26:19,471 --> 02:26:19,471
went crazy.

3593
02:26:19,471 --> 02:26:21,380
Yeah.
I don't know what did do three hours and

3594
02:26:21,381 --> 02:26:26,381
45 minutes of it was gold.
There was some really funny as shit.

3595
02:26:26,840 --> 02:26:28,760
He would say shit.
Sometimes it would make me go.

3596
02:26:28,770 --> 02:26:31,580
This guy like in spurts is like one of 
the funniest ever.

3597
02:26:31,670 --> 02:26:36,670
One of the funniest ever.
Do you ever heard his bit about 

3598
02:26:36,670 --> 02:26:36,670
Alexander Graham bell is do a bit about 
cocaine.

3599
02:26:36,670 --> 02:26:38,510
Then Alexander Graham bell invented the 
telephone.

3600
02:26:39,230 --> 02:26:44,230
He's like,
you gotta be has motherfucker want to 

3601
02:26:44,230 --> 02:26:45,700
talk to someone who ain't even there.
That's funny.

3602
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:50,720
Shit.
How much coke you got to do before you 

3603
02:26:50,720 --> 02:26:51,890
like,
I want to talk to some nigga.

3604
02:26:51,891 --> 02:26:54,320
Ain't even here.
It's a funny bit,

3605
02:26:54,321 --> 02:26:56,930
man.
He had some funny fucking shit,

3606
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:58,430
but it was bursts of it,
you know,

3607
02:26:58,580 --> 02:27:00,830
bursts of genius followed by all this 
time.

3608
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:03,990
I just think like in la,
like when you're doing like a set psych,

3609
02:27:04,010 --> 02:27:07,220
people can only take so much and like 
three hours.

3610
02:27:07,220 --> 02:27:09,470
Nobody could take three hours of 
anybody.

3611
02:27:09,590 --> 02:27:12,320
I don't think anybody.
Would you ever want to hear anything you

3612
02:27:12,321 --> 02:27:15,830
think about like these chappelle in 
these dane cook sets?

3613
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:19,050
What do you guys think about those sets 
were dudes do like six,

3614
02:27:19,060 --> 02:27:19,920
seven,
trusting.

3615
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:22,010
I hate it.
I think it's the worst idea ever.

3616
02:27:22,011 --> 02:27:24,140
I think.
I think less is always more.

3617
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:29,150
I always found it interesting that date 
that dane always got like a bad,

3618
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:32,240
you know,
energy from that.

3619
02:27:32,241 --> 02:27:34,940
And then for the longest time nobody 
cared about dave chappelle.

3620
02:27:34,941 --> 02:27:36,980
No one would ever be like fucking 
chappelle bummy.

3621
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:37,670
They'd be like,
yeah,

3622
02:27:37,671 --> 02:27:39,530
chappelle went up to three hours.
it was awesome.

3623
02:27:39,830 --> 02:27:41,660
Well,
he seems now it's kind of changed,

3624
02:27:41,661 --> 02:27:42,580
but at the time

3625
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:44,020
time,
like ran up to the chappelle show,

3626
02:27:44,021 --> 02:27:45,550
especially after he left,
he was like,

3627
02:27:45,551 --> 02:27:47,500
this martyr for comedy.
You know,

3628
02:27:47,501 --> 02:27:52,501
because everybody had heard that like 
the comedy central suits were fucking 

3629
02:27:52,501 --> 02:27:55,891
with his show and trying to get him to 
stop saying nigger and trying to sell 

3630
02:27:55,891 --> 02:27:56,170
more advertising and they wanted to kill
them more money.

3631
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:59,170
There's a big $50,000,000
deal and he just went fuck you.

3632
02:27:59,171 --> 02:28:02,050
And walked away.
And I think everybody just,

3633
02:28:02,051 --> 02:28:03,940
he became the messiah,
you know,

3634
02:28:03,941 --> 02:28:05,530
every comic was like,
wow,

3635
02:28:05,770 --> 02:28:10,770
that guy's a real fucking comic.
Like he really walked away from $50 

3636
02:28:10,770 --> 02:28:12,880
million dollars.
Who the fuck walks away from $50,

3637
02:28:12,881 --> 02:28:17,881
million dollars?
Who gets in a fucking plane and just 

3638
02:28:17,881 --> 02:28:17,881
goes to africa?
So for us,

3639
02:28:17,881 --> 02:28:20,650
like he embodied everything that a real 
comic is supposed to be.

3640
02:28:21,020 --> 02:28:22,040
Dude's a genius

3641
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:23,890
comedian.
Hilarious as fuck.

3642
02:28:23,910 --> 02:28:26,910
Had the funniest show in the history of 
television change.

3643
02:28:26,980 --> 02:28:30,920
Did it change the way people thought?
Yeah,

3644
02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:36,160
I mean it was that.
I mean like stuff that he did on the 

3645
02:28:36,160 --> 02:28:37,430
show became part of the lexicon.
I'm rich bitch.

3646
02:28:37,431 --> 02:28:39,110
How many people just would yell that 
out?

3647
02:28:39,590 --> 02:28:41,390
How many people yell out fuck your 
couch.

3648
02:28:41,750 --> 02:28:43,280
You know how many people would yell out 
all that stuff?

3649
02:28:43,281 --> 02:28:45,640
That stuff became.
It just,

3650
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:49,040
it just,
it had an impact that nothing else did,

3651
02:28:49,041 --> 02:28:54,041
man.
And so when he stepped away from that 

3652
02:28:54,041 --> 02:28:54,041
and everybody was like,
wow,

3653
02:28:54,041 --> 02:28:56,570
he really doesn't give a fuck.
He was mad at him at all.

3654
02:28:56,571 --> 02:28:59,690
I always wonder if like,
you killed like the golden goose.

3655
02:29:00,380 --> 02:29:01,940
it was all fake.
No,

3656
02:29:02,070 --> 02:29:04,010
he can sell so much,
man.

3657
02:29:04,011 --> 02:29:06,350
He can do whatever he wants.
I don't think he gives a fuck.

3658
02:29:06,620 --> 02:29:08,050
If he wanted to sell out stadiums,
dude,

3659
02:29:08,051 --> 02:29:08,840
he could sell out stadiums.

3660
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:13,840
He's not trying.
He's showing up at comedy clubs like 

3661
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:16,091
unannounced and shit.
He's showing up and doing guest spots 

3662
02:29:16,091 --> 02:29:16,710
and shit and going up for a couple of 
hours here and there where he's not even

3663
02:29:16,711 --> 02:29:19,790
like having people pay to see him.
He's not doing that many real shows.

3664
02:29:20,180 --> 02:29:22,700
He's a,
an interesting motherfucker man.

3665
02:29:23,030 --> 02:29:28,030
Very interesting.
But I think that's really why everybody 

3666
02:29:28,030 --> 02:29:28,030
doesn't care that he goes up like we all
want to see him.

3667
02:29:28,030 --> 02:29:30,050
You know,
he represents to a lot of comics,

3668
02:29:30,051 --> 02:29:32,240
like he's the embodiment of what you're 
supposed to be.

3669
02:29:32,241 --> 02:29:34,730
He's like the richard pryor of our 
generation.

3670
02:29:34,731 --> 02:29:39,731
Yeah.
The guy who goes up and everybody wants 

3671
02:29:39,731 --> 02:29:39,731
to sit and watch them,
you know?

3672
02:29:39,731 --> 02:29:40,460
Is he your favorite comic?
Who's your favorite comic?

3673
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,580
Uh,
I have,

3674
02:29:42,620 --> 02:29:43,100
uh,
uh,

3675
02:29:43,130 --> 02:29:46,540
david tells one of my favorites.
I just love the way he writes in.

3676
02:29:46,540 --> 02:29:48,370
His tags are really good.
I like,

3677
02:29:48,371 --> 02:29:52,230
uh,
you stand hope bill burn and you know,

3678
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:56,570
nick swardson I think is really fucking 
funny.

3679
02:29:56,690 --> 02:30:00,440
His specials,
one of the only specials I like for some

3680
02:30:00,441 --> 02:30:02,120
reason I can't watch comedy,
man.

3681
02:30:02,121 --> 02:30:03,700
I don't know what it is.
I've been,

3682
02:30:04,340 --> 02:30:06,770
I dunno man.
So I'll watch like clumps,

3683
02:30:07,130 --> 02:30:11,540
but somehow I got through his whole 
entire special laughing my ass off man.

3684
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:13,430
Yeah,
he's really funny dude.

3685
02:30:13,520 --> 02:30:16,070
That fucking thing that he does what he 
said,

3686
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:21,080
if I was going to commit suicide,
I want everybody to be really confused 

3687
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:24,011
after it was over,
like pull out a gun and go who fucking 

3688
02:30:24,011 --> 02:30:26,510
farted brains out.
That's hilarious.

3689
02:30:26,511 --> 02:30:31,511
Shit dude.
And he's goT great stage presence and 

3690
02:30:31,511 --> 02:30:34,571
delivery.
I was in minneapolis and he was there 

3691
02:30:34,571 --> 02:30:37,451
too,
is when brock lesnar was fighting and 

3692
02:30:37,451 --> 02:30:37,451
uh,
it was the night before we did a show at

3693
02:30:37,451 --> 02:30:40,931
the fine line music cafe and swarts and 
came to the show and he just walked on 

3694
02:30:40,931 --> 02:30:44,300
stage while I was on stage and he's,
he's like one of those dudes who like,

3695
02:30:44,360 --> 02:30:45,260
I love him so much.

3696
02:30:45,260 --> 02:30:47,300
He's so fun to be around.
I'm always happy to see him,

3697
02:30:47,540 --> 02:30:50,650
like one of the few dudes that would 
show up and then just walk on stage.

3698
02:30:50,670 --> 02:30:52,280
I just give him the microphone and give 
him a hug,

3699
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:53,810
you know what I mean?
like I'd be happy.

3700
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:57,470
It's like a for him it was like,
it was like a cool thing on stage.

3701
02:30:57,471 --> 02:30:59,180
He's a great guy,
great guy.

3702
02:30:59,580 --> 02:31:04,580
I used to do beecher's madhouse at the 
hard rock in vegas and he came out and 

3703
02:31:04,911 --> 02:31:07,100
party one night and then he just 
disappeared.

3704
02:31:07,810 --> 02:31:10,130
He showed up the next day and he's like,
I'm like,

3705
02:31:10,131 --> 02:31:10,970
where'd you go?
He goes,

3706
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:12,210
you don't want no,
and I'm like,

3707
02:31:12,211 --> 02:31:15,830
you know what?
I felt so fun,

3708
02:31:15,831 --> 02:31:16,460
dude.
Man,

3709
02:31:16,490 --> 02:31:19,010
he's a great guy,
but he's one of those guys like he could

3710
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:24,020
probably do that to you.
He would go onstage and you'd be happy 

3711
02:31:24,020 --> 02:31:24,020
to see them on stage with you.

3712
02:31:24,020 --> 02:31:24,020
Like,
oh yeah man,

3713
02:31:24,020 --> 02:31:25,140
but how many guys are like that?
There's so few.

3714
02:31:25,500 --> 02:31:30,500
You know,
I don't know anybody who I would be 

3715
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:30,500
comfortable going on stage on their 
show.

3716
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:33,780
I don'T know anybody who walks up.
He's like,

3717
02:31:33,810 --> 02:31:35,880
what the fuck man,
I would never do that with you.

3718
02:31:35,881 --> 02:31:37,920
Like if you were doing a show somewhere 
and I came to watch,

3719
02:31:38,190 --> 02:31:43,190
I would never go on stage and just 
assume that we're going to give you the 

3720
02:31:43,190 --> 02:31:43,190
microphone.
I'd start talking to be like,

3721
02:31:43,190 --> 02:31:43,590
dude,
what the fuck?

3722
02:31:43,591 --> 02:31:45,190
You don't do enough shows.
Yeah,

3723
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:50,130
come steal my thunder mother fucker.
You happened to jen kirkman.

3724
02:31:50,170 --> 02:31:55,170
She's a comic.
Last night she went off on her twitter 

3725
02:31:55,170 --> 02:31:56,700
because she had a 30 minute spot at the 
improv and somebody went on stage.

3726
02:31:56,701 --> 02:31:59,700
She didn't say who it was,
jumped on stage and didn't,

3727
02:31:59,790 --> 02:32:02,400
but she was going crazy both on the,
the,

3728
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:04,140
you know,
the improv,

3729
02:32:04,141 --> 02:32:04,600
the emotion.

3730
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:07,230
But you read her shit,
jen kirkman,

3731
02:32:07,260 --> 02:32:09,190
you agreed.
I don't know.

3732
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:12,450
He was a contestant or you worked for 
last comic standing,

3733
02:32:12,451 --> 02:32:14,650
but she never said she wouldn't say who 
it was.

3734
02:32:14,690 --> 02:32:16,020
greg giraldo?
no,

3735
02:32:16,050 --> 02:32:16,500
no,
no.

3736
02:32:16,501 --> 02:32:17,940
It wasn't great.
So how much time did they do?

3737
02:32:18,020 --> 02:32:18,900
I liked,
I don't know.

3738
02:32:18,901 --> 02:32:20,310
I don't know,
but just to check our twitter.

3739
02:32:20,311 --> 02:32:22,420
It's pretty days on that show,
but I like trello.

3740
02:32:22,590 --> 02:32:24,690
I looked up to.
That's life man.

3741
02:32:24,750 --> 02:32:27,270
You know comics are going to go on 
before you and bump you especially.

3742
02:32:27,271 --> 02:32:27,990
No one knows.
Who the fuck are you?

3743
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:29,980
I'm so numb to it,
man.

3744
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:34,600
It's amazing how everyone gets so angry.
I am so numb to getting bumped

3745
02:32:34,860 --> 02:32:35,670
test,
man.

3746
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:40,700
It's a test for comics.
It's good for you when you're starting 

3747
02:32:40,700 --> 02:32:44,301
out.
It's not good when you get to a certain 

3748
02:32:44,301 --> 02:32:45,711
level and people are paying to see you 
and somewhat contrary to your point of 

3749
02:32:45,711 --> 02:32:46,260
view goes on and goes up.
You know like,

3750
02:32:46,290 --> 02:32:47,850
like you know what I'm saying?

3751
02:32:48,190 --> 02:32:53,190
Agreements.
See story was headlining addison improv 

3752
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:57,770
and I'm sitting there in the back office
and all of a sudden I see brad williams 

3753
02:32:57,770 --> 02:32:57,930
walk and I'm like,
hey brad.

3754
02:32:57,931 --> 02:33:01,780
I'm like,
oh fuck him walks fucking carlos mencia.

3755
02:33:03,090 --> 02:33:08,090
He fucking does 30 minutes.
I can't even get away from him and 

3756
02:33:08,090 --> 02:33:10,140
dallas does 30 minutes before me.
Doesn't even ask me like,

3757
02:33:10,141 --> 02:33:10,830
doesn't he?
Hey dude,

3758
02:33:10,831 --> 02:33:13,440
you mind if I do 30 minutes?
Doesn't even ask.

3759
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:15,570
Just soon as he's doing it.
Does it on purpose?

3760
02:33:15,571 --> 02:33:17,070
He did it to put you in place.
I mean,

3761
02:33:17,071 --> 02:33:19,950
that's what he did this to.
Everybody goes up there,

3762
02:33:20,430 --> 02:33:21,930
right?
I tell him,

3763
02:33:21,931 --> 02:33:23,370
I go,
he goes over 30 minutes.

3764
02:33:23,371 --> 02:33:27,420
I ain't going onstage.
He gets off at 27 minutes.

3765
02:33:27,810 --> 02:33:29,940
He's killing.
And he goes,

3766
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:30,870
thank you guys.
So much.

3767
02:33:30,871 --> 02:33:32,400
Place goes nuts.
And they go,

3768
02:33:32,540 --> 02:33:33,270
right?
He goes,

3769
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:34,890
are you ready for your next comedian?

3770
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:39,570
And the whole place literally goes like,
someone's got filed this.

3771
02:33:40,290 --> 02:33:42,510
This is crazy.
I walked to the stage.

3772
02:33:42,511 --> 02:33:45,390
He introduces me.
I'm want to say he doesn't even wait for

3773
02:33:45,391 --> 02:33:48,480
me to be to get to the stage.
Literally.

3774
02:33:49,550 --> 02:33:54,550
I've never seen anyone do this before.
Runs a full sprint off the stage to the 

3775
02:33:54,661 --> 02:33:57,840
side,
to his left leaves the stage gmt.

3776
02:33:58,530 --> 02:34:01,410
I go up to make you feel uncomfortable.
I get up there.

3777
02:34:01,411 --> 02:34:03,310
I got this joke.
I always drop when I fall.

3778
02:34:03,311 --> 02:34:04,890
Big name somewhere.
Drop it.

3779
02:34:04,891 --> 02:34:07,590
Place goes nuts.
I kill for 45 minutes.

3780
02:34:08,550 --> 02:34:10,530
Like the crowd was like,
we can fucking do this.

3781
02:34:10,531 --> 02:34:11,970
You know what I'm saying?
Money.

3782
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,150
You know,
they didn't know.

3783
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:15,190
They probably.
A lot of them didn't know who you were.

3784
02:34:15,191 --> 02:34:20,191
They were just going to see some comedy 
and they've maybe heard your name or 

3785
02:34:20,191 --> 02:34:20,200
something like that,
but he was as national headline of go,

3786
02:34:20,201 --> 02:34:21,480
just destroyed.
Oh,

3787
02:34:21,481 --> 02:34:24,700
in just trying to bury me.
That's what he loves to do.

3788
02:34:24,701 --> 02:34:26,230
he's a sick person,
man.

3789
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:29,380
You know the mark marin podcast was 
fascinating.

3790
02:34:29,381 --> 02:34:31,510
Listen to it because it was like 
listening to a crazy person.

3791
02:34:31,780 --> 02:34:34,630
The crazy thing is he bumped marin.
Marin was at the improv once.

3792
02:34:34,631 --> 02:34:39,631
He bumped marin for like an hour.
Marin didn't even say anything to them 

3793
02:34:39,631 --> 02:34:39,631
until the second podcast.
You know,

3794
02:34:39,631 --> 02:34:40,480
the first time he didn't bring it up 
like,

3795
02:34:40,481 --> 02:34:41,710
hey,
why'd you bump me for an hour?

3796
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:46,090
I'll fuck you forget that.
See that whole thing about that video is

3797
02:34:46,091 --> 02:34:51,091
man,
it's like he brought that on himself to 

3798
02:34:51,091 --> 02:34:51,091
new videos.

3799
02:34:51,091 --> 02:34:55,680
The craziest thing ever.
That's just flat out positions and 

3800
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:57,550
that's where he is where you are.
It's obvious who was on stage for.

3801
02:34:57,580 --> 02:34:58,750
You know what I'm saying?
It's like,

3802
02:34:58,990 --> 02:35:03,990
I mean,
you were there before you left and you 

3803
02:35:03,990 --> 02:35:03,990
came back,
right?

3804
02:35:03,990 --> 02:35:04,660
Yes.
So he brought that on self.

3805
02:35:04,661 --> 02:35:07,990
I didn't see what the situation of 
bullying or anything like that.

3806
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:10,390
That's his mare and being silly marries 
a contrarian.

3807
02:35:10,391 --> 02:35:15,391
He's always trying to find some fucking 
unique angle that other people don't 

3808
02:35:15,391 --> 02:35:15,391
see.
That's my biggest problem.

3809
02:35:15,391 --> 02:35:15,670
So he's still,
he's complained about,

3810
02:35:15,671 --> 02:35:20,671
and I love baron,
you can't complain about joke stealing 

3811
02:35:20,671 --> 02:35:23,310
and then he did a lot of dumb shit.
Not only did they complete,

3812
02:35:23,380 --> 02:35:28,380
this is what marin does.
Marin compared it to people being 

3813
02:35:28,380 --> 02:35:29,200
influenced by people that there are 
other people that sound like people,

3814
02:35:29,201 --> 02:35:29,660
which is.
I've,

3815
02:35:29,750 --> 02:35:30,600
I've been guilty of.

3816
02:35:30,650 --> 02:35:31,420
we've all been given.
Yeah,

3817
02:35:31,421 --> 02:35:32,480
I think everybody is,
yeah,

3818
02:35:32,500 --> 02:35:34,420
when you get influenced by people,
but that's not.

3819
02:35:34,421 --> 02:35:37,780
Plagiarism does a huge fucking 
difference between that plagiarism.

3820
02:35:37,781 --> 02:35:42,781
It's a ridiculous comparison and the 
other thing that he said was that I 

3821
02:35:42,781 --> 02:35:42,781
thought was really kind of fucked up was
like that,

3822
02:35:42,781 --> 02:35:47,431
like he made it through comedy,
did everything to comedy and just had a 

3823
02:35:47,431 --> 02:35:49,120
lot of hard work and he can't wait to 
take away the fact that he worked hard.

3824
02:35:49,121 --> 02:35:50,740
Like what the fuck are you talking 
about?

3825
02:35:50,890 --> 02:35:55,890
You're talking about a guy who's 
stealing and then he also said that he 

3826
02:35:55,890 --> 02:35:55,890
thought that the video should have been 
released,

3827
02:35:55,890 --> 02:35:57,070
that we should have handled this within 
the community.

3828
02:35:57,220 --> 02:35:59,290
This is all coming from a guy who's got 
a fucking podcast.

3829
02:35:59,291 --> 02:36:04,291
We're four hours talking about it 
sounded like a 10 minute video or 

3830
02:36:04,291 --> 02:36:06,850
podcast talking about it on more than 
one occasion.

3831
02:36:06,850 --> 02:36:10,450
It's ridiculous.
Silly marin's fucking karma,

3832
02:36:10,480 --> 02:36:11,980
bro.
That's what that was,

3833
02:36:12,220 --> 02:36:14,500
man.
Nobody wanted that to happen,

3834
02:36:14,530 --> 02:36:15,340
you know?
I didn't know.

3835
02:36:15,341 --> 02:36:20,341
I just wanted him to not be there.
I wanted him to not do what he was 

3836
02:36:20,341 --> 02:36:23,401
doing.
We didn't want to set out to try to 

3837
02:36:23,401 --> 02:36:23,401
fucking destroy somebody.
It was.

3838
02:36:23,401 --> 02:36:24,910
We had a problem we had a deal with,
but how,

3839
02:36:25,240 --> 02:36:30,240
how bad was the store?
How many times have you seen people 

3840
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:32,941
freak the fuck out?
Because that guy was in the back of the 

3841
02:36:32,941 --> 02:36:32,941
room.
I don't do.

3842
02:36:32,941 --> 02:36:34,080
I did.
The funniest thing about him is like,

3843
02:36:34,150 --> 02:36:38,860
he's so easy to follow if like if I 
actually did my material,

3844
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:44,040
it's so easy to follow,
but you don't want to do your good shit 

3845
02:36:44,040 --> 02:36:44,140
because it was in the room.
Right?

3846
02:36:44,170 --> 02:36:47,710
So I just go to crowd work and sometimes
it goes great and sometimes it doesn't.

3847
02:36:47,710 --> 02:36:48,980
I just,
you know,

3848
02:36:49,180 --> 02:36:54,180
that was what was missing from this 
whole discussion with the real problem 

3849
02:36:54,180 --> 02:36:55,390
with having something like that is not 
whether or not anyone's free of guilt.

3850
02:36:55,420 --> 02:36:58,000
The real problem is what the situation 
is.

3851
02:36:58,001 --> 02:37:03,001
As someone who is ruining an artistic 
environment and creating a bunch of 

3852
02:37:03,001 --> 02:37:04,510
stress and tension all for their own 
personal gain.

3853
02:37:04,511 --> 02:37:08,470
And this isn't respected by the other 
people that are selling the art form.

3854
02:37:08,471 --> 02:37:09,940
The people that are owning the comedy 
club,

3855
02:37:10,090 --> 02:37:12,340
that people that are like the only 
reason why a comedy club is open,

3856
02:37:12,341 --> 02:37:17,341
it's not just a place to buy drinks.
It's a place to watch comedians perform 

3857
02:37:17,341 --> 02:37:17,341
and who you

3858
02:37:17,341 --> 02:37:20,600
got someone who's actively victimizing 
the other participants in this community

3859
02:37:20,601 --> 02:37:23,640
that keeps you alive and you're letting 
that person for short term.

3860
02:37:23,740 --> 02:37:26,620
I don't get it.
It's just they're not artists.

3861
02:37:26,621 --> 02:37:28,540
They're selling art.
They are not artists.

3862
02:37:28,541 --> 02:37:31,270
They don't respect it the way an artist 
respects,

3863
02:37:31,310 --> 02:37:32,130
you know,
and,

3864
02:37:32,370 --> 02:37:37,370
and you know,
just things he said on that podcast in 

3865
02:37:37,370 --> 02:37:38,200
terms of just,
you know,

3866
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:40,520
he sits still.
He acts,

3867
02:37:40,540 --> 02:37:45,540
he says he doesn't sit in a room,
he sits in the room texting who you 

3868
02:37:45,540 --> 02:37:45,540
texting,
your texting yourself.

3869
02:37:45,540 --> 02:37:49,330
I mean it's like if you really wanted 
people not to hate you anymore,

3870
02:37:49,420 --> 02:37:51,580
you would never go in the room when you 
weren't performing.

3871
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:55,090
I have this theory dude,
like if if you're a guy who's been doing

3872
02:37:55,091 --> 02:37:59,350
comedy over like 10 to 12 years and 
you're like watching like open mics,

3873
02:37:59,740 --> 02:38:02,740
you're probably,
they're fishing for material

3874
02:38:03,440 --> 02:38:08,440
or you could be a really curious person 
wants to see the beginnings again and 

3875
02:38:08,440 --> 02:38:11,541
see horrible failures and see like what 
it feels like to watch somebody like 

3876
02:38:11,541 --> 02:38:13,040
real nervous and uncomfortable to sit 
there the whole night and just be.

3877
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:14,190
Who knows,
you know.

3878
02:38:14,191 --> 02:38:19,191
I mean,
I'm not saying that anybody watching an 

3879
02:38:19,191 --> 02:38:19,191
open mic night is definitely a thief,
but suspect there's.

3880
02:38:19,191 --> 02:38:24,020
You can get.
You can cherry pick some great ideas 

3881
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:24,020
that people don't know how to work in an
open mic night.

3882
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:24,460
Right?
I mean,

3883
02:38:24,630 --> 02:38:26,820
how many times you watched an open mic 
night not micro go,

3884
02:38:26,821 --> 02:38:27,720
wow,
that's a good idea.

3885
02:38:27,721 --> 02:38:30,300
He's not doing it right,
but that's a great fucking idea of using

3886
02:38:30,301 --> 02:38:32,250
go tell them how to tweak it.
Yeah,

3887
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:33,570
that's a nice thing to do,
man.

3888
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:36,930
I've had people do that to me and it's 
really cool when someone comes up to you

3889
02:38:36,931 --> 02:38:38,910
like lucy kay was the last one to do 
that to me.

3890
02:38:38,911 --> 02:38:43,911
He saw my sat and then afterwards he 
actually wrote a bunch of shit down and 

3891
02:38:43,911 --> 02:38:44,190
he gave me a couple of cool ideas.
Cool.

3892
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:47,070
That's another thing.
He's a great guy.

3893
02:38:47,450 --> 02:38:52,450
He's,
I think he's the best right now as far 

3894
02:38:52,450 --> 02:38:52,450
as like,
he's the most prolific,

3895
02:38:52,450 --> 02:38:53,760
you know,
he's the patent as well.

3896
02:38:53,761 --> 02:38:55,670
Patents and another one who I think is 
fucking.

3897
02:38:55,990 --> 02:38:57,430
Yeah,
I think penn is very funny.

3898
02:38:57,431 --> 02:38:57,830
I,
you know,

3899
02:38:57,831 --> 02:39:02,831
I have this whole thing about 
alternative comedy and I find it very 

3900
02:39:02,831 --> 02:39:06,511
funny because like the,
almost like the mount rushmore of 

3901
02:39:06,511 --> 02:39:07,150
alternative comedy,
which is like,

3902
02:39:07,310 --> 02:39:09,850
you know,
pat and sarah silverman,

3903
02:39:10,180 --> 02:39:15,180
I'm David Cross and zach alpha nag.
It's like they're funny people.

3904
02:39:15,701 --> 02:39:17,110
They have set up,
they have punchline.

3905
02:39:17,460 --> 02:39:18,960
There is no alternative to it.

3906
02:39:20,190 --> 02:39:22,350
The exact same conversation yesterday 
for a long time.

3907
02:39:22,351 --> 02:39:27,351
Like what is alternative comedy?
How are these mainstream comedians talk 

3908
02:39:27,351 --> 02:39:29,330
about mainstream subjects and they do 
stand up comedy form.

3909
02:39:29,340 --> 02:39:30,520
How is that alternative?
Like it's,

3910
02:39:30,690 --> 02:39:33,000
it's so hard to define what alternative 
comedy is.

3911
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:35,600
I just think it's,
as far as I can tell,

3912
02:39:35,601 --> 02:39:38,690
it's a look now.
It's like you have all five.

3913
02:39:38,691 --> 02:39:41,210
Look,
I don't because like I did the vancouver

3914
02:39:41,211 --> 02:39:44,150
comedy festival with the vivid video 
comedy tour.

3915
02:39:44,151 --> 02:39:49,151
It was me two porn stars and nerds.
It was all nerds and I would watch like 

3916
02:39:49,730 --> 02:39:53,120
their sets and they talk about this shit
I've heard everybody talk about,

3917
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:55,970
but they did it with glasses on and 
reading off a notebook.

3918
02:39:56,210 --> 02:40:00,470
It's like the closest thing to 
alternative comedy might be a.

3919
02:40:00,890 --> 02:40:03,590
Is it tim and eric's great show,
good jobs.

3920
02:40:03,770 --> 02:40:08,770
Those guys are brilliant,
but they're not going for your normal 

3921
02:40:08,770 --> 02:40:08,770
like setup,
punch.

3922
02:40:08,770 --> 02:40:13,570
ThAt might be alternative kaufman this 
like they're brilliant to.

3923
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:15,960
Have you ever seen that video?
they did with that.

3924
02:40:15,961 --> 02:40:18,300
I don't even know lord dale.
Did you ever see that one?

3925
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:19,840
No.
That's the greatest one of all time.

3926
02:40:19,860 --> 02:40:24,860
That where the grinding and choking they
fuck and it's all psychedelic and crazy 

3927
02:40:24,860 --> 02:40:26,130
neon jumping in fucking dude.
It's amazing.

3928
02:40:26,131 --> 02:40:27,090
humbling,
humbling,

3929
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:29,970
humbling.
That's like real alternative comedy.

3930
02:40:29,971 --> 02:40:32,190
I completely agree with you.
The rest of it is just like.

3931
02:40:32,550 --> 02:40:33,210
It's like,
come on,

3932
02:40:33,211 --> 02:40:33,620
man,
you're.

3933
02:40:33,621 --> 02:40:35,520
You're onstage with notes and that makes
it alternative.

3934
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:40,760
What they've done is they've created an 
environment where they can go with w 

3935
02:40:40,760 --> 02:40:42,900
zero performance.
Yes,

3936
02:40:43,260 --> 02:40:45,420
on purpose and they don't like people to
perform,

3937
02:40:45,421 --> 02:40:47,790
which is understandable.
Some people like soft music,

3938
02:40:47,791 --> 02:40:49,050
you know,
some people like real calm,

3939
02:40:49,051 --> 02:40:50,970
soft music,
people like metal,

3940
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:51,900
you know,
it's all.

3941
02:40:51,901 --> 02:40:54,180
It's all a choice issue.
I like all sorts.

3942
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:56,610
like I like jeff foxworthy,
mankato crazy,

3943
02:40:56,611 --> 02:40:56,950
but I think.

3944
02:40:57,060 --> 02:40:59,160
I think he's funny.
Dude is funny bro.

3945
02:40:59,161 --> 02:40:59,710
Yes,
I think so.

3946
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:05,000
I could dig alan degeneracy man back in 
the day watching her specialty cable 

3947
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:05,190
guy.
He's got some great fucking jokes.

3948
02:41:05,430 --> 02:41:10,430
I like a wide range of stuff.
Some people get very particular about 

3949
02:41:10,430 --> 02:41:10,920
the comedy music,
about comedy,

3950
02:41:10,921 --> 02:41:12,240
about literature,
about everything.

3951
02:41:12,570 --> 02:41:15,030
You know,
it's a lot of shit to enjoy,

3952
02:41:15,031 --> 02:41:15,990
man.
It doesn't.

3953
02:41:16,010 --> 02:41:18,540
It doesn't have to be exactly your speed
for you to enjoy it.

3954
02:41:18,541 --> 02:41:23,541
There's a lot of shit that's good that 
doesn't necessarily resonate with how 

3955
02:41:23,541 --> 02:41:24,060
you would do it,
but still I enjoy it.

3956
02:41:24,450 --> 02:41:26,880
The only people that drive me crazy are 
the clean nazis.

3957
02:41:27,350 --> 02:41:30,330
Especially if they're like the filthiest
people offstage.

3958
02:41:30,390 --> 02:41:32,400
Yes.
You're making a business decision.

3959
02:41:32,401 --> 02:41:34,170
that's fine.
You make that decision,

3960
02:41:34,171 --> 02:41:36,270
But don't get mad at me because I'm me 
on stage.

3961
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:38,520
I'm just.
It's amplified,

3962
02:41:38,521 --> 02:41:39,700
but still mia.

3963
02:41:39,860 --> 02:41:40,890
Yeah,
I get that a lot.

3964
02:41:40,891 --> 02:41:41,340
They like,
yeah,

3965
02:41:41,341 --> 02:41:43,140
they get upset at you because.
Oh yeah.

3966
02:41:43,150 --> 02:41:45,060
Talk about silicon cock.
Too much hate douche bag.

3967
02:41:45,061 --> 02:41:46,140
I think about that.
All right.

3968
02:41:46,170 --> 02:41:47,340
I'm going to talk about whatever I want 
to.

3969
02:41:47,490 --> 02:41:49,260
You talk about whatever you want to.
Don't worry about me.

3970
02:41:49,640 --> 02:41:54,640
lee.
Funny idea that there's something bad 

3971
02:41:54,640 --> 02:41:54,640
about swear words.
It's so juvenile.

3972
02:41:54,640 --> 02:41:59,420
All words are artificial.
We make words to two so we can relay 

3973
02:41:59,420 --> 02:42:02,901
what we're seeing and there's all sorts 
of adjectives that are just as 

3974
02:42:02,901 --> 02:42:03,270
ridiculous.
Like the idea that freakin is okay.

3975
02:42:03,271 --> 02:42:08,271
Like creek clean people say freaking 
this freaking guy and they feel clean 

3976
02:42:08,271 --> 02:42:12,231
and free of any wrongdoing,
but if you say fucking with the same 

3977
02:42:12,231 --> 02:42:13,770
story like seminar that you screwing up,
that's so weird.

3978
02:42:13,771 --> 02:42:16,140
Right?
And if you look in like music,

3979
02:42:16,141 --> 02:42:21,141
movies,
everything else is so dirty now and now 

3980
02:42:21,141 --> 02:42:21,840
like there's very little clean comedy 
left though.

3981
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:23,610
That's not,
that's not very common anymore.

3982
02:42:23,670 --> 02:42:28,670
There's the christian base as funny 
people of faith was a tour that was 

3983
02:42:28,670 --> 02:42:28,870
going on through the,
uh,

3984
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:31,440
through the improv chains and it was at 
the,

3985
02:42:31,441 --> 02:42:36,441
uh,
Arizona improv comedy based on the bible

3986
02:42:36,541 --> 02:42:39,360
and she does like arenas.
Oh,

3987
02:42:39,361 --> 02:42:40,460
that's hilarious.
Yeah,

3988
02:42:40,470 --> 02:42:44,070
I've seen guys do that too.
There was a guy named brad stein who was

3989
02:42:44,430 --> 02:42:47,460
really not very funny in my opinion,
back in the day.

3990
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:50,460
He just was real hacky and just gross.
Well,

3991
02:42:50,461 --> 02:42:55,461
he became this like really right wing 
christian comic and just started 

3992
02:42:55,461 --> 02:42:58,860
crushing and like selling out giant 
places and some books and I got a cd.

3993
02:42:58,861 --> 02:43:01,620
I bought it at a used record store just 
because I was curious.

3994
02:43:01,950 --> 02:43:04,800
It was one of the strangest cds I've 
ever heard in my life.

3995
02:43:04,860 --> 02:43:09,090
Completely devoid of like humor,
but just like weird cheerleading,

3996
02:43:09,091 --> 02:43:12,000
right wing god fearing cheerleading.
Like

3997
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:17,040
it was so bizarre.
But I always laugh at those people 

3998
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:20,011
because eventually they be,
they're human and it catches up with 

3999
02:43:20,011 --> 02:43:23,920
them while they start banging chicks and
ted haggard.

4000
02:43:23,940 --> 02:43:25,220
Yeah,
yeah,

4001
02:43:25,490 --> 02:43:26,260
yeah.
Who's that?

4002
02:43:26,261 --> 02:43:29,350
who's that one priest right now that's 
from a.

4003
02:43:29,560 --> 02:43:33,340
He's in houston.
He talked like this and he's like,

4004
02:43:33,560 --> 02:43:36,670
he plays like a stadium is churches like
a stadium?

4005
02:43:36,700 --> 02:43:41,700
They have a lot of those in Texas.
Bands believe in everybody and it's 

4006
02:43:41,700 --> 02:43:41,700
like,
dude,

4007
02:43:41,700 --> 02:43:42,640
I'm like,
I look in his eyes.

4008
02:43:42,641 --> 02:43:44,470
I go,
that guy seen darkness.

4009
02:43:45,100 --> 02:43:48,580
He's selling something,
but there are some darkness lurking,

4010
02:43:48,581 --> 02:43:53,581
bro.
Ted haggard pulled it off for a long 

4011
02:43:53,581 --> 02:43:55,381
time before he got busted.
Who knows how many guys are out there 

4012
02:43:55,381 --> 02:43:55,381
that are going to get caught that george
records.

4013
02:43:55,381 --> 02:43:56,440
God,
that was the head of the christian ride.

4014
02:43:56,441 --> 02:43:59,370
He was a right almost.
Yep.

4015
02:44:00,010 --> 02:44:02,410
Joel olsteen dude,
that guy and I hear he's a nice guy,

4016
02:44:02,411 --> 02:44:04,600
but through there's darkness lurking,
bro.

4017
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:07,750
My tivo records that guy every week and 
have no idea why.

4018
02:44:07,751 --> 02:44:12,751
I just started recording it,
so I'll sit in bed and just watch it 

4019
02:44:12,751 --> 02:44:14,020
sometimes just out of curiosity and 
that's it shits creepy.

4020
02:44:14,570 --> 02:44:19,570
The lord.
Your life son need to load in your life 

4021
02:44:19,570 --> 02:44:19,570
and his wife's got that big hair and big
makeup.

4022
02:44:19,630 --> 02:44:20,590
Crazy shit,
man.

4023
02:44:20,650 --> 02:44:23,200
It's so interesting because they got 
that crazy politics,

4024
02:44:23,201 --> 02:44:25,900
but they're the funnest people.
The party with the best

4025
02:44:27,080 --> 02:44:28,670
drinking,
drinking in dallas,

4026
02:44:28,940 --> 02:44:30,170
drinking in austin.
True.

4027
02:44:30,190 --> 02:44:32,840
You can find some great drink and 
partners in austin and have some fucking

4028
02:44:32,841 --> 02:44:33,170
fun.

4029
02:44:33,330 --> 02:44:34,110
Yeah,
man.

4030
02:44:34,160 --> 02:44:35,840
let that pot's illegal.
Man.

4031
02:44:35,850 --> 02:44:37,830
You get fucking thrown in jail for pot 
there.

4032
02:44:37,831 --> 02:44:39,350
It's so stupid.
It's a.

4033
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:41,520
They got to fix that.
It's Texas.

4034
02:44:41,730 --> 02:44:45,300
Texas should be sucking the fucking 
corporate dick of America like that.

4035
02:44:45,510 --> 02:44:48,240
Texas is supposed to be the only place 
that can like.

4036
02:44:48,420 --> 02:44:53,420
Isn't this supposed to be legally able 
to secede from the union because it's a 

4037
02:44:53,420 --> 02:44:56,001
republic of taxes or something crazy 
like really religious and and big 

4038
02:44:57,181 --> 02:44:59,580
business go hand in hand.
You know what I'm saying?

4039
02:44:59,581 --> 02:45:00,720
Well,
I do know,

4040
02:45:00,760 --> 02:45:02,640
but it's so funny that people,
reagan,

4041
02:45:02,641 --> 02:45:03,480
reagan in the eighties

4042
02:45:03,710 --> 02:45:07,730
did everything wholesome to religion and
you know the whole right wing religion,

4043
02:45:07,890 --> 02:45:12,890
christian,
christian movement really got involved 

4044
02:45:12,890 --> 02:45:15,011
in politics during the reagan era.
they realized they could tap into those 

4045
02:45:15,011 --> 02:45:15,140
dummies and start selling them shit.
Selling them god,

4046
02:45:15,170 --> 02:45:16,160
god,
guns and country.

4047
02:45:16,161 --> 02:45:18,620
And I just pushed it and ran with it.
It's so amazing.

4048
02:45:18,621 --> 02:45:20,420
It's amazing.
It's amazing because they are the people

4049
02:45:20,421 --> 02:45:22,430
that give the fuck the least about the 
common man.

4050
02:45:22,700 --> 02:45:26,060
You know corporations over the last 
terminators.

4051
02:45:26,150 --> 02:45:28,230
did they really are?
Man.

4052
02:45:28,231 --> 02:45:29,940
They have.
They do not care.

4053
02:45:30,280 --> 02:45:31,800
My attempt trIply.
This is an epic

4054
02:45:32,010 --> 02:45:34,050
long show.
This is the longest show we've ever done

4055
02:45:34,051 --> 02:45:34,940
here.
We do.

4056
02:45:34,960 --> 02:45:36,640
We did.
Do we know what?

4057
02:45:36,700 --> 02:45:41,700
We were ready to wrap it up too,
but we got reinvigorated talking about 

4058
02:45:41,700 --> 02:45:44,451
standup comedy and the comedy store and 
that's one of the things I love about 

4059
02:45:44,451 --> 02:45:44,451
you,
sam,

4060
02:45:44,451 --> 02:45:44,500
tripoli,
you,

4061
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:47,730
you're a real fierce fucking comedian.
You're the real deal.

4062
02:45:47,731 --> 02:45:50,340
You're out there really doing it under 
patrick swayze.

4063
02:45:51,050 --> 02:45:52,590
There's a lot of dudes who,
you know,

4064
02:45:52,620 --> 02:45:57,620
they could be stand up comedians or 
they'd be fucking insurance salesmen or 

4065
02:45:57,620 --> 02:45:58,920
whatever.
You're a fucking standup comic.

4066
02:45:58,921 --> 02:46:00,210
You know,
you're the real deal.

4067
02:46:00,530 --> 02:46:02,210
thanks man.
It's always an honor.

4068
02:46:02,211 --> 02:46:03,950
The crops.
My brother hang out with you too,

4069
02:46:03,951 --> 02:46:04,680

You too.

4070
02:46:04,681 --> 02:46:08,330
My favorite people and always loved 
going on the road with you,

4071
02:46:08,331 --> 02:46:08,840
man.
Yeah,

4072
02:46:08,841 --> 02:46:10,190
well gonna,
tear it up again.

4073
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:11,800
July second.
Ladies and gentlemen,

4077
02:46:24,320 --> 02:46:27,770

improv in hollywood,

4078

4080

4088
02:46:55,031 --> 02:46:55,790
and it means a lot to me and I'm glad 
you love it and we're not going to stop.

4089

So thank you guys.
Take care.
