1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,360
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,940
you pull it through as
you push it through.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,340
It's like there's no,

4
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:13,930
there's no banging on my wrist at all.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,200
I don't feel anything on my right one,

6
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:17,920
it's on my left.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,090
It's just a timing thing.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,230
It's like as it's coming up like you'd
get into here and then all in one motion.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,240
You should it like this where your hand
quote meaning you're doing swing swings

10
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:29,074
is a different thing.

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,423
Yeah.

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,221
If you want to do,

13
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:41,270
when you're doing two
hand cleans up twice.

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,820
If you go on to him cleans,

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,250
you'd have one in each arm and you go
like this like that you recommended?

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:47,981
I do.

17
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,700
The ones I like,

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,420
I like to him to this,

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,080
it makes me work both sides the same,

20
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:55,914
what's it called?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,570
It's called project tango and it's been
out for a little while but they made

22
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:03,710
some adjustments for the sake of io
and it's a a tablet if it looks like a

23
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:04,370
regular tablet,

24
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,510
but what it actually has the ability to
do is to map three d space in real time.

25
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,030
So if you think of like VR generally
you put on a Vr headset and you're in

26
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:15,650
whatever university
they want to put you in.

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,770
This one is looking at the actual thing.

28
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:21,920
So interacting with objects is something
you can still do even though you're

29
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:23,780
looking at a digital representation of it.

30
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,023
You know what I'm saying?

31
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:25,760
Sounds,

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,301
sounds weird,

33
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:27,350
but like a couch,

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,581
it's still a couch.

35
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:29,120
So you could,

36
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,750
you could like almost stylize it and
say you can put like an alligator on the

37
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:33,650
couch next to you,

38
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:34,341
for example,

39
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:38,930
like a completely active scenario
that you can interact with physically.

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,240
And on top of that they have,

41
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:42,074
um,

42
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,770
the other use case scenario that I
think they're talking about is like in

43
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:46,850
mapping projects,

44
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,860
mapping internal spaces
and things like that.

45
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:50,690
But it's in a developer mode right now.

46
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,150
So you can either hold it
up and do it like that.

47
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:53,930
Uh,

48
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,381
normally.

49
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,570
And they also build like a actual
physical headset for would be wicked for

50
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,650
greenscreen gps where you could
actually have gps and going in between.

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,100
But the,

52
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,641
the main,

53
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,330
uh,

54
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,600
one of the main propositions just for
robotics because right now robots don't

55
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:13,601
see very well and this would essentially
give robots the ability to see time and

56
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:15,104
space similar.

57
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,490
Shoot the whole

58
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,700
thing off the host talking about 280

59
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,153
blower.

60
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,640
It's small.

61
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,990
It's a tight arrow.

62
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,530
That's her small

63
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,470
aluminum and carbon.

64
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,660
I thought you like the iPhone.

65
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,383
Awesome.

66
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,570
Wow.

67
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:46,990
Yeah,

68
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,823
it

69
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,420
will be old one.

70
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,283
It fits.

71
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,793
Ooh,

72
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,660
that's,

73
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,470
that's clean.

74
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,303
That was all right.

75
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,530
I hit a nice sweet spot.

76
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,440
I have this awesome
background on the gang green.

77
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,760
Yeah,

78
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,400
that's on target and I'm all set.

79
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,903
That's on target.

80
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,140
It's just a matter of
these things when we don't,

81
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:15,380
but we'll book.

82
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:26,890
That's good.

83
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,940
Cut it

84
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,920
sharp or is it like a point?

85
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,731
There's a point.

86
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:33,911
Yeah.

87
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:34,744
It's definitely a point.

88
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,000
Do we want to try and get this done?

89
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:37,350
We need to do,

90
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,550
I should

91
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,343
bring it up here.

92
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,591
Bring Nafa said,

93
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:42,710
oh,

94
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,240
get here.

95
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,710
I guess.

96
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:43,931
All right.

97
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:47,650
Here we're going to
need the big boat book.

98
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,980
Said it a little easier to manage a
swap your main just to 10 pounds more

99
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,084
pulling.

100
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,040
No,

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,180
it's 100% not necessary and we're
actually going to shoot those thing.

102
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:03,220
I'll explain what this
is and what of those and

103
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,900
yeah,

104
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,733
it's a lot like,

105
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,060
oh,

106
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,140
like if you wanted to do this,

107
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,570
if you want to do this experiment,

108
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:14,404
this is,

109
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:17,850
no,

110
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,683
this is,

111
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,570
if not,

112
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:26,020
you know the other one that I to is
the most powerful compound bullet point

113
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:27,940
stuff.

114
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,710
You have to order it
special from the factory.

115
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,620
Like you can't even
buy this from the most.

116
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,830
You can buy a running count
along from a low score,

117
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:37,540
but there will be more on like this

118
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,140
is a special order.

119
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,273
The 90 [inaudible],

120
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,203
the other one

121
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,100
got called at nine.

122
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,030
It's called point factor to 90 pounds.

123
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:50,864
Draw weight.

124
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,100
It shoots 490 green arrows.

125
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,700
288 is one of the most
powerful pose known to man.

126
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,530
It's like you could conceivably
make something that's more powerful.

127
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:10,720
Like I've heard of a hundred
pound bows but very few companies.

128
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,303
Or is this data?

129
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,160
This is all about the distance.

130
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,971
This is all,

131
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:16,600
um,

132
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,940
this one doesn't have a sight tape on it.

133
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,130
If you look at this one,

134
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,650
see site

135
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,353
a little more.

136
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,973
Last lap,

137
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,080
the CEPHEID.

138
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,693
Oh,

139
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,190
smell the burn.

140
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,710
It's barbecue barbecue.

141
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,180
It'd be smelly arrowhead springs.

142
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:10,014
She's scholastic.

143
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,641
Oh Shit.

144
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:11,240
Yeah.

145
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,870
Yeah.

146
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,860
That's fresh smelling.

147
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:17,861
Burning plastics by aluminum
and it's very smallest diameter,

148
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,740
but very heavy in weight and because of
that it penetrates deep into the target.

149
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,040
Do Lowe's through phones.

150
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,380
It's,

151
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,223
that's right.

152
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,520
Can you get that on Amazon prime?

153
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,354
Right

154
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,570
excessively went through my pops.

155
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,413
I mean,

156
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:41,960
rolling.

157
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,750
You're rolling on that one.

158
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,011
Rolling.

159
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:43,910
Right now there's a little price,

160
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:45,620
so it's time to do the real deal.

161
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:47,350
Now we have the Sapphire glass.

162
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:50,330
We're going to a teeth bay
over top of the target.

163
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,393
You

164
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,503
Bullseye.

165
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,170
Bulls-Eye.

166
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,003
Kapow.

167
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,933
There we go.

168
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:03,651
This one,

169
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:05,420
it was scared of flip back.

170
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,200
The only thing I'm worried about is you
guys the dark glasses on nominate depth

171
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:10,610
behind it.

172
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,180
Okay.

173
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,630
Yeah,

174
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:11,961
I think.

175
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:12,141
Yeah,

176
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:12,601
exactly.

177
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:13,434
You finished chatter.

178
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:13,940
You,

179
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,220
here's what they can
somebody get a sip thumbnail.

180
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,540
You need to just that.

181
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,050
Oh,

182
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,870
right over top.

183
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,703
The

184
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,100
right there.

185
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,273
Excuse me.

186
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,273
Yeah.

187
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,973
You know what I'm saying,

188
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,493
dude?

189
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,280
Okay.

190
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,560
Yeah.

191
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,131
I'm going to say,

192
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:31,431
okay.

193
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:35,150
I'm at full draw and then you hit the
button and then I'm going to wait three

194
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:35,730
and shoot.

195
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,070
Is it boys right now?

196
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,761
I think when we,

197
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:39,830
I had one in one shot.

198
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:40,581
All right,

199
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:41,300
here's full dry.

200
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,530
Are we going to have
more than one shot at it?

201
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:43,230
What are you talking about?

202
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,063
US.

203
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,231
All right,

204
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,160
go ahead and anytime you're ready.

205
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,203
Go.

206
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,890
Definitely that didn't work.

207
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,253
Yes sir.

208
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,873
That's the one

209
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,153
right there

210
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,823
by the table

211
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,580
in a pretty good accuracy and needs

212
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,193
further fruit.

213
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,173
The next phone,

214
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,180
iPhone still be shit
out here in the range.

215
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,700
Next came the real world

216
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,380
to love as well.

217
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,303
Oh

218
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,510
now it's time to show
Samsung some love as well.

219
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:40,130
We get John from Tlv and you said
you're not a partial only that let,

220
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
we got to spread the love
and why are we doing that?

221
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,230
Oversight and Terry as chair,

222
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,641
we need,

223
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:51,641
we need t shirts that say for
science this flavor but chuck taping.

224
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,763
Yeah,

225
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,283
you guys could just,

226
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,560
you know what you should do?

227
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,890
You should try to have that video going.

228
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,300
If that phone works,

229
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,220
have a video going of the Arrow coming
out and just blackness or quick,

230
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,123
wow,

231
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,833
that's pretty cool

232
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,663
right now.

233
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,450
It is my glow.

234
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:32,721
You know what?

235
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:33,810
I might go that sizzling.

236
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,683
Right?

237
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,503
So

238
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,273
we should again,

239
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,423
probably

240
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,783
600

241
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,133
military

242
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,260
more comparative

243
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,350
screen than the Hundred
Years War shooting.

244
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:55,310
When you see it go.

245
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,431
All right,

246
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:57,264
we're ready.

247
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,183
Let's do it.

248
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,540
Full drill,

249
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,863
baby

250
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,150
drill

251
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,913
a little

252
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,083
better than that.

253
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,850
I would say it held up a little better.

254
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,090
That's

255
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,423
it.

256
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,070
[inaudible].
