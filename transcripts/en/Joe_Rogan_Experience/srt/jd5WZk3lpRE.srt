1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,750
The joe rogan experience you are,

2
00:00:02,751 --> 00:00:05,000
you were in space for 166 days.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,511
Amazing.

4
00:00:05,511 --> 00:00:06,080
Huh?

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,920
That's insane.

6
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,400
It's,

7
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,200
it's when I sit on my dark and
watch the space station go over,

8
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:12,800
uh,

9
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,980
it's really hard to rationalize cause
I know I was up here and I can remember

10
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:16,611
all the details,

11
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:19,220
but to try and link in life on earth with,

12
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,250
with seeing that spotlight
go across the horizon,

13
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:22,381
it's,

14
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:22,971
it's still,

15
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:24,860
I haven't got sorted out of
my head how to connect it.

16
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,290
Is that the longest a
person's ever been up there?

17
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:27,530
No,

18
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:27,810
we,

19
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,581
there was a Russian guy,

20
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:31,160
didn't Valarie Poliakoff a
state of 14 months straight.

21
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,850
400 and whatever that is days.

22
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:33,500
Long time.

23
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,220
Wow.

24
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:34,600
Yeah.

25
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:34,850
No,

26
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,440
I'm nowhere near the record.

27
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,690
That's in the still in 166 days is an
incredible amount of time to be detached

28
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:44,540
from gravity and floating around in space.

29
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,760
What is the effect on your body?

30
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,770
A big effects short term,

31
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,341
huge.

32
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,580
Your body doesn't have to lift the blood
up to your head when you're weightless.

33
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:53,821
Right?

34
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,190
So your whole cardiovascular
system changes.

35
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:59,850
All the nice little mechanisms
that squeeze the balloon,

36
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,860
that is your body to get
the blood up to your head.

37
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,941
They stop working,

38
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:03,990
your heart gets smaller.

39
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,560
Uh,

40
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,970
you start losing your skeleton.

41
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,903
Um,

42
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,450
your balanced system
completely shuts down.

43
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,290
I mean,

44
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,450
it has no stimulus from gravity anymore.

45
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:14,190
So you become totally visually based.

46
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,840
So when you come home,

47
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,010
it's brutal.

48
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,780
Building all those things back up again.

49
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,740
Um,

50
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,420
and most of them you feel,

51
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,051
I mean,

52
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:23,730
you lose the callouses on
the bottom of your feet.

53
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,460
It's kind of disgusting because you're
sure your feet are like a snake up there.

54
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:29,880
Over the bottom of your feet are shedding
cause you never used the bottom of

55
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,940
your feet and you build up calluses on
the top because you're always tucking

56
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,040
your feet underneath things.

57
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,420
So when you come back,

58
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:39,060
you've even have to grow the callousness
back in the bottom of your feet.

59
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,760
And the thing that takes the
longest is your skeleton.

60
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,241
Um,

61
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:45,420
I lost about 8% of the bone
across my hips and butt.

62
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:46,254
It's gone back.

63
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,621
And,

64
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:46,800
uh,

65
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,320
within about a year of landing all,

66
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:48,660
uh,

67
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,030
hopefully be back to normal one year.

68
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,160
It takes one year for your
body to fully recover.

69
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,610
It took about four months before I could
run normally again where my body would

70
00:01:56,611 --> 00:02:01,230
get the blood out of my feet and pump it
properly back up to my head about four

71
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:01,501
months,

72
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,480
which is almost as long
as I was up in this trip.

73
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,261
But yeah,

74
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:05,400
the bone takes the longest,

75
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,720
but it's uh,

76
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,800
it's automatic,

77
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,663
which is interesting.

78
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,670
My body got osteoporosis and it's
reversing osteoporosis using some internal

79
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,920
stimulus that we don't even understand.

80
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:20,250
So it makes a pretty good
medical study for everybody.

81
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,380
200 years ago,

82
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,020
it was so long ago when you think of like,

83
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:27,620
if you had to go back in time and
live like people live 200 years ago,

84
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,450
it would suck a fat one.

85
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,700
It wouldn't even be a little fun.

86
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,810
Everybody would die.

87
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,370
Every time the flu comes into town,

88
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,890
all your best friends are dead,

89
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,213
dead.

90
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,220
You don't live if you
get an infection dead,

91
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,560
you just got to survive at that point.

92
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,970
200 years later,

93
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,530
we're talking about 200 years from now
where there's robots that you literally

94
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:49,980
can't tell if it's a person or a robot.

95
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:50,121
Right?

96
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:50,721
For sure.

97
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:51,150
Right.

98
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,390
100% and no wrinkles.

99
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,410
I think they're already here.

100
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,840
Do you think the robot prostitutes
will be the first market?

101
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,733
Oh yeah,

102
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,470
probably right.

103
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,100
Violence or how much?

104
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,180
How much blow back do you think there'll
be with robot prostitutes if women,

105
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,690
you know,

106
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,820
what will women like
draw a line in the sand?

107
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,040
That fucking robot is a cheating thing.

108
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,780
So back to what you were saying.

109
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:11,180
So,

110
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,210
so something is ugly as like

111
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,480
they would still get mad
if we had sex with it.

112
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,411
Yeah,

113
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:18,244
that's what I'm saying.

114
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,240
If he gets to like,

115
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,220
if it looks like a fake thing,

116
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,580
women probably,

117
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:24,370
it would be like treat
it like a fleshlight.

118
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,120
Right.

119
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,640
But as it gets closer and
closer to a real person,

120
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,380
like if it looks like Robby,

121
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:30,910
the robot from lost in space,

122
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,780
danger,

123
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,640
danger,

124
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,670
he could stick your Dick in that.

125
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,600
No one's going to say anything.

126
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,900
What would they let you print
out a face of her though?

127
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,910
Like so if it looks just like your wife,

128
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,270
yeah,

129
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,780
but then you'd be that,

130
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,660
why would you want to come home or
faces carving seven inches of calm?

131
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,190
You never clean it.

132
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,480
You just keep shooting on her face.

133
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,291
And she's like,

134
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:47,641
what are you doing?

135
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:48,520
You're trying to drown me.

136
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,080
Is this like some passive aggressive shit,

137
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,530
right?

138
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,110
Or you're drowning income or you're
married to your Burnett and you come home

139
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:54,120
and the robot's blonde.

140
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,430
Yeah.

141
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,960
And that's what she just
freaks the fuck out.

142
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,560
You come home,

143
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,840
you're putting black face on your role,

144
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,460
your wife.

145
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,293
He's like,

146
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,163
fuck.

147
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,580
I think distract.

148
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,400
The problem that people have with,

149
00:04:05,401 --> 00:04:05,890
uh,

150
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,970
being informed over being distracted is
that it's incredibly frustrating and you

151
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:13,300
feel helpless when you start reading
all these stories about the stock market

152
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:18,301
manipulations about the banks being
bailed out and about bail outs where the

153
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,540
fucking people that were involved in the
bail out somehow or another warranted

154
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,100
some crazy commission.

155
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,660
They got some bonus of the gut and then
the president is going to limit to a

156
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:28,661
half a million dollars,

157
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,430
like a fucking half a million
dollars is a lot of money,

158
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:30,790
man.

159
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,350
What do you mean you're
limiting it to a half a month?

160
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,030
Didn't we just give them a ton of money?

161
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,210
Yeah.

162
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,810
You feel helpless when you read about
this shit over and over and over again.

163
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,300
When you watch documentaries on fracking,

164
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:40,990
when you,

165
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,291
you know,

166
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,860
you read stories in the news about how,

167
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:47,830
how poorly veterans are being taken
care of when they come back from war and

168
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,400
there's so many different things that
you read where that doesn't make sense.

169
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:51,921
I know,

170
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:55,100
but when you look at all
of these new stories,

171
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:58,640
there's always one underlying
issue in every news story.

172
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:03,641
It's kind of amazing and it always
goes back to who is funding these

173
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:04,760
politicians,

174
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,420
right?

175
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,190
If you get the money out of politics,

176
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,060
that virus,

177
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:09,920
if you destroy that virus,

178
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,540
things will change quickly because our
representatives will be forced to pay

179
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,770
attention to the American people,

180
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:18,800
the people that are voting for them as
opposed to the people who are paying

181
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:19,490
them.

182
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:19,761
You know,

183
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:23,330
if you get rid of that type of bribery
that we're dealing with right now,

184
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,210
the entire system needs to be changed

185
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,560
unquestionably.

186
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,880
But how does that ever happen?

187
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,211
I mean,

188
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:30,560
it doesn't mean we eat.

189
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:33,830
You have to like get them to
change it themselves as well.

190
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,420
How else is it going to get changed?

191
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,700
Well,

192
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,533
here's the thing.

193
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,020
Um,

194
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,240
Congress is obviously very corrupt.

195
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,133
So Congress,

196
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,720
this is congress of America.

197
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,950
They're obviously very much bought
by corporations and as a result,

198
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:51,660
it's really difficult for them
to propose any real change.

199
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,580
But when it comes to the state level,

200
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:55,020
when it comes to state legislators,

201
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,890
it's a little different.

202
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,130
So we actually to get,

203
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,210
I'm a state representative from Texas
to propose a regular resolution for a

204
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,380
constitutional convention.

205
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:05,870
And it goes back to what I was
saying earlier about wolf pack.

206
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,700
And if we get,

207
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,091
you know,

208
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:12,080
state state representatives from all the
states to agree to this constitutional

209
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:12,914
convention,

210
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,790
then we can actually
have this constitutional
amendment to get money out of

211
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,300
politics.

212
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,620
It's possible.

213
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,690
We just need to inform people about it.

214
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,520
wolf-pack.com

215
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,950
what is the main stream
explanation for human sacrifice?

216
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:28,620
Like what,

217
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,660
what do they believe started off?

218
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:30,871
Well,

219
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:35,871
that it's that it's a feeding of
psychic energy to supernatural beings.

220
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,260
That's what human sacrifices about that,

221
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:42,390
that that you take the psychic
energy of the individual,

222
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:43,410
you're going to kill you,

223
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,273
kill them,

224
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,720
take their psychic energy and feed it
to these vampire like creatures that are

225
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:50,240
lying in the beyond that,

226
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,250
that thrive on human misery and pain.

227
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,421
And you know,

228
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:56,850
who are we to say that
such things do not exist?

229
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,890
We don't understand the nature of reality.

230
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,540
I don't go with you on that,

231
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,920
but I do in a way.

232
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,320
I don't believe in demons,

233
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,191
but I do.

234
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:10,191
I think it's undeniable that there have
been massive groups of people that have

235
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:12,990
participated in horrific things.

236
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,370
So what is that,

237
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,020
if not demonic?

238
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,800
I believe it's,

239
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,670
I believe it's demonic.

240
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,870
I can't prove it.

241
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,790
I can't prove that that's the case.

242
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:24,780
I just think we should stay open to that
possibility that the nature of reality

243
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:29,340
is so complex and so multilayered that
there may be much more going on than we

244
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:30,600
think and that if we just,

245
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,010
if we just confine our explanations of
things to purely economic and material

246
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:35,431
terms,

247
00:07:35,431 --> 00:07:40,431
we may be missing part of the picture
and that when the ancient spoke of angels

248
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:41,580
and demons to use words,

249
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:44,280
I'm not saying that I believe
in angels or demons as such,

250
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:47,010
but when they spoke of
Lawton light and dark forces,

251
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,100
negative and positive
forces playing on the,

252
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:50,851
on the human race,

253
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:52,200
maybe they had something going.

254
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,430
Maybe there was something to that.

255
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:53,650
Well,

256
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,300
I always consider the fact that human
beings have this incredibly broad spectrum

257
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,350
of possibility.

258
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,520
It's incredibly broad spectrum of
behavior and personality of circumstance,

259
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:05,940
of genetics and that there's
this Yin and Yang of life.

260
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,940
There's this pull and push of life and
that the extreme ends of it are good and

261
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:11,370
evil,

262
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,170
good and evil.

263
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,451
And,

264
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,000
and it's,

265
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,490
it may not be a demon,

266
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:17,880
but it might as well be a demon if you're
marching 80,000 people off the side of

267
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:20,460
a pyramid and cutting their heart
out with a fucking stone tool.

268
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,210
Yeah.

269
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:21,960
That's demonic.

270
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,850
It might as well being,

271
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,880
might as well be a demon.

272
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,271
Yeah.

273
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:24,511
And,

274
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:24,820
and,

275
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,800
and that is a,

276
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:26,820
that is worth considering.

277
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:27,101
And the A,

278
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:28,050
and the question is what is,

279
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:28,620
you know,

280
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,550
what is going on here?

281
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:34,551
I have a very dear friend called James
Tiburon who refers to this world that we

282
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:39,510
live in as a university of
July polity that we have,

283
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,373
um,

284
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,750
that we have lessons to
learn from Jew oddity,

285
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,630
maybe dualities,

286
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,431
not the whole thing.

287
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:47,130
Maybe there is an overarching
unity and oneness in,

288
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,940
in all things.

289
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,670
But right now here in this
incarnation on planet earth,

290
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,620
we have to learn from duality.

291
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:55,770
And the thing about [inaudible]
is human beings choose.

292
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,850
We can always choose,

293
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:59,730
even in the most straightened
and difficult circumstances,

294
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:02,640
we can always choose for the
light rather than the darkness.

295
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,290
We can always choose for
good rather than evil.

296
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:08,250
We don't have to take that act that
causes pain and suffering to another human

297
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:08,611
being.

298
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:09,900
We never have to do that.

299
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,640
We can always choose not to.

300
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,590
The alarming thing is that people often
will choose the act that causes pain and

301
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:17,490
suffering to others,

302
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,740
and we are defined by our choices,

303
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:22,770
and this is where we need to grow
up as a species and start to choose,

304
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,120
start to choose the light.

305
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,980
Okay.
