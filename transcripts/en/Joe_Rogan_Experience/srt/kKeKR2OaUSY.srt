1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,500
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,340
All he's doing is playing some really
crazy game that was around before he was

3
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:06,174
ever born.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,370
He just got into it and
got really good at it.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:08,790
Yeah.

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,690
The game itself,

7
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:11,010
it's bananas.

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,630
Just the stock market itself.

9
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:15,090
Just the idea that the wealth of,

10
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:15,421
of,

11
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:20,421
of a a person can vary day
by day because of confidence,

12
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:21,660
you know,

13
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,380
confidence,

14
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,190
computer,

15
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,710
consumer confidence in a product can
shift and change with Rico and then you

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,710
watching these numbers go up and down
like what the fuck are you even talking

17
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:32,011
about?

18
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,750
Most of the explanations you see,

19
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:33,961
you know,

20
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:36,570
I watched these business sites in
the market will go down and they say,

21
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,000
oh mark it down because of
such and such in London.

22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,770
And then it's like by the
time that piece comes out,

23
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:43,560
that market's actually back up and
they're already constructing their,

24
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:43,951
you know,

25
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:46,860
let's tie market going back
up to another random feature.

26
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,071
You know,

27
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:47,731
it's like the,

28
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:48,250
the,

29
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,470
the explanations after the fact
have so little to do with whatever.

30
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:56,850
Some algorithm decided it was going to
suddenly ultra fast trade something and,

31
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,140
and throw the stock up.

32
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:58,471
You know,

33
00:00:58,471 --> 00:00:59,670
it's like at this point it's,

34
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,533
it truly is.

35
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,620
That's the best place to see
humans combating machines
is on the marketing where

36
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,140
it's like there's human
traders competing with these,

37
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:10,800
that programmed algorithms and the
algorithms are certainly winning the war.

38
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,080
And if you look at their
screens while they're,

39
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,881
while they're doing it,

40
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:15,330
it is almost like code.

41
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,790
Like the average person
who doesn't understand it,

42
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,980
doesn't know what the fuck
the stock market's saying,

43
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:21,390
the symbols and the essay,

44
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,760
Oh and this and that and
the ones and the Zeros.

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,781
You look at all that,

46
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:25,800
you have no idea what that is.

47
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:25,981
I mean,

48
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:28,440
how has that really different than a
computer code that you're reading me?

49
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,990
That's essentially like a,

50
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:31,290
a way that,

51
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:31,530
uh,

52
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,100
people are,

53
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,301
are,

54
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:32,520
are,

55
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:32,850
are,

56
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,800
are tapping into this bizarre system.

57
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,221
I mean,

58
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:40,110
it was at one time this sort of the
price of something it had to do with some

59
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:40,610
thing,

60
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,000
right?

61
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,060
It's like there's a factory,

62
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:42,241
oh,

63
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:44,150
it's factory went slower
today in the rain.

64
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,420
The market will go down on that.

65
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:46,700
So it was like real,

66
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,100
you know,

67
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,100
and it's gotten certainly further and
further from whatever is going on in that

68
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:54,780
company or their earnings are the things,

69
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,201
you know,

70
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:55,470
it's,

71
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,950
it's absolutely abstracted to the point
now where people don't even invest in

72
00:01:58,951 --> 00:01:59,620
companies.

73
00:01:59,620 --> 00:01:59,930
Right?

74
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,120
Right.

75
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,630
You invest in something like when Facebook
went public and people bought it at

76
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:04,700
like nine in the morning,

77
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,281
like nine,

78
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,570
10 they're all pissed off,

79
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:07,560
but it hasn't gone up.

80
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,251
It's like,

81
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:08,821
wait a minute,

82
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:11,010
I was supposed to triple my,

83
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:11,640
well,

84
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,090
my wealth.

85
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,331
It's like,

86
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:12,451
no,

87
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:13,050
you don't.

88
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,670
You don't make money on the trade.

89
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,620
You're supposed to make
money on when you've,

90
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,311
when you've done it.

91
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:17,941
But you know,

92
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:18,720
now we've got,

93
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:18,921
yeah.

94
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:19,140
You know,

95
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,740
derivatives and derivatives of derivatives
and derivatives of derivatives of

96
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:23,640
derivatives on there,

97
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:28,020
which is just a way of kind of shrinking
the explainer for people don't know

98
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:28,621
what that means.

99
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:30,060
So if you buy a stock,

100
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,331
I mean,

101
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:30,601
you know,

102
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:31,321
you buy stock in you,

103
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:33,270
I hope it goes up and then
you sell it in the future.

104
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,660
If you'd rather make
up that time right now,

105
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,910
I can sell it in the future right now,

106
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:39,510
right?

107
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,140
I can basically sell that future sale
cause I think that sales is going to be a

108
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:44,610
good one now,

109
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,873
right?

110
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,351
I can say,

111
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:47,280
what if I did that trait?

112
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:47,700
I'm to,

113
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,001
I'm going to,

114
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,990
I'm going to have it now,

115
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,123
but

116
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,293
okay,

117
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,880
so what am I trading then I'm trading,

118
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,743
I'm trading on,

119
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,880
on an abstraction from what something's
to be worse at some in the future.

120
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,570
So it's like I'm trading on the stock
over time and then someone else will say,

121
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:04,751
well,

122
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,250
I'm going to trade on
the abstraction of that.

123
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,460
I'm going to trade on whether or not
people think the stock in the future is

124
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:10,930
going to be worth more next minute.

125
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,250
Then this minute it's like,

126
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,330
well what's that?

127
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,750
So basically what you're doing is
you're buying the stock over time,

128
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:17,501
over time,

129
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:18,191
over time,

130
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,000
over time,

131
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,530
you're creating these things,

132
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:24,070
these derivatives of whatever
the original investment was,

133
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,910
which is kind of just a derivative
of the thing because the pork belly,

134
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:29,110
this driven of the pork belly,

135
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:30,100
drifters of the derivatives,

136
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,800
derivatives of the derivatives of the
derivatives and the derivatives all goof

137
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,120
ball ever tighter ways of saying
what is pork belly going to be worth,

138
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,223
you know,

139
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,750
on February 3rd why is that illegal?

140
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,231
Well,

141
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,820
it's legal because what it,

142
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,920
because the economy requires it,

143
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:45,280
right?

144
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,810
We have a kind of money,

145
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,291
right?

146
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,250
That has a clock in it.

147
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,280
It's lent into existence and has to
be paid back more than got lent out.

148
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,740
So our economy needs to
expand by hook or by Crook.

149
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:59,860
Somehow it has to grow in
order for it to survive.

150
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,050
That's just the way
central currency works.

151
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,130
They need to find more
surface area for the money,

152
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,080
more ways for people to buy stuff.

153
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,550
So instead of just having,

154
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,110
there's not enough of a company to buy.

155
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:15,520
So now we can bet on how that company
is going to do in some future gut.

156
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,350
We can bet on that or we can bet on that.

157
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,071
Right.

158
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:22,150
But what we're really doing is trying to
kind of compress all of this time right

159
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:24,820
onto like the head of a
pin so we can bet on that.

160
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,350
So I don't have to sit and wait,

161
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:26,831
you know,

162
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:29,740
3000 years for Facebook
to be worth something.

163
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,320
I can trade on his future worth now.

164
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,380
But the whole joke of that is
people who are trading that way,

165
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:37,480
there are these computers that
are trading faster than them.

166
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,430
So I put in one of my super fast,

167
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:40,150
crazy,

168
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,560
I'm derivative trade.

169
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,490
Goldman Sachs sees that order
coming in on the computer.

170
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,740
They're so close to the exchange,

171
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:52,741
they can execute an order before my order
even goes through based on having seen

172
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:54,340
that I was going to do
what I'm going to do.

173
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,070
So they can literally trade in my future.

174
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,181
Right.

175
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,410
Well I am in their past.

176
00:04:59,620 --> 00:04:59,861
No,

177
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:00,310
that's,

178
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,660
that's digital time shifting.

179
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:02,180
I mean that's,

180
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,640
that sounds like it's cheating.

181
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,570
That's like someone like running a quick
server and they're local and then you

182
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:08,920
have like 150 paying.

183
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,533
Exactly.

184
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,530
That's bullshit.

185
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:12,971
I think so.

186
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:14,250
With the Solo Bullshit.

187
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,270
The irony of it is it's gotten so big,

188
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:16,421
right?

189
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:20,800
Derivative trading is bigger than regular
trading now so that the New York Stock

190
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:23,200
Exchange actually just got bought.

191
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,010
The exchange itself got bought
by its derivative exchange,

192
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,890
so it's almost just like
the proof's in the pudding.

193
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,920
It's like the derivative owns
the market at this point,

194
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,550
but that's when you get that.

195
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:36,870
How,

196
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,670
how could the government even ever
deny how incompetent they are?

197
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,980
Then they allowed that like that alone
to like someone should just like have a

198
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,100
broadcast on national television,

199
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,610
a,

200
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,410
you know one of those town hall sort
of events where you sit down with the,

201
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,520
the main people that
run the country and go,

202
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,140
how the fuck are you allowing this?

203
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,090
How are you,

204
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,070
you not fix this?

205
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,270
Why would you ever try to do
anything else before you fix this?

206
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,220
When they made the decision,

207
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:06,470
they genuinely thought it
would be good for business.

208
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,400
Let it go,

209
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,830
let it in the short term.

210
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,460
I will never understand where it all
close business people promise them,

211
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,220
figure it out before it got really bad.

212
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,083
Oh my God,

213
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,800
we figure it out before it got really bad.

214
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,500
How much bigger is the derivative economy?

215
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,600
I don't know exactly.

216
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:24,434
I mean it seemed,

217
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,200
I was looking trying
to find out what that,

218
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,650
what the sort of trading was.

219
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:32,651
It seemed from what I could tell like
94% of trades are now derivative because

220
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:34,840
they're,

221
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,673
because,

222
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,050
because there's such bigger volumes.

223
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,450
God that's insane.

224
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,100
No one's gonna like
you're not going to buy,

225
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:41,301
you know,

226
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,790
10,000 chairs of Honeywell
today cause that's,

227
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,930
you know,

228
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,351
whatever.

229
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,610
$60,000 or something.

230
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,350
But you could buy like 10,000 futures
on Honeywell cause they're really cheap.

231
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,870
God that is so crazy.

232
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,500
4% of the stuff of trades are,

233
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,270
and how many more is,

234
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,410
I think it's ultra fast
too is a whole other,

235
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,700
there's sort of two different,

236
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,101
two different realms.

237
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:07,461
But yeah,

238
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,294
it's huge.

239
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,800
They must all be crazy.

240
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,250
Everyone involved in that must know
that they're bringing on the matrix.

241
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,900
They must know that they're there.

242
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,810
They're the first steps before
the digital machine takes over.

243
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,853
They must know.

244
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,950
They must know that there's no
humanity in that stock market shit.

245
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:22,940
That's chaos.

246
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,103
And,

247
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,860
and again,

248
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,440
I don't want digital technology
to get blamed for this,

249
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:27,891
right?

250
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:30,080
Because the real operating
system they're promoting,

251
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:32,360
it's not the digital operating system,

252
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,730
it's the economic operating
system underneath it.

253
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:39,650
It's this 13th century central currency
interest bearing debt based economy.

254
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,080
And none of the guys who I
thought would get us out,

255
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:42,410
you know,

256
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,880
ev Williams with Twitter,

257
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,140
Mark Zuckerberg,

258
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:45,974
with Facebook,

259
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,120
the kids from Google,

260
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,690
right?

261
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,530
They're getting the,

262
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,240
each of them had a real shot.

263
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,250
Even Bill Gates at breaking
the central economy and,

264
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,020
and flipping things the other way.

265
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,260
How do you go and do that?

266
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,180
Going public,

267
00:07:59,210 --> 00:07:59,831
not be good,

268
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:02,810
not doing it with venture
capital saying if I can,

269
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,230
if,

270
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,600
if Google can hack web search,

271
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,850
if Facebook can hack social,

272
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,710
if Twitter can hack everybody,

273
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,353
why can't they,

274
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,020
you know,

275
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,050
they're so busy disintermediating
all these different things.

276
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:19,220
Why doesn't anyone of them yet want to
disintermediate central banking and say,

277
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:19,730
no,

278
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,391
Mr. Chase,

279
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:21,560
we don't actually need you.

280
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:23,180
We're going to do our whole
thing through Kickstarter.

281
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:25,310
Say like one of your
didn't want to hear things.

282
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:25,540
Uh,

283
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,373
yeah,

284
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,700
that's an interesting point of view.

285
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:31,970
I think they probably would never want
to take that stand because they would be

286
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:32,804
killed.

287
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,100
I would imagine there's
a lot of money and uh,

288
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,790
and in them not being
successful with that quest,

289
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:41,630
you know,

290
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,840
to control point at which,

291
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:45,021
you know,

292
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:46,010
you're doing paypal,

293
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,311
okay,

294
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:49,760
we're going to let people do
individual transactions that was there,

295
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,640
their original model and they were
going to make money on the float.

296
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,870
And then the banks came to them and said,

297
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,350
uh,

298
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,071
you're not allowed to do that.

299
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:57,510
You're not a bank paypal kids.

300
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,620
You gotta be,

301
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,100
you know,

302
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,950
can I just start as a bank or you're going
to have to be connected to one of us.

303
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,821
And that's when,

304
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:03,121
you know,

305
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:07,110
paypal kind of becomes part of Ebay
rather than whatever these crazy guys

306
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:07,591
might've done.

307
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:09,330
And I suppose there's this point,

308
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,080
you know,

309
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,180
where you know,

310
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,470
innocently these companies that
get bigger and bigger and bigger,

311
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,520
hoping to do the right things,

312
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,354
and then it's like,

313
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,480
we're going to,

314
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,460
we're going to let you
do this if you don't,

315
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,170
if you don't play by our rules.

316
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:22,831
But,

317
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:23,664
uh,

318
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,500
I also feel like there's companies that,

319
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,070
if you,

320
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,050
if you're willing to go smaller,

321
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,720
if you're willing to let it
grow a little bit slower,

322
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,490
that you can scale up,

323
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:36,030
but you can become a
big ethical corporation.

324
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,840
Yeah.

325
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,840
[inaudible]

326
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,133
okay.

327
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,290
You ready to record recording?

328
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:07,591
Oh,

329
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:08,424
it is already,

330
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,510
what the fuck's on?
