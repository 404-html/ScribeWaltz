1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,720
The joe rogan experience cause
you guys see the video of them,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,081
uh,

3
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:04,710
with uh,

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,740
with of youtue and Jimmy
Fallon on the opening night?

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,580
No,

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,413
I don't think so.

7
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,060
Oh my God,

8
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:15,060
listen is one of the most transformative
moments of my life over the last year

9
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,940
was fallen asleep on the couch.

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,010
Um,

11
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,440
you know,

12
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,400
whatever I worked out it had something
to eat and I was sitting on the couch and

13
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:25,350
a lot of times I watched like,

14
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,373
uh,

15
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,080
I watched like bow hunting
shows or watch MMA fights.

16
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:32,370
I'm a fucking caveman.

17
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,350
If you came over and looked at my DVR,

18
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:34,801
you feel like,

19
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,540
what the fuck is going on here?

20
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,040
I just like what I like.

21
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,461
Okay.

22
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:39,540
I'm not judging myself,

23
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,780
but I fell asleep and I woke up and it
was the premiere of the Jimmy Fallon a

24
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,320
first season,

25
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,480
first episode of it's night show.

26
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,390
And as I woke up,

27
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,480
youtue was singing the acapella version
of ordinary love or acoustic version

28
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,680
rather of ordinary love.

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,940
And uh,

30
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,631
Jamie pull it,

31
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:01,410
pull it up.

32
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,320
Is that from the frozen
sense to you too on,

33
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,443
Hahaha.

34
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,713
No,

35
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,183
listen,

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,990
it's a brilliant new song from you too,

37
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,600
but it's not just that it's brilliant.

38
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,970
It's one of those moments where,

39
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:15,420
um,

40
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,910
you're watching in Bano,

41
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,010
you're watching like a,

42
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,410
just a fucking brilliant artist.

43
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,360
Say what you want about that guy,

44
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:24,901
you know,

45
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:29,850
say what you want about his political
ties and his charitable causes and his

46
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,040
sunglasses indoors at night set.

47
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:32,970
Which one about that guy?

48
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,540
That guy is a bad motherfucker and
whatever it is out there that makes things

49
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:39,630
great,

50
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,560
whatever it is,

51
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,710
where you're watching pink singing while
she's spiraling around over an audience

52
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:46,250
and,

53
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,880
and never losing tune and knowing that
it's completely live or whether it's Bano

54
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:55,881
sitting on that fucking couch and youtube
behind him playing and Jimmy Fallon is

55
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:02,391
sitting there and will Smith is sitting
there and it's so undeniably brilliant

56
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:06,121
that I,

57
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:11,121
I woke up from a nap sitting on the couch
to woke up just in time for them to be

58
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:16,470
joking around and then go into that song.

59
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,350
Like the universe wanted me to see this.

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,140
It's fucking perfect.

61
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,840
It's a perfect moment of entertainment.

62
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:27,750
It has perfect music.

63
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,030
It has a perfect response.

64
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,190
It has a perfect moment being the
premiere of Jimmy Fallon's version of the

65
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,180
tonight show.

66
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,510
It has perfect being one of the greatest
actors ever will Smith is sitting

67
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,151
there.

68
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:44,700
I mean a huge fucking movie star.

69
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,270
I mean people don't think
he's a bad ass mother fucker.

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,410
I've never seen him play Muhammad Ali.

71
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,161
You know,

72
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:53,820
I mean if you don't think
will is a bad motherfucker.

73
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:56,400
It's some weird jealousy thing.

74
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:59,370
I mean he's like one of those
Tom Cruise type characters.

75
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,480
So look at this,

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,313
watch this.

77
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,690
This is all live too.

78
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,790
I never even paid

79
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,160
and it's rare that I hear a song and
for the first time I get goosebumps.

80
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,543
Yeah,

81
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,330
we're all said and done.

82
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,410
This performance is going to go down
there with the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan

83
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:41,244
show.

84
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,303
Same.

85
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,600
We'll take care of you,

86
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,050
fill that house and the tree.

87
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,730
Remember this moment

88
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,110
sitting there t shirt and gyms.

89
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,450
My mouth is wide open.

90
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,893
I was asleep.

91
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,150
And then all of a sudden,

92
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,430
purist version of what we love

93
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,983
about

94
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,470
this mother fucker is in this

95
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,110
room and here was his,

96
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:50,220
he,

97
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,210
he just has the routes to take in.

98
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,570
That's another level because now
it's like this gets up and stands up.

99
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,060
Like it's going to be closer with them.

100
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,990
And you can see there enjoying it too.

101
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,840
Everything just kicks up to the next level

102
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,070
and the audience just starts going crazy.

103
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,720
They're going crazy.

104
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,430
He sees his three times.

105
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,850
That's crazy.

106
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,170
It was fucking beautiful.

107
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,370
And when they pull away,

108
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:37,440
the audience is standing up and
they're all on their feed screening.

109
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,710
This is not a guy with a sign stand up,

110
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,341
stand up,

111
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:40,701
clap,

112
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:41,330
applaud.

113
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,111
Like if you go to those,

114
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:42,410
uh,

115
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,880
like if you go to the
tonight shows shaping,

116
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:45,320
at least the old ones they used to have,

117
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:46,700
a guy would tell you when to applaud.

118
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,950
There's like signs
would light up or a guy,

119
00:05:48,951 --> 00:05:49,251
we're like,

120
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:50,084
hold up a sign.

121
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,230
It's crazy.

122
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,340
That was some beautiful shit.

123
00:05:52,341 --> 00:05:53,150
Right?

124
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,983
That was amazing.

125
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,990
And I love the roots.

126
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,180
Got It.

127
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,911
God Damn.

128
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:56,541
I love them.

129
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,980
I loved I the band.

130
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:59,030
I love Jimmy Fallon,

131
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,290
but I loved that moment.

132
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,220
That moment is tell.

133
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,220
I'll never forget that
the sit in and by myself,

134
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,600
gym shorts,

135
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,970
still sweaty,

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,020
like staring at the TV and it
comes on and I'm just like,

137
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,010
God damn.

138
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,240
I just saw something.

139
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,040
I saw fucking shooting star.

140
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,450
I saw an asteroid hit,

141
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,620
I saw some freaky shit.

142
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,430
You know?

143
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,780
I mean that's crazy that an asteroid,

144
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,710
that's only happened once.

145
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,470
Asteroids hit too many times.

146
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,011
You know what I mean?

147
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:25,850
How many fucking,

148
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,120
how many times has there been a big
hole slammed into in the earth because a

149
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,900
rock fell from the sky a lot.

150
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:37,901
How many times has youtube been on the
Jimmy Fallon shy once you two was on the

151
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:38,721
Jimmy Fallon show?

152
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,360
One time ever and it was the first time.

153
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:45,170
There's only one first time ever in the
whole universe that you two is going to

154
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,250
be on the Jimmy Fallon show.

155
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,513
That's crazy.

156
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,400
Unless you believe in true infinity and
then that's the monkey wrench because

157
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:57,401
true infinity means if there is a
you that the world is what you see.

158
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,070
Everything exists in the exact same form,

159
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,340
not only once but infinitely.

160
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,700
So not only are there so many
possibilities in the concept of infinity,

161
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,791
infinity,

162
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,260
meaning infinite possibilities,

163
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:16,790
we can't even imagine what that means.

164
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,330
What that means is that everything
that you've ever experienced,

165
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,410
everything that I've ever experienced
you looking exactly like you,

166
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,150
you looking exactly like you,

167
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,680
you with the same creepy dude,

168
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:32,630
he tried to sneak you into the woods
to see a fucking large mouth bass.

169
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,990
All of that exists in the exact same
order and the exact same form in an

170
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,010
infinite number of times.

171
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,590
So that's how crazy infinity is.

172
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,290
Wrap your fucking head around that.

173
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,390
Like wait a second.

174
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,240
So somewhere out there there is,

175
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,930
it's not just one.

176
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:51,650
So right now,

177
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,483
right there,

178
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,390
not only that,

179
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,980
you two is playing,

180
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,120
you're not supposed to you.

181
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,240
It's like you too.

182
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,170
I say it like you
shouldn't say it that way,

183
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,600
but youtube right now is probably playing
an infinite amount of times all over

184
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:09,410
the universe and at the exact same
moment how the exact same moment,

185
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:12,260
the exact same words are coming
out of the exact same mouth.

186
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,050
That experience everything
that has ever happened,

187
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:19,010
the idea of that never happening again
on the other side of the world for sure.

188
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,400
The Not in the other side of the world,

189
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:21,380
but of the universe.

190
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,410
The idea of everything
that has ever happened,

191
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:29,411
being unique in comparison to the
creation of the world is so preposterous.

192
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,050
The idea that we're so fucking important
because we are able to saying it,

193
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:36,350
capable of talking,

194
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,330
capable of explaining
how important we are,

195
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,200
but the idea that we are any
weirder than a black hole or a son.

196
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,760
I mean it's ridiculous.

197
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:48,500
So the idea of human
civilization happening in the
exact same order everywhere.

198
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:49,040
We'd be like,

199
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,150
how is that possible?

200
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,890
But how would it be possible for that?

201
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:55,710
It'd be other planets that's way crazier
and this is a fucking shit ton of those

202
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,280
dude.

203
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,800
How would it be possible
that there's water in space?

204
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:58,920
Oh,

205
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,753
there's a lot of it.

206
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,450
In fact,

207
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,220
that's where you've seen when
you see a comment stupid,

208
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,290
you seen water flying off
the back of that thing.

209
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,153
That's water.

210
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,640
That's a fucking earth sized chunk
of water flying through space.

211
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,900
Holy Shit.

212
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:10,470
You know?

213
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,741
Yeah.

214
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:11,940
The whole thing is nuts.

215
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:13,590
It's not nuts that you don't exist.

216
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,550
Not just once,

217
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:15,960
but an infinite amount of times.

218
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,020
That's more likely than a star
that's more likely than a black hole.

219
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:26,931
That's more likely than just the idea of
people breathing air and staying alive

220
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:31,710
and fish sucking air out of water and
some fucking weird contraption called

221
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:32,544
Gills.

222
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,810
That's nuts.

223
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,070
All of it's nuts.

224
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,890
The fact that it exists the same place
in the same form all over the the

225
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,650
universe in an infinite amount of times
and exactly the same order that seems

226
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:46,230
like likely you think are nuts.

227
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,064
It is.

228
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,850
That's why when you see a moment like
you to on the Jimmy Fallon show singing

229
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:53,610
that song,

230
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,610
like you're witnessing a universal unique
moment universal through everything to

231
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,890
the whole thing like that.

232
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,780
That feeling you get
when you get goosebumps.

233
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,520
The whole universe got
goosebumps for that.

234
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,320
It's interesting that you woke up for it.

235
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:09,000
It's like you're in tune
with that kind of thing.

236
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,541
No,

237
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,374
I got lucky.

238
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,650
I drag a lot of coconut water,

239
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,440
tried to get some of that
delicious sea two oh coconut water.

240
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:22,230
I probably had a p most likely,

241
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,161
but maybe not.

242
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:23,431
I mean,

243
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:25,320
I'm not convinced that reality is real.

244
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:26,850
I'm not convinced you guys were even here.

245
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,250
I don't know.

246
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:29,790
We're not,

247
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,320
what does youtube Internet stuff?

248
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:33,150
It's kind of a approximation of it,

249
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:33,510
isn't it?

250
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,350
Cause now we can,

251
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,840
we just watched it again and we were
experiencing in a different way.

252
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,550
But that moment has been captured.

253
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,510
We can now repeat itself in
our liquor controlled medium.

254
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:42,930
Right.

255
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,500
So it's maybe this is us piecing together
all these things that you're talking

256
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:47,310
about.

257
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,930
I hope if you see it the first time you
see it before I said anything about it

258
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:52,710
to you.

259
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,640
The last thing I want us to flavor
that moment with some my own,

260
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:56,810
uh,

261
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,061
you know,

262
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:57,301
that's,

263
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:58,150
I think that was a,

264
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,640
just a tremendous performance.

265
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,440
If somebody sees it and you
hear me talking about it,

266
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,080
shut it off and go watch the real thing.

267
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,221
Don't you know,

268
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:06,450
if somebody puts it on youtube,

269
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,120
it might as well be flavors by Joe.

270
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,223
Oh please.

271
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,220
Maybe salt would be better salt,

272
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,320
a little Kumon.

273
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,090
It's really good for you.

274
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,320
It's an anti inflammatory.

275
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,330
But you know,

276
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:25,590
do you guys feel those moments on stage
and realize that you're tapping into

277
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:26,670
something unique when,

278
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:27,510
when that happens,

279
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:29,190
when you hit that that,

280
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,701
you know,

281
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:31,260
we were talking about
when we were playing pool,

282
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,860
like sometimes you just hit this weird
stride where everything's just fallen

283
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,460
into place and it feels like automatic
and you know that there's that moment.

284
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:39,360
I'm sure it's,

285
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,420
it's gotta be very similar to the,

286
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:45,780
the moment like that in comedy with,

287
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,680
with your music,

288
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:49,050
there's gotta be moments where
you guys are just flowing.

289
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,160
You know,

290
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,300
there was a Disney moment,

291
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,310
I don't want to make
me feel uncomfortable,

292
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,910
but there was a moment where you
were on stage and you were saying in,

293
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,680
and it was at the December 21st show,

294
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,920
the 2012 end of the world show and both
Joey Diaz and Eddie Bravo came offstage

295
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,770
and they both at the same time go.

296
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,180
That's a bad ass bitch.

297
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,250
That's a bad ass.

298
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,580
That's a bad ass bitch.

299
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:13,270
Eddie Bravo.

300
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,540
That was a bad ass bitch.

301
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,221
Damn.

302
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,770
Those motherfuckers are talented in it.

303
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,190
He's like,

304
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,230
that's a bad ass bitch.

305
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,751
God Damn,

306
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:20,740
those guys are talented.

307
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,340
But it was that moment where you know you,

308
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,770
it was,

309
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,100
we had never done a show with a musical
act before and a lot of my friends were

310
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,671
skeptical.

311
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:28,061
They were like,

312
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:28,900
what are you guys going to do?

313
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:30,460
Like how's that work together?

314
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,080
How's the wear?

315
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,811
So I go,

316
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:34,620
I think the music probably shouldn't be
in the middle cause it would be like,

317
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,610
it would like interrupt
the flow of the comedy.

318
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:38,860
But I think it would enhance
the beginning of the comedy.

319
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:39,730
And I think,

320
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,001
you know,

321
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:40,960
so we do it this way.

322
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,220
And so when we,

323
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,190
when we did it and you guys got on stage,

324
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,610
it was the first time that Eddie
had ever seen you guys live and uh,

325
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,150
you know,

326
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,140
he was like Holy Shit,

327
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:50,920
they're good.

328
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,180
Who's like the lyrics,

329
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,051
the fucking,

330
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:53,930
the music that,

331
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,210
the choices they made.

332
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,190
He just was just like shaking his head.

333
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,510
But I'll never forget that moment where
they both walked offstage cause they

334
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:02,344
were both shaking there.

335
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,060
Cause you know,

336
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,730
Julian was going to go on
stage next and do some standup.

337
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,430
We got so lucky to be involved with this.

338
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,510
Well we're lucky too.

339
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:11,320
We're all lucky.

340
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,760
We're lucky.

341
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,580
Shit,

342
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,413
I wouldn't be,

343
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,230
you know,

344
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,690
this is what the show would
be completely uninteresting.

345
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:18,070
It was just me talking every week.

346
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,380
I need you guys.

347
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,310
I think you have a lot to say
and it's very interesting.

348
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:21,890
People are hurt.

349
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,080
They've heard it already by now.

350
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,760
I've run out of Shit
to say I repeat myself.

351
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,430
I don't even like listening to me anymore.

352
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,590
But we're,

353
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,960
we're all lucky for reals,

354
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:32,530
you know,

355
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,550
including people listening.

356
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:35,860
We're all in on this and
some fucking weird way.

357
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,630
We're all in on this thing together.

358
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:38,591
It's just that,

359
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:39,190
uh,

360
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,230
folks like you and I,

361
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:43,510
and red ban and whoever's
on the mic out there,

362
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:43,721
you're,

363
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:44,080
you're,

364
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,640
you're a part of the lightning rod.

365
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,580
You're part of the lightning rod
that distributes all this shit.

366
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,690
But we're all in it together.

367
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,860
We don't even know what we're doing.

368
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,210
We don't even know why we're doing it.

369
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,560
We just start doing it.

370
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:55,840
And then somewhere along the
line we realized we love it.

371
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,961
And the next thing you know,

372
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:01,060
he sang in songs or you're telling
jokes or you're fucking making guitars,

373
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:01,960
whatever it is,

374
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:02,290
you know,

375
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,430
you find that thing

376
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,913
CP,

377
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,030
you find that weird,

378
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,190
weird thing out there in the world.

379
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,150
You know,

380
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,983
whatever it is.

381
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,003
And if you don't,

382
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:12,821
God damn,

383
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:13,654
keep looking,

384
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,730
keep looking of like,

385
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,020
go do some browsing myself up.

386
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:21,250
I don't even know if I'm honest.

387
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,980
No questions.

388
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,120
All literature.

389
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,320
It's all fiction.

390
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:27,400
It's coming from the universe.

391
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:29,870
Okay.
