1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,360
How long is it gonna take me to get to
lax and what time should I be there?

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,750
If you leave at two you have no problems
at all.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,750
Okay,
no problem.

4
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:10,230
Call me if you leave it to you.
Just kind to the coast in are we live,

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,290
we're trying to figure out la traffic.
Liz Gentlemen,

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,600
you got to plan for that shit to do man,
like a natural disaster in many ways

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,720
they're very similar.
When I moved to Colorado for just a few

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
months and then came back here was
instantaneous,

9
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:27,300
like the recognition of what effect it
has on me.

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,210
You know like every,
there's so many people you drive and

11
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:34,140
it's like
when you go somewhere where there's very

12
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:35,550
few people you have,
there's a,

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,990
a real feeling of relaxation.
Like it's legitimate.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,220
It's real.
Yes.

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,590
Yeah.
It's almost like if you could buy that

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,420
like a,
yeah man,

17
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:46,950
I'm,
I'm taking this gum.

18
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,080
It puts you in like a small town feel
like woodsy,

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,480
Colorado feel going through evergreen.
Look at it.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,510
You can buy that.
You just have to get out of out of

21
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:58,680
California.
No,

22
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,330
for sure.
But I was just thinking if you had a

23
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:01,700
pill,
a pill,

24
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:04,080
it did that,
that'd be a really expensive pill or a

25
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,810
patch or some gum.
And you're like nicotine gum,

26
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,003
some,
some,

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,240
you know,
peace and quiet.

28
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:12,750
Gum Transports you to the wilderness.
How much would people pay for that?

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,820
Right.
Like think about the people that buy

30
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,360
Xanax and shit and just anything.
Just take a little bit of the edge off

31
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,590
just to take this edge off.
I don't know.

32
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,843
I would,
uh,

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,220
I would probably just buy it and smoke
it.

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,450
Yeah,
it's smoked the shit out.

35
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,970
Right.
But then would you be happy like living

36
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:32,190
in downtown La and some graffiti coming?

37
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,640
Building horns go off.
I love the weather here.

38
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,730
I do.
I think that's why I have to come out

39
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,930
for work or anything else.
I'd never mind because every day is

40
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:43,320
perfect.
So I've been here for like four days and

41
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:45,540
it's raining most of the time,
so it's my luck.

42
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,200
But a la traffic,
you just basically,

43
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:52,740
I think you just sort of accept that
you're going to live in your car,

44
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,360
right?
You're going to be in your car,

45
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,460
lock your reading.
Of course everybody has a nice cars.

46
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:58,140
That's why everybody drives nice cars in
that way.

47
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,330
It's also because we were all really,
really shallow.

48
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,220
Oh,
we want to show everybody like,

49
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:03,460
look what I got,
bitch.

50
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,090
You know?
There's a lot of that.

51
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,530
I liked cars.
I you too.

52
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,350
That's okay.
I think about your song.

53
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,320
When I drive my bronco,
you got an,

54
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,610
you got to really Nice Bronco.

55
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,260
I unfortunately no longer have a bronco.
I need a bronco in your life,

56
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:20,340
man.
Yeah,

57
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,980
but then I'd have a second car.
It took me five years just to buy my

58
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,720
first car.
So yeah,

59
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:26,600
you're one of the minimalist type
characters.

60
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:28,230
It doesn't want to admit they're
successful.

61
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:28,981
I understand.
No,

62
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,480
I got no,
probably admitting that.

63
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,200
I just thought,
you know,

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,960
I look like I've always,
I think it's from living out of a bag

65
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:35,790
most of my adult life and then you
start,

66
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,960
you know,
I had one guitar for the first two or

67
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,960
three years.
I was on the road one day you wake up

68
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:46,760
and you have five guitars now.
Do you have a thing where you don't

69
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,430
really need all these guitars?
You know,

70
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,700
I only need that one.
Maybe two guitars is good.

71
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:55,350
So if I feel like guitar makers who must
want to get you a guitar,

72
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,090
right.

73
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,370
Does that happen with musicians?
Actually I got one Martin made for me

74
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:02,590
and that's,
that's kind of a honor obviously.

75
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,431
That's amazing.
Yeah.

76
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:06,460
The old really old historic legacy
company.

77
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,690
Um,
but then yeah,

78
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:10,390
he buddies build them and that kind of
most,

79
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:14,710
I've always made my own at apartments,
like at least telecasters and stuff.

80
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,930
You can buy parts and assemble them,
uh,

81
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,950
just as good as anything coming out of
like what like a custom shop might be

82
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,600
for a fraction of the cost.
Wow.

83
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,650
That I didn't know that was,
and maybe even build an instrument that

84
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:28,330
is,
you know,

85
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,000
more comfortable to play because you're
building to the exact specifics that may

86
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:36,010
be somebody doesn't mass manufactured.
Well I guess if you know guitars as well

87
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:37,900
as you know them and you've been around
them your whole life,

88
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,920
that totally makes sense.
Like what?

89
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,540
It's wood in parts,
right?

90
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,600
Telecasters basically this table bolted
to a baseball bat cut in half.

91
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,100
You know what I mean?
It's hard to fuck that up.

92
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,300
The rest of it's just the electronics
and the pickups have a lot in anything

93
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:54,970
outside of that's just your fingers and
who's actually holding the thing.

94
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,160
But like to build one is not that
complicated.

95
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,510
Wow.
No Les Paul or a Martin Acoustic Guitar

96
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:03,790
that's,
that's literally like a hand shaped,

97
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,940
uh,
piece of work that has to be made from

98
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,140
start to finish.
Whereas,

99
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,150
you know,
the guitars I'm talking about building,

100
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,480
you're just assembling.
There's like parts that are widely

101
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:16,000
accessible.
I have a buddy that's a classical

102
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,380
guitarist.
That's an art.

103
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,530
That's another thing.
He always had his nails grow long.

104
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:22,090
What he do Jujitsu.
Dimitri,

105
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,390
shout out to my friend Dmitri to Chenko.
Uh,

106
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,140
he had,
uh,

107
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,140
to tape over his fingernails like when
he did Jujitsu cause he had claw called

108
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,640
bitches.

109
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,380
ISRC yeah.
How might the fuckers,

110
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:37,390
I mean he had ridiculous a long nails
and powerful nails too because he

111
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,540
strummed with his nails.
Like that's what he did.

112
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,190
Like he did everything he did with his
fingers.

113
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,450
He's amazing at it.
I mean,

114
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,430
just freaky.
Amazing.

115
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,980
You'd watch him play and he'd be like,
Holy Shit.

116
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,060
Yeah.
You know,

117
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,770
some play live a bunch of times and he
would do like people would hire him to

118
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,630
do like parties and shit,
but it's like a,

119
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:59,410
it's an art form that for whatever
reason I don't think gets the kind of

120
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:03,010
respect that it deserves.
No flamenco and classical guitar

121
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,641
players.
That's,

122
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:06,040
that's someone as highly complex
musicianship.

123
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,130
And so he would always explain to me
like guitars,

124
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,360
like how they were constructed.
And it's amazing to me that there is,

125
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,750
that's Dimitri,
that dude was the heavyweight on the

126
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,930
taekwondo team that I was on when I was
a,

127
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,550
like a lightweight.
I was at 155 pounds and he was fighting

128
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:30,120
heavyweight.
That dude used to fuck people up.

129
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,870
He's got those crazy Ukrainian genes we
just got to do.

130
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:36,060
She can pick anywhere that's like,
oh,

131
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:37,080
he's a bad motherfucker.

132
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,710
I don't know shit about guitar.
I know it sounds awesome.

133
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,220
And I know that sounds awesome.
But to you as a person who plays guitar.

134
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,540
Oh,
that's country guitar.

135
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,340
That's like he's checking what we call
chicken pickin.

136
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,770
What he's doing when their class group
tours.

137
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,770
Pretty cool.
He could,

138
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,450
he might as well be on lower Broadway
right now.

139
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,000
It's bad mother fucker.
Mother fucker for sure.

140
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,283
And

141
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,030
was a Massachusetts state.
Taekwondo heavyweight also doesn't make

142
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:03,290
silly faces.
I like that,

143
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,950
you know,
he went on to compete after I stopped

144
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,050
competing.
He competed a really high level

145
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:12,730
nationally,
like fondant to the one he puts like a

146
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:14,270
tar down.
He's still a bad motherfucker.

147
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,690
That's a legit bad motherfucker.
He's a big boy too.

148
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,990
Like he's a natural to 20 like the Big
Ukrainian rock people.

149
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,970
They're just sicker people.
The Rock people,

150
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:30,020
they could pick rocks up and shit.
Then on top of that unbelievable

151
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:31,370
guitarist.
Crazy.

152
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,770
How do you,
how do you know him?

153
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,920
We used to do taekwondo together when we
were kids,

154
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,210
we started out together.
I was like,

155
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,080
I think he's a year younger than me,
so I think I was like 15 or 16 when we

156
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,560
met and he was like 14 was he like eight
hours a day sitting homeless guitar?

157
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,430
Like all this discipline,
man,

158
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,330
I don't know if it's disciplined so
much,

159
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,483
Eh,

160
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,490
I think everybody that that plays music
and it really gets into it that heavily.

161
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,320
There's like,
there's like a,

162
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,120
it's a,
it's an ocd that you have to have a

163
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:07,500
level of spectrum or to sit and just do
the same thing over and over

164
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:08,370
repetitively,
eight,

165
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:11,310
10 hours a day.
Especially in as a kid when you're

166
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:13,260
really learning,
you like when he gets you and you hook

167
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:14,530
into it,
it's like you just did this.

168
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:17,460
The other thing that nobody else can be
a part of it.

169
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:17,530
Yeah.

170
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,100
You know what I mean?
I get it as an outsider,

171
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:24,700
I get it.
It's like you can do some thing and once

172
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:27,310
you start doing it,
it must feel amazing to be doing it

173
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:28,230
well.
Yeah.

174
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:29,450
Okay.

175
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:29,930
Yeah,
I think,

176
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,700
well,
I mean I played soccer and stuff when I

177
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,810
was a kid,
but it was always like,

178
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:36,950
I've never was one of those guys that
the team thing.

179
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,920
Yeah.
So it was just like introverted and did

180
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,690
and so when I found really found guitar
and got into it as like,

181
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:42,770
oh,
this is something I can,

182
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,270
it's not a competition.
It's not,

183
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,150
uh,
you know,

184
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:49,730
other than what you,
what you're pushing yourself to learn,

185
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:50,350
I guess.

186
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,171
Yeah,
you did.

187
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,200
You don't have to rely on other people's
personalities or,

188
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,790
well,
that's what bands are for.

189
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,520
That's what I always thought about
bands.

190
00:07:57,521 --> 00:08:00,940
Like that's gotta be the hardest part is
everybody just being cool.

191
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,550
Typically the crazy artists.
Well,

192
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:04,540
yeah.
You especially,

193
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,543
um,

194
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,520
okay.

195
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,010
I mean it's really all about the hang
more than anything.

196
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,410
I'm uh,
I'm d I got me and three other guys in

197
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:13,910
my band now cause it,
and it's like

198
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,880
everybody's a great hang.
Dad's awesome.

199
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:19,690
Everybody gets along and we're like
actually friends and you go out every

200
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,523
night.
We're just like,

201
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,680
you know,
if you could pull that off and it makes

202
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:25,630
the road better.
Like when I go on the road,

203
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,240
I bring like Ian Edwards or Tony
Hinchcliffe or any my other friends that

204
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,220
that can do it.
If it's,

205
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,520
it's all like,
whether that they're free that weekend,

206
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:35,050
that's usually how it goes.
You're going to be around these people

207
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:35,890
for weeks,
man.

208
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,450
Oh Man.
We have the best time.

209
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,850
I don't do weeks.
I do still a couple of days at a time.

210
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,530
I never go on the road for more than a
Thursday,

211
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:42,670
Friday,
Saturday anymore.

212
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,320
I just stuck in warrior.
Yeah.

213
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,970
Really.
And I only do it twice a week.

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,520
Is that because of the kids and just be
at home?

215
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,590
I like being home and also because I can
travel makes you old.

216
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,170
Well,
it's just not good for you.

217
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,400
It's just not good for you.
Um,

218
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,021
it's,
so,

219
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,250
it's all those things.
It's,

220
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,010
I like being around my family.
I like being at home.

221
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:05,040
I like being around my friends and also,
um,

222
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,470
I just don't think it's a healthy thing.
I think travel on occasions.

223
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,250
Okay.
But I think once you start getting into

224
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,310
like every weekend flying,
I've heard of people doing that and I'm

225
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,660
like,
you're beating your body up.

226
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,230
Yeah,
there's no,

227
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,660
there's no if ands or buts about it.
It,

228
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:19,410
well it's,
it's,

229
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,140
it's one of the best things about

230
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,920
certainly my job and your job.
You get to go out and perform,

231
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:29,950
entertain.
But I bought since since things sort of

232
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:33,730
took off for me,
I realized very early on I'm,

233
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,640
I get paid to travel.
The shows are free.

234
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,320
Like that Shit's fun.
You know what I mean?

235
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,900
We're out there doing what we love to
do,

236
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:45,790
but it's all the in between and the beat
down your body takes and being out of

237
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,440
any kind of routine and away from your
family.

238
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:49,570
That's,
that's the really the thing that you

239
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:51,670
come off for like four or five weeks
straight or that,

240
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,041
and you know,
I'm a,

241
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,680
I'm a pretty healthy 39 year old dude
and it takes me four or five days just

242
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:59,680
to get off the fucking couch after a
month long run.

243
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,140
And my wife,
she finally started to understand like

244
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:02,974
it's cause you're

245
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,230
the travel,
you know,

246
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,960
it's a different kind of exhaustion.
You can't really articulate.

247
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:12,320
I think there's a travel,
there's the sleeping cause usually

248
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,070
you've got to get out if you're doing
every day to,

249
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,100
are you busting it?
Are you flying around buses?

250
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:17,840
Mostly.
Unless it's like

251
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,290
the logistics is just crazy but you
still got to be there so you might bust

252
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,740
part of it and then one night you're
flying everybody or,

253
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,780
or a red light red hour the next morning
and do that thing and then get back to

254
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:30,220
the bus or meet up with the bus.

255
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,450
What helps me is cardio.
Like uh,

256
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,930
when uh,
whenever I go to a place,

257
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:36,340
if I just,
I don't want to,

258
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:38,410
I feel like shove like Ah,
fucking tired.

259
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,490
But if I could just force myself to get
to the gym and just do like 45 minutes

260
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:44,770
on an elliptical machine,
just that 45 minutes out of the day.

261
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:45,970
Just that,
that's what I'm doing,

262
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,770
period.
Nothing else.

263
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,310
Put the headphones on,
listen to a podcast listener and just

264
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:54,910
get that cardio.
And then I'm good,

265
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,800
then I'm straight,
then everything levels out.

266
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,950
But if I don't do that,
if I don't do that every couple of days,

267
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,080
at least I just feel worn out.

268
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,230
I think it's also an endorphin
imbalance.

269
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,240
Like my,
uh,

270
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,880
my buddy bobby that plays,
we're going to be,

271
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:11,560
but he works out like a madman.
I mean like it's kind of insane.

272
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:12,840
You guys would get along.
Uh,

273
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,430
and I think a lot of those to balance
out,

274
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,820
you know,
just energy cause every night you go out

275
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:21,640
and do,
we get two hours of cardio right on

276
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:25,990
stage and just massive adrenaline blast,
especially when it really locks in and

277
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:28,840
there's all this energy just slamming
you in the face and then you walk off

278
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:32,860
stage and it takes like four or five
hours to come down from that every

279
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,490
night.
Yeah.

280
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,570
And then,
so you know,

281
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,040
in the next day now your shit has to be
off balance naturally.

282
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,080
You know what I mean?
Just like you just had this massive

283
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:44,590
blast of all these chemicals that your
brain's pumping out endorphins.

284
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:47,290
And now the next day you're just like
waking up trying to figure out where to

285
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:51,520
take a shit and get a cup of coffee.
And is there a shower today

286
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:53,980
and he gets

287
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,750
weird when you do a bunch of them in a
row,

288
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:57,580
right?
Like how often do you wake up and stare

289
00:11:57,581 --> 00:12:00,190
at the ceiling?
Not exactly remembering what town you're

290
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:01,960
in.
Um,

291
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:02,820
not,
well,

292
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,200
that never happens because I'm like,
oh,

293
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:07,900
I'm always staying a week or two,
I guess the adventure,

294
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,160
the journey,
so to speak.

295
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:09,994
But,
uh,

296
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,220
I do wake up sometimes and just sort of,
well,

297
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,470
honestly it's,
it's bitter sweet because the longer

298
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:20,200
you're out,
the more you're playing in,

299
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:22,480
the better the music gets.
So,

300
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:23,960
you know,
by the last show you,

301
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,660
there's always this really like,
man,

302
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,501
you know,
I'm exhausted.

303
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,030
I really want to go home,
but I can't believe this.

304
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,930
We got to take a break now because
everything just got super greasy,

305
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,010
you know?
Right.

306
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,630
Um,
it's different every night.

307
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,880
But you just the chemistry and
everything and you lock in and you just

308
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,780
kind of getting that head.

309
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,870
Yeah,
I could imagine that it's a,

310
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:43,140
comedy is very similar.
It's very similar.

311
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,640
Like when you're doing like a long
stretch.

312
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:49,940
I only did it once with Charlie Murphy
and John Heffron.

313
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,970
We did this whole tour together is the
only time I've done like 30 days where I

314
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:56,080
did like 22 dates where it's just
constantly out.

315
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,090
I was only home for a day or two and
then went back out again.

316
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,540
But you get group,
you get in that groove,

317
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,730
you just get lawyer where you just
relaxed.

318
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,160
I've been doing it a lot.
If you feel it,

319
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,700
you get on this nonexistent Clark.
It's a,

320
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,543
it's a,
it's a,

321
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,050
it's a,
a routine of new routine is how I'd

322
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:14,980
describe it.
Every day is the same but completely

323
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,110
different.
Um,

324
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,430
but I,
I don't mind that man.

325
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:22,240
Like a lot of times it feels like I'm
just back in the navy because we still

326
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:23,560
asleep in bunks on the bus.

327
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,490
You know,
we,

328
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,370
we'd go out to sea for like 90 days and
shit and that was,

329
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,720
that's probably way better for you
psychologically when you go onstage than

330
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,260
if you're staying in some giant suite
when you're walking around the suite and

331
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,570
they get on a plane,
can't do the hotel rooms,

332
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:38,231
ma'am,
I get,

333
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:39,700
I get it.
You know when he started out and you

334
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:41,050
meet all,
you start going on,

335
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,920
you play like festivals or shows with
your heroes and they're on buses before

336
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:48,660
you are and you go on and you talk to
these guys and then you realize like

337
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,340
they live in this thing,
they're institutionalized in the back of

338
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:53,080
this bus and they never get off the bus
and you're like,

339
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:56,860
I don't get it.
And then it happens to you and you

340
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:59,800
realize that that's like this little
safe space,

341
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:02,110
like a hotel room overnight for me.

342
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,300
I'll go,
I'll go crazy waiting for a show.

343
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,370
You're like caged up in this little box,
you know,

344
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,720
with cable TV and nobody to talk to.
And I got soured on buses when they

345
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:14,200
pulled over willy and arrested him for
weed on his bus,

346
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:16,100
I guess should have been demoted man.
Like

347
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,730
for sure we got Willie on a pot shard as
good for you sherlock.

348
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,010
How dare you?
Whoever you are does things.

349
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:26,440
You just gotta let slide.
That was in Texas too,

350
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:27,274
right?
Yep.

351
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,590
Texas doesn't play when it comes to
weed,

352
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,480
unfortunately.
It's really silly.

353
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,070
If it did,
it would change Texas.

354
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,910
It would make it better.
Like could relax some of those fucking

355
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:41,800
cowboys settled down.
And why you saying it shouldn't be legal

356
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,000
stupid.
That's crazy.

357
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,920
The fact that that's still an argument
in 2018 you know,

358
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,220
they said,
here's a funny one,

359
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,590
one of the most recent arguments that
I've read,

360
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,160
was it pedestrians walking

361
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,670
out into traffic because of legal weed
and dying.

362
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,190
So like there's been an uptick
everywhere.

363
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,230
I shouldn't laugh at that.
That's rude.

364
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,910
It could be me,
right?

365
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,660
It could be me.
Why am I laughing?

366
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:06,860
Almost me this morning.
I'm an asshole.

367
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sorry.
I apologize,

368
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,580
but I thought it was pretty funny.
This idea that a,

369
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,500
there's an uptick in people just walking
out in the cars getting hit by cars

370
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:17,540
cause they're just spacing out cause
they're high.

371
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,710
I think it should be legal just because
I'm from Kentucky and if they gave all

372
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:25,430
those farmers and,
and uh,

373
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,960
you know,
x coal industry employees and an

374
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:31,830
industry that would really thrive since
it grows extremely well and Kentucky,

375
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,360
uh,
you know,

376
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:36,210
instead of soybeans and tobacco,
those guys could actually generate an

377
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:37,940
income.
What do you think is holding it?

378
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,040
The family community politics.
Actually that's not true.

379
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,620
Mitch Mcconnell or if they,
or somebody somewhere like really

380
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:47,160
staunch right wing guy in Kentucky came
out and was even pushing for legislation

381
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,500
towards at least the hemp industry,
which would be incredible.

382
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,450
Yeah,
the Hampton,

383
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,190
this tree is a no brainer.
Then you can look at the tax numbers

384
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:55,200
alone.
Well,

385
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:58,230
you know,
we buy him for on it and for the longest

386
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:02,400
time we'd had to buy it in Canada
because you couldn't get it in the

387
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:05,280
United States because until recently it
wasn't legal to grow.

388
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,030
And so to get like the best stuff that
is the highest protein content,

389
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:10,590
we'd have to fucking ship it in from
Canada.

390
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:13,770
You can't even grow it here now you can.
Um,

391
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,230
but when,
I mean,

392
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,210
what did we start on it?
And it's not that long ago,

393
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,980
wants to like seven years ago,
something like that.

394
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,030
So we,
that was like one of the first things

395
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,870
that we did is a make a really good
help,

396
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,020
a hemp protein powder.
And when we were looking into it like I

397
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,180
can't even believe that you can't grow
this.

398
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,180
Like it doesn't do anything to your
consciousness.

399
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,220
Zero.
It doesn't affect you at all because

400
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:37,380
it's related to pot.
It's illegal.

401
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,330
The national hemp

402
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,420
museum is in Versailles.
Kentucky isn't really where I graduated

403
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,150
high school though,
cause it's Woodford county.

404
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:50,780
Kentucky was at one point the largest
hint producing county in the entire

405
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:52,360
nation.
It just,

406
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,110
I don't know,
something about the limestone,

407
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:55,850
this whole conditions,
the humidity,

408
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,100
sunlight,
oh,

409
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,750
shot and hemp grows really,
really well.

410
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,220
Wow.
The first legal 508 or acre hemp farm in

411
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:07,850
Kentucky unveiled.
So now it's legal in October.

412
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,700
Oh Wow.
So now they can grow it.

413
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,110
Excellent.
Beautiful.

414
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:13,640
I don't live there anymore,
so I'm out of touch.

415
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:14,780
But Hey,
that's great news.

416
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,380
That's fantastic news.
That's amazing.

417
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,790
Well,
we were just talking about something and

418
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,180
I was going to bring up,
uh,

419
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,660
Shit.
I can't remember.

420
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:31,100
It's something about something about new
Mr. Nelson,

421
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,140
something new,
stuff that had to do with,

422
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:36,140
um,
with legalization of marijuana in

423
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:37,580
Kentucky.
We were just talking about,

424
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,440
yeah.
It's just,

425
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,400
it's just pretty crazy that you'd have a
hemp museum and have it be illegal for

426
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:45,020
so long with no argument.
There's like,

427
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:47,030
there's no science.
It doesn't pollute anything.

428
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:48,470
It doesn't do anything.
Dean environment,

429
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,520
the nature makes amazingly

430
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,550
built on it.
Everything was made out of that shit.

431
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,820
Did you ever see the first Henry Ford
model t where he made the fenders out of

432
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:58,950
hap and he's hitting it with a hammer
and not know that?

433
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,720
Did you gotta Watch this?
We'll play this for you.

434
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,050
It's the craziest shit ever.
Henry Ford's very first car that he

435
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:07,290
made.
He made the fenders out of hemp and

436
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,730
you're watching him hit this fucking
fender with a hammer and a hammer is

437
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,900
bouncing off the fender.
Check this out.

438
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,000
This is crazy.
I mean,

439
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,350
I don't know.
When was this?

440
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:18,210
What did it say?
Jamie was the time it said there.

441
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,010
1941 1941 so in 1941 before it was
illegal,

442
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:25,410
so it was made,
it was made illegal right around the

443
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:29,670
time where alcohol prohibition had ended
and they needed something to go after.

444
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,800
So then they started using the same guys
to go after wheat and this was pre that,

445
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,490
look at this,
he's hitting this fucking thing with the

446
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,110
back of an ax and it's just bouncing
off.

447
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,130
It was also a great way to discriminate
against Mexican immigrants.

448
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,500
It was,
and a black people too.

449
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,660
The whole name marijuana came from a
Mexican slang for a while.

450
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:54,240
Tobacco didn't have anything to do with
marijuana.

451
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,830
They just created this thing like when
they made it illegal,

452
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,660
the people that were,
they didn't even understand they're

453
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:03,450
making hemp illegal.
They had to all dad explain it to

454
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:06,450
everybody.
Then they were like tax stamps that you

455
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:08,880
had to,
dupont understood that.

456
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,280
Oh they incidents then understood the
fuck out of it.

457
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,760
So that William Randolph hearst,
that guy was the craziest.

458
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,590
The Guy who citizen Kane was a based on
rules boob.

459
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,540
That guy was the craziest.
So here it is.

460
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,090
This guy's hitting this hemp fender with
a fucking hammer,

461
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:26,190
Henry Rollins testing it.
Henry Rollins,

462
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,360
goddammit.
Look,

463
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,390
you barely smudge the thing.
I mean there's so superior to metal and

464
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:34,860
it's easy.

465
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,870
It's a renewable resource.
Like we're,

466
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,530
we've fucked this up so bad.
It's so obvious.

467
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,360
It's one of the biggest exam people
said,

468
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:43,980
why do you drone on about pot all the
time?

469
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,940
It's cause he's things like that.
Or one of the biggest examples of just

470
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:52,440
how agregious making it illegal is it is
a,

471
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,100
it's one of the most amazing plants
we've ever discovered.

472
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,010
You can make your house out of it.
You can fucking eat at it.

473
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,880
You can get high with it.
You can make your clothes with it.

474
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,300
It has all the amino acids you could use
for heating oil.

475
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,830
You get what intrigued cancer patients
to treat cancer patients with this here

476
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:11,311
for,
I mean,

477
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,930
somebody put it here,
come on,

478
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,250
come on,
come on.

479
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,070
Right.
It helps reduce tumor sides.

480
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,920
It's crazy.
Helps a host of different diseases.

481
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,600
I know a lot of people that have like
serious inflammation problems and they

482
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,860
smoke some weed and they're all right.
Just lightens everything up and it's

483
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:34,380
illegal and you can grow it.
You grow your own.

484
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,600
You could grow a shit ton of it in your
backyard.

485
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,660
Anybody could do you have a sprinkler?
Okay.

486
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,220
You guys good dirt.
All right.

487
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,260
You got some weed that we just good to
go.

488
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:46,940
That's a fucking hardy ass plant.
Yeah.

489
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,830
My Grandmother,

490
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,670
uh,
she just had some,

491
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:53,380
some,
some health stuff and it's like,

492
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:54,214
you know,
how do I,

493
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,750
you know,
she was pretty old school.

494
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,570
Like knowing there's this thing out
there that that isn't anything that

495
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:04,630
these doctors are going to offer her.
That's just gonna make her feel awful.

496
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,710
Yeah.
And,

497
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:06,544
and,
uh,

498
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,310
you know,
or have to go through all of those

499
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:11,020
things that just gives you comfort or
ease,

500
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:13,510
nausea or make you want to eat food or
those kinds of things.

501
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:16,570
Like why wouldn't you want someone you
love and care about to have that?

502
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,790
But then at the same time,
you know,

503
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,750
you want to be the person trying to
feed pots,

504
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:23,980
your grandmother.
Yeah.

505
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:26,950
It's a hard sell.
It's a hard sell.

506
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,220
Yeah.
It's just

507
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,003
stunning

508
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,100
how well propaganda from 1933 carried
all the way the fuck to 2018 it's

509
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:41,390
stunning.
Is it?

510
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,670
I mean,
but it's almost a hundred years with

511
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:47,360
what we like the amount of information
that you can get on a subject now.

512
00:21:47,361 --> 00:21:50,150
Like say if you're the bit the medical
benefits of cannabis,

513
00:21:50,151 --> 00:21:52,640
just google that and you'll just start
reading all this shit.

514
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,520
Like if it seems to me that enough
people would go,

515
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:56,570
wait,
what are we doing?

516
00:21:56,571 --> 00:21:58,910
Like why is it illegal?
Nobody's died from it.

517
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,270
Like no one more people die of aspirin
every year.

518
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,210
Okay.

519
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,600
Cause Zero die from pot.
So it's really the number zero.

520
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,450
It doesn't mean that people aren't going
to get high and walk into traffic.

521
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,090
Some psalm we're Gunna,
but I think part of that is because

522
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,460
we're not to teach teaching people how
to get high properly.

523
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,280
Someone gets hired for the first time
you looked up tone or how many of those

524
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:19,860
people that are getting hit by cars,
we're actually looking at their phones.

525
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,810
Could be a lot.
They were high and looking at their

526
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:24,240
phones.
You don't see that here like you doing

527
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,300
in Nashville.
I drove around and I know that's like,

528
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,270
I can't hate that every time I'm just
driving around town and everybody's

529
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:31,620
texting.
Everybody's looking at you can always

530
00:22:31,621 --> 00:22:33,000
spot on the interstate.
Yup.

531
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,890
Weaving,
but you don't see that in California.

532
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:36,210
He goes,
you guys have like really heavy wall

533
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:36,960
today.

534
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,010
Yeah.
Today,

535
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:42,450
some lady had drifted completely in my
lane and I looked over at her and I saw

536
00:22:42,451 --> 00:22:47,010
the the back of her head like I was,
I was on her driver's side.

537
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:50,490
I was on that side looking over at her
and all I saw was the back of rich.

538
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:54,030
Literally wasn't looking at my car and
she was just looking at her phone and

539
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:56,400
working her thumb.
And occasionally like looking up at the

540
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:58,680
screen or looking up at the windshields
like,

541
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,150
whoa,
you crazy lady.

542
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,040
You think just cause you're going 40
miles an hour.

543
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,630
That's okay because you were on a side
street.

544
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,570
Like you're not even looking where you
going.

545
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,220
You travel to a car.
What if you hit a kid?

546
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,140
Jesus Christ.

547
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,630
Okay.

548
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,630
Fuck.
What if you slam into some Old Lady?

549
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,900
You know what?
If you rear end a bike,

550
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,360
you're not even looking.
You didn't even notice the bike was

551
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:20,991
there.
Boom,

552
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:25,130
you run over some guy's leg.
What in the fuck lady or dude,

553
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,340
maybe I was mis-gendering.
I don't know.

554
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,010
I don't know what her status is.
You gotta be real careful today.

555
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,920
Sturgeon makes it like that and
Nashville is ever be like super.

556
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:35,540
I don't know Bro.
I don't leave the house.

557
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,600
I really don't have any idea.
I just,

558
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,550
I think that's a good move.
Um,

559
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,150
you know,
I like my kids.

560
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,040
Um,
I mean

561
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,220
I'm somewhat aware of everything going
on.

562
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,110
It's so surprising that none of that's
really hit the music business as hard as

563
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:55,060
it is.
But um,

564
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,050
uh,
there's just,

565
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,360
yeah,
I try to just do my thing.

566
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,770
Yeah.
It's a weird,

567
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,480
weird world we're living in today.

568
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,900
I would like a,
I would like us to figure this out

569
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:11,720
better.
I would like us to do just a little bit

570
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:13,790
better job,
being nice to each other,

571
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,780
getting our shit together.

572
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,870
So weird,
weird time.

573
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,710
It's real worse.
The strangest,

574
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,500
strangest times in my lifetime,
which isn't that long,

575
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,590
but that I can recall.
I don't ever remember things ever being

576
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,900
like whatever this is,
you know?

577
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,241
Yeah.
And I,

578
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:37,100
and I don't mean that in any generalized
middle of the road just says go at least

579
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:37,934
like

580
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,220
crazy shit with superpowers talking
about nuclear bombs all the time

581
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:44,450
everyday now.
And it's just like,

582
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:46,450
how did we get back there?
You know,

583
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,450
how do we get back to Putin telling us
that he has some new nuclear missile

584
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:52,760
that you see that shit like,
yeah.

585
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:57,230
1500 meter tsunami wave of apocalyptic
death.

586
00:24:57,231 --> 00:25:00,200
That thing could Bama is why the fuck
man?

587
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,350
And we don't have a defense system that
can deal with it.

588
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,030
So he's basically saying,
I could kill you.

589
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:07,310
I have a gun pointed at you had a gay
anytime.

590
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,930
Welcome to 2018.

591
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,130
Oh yeah.
Donald trump's president.

592
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,880
I did that too,
by the way.

593
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

594
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,970
I don't know what I mean,
it's terrifying is,

595
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,630
it's definitely cause for concern at
all.

596
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,780
This wall pot's illegal

597
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,570
pot's illegal,
but it's legal to have a guy who was the

598
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:29,740
host of the apprentice

599
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,420
run the nuclear armament or armory,
you'd say armory.

600
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:36,030
Right.
Uh,

601
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,380
you know,
I got some trouble a few months ago

602
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:41,380
because I did this.
I had nothing to do one night and I went

603
00:25:41,381 --> 00:25:44,230
down and it was all,
the whole thing was just the protest,

604
00:25:44,231 --> 00:25:46,510
kind of based on like answering
questions.

605
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,330
I was just like,
the promise I made this buddy of mine

606
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:52,600
had a,
he videotaped it and he had a press

607
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:53,550
pass.
They couldn't tell us,

608
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,170
turn the camera off.
And somebody asked me,

609
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,540
what do you think about trump?
And I answered it.

610
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,210
But uh,
so what they didn't ask,

611
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,480
what do you think of all politicians?
You know what I mean?

612
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,390
To me like nothing ever really changes
look right,

613
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:11,650
left this or that.
It's all just sort of a different

614
00:26:11,651 --> 00:26:13,930
version of the people you never really
see.

615
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,640
We can't have an Alpha chimp.
Yeah,

616
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,240
it's a stupid position.
We shouldn't have it anymore.

617
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,690
We shouldn't have had it a long time
ago.

618
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,180
We should have figured out a long time
ago do.

619
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,670
You can't have one person run the whole
show.

620
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,650
It's insane.
It doesn't work.

621
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,080
It's crazy for them too.
It's not good for anybody.

622
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,430
So w w we can't pretend anymore that one
person is special above other people.

623
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:36,470
Like royalty doesn't work anymore.
It doesn't work.

624
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,920
We're all just people.
It doesn't work and you can't get voted

625
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:44,070
into the number one person on the world.
That's fucking apparently

626
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,030
you can't.
You can,

627
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,750
but you shouldn't be able to.
It's it's too old.

628
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,450
It's too antiquated and there's way
better options.

629
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,570
There's just way better options.
You can't have all of us like,

630
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,580
and you can have like some arbitrary
date.

631
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,280
The prevalence [inaudible] episode of
the voices are saying,

632
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,390
well it has,
it's got a timer thing as a buzzer.

633
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:04,620
The voice now man,
that's,

634
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:06,120
that's just how it works,
you know,

635
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,440
or American idol or something like that.
There's a bustle big contest.

636
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,260
You mean during the trophy when you,
when you vote there's a buzzer did

637
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:15,000
buzzers over,
you can't vote anymore.

638
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,840
Right,
right.

639
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,250
The votes are in,
that's it.

640
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,630
And the drum roll please.
I mean it's Showbiz.

641
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,070
I Dunno man.
It doesn't make any sense that you,

642
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,150
I mean I guess it does because then
people could arbitrarily decide to

643
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:34,290
remove a leader and put a leader back in
and like you would just be able to vote

644
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,960
and change your mind with the tide like
constantly.

645
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,610
But that's one more reason why we
shouldn't have one person did stupid

646
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,240
should have,
first of all,

647
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,970
we got to,
we got to overhaul the way we teach

648
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:50,790
kids.
We've got to have more informed people.

649
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,740
Then once you have more informed people,
you let them in on what the fuck we

650
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,240
should do.
And we all decided as a group,

651
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,040
like the way they do it now,
right.

652
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,780
The way they do it now,
it's just,

653
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,920
it's,
it's bullshit.

654
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:03,900
It's fake.
Like you're pretending that you have a

655
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:04,890
choice.
You do have a choice.

656
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,300
You have a choice between this guy or
that guy,

657
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:07,920
neither one you like,
so pick it.

658
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:12,270
But both of them are embedded in all of
the special interest groups and all the

659
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:14,220
lobbyists and was supposed to be a
republic.

660
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,470
It was always supposed to be about the
people.

661
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,640
Yeah,
and by the people.

662
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,080
For the people who know I don't.
Yeah,

663
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,610
it's,
it's been cooptive by money.

664
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:24,540
It's real simple.
Big Pharma and all companies,

665
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,351
I don't know.
Well,

666
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:28,860
the amount of people that are allowed to
spend millions and millions of dollars

667
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:30,480
to prop up politicians.
It's like,

668
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,930
why would we let that happen on both
sides,

669
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:35,460
sides,
both sides.

670
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,130
Why would we let that happen?
That seems crazy.

671
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:43,131
That seems like any other job where you
were in a position of influence over

672
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,730
someone else's job,
you wouldn't be able to take money from

673
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:50,790
that person to make sure that you did
the right thing.

674
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,890
That would be called bribery.
Right.

675
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,230
I don't know what I mean,
it is like bribery.

676
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,970
They do it right.
They do do it,

677
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,490
but they get in be like,
here's the one that they get in real big

678
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:01,170
trouble for.
Here's one that I think is interesting.

679
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,580
They um,
trump recently did something about

680
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:07,620
steel,
about uh,

681
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,490
bringing steel back the United States
and steel manufacturing back in United

682
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:11,730
States.

683
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,020
But before he did it,
one of his homeys bought a shit load of

684
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:19,080
stock could steal like one of his,
like super rich dudes.

685
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,790
And so then the question is like,
hey,

686
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:23,820
should he have been allowed to do that?
Isn't that insider trading?

687
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,200
And you're like,
wait a minute.

688
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,780
You can't just know shit.
If I know shit,

689
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:29,640
what am I supposed to do?
I'm not supposed to buy stock.

690
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,270
Like,
well then if you do no shit and you buy

691
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,380
stock,
is that fair?

692
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,440
I didn't seem fair.
What's the answer there?

693
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:42,280
The answer is the system sucks.
You got a wacky fucking crazy system

694
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,490
that all your monies based on who people
could just buy and say,

695
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,550
sell parts of companies or all or all
Chinese pretty much bought all the steel

696
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,610
companies,
right?

697
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,250
It's a world by,
they were smart enough to say,

698
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:54,941
Oh,
you don't want that.

699
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:56,950
Okay.
Nobody's ever going to go back though.

700
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,390
Once you can make money off the stock
market.

701
00:29:58,391 --> 00:30:00,220
Fuck that.
I'm making money off moving numbers

702
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:01,780
around on my computer.
Fuck you.

703
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:04,140
I'm staying.
Do you play it now?

704
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,800
It's just terrifying.
Terrifying.

705
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,940
No Way.
No.

706
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,650
Get the fuck out of here.
With that,

707
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,500
I've,
I've have gained and lost before I was a

708
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:14,440
victim of a pump and dump scheme.
I get nervous at the wheel of fortune

709
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:16,150
dollar slots,
man in Vegas.

710
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:17,520
You know what I mean?
Much less shit.

711
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,050
It display.
Okay.

712
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,950
They lure you in.
I'm down 19.

713
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,110
I've got to get the fuck Outta here.

714
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,370
You know,
I was a victim of a pump and dump

715
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,380
scheme.
Um,

716
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,930
this dude told me to buy the stock and
he's like,

717
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:30,160
dude,
I'm telling you this talks about to blow

718
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,030
up.
The guy was a coke dealer,

719
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:33,400
so I knew he was honest,
trustworthy,

720
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,323
easy,
listened to,

721
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,070
right.
I didn't know he's a coke dealer at the

722
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:38,800
time.
I just thought he was a comic and so he

723
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:40,930
would tell me about the stock and we
bought into it.

724
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,770
I don't think I bought that much,
but it was like a few thousand dollars,

725
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,930
which is not that big of a deal if
you're a,

726
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,510
you know,
looking at the greater spectrum of how

727
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:50,910
much money people lose.
Right.

728
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,630
In the stock market,
that's a g I lost nothing.

729
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,410
I mean people lose their whole,
their whole life savings,

730
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:57,880
their fortune,
they're there.

731
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,340
What they've inherited,
people can lose it like that in the

732
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:01,090
stock market.

733
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,630
So we bought in,
me and my business manager and it went

734
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:07,090
out for a little while.
It went up because more people were

735
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:09,760
telling more people to buy it and then
it just crashed.

736
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,610
And when I mean it crashed,
it just went to the floor.

737
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:15,100
Like it didn't exist anymore.
It was like,

738
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,290
it went from,
I forget what the number was,

739
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,380
but it was like in the many dollars down
to like a fraction of a cent or a

740
00:31:22,411 --> 00:31:24,130
center,
three San or something like that.

741
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,370
It went down to virtually worthless.
And we're like,

742
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,540
oh,
we've got pumped and dumped.

743
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,050
Like that's what they do.
They,

744
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,080
they pump it up,
they get a bunch of people to join and

745
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:34,150
then once beach,
a bunch of people are buying this stock.

746
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:38,170
They're like abandon ship.
And I got fucked.

747
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,950
I remember shooter going on years ago of
all what the bitcoin shit man.

748
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,320
Yeah.
You got hung up on the bitcoin for a

749
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:44,510
minute.
Oh,

750
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,630
she loves it.
We,

751
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,910
I listen.
He loves that Shit.

752
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,770
He,
he's um,

753
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,890
he's a a bitcoin believer.
Yup.

754
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,780
I'm a bitcoin.
Hmm.

755
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,810
Hmm.
This isn't me.

756
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,710
I'm like,
I don't understand that and I probably

757
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,720
never will,
so I'm going to stay over here.

758
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,310
Yeah.
It's a good move.

759
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:08,670
I just every
like a little pyramid schemey does it,

760
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,890
I don't know.
I mean it's,

761
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:13,510
it's nervous.
It makes us nervous at this point in my

762
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:15,520
life.
I just assume everything is a pyramid

763
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:17,770
scheme.
It's always like a trickle of,

764
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,840
you know?
Yeah.

765
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,910
If it could be proven to be as stable or
more stable than money,

766
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,720
I think we just go for it.
That's what I think.

767
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,190
I think why fuck around.
Why?

768
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:35,191
Why use all these old crazy rich banker
dude's money when you could just do nerd

769
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:40,570
money is digital nerd money.
We'd all booed.

770
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,380
Take is people having to agree to it.
Right.

771
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,390
That's,
that's all it would take if everybody

772
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:45,800
just agreed to just use bitcoin

773
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,030
or if everybody agreed to an implant
that had all your info on it and all

774
00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:51,900
your,
your money,

775
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,810
don't you do that storage cool.
Walking to your movie,

776
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:56,250
man.
You know that's coming.

777
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:58,920
Yeah.
Someone's going to give you the benefits

778
00:32:58,921 --> 00:33:00,390
of it.
If you just put this in your Dick.

779
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,520
Well first of all,
it just,

780
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,810
they just have it inserted it.
Yeah,

781
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:04,300
but we all have one,
you know?

782
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,120
Yeah.
They haven't turned it on.

783
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,480
It's in your pocket and not your wrist.
Well,

784
00:33:09,481 --> 00:33:12,870
some people it's on the rest too.
I was who I was texting one night with

785
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:15,370
the guys in the band.
This was what really scared to show me

786
00:33:15,371 --> 00:33:19,860
where I like I got off social media
while back completely again.

787
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:20,760
I tried twitter,
Ghana,

788
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,620
I told Jason Isabel would give it a
second shot,

789
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:25,290
but I realize my kids are way more
interesting and like I'm trying to,

790
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,970
you know,
I just rather be writing a song or doing

791
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:27,804
something else.

792
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,250
But one night all we were all had a
group text going on and somebody said

793
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:34,730
something made a joke like,
uh,

794
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:39,180
it was a lot of 80s film buffs in our
band and somebody made a John Claude van

795
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,820
Damme reference and doodling and five
minutes later,

796
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:45,200
I'm not in any way exaggerating this,
all my wife and I are sitting and

797
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:48,030
watching TV,
surfing netflix and instantly it's like

798
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:52,620
my entire channel is full of John Claude
van Damme selections.

799
00:33:52,621 --> 00:33:54,420
And I was just like,
what in the fuck is going on?

800
00:33:54,421 --> 00:33:58,470
I've never watched the jock cluff and
damn film ever on Netflix.

801
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:02,160
And now there's all this,
it's like somehow that got cross

802
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:06,570
marketed to my television set just cause
I'm on my telephone and talking about

803
00:34:06,571 --> 00:34:09,140
this fucking guy freaked me out,
man.

804
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:09,983
I was like,
no more.

805
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,390
I'm dumping everything,
Dude.

806
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,020
I've heard people tell them weird dude.
They were having conversations on the

807
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:18,410
phone with someone and then what they
were talking about showed up in their

808
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:22,430
google ads on there on their laptop.
How's that work?

809
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,710
How does that work?
I have no idea what they listening

810
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,640
constantly.
Sometimes he says,

811
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,920
yes,
Edward Snowden says yes,

812
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,650
but that,
but the fact that it shows up in your

813
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:36,290
Google ads.
Isn't that a little fucking obvious?

814
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,810
I mean that hasn't happened to me.
Do you think that's real?

815
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,900
A hundred percent a hundred percent
Jamie's looking at Lee,

816
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,420
he looks like he should have a guy
fawkes mask on right now.

817
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,940
Slip on one of them fucking anarchist
masks.

818
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,030
Look at him.
He's smiling over there 100% they're

819
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:51,710
listening to us.
Goddammit.

820
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,380
Cheat meals free for a reason.
You know,

821
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,940
Ooh,
boom.

822
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,910
What's the read it definitely.
Yeah,

823
00:34:57,911 --> 00:34:59,540
they're reading everything.
Wow.

824
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,620
It all makes sense.
Now.

825
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,480
Now I'm freaking out,
Jamie.

826
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,880
Thanks.
Thanks buddy.

827
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,540
Hey,
fuck my head up man.

828
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,423
Here to help.

829
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,520
Is that okay?
You know who signed off on that?

830
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,160
How many people have ever read those
terms of agreement?

831
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,910
I don't have you ever the fifth thing,
that's what I think you're,

832
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,280
when you buy the Alexa,
you're just like,

833
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,440
yes,
go say you're buying.

834
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:26,090
Yet.
Those people are crazy.

835
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,880
Having those things in your house that
you talk to and it listens to

836
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:30,830
everything.
Fuck all that.

837
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,970
That just seems like too hackable.
So weird man.

838
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,380
It's getting,
and by the way,

839
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:40,380
this is just the first drops of water
that's going through before our roof

840
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:42,060
collapses because it's,
it's,

841
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,210
it's coming.
We know all cars now are more bills.

842
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,630
It's all in electronic systems and GPS.
Yeah.

843
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,710
I'm not a techie guy,
so excuse me if this is a really

844
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:54,600
ignorant question,
but like what's to stop somebody from

845
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:57,300
hacking into your car and crashing you
until fucking wall was,

846
00:35:57,301 --> 00:36:00,950
that was always the case against Michael
or the death of against the definitely

847
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:01,860
guy that he's tasted.

848
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,703
The CA.
Yeah.

849
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:03,803
Yeah,
I remember that.

850
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,980
Well.
They don't know if the CIA or who are

851
00:36:05,981 --> 00:36:06,814
all,
you know,

852
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,990
but he wrote a story for rolling stone.
He was embedded in Iraq or Afghanistan,

853
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,580
I forget.
And he wrote a story about this general,

854
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:18,750
it was very unflattering.
And what happened was he got stuck there

855
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:21,600
with them and he lived with these people
for a long time and they let their guard

856
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:23,010
down.
And uh,

857
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,660
you know,
they said a bunch shit they would say

858
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:26,220
around each other.
They made a movie about it today.

859
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,750
I don't know,
do they?

860
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,720
I don't know.
I don't know about that.

861
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,670
Maybe they might've,
but this general,

862
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,560
uh,
apparently got fired and it was one of

863
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:36,750
the best generals that,
you know,

864
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,080
it was very highly ranked and I'm really
respected by the troops and people were

865
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:44,910
really,
really pissed at this guy.

866
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,530
And,
um,

867
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:51,420
he was starting to say that he was in
danger and that his life was in danger.

868
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:56,820
And I think even said something about if
for whatever reason he commit suicide

869
00:36:56,821 --> 00:36:59,180
that he didn't do it.
And,

870
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,720
um,
he was driving his car and he drove

871
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,480
straight into a treat over a hundred
miles an hour,

872
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,050
I think it was on sunset.
It's car exploded,

873
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,030
um,
engine flew from the car,

874
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:17,010
like crazy horrific shit.
And then afterwards they talked to these

875
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,870
computer experts and they say,
well,

876
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:23,490
is it possible to take a modern
automobile with all sorts of,

877
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,120
there's all sorts of devices inside
modern cars,

878
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,340
right?
That makes them hit the brakes.

879
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:32,910
If you're getting too close to something
or literally move out of a lane,

880
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,290
some of them have automatic pilot so you
could just fucking press the destination

881
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,030
and it just navigates there.
I mean,

882
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:42,300
that's what in Pittsburgh or was there
some weeks back?

883
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,240
Those are crazy.
If the self driving Uber's there and

884
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:46,890
they're getting better and better and
better at that.

885
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,123
Hmm,

886
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,860
let's,
I dunno,

887
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,290
I mean,
where do you go?

888
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,140
Next thing you know,
there'll be trying to shoot humans

889
00:37:59,141 --> 00:38:00,910
through pneumatic tubes or something,
you know,

890
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,040
but you think it's people who kill
people,

891
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,160
uh,
literally for a profession,

892
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,630
right?
Professional soldiers,

893
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,210
especially the ones that this guy mean
embedded in combat.

894
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,620
[inaudible] I don't think it's outside
the realm of possibility that they would

895
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:18,910
like that guy up for getting that
general booted out.

896
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,190
Right.
I don't think it's outside the realm of

897
00:38:21,191 --> 00:38:23,170
possibility at all.
They would think that guy is the enemy.

898
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,940
And they said that he had amphetamines
in his system and for awhile I was like,

899
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,050
oh,
yet amphetamines.

900
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:32,290
Maybe he's going crazy.
Then I realized that almost all

901
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,360
journalists are taken fucking adderall.
Right?

902
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,250
They're all taking,
you'll find it.

903
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,980
Amphetamines and methlick substantives
and all of them.

904
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,110
Not all of them don't get mad if you're
straight.

905
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,541
You're like,
dude,

906
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:44,020
all I drink his coffee.
Don't be a dick.

907
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:48,070
But a lot of them,
I have many friends that are writers or

908
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:50,800
journalists.
I can think of two journalists that are

909
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:52,990
friends of mine,
both take a lot out of Raleigh.

910
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:53,900
I love that shit.
Yeah.

911
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,970
Good Buddy of mine who's a doctor,
was just telling me that when he was in

912
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:00,190
college and he was going through,
uh,

913
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,240
all of examinations,
his friends started taking adderall and

914
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:07,300
he recognizes giant jump in their
performance and you're just like,

915
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:08,620
what the fuck?
He goes,

916
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:10,360
they were smoking me and the grades and
I realized,

917
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,060
Oh,
these guys are on pdds.

918
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,710
I never,
I never did it.

919
00:39:13,711 --> 00:39:14,750
I remember trying to,
uh,

920
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,410
want to try right now.
Not really together.

921
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:16,901
No,
I don't.

922
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:20,140
I'm,
I kind of like to be down here.

923
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,033
You know what I mean?
I don't,

924
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,270
I've never understood that.

925
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,850
Uh,
I guess it just never appealed to my

926
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:27,880
disposition.
I don't think I would function if you

927
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:30,580
wanted to build a log cabin right now,
right now,

928
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,570
might be the way to go.
Right.

929
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,330
Well,
they said when Jack Kerouac wrote on the

930
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:35,010
road,
he was,

931
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,940
uh,
they were on a lot of bins.

932
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,040
Adriene or like this snow and hail and
things.

933
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,740
They used to borrow them and he'll sit
down and wrote the whole thing and like

934
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:43,510
three days,
Jesus Christ,

935
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,850
maybe a day,
I can't remember the,

936
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,491
I don't,
you know,

937
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:47,950
I'm not a beat efficient auto,
but I know that he was,

938
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:51,790
hopped out of his mind on speed and
wrote the whole Dang thing.

939
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:55,870
Like in a scroll on a roof in Mexico
while Ginsburg was probably downstairs

940
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:57,640
molesting a little kid or some shit.
I don't know.

941
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,770
He's,
that's a dark picture,

942
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,813
right?

943
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:03,460
Yeah.

944
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,990
There used to be,
uh,

945
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,140
what do you got there Jamie?
How a generation of beat writers burnt

946
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:08,974
out on speed.

947
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,413
Wow.

948
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:16,090
There was a big pool scene
back then.

949
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,530
Yeah,
that's what I was going to say.

950
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:19,900
There's pool players.
That was the,

951
00:40:19,901 --> 00:40:22,360
uh,
the thing with pool players back then is

952
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:23,260
that they would,
uh,

953
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,550
take speed and gamble people.
When people first found out about speed,

954
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:31,090
it must have been the most amazing thing
ever before they realize like how it can

955
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:33,280
wreck you.
How many think about there's no speed.

956
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,080
And then all of a sudden,
10,

957
00:40:35,081 --> 00:40:36,880
20 years later,
everyone's on speed.

958
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,680
I mean,
it happened out of nowhere.

959
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:42,040
There wasn't a bunch of speed burnouts
that everybody could like look back on

960
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:42,371
and go,
oh,

961
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:44,350
look at that guy over there,
learn from him.

962
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:47,170
Like,
especially like adderall.

963
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:49,690
Like there's no,
there's no burnouts.

964
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,750
So everybody's would just been taking it
for a few years ago.

965
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,030
Has it been around 20 years?
As long as,

966
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,860
uh,
how long thing adderall has been around

967
00:40:56,861 --> 00:40:58,450
Jamie.
Yeah,

968
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:00,040
probably it after Ritalin probably,
right.

969
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:00,730
So,
yeah,

970
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,020
15,
15,

971
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,510
20 years.
It was invented at the same time as

972
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:05,344
gluten.

973
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,980
Kara whack took so much amphetamine
amphetamine when he first discovered the

974
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:15,400
inhaler high that he lost most of his
hair and his legs swelled up with,

975
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:20,850
what does that worth?
Thrombo flebbe Bitas thrombo phlebitis

976
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,400
wow,
that's,

977
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,600
that seems like you went overboard a
little bit.

978
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,533
Say.
Anyway,

979
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,050
he went deep,
you know.

980
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:32,290
Um,
do you know who that a beardie man guy

981
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:35,270
is?
Does a electronic music?

982
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,600
It was like one of those,
what do they call those m artists?

983
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:40,550
Would they call them Edm,
Edm,

984
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,060
all those,
you know,

985
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,550
those fellows,
he's got a beard,

986
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,050
but he,
uh,

987
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,710
Greg Fitzsimmons and I were going over a
hunter s Thompson's routine before he

988
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:49,544
would,
uh,

989
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,880
write and he would just start off like
early in the morning,

990
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:56,120
drinking a whole laundry list,
bleeding until start work at midnight.

991
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,350
It's midnight.
Hunters Thompson is ready to ride.

992
00:41:58,351 --> 00:41:59,600
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

993
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:00,771
And,
but him,

994
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,900
same thing right in his body just gave
out man,

995
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:05,240
his body was just falling apart by the
time he's tired.

996
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,460
He just burnt that fucking thing to a
crisp.

997
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,150
Well,
they didn't know what we know now down.

998
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:10,880
You know,
they were,

999
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,730
those guys were riding the lightning and
they,

1000
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,510
they never thought there'd be any,
yeah.

1001
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:17,810
But I think with hunter,
it didn't matter whether or not he knew

1002
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:19,760
he had done this exact same thing
anyway.

1003
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:24,800
Like he,
he was of a mindset that he's just like,

1004
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,200
he's not here for a long time.
He's here for a good time.

1005
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,510
Right.
And that's what he did.

1006
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,771
And this,
I mean,

1007
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:33,080
that's why people love that guy.
It's one of the main,

1008
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:34,730
not just because of his brilliant
writing,

1009
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,310
but because that mother fucker went for
it.

1010
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,620
And then when it was all over,
he said,

1011
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:40,910
yeah,
the same fun anymore.

1012
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,920
You take care,
put a gun to his head.

1013
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,560
And that's a wrap.
Told everybody who's going to do it to

1014
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,790
said,
hey,

1015
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,640
I want to get to a point where I don't
like this anymore.

1016
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,180
I got fake hips now.
Can't move always in pain.

1017
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,640
That's a wrap.
Take care,

1018
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,390
boom.
The second you can't walk up or down a

1019
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:01,880
few flights of stairs by herself.
That's kind of when it's over.

1020
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:02,930
You know,
for a lot of people,

1021
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:05,900
you know,
a lot of people manage to still find

1022
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:08,180
some reason to keep going and enjoy
themselves and,

1023
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,280
and you know,
and they're fine,

1024
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:16,090
but it's like when you're a guy that's
just still hit it hard every day,

1025
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,070
he never got,
he never sobered up.

1026
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,490
There was no sobering up at high watch.
So what point though,

1027
00:43:21,491 --> 00:43:24,560
is that sad?
Yeah.

1028
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,020
When is it,
I mean there's obviously a pretty

1029
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,620
inherent level of self medication going
on to,

1030
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,510
to get through the day so you don't wake
up and blow your brains out.

1031
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,373
Right.
You know?

1032
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,300
Yeah.
Um,

1033
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,440
maybe it was just me.
I don't know.

1034
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,920
Um,
I think with a guy like him,

1035
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,720
his,
his path was probably pretty clearly

1036
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:53,470
carved from the time he was very young.
He just,

1037
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,560
he wa,
I mean,

1038
00:43:56,561 --> 00:44:00,190
the thing that's so interesting about
him and said he was so genuinely

1039
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,670
thoughtful,
like you really did think about it as

1040
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,880
one of the greatest writers of our time.
The questions I'm and a Kentucky and so,

1041
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,733
yeah,
there you go.

1042
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,760
It's gotta be all right.
Yeah,

1043
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,270
I read a lot of it,
but I read it way too early because you

1044
00:44:13,271 --> 00:44:13,780
know,
in your,

1045
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,790
I was one of those kids got just at
older cousins.

1046
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:18,790
You get exposed to all that shit.
It was too soon.

1047
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,870
You know,
probably high school.

1048
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:22,440
I went on to read,
uh,

1049
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,870
the,
the campaign trail thing.

1050
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,970
The Nixon book.
Yeah.

1051
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,770
Yeah.
That was a great one.

1052
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,520
His,
his documentary.

1053
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,390
You ever say that Gonzo lifetimes of
fucking amazing.

1054
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,980
Yeah.
You want to just do something with your

1055
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:41,940
life after you wash that?
Not to,

1056
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,700
I don't know.
I don't have any friends that like way

1057
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:47,940
44 magnums around in their living room
though.

1058
00:44:47,941 --> 00:44:49,020
It's not good.
You're right.

1059
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:52,260
100%.
He definitely want to go to that party.

1060
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,300
Don't get me wrong.
I go to that party too,

1061
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:56,340
but you might get shot.
I wouldn't move in.

1062
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,380
No,
no,

1063
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,060
no.
You go to the party.

1064
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,280
Johnny Depp moved in for like what,
six weeks?

1065
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,180
All the way they went.
They went her head too though.

1066
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,830
I wonder if he cooked Johnny Depp's
brain.

1067
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,470
I wonder if that's when giant deb
started going wacky.

1068
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:11,850
Holy Shit.
It probably is.

1069
00:45:11,851 --> 00:45:13,410
I'm going to spread it.
Conspiracy theory.

1070
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:18,120
Jai Dep was reasonable and calm and
polite and had his shit completely

1071
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:22,710
together until he did too much acid with
hunter s thompson and that's why he's

1072
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:23,544
wacky now.

1073
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,530
When you think,
I don't know,

1074
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,480
it's not outside the realm of
possibility Kentucky too,

1075
00:45:27,481 --> 00:45:29,940
so I'm not going to say damn,
it's a full Kentucky House.

1076
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,660
Did you ever read the Kentucky Derby is
decadent and depraved?

1077
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,190
Yeah,
absolutely.

1078
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,500
And it's,
and it still holds true.

1079
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,850
Oh,
it's an amazing book.

1080
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,020
Are Amazing article rather.
Well that was,

1081
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:43,170
that was where he sorta really found the
style.

1082
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:45,810
That piece in particular was where it
was like,

1083
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:48,450
I'm going to go over here and do this.
Yeah,

1084
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,420
there was definitely that.
And then that fear and loathing in Las

1085
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,490
Vegas thing to where that started out,
he was pink,

1086
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:58,491
paid to cover a motorcycle race.
It became this just fucking crazy screed

1087
00:45:58,501 --> 00:46:02,580
about drugs and partying and we're
outside of Barstow when the drugs began

1088
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:07,530
to take hold and it's fucking bad to the
air and shit that driving a convertible

1089
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:10,020
cadillac across the country headed to
Vegas.

1090
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,840
I mean it's a fucking amazing,
amazing piece of work.

1091
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,440
And it started out as a sports
illustrated story.

1092
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,410
They wanted him to cover race and also a
very,

1093
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,780
you know,
fitting and beautiful eulogy to the

1094
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:26,000
whole sixties flower power shift that
just caved on itself.

1095
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,480
Yeah.
Does that one line to fucking quitters

1096
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:31,770
man?
Well,

1097
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,440
what do you think happened with them?
I think they took away their pot,

1098
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,130
I think took away the acid and they
arrested a bunch of people and they

1099
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:39,840
don't want to clamp down.
And then,

1100
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:41,040
you know,
you have a few

1101
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,110
calls through massacres and uh,
you know,

1102
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,410
the,
the sensationalization of the Manson

1103
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:51,470
murders probably didn't help.
Right.

1104
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,930
I'm sure it became like a big narrative.
Hippies,

1105
00:46:54,931 --> 00:46:57,470
LSD Martinson.
Yeah,

1106
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,730
it was all all tied in.
Um,

1107
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,660
but you know,
the musically since I should stick to

1108
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,340
talking about things I know about,
which is music,

1109
00:47:05,341 --> 00:47:09,420
I think that that was probably just the
best shit that ever happened.

1110
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:14,421
It never will happen like that 65 to 70
there was,

1111
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,070
it just sort of exploded in all
different directions and a lot of things

1112
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:24,120
happen that maybe they couldn't happen
now or even two decades ago.

1113
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:25,650
They couldn't have happened as a
musician.

1114
00:47:25,651 --> 00:47:29,350
What do you think was the catalyst?
Like what made them go from the 50 sound

1115
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:30,184
to the sixties

1116
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,150
just experimentation and,
and mind,

1117
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:35,950
whatever,
you know,

1118
00:47:35,951 --> 00:47:40,110
looking for different ways of life.
Philosophically speaking,

1119
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,930
maybe.
I think what they're all writing about

1120
00:47:41,931 --> 00:47:42,730
it,
but I mean,

1121
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,970
and then some guys were just pushing the
sonic limitations of the studio.

1122
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:49,060
Like Hendrix didn't really do that much
drugs,

1123
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:51,070
you know what I mean?
The guy was all just about like,

1124
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:51,671
I mean,
yeah,

1125
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:53,890
he partied,
but he wasn't like a Druggie,

1126
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,580
you know,
he probably ate acid on stage a couple

1127
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:58,390
times in both of those.
I think he was spiked.

1128
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,531
Really?
Yeah.

1129
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:01,420
And the dude,
he's just a serious blues head and they

1130
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:06,190
wanted to stretch out and uh,
really pushed what the limitations of

1131
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:08,210
the gear at that time in the studio,
you know?

1132
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:09,911
Well,
I don't,

1133
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:11,500
I don't only want to have eight
channels.

1134
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:12,640
What would,
if we had 16,

1135
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,550
I'll you have some of the
experimentation things that guys like

1136
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:18,910
him and pink floyd and uh,
later bands,

1137
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,753
you know,
alo,

1138
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:24,490
just really pushing the parameters of
what you could do with a traditional

1139
00:48:24,491 --> 00:48:28,540
style of music in terms of arrangement
and how you frame that.

1140
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:32,460
I always assumed that because he got
arrested in Toronto with heroin,

1141
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,270
that he did drugs.
I feel like if you have heroin on you,

1142
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,920
you got drunk.
Did he get busted for,

1143
00:48:37,921 --> 00:48:40,260
I thought it was barbiturates are just
good question.

1144
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,510
I'm pretty sure it was heroin.
I don't think he ever like,

1145
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,800
I could be wrong,
man.

1146
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:45,120
It might be right.
You might be right.

1147
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,510
What does it say?
It says a small amount of heroin and

1148
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,690
hashish
chasing the dragon.

1149
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,740
Yeah.
See.

1150
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,180
So when I read that,
I'm like,

1151
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,270
hmm,
how much do we know about what Jimmy

1152
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,010
Hendrix did during his day?
Like you don't know how high I'm

1153
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:01,590
getting.
I know a of how would they,

1154
00:49:01,591 --> 00:49:02,424
how would they know?
I mean,

1155
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:05,850
if they see us get high on the show,
they know all high I got today.

1156
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,170
Right.
But they don't even,

1157
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,030
because I could get high before I go
running.

1158
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,190
I might get high when I'm sitting home
to write.

1159
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,780
I have people telling me that I'm high
when I'm not even higher.

1160
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,250
Yeah,
but you probably are a little still.

1161
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,290
He's really sleepy.

1162
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:21,810
Be Like Hound dog guys who'll,
I'll always look harder.

1163
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:22,820
Even something,
but whatever.

1164
00:49:22,821 --> 00:49:23,960
It doesn't matter.
Um,

1165
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,180
Jimmy,
Jimmy liked,

1166
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,240
he wasn't as some weird shit.
It's kind of a,

1167
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:33,740
I know he had this thing about video
filming women walking away from the

1168
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:36,840
hotel.
I said they found this big collection of

1169
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:40,360
like home movies of him hanging out off
hotel room balconies.

1170
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:44,780
Like they walked away,
walk as they walked away with some kind

1171
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,970
of weird,
interesting fetish.

1172
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,670
What does that,
he was not guilty on the charges.

1173
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:52,100
They don't know that they might've been
planted on him.

1174
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,240
Oh,
interesting.

1175
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:54,860
They're not sure if they're interested.
Mustang.

1176
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:58,170
Interesting.
It said he had no drug partner for

1177
00:49:58,171 --> 00:50:00,630
Nellie in his luggage or needle tracks
on his arms.

1178
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,890
No,
he smoked pot,

1179
00:50:01,891 --> 00:50:04,580
but he doesn't know.
They might have fucking frame.

1180
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:09,360
Damn that dude.
That dude was too creative and prolific

1181
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,420
just in the amount of time he was alive
to have been a junkie.

1182
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:13,470
You know what I mean?
Like yeah,

1183
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,610
you gotta you gotta make a junkie get up
and do shit.

1184
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:20,280
That's true.
But they say that about potheads too.

1185
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,620
But I know a lot of pretty prolific
potheads.

1186
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,210
I don't buy that.
I don't either.

1187
00:50:24,211 --> 00:50:26,070
Smoking pot gets me off the couch.
Yeah,

1188
00:50:26,071 --> 00:50:27,150
right.
It makes it a little paranoid.

1189
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,031
Totally.
Yeah.

1190
00:50:28,031 --> 00:50:30,830
Like I got to get some shit,
you know,

1191
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,680
like I'm maybe not working hard enough.
It makes me feel like that.

1192
00:50:33,681 --> 00:50:35,960
Like I could be getting more shit done.
Yeah.

1193
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,590
They said linen actually and I want,
and he was on heroin for a while,

1194
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,680
but that motherfucker laid in bed with
like 18 cats,

1195
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,660
you know,
and it didn't do anything.

1196
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,160
And then they said Paul would be like,
Oh,

1197
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:47,690
I've got some songs.
We've got to make a record.

1198
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:48,620
And He'd be like,
God damn it,

1199
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,600
wake up and have to write five songs in
a week.

1200
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,110
Oh really?
Cause he just released.

1201
00:50:52,111 --> 00:50:56,600
So he just lay around like a sloth butt
naked until all the,

1202
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:00,290
all the maids to pretend like he wasn't
there when he walks through the kitchen

1203
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:02,390
naked.
Get a glass of milk.

1204
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,910
You couldn't do that anymore.
They take your house.

1205
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,670
That needs to be fired.
You couldn't even make it like an

1206
00:51:07,671 --> 00:51:08,271
arrangement.
Well,

1207
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:09,710
you can't make an arrangement the other
way though.

1208
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,740
There's like a top was made service to
come over your house and they'd take

1209
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:13,760
their top off.
See,

1210
00:51:13,761 --> 00:51:15,560
that just seems weird.
It's definitely weird.

1211
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:16,550
I don't know.
I would be like,

1212
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,570
imagine the people that those poor
ladies have to deal with on a daily

1213
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:21,250
fuck,
man.

1214
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,400
Yeah,
that ain't a good time.

1215
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,520
But um,
you could have a topless maid service,

1216
00:51:25,521 --> 00:51:29,270
but you couldn't have a,
you come over and wash the house while

1217
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:32,570
I'm naked deal.
Because if it's your house and you're

1218
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:33,890
naked and they're walking around your
house,

1219
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,110
then you're forcing them to look at you
naked.

1220
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,840
Right.
I would think that that's,

1221
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,540
yeah.
People are losing their careers over

1222
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:41,720
there right now.
Yeah.

1223
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:43,220
You can't really not supposed to do
that.

1224
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,600
Yeah,
but in the old days,

1225
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:48,420
like a king who didn't give a fuck,
he would just stroll around and let

1226
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,380
everyone look at his cock and walk right
through the fucking building.

1227
00:51:51,381 --> 00:51:54,230
Wouldn't give a shit.
Have Your Head Cup Cup chopped off if

1228
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:57,050
you didn't have sex with him.
I would not want to live in those times.

1229
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,690
I've been watching a lot of vikings.
I would seen it,

1230
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:01,190
man.
I feel like for people telling me to

1231
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:02,990
watch that shit,
I don't have time.

1232
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,450
I didn't believe them.
I didn't believe them.

1233
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,340
I'm like,
there's no way it's on regular tv cause

1234
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:08,570
it that good.
It's fucking good.

1235
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,530
Really.
It's a good shot.

1236
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,990
You,
you have to get through the first couple

1237
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,950
episodes.
First couple episodes,

1238
00:52:12,951 --> 00:52:16,370
you're a little bit like wet and yeah,
my buddy forgot all about it.

1239
00:52:16,371 --> 00:52:16,711
He's like,
man,

1240
00:52:16,711 --> 00:52:18,330
you got to get on his bike Vikas.
Damn man,

1241
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,540
they have to set things up.
That's the problem with shows.

1242
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,760
You're not,
you're a little skeptical until you get

1243
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:26,270
to know everybody and then you get the
feeling of the characters and then you

1244
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:28,790
get sucked in.
That's why binge watching it so awesome.

1245
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,820
Like it is watching is great for if
you're,

1246
00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:34,430
especially if you're a touring musician.
Oh go so right.

1247
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,830
You know,
I can never get into shows when they

1248
00:52:36,831 --> 00:52:39,680
come out because I'll see a couple of
episodes and then we go on tour for two

1249
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:41,960
months and you're like,
what the fuck happened?

1250
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,970
But now I can come home and just,
you know,

1251
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:49,370
watch a season of something in a day
while I'm recuperating.

1252
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,350
Yeah.
My wife's pretty,

1253
00:52:51,351 --> 00:52:53,450
she knows what like good.
There's good shows,

1254
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:54,930
the programs and shit.
Like I don't have,

1255
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,710
I wouldn't know what to watch,
but I've found a lot of things.

1256
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:01,100
Have you seen stranger things?
I saw the first season or no,

1257
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:01,791
I did see that.
Yeah,

1258
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:06,230
we saw those.
What about Ozark saw that?

1259
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,670
I like,
I like Bateman.

1260
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,070
That's good.
I like that sort of Donek Shit.

1261
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:14,370
There's a new one coming out with jared
leto but the code,

1262
00:53:14,371 --> 00:53:16,010
is it a movie?
It's a movie.

1263
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,560
It's a movie on Netflix.
Yeah.

1264
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,850
You joins the Yakuza most handsomest
white looking Kusa guy ever

1265
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,590
perfect.
Right?

1266
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,380
Because that happens all the time.
It's happening in this movie,

1267
00:53:28,381 --> 00:53:29,340
Bro.
How about spend?

1268
00:53:29,341 --> 00:53:31,770
A little disbelief for jared or less
walking around.

1269
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,090
She Shinjuku looking for white dudes to
fucking run shop.

1270
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,950
You know,
I think he's learned how to speak

1271
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:40,140
Japanese.
I hope so.

1272
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:42,540
It's gonna be pretty weird if you've
done beautiful.

1273
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,510
He's prettier than most women.
Oh,

1274
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:46,740
he's pretty than a lot of women,
man.

1275
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:48,090
If you put him on like a long

1276
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:52,120
hair wig type situation,
it's beautiful.

1277
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,673
There it goes.

1278
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:57,180
We go on and look at pictures of Jesse
supposed to be half Japanese.

1279
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,310
I think he's supposed to be her misses a
show.

1280
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:02,280
I better not be cause he's got his hair
do that anymore.

1281
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:05,310
That shit is cultural appropriation.
You're not allowed to anymore.

1282
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,090
But how else was the white dudes going
to get you Kusa he's gotta be,

1283
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:11,940
he's gotta be like a catch there.
I think he was a soldier that was

1284
00:54:11,941 --> 00:54:14,190
friends with a guy stayed over there to
help them.

1285
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:17,160
Gotcha.
If you have a movie today and you have a

1286
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:19,980
Chinese character in the movie,
but you have a Japanese guy play the

1287
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:21,660
Chinese character,
you're fucked.

1288
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,000
Right.
People will get angry.

1289
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,230
You can't do it anymore.

1290
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:31,530
No more pretending you're someone else.
Like can you like if you lost your

1291
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:35,010
Robert Downey Jr yeah,
he could get away with it,

1292
00:54:35,011 --> 00:54:37,320
but not anymore.
He got away with it and that one movie.

1293
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,140
But like if you were an Asian guy
though,

1294
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:44,700
I firmly believe no one would have a
problem if they took an Asian guy and

1295
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:48,210
gave him some sort of facial prosthetics
that turned him into a European looking

1296
00:54:48,211 --> 00:54:53,010
guy and then gave him lead roles and a
movie where he plays a European guy,

1297
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,470
people would have to shut the fuck up.
They'd be,

1298
00:54:55,471 --> 00:54:58,760
they would want to say something within,
they'd go,

1299
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,840
it's amazing how far,
uh,

1300
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:03,640
we,
we watch old movies on,

1301
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,270
on the bus sometimes.
And I want,

1302
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,800
if I'm at home and my,
and I'm by myself,

1303
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:11,430
like I'll watch weird shit.
I'll like old films and a lot of old

1304
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:15,600
westerns and stuff and I'll watch the
same movies I've seen a hundred times

1305
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:17,760
over and over as opposed to watching a
lot of the newer shit.

1306
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,240
Um,
we do watch a lot of these old westerns

1307
00:55:21,241 --> 00:55:25,530
from the fifties and it's like,
it's all white dues painted up like

1308
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:29,940
native American Indians with the head
resident just looks so cheesy and they

1309
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:33,000
have these,
these have affected a horrible accents

1310
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:34,950
and you're just like,
how the fuck did that ever happen?

1311
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:39,420
But then you get to the eighties and you
watch something like 48 hours now and

1312
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:41,490
it's the most sexist,
racist,

1313
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:43,410
misogynistic shit.
Like,

1314
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:47,460
and they were just pumping those things
out of studios two or three decades ago.

1315
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,380
You know,
where they,

1316
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:53,640
any female characters in those films,
like you're either hooker one or

1317
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,880
secretary at precinct who everybody
dismisses.

1318
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:58,740
You know what I mean?
Like those were the only roles.

1319
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,090
Yeah,
that just happened.

1320
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,540
That's when we were kids.
Yeah.

1321
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:06,130
When we were kids.
Yeah,

1322
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,150
we were on that movie.
I would just call out specifically.

1323
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:10,900
We washed it on the bus one night.
We were all like,

1324
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:13,120
this would never fucking get made at
random.

1325
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,030
There's no way so much we'd never get
made.

1326
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,520
It's weird.
I mean,

1327
00:56:18,521 --> 00:56:20,380
is that,
is that cultural evolution?

1328
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,060
I think so.
I mean,

1329
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:23,650
I hope so.
There's a little bit of it,

1330
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:26,800
but it's happening.
It's not just like catchphrases and

1331
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:29,530
shit.
I hope it's actually doing something.

1332
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:31,390
I have weird ideas about this.

1333
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,223
Um,

1334
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:38,230
I really feel like if we weren't
completely embedded in it,

1335
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:43,380
that we would look at,
this is like a system that's pulling us

1336
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:45,120
into its web

1337
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:48,720
and,
and forcing us to be more and more

1338
00:56:48,721 --> 00:56:52,890
entangled in this system is the system
of electronics.

1339
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:57,600
It's like almost like it's,
it's preparing for us to give birth to

1340
00:56:57,601 --> 00:57:00,660
artificial life.
And so in the meantime,

1341
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:05,070
it's completely sucking us in and making
us be completely embedded.

1342
00:57:05,071 --> 00:57:06,600
Phone's in your pocket,
constant.

1343
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:08,610
Alexa,
listening to everything you do.

1344
00:57:08,611 --> 00:57:13,590
It's all just as deep as it can in the
biological systems world and pill.

1345
00:57:13,591 --> 00:57:16,740
It gives birth and we're going to force
it out of exist,

1346
00:57:16,741 --> 00:57:21,180
force it into existence just by being
completely fascinated with electronics.

1347
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,370
Are We?
I'm going to [inaudible].

1348
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,730
Yeah.
Is it the universe forcing it into

1349
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:26,880
exists that too.
I think it's a natural thing.

1350
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:28,830
Wow.
I've always described it as like a,

1351
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:31,200
it's figured out a way to interconnect
itself.

1352
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:32,940
You've been more man.
Yeah.

1353
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,980
It has data.
Yeah.

1354
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,920
And forced progress.
Like thinking about what they were

1355
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,810
saying about Putin,
like if Putin,

1356
00:57:39,811 --> 00:57:41,210
who really does have that later.

1357
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,750
So fucking Skynet,
man.

1358
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,170
It sure is.
Yeah,

1359
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:47,910
there you go.
But if someone has that kind of power,

1360
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:50,280
right?
If there really is something that a

1361
00:57:50,281 --> 00:57:53,640
person can think up that didn't exist
200 years ago,

1362
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,230
200 years ago,
that wasn't even the thought of it.

1363
00:57:55,530 --> 00:58:00,530
So in 200 years to small amounts of
measurement of time and relationship to

1364
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:04,230
the entire age of the universe,
they could figure out a way to kill

1365
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:09,231
every person on the planet like that
literally wreck the planet where no life

1366
00:58:09,661 --> 00:58:11,880
would be.
It wouldn't be possible to have life.

1367
00:58:11,881 --> 00:58:16,881
There's enough nuclear bombs to do that.
What is it going to be like in to 200

1368
00:58:18,051 --> 00:58:19,910
years from now?
It's going to be way,

1369
00:58:19,911 --> 00:58:20,451
way,
way,

1370
00:58:20,451 --> 00:58:21,830
way,
way more accelerated.

1371
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:25,220
Let's almost going to get to the point
where the universe

1372
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,080
is going to be a place where you could
visit.

1373
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:32,630
Like people can go places if not people.
Things can go go places.

1374
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:36,800
As long as I'm holding a lightsaber
before I die or you'll get one of those,

1375
00:58:36,801 --> 00:58:38,750
it's all fucking worth it.
But the problem,

1376
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,010
the light sabers,
I was always like,

1377
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:41,000
well,
why does it end there?

1378
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:43,380
Why doesn't it just go on for infinity?
Like a lazy boy?

1379
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:44,020
Yeah,
right.

1380
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,180
Why is it only three and a half feet
long now?

1381
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:49,790
What's he doing?
Unless it was a rod and then the laser

1382
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:52,010
went around the rob,
but it knew to stop at the top.

1383
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,460
That would make sense.
But the fact that laser only extends

1384
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:58,010
three feet or whatever it does the fuck
out of here.

1385
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:00,320
George Lucas was a big crew.
Saw a fan,

1386
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,310
was he?
Yeah.

1387
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:04,000
All that Shit's based on Samurai films.
Oh,

1388
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,190
that's right.
And Leona films and all those guys just

1389
00:59:07,191 --> 00:59:09,470
like,
it's like generations of dudes paying

1390
00:59:09,471 --> 00:59:11,840
homage and ripping each other off the
lead to the new thing.

1391
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,820
It's the same as music.
Wow.

1392
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:17,030
Well Quinn [inaudible] has always been
pretty open about that.

1393
00:59:17,031 --> 00:59:21,740
Right.
He makes unapologetic like cinematic is

1394
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:24,270
right down to framing shots and scores.
Like he's uh,

1395
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,930
yeah.
Does it masterfully though?

1396
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,590
Like it isn't it?
What are you doing when you remaking

1397
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,460
King Kong making money?
Yeah.

1398
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:33,980
You make your money,
you're making a lot of money,

1399
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,140
but if you do it right,
you,

1400
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,960
you see you're making art.
I don't think anybody has done King

1401
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,160
Kong.
Right.

1402
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,500
What is Donkey Kong?
You might not be able to do King Kong,

1403
00:59:41,501 --> 00:59:42,890
right?
Maybe it's a bad example,

1404
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,710
but the hug the CGI for me,
man,

1405
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:48,050
it really took the magic out of
everything that was hd.

1406
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:51,410
Cause you watch Harry and the Hendersons
with your kids now or something.

1407
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:54,680
And that looks better than a lot of the
stuff coming out.

1408
00:59:54,681 --> 00:59:55,670
It's just,
I don't know,

1409
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,690
is a suspension of disbelief isn't there
to hdtv just fucking ruined movies for

1410
00:59:59,691 --> 01:00:03,680
me cause I'm like,
yeah,

1411
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,990
give me some vhs.

1412
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,610
You know,
it's better.

1413
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,380
Blur the lines a little bit.
Yeah.

1414
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,180
Like digital music.
Same thing here.

1415
01:00:11,181 --> 01:00:16,181
All that separation and air and uh,
sterilization,

1416
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:20,720
I guess is the best way to put it.
I think it definitely works that way for

1417
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:21,950
physical things.
Like,

1418
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,710
it's one of the reasons why the original
alien movie was so terrifying.

1419
01:00:24,711 --> 01:00:27,230
It was a physical thing.
Fucking that was a,

1420
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:29,600
you knew where the first Halloween,
yeah,

1421
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:34,250
there was no blood in that film.
It's just tension and thread and real

1422
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:38,840
dialogue and real people and some crazy
fuck running around in a William Shatner

1423
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:41,810
mask,
even American Werewolf in London.

1424
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:44,060
So quick.
Also from Kentucky.

1425
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,410
Why is he really,
Yup.

1426
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:48,980
Damn Kentucky.
And Muhammad Ali.

1427
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,240
Yeah.
We don't fuck a Louisville.

1428
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,890
Yeah.
My Ingraham Lincoln,

1429
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:55,120
Daniel Boon dam,
uh,

1430
01:00:55,970 --> 01:01:00,470
Harry Still Harry Dean Stanton.
Imagine the Daniel Boone days.

1431
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:04,820
Imagine being brother.
I don't have to imagine where I live

1432
01:01:04,821 --> 01:01:05,030
now.

1433
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:08,570
It was like Daniel Boone day I walk out,
it's like,

1434
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,730
Yup,
there's a,

1435
01:01:10,731 --> 01:01:14,270
they found this some,
there's some caves down.

1436
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:16,400
We,
we moved to the smokies or do they just

1437
01:01:16,401 --> 01:01:18,260
give land away down there?
Really?

1438
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:19,950
And uh,
yeah,

1439
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:24,260
a fucking
my own woods now for less than what a

1440
01:01:24,261 --> 01:01:27,320
townhouse in Nashville would cost.
But they,

1441
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,050
the people bought it from,
they found a cave on the back,

1442
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:35,290
back of the property down to can we kind
of backup does national forest and um,

1443
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:39,290
there's a bunch of like 3000 year old
Indian cave paintings and they're like

1444
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:41,930
native American k.
So there's university Chicago came down

1445
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:44,570
and studied it at all.
So now I'm going to spend the rest of my

1446
01:01:44,571 --> 01:01:47,210
life trying to figure out how to keep my
fucking kids from going in there and

1447
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,700
doing something,
you know.

1448
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:50,760
Right.
And Dick was here.

1449
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:51,260
Yeah.

1450
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:54,380
We're drawing a big cock and balls on
the Indians,

1451
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:57,290
you know,
but here's a thing that cocky eric would

1452
01:01:57,291 --> 01:02:00,020
be revered by people who found in years
from now.

1453
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,410
Right.
Why do we say it?

1454
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,290
Yeah.
I mean if you went to a cave,

1455
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:06,320
uh,
2000 years from now and they uncovered

1456
01:02:06,321 --> 01:02:09,870
some cave and it was a bunch of advanced
life comes off.

1457
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:11,240
Yeah,
people would be excited.

1458
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:11,811
They'd be like,
well,

1459
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,700
these things,
3000 years later,

1460
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,920
what happened?
Well,

1461
01:02:15,921 --> 01:02:17,810
if you look at like some of the ancient
artwork,

1462
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,770
right?
Like how about some of the statues are

1463
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:20,010
dudes

1464
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,900
grabbing each other's dicks and
wrestling?

1465
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:23,670
Do you ever see?
Yeah,

1466
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,370
yeah.
They were wrestling and in the process

1467
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:28,620
of wrestling,
one dude's grabbing of the guy's junk,

1468
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,470
which they did do the crush your balls
and shit.

1469
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:35,670
That was a move back then.
And so all those be honest,

1470
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:38,850
like in a real fight to move.
That's the move.

1471
01:02:38,851 --> 01:02:41,550
It's a way to go.
It's definitely the crush a man's taters

1472
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:44,520
or take away his ability to breathe.
The fights pretty much over.

1473
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,730
There was actually a mma fight where
they took place back when there was no

1474
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:50,220
rules.
There's a guy named the Pedro and he was

1475
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:52,560
fighting.
A guy named big daddy goodrich and big

1476
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:56,400
daddy reached into his pants and grabbed
a hold of his cock and balls and crushed

1477
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:58,110
it in his hand.
See this guy,

1478
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:02,430
it's just grabbing Dick's man.
The guy in the bottom is grabbing deck.

1479
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:05,880
He's holding that guy's hog.
It's rude,

1480
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:09,740
but that's how they wrestled back then.
They didn't give a fuck the,

1481
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:12,240
the Dick was something you could also
hold on to.

1482
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:13,920
You can hold onto the foot.
Why not?

1483
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,860
Why can't you hold onto the Dick?
So they were yanking on decks and

1484
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:20,820
pulling people along or they really
turned it up back then to this day,

1485
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:22,740
had to,
how long were they live in?

1486
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:24,000
You know,
I mean you,

1487
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:26,130
if you were one of these bad
motherfucker wrestler Dude's,

1488
01:03:26,131 --> 01:03:27,960
how much time did you have to be that
guy?

1489
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,180
That Dick roll around in the dirt and
then we'll go eat some grapes.

1490
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,920
That guy's got a hard on TV and watch a
lion eat my friend later on today.

1491
01:03:34,921 --> 01:03:36,960
That's not the day.
Look at the apple and the end of that

1492
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:39,960
guy's Dick,
the size of his hog.

1493
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:41,850
If that was real,
he was hard.

1494
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:45,030
This is sex then.
Is this not fight for the death that

1495
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:47,100
guys getting off on that or if he
doesn't,

1496
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:51,060
if he's not getting hard and that's just
how big his dick is went soft.

1497
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:55,800
This is not at all where I thought we
would go either.

1498
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:58,380
On my way over here.
It has to be said last time that we

1499
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:00,320
talked about bigfoot.
Yeah,

1500
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,400
no new opinions on that.

1501
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:06,660
Oh,
I got a big foot story,

1502
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,680
uh,
freely.

1503
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:09,280
No,
I think I already told him I made it.

1504
01:04:09,281 --> 01:04:12,520
I think did our,
I was going out.

1505
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:16,270
I used to live out west a long time ago.
I'm a buddy of mine were driving up to

1506
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:20,290
this little town called Leavenworth
Washington to go check out just like

1507
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:24,880
this weird little aspen,
Swedish ski town and fucking northern

1508
01:04:24,881 --> 01:04:26,860
Washington where you go get your potato
soup.

1509
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:28,540
That's another story though.
And,

1510
01:04:28,541 --> 01:04:31,060
uh,
we stopped at one of these roadside

1511
01:04:31,061 --> 01:04:35,110
coffee stands,
which are every 300 feet in Washington

1512
01:04:35,111 --> 01:04:37,780
state,
but this one was on like this sort of

1513
01:04:37,781 --> 01:04:42,781
timber road going up through the forest
and you pull over speaking to Harry and

1514
01:04:43,121 --> 01:04:43,841
Henderson's.
Wow.

1515
01:04:43,841 --> 01:04:45,340
It's all serendipitous.
But uh,

1516
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:48,130
we get out of the car and the wooden
statue from the,

1517
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:50,860
from the beginning of that movie is like
in the driveway.

1518
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:54,560
There was this old sasquatch statute and
I just,

1519
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,690
that's where I remembered it from.

1520
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:57,380
I was like,
that looks just like this thing from

1521
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:58,750
with day.
Yup.

1522
01:04:59,080 --> 01:04:59,980
And uh,
no,

1523
01:04:59,981 --> 01:05:02,620
that's not,
that's bad ass though.

1524
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:04,810
It's there.
A lot of bigfoot sightings out there.

1525
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:07,900
Well,
funny you should mention that.

1526
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,033
Uh,
we,

1527
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:12,880
we're stopping and we're getting coffee
or from this lady and I'm like,

1528
01:05:12,881 --> 01:05:13,480
you know,
whatever,

1529
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,310
trying to talk about the statute from
the movie.

1530
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,331
She's like,
yeah,

1531
01:05:16,331 --> 01:05:18,490
they stopped and here and then she pulls
out these,

1532
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:22,810
she had these old photo books,
like the family photo albums,

1533
01:05:22,811 --> 01:05:24,880
like huge photo albums.
Two or three of them,

1534
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:29,881
at least full of polaroids of sasquatch
that her family had taken in this house.

1535
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,540
Supposedly it's greatest idea to sell
coffee ever.

1536
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:39,580
Polaroids like photographs,
like fucking old of a real sounds.

1537
01:05:39,581 --> 01:05:40,840
Photos of Scat,
Sab.

1538
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,120
Well that's what she really wanted us to
think.

1539
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:46,390
Um,
there are just so many of them.

1540
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:49,990
I remember thinking like God,
she really went to some trouble here

1541
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:52,870
man.
Cause there's like giant photo albums of

1542
01:05:52,871 --> 01:05:55,170
sasquatch and they were all sasquatch
photos.

1543
01:05:55,171 --> 01:05:58,590
I'd taken off their back porch or out
the windows of the house and the for,

1544
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:01,540
cause they lived like right off the side
of the road and it was just fucking

1545
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:02,740
wilderness,
you know?

1546
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:05,700
And that's my satisfied story.
Was

1547
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,400
there any of them that made you go?
Not a damn one.

1548
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:11,520
Cause I was,
I I don't believe in big foot.

1549
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:13,890
So it definitely used to be a real
thing.

1550
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:17,610
I think that's what I think.
You think at one time it definitely

1551
01:06:17,611 --> 01:06:20,850
existed and they're all gone now.
There's an animal called the gigantic

1552
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:21,690
Pythagoras,
right?

1553
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:22,710
You know about that one.
Right.

1554
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,050
That was a real thing.
So that was basically a big foot.

1555
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:29,250
There's an eight foot tall,
gigantic bipedal ape.

1556
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,340
So they know that that was real.
So if that was real,

1557
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,330
it's entirely possible that one of them
made it across the bering land mass with

1558
01:06:36,331 --> 01:06:39,960
human beings should entirely possible
because they were from Asia and they

1559
01:06:39,961 --> 01:06:41,970
were from Asia.
A ride around.

1560
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,380
Yeah.
Yeti.

1561
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:45,180
Yeah,
a Yeti.

1562
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,710
Um,
neanderthal.

1563
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,420
I mean,
I'm a sasquatch.

1564
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,890
You could,
there's like a bunch of different names

1565
01:06:49,891 --> 01:06:51,990
for them,
but it was a real animal that lived,

1566
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:56,880
I think they found bones that were as
recent as a hundred thousand years.

1567
01:06:57,570 --> 01:07:02,570
So anatomically modern humans definitely
lived in the presence.

1568
01:07:02,671 --> 01:07:04,440
So what do you attribute all the
sightings too?

1569
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:07,080
In the last bull showers?
Her Blair's hurt.

1570
01:07:07,081 --> 01:07:08,590
Bears.
Bears hurt their paws.

1571
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,950
They walk the walk of Hind feet.
They do it all the time.

1572
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:12,660
Um,
I think most of it's bullshit.

1573
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:16,530
The reason I say this because there's no
real compelling evidence other than like

1574
01:07:16,531 --> 01:07:19,160
a couple of footprints that you think
someone could have for you actually had

1575
01:07:19,161 --> 01:07:19,591
it.
You didn't,

1576
01:07:19,591 --> 01:07:20,790
you'd be like,
you got to show for a while.

1577
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:22,330
You want her to talk to all these crazy
fight.

1578
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:23,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

1579
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,450
Were you ever at any time like this guy
might've saw something.

1580
01:07:27,451 --> 01:07:29,790
One lady had think saw something.
I don't think she was lying,

1581
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,850
but I think she probably saw wounded
bear and she saw it very briefly.

1582
01:07:32,851 --> 01:07:36,480
And the problem,
the real problem with people's memory,

1583
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,240
especially in some situation that freaks
you out,

1584
01:07:39,241 --> 01:07:40,770
like you think you might've saw a
sasquatch,

1585
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:44,340
your brain starts fucking with you and
it starts filling in the blanks with a

1586
01:07:44,341 --> 01:07:47,700
bunch of shit and then you start
repeating that shit as if it's that

1587
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:50,110
enable that something is wrong.

1588
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:51,890
But I would imagine if you're,
if you,

1589
01:07:51,891 --> 01:07:53,100
you've,
I'm sure you've been,

1590
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:54,420
you,
you lived in Seattle for a while,

1591
01:07:54,421 --> 01:07:55,440
right?
For a little while.

1592
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:57,510
So you know what it's like when you go
up into those mountains.

1593
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,310
It's like so thick.
It's beautiful.

1594
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:01,650
Unbelievable.
If that was going to go fuck off and get

1595
01:08:01,651 --> 01:08:03,420
lost somewhere,
that would be,

1596
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,880
dude,
that's lets us from that some real

1597
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,260
wilderness Mt.
Rainier,

1598
01:08:07,261 --> 01:08:08,094
right?
Yeah.

1599
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,120
God,
it's gorgeous.

1600
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,910
Um,
but their wilderness is so dense.

1601
01:08:11,911 --> 01:08:14,910
I was described it as like trying to
look through a box of q tips.

1602
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:15,830
It's a petri dish.

1603
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:17,460
They just,
it's in the,

1604
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:21,200
the ground is so soft and smushy from
all the pine needles.

1605
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,490
So my point is this lady saw something
in the distance,

1606
01:08:25,491 --> 01:08:27,200
she saw elk running,
right?

1607
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:31,400
And then she saw something standing up
and she looked at his face and she

1608
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:33,020
realized it was an ape.
She's like,

1609
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:34,970
oh my God,
I see an ape.

1610
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:37,210
How is there an ape?
And then she,

1611
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:39,380
she said to herself,
oh it's big foot,

1612
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:42,830
that's big foot.
And then it went over through this patch

1613
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:45,080
of timber cause everything's super,
super dense,

1614
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,221
you know,
10,

1615
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:48,170
20 yards further and you can't see it
anymore.

1616
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:51,500
She lost it completely.
But it makes sense that a bear was

1617
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:53,390
chasing elk.
That's what they do.

1618
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:56,060
They do it all the time.
They're probably chasing the elk.

1619
01:08:56,061 --> 01:08:58,350
There's probably a fon,
they'd probably try to get it into the

1620
01:08:58,351 --> 01:08:58,590
bear.

1621
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:00,510
Might've been heard this shit taste.
Yeah.

1622
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:03,320
And the bear might might've been hurt,
in which case,

1623
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:05,750
which happens all the time.
And when bears or her,

1624
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:08,090
they walk on two legs.
So if you're looking at this thing,

1625
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:11,060
bears can grow nine feet long,
right?

1626
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:13,670
That's real.
Black bears can be nine feet long.

1627
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:16,760
A really big black bear.
So if you're looking at this thing and

1628
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:18,020
the Pacific,
it's probably rare,

1629
01:09:18,021 --> 01:09:21,650
but there could be seven feet all day.
You can find a bunch of seven foot black

1630
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:22,431
bears.
Those are,

1631
01:09:22,431 --> 01:09:25,970
those are legitimate.
So this black bears walking around seven

1632
01:09:25,971 --> 01:09:28,700
feet tall,
standing up on its hind legs and you're

1633
01:09:28,701 --> 01:09:30,610
seeing it through the trees 30 yards
away.

1634
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,431
Like,
oh my God,

1635
01:09:31,431 --> 01:09:33,320
I see big foot.
So in her head,

1636
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:37,280
I don't think she was lying.
I think she definitely saw ash animal.

1637
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,270
She saw elk running and shop.
She saw a big ass animal in pursuit,

1638
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:45,440
but it easily could have been a bear and
she could have filled in the blanks in

1639
01:09:45,441 --> 01:09:48,660
her mind with all these false memories
that are attributing like,

1640
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:49,610
oh,
I saw his face,

1641
01:09:49,611 --> 01:09:52,550
it looked at me and annoys and all that
stuff.

1642
01:09:52,551 --> 01:09:55,580
Like people get wacky.
Like you think you saw something and you

1643
01:09:55,581 --> 01:09:56,414
didn't.

1644
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,330
It does no bodies.
That's the problem.

1645
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:01,730
There's nothing like no one's,
no one's found shit.

1646
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:05,060
No one's found anything and not a single
fucking bone.

1647
01:10:05,061 --> 01:10:06,760
I mean,
they found this gigantic [inaudible]

1648
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:10,340
bone in an apothecary shop and China,
and then they did a dig.

1649
01:10:10,341 --> 01:10:12,560
They went back to the spot.
These anthropologist said,

1650
01:10:12,561 --> 01:10:15,950
where the fuck did you get this?
They this giant primate tooth.

1651
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,870
There wasn't a gorilla,
it wasn't a human being.

1652
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:18,980
They're like,
where'd you get this?

1653
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:22,640
And they take them to the spot where
they got it and they find bones.

1654
01:10:22,641 --> 01:10:25,610
They find job bones that indicate that
it was by pedal.

1655
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,670
It's kind of controversial apparently,
but apparently by the way,

1656
01:10:28,671 --> 01:10:31,420
that jaws design,
they knew the distinct stood upright and

1657
01:10:31,421 --> 01:10:32,254
it's huge.

1658
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,510
I Dunno.
I met some dudes from stornoway,

1659
01:10:36,511 --> 01:10:39,480
Scotland wants,
which they look like they were from

1660
01:10:39,481 --> 01:10:41,370
another planet.
They were like the biggest fucking

1661
01:10:41,371 --> 01:10:43,920
people I've ever seen in my life.
There's four or five of these guys at

1662
01:10:43,921 --> 01:10:45,990
this little music festival and Kilkenny,
Ireland,

1663
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,240
and they'd all come down for the
festival.

1664
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,450
And these are men.
I'm not shitting man.

1665
01:10:51,451 --> 01:10:56,130
They were the biggest people I've ever
seen and they were all over and they

1666
01:10:56,131 --> 01:11:00,300
were just like fucking mountain mountain
blocked off the light when they walked

1667
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:02,370
through the door.
And then these like long gray hair and

1668
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:03,420
beards and shit,
and they're like,

1669
01:11:03,421 --> 01:11:05,910
you should this come up and play in
stornoway.

1670
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:09,840
Fuck it.
Only it takes eight fucking fairies to

1671
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:10,674
get there.
You know?

1672
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,400
It's just like,
I would actually love to go up.

1673
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:16,180
Oh,
I think of those dudes whenever I think

1674
01:11:16,181 --> 01:11:19,000
of those atlas stones.
Do you know what atlas stones are like

1675
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:24,090
the most manly way to workout ever.
You basically picking up these enormous

1676
01:11:24,821 --> 01:11:29,000
balls of stone and these dudes lift them
and they get them on their chest.

1677
01:11:29,001 --> 01:11:32,290
They hoist them onto these blocks.
They have contest to see who can,

1678
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,080
like when they do the straw man contest,
they picked those atlas stones up and

1679
01:11:35,081 --> 01:11:37,690
put 'em on progressively higher and
higher shelves.

1680
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,840
Giant,
giant people.

1681
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,250
Stone.
Yeah.

1682
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:42,820
Balls,

1683
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:44,800
giant stone balls.
Those people,

1684
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:47,140
I mean those are the ancestors of the
Vikings for sure.

1685
01:11:47,141 --> 01:11:48,340
Right?
For sure.

1686
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,800
That's where the vikings turned around,
I think.

1687
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:51,940
Yeah.
Yeah,

1688
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:53,430
I'm not mistaken.
They got there on their own,

1689
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:54,800
this

1690
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,390
they shot loads and to everybody it got
winter time and then they bailed old

1691
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,190
as fuck this place.
It's always raining.

1692
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:02,530
It's going out of here.
They took off too depressing.

1693
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:04,660
I got it.
I got some really good buddies now.

1694
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:06,730
Uh,
and Glasgow,

1695
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,440
all musicians you meet over the years
tour and a couple of guys particularly

1696
01:12:11,441 --> 01:12:12,274
that,
um,

1697
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:14,700
if I go over,
sometimes I'll do a little pickup band

1698
01:12:14,701 --> 01:12:16,690
with my,
with these guys and they're both like

1699
01:12:16,691 --> 01:12:20,320
hard glaswegians and my friend Lloyd
went to last summer I was over there.

1700
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:25,890
He took me up on a proper like car trip
up to the highlands and back down and

1701
01:12:26,351 --> 01:12:30,490
one day I think we got as far as like
Oban or,

1702
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:31,781
anyway.
But yeah,

1703
01:12:31,781 --> 01:12:33,340
there's,
there's parts of that stuff.

1704
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:34,810
It's,
it just,

1705
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:37,150
it looks like you're on another planet,
man.

1706
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:40,000
I can't even describe it.
I remember we got out of the car and a

1707
01:12:40,001 --> 01:12:43,510
couple of places and you try to wrap
your head around how ancient that shit

1708
01:12:43,511 --> 01:12:46,770
is and everything that took place there
and,

1709
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:47,950
and,
and how,

1710
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:50,680
you know how one were just standing
outside of the car on the side of the

1711
01:12:50,681 --> 01:12:50,860
road.

1712
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,930
And I'm like,
I'm fucking freezing to death.

1713
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:54,820
You know,
in the middle of August.

1714
01:12:54,821 --> 01:12:58,300
It's just a raining,
literally upside down and it's not even

1715
01:12:58,301 --> 01:12:59,560
raining.
You're just like this.

1716
01:12:59,561 --> 01:13:01,690
It's some harsh,
brutal shit.

1717
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,730
Always cold,
always cold,

1718
01:13:03,731 --> 01:13:05,320
always wet,
even when it's not,

1719
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:08,830
somehow I don't understand it.
It'd be like sunny and a mile and a half

1720
01:13:08,831 --> 01:13:12,370
later was like a blizzard and it was
just like fucking mental man.

1721
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:14,550
But it looked like another planet.
I was only,

1722
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,431
I've,
I felt like it could,

1723
01:13:15,431 --> 01:13:16,151
could've been a c,
uh,

1724
01:13:16,151 --> 01:13:18,670
setting out of star wars or something.
Yeah.

1725
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,160
If you think about it,
when you think about Scottish people,

1726
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:22,930
you always think of hardy,
right?

1727
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:23,681
Oh yeah.
Hardy.

1728
01:13:23,681 --> 01:13:26,740
Tough people instantly comes to mind.
Well,

1729
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,050
you know,
that another weird thing about it is you

1730
01:13:29,051 --> 01:13:32,590
always pure Americans especially like
were where you're from your ancestry and

1731
01:13:32,591 --> 01:13:34,150
this and that.
And I was,

1732
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,150
grew up in eastern Kentucky and then
moved to Central Kentucky.

1733
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:42,150
But like most of the,
the early settlers in the Appalachian

1734
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:45,640
region was really predominantly Scotch,
Irish and some German.

1735
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:50,800
So the first time I went to Scotland
to play music,

1736
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:53,060
I had jet lag.
And the first morning I woke up like

1737
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,160
really early,
you know,

1738
01:13:54,161 --> 01:13:54,791
and I was like,
fuck,

1739
01:13:54,791 --> 01:13:56,320
well,
might as well go walk around and check

1740
01:13:56,321 --> 01:14:00,160
things out and get out of the city and
everything's kind of coming to life and

1741
01:14:00,161 --> 01:14:02,680
people are going to work.
And I'm looking around at the faces,

1742
01:14:02,681 --> 01:14:03,600
man.
And it,

1743
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,260
he realizes like,
Yup,

1744
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:07,570
this,
I might as well be in Hazard Kentucky

1745
01:14:07,571 --> 01:14:10,570
right now.
It's the same stoic,

1746
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,880
very guarded,
you know,

1747
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,180
uh,
disposition.

1748
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:18,490
But then like once you get to know them,
and especially when you become friends,

1749
01:14:18,491 --> 01:14:20,200
they're just like,
they would do anything for you.

1750
01:14:20,201 --> 01:14:22,360
But it's very regal,
stoic,

1751
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:24,830
working class city.
There's something really special magic

1752
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,370
by Glasgow.
And I just kinda hit me like,

1753
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,010
this is definitely where my fucking
people came from.

1754
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:31,960
You know,
like that might as well be my uncle

1755
01:14:31,961 --> 01:14:35,080
bobby right there.
Uh Damn.

1756
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,610
The people that live there today,
man,

1757
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,600
like they get to go buy castles and
shit.

1758
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,790
There's castles near that.
You drive by every day.

1759
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:48,610
And how old those castles?
Like what's the oldest castle in

1760
01:14:48,611 --> 01:14:49,360
Scotland?
Uh,

1761
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,320
I'm not sure what the oldest one.
I mean there's like,

1762
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:55,690
it wasn't all 1000 years.
I think the one in Edinburgh is probably

1763
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,810
1200 years old.
Um,

1764
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:02,740
wow.
God been been penicillin matching

1765
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:04,330
anyway.
Yeah.

1766
01:15:04,331 --> 01:15:06,170
12 can look 14,
1600 years.

1767
01:15:06,171 --> 01:15:06,870
And we played,
uh,

1768
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:09,490
there was somewhere in Ireland,
this little town and across the street

1769
01:15:09,491 --> 01:15:14,260
from the hotel was this guard tower that
had been there for 1300 fucking years.

1770
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:16,260
And there's like viking boats they had
on display around,

1771
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,520
I'm just thinking,
yeah,

1772
01:15:18,521 --> 01:15:22,330
somebody a thousand years ago was up in
that window with a bow and Arrow,

1773
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:25,720
you know,
that's all they had.

1774
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:30,010
That's all they had shooting arrows down
at invading people.

1775
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:32,080
It gives you perspective though when
you,

1776
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:36,820
especially Europe in terms of old world
isn't that old when you think about

1777
01:15:36,821 --> 01:15:38,950
China or a lot of Southeast Asian
cultures,

1778
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:43,150
you know you're talking about 10,000 but
like Europe is a good example for me.

1779
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:46,000
Every time I go he gives me perspective
cause you think about everything

1780
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:48,010
happening in our country and everybody's
like,

1781
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,720
oh it's,
it's fucking going to hell.

1782
01:15:49,721 --> 01:15:52,940
And you know we're such a baby.
You know there's,

1783
01:15:52,941 --> 01:15:56,860
there's churches over there that are
five times older than the United States

1784
01:15:56,861 --> 01:16:01,590
and that it's still working somehow.
The oldest shit we can't have is like

1785
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,300
when I was living in Boston,
there was a cemetery that you can go to,

1786
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:09,220
we could see tombstones from like the 17
hundreds and you barely read it.

1787
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,110
You can pay,
they're all weathered and worn out.

1788
01:16:11,111 --> 01:16:15,940
Cause that shit with it in the 17
hundreds and you could just go over and

1789
01:16:15,941 --> 01:16:16,360
touch it.

1790
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,710
It's right there.
But people's,

1791
01:16:17,711 --> 01:16:22,510
how'd you too much because it's got a,
the numbers are all fucking worn off and

1792
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:23,620
shit.
Look at that one right there.

1793
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:28,390
Which just one that cathedral built in
1471,

1794
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,470
the oldest building in Glasgow,
I think 1471.

1795
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:36,190
The coolest Gig I ever played was in
London at,

1796
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:39,760
it's called St Pancras as his old church
building.

1797
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:41,890
Um,
which I think,

1798
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,100
you know,
monks at one time it was,

1799
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:49,060
they built it acoustically and designed
it out of stone for acquirers,

1800
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,300
like chamber bars and they didn't even
have a PA.

1801
01:16:52,301 --> 01:16:54,790
It was just me and an acoustic guitar.
I remember sitting there thinking like,

1802
01:16:55,780 --> 01:17:00,250
it was the most insanely beautiful
natural reverb I'd ever heard in my

1803
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:02,110
life.
And it's a really,

1804
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:03,011
uh,
it's an,

1805
01:17:03,011 --> 01:17:04,830
it's like right around King's cross,
you know,

1806
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:07,090
kind of a busy intersection,
but I think cause that it right there,

1807
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,610
st pancras.
No,

1808
01:17:10,611 --> 01:17:11,444
that's the,
uh,

1809
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:14,040
the train station.
They look older.

1810
01:17:14,041 --> 01:17:19,041
Good St Pancras old church.
It was really special though.

1811
01:17:20,231 --> 01:17:21,850
I remember walking for sound check and I
was like,

1812
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,590
I don't give a fuck if anybody comes to
mind.

1813
01:17:23,650 --> 01:17:25,570
I just get to sit here and play my
guitar in this room.

1814
01:17:25,571 --> 01:17:26,830
Yeah.
This is it right here.

1815
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:27,521
That's it.
Yeah.

1816
01:17:27,521 --> 01:17:29,790
It's like a little cute building.
Yes.

1817
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:32,800
And so in,
so the way they built the whole place,

1818
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:35,160
it reverberates while the rounded edges
and everything.

1819
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:38,430
Actually that's the side hall.
And then there was a,

1820
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:44,630
that's see the one third from the right.
The darker one?

1821
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,493
Yeah,
the door.

1822
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:47,320
Whoa.
Wow.

1823
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,460
That's beautiful man.
That was really special.

1824
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:50,810
So if somebody wants to look at this,
Jamie,

1825
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:53,240
what does the image,
if someone's listening to this saying

1826
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,760
pay Chris,
p a n c r a.

1827
01:17:55,761 --> 01:17:58,420
S.
Pancras p.

1828
01:17:58,421 --> 01:17:59,480
A.
N.

1829
01:17:59,480 --> 01:17:59,480
C.
R.

1830
01:17:59,480 --> 01:17:59,750
E.
S.

1831
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:03,380
How beautiful is that construction?
It's the oldest standing house of

1832
01:18:03,381 --> 01:18:05,180
worship.
I don't want to,

1833
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:07,730
I hope I'm not misquoting this,
but I think it's like the oldest church

1834
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,140
in the United Kingdom and it's in the
center of London.

1835
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:14,420
Wow.
So they designed it so that people could

1836
01:18:14,421 --> 01:18:17,820
play acoustic that was built to sing in
like just be like,

1837
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,360
oh yeah,
it does.

1838
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:22,740
The thing that the old keyboard affects
just have built in.

1839
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,800
Just pissed that like,
wow.

1840
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:26,030
The bloom on everything.

1841
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:27,800
When I was a kid,
uh,

1842
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,680
I lived down the street from this place
called Echo bridge.

1843
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,080
An Echo bridge.
Is this a,

1844
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:35,900
it's a near,
it's a newton upper falls and it's this

1845
01:18:35,901 --> 01:18:37,520
place where we'd all go hang out and
drink,

1846
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:41,660
but if you get underneath the bridge,
it gave you this crazy echo,

1847
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:46,940
just like ridiculous.
Dickless hello and uh,

1848
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:50,240
let's shut geeks like me walk around.
Constantly listening for,

1849
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,770
yeah.
Every kid in my high school thought he

1850
01:18:51,771 --> 01:18:53,210
was billy squier when you'd go down
there,

1851
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:58,250
you know,
when you find yourself alone,

1852
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:00,380
you'd be screaming it like a fucking
Dork.

1853
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,230
Remember we knew how to do the van Halen
thing on a notebook.

1854
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:07,730
The Vh logo.
First concert.

1855
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:08,691
Yeah,
man,

1856
01:19:08,691 --> 01:19:09,530
it freaked me out.

1857
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,090
Inhale.
And they were amazing.

1858
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,570
I had a buddy,
I used to work at this grocery store in

1859
01:19:15,571 --> 01:19:18,270
Nashville when I was,
how it kicking it around.

1860
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:19,680
And uh,
this guy was,

1861
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:21,030
he's really cool.
He's older,

1862
01:19:21,031 --> 01:19:24,540
he's in his fifties and he was local,
grew up in Nashville and I was like big

1863
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:26,190
music guy,
you know.

1864
01:19:26,191 --> 01:19:29,220
And uh,
so he saw like every show that ever came

1865
01:19:29,221 --> 01:19:31,470
through town and the seventies and
eighties.

1866
01:19:31,471 --> 01:19:32,850
What kind of grew up in that?
And he just,

1867
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,190
he'd always like,
tell me about the shows,

1868
01:19:35,191 --> 01:19:36,080
you know,
cause he's,

1869
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:41,090
he remembers,
he saw van Halen at the little call cm

1870
01:19:41,371 --> 01:19:44,790
and Nashville like down on the north
side of town back in,

1871
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:47,940
I think he said 77.
So it was before the first album had

1872
01:19:47,941 --> 01:19:50,970
come out and they were opening for black
sabbath and you know,

1873
01:19:50,971 --> 01:19:53,340
but this time,
deep purple and all these like riff rock

1874
01:19:53,341 --> 01:19:55,740
bands were just sort of the thing.
And he said,

1875
01:19:55,741 --> 01:19:59,760
these guys come out and he said it was
like a bomb exploded in that fucking

1876
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:00,280
place,
man,

1877
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,070
look at it.
He's like doing back flips off his aunt

1878
01:20:02,071 --> 01:20:03,230
and all that crazy shit.
No,

1879
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:04,710
we never heard that stuff,
you know.

1880
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:07,470
Wow.
And he said then Sabbath came and

1881
01:20:07,471 --> 01:20:07,980
everybody

1882
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,580
basically walked out after the third
song cause like they realized they had

1883
01:20:11,581 --> 01:20:14,610
just seen what was next

1884
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:20,223
man.

1885
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:26,110
I saw kiss when I was like 10,
10 or 11 years old.

1886
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:29,860
I saw him live.
Where you into them or is did you just

1887
01:20:29,861 --> 01:20:32,710
totally,
and I was really into him and my uncle

1888
01:20:32,711 --> 01:20:33,840
worked for their,
uh,

1889
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:36,330
advertising company that designed their
average,

1890
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,710
uh,
the album covers Howard marks

1891
01:20:38,711 --> 01:20:40,510
advertising company.
They're the ones that did well.

1892
01:20:40,511 --> 01:20:43,450
He's a genius.
Howard marks marketing,

1893
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:46,090
whoever's handling the marketing on
that.

1894
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,750
Well it was uh,
my uncle vinny and his friend Dennis

1895
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:52,000
where the artists,
they would make the album covers.

1896
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:53,440
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1897
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,200
So I get to meet h freely without his
makeup.

1898
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,770
I was like 11.
Ace freely is actually the first guy who

1899
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:03,050
ever did the harmonic tapping on tape.
Really?

1900
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:06,370
Eddie later got all the acclaim.
He took it and ran with it.

1901
01:21:06,371 --> 01:21:09,140
But I think the first time that was ever
recorded was on a kiss song.

1902
01:21:09,190 --> 01:21:13,570
Somebody using that technique.
He was fucking phenomenal man.

1903
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,080
Okay.

1904
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,730
When apparently they were really nice
guy too.

1905
01:21:16,731 --> 01:21:17,564
Right?
Ace,

1906
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:18,590
I don't know.
I'd never met him.

1907
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:20,750
Oh,
I know that he didn't get along with

1908
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:23,900
some of the other guys like Gene Simmons
and cause they're all hosting pricks.

1909
01:21:23,901 --> 01:21:25,550
I think the ace,
I think it's supposed to be like the

1910
01:21:25,551 --> 01:21:28,520
sweetheart,
the guy that's maybe,

1911
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:31,310
maybe uh,
Paul Stanley who's nice.

1912
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:34,310
He was a nice guy of Gene Simmons has
been nice to me.

1913
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,590
You know,
obviously everybody knows it's part of

1914
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:37,161
their thing.
Man.

1915
01:21:37,161 --> 01:21:38,240
I get it.
Yeah.

1916
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,930
I mean they were just,
they were rock star.

1917
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,510
They've been rock stars for so long.
We think about that.

1918
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:47,790
They were rock stars in the 70s they
were rock stars when,

1919
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:50,090
when it meant something.
Yeah,

1920
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:52,250
it's a difference.
I'm not sure what it,

1921
01:21:52,251 --> 01:21:56,770
if it even is necessary.
Do we really need like roll what order?

1922
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,010
That is a rock stars.

1923
01:21:58,150 --> 01:21:59,320
Yeah.
Here's the problem.

1924
01:21:59,321 --> 01:22:02,230
We know too much about them.
All the mystery is gone because they

1925
01:22:02,231 --> 01:22:05,560
know it used to be like Robert Plant
would come down and fucking magic

1926
01:22:05,561 --> 01:22:07,180
carpet.
We didn't know where he was coming from.

1927
01:22:07,570 --> 01:22:09,580
You know,
it would show it at the time.

1928
01:22:09,581 --> 01:22:13,120
Thought he was on one.
You know Robert Plant in his prime,

1929
01:22:13,121 --> 01:22:14,500
right.
Who the fuck ever sign anything like

1930
01:22:14,501 --> 01:22:16,660
that?
Before they were taking elvis off the Ed

1931
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:17,950
Sullivan show because he was shaking his
hips.

1932
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:23,080
Robert Plant has got a piece on him and
it's pressed up against his pants,

1933
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:26,320
his pants or his tied as a glove.
He's got no shirt.

1934
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:28,780
He's like a shirt is completely open,
right.

1935
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:32,590
Be completely bare chested,
long hair and a voice that you'd never

1936
01:22:32,591 --> 01:22:35,080
heard before.
He never heard someone sing like hold

1937
01:22:35,081 --> 01:22:38,440
out of love.
I mean it's just he's doing something

1938
01:22:38,441 --> 01:22:40,990
different.
He's got some new thing going on and you

1939
01:22:40,991 --> 01:22:44,560
don't know shit about him.
There's no fucking podcast that he does.

1940
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:47,560
He doesn't have a twitter page.
We said stupid shit about trump and

1941
01:22:47,561 --> 01:22:48,030
hillary.

1942
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:48,500
Yeah,
they they,

1943
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,810
they actually did.
They never did any interviews or any ray

1944
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:54,200
didn't release singles actually pull out
people.

1945
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,200
Did you hear all these classic songs on
the radio now,

1946
01:22:57,201 --> 01:22:59,570
but they'd never put single.
They refuse to do singles.

1947
01:22:59,571 --> 01:23:02,750
They didn't do press dude there.
If you wanted to see led Zeppelin,

1948
01:23:02,751 --> 01:23:04,100
you had to go to the show.
Yeah,

1949
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:05,980
look at his cock.
Look,

1950
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,080
look at it.
Look at his car.

1951
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:10,900
He wants you to do up against his pants.
Of course he does.

1952
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:12,490
I mean,
I don't know if he had a sock there,

1953
01:23:12,491 --> 01:23:15,340
but I want to believe,
I want to believe that he was just out

1954
01:23:15,341 --> 01:23:18,190
there slinging tick.
A dude was like 17 when that first

1955
01:23:18,191 --> 01:23:21,220
record came out.
Imagine he wasn't even the first choice.

1956
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:22,640
They went through a few people.
Jimmy page.

1957
01:23:22,641 --> 01:23:23,740
Do you,
when you put the band together?

1958
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:24,281
Uh,
one,

1959
01:23:24,281 --> 01:23:29,110
one of my favorite singers of all time,
I love Robert Plant would always felt

1960
01:23:29,111 --> 01:23:32,770
like if Steve Marriott,
I always wanted to hear what that would

1961
01:23:32,771 --> 01:23:34,720
sound like if he didn't do the guy from
humble pie.

1962
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:38,530
Fucking incredible voice and he's
supposed to be,

1963
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,990
I'm not,
I want to say maybe page one Indian,

1964
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,770
but he couldn't do it.
I know they'd talked to maybe Rod

1965
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:48,580
Stewart was it was it faces at the time
or earlier there were there,

1966
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,010
I know Robert Plant wasn't choice number
one.

1967
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:56,440
Do they had to talk Bonderman to taking
the Gig page and John Paul Jones had

1968
01:23:56,441 --> 01:23:59,800
known each other through session work in
the mid sixties and when the yardbirds

1969
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:04,300
broke up,
Jimmy somehow thought he had rights to

1970
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:07,210
the name and he wanted to put together
like a super band of all his,

1971
01:24:07,211 --> 01:24:12,211
the his favorite musicians he played
with and bottom was a recommended by the

1972
01:24:12,821 --> 01:24:15,640
Bass player John Paul Jones because they
had to go and like talk him into it

1973
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,350
because he's playing with bands at the
time.

1974
01:24:17,351 --> 01:24:19,100
They paid him a lot more money.
Wow.

1975
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,950
On Jimmy's,
like I had to explain what they were

1976
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:24,850
trying to accomplish and sell him on the
idea that was,

1977
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,660
that was sort of a,
like every,

1978
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:29,290
we're talking about vans that are put
together by labels.

1979
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:33,340
It wasn't,
Jimmy page was a genius and a in a very,

1980
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:35,650
you know,
visionary kind of guy.

1981
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:39,220
So he knew he needed to build this band
to take over the world and that's what

1982
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:40,690
he did.
Wow.

1983
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:45,460
Great producer too,
to fucking phenomenal guitarist.

1984
01:24:45,461 --> 01:24:48,640
Right.
Probably one of the most inventive

1985
01:24:48,641 --> 01:24:51,340
guitar players ever.
A lot of people say sometimes,

1986
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:53,050
especially later when he's on the
morphine.

1987
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:55,870
Some sometimes it can be a little
sloppy,

1988
01:24:55,871 --> 01:24:57,130
but I like that.
I like,

1989
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,950
I hate perfect.
I would nothing more boring than

1990
01:24:59,951 --> 01:25:01,100
perfect.
So is that,

1991
01:25:01,101 --> 01:25:03,850
is the sound of a guitar is similar to
like a voice?

1992
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:07,840
Like sometimes to doodle have a raspy
crazy fucked up voice and it just makes

1993
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:09,850
it right.
I mean,

1994
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:11,740
yeah.
Any real artists player with an

1995
01:25:11,741 --> 01:25:15,220
instrument.
It doesn't matter what the guitar is

1996
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:17,770
with amp or anything.
Like anybody that has their thing,

1997
01:25:17,771 --> 01:25:20,080
they can pick up anything.
And within like three notes,

1998
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:22,980
you just know it's that person,
you know.

1999
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:25,510
What do you think of that?
How do you say his name?

2000
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:29,750
Lee Ray Lamontagne.
Is that how you say it?

2001
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:31,630
Yeah,
he's a like a songwriter.

2002
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:33,740
Do you know that song?
Jolene?

2003
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,040
Yeah.
He's got a really cool voice,

2004
01:25:36,041 --> 01:25:39,490
ma'am.
My Buddy Dan did a record with him and

2005
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,580
I've never met him,
but now he's a really cool

2006
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:47,140
dude.
His voice since think he's Kinda like,

2007
01:25:47,141 --> 01:25:49,840
he was Sorta,
if I'm not mistaken,

2008
01:25:49,841 --> 01:25:51,520
I won't be like,
well it's more like came into it later

2009
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:53,680
like I did.
You had to jobs and shit before and then

2010
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,600
just started doing it and that makes
sense.

2011
01:25:55,601 --> 01:25:59,110
Found successful later on.
I think that makes sense with a lot of

2012
01:25:59,111 --> 01:25:59,740
people,
man.

2013
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:04,160
I just think people like Justin Bieber,
like he's Kinda way

2014
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,370
harder road.
So way harder row to try to figure out

2015
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:10,280
like all things considered.

2016
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,110
He's probably handling it.
Okay.

2017
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:18,350
He's handling it.
Would you think about he was,

2018
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:22,220
what,
fucking eight or 24 years?

2019
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:23,540
Only four.
Holy Shit.

2020
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:27,890
He just told us already having just
turned 24 and he's rolling around on a g

2021
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:29,660
seven that's his day to day,
you know,

2022
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:31,850
whatever the fuck he wants to do all the
time.

2023
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:35,360
You know,
you don't pay attention to things.

2024
01:26:35,361 --> 01:26:38,180
I'm not like I'm,
I'm not glued into pop culture,

2025
01:26:38,181 --> 01:26:43,181
but somehow like you just can't not know
what Justin Bieber's up to once a month

2026
01:26:43,911 --> 01:26:45,530
just walking around in the world
anymore.

2027
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:50,540
But I would say that kid for most people
to be handed that type of existence and

2028
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:56,060
all of that scrutiny and all the shit
that comes along with that does things

2029
01:26:56,061 --> 01:26:56,990
to people.
You know?

2030
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:59,360
It definitely does,
especially if your personalities not

2031
01:26:59,361 --> 01:27:00,830
even formed yet.
Yeah.

2032
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:05,880
I can't imagine like I'm so grateful I
got into this business at 35 yeah,

2033
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:09,980
and not 21 because I was talking to my
friend John this weekend about this and

2034
01:27:09,981 --> 01:27:12,290
I was saying that it's almost like if
you made an epoxy,

2035
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:12,830
right.

2036
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:14,000
You know,
if you have a proxy,

2037
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:17,420
you have to put a couple ingredients in.
Like there's one thing and you mix it

2038
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:20,990
with another thing and then it hardens.
But if you add some shit in that that's

2039
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:23,720
not supposed to be there and it's fully
developed,

2040
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,520
right.
You're not going to take that shit out.

2041
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:28,850
I'll give you added oil.
You just wrote some oil in the epoxy

2042
01:27:28,851 --> 01:27:29,110
like,
oh,

2043
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:32,150
and now you fucked that whole thing up.
That's kind of what you're doing to a

2044
01:27:32,151 --> 01:27:34,640
person.
When you raise a person famous,

2045
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:39,340
have you take some reality star from the
time they're five and then they're gonna

2046
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,320
sit calm and a movie and then you've
gone through your whole,

2047
01:27:42,321 --> 01:27:45,020
I don't know why I said Reality Star,
but you've gone through your whole life.

2048
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,630
If you're that person,
if you're Justin Bieber,

2049
01:27:47,631 --> 01:27:49,820
you've gone through your whole life
under the eye,

2050
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,350
under the eye,
and it's gotten bigger and bigger and

2051
01:27:51,351 --> 01:27:52,940
bigger and more and more people paying
attention.

2052
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:55,670
Like you never had a moment like you did
when you're working for the railroad

2053
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:56,504
tracks.
Right.

2054
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,430
Or like,
you know,

2055
01:27:58,431 --> 01:28:02,660
I did going on the road for years or do
some of the jobs that I had before I was

2056
01:28:02,661 --> 01:28:04,550
ever a comedian.
They don't have any of those.

2057
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,820
They don't have the wondering if you
could pay your bill feeling.

2058
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,890
They don't know that feeling.
They don't have the,

2059
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:11,930
let's see,
I still feel like that,

2060
01:28:12,730 --> 01:28:13,610
you know,
that's what's fucked up.

2061
01:28:13,611 --> 01:28:16,400
My wife just like,
I'm still like,

2062
01:28:16,401 --> 01:28:18,950
I just,
I'll never not feel like that,

2063
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:20,220
you know?
Yeah.

2064
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:25,590
From never really had money or anything
like that or any aspirations to own a

2065
01:28:26,421 --> 01:28:29,540
house or those kinds of things.
So it's just a,

2066
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:30,910
okay.

2067
01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:31,481
Um,
you know,

2068
01:28:31,481 --> 01:28:33,130
especially with kids now,
like I just don't,

2069
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:34,030
it's,
there's no

2070
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:41,490
flamboyance yeah.
But now he lives a different life for

2071
01:28:42,161 --> 01:28:43,270
people like Rihanna.
These,

2072
01:28:43,271 --> 01:28:46,240
they're like literally citizens of the
world in any day of the week.

2073
01:28:46,241 --> 01:28:49,690
They could be in some five star hotel
and God knows where,

2074
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:52,610
you know?
Yeah.

2075
01:28:52,611 --> 01:28:55,890
God knows where.
Wow,

2076
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:58,540
that's a crazy way to live.
Very bizarre.

2077
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:01,830
I'm just shitting sentence flying on.
I couldn't it man because

2078
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:05,100
there was no way I don't ever,
I don't ever want to wake up and have

2079
01:29:05,101 --> 01:29:10,101
that kind of career cause it takes so
many people around you who are on a

2080
01:29:10,471 --> 01:29:13,410
daily basis just to maintain and keep.
See it's something,

2081
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,260
a machine that Laura's rolling,
logistically speaking,

2082
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:21,261
that you become enslaved to the job.
You know what I mean?

2083
01:29:21,541 --> 01:29:25,380
Cause you have all these,
there's like,

2084
01:29:25,381 --> 01:29:27,930
there's always this name,
like when you have superstar acts,

2085
01:29:27,931 --> 01:29:31,890
you know you put this head right here
and then everything below that just to

2086
01:29:31,891 --> 01:29:33,860
make that thing go around.
You know,

2087
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:38,430
and it just turns into this,
it's like a corporation really like with

2088
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:42,000
20 semi trucks and all this shit,
you know,

2089
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:44,430
and you've got to go out and make that
happen because now all these people

2090
01:29:44,431 --> 01:29:48,840
depend on you for their livelihoods and
careers and that's going to affect the

2091
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:53,070
artistic decisions you make because you
have to stay relevant culturally

2092
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:53,904
speaking.

2093
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:56,160
And if you,
if you want to do something different

2094
01:29:56,161 --> 01:29:58,350
next time,
well now this massive fan base isn't

2095
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,030
really going to fucking deal with that
very well.

2096
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:03,150
You know,
I can beastie boys put out Paul's

2097
01:30:03,151 --> 01:30:04,770
Boutique.
Exactly.

2098
01:30:05,070 --> 01:30:06,660
People want and what the fuck they want,
what the fuck.

2099
01:30:06,661 --> 01:30:09,240
But now it's a,
it's one of the class most greatest

2100
01:30:09,241 --> 01:30:11,550
records ever made.
But people back then didn't know what

2101
01:30:11,551 --> 01:30:12,930
the handle,
they didn't know what to do with that.

2102
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,390
They didn't,
they didn't have the beastie boys

2103
01:30:15,391 --> 01:30:17,460
classified in the artist's box.
Right.

2104
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:20,700
They had him in the pop music box.
So this is silly.

2105
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,200
You got to fight for your right to
party.

2106
01:30:22,201 --> 01:30:23,790
We get it.
You guys are partiers.

2107
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,800
Cool.
And then all of a sudden,

2108
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:28,110
you know Paul's Boutique,
it's like,

2109
01:30:28,111 --> 01:30:29,220
Whoa,
what is this?

2110
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:34,530
Oh you like David Bowie went from ziggy
startups to doing a solo album and like

2111
01:30:34,531 --> 01:30:36,840
nine months with Luther Vandross and
yeah.

2112
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,310
Well those are huge,
classic,

2113
01:30:38,311 --> 01:30:40,470
amazing records now.
But like you realize those guys were

2114
01:30:40,471 --> 01:30:42,510
playing in theaters when all that shit
happened.

2115
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:43,920
Whoa.
And he's just like,

2116
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:46,830
I'm done with this.
I'm going to go do this now.

2117
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:50,790
You literally cannot see anymore because
I fucking killed it on stage.

2118
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,850
That's over,
you know?

2119
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:56,040
Do you think Rod Stewart gets enough
credit?

2120
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:01,230
I don't act on either.
I think especially man faces and even as

2121
01:31:01,231 --> 01:31:03,870
early solo records,
there's are some amazing albums.

2122
01:31:03,871 --> 01:31:06,660
His voice is incredible.
The Hammer.

2123
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,170
What too much pussy do you think I'm of
his brain

2124
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:13,950
when he hit that?
Everybody like,

2125
01:31:13,951 --> 01:31:15,570
check please.
He's like,

2126
01:31:15,571 --> 01:31:15,990
wait,
I'll,

2127
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:17,850
that's all I got to do.
Because remember,

2128
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,270
go back to Maggie Mae,
you know,

2129
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,300
wake up Maggie,
like that song was that was there was

2130
01:31:24,301 --> 01:31:25,710
something in that song,
right?

2131
01:31:25,711 --> 01:31:27,870
There was a guy trying to figure his
life out,

2132
01:31:27,871 --> 01:31:30,820
hanging out with some chick stewards of
bags.

2133
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,010
Oh Man.
Question.

2134
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,440
What does that song as they called
Maggie Mae?

2135
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:36,950
Yeah,
him and Elton John.

2136
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,490
All those guys.
Like that's,

2137
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,110
yeah,
he was a beast.

2138
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:42,870
A different level.
But they started wearing like leopard

2139
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:46,470
tight pants and shit cause he could,
I mean look at that shit.

2140
01:31:46,471 --> 01:31:48,960
It ain't like he's not working looking
at luck.

2141
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:52,830
He actually was,
I think he almost played professional

2142
01:31:52,831 --> 01:31:55,390
soccer for Celtic or somebody.
Wow.

2143
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,750
He's like a really great soccer player
when he was a kid,

2144
01:31:57,751 --> 01:32:00,490
but he was too small.
So he had this and he's another one

2145
01:32:00,491 --> 01:32:03,390
right.
That like basically like you never get

2146
01:32:03,391 --> 01:32:05,200
to see one of those again.
No,

2147
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:08,200
I don't think so.
You're never going to see a lot of

2148
01:32:08,201 --> 01:32:10,360
things again just cause it,
there's just no,

2149
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,630
nobody that's actually,
that might know.

2150
01:32:12,631 --> 01:32:15,370
That's not necessarily true.
You might see more things now because

2151
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:16,413
that's true too.

2152
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:17,950
That's true.
Getting ahead of myself.

2153
01:32:17,951 --> 01:32:18,461
Like I,
you know,

2154
01:32:18,461 --> 01:32:19,211
for all intents,
I,

2155
01:32:19,211 --> 01:32:20,740
I shouldn't be here.
Right.

2156
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:24,430
That it wasn't an industry creation.
Right.

2157
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:27,520
So now like anything really is possible.
Yeah,

2158
01:32:27,521 --> 01:32:29,800
that's a good point.
You just have to fight and sift through

2159
01:32:29,801 --> 01:32:34,750
so much shit.
Most of the mediocrity to get to

2160
01:32:34,751 --> 01:32:37,090
something that really hits you or that
you connect with.

2161
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:38,710
Well,
I think you're also saying this out of

2162
01:32:38,711 --> 01:32:41,290
your own personal experiences where you
realize you could,

2163
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:45,060
you could have not been you like easily.
You could have not turned out into being

2164
01:32:45,061 --> 01:32:45,581
you.
Oh,

2165
01:32:45,581 --> 01:32:48,670
if I were to sit down in a room with a
bunch of people who know what's best,

2166
01:32:48,671 --> 01:32:50,470
I wouldn't have been me.
Yeah.

2167
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:53,620
You and most people that are successful,
you know,

2168
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:54,580
we,
it was just how it is.

2169
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:59,560
My first record,
we did shop to a few labels in town,

2170
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:01,800
but you know,
I was a little bit ahead of,

2171
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:06,280
ahead of the whole neo trad curve that
sort of kicked off in the last few

2172
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,410
years.
I made this really traditional country

2173
01:33:08,411 --> 01:33:10,000
record.
And,

2174
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,730
uh,
but it was,

2175
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:13,660
it was like hard country.
It was very,

2176
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:16,600
uh,
like an album I always wanting to make

2177
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:20,140
and we shopped it to a few people and
they just didn't really know it wasn't

2178
01:33:20,141 --> 01:33:22,590
the right time so nothing came of it.
Uh,

2179
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:24,880
so we self released it.
So then when I did the second one,

2180
01:33:24,881 --> 01:33:28,000
the metal modern and now we've got this
whole record about like,

2181
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,760
you know,
mine

2182
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:34,890
the,
the journey of the soul or mind or

2183
01:33:34,891 --> 01:33:36,570
whatever,
talking about turtles and fucking

2184
01:33:36,571 --> 01:33:37,470
tripping and shit.
Right.

2185
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:40,860
I was like,
I knew nobody is going to get this.

2186
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:44,820
Like I can waste time trying to find
somebody to release or we can just put

2187
01:33:44,821 --> 01:33:48,060
the damn thing out.
And I'm so glad we did it that way just

2188
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:53,070
because I know what happened was a
result of people hearing it and sharing

2189
01:33:53,071 --> 01:33:55,830
that with their friends 100%.
That's how I found out about it.

2190
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:59,010
I found out about it for people online
and I got to tell you the cover of it

2191
01:33:59,011 --> 01:34:00,090
threw me off.
At first.

2192
01:34:00,570 --> 01:34:02,870
The cover of it was that was me being a
smart ass,

2193
01:34:02,871 --> 01:34:04,410
cause I was like,
there's all this like,

2194
01:34:05,370 --> 01:34:06,203
uh,

2195
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:09,560
you know,
you go to these festivals and stuff,

2196
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:11,390
I'm like a grown ass man.
You know what I mean?

2197
01:34:11,391 --> 01:34:15,620
We're fucking stupid jobs now.
I was in this all of a sudden this

2198
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:19,070
position and going out playing all these
festivals and looking at these kids and

2199
01:34:19,071 --> 01:34:20,600
stuff,
doing it and on this is great.

2200
01:34:20,601 --> 01:34:22,550
You make a lot of friends,
but there's it,

2201
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,400
there's a lot in any industry,
there's a lot of,

2202
01:34:25,401 --> 01:34:28,130
uh,
people like for the wrong reasons,

2203
01:34:28,131 --> 01:34:31,050
you know what I mean?
Like just chasing something that they

2204
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:34,340
want to see themselves in as opposed to
something they see within themselves.

2205
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:35,120
Right,
right.

2206
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,790
And so we started doing these festivals
and there's a lot of like what they call

2207
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:41,990
like the younger hipster kids and stuff
when they had these 10 type photos that

2208
01:34:41,991 --> 01:34:44,150
were really popular a few years ago.
And I was like,

2209
01:34:44,151 --> 01:34:46,040
well,
how can I out hipster the hipsters?

2210
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:51,470
So I'll do a painting of a 10 type photo
and surrounded by like the tackiest

2211
01:34:51,471 --> 01:34:54,530
outer space.
My buddy that I did the thing with,

2212
01:34:54,531 --> 01:34:57,500
we were actually trying to make the
worst album cover of the year and we

2213
01:34:57,501 --> 01:34:59,750
ended up,
we ended up making a top 10 list on

2214
01:34:59,751 --> 01:35:01,310
rolling stone.
We didn't get the cherry,

2215
01:35:01,311 --> 01:35:02,144
but,
uh,

2216
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:06,050
I was loose just making the tackiest
fucking thing we possibly can.

2217
01:35:06,051 --> 01:35:11,051
I like the cheesy fonts and um,
it's kinda crazy because the music was

2218
01:35:11,091 --> 01:35:13,370
to me was so heavy and personal and
real,

2219
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:14,721
so I was like,
God,

2220
01:35:14,721 --> 01:35:17,030
man,
I don't want to be the kind of wanting

2221
01:35:17,031 --> 01:35:20,210
to make fun of like the Dude levitating
in the fucking k before,

2222
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:22,160
before people turn you into that.
You know what I mean?

2223
01:35:22,161 --> 01:35:25,600
Cause like that's not at all.
A lot of the shit was just stuff I've

2224
01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:28,940
been reading about or you know,
you're in character.

2225
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,800
Yeah.
But it was psychedelic country music.

2226
01:35:30,801 --> 01:35:31,431
It was like,
well,

2227
01:35:31,431 --> 01:35:34,610
which is a lot.
I love a lot of sixties rock and some of

2228
01:35:34,611 --> 01:35:37,270
my favorite country records ever made
were made in the late sixties.

2229
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,690
Some of the,
uh,

2230
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:42,710
Gene Clark and some of the early vern
Gosdin brothers type stuff.

2231
01:35:42,711 --> 01:35:45,320
There was this level of Psychedelia and
the production that was made.

2232
01:35:45,321 --> 01:35:47,610
It was so beautiful.
I got to get a list of shit to listen.

2233
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:49,600
Well I'll throw you some shit man.
Um,

2234
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:54,870
but then talented guys and I was kind of
a task masker so it's such a,

2235
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,410
such a young band because they wanted to
play loud and you've got to pull things

2236
01:35:57,411 --> 01:36:00,050
back or like you can only have this
symbol,

2237
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,930
that kind of thing and get it down to
the structure of the songs.

2238
01:36:02,931 --> 01:36:07,010
And we spent like three months on the
road just carving those songs out and

2239
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:07,610
the arrangements.

2240
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:09,340
And I had it pretty much,
you know,

2241
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:11,930
Doug Pussy tight,
which is waterproof.

2242
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:12,793
And then we,
you know,

2243
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:16,550
we came off the road and went right into
the studio the next day for four days

2244
01:36:16,551 --> 01:36:18,350
and just banged it out.
Oh Wow.

2245
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:20,510
We're in the groove.
Yeah.

2246
01:36:20,511 --> 01:36:23,930
Basically just plug up like five mics,
don't move anything and just lay it all

2247
01:36:23,931 --> 01:36:25,910
down.
And then Dave and I are with the mixing

2248
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:29,420
and then he had some great ideas and
postproduction like getting the sounds

2249
01:36:29,421 --> 01:36:33,050
around but then you come back and we had
all these separated recordings.

2250
01:36:33,051 --> 01:36:36,290
So to me I've realized the real fun is
putting everything in sequence and

2251
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:41,291
making these cycle to maximize I guess
the emotiveness of the records in terms

2252
01:36:42,591 --> 01:36:45,620
of a rollercoaster of emotions if you
know instead of just one.

2253
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:48,710
So like every time we do it now it's
always different.

2254
01:36:49,690 --> 01:36:52,730
Like the record I did after that was
recorded,

2255
01:36:52,731 --> 01:36:55,160
that one a totally different way,
still going fast.

2256
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:59,180
But you know,
I are always wanted to make a big kind

2257
01:36:59,181 --> 01:37:01,400
of lush orchestra,
all soul record.

2258
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,410
And then what I've learned is that I
don't want to be in the music business

2259
01:37:06,411 --> 01:37:09,350
because I'm going just going to be in
the surgical business.

2260
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:13,160
Um,
because there's this like the mechanical

2261
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:16,670
timeline of it all.
By the time we go in and make that

2262
01:37:16,671 --> 01:37:20,360
record your,
so you've been processing and thinking

2263
01:37:20,361 --> 01:37:24,800
about it so much for,
for months and you get in and you have

2264
01:37:24,801 --> 01:37:27,710
that release and it's,
it's like I equate it to driving in a

2265
01:37:27,711 --> 01:37:31,070
really heavy downpour rain storm for
like an extended period of time.

2266
01:37:31,071 --> 01:37:34,160
Or it's just like there's a mental
exhaustion that comes for it,

2267
01:37:34,161 --> 01:37:37,220
but you have to just kind of like keep
going and,

2268
01:37:37,221 --> 01:37:40,610
but by the time it's finished and mixed,
you've heard this thing like a thousand

2269
01:37:40,611 --> 01:37:42,350
times,
you don't ever want to hear it again.

2270
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:45,070
But now you got to go out and play it on
the road every night,

2271
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:48,320
a year and a half.
So we were constantly trying to reinvent

2272
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:50,450
every night,
how to keep that fresh and exciting

2273
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:54,860
while while holding the pause button on
going over here and recording what

2274
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:56,310
creatively

2275
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:58,350
you may already be on to.
Wow.

2276
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:01,440
So I'm,
I realized this year I'm going to take

2277
01:38:01,441 --> 01:38:04,710
the reins and want to do like I'm going
to play 30 festivals because those

2278
01:38:04,711 --> 01:38:07,680
things are always so fun just to go out
and get all the energy in your face.

2279
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:11,660
And then we're going to do probably a
double album and another record and just

2280
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:15,120
recorded also that when I do turn around
and want to go do like a really big long

2281
01:38:15,121 --> 01:38:17,820
two year tour,
we have all this new material and the

2282
01:38:17,821 --> 01:38:20,190
old stuff to pull from.
I like how you,

2283
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:23,010
you're approaching it and so like you're
approaching like a plan.

2284
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:25,590
It is a plane.
You have to look at it like a plan.

2285
01:38:25,870 --> 01:38:28,170
Do you think everybody does that?
Oh,

2286
01:38:28,171 --> 01:38:30,870
there's all kinds of different plans.
I just know it works for me.

2287
01:38:30,871 --> 01:38:33,870
I've learned more importantly what works
for my family and my sanity.

2288
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:36,480
Um,
I don't need to go play 300 shows a

2289
01:38:36,481 --> 01:38:38,550
year.
I don't,

2290
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,200
you know,
I'd rather go play

2291
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:46,800
30 or 60 shows and know that every one
of those was 110% as opposed to,

2292
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:49,410
you know,
you got the Tuesday and Wednesday shows

2293
01:38:49,411 --> 01:38:52,140
to get you to this weekend market where
everybody's counting their checks

2294
01:38:52,141 --> 01:38:55,830
already and shit and you're exhausted
and in the show suffer and these people

2295
01:38:55,831 --> 01:38:58,220
pay money or maybe they don't realize
that.

2296
01:38:58,221 --> 01:39:00,870
Like you can't hear anything for 40
minutes cause you don't ever want her

2297
01:39:00,871 --> 01:39:03,810
project negativity from the stage if you
can help it.

2298
01:39:03,811 --> 01:39:06,690
But there's going to be bad nights.
I just went every night to be great and

2299
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:10,290
then,
but most importantly right now for me,

2300
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:12,660
the fun is,
is this the studio and the,

2301
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:17,940
the process of trying to push it,
you get to what's next.

2302
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,040
You,
you totally different albums.

2303
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:22,400
Every time you put an album out it's
like completely [inaudible].

2304
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:24,990
I'm a music listener in lover first and
foremost.

2305
01:39:24,991 --> 01:39:27,300
Probably musicologists more than a
musician at this.

2306
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:28,380
Is that a word?
Yeah.

2307
01:39:28,381 --> 01:39:30,990
I mean I guess that's my field of study,
I guess.

2308
01:39:30,991 --> 01:39:31,710
Ecologist.
Yeah.

2309
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:36,150
If I had to like say that I have
obsessed over one subject enough to

2310
01:39:36,151 --> 01:39:38,760
where somebody should probably give me a
fucking piece of paper that says I know

2311
01:39:38,761 --> 01:39:40,170
what I'm talking about is probably
music.

2312
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:43,530
Um,
did you,

2313
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:46,500
when did it start?
Did you have this your whole life early,

2314
01:39:46,501 --> 01:39:48,000
early after a whole life?
Wow.

2315
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:50,880
Probably honestly first time,
um,

2316
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:53,850
from Michael Jackson.
Maybe I was like,

2317
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:55,560
you know what's Kinda fucked up about
this?

2318
01:39:55,650 --> 01:40:00,650
But you wouldn't have been you if you
didn't come into this so late.

2319
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:02,000
No.
Hell,

2320
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,420
your hope,
but then your hard life,

2321
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:04,231
right?
Your whole life.

2322
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:05,550
You'd loved music.

2323
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:08,450
You could have easily just been on a
path from the time you were in high

2324
01:40:08,451 --> 01:40:09,870
school.
We'll always played.

2325
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,600
Right.
But I'm glad I never like right.

2326
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,760
Recorded anything right until,
yeah,

2327
01:40:14,761 --> 01:40:15,720
cause when you're younger,
you know,

2328
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:18,040
Eric Clapton,
I love her clapping.

2329
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:19,800
Huge influence.
Never met the guy.

2330
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:21,820
But uh,
there's a great documentary that came

2331
01:40:21,821 --> 01:40:23,190
up,
but you can look back in his career.

2332
01:40:23,191 --> 01:40:26,730
He was so young and passionate and
talented.

2333
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,070
Uh,
there's one particular record he did

2334
01:40:29,071 --> 01:40:31,530
with a guy named John Mail.
It was like kind of the birth of like

2335
01:40:31,531 --> 01:40:34,530
rock and roll guitar tone is the first
time everybody plugged a Les Paul and a

2336
01:40:34,531 --> 01:40:38,400
Marshall and just crank the fucking
thing and that record that sound,

2337
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:41,580
everybody's like whoa.
Like that was the thing that happened.

2338
01:40:41,581 --> 01:40:45,330
But you can look at his career and he
was such a chameleon going through all

2339
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:49,500
these phases and a lot of it was
emulation or re-interpretation because

2340
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:49,860
he,
you know,

2341
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:53,710
got into substance abuse,
but you can see how much his career

2342
01:40:53,711 --> 01:40:57,340
shaped him more so than,
and all the people he'd been around and

2343
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:00,940
was friends with an exposed to and him
rubbing off on them and vice a versa.

2344
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:01,950
Wow.
But you'll,

2345
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:04,360
you,
anybody in their twenties is still,

2346
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:08,140
anybody I know in their twenties is
definitely still figuring out who they

2347
01:41:08,141 --> 01:41:09,970
are as a person.
Much less than artist.

2348
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:13,660
I'm almost 40 and I'm still figuring out
who I am as an artist,

2349
01:41:13,661 --> 01:41:15,430
you know,
cause every year,

2350
01:41:15,431 --> 01:41:17,140
you know,
you're going to feel different every

2351
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:18,520
fucking day,
much less two years from now and it's

2352
01:41:18,521 --> 01:41:19,920
time to make a record.
Yeah.

2353
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:21,790
And you're going to change it up as you
see fit.

2354
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:25,570
You're going to go with what?
What's going on in your mind right now.

2355
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,100
Right.
That's a beautiful thing.

2356
01:41:27,101 --> 01:41:27,934
Right?
You don't have a,

2357
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:32,530
I mean even though you have like a whole
sort of entity behind you in terms of

2358
01:41:32,531 --> 01:41:35,560
like people carrying your stuff and all
the jazz,

2359
01:41:35,561 --> 01:41:37,420
it's going on.
All the equipment that's involved in

2360
01:41:37,421 --> 01:41:39,400
doing one of your shows are very few
people.

2361
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:40,323
How many people you got?

2362
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:41,890
Uh,
myself,

2363
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:45,010
three members of the band.
We have a tour manager,

2364
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,570
we have a,
our side monitor sound guy,

2365
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:55,350
the front sound guy and my merch girl.
See he got blind penile keep us with,

2366
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:01,460
with the driver's side and I'll always
be in one bus and we got one truck to

2367
01:42:01,571 --> 01:42:06,220
haul the gear and all that shit.
That's pretty minimal compared to some

2368
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:08,290
bands in,
in respect.

2369
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:10,720
Like what you do kind of shows you do
that to that.

2370
01:42:10,721 --> 01:42:12,610
That is pretty minimal.
It's a,

2371
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:14,590
I would like,
I would keep it there as long as

2372
01:42:14,591 --> 01:42:18,130
possible no matter what happens.
Just because,

2373
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,650
you know,
I've never been like a big lights guy or

2374
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:22,650
any of that stuff.
It just putting away,

2375
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:24,640
those guys in my band are all pretty
amazing players.

2376
01:42:24,641 --> 01:42:28,700
We try to go out and put a show on if
you were doing something else though,

2377
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:32,140
like say if you are a part of a band,
that band was being promoted very

2378
01:42:32,141 --> 01:42:35,590
heavily by some record company that had
put the band together,

2379
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,633
you know,
some,

2380
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:39,280
you know,
they do like those manufactured bands or

2381
01:42:39,281 --> 01:42:40,114
something like that.

2382
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:44,200
You'd be in a situation where you're
basically required to do commercially

2383
01:42:44,201 --> 01:42:48,370
successful and viable music.
You couldn't just free ball like you're

2384
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:51,190
doing and doing whatever you want to do.
Um,

2385
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:53,530
I honestly like,
I don't know,

2386
01:42:53,531 --> 01:42:56,680
man.
All I know is that what's happened to me

2387
01:42:57,730 --> 01:43:00,100
and most of the people,
most of my friends are people that are

2388
01:43:00,101 --> 01:43:03,340
just kind of do their thing,
but there's definitely is that element.

2389
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:04,743
But there's,
you know,

2390
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:07,840
um,
I've only,

2391
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:10,120
I never thought I'd ever sign with a
record label.

2392
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:11,560
Really.
Um,

2393
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:13,990
yeah,
never had any interest in it whatsoever.

2394
01:43:14,050 --> 01:43:16,480
And the,
and then we,

2395
01:43:16,481 --> 01:43:18,310
you know,
all of sudden things kind of took off.

2396
01:43:18,311 --> 01:43:21,700
We met all of them came knocking.
Um,

2397
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:23,610
but like it was working fine by
ourselves,

2398
01:43:23,611 --> 01:43:27,270
just sort of subcontractor my team.
And the one thing I,

2399
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:32,460
the only reason any artist should ever
signed with a record label is for larger

2400
01:43:33,341 --> 01:43:35,230
recording budgets,
you know,

2401
01:43:35,231 --> 01:43:39,280
a larger toolbox right with and wish to
use to make your product,

2402
01:43:39,281 --> 01:43:40,114
let's call,
you know,

2403
01:43:40,690 --> 01:43:42,160
for lack of a better term.
Um,

2404
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:45,580
so they have like serious places where
you can go to,

2405
01:43:45,581 --> 01:43:49,450
you can get to ridiculous studios and
they know we're not,

2406
01:43:49,451 --> 01:43:51,530
I mean I still,
I still recording that,

2407
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:52,300
you know,

2408
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:54,650
my favorite city of Nashville is nothing
fancy about it.

2409
01:43:54,651 --> 01:43:59,651
It's just money for players and,
and gear you might not have or a and

2410
01:44:01,431 --> 01:44:05,030
then mixing and then the more time to
spend in the studio,

2411
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:06,321
it really is.
I don't,

2412
01:44:06,321 --> 01:44:06,851
you know,
we,

2413
01:44:06,851 --> 01:44:09,110
we did,
we did matter modern and three or four

2414
01:44:09,111 --> 01:44:11,660
days because we had to,
it wasn't necessarily,

2415
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:13,430
you know,
dark side of the moon was made like nine

2416
01:44:13,431 --> 01:44:14,340
months.
Yes.

2417
01:44:14,370 --> 01:44:15,500
That's a funny way.
I don't know.

2418
01:44:15,501 --> 01:44:17,300
But yeah,
it was definitely like two separate

2419
01:44:17,301 --> 01:44:18,780
extended sessions.
Wow.

2420
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:22,010
You know,
you don't just for me it's the,

2421
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:25,670
that's the fun is sitting in that room
and figuring out how to break shit and

2422
01:44:25,671 --> 01:44:28,190
make sounds I haven't heard before.
And you need time to do that.

2423
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:29,870
You need,
um,

2424
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:32,030
you know,
money.

2425
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:34,420
Uh,
but you can,

2426
01:44:34,530 --> 01:44:37,430
you can make great records for very
little money to,

2427
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,250
so what's the benefit of having a record
company?

2428
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:42,320
They pay for the gear.
Well,

2429
01:44:42,321 --> 01:44:44,950
they pay for,
the benefit of having a record company

2430
01:44:44,951 --> 01:44:46,190
is simply,
um,

2431
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,720
somebody else pockets or you,
it all comes back on you.

2432
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:52,490
And you know,
we don't want to pull the curtain back

2433
01:44:52,491 --> 01:44:53,660
too much here,
but you're basically,

2434
01:44:53,661 --> 01:44:56,090
I looked at it as like,
uh,

2435
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:59,630
going into business with a bank for at
least two records,

2436
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:02,270
uh,
take out a loan that I'm pretty sure

2437
01:45:02,271 --> 01:45:06,230
I'll never pay back because I'm the
recoup,

2438
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:06,801
you know,
it's in there.

2439
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:11,801
But I feel like I'm more of like a,
it all comes down to the bean counters

2440
01:45:12,621 --> 01:45:13,191
eventually.
Like,

2441
01:45:13,191 --> 01:45:17,210
I know my records sell to 300,000 copies
and at some point they'll have to decide

2442
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:21,440
whether that's fiscally viable to them
anymore because they don't,

2443
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:24,080
they don't make any money off me unless
I sell records.

2444
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:25,940
You know what I mean?
Like they don't,

2445
01:45:26,090 --> 01:45:28,820
it was a very friendly,
structured deal like touring and all

2446
01:45:28,821 --> 01:45:28,970
that.

2447
01:45:28,970 --> 01:45:31,460
Publishing shits completely separate.
It has nothing to do.

2448
01:45:31,461 --> 01:45:35,990
I just make records and they have to
sell them and I get to make the records

2449
01:45:35,991 --> 01:45:38,390
that I maybe couldn't or would make on
my own,

2450
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:40,310
I don't know.
But outside of that,

2451
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:41,970
a record company or perform,
um,

2452
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:47,590
provides marketing or reach or push or
even sadly in the music business,

2453
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:51,170
there's probably less bullshit and
politics.

2454
01:45:51,171 --> 01:45:53,180
There may even be less politics and
politics.

2455
01:45:53,210 --> 01:45:54,770
Uh,
you know,

2456
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:58,460
I probably would not have been up for
album of the year at the grammy's last

2457
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:01,670
year had I been on 30 tigers as opposed
to Atlantic records.

2458
01:46:01,671 --> 01:46:03,510
You know what I mean?
Um,

2459
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:05,480
no,
I think it was a great record.

2460
01:46:05,481 --> 01:46:08,720
I know I deserve to be there,
but it wouldn't have happened if you

2461
01:46:08,721 --> 01:46:11,660
didn't have that kind of weight at the
table.

2462
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:15,740
It's very honest and that can make you
feel like jaded against it all.

2463
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:16,850
Or you can be like,
okay,

2464
01:46:16,851 --> 01:46:20,620
well you know Wiz Khalifa,
they probably spend more money on

2465
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:24,410
marketing one single for Wiz Khalifa
than the mind higher project costs.

2466
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:29,540
So because they make all those records
and Bruno Mars or whoever sells 18

2467
01:46:29,541 --> 01:46:33,980
gazillion records,
guys like me get to make records and

2468
01:46:33,981 --> 01:46:37,280
that's how it works.
It's a trickle down

2469
01:46:39,190 --> 01:46:41,750
and it's all based on the money that
they made from a long time ago.

2470
01:46:41,751 --> 01:46:43,680
Really?
And then maintaining some sort of,

2471
01:46:43,690 --> 01:46:44,960
they're still making money,
man.

2472
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:46,460
The streaming thing,
you know,

2473
01:46:46,461 --> 01:46:49,070
they're all in bed now with the
streaming services we've talked about.

2474
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:50,130
Province

2475
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,470
steadily climbed back down,
but not really for me.

2476
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:55,770
Really truly artists crazy.
I have nothing against spotify.

2477
01:46:55,771 --> 01:46:57,360
I know people are like,
fuck that shit,

2478
01:46:57,361 --> 01:47:00,210
but look at it like this man.
The people that are streaming music,

2479
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:03,690
they're not buying records anyway,
but they're still finding your music.

2480
01:47:03,691 --> 01:47:04,920
There's still telling their friends
about it.

2481
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:08,310
They're still coming to your show,
which is how we get paid playing shows.

2482
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:13,050
They're still your family so you have to
either embrace it or go fucking do

2483
01:47:13,051 --> 01:47:14,870
something else.
Yeah,

2484
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:16,260
that's good point.
But now when,

2485
01:47:16,261 --> 01:47:18,840
when spotify starts kicking songwriters
12 points,

2486
01:47:18,841 --> 01:47:21,690
then yeah,
I'll do commercials for them until then,

2487
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:23,760
you know,
but they are doing,

2488
01:47:23,761 --> 01:47:27,230
whether you realize it or not,
you see it does count up but it counts

2489
01:47:27,231 --> 01:47:28,860
up.
But it is a weird thing when it's very

2490
01:47:28,861 --> 01:47:31,410
weird.
All is based on you selling art and you

2491
01:47:31,411 --> 01:47:33,180
don't pay for it specifically.

2492
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:35,640
Even even with that,
I feel more like Atlantic went into

2493
01:47:35,641 --> 01:47:38,640
business with me.
I fill in many ways still feel like a

2494
01:47:38,641 --> 01:47:40,620
very independent minded artists.
Like no,

2495
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:42,690
I don't go to meetings.
Nobody's telling me what to do.

2496
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:47,400
I don't have a manager or even
technically a publicist at this point.

2497
01:47:47,401 --> 01:47:51,420
I'm just sort of floating and making
writing songs and making records and

2498
01:47:51,421 --> 01:47:53,970
then we'd go play shows and that's if
you could just keep that.

2499
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:55,320
Yeah.
That's just,

2500
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:59,310
yeah.
I've in the last figure five years,

2501
01:47:59,311 --> 01:48:04,311
figured out where I want to be and what
parts of it mean and something to me and

2502
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:08,970
I know I'm getting and giving back with
the fans.

2503
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,590
Well,
I think it's also when,

2504
01:48:10,591 --> 01:48:13,890
if you can stick into that groove,
you stay in that groove right there.

2505
01:48:13,891 --> 01:48:16,590
You can maintain who you are,
you can,

2506
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:18,780
you could still explore new ideas.

2507
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:20,130
You can you,
you're not,

2508
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:22,020
you're not being pushed too much.
You know,

2509
01:48:22,021 --> 01:48:23,970
if you were,
if you were like being pushed to

2510
01:48:23,971 --> 01:48:27,030
constantly produce new stuff and it
could,

2511
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:29,510
I could imagine that wears on artists.
Well,

2512
01:48:29,511 --> 01:48:32,160
I just spent so much of my early life
working for other people.

2513
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:35,400
I just made a 0.1 day where I'm before I
moved to Nashville.

2514
01:48:35,401 --> 01:48:38,100
I'm not going to do that ever again.
I don't want to work for anybody else

2515
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:42,330
unless it's something somebody I really
admire or as like a really exciting

2516
01:48:42,331 --> 01:48:46,020
creative thing that like I feel like I
could benefit from or learn from being

2517
01:48:46,021 --> 01:48:48,780
involved with.
I understand that thousand percent but

2518
01:48:48,781 --> 01:48:50,580
what's interesting is when I talk about
on the podcast,

2519
01:48:50,581 --> 01:48:54,210
sometimes people who don't do that,
they do work for someone to have a job.

2520
01:48:54,211 --> 01:48:55,740
They get upset,
they feel like,

2521
01:48:55,741 --> 01:48:58,410
it sounds like you're talking down on
jobs,

2522
01:48:58,770 --> 01:49:01,530
but the reality is you're working there
for money.

2523
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:03,700
We've all done it.
Everybody's worked for my boys worth

2524
01:49:03,730 --> 01:49:04,830
more.
Some of my jobs,

2525
01:49:04,831 --> 01:49:07,470
I loved the railroad game.
If this all gave up tomorrow,

2526
01:49:07,471 --> 01:49:08,790
I actually,
it could be just fine.

2527
01:49:08,791 --> 01:49:11,220
I go back to the railroad and be totally
happy to go out and throw switches 12

2528
01:49:11,221 --> 01:49:13,770
hours a day,
having my four days off and make a good

2529
01:49:13,771 --> 01:49:15,630
salary,
you know,

2530
01:49:15,631 --> 01:49:17,190
whistle while I work,
all that Shit,

2531
01:49:17,191 --> 01:49:18,024
man.
Yeah,

2532
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:21,780
but a plant,
it doesn't hurt to have a plan B,

2533
01:49:21,781 --> 01:49:25,110
but no working for other people.
It was never something I enjoyed,

2534
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:29,190
but I think anybody that even hears a
say that the reality is if someone gave

2535
01:49:29,191 --> 01:49:31,350
them the option,
you don't have to work ever again.

2536
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:32,830
They'd go,
okay,

2537
01:49:32,830 --> 01:49:34,800
what would you do though?
He'd do whatever you want.

2538
01:49:35,310 --> 01:49:36,390
What I would do,
I would,

2539
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:38,370
I would fill my day up with learning
shit.

2540
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,020
You're one of the busiest fucking
people.

2541
01:49:40,021 --> 01:49:41,490
I know though.
You don't have a job,

2542
01:49:41,491 --> 01:49:42,630
but you,
you,

2543
01:49:42,850 --> 01:49:45,660
you were very proactive.
Human being.

2544
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:47,123
You know,
you do,

2545
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,280
you want all day long,

2546
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:50,360
but it doesn't mean you're not working.
You're not benefit.

2547
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:53,380
I do whatever I want,
but I earn it like I do shit.

2548
01:49:53,650 --> 01:49:55,210
I earn it.
I feel like I have to,

2549
01:49:55,211 --> 01:49:57,820
I have to work.
The thing with my job does,

2550
01:49:57,821 --> 01:49:59,980
it doesn't feel like work.
Right.

2551
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:04,870
There are parts that did feel like work
that I identified that really have

2552
01:50:04,871 --> 01:50:08,100
nothing to do with what I want to wake
up and do this now.

2553
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:11,620
I just don't do those things and now
it's like,

2554
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:13,343
you know,

2555
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:18,460
the travel sometimes feels like work.
The things that I do or don't feel like

2556
01:50:18,461 --> 01:50:20,410
working like this does definitely never
feels like work.

2557
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:22,990
Podcasts don't feel like work.
Stand up doesn't feel like work.

2558
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:24,910
Working for the UFC doesn't feel like
work.

2559
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:28,390
Those things don't feel like work,
but the stuff in between those things to

2560
01:50:28,391 --> 01:50:30,310
make sure those things work well.
That's the work.

2561
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:32,750
Sure.
Like do,

2562
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:36,430
do you handle the day to day admin or
100% yeah.

2563
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,290
I don't have anybody.
I don't have an assistant.

2564
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:39,580
My,
my take is always,

2565
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,980
if you need an assistant,
just do less shit.

2566
01:50:43,410 --> 01:50:47,920
You don't want someone that you have to
constantly check in on and make sure

2567
01:50:47,921 --> 01:50:50,130
that they've got their shit together and
I've had some friends that had

2568
01:50:50,131 --> 01:50:53,340
assistants and then your life becomes
their life and your problems come their

2569
01:50:53,341 --> 01:50:56,070
problems,
their problems become your problems as

2570
01:50:56,071 --> 01:50:57,990
well.
Anybody you invite into your life,

2571
01:50:57,991 --> 01:50:59,720
you're inviting their problems into your
lives.

2572
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:02,430
That's ultimately what I've learned and
it's also,

2573
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:05,550
I don't necessarily think in my case
it's necessary.

2574
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:08,130
Maybe other people are more busy and
they need assistance and nine,

2575
01:51:08,190 --> 01:51:11,280
I have a lot of friends who have
assistants a lot,

2576
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:13,950
you know,
but I just thought,

2577
01:51:13,951 --> 01:51:16,530
I don't function that way.
I I want to,

2578
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:17,970
when I wake up,
I set my,

2579
01:51:17,971 --> 01:51:19,560
I have a bunch of Shit I'm going to do
today.

2580
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:21,960
I set my alarm clock and I have a
schedule.

2581
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:23,160
What?
That schedule's mine.

2582
01:51:23,190 --> 01:51:24,230
I made yours.
Yeah.

2583
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:26,100
When I went running to the change it
whenever you,

2584
01:51:26,101 --> 01:51:27,120
whatever the fuck I want.

2585
01:51:27,470 --> 01:51:29,900
Yeah.
But her manager is like the sweetest,

2586
01:51:29,901 --> 01:51:32,720
most empathetic human being I've ever
met.

2587
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:33,620
And you know,
he's not just,

2588
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:37,070
he's not just responsible for me.
Well he's like the babysitter and the

2589
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:41,120
mother of the whole family.
But like sometimes if we've been on the

2590
01:51:41,121 --> 01:51:45,320
bus for awhile or are rolling Mo more
than anything to give everybody else a

2591
01:51:45,321 --> 01:51:48,620
break and do him a favor.
I'll go off on my own and like stay at a

2592
01:51:48,621 --> 01:51:51,380
different hotel or I'll go to a
different city for two days.

2593
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:52,810
And he's always like,
you know,

2594
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:55,040
he's from New Zealand and he's like so
sweet and he's like,

2595
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:56,860
fucking gigantic and uh,

2596
01:51:57,690 --> 01:51:59,460
you not me book your room.
No,

2597
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:00,550
I got it man.
It's like,

2598
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:02,000
are you sure?
And he's almost like,

2599
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:05,120
I almost feel like I'm hurting his
feelings because I won't let him take

2600
01:52:05,121 --> 01:52:05,990
care of my day.
It's like,

2601
01:52:05,991 --> 01:52:07,290
motherfucker,
I got priceline.

2602
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:11,210
You know what?
I can do this if people don't expect you

2603
01:52:11,211 --> 01:52:13,400
to be doing that though is interesting.
Right.

2604
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,980
The one they want to be able to handle
it so you don't have to do the mundane

2605
01:52:16,010 --> 01:52:19,400
things that a normal person.
So you got eight other people to take

2606
01:52:19,401 --> 01:52:20,930
care of.
Right now I'm grown ass,

2607
01:52:20,931 --> 01:52:21,711
man.
Yeah.

2608
01:52:21,711 --> 01:52:24,710
I would never want to do what you were
saying.

2609
01:52:24,711 --> 01:52:29,360
John Lennon did just lay around,
walk around naked and I can't do it.

2610
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:31,490
I don't think he liked to work.
Yeah.

2611
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,080
I mean,
he was a true artist.

2612
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,180
Yeah.
I get it.

2613
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:36,650
I mean,
I get it,

2614
01:52:37,730 --> 01:52:39,530
but I,
for me,

2615
01:52:39,531 --> 01:52:43,550
it's almost like I know what makes me
feel like shit and I know it makes me

2616
01:52:43,551 --> 01:52:44,070
feel good.

2617
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:45,260
Right.
It makes me good.

2618
01:52:45,261 --> 01:52:47,870
It's when I get shit done.
What makes me feel like shit is when I'm

2619
01:52:47,871 --> 01:52:50,270
lazy.
Then I get anxiety depressed,

2620
01:52:50,271 --> 01:52:52,460
feel weird.
I don't feel good.

2621
01:52:52,730 --> 01:52:54,650
I don't feel like I'm getting anything
done and people think that,

2622
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:57,680
oh,
because I work hard and I'm constantly

2623
01:52:57,681 --> 01:53:00,200
doing something that I never feel like
that now I definitely will feel like

2624
01:53:00,201 --> 01:53:02,120
that.
I just saw something recently.

2625
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:07,630
They proved that task completion,
your brain releases a chemical that

2626
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:10,100
makes you fucking feel great.
Oh yeah man,

2627
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:12,170
I did this.
I did something on purpose.

2628
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,900
When you finish your album,
when you're done phasing.

2629
01:53:15,110 --> 01:53:17,000
Oh,
but it's also terrifying.

2630
01:53:17,130 --> 01:53:17,990
Of course I'm short.
You're like,

2631
01:53:17,991 --> 01:53:19,370
God,
I got to like release that.

2632
01:53:19,630 --> 01:53:21,200
Yeah,
people are going to hear that shit.

2633
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:23,810
But yeah,
it does feel like

2634
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:28,430
a release.
It was the best way to put it.

2635
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:31,280
Yeah.
I think everybody should experience

2636
01:53:31,281 --> 01:53:32,300
that.
Even in a small,

2637
01:53:32,301 --> 01:53:36,280
I think little kids get that when they
earn their fucking karate belt belts and

2638
01:53:36,281 --> 01:53:38,970
they see a little kid get a yellow belt
and they tie it on there beaming it's

2639
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:40,160
face.
Oh my God,

2640
01:53:40,161 --> 01:53:41,660
I can't believe it.
I did it.

2641
01:53:41,661 --> 01:53:44,180
I did it.
And give him my oldest to hire fire for

2642
01:53:44,181 --> 01:53:48,170
anything and it's like you see them
light up that affirmation.

2643
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,520
Yup.
Getting something done.

2644
01:53:49,521 --> 01:53:50,390
They did it.
It didn't,

2645
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:53,030
I mean think about what specialty when
you're talking about like little

2646
01:53:53,031 --> 01:53:55,970
children,
like my seven year old loves to draw.

2647
01:53:55,971 --> 01:54:00,290
She's really into art and like she takes
a piece of paper and this is not a big

2648
01:54:00,291 --> 01:54:03,290
deal to us as grown men.
She takes a piece of paper and that

2649
01:54:03,291 --> 01:54:06,410
paper is blank,
and in her little brain she decides it's

2650
01:54:06,411 --> 01:54:07,610
going to be on that paper.
She's like,

2651
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:11,510
I'm going to draw a dog and then boom,
it's a dog and I'm going to draw a dog

2652
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:12,344
that has a wing,

2653
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:16,100
also has a tail and has a tale that
grows out of his forehead and they just

2654
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:19,130
make wacky shit up and she thinks it's
fucking hilarious.

2655
01:54:19,131 --> 01:54:22,130
Like gluck.
He's got a tail on his head high,

2656
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:26,570
but in her little mind she's learning
that she can do whatever the fuck she

2657
01:54:26,571 --> 01:54:29,660
wants with that time then you shouldn't
do that.

2658
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:32,750
No one's saying anything and little kids
gravitate towards that man.

2659
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:36,980
When little kids start drawing,
they gravitate towards this expansion of

2660
01:54:36,981 --> 01:54:40,250
the creative aspects of your mind,
like whatever it is in your mind that

2661
01:54:40,251 --> 01:54:43,400
causes you to have these ideas,
whatever in your mind that causes you to

2662
01:54:43,401 --> 01:54:48,110
think of a story that you want to write
down or up a drawing that you want to

2663
01:54:48,111 --> 01:54:52,130
try to accomplish and try to put down
those little things to a kid or magical

2664
01:54:52,370 --> 01:54:54,290
because they didn't have any of that
before.

2665
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:56,360
I mean they,
they just learned how to talk.

2666
01:54:56,361 --> 01:54:58,790
She seven,
there's only been talking for five and a

2667
01:54:58,791 --> 01:55:00,140
half years,
you know,

2668
01:55:00,141 --> 01:55:03,230
all that other stuff before is jibberish
and all of a sudden she's sitting in

2669
01:55:03,231 --> 01:55:05,030
front of the pad.
No one tells her what to do.

2670
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:06,590
Little seven year old like,
hmm,

2671
01:55:07,070 --> 01:55:08,770
I think I'm going to paint today.
She gets,

2672
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:10,910
gets out the paint and it just puts a
little,

2673
01:55:10,911 --> 01:55:11,744
this,
a little of that.

2674
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:14,120
You're flexing those little muscles,
you know,

2675
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:18,020
just as if you were doing pushups,
your flex in those creative fields,

2676
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:21,080
you know,
and to encourage that with kids.

2677
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:24,530
That's what we all love.
We all love doing something and people

2678
01:55:24,531 --> 01:55:24,921
say,
well,

2679
01:55:24,921 --> 01:55:27,770
I'm not very creative.
I just like working with wood tea that

2680
01:55:27,771 --> 01:55:30,500
is fucking creative.
Like carpenters,

2681
01:55:30,501 --> 01:55:32,180
a guy named Craig,
you built a house,

2682
01:55:32,181 --> 01:55:34,280
motherfucker.
Do you understand you can't do that.

2683
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,540
I can't do that.
I'm in,

2684
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:39,470
I'm in all of that pleasing.
Grew up around construction.

2685
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:42,500
It's fucking hard to do.
You build a bad ass house.

2686
01:55:42,501 --> 01:55:44,670
That shit is to do.
Or people that are like highly

2687
01:55:44,671 --> 01:55:48,180
mechanical inclined can can just take a
car completely appointing and put it

2688
01:55:48,181 --> 01:55:50,310
back together in the garage.
I've always been really envious.

2689
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:51,690
Build cars.
That's art.

2690
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:54,960
That's art mechanics.
There's an art to even being a mechanic.

2691
01:55:54,961 --> 01:55:56,130
Just doing it all.
Perfect.

2692
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:58,110
Putting it together,
using your mind,

2693
01:55:58,111 --> 01:56:01,740
thinking out how did it maybe a good
bore out this and put that in and swap

2694
01:56:01,741 --> 01:56:03,870
this out.
And what's the issue with the vehicle?

2695
01:56:03,871 --> 01:56:06,390
And there's like a,
there's like there's a creative aspect

2696
01:56:06,391 --> 01:56:09,600
to anything that's really satisfying and
I think that,

2697
01:56:09,790 --> 01:56:11,670
you know,
we kinda pound that out of kids,

2698
01:56:11,671 --> 01:56:12,600
man.
Yeah.

2699
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:13,493
I think that's

2700
01:56:15,410 --> 01:56:17,650
very true.
We pounded out of true,

2701
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:18,261
we will.
The,

2702
01:56:18,261 --> 01:56:20,900
it has no,
it doesn't serve capitalism.

2703
01:56:20,990 --> 01:56:22,130
Yeah.
You know,

2704
01:56:22,131 --> 01:56:23,330
so,
uh,

2705
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:25,070
the,
uh,

2706
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:30,140
like I was saying earlier,
I had this just train job and the first

2707
01:56:30,141 --> 01:56:31,790
year I was there I was just like out on
the ground,

2708
01:56:32,410 --> 01:56:35,150
like throwing the switches and
disconnect and the trains and hooking

2709
01:56:35,151 --> 01:56:37,520
them back up and that kind of thing.
And then I got,

2710
01:56:37,550 --> 01:56:41,120
I got promoted to the,
what they call the yard master or like

2711
01:56:41,121 --> 01:56:44,090
whether you your a yard balls and you're
in the truck and you're sort of in

2712
01:56:44,091 --> 01:56:48,340
charge of the inbound and outbound
manifest and everything that comes in

2713
01:56:48,341 --> 01:56:50,690
and how,
what gets blocked apart and switched

2714
01:56:50,691 --> 01:56:53,200
over to this track and you're building
other trains and you've got to get them

2715
01:56:53,201 --> 01:56:55,330
out of Tom.
And like as soon as they put me in that

2716
01:56:55,340 --> 01:56:57,470
job,
it was like the greatest job I've ever

2717
01:56:57,471 --> 01:56:58,790
had because I was playing tetris.

2718
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:01,210
You know what I mean?
It was just like fucking Baron von,

2719
01:57:01,211 --> 01:57:05,100
which housing and my little fucking
truck with my 8,000 radios like Taryn

2720
01:57:05,101 --> 01:57:08,630
trains apart and just watching it all
like happened and get it out the gate on

2721
01:57:08,631 --> 01:57:10,280
time.
And get it became like a high,

2722
01:57:10,281 --> 01:57:12,380
you know,
cause it's high pressure.

2723
01:57:12,381 --> 01:57:15,710
Very dangerous.
There's only three guys out there and

2724
01:57:15,711 --> 01:57:17,720
making all this shit.
Have you got the guy driving the

2725
01:57:17,721 --> 01:57:21,410
engineer to do breaking apart and then
whoever's on the back like sort of

2726
01:57:21,411 --> 01:57:23,840
playing the chess board?
Ooh Yeah.

2727
01:57:24,550 --> 01:57:25,840
I was like,
this is fucking awesome.

2728
01:57:25,841 --> 01:57:28,790
I got a big old thermos.
All that shit.

2729
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:35,240
Some good jobs for sure.
But if somebody came up to you in the

2730
01:57:35,241 --> 01:57:37,910
middle of that good job and said you
don't have to do this ever again,

2731
01:57:37,970 --> 01:57:39,530
you do whatever the fuck you want,
you would leave.

2732
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:40,920
Okay.

2733
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:42,190
It's a good job.
What I did.

2734
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:43,320
Yeah,
it's a good job for a job.

2735
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:43,951
Well,
I fucked up.

2736
01:57:43,951 --> 01:57:47,280
Took a management position after that in
these offices.

2737
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:50,010
Totally out of my element getting
screamed at on the conference call with

2738
01:57:50,011 --> 01:57:52,710
some other asshole.
Didn't get the train out on time.

2739
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:55,530
Isn't that crazy?
Because you went from having this cool

2740
01:57:55,531 --> 01:57:58,320
high pressure job that makes you feel
good to making more money,

2741
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:00,470
but you'd only get that juice anymore.
Yeah.

2742
01:58:00,471 --> 01:58:00,991
I was like,
man,

2743
01:58:00,991 --> 01:58:03,300
this is way too stable.
I better be a songwriter?

2744
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:08,801
No,
I burn out.

2745
01:58:08,801 --> 01:58:10,780
I hit vapor lock cause it was just those
other,

2746
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,950
I'm going to go to fucking golf.
I can't imagine shit with other dudes

2747
01:58:14,951 --> 01:58:17,620
and khaki pants now.
Like it's port came pretend to be this

2748
01:58:17,621 --> 01:58:18,520
guy.
Like what am I thinking?

2749
01:58:18,580 --> 01:58:20,260
Those are the guys that I think of when
I,

2750
01:58:20,261 --> 01:58:22,140
that thoreau quote.
Uh,

2751
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:25,540
most men live lives of silent
desperation.

2752
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:27,580
Yep.
Those are the man I think of those men

2753
01:58:27,581 --> 01:58:31,540
that have fallen into some salary
position where they're not happy and

2754
01:58:31,541 --> 01:58:33,910
they want to get out and they don't know
how well they have.

2755
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:36,760
They have the,
the downfall of being highly efficient

2756
01:58:36,761 --> 01:58:39,760
individuals and other ceos recognize
that and be like,

2757
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:42,160
I can put you on and working 90

2758
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:44,620
hours a week and you're going to get it
done because you won't let yourself

2759
01:58:44,621 --> 01:58:47,410
fail,
but you'll probably fucking drink five

2760
01:58:47,411 --> 01:58:49,670
pots of coffee a day and listen
sturgeon.

2761
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:50,860
Yup.
If you keep going,

2762
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:52,660
you've got a good position in this
company.

2763
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:54,490
I'm telling you,
you've got a bright future.

2764
01:58:54,850 --> 01:58:58,090
He didn't make it happen.
401K 51,

2765
01:58:58,091 --> 01:59:00,400
nine.
[inaudible] I'm making those numbers up.

2766
01:59:01,450 --> 01:59:02,800
All that shit.
That's crazy.

2767
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:05,560
It's most people,
you know,

2768
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:10,540
people get tired of people hearing this
because they don't know what to do.

2769
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:13,900
And so I didn't know what to do forever.
I mean,

2770
01:59:13,901 --> 01:59:15,100
I would just work,
you know,

2771
01:59:15,130 --> 01:59:16,270
but then you do,
well,

2772
01:59:16,271 --> 01:59:19,270
you always played music but never
thought it was something you could even

2773
01:59:19,271 --> 01:59:22,240
do for a job.
You would have non well known where to

2774
01:59:22,241 --> 01:59:26,320
go or how to do that until uh,
Mary's my loss Martin mean Wednesday and

2775
01:59:26,321 --> 01:59:26,831
I was like,
man,

2776
01:59:26,831 --> 01:59:27,880
I'm really unhappy.

2777
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:29,470
And she's like,
it's because you're supposed to be

2778
01:59:29,471 --> 01:59:30,760
playing music,
dumb ass.

2779
01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:32,620
And uh,
so I was like,

2780
01:59:32,650 --> 01:59:33,970
oh,
that's probably true.

2781
01:59:34,030 --> 01:59:36,280
So,
but if you did it earlier,

2782
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:38,710
you wouldn't be you.
It's the craziest thing ever.

2783
01:59:38,711 --> 01:59:41,680
It's like you had to go through all that
bullshit to get the sound that you have

2784
01:59:41,681 --> 01:59:44,080
now to get to the soul behind it that
you have now.

2785
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:47,650
That's the sound of a man who suffered.
Oh yeah.

2786
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:50,980
It's a sound of a man who understands
that's the woes as me.

2787
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:53,020
That's real.
That's a real,

2788
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:54,940
there's a real emotions,
you know,

2789
01:59:54,970 --> 01:59:57,070
like that Jolene song that we're talking
about,

2790
01:59:57,180 --> 01:59:58,540
it's your all is lost though,
man.

2791
01:59:58,541 --> 02:00:00,970
If it had happened when I was younger,
it had been way more interesting to

2792
02:00:00,971 --> 02:00:03,370
watch.
I would have fucked it up so hard.

2793
02:00:03,380 --> 02:00:04,440
Right.
So good.

2794
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:10,840
No,
I mean that's props to Justin Bieber and

2795
02:00:10,841 --> 02:00:13,180
we were hitting me and I'm just keeping
it together.

2796
02:00:13,450 --> 02:00:14,500
It's hard to,
uh,

2797
02:00:16,030 --> 02:00:17,650
it's hard to complain.
Yeah,

2798
02:00:17,651 --> 02:00:18,760
it should be.
You've got a great,

2799
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:20,860
great,
great band and families healthy.

2800
02:00:21,150 --> 02:00:24,040
You're in the groove.
I'm in the room doing my thing as far as

2801
02:00:24,041 --> 02:00:26,800
I want to.
You're in what my friend Vinny shoreman

2802
02:00:26,801 --> 02:00:31,801
calls Hakalau it's when you,
he's a hypnotherapist.

2803
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:34,270
Trains does a lot of mind work with
fighters,

2804
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:39,450
like a mind coach and he's like,
there's this state that you get in where

2805
02:00:39,491 --> 02:00:42,820
everything just flows,
everything's flows.

2806
02:00:42,821 --> 02:00:46,450
And that's does what you've,
what you figured out how to do so

2807
02:00:46,451 --> 02:00:48,790
brilliantly in your life is after you've
been through a bunch of bullshit,

2808
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:53,860
he figured out to get to a place of
success and then you're able to just do

2809
02:00:53,861 --> 02:00:55,480
your thing.
That's,

2810
02:00:55,510 --> 02:00:56,500
that's your flow.

2811
02:00:56,530 --> 02:00:58,930
Like you found your thing.
That's uh,

2812
02:00:59,110 --> 02:01:01,720
yeah.
And I had to learn that even in the last

2813
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:02,070
few years,
you know,

2814
02:01:02,070 --> 02:01:05,240
cause it's so easy when I've always
said,

2815
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:07,450
you use a metaphor and you're on the
train.

2816
02:01:07,451 --> 02:01:12,100
It's hard to tell how fast it's going
and more importantly where it's going.

2817
02:01:12,101 --> 02:01:16,690
Because a lot of times you don't really
have any control or even say so in that

2818
02:01:16,691 --> 02:01:17,680
matter.
And in some regards,

2819
02:01:17,681 --> 02:01:20,440
you don't want to know how the sausage
gets made.

2820
02:01:20,441 --> 02:01:25,441
But then
I am at a point now where as,

2821
02:01:26,540 --> 02:01:28,990
as,
as far as I ever want to go because I,

2822
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:31,450
I'm,
I have all the freedom to do what I want

2823
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:35,530
and it might not sell as good or as,
as great as the last one did.

2824
02:01:35,531 --> 02:01:39,500
But like I'm having fun and it's going
to be okay.

2825
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:41,210
You know,
I don't think you're going to have any

2826
02:01:41,211 --> 02:01:41,960
problems.

2827
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:45,620
I think the real issues have always been
in the past about distribution in terms

2828
02:01:45,621 --> 02:01:48,530
of like radio play,
a album sales,

2829
02:01:48,531 --> 02:01:49,730
so we don't do,
and I like you.

2830
02:01:49,731 --> 02:01:50,690
Yeah.
And a guy like you,

2831
02:01:50,691 --> 02:01:53,150
you're so locked in,
you're in,

2832
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:54,800
you came along at the right time,
man,

2833
02:01:54,950 --> 02:01:56,750
you came a lot,
you'd locked in the Zeitgeists but you

2834
02:01:56,751 --> 02:02:01,180
came along at the right time of the
Internet where like you're like she'll

2835
02:02:01,610 --> 02:02:04,490
look and right time.
I mean definitely not all luck,

2836
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:09,790
but there was definitely like
Roto song about turtles that year cause

2837
02:02:10,821 --> 02:02:13,580
it would have been very different
outcome.

2838
02:02:13,670 --> 02:02:16,250
It would have been like that year that
they had the two meteor movies.

2839
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:17,900
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2840
02:02:17,901 --> 02:02:18,734
Right.
Exactly.

2841
02:02:18,930 --> 02:02:20,000
You can't have a fucking,
Canada.

2842
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:25,160
Canada
wrote a book this year with the same

2843
02:02:25,161 --> 02:02:28,310
title as long as me and he's getting all
kinds of shit on her and I was like,

2844
02:02:28,311 --> 02:02:31,220
I didn't fucking come up with it.
Like don't send this to me.

2845
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:32,740
Yeah,
he stole it.

2846
02:02:33,700 --> 02:02:35,690
Yeah.
Turtles all the way down.

2847
02:02:35,691 --> 02:02:37,700
People don't want to look into things.
I didn't know what it meant until he

2848
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:40,310
explained it.
I don't still don't know what it means.

2849
02:02:40,311 --> 02:02:41,144
I just thought,
you know,

2850
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:42,290
yeah,
it was cool.

2851
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:46,190
Now I know what it means,
but in a very dumbed down for the fit to

2852
02:02:46,191 --> 02:02:48,920
make this a standalone podcast explained
to people what turtles all the way?

2853
02:02:48,930 --> 02:02:50,720
Well,
it's a jocular expression,

2854
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:51,650
uh,
more of,

2855
02:02:51,651 --> 02:02:52,520
uh,
um,

2856
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:59,420
a funny way to put what is originally a
concept as far as I know that was first

2857
02:03:00,150 --> 02:03:03,610
described in detail by a swit priest's
name appeared on Chardanne.

2858
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:06,570
Uh,
all about how about the Omega point,

2859
02:03:06,571 --> 02:03:10,620
the universe and how all consciousness
amidst from this one central point of

2860
02:03:10,621 --> 02:03:13,020
origin,
where the whole thing banged out from,

2861
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:17,460
and it's all just expanding and
reciprocating back to itself and like

2862
02:03:17,461 --> 02:03:21,030
absorbing everything going on.
But it's this one point where all things

2863
02:03:21,031 --> 02:03:22,860
spiritual,
scientific,

2864
02:03:22,861 --> 02:03:25,260
metaphysical,
all matter in the universe,

2865
02:03:25,261 --> 02:03:29,370
all fucking knowledge emits from,
and he got blackballed from the Vatican

2866
02:03:29,371 --> 02:03:31,470
for preaching that Whoa.
Cause he was like,

2867
02:03:31,471 --> 02:03:35,400
you don't necessarily need to stand in a
building to talk to God because God is

2868
02:03:35,401 --> 02:03:38,190
everywhere and all around you and inside
you all the time,

2869
02:03:38,670 --> 02:03:42,570
whatever you want God to be or you know.
Um,

2870
02:03:42,630 --> 02:03:43,463
so the,
the,

2871
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:46,540
I got it from a Stephen Hawking book,
we're,

2872
02:03:46,850 --> 02:03:48,380
and it's weird,
you can go around the world and there's

2873
02:03:48,381 --> 02:03:51,390
all these ancient civilizations,
whether it be some native American

2874
02:03:51,391 --> 02:03:55,650
tribes or parts of Far Eastern Asia
where they find like these adherence to

2875
02:03:55,651 --> 02:03:58,710
turtles and elephants and older culture
and Hindu mythology.

2876
02:03:59,130 --> 02:04:02,820
There's even a Hindu illustration
representing sort of a similar figure or

2877
02:04:02,821 --> 02:04:07,821
myth that it all set on the back of this
great turtle like flying around in space

2878
02:04:07,831 --> 02:04:09,000
because they,
the hills,

2879
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:13,860
those animals in such regard as old and
wise creatures actually turtles are the

2880
02:04:13,861 --> 02:04:18,210
oldest living species on the planet.
They predate crocodiles.

2881
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:20,270
Wow.
And the,

2882
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:20,740
the,
the,

2883
02:04:20,740 --> 02:04:23,520
the symmetry of their shell designs,
no matter what species,

2884
02:04:23,521 --> 02:04:27,000
it's always 13 pieces,
which a lot of the old tribes thought

2885
02:04:27,001 --> 02:04:30,690
had something to do with the lunar
phases of the sun and how it was all

2886
02:04:30,691 --> 02:04:32,190
tied in together with,
you know,

2887
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:34,033
um,

2888
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:35,650
hello.
Anyway,

2889
02:04:35,651 --> 02:04:37,980
lost along the way of saying that song
was

2890
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,710
written as a result of a lot of fucking
reading.

2891
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:42,720
No,
not necessarily taking drugs,

2892
02:04:43,230 --> 02:04:45,810
you know,
it wasn't that the original,

2893
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:48,210
um,
one of the more original calendars.

2894
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:50,610
Who's narrow your 13 lunar cycle
calendar?

2895
02:04:51,710 --> 02:04:53,790
Is it mine?
Yeah,

2896
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:55,440
mine are.
I think that is what it is.

2897
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:59,480
I think it is a Mayan calendar,
but it's all these things I sort of

2898
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:03,270
found or symbiotically we're connected.
I was reading at the time and it just,

2899
02:05:03,271 --> 02:05:05,220
and I was about to have my first child
and was just like,

2900
02:05:05,221 --> 02:05:08,370
man,
I want to make a country record about

2901
02:05:08,371 --> 02:05:09,230
all this shit.
Or like,

2902
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:11,160
you know,
write a song about the book of the dead

2903
02:05:11,190 --> 02:05:13,740
and,
but as a traditional country record and

2904
02:05:13,741 --> 02:05:16,590
then incorporate some classic rock
Psychedelia.

2905
02:05:17,490 --> 02:05:22,320
So that was all that was,
that's how I found you.

2906
02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:23,700
People Online,
like,

2907
02:05:23,701 --> 02:05:25,830
Yo,
they do skype making psychedelic country

2908
02:05:25,831 --> 02:05:26,150
music.

2909
02:05:26,150 --> 02:05:28,350
You've got to have him on your pot.
Then everywhere you go,

2910
02:05:28,351 --> 02:05:30,660
people are making like handy,
like hand blown glass,

2911
02:05:30,661 --> 02:05:32,280
third eyes and shit.
You know what I mean?

2912
02:05:32,281 --> 02:05:33,900
Like you get,
you get some real interesting

2913
02:05:33,901 --> 02:05:34,734
characters,
man.

2914
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:36,730
Get a little too many of those.
Throw it out there like that.

2915
02:05:37,050 --> 02:05:38,790
Just too many bongs out there.
Right.

2916
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:42,720
People still rock the bond though.
It's gotta respect that.

2917
02:05:42,721 --> 02:05:44,580
You know,
it's like driving a manual car.

2918
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:47,070
I never was a bond guy.
It's too heavy,

2919
02:05:47,071 --> 02:05:48,210
man.
I got shit to do,

2920
02:05:48,211 --> 02:05:49,044
man.
I can't.

2921
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:52,410
Oh,
that just peeled down or the DAB thing.

2922
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:54,270
The,
I got friends in Colorado,

2923
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:57,000
California now.
The first time I ever did with shit.

2924
02:05:57,080 --> 02:05:59,940
Uh,
this is pretty embarrassing story,

2925
02:05:59,941 --> 02:06:02,250
but my,
my buddy,

2926
02:06:02,251 --> 02:06:03,540
you know,
they were all like California,

2927
02:06:03,541 --> 02:06:05,730
Colorado guys.
They roll pretty hard.

2928
02:06:05,731 --> 02:06:08,330
I'm not really a heavy smoker man,
to be honest on the road.

2929
02:06:08,420 --> 02:06:11,640
It keeps me occupied from time to time.
But if I'm writing maybe,

2930
02:06:11,641 --> 02:06:14,260
but at home,
you know,

2931
02:06:14,270 --> 02:06:15,640
there's no need.
So it,

2932
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:19,290
the first time I did that shit,
I didn't know what it was.

2933
02:06:19,950 --> 02:06:21,900
You know,
I just pulled it like it was a big old

2934
02:06:21,901 --> 02:06:23,460
bong rip and they're like,
everybody's face was like,

2935
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:24,870
oh,
you know,

2936
02:06:24,871 --> 02:06:27,540
it was like I need you instantly know
you just did something you shouldn't

2937
02:06:27,541 --> 02:06:28,430
have.
Oh No.

2938
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:29,610
And uh,
I was like,

2939
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:32,400
Oh fuck man.
So I sat down and looked at a couple of

2940
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:33,960
minutes.
I just started getting really cold and

2941
02:06:33,961 --> 02:06:35,040
clammy and I was like,
Yup,

2942
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:37,320
I'm going to Puke.
So I went over and was like,

2943
02:06:37,321 --> 02:06:40,650
I'm fucked this guy.
So I right in the sink and I was like,

2944
02:06:40,651 --> 02:06:41,580
dude,
I got to go home.

2945
02:06:41,581 --> 02:06:44,100
I feel like dog shit now.
And I'm pretty sure I'm dying.

2946
02:06:44,550 --> 02:06:47,820
So I had,
we lived in this apartment and I was

2947
02:06:47,821 --> 02:06:49,860
like,
went out the door and turned the corner

2948
02:06:49,861 --> 02:06:52,290
to go down the hallway to my,
and it was full on vertigo,

2949
02:06:52,291 --> 02:06:52,830
like the hall.

2950
02:06:52,830 --> 02:06:55,440
Every time I took a step,
the hallway got twice as long.

2951
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:57,420
That was like,
this is fucked up.

2952
02:06:57,440 --> 02:06:59,760
My wife was out of the country on work
at the time and I was like,

2953
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:04,320
I remember I was sitting down in the
hallway just like trying to get my shit

2954
02:07:04,321 --> 02:07:06,060
together man.
Cause was I thought I was having a

2955
02:07:06,061 --> 02:07:10,260
fucking heart attack.
It was just like pat like sweating and I

2956
02:07:10,261 --> 02:07:13,350
remember this voice saying,
get up you stupid junkie.

2957
02:07:13,351 --> 02:07:15,840
Fuck before somebody comes out here and
sees you,

2958
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:18,960
you know,
sitting in the hallway like a dumb ass.

2959
02:07:18,961 --> 02:07:22,530
And I managed to like pop out of it and
as soon as I get back to my place and

2960
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:24,750
sit down on the couch,
everything was fine.

2961
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:28,680
But it was just so initial and the rush.
I was just like,

2962
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:30,660
I don't,
nobody needs to be that stone

2963
02:07:32,250 --> 02:07:33,810
that fast.
I'm sorry.

2964
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:36,190
Yeah.
What kind

2965
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:41,020
of milligrams are you getting you think?
Or they just had like Neil head torch

2966
02:07:41,021 --> 02:07:43,150
thing,
which is $3,000 glass piece.

2967
02:07:43,151 --> 02:07:45,160
I was like,
you guys are taking this shit way too

2968
02:07:45,161 --> 02:07:48,130
seriously there.
You could be cured and fucking cancer

2969
02:07:48,131 --> 02:07:50,740
somewhere right now.
I'm pretty sure if they put the effort,

2970
02:07:50,741 --> 02:07:53,440
energy,
and mind power.

2971
02:07:53,441 --> 02:07:56,780
And have you seen the laser bongs now?
Some I got a video sent to me.

2972
02:07:56,781 --> 02:08:00,340
The daylight sky,
like a pressure activated laser bong.

2973
02:08:00,370 --> 02:08:03,940
He like shoots a beam and ignites the
flower of Jesus like that.

2974
02:08:03,941 --> 02:08:05,170
Why is,
what's the fuck's that guy?

2975
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:07,053
Come on,
man.

2976
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:10,690
The thing is they might be curing cancer
space colonies that somebody is going to

2977
02:08:10,691 --> 02:08:12,910
need to build.
You know how many cancer patients are

2978
02:08:12,911 --> 02:08:15,340
taking dabs?
That might be the key out here.

2979
02:08:15,341 --> 02:08:16,780
Probably a lot.
Get them on it.

2980
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:18,070
If I,
if I had,

2981
02:08:18,310 --> 02:08:21,580
if I was dying of terminal cancer,
that's when you want to be that high.

2982
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:22,443
But at this thing,

2983
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:24,250
do that again,
Jamie.

2984
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:26,770
Yeah.
Oh,

2985
02:08:26,771 --> 02:08:28,270
that's it.
Look at this thing.

2986
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:30,740
Of course he had a fucking hates the
light laser.

2987
02:08:31,180 --> 02:08:34,210
This is fucking insane.
Now how do you not go blind staring at

2988
02:08:34,211 --> 02:08:35,830
this?
So he's heating it up.

2989
02:08:36,370 --> 02:08:38,830
It's cooking.
It's a good question.

2990
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:42,310
And then he takes a big hit.
Wow.

2991
02:08:42,830 --> 02:08:43,663
Yeah.
Anyway,

2992
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:44,641
the,
the,

2993
02:08:44,641 --> 02:08:46,700
the medical strength stuff.
I totally understand.

2994
02:08:46,780 --> 02:08:49,790
And this seems like you go blind,
like you were standing at a welder.

2995
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:51,980
Yeah.
You know you have to wear a welding

2996
02:08:51,981 --> 02:08:55,220
mask.
My very,

2997
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:57,960
very close to my life in my life
recently that went,

2998
02:08:58,050 --> 02:08:59,450
went,
it was dealing with that,

2999
02:09:00,050 --> 02:09:00,980
uh,
vertigo,

3000
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:03,620
no,
like heavy medical issues,

3001
02:09:03,621 --> 02:09:07,580
health issues.
And we got him some edibles and he's

3002
02:09:07,581 --> 02:09:10,070
like,
it's the only thing that made it okay.

3003
02:09:10,190 --> 02:09:14,210
Like that discomfort.
And so when I had to have a sinus

3004
02:09:14,211 --> 02:09:17,480
surgery,
we talked about this when we played the

3005
02:09:17,481 --> 02:09:20,900
grammys out here last year,
I was sick as fuck man.

3006
02:09:20,901 --> 02:09:23,630
Like I was getting all year for like the
last year and a half on the road.

3007
02:09:23,631 --> 02:09:25,760
I was getting his horrible sinus
infections all the time.

3008
02:09:25,761 --> 02:09:27,980
And I will,
I just assumed it was allergies.

3009
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:33,110
Tennessee's really bad about that.
And we'd go to Texas or Atlanta places

3010
02:09:33,111 --> 02:09:35,840
in October when all these crazy dogwoods
are kicking off.

3011
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:38,540
And I would lose my voice.
And you know,

3012
02:09:38,541 --> 02:09:41,000
by no fault of my own,
it became very frustrating from a

3013
02:09:41,001 --> 02:09:43,670
touring standpoint.
Cause I felt like I was always sick.

3014
02:09:43,710 --> 02:09:45,890
And it was because I was,
so,

3015
02:09:45,891 --> 02:09:48,860
we flew out into the grammys.
I was all plugged up,

3016
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:51,650
couldn't sing,
obviously biggest gig in my life,

3017
02:09:51,651 --> 02:09:55,160
kind of stress in it.
So the label guys sent me to this doctor

3018
02:09:55,790 --> 02:09:59,180
who looked up in there and realizing I
probably had my nose broken at some

3019
02:09:59,181 --> 02:10:02,180
point or just a really deviated septum
when I was younger.

3020
02:10:02,181 --> 02:10:05,820
So I like a broken air filter.
But then when they did the scan,

3021
02:10:05,821 --> 02:10:08,750
they,
all of the cavities were just completely

3022
02:10:08,751 --> 02:10:11,480
caked with residual bacteria and
infection.

3023
02:10:11,481 --> 02:10:12,350
And he's like,
he's like,

3024
02:10:12,351 --> 02:10:15,020
if you get on a plane and fly home,
you probably going to get meningitis.

3025
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:17,300
So we had to play the grammys.

3026
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:19,340
He put you like nuked me with all this
shit.

3027
02:10:19,341 --> 02:10:21,980
I don't even know what he did,
but it opened it up for like a day.

3028
02:10:22,210 --> 02:10:24,830
It's where I was able to sing.
So the next day,

3029
02:10:24,831 --> 02:10:26,090
the whole band,
they flew home.

3030
02:10:26,091 --> 02:10:29,540
I just stay out here for like nine days,
I think can go in every morning,

3031
02:10:30,110 --> 02:10:32,900
twice a day for Ivs,
for him to clean that shit out so I

3032
02:10:32,901 --> 02:10:34,330
could home.
Wow.

3033
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:37,550
So then we came back and did the surgery
to correct it all,

3034
02:10:37,710 --> 02:10:40,400
like went in there and scraped and
cleaned them all out and shit.

3035
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:42,530
And uh,
along with the,

3036
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:46,010
the Septum they fixed the Septum.
So I haven't had a single issue since

3037
02:10:46,011 --> 02:10:47,960
all that happened.
I haven't been sick one time,

3038
02:10:47,961 --> 02:10:51,440
which is like changing my life.
But while I was recuperating,

3039
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:54,500
long story short,
I didn't want to take any of the opioid

3040
02:10:54,501 --> 02:10:57,980
or the fucking pills that they gave me
to deal with the pain.

3041
02:10:57,980 --> 02:10:59,120
I was like,
I'm not taking that shit.

3042
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:00,590
You know,
you're going to give me this for four

3043
02:11:00,591 --> 02:11:01,490
weeks.
Like no,

3044
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:04,760
no way.
And so I just got a bunch of medical

3045
02:11:04,761 --> 02:11:07,580
strength edibles and my wife and the
kids,

3046
02:11:07,581 --> 02:11:10,490
they had to come my way to run a house.
We had it bad to be here to like recover

3047
02:11:10,491 --> 02:11:15,050
and Shit and man just laying in bed,
listening to headphones stoned out of my

3048
02:11:15,051 --> 02:11:19,820
mind for like a week recovering.
And that's was kind of awesome because

3049
02:11:19,821 --> 02:11:24,821
you feel like when you're actually in
pain or when you need that type of heavy

3050
02:11:26,690 --> 02:11:28,160
type of alleviation,
what,

3051
02:11:28,190 --> 02:11:31,700
what it is actually doing an offering
you in terms of relief.

3052
02:11:31,701 --> 02:11:35,000
And it gave me a whole new understanding
and respect for like the medical side of

3053
02:11:35,001 --> 02:11:36,560
that shit.
Here we are back on pot again.

3054
02:11:36,561 --> 02:11:39,530
But um,
and then my buddy who dealt some pretty

3055
02:11:39,531 --> 02:11:43,070
serious cancer said it was literally the
only thing that made him feel better.

3056
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:44,740
So what did it do for you?
Like see your,

3057
02:11:44,770 --> 02:11:48,410
your terrible agony.
Yeah that was all fucks all plugged up.

3058
02:11:48,411 --> 02:11:52,190
I had like all this galls in your shit
and know I could feel where they'd been

3059
02:11:52,191 --> 02:11:54,410
in there like behind right.
Been scraping and I can just,

3060
02:11:54,411 --> 02:11:56,930
you know,
so it immediately like all that was gone

3061
02:11:57,440 --> 02:12:02,440
and you just sorta get really docile and
euphoric and rely on me so fucking high.

3062
02:12:02,841 --> 02:12:05,840
But like it didn't affect me in a,
in an overdose.

3063
02:12:05,841 --> 02:12:09,830
He nauseous sorta way like too many
edibles cause your body actually needs

3064
02:12:09,831 --> 02:12:10,664
it.
Needs it.

3065
02:12:10,730 --> 02:12:13,610
Yeah.
I laid there listening to headphones and

3066
02:12:13,611 --> 02:12:15,470
came up with the record.
I'm working on that.

3067
02:12:15,650 --> 02:12:18,740
That's great for me cause it was like I,
that's what I want to do next,

3068
02:12:18,741 --> 02:12:20,180
you know?
Um,

3069
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:21,313
yeah,
it's,

3070
02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:23,300
it's a crazy ride,
those edibles.

3071
02:12:23,301 --> 02:12:25,610
But if you can take that ride,
you get something out of it.

3072
02:12:26,030 --> 02:12:29,540
And sometimes people take the ride and
the feeling is just to,

3073
02:12:29,690 --> 02:12:33,110
to self examine a tuna the nor yet and
to sing.

3074
02:12:33,590 --> 02:12:37,340
Sometimes she just can't handle a on a
mass legality issue.

3075
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:39,500
I mean,
if anything,

3076
02:12:39,501 --> 02:12:41,580
I know it's just gonna fuck pot up,
you know?

3077
02:12:41,581 --> 02:12:44,090
But from a medical stance,
I do,

3078
02:12:44,210 --> 02:12:48,350
I can't see any reason why we're still
even talking about this.

3079
02:12:48,530 --> 02:12:49,520
Yeah.
You know?

3080
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:50,630
No,
it doesn't make sense.

3081
02:12:50,631 --> 02:12:54,470
We were were being fucked over by giant
pharmaceutical companies that are making

3082
02:12:54,471 --> 02:12:59,090
billions of dollars and they would
realize how much more money they would

3083
02:12:59,091 --> 02:13:03,170
be losing every year.
If marijuana becomes fully legal,

3084
02:13:03,230 --> 02:13:06,260
they've already lost money for sure.
I guarantee you there's people that are

3085
02:13:06,261 --> 02:13:09,890
buying edible marijuana right now that
would have bought pain pills.

3086
02:13:09,891 --> 02:13:11,610
They know it.
Also insurance companies,

3087
02:13:12,210 --> 02:13:13,710
you know,
on the job accidents.

3088
02:13:13,730 --> 02:13:14,990
Oh,
he had weed in his system.

3089
02:13:14,991 --> 02:13:17,630
We're not going to pay that.
So I got my life insurance now.

3090
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:19,550
I man,
this is crazy.

3091
02:13:19,551 --> 02:13:21,770
I did one of the first interviews I ever
did.

3092
02:13:21,771 --> 02:13:26,270
I think I talked about what like the
first time I moved to Nashville and how

3093
02:13:26,271 --> 02:13:30,800
like I didn't really know anybody and it
was like 2005 and it was a different

3094
02:13:30,801 --> 02:13:32,130
town then.
So like I basically

3095
02:13:32,210 --> 02:13:36,810
I said I spent most of my time listening
and playing blue grass and drinking,

3096
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:39,930
which is pretty much what everybody
does.

3097
02:13:40,110 --> 02:13:42,550
The first year they moved to Nashville,
but uh,

3098
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:44,760
then I said like,
after that,

3099
02:13:44,761 --> 02:13:48,150
while I moved out to Utah and got this
job and you've got sober was working on

3100
02:13:48,151 --> 02:13:51,210
with them.
So somebody put on my wikipedia page

3101
02:13:51,211 --> 02:13:55,440
that I've talked about my struggles with
alcohol and those people read that Shit,

3102
02:13:55,441 --> 02:13:56,790
man,
when I had to get a life insurance

3103
02:13:56,791 --> 02:13:57,860
policy,
like they showed up,

3104
02:13:57,870 --> 02:13:59,460
they'd read all the interviews and like,
wow,

3105
02:13:59,461 --> 02:14:01,110
you've been really open about this and
that.

3106
02:14:01,111 --> 02:14:02,370
And I was like,
yeah.

3107
02:14:02,371 --> 02:14:05,970
And they're like,
so you do the whole medical test.

3108
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:09,810
And of course that test positive for thc
because I'm on the road all the time.

3109
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:10,973
And I was like,
but I don't,

3110
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:12,780
I don't smoke it.
You know,

3111
02:14:12,860 --> 02:14:15,060
I vape or edibles.
I don't actually,

3112
02:14:15,061 --> 02:14:16,950
I'm not a smoker.
I've never smoked cigarettes.

3113
02:14:17,310 --> 02:14:21,900
But they list you as a smoker and now I
have like a criminally fucking insane

3114
02:14:21,901 --> 02:14:24,960
yearly life insurance policy because of
course like,

3115
02:14:24,961 --> 02:14:25,570
you know,
they think,

3116
02:14:25,570 --> 02:14:26,341
well,
if a musician too,

3117
02:14:26,341 --> 02:14:27,680
this guy's going to die.
We can't fuck.

3118
02:14:27,990 --> 02:14:29,160
Yeah.
The exact same thing.

3119
02:14:29,190 --> 02:14:30,001
Yeah.
It's insane.

3120
02:14:30,001 --> 02:14:30,451
Like,
I don't know,

3121
02:14:30,451 --> 02:14:33,690
I don't even smoke,
but I'm listed as a smoker and it's like

3122
02:14:33,691 --> 02:14:38,670
literally $9,000,
some crazy fucking premium just to make

3123
02:14:38,671 --> 02:14:40,830
sure my family's okay if I die on a
business trip.

3124
02:14:40,890 --> 02:14:41,641
Yeah.
They,

3125
02:14:41,641 --> 02:14:43,940
um,
they tested me and uh,

3126
02:14:43,950 --> 02:14:44,820
they said,
well,

3127
02:14:44,850 --> 02:14:46,320
you tested positive for pot.
I go,

3128
02:14:46,321 --> 02:14:47,460
yeah,
that's cause I smoked pot.

3129
02:14:47,970 --> 02:14:49,230
You're need to know that.
Like,

3130
02:14:49,231 --> 02:14:51,210
what are you doing?
Trying to pretend I'm not hardly ever

3131
02:14:51,211 --> 02:14:52,680
died from smoking pot.
No,

3132
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:54,180
it's stupid.
It's a dump thing.

3133
02:14:54,210 --> 02:14:56,670
Unless you think that I'm going to do
dumb shit cause I'm high all the time.

3134
02:14:56,700 --> 02:14:58,970
If that's what you think,
but that doesn't make any sense.

3135
02:14:58,990 --> 02:15:01,350
You need to test how healthy I am.
Guess what?

3136
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:02,520
I'm fucking healthy,
right?

3137
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:03,750
Yeah.
I work out all the time.

3138
02:15:03,810 --> 02:15:04,920
Super healthy,
eat good.

3139
02:15:05,190 --> 02:15:07,020
I know what I'm doing.
Like you don't know what you're doing.

3140
02:15:07,050 --> 02:15:08,370
The problem is you don't know what
you're doing.

3141
02:15:08,371 --> 02:15:09,560
You're the insurance guy,
right?

3142
02:15:09,561 --> 02:15:11,640
You don't know what you're doing.
If you knew what you were doing,

3143
02:15:11,641 --> 02:15:14,040
you would look at each individual and go
at this guy's fine,

3144
02:15:14,580 --> 02:15:15,390
this guy's healthy.

3145
02:15:15,390 --> 02:15:18,600
It's guys concentrating on his health.
This guy who doesn't smoke pot and just

3146
02:15:18,601 --> 02:15:20,880
eat sugar all day,
this guy's kind of fucked though.

3147
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:21,840
Oh,
that guy's a real fuck.

3148
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:23,100
That guy is fucked.
This guy who,

3149
02:15:23,101 --> 02:15:26,640
who's on adderall because he's got a
prescription for add and you'd have a

3150
02:15:26,641 --> 02:15:28,620
problem with that.
That guy's fucked.

3151
02:15:28,860 --> 02:15:30,840
All these other pieces.
There's a lot of people that are fucked

3152
02:15:30,841 --> 02:15:34,830
out there and these insurance companies
that think that a guy who smokes pot,

3153
02:15:34,831 --> 02:15:38,190
it's more likely to die.
There's no statistics to back that up.

3154
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:41,790
There's no statistics that say that
people smoke pot or more likely to get

3155
02:15:41,791 --> 02:15:46,791
diseases or die of some sort of a
fucking debilitating syndrome that came

3156
02:15:47,611 --> 02:15:50,310
about because of overuse of thc.
It doesn't exist,

3157
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,860
but they're not even testing you for
alcohol.

3158
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:54,031
Didn't even tell.
They tell you,

3159
02:15:54,031 --> 02:15:57,270
ask you how much he drank but not
testing you like they can't test you.

3160
02:15:57,330 --> 02:15:58,410
It's not your system anymore.

3161
02:15:58,610 --> 02:16:01,520
Really strange cause uh,
in the navy and the railroad,

3162
02:16:01,530 --> 02:16:04,960
there were very stringent,
obviously highly stringent drug

3163
02:16:04,961 --> 02:16:06,480
policies,
but you know,

3164
02:16:06,670 --> 02:16:08,590
drinking your ass off every night is
completely fine.

3165
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:09,640
Completely fine.
You know,

3166
02:16:09,700 --> 02:16:11,380
don't,
don't smoke a joint at 5:00 PM,

3167
02:16:11,381 --> 02:16:14,140
but killed that six pack and come in
here and build this train the next

3168
02:16:14,140 --> 02:16:15,130
morning.
You know,

3169
02:16:15,131 --> 02:16:16,720
the,
those were always the guys that made me

3170
02:16:16,721 --> 02:16:17,554
nervous.

3171
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:19,850
Not only that,
there's like a culture of honor behind

3172
02:16:19,851 --> 02:16:21,590
it.
Like how much you can handle your drunk,

3173
02:16:22,230 --> 02:16:23,690
how many,
how much can you handle your drink.

3174
02:16:23,691 --> 02:16:26,030
And Bobby had 17 fucking beers.
A swear to God,

3175
02:16:26,031 --> 02:16:27,350
Bro.
You would think he had zero.

3176
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:30,100
He's right there.
Good for bobby's

3177
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:31,030
an animal.
Yeah.

3178
02:16:31,330 --> 02:16:35,230
Bobby puts him down like there's like a,
a badge of honor that goes to that.

3179
02:16:35,940 --> 02:16:40,840
Bobby's meanwhile he's taking something
that's completely hindering his thought

3180
02:16:40,841 --> 02:16:45,841
process is his stability.
His emotions are all out of whack.

3181
02:16:46,061 --> 02:16:49,420
Like he's fucking drunk as shit.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

3182
02:16:49,740 --> 02:16:51,520
He's,
he's wrestling.

3183
02:16:51,730 --> 02:16:53,980
His brain is wrestling with alcohol
right now,

3184
02:16:53,981 --> 02:16:56,460
which is one of the weirdest depressant,
you know,

3185
02:16:56,810 --> 02:16:58,690
awful.
One of the weirdest drugs.

3186
02:16:59,990 --> 02:17:02,930
It's a [inaudible].
You spend a lot of time on the road

3187
02:17:04,190 --> 02:17:05,510
traveling constantly.
One,

3188
02:17:05,511 --> 02:17:08,090
you can't really drink,
especially at our age,

3189
02:17:08,091 --> 02:17:10,340
it just does things.
But he looked at a room full of people

3190
02:17:10,341 --> 02:17:14,300
every night that are Amazon's really
drunk or like if you work with people.

3191
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:15,710
Yeah,
I don't,

3192
02:17:15,711 --> 02:17:16,700
I refuse to,
I don't,

3193
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:21,820
I don't like really let people drink and
my band on the road and it's cost me

3194
02:17:22,371 --> 02:17:24,980
players cause they'd rather drink than
be in your band and it just,

3195
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:27,530
would you say you don't drink,
can they have a glass of wine with

3196
02:17:27,531 --> 02:17:28,490
dinner?
Well,

3197
02:17:28,491 --> 02:17:29,324
there's,
there's,

3198
02:17:29,330 --> 02:17:30,170
yeah,
well that's like,

3199
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:31,720
you know,
a beer or two to,

3200
02:17:31,770 --> 02:17:33,430
you know,
there's not getting Hondas,

3201
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:36,170
tennis people that shouldn't drink rye.
You know what I mean?

3202
02:17:36,370 --> 02:17:39,380
Like the guy that has one drink and
instantly turns into a different

3203
02:17:39,381 --> 02:17:42,530
motherfucker all together and then by
the time he's on that third one and

3204
02:17:42,531 --> 02:17:43,364
everybody's like,

3205
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:48,080
how much longer we got to do this?
There's a lot of those guys out there

3206
02:17:48,081 --> 02:17:50,390
too.
A lot of people I didn't know that

3207
02:17:50,391 --> 02:17:52,240
existed until,
uh,

3208
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:56,380
the first time I met one one where the
switch goes off and they get your blogs,

3209
02:17:56,450 --> 02:18:00,440
jekyll and Hyde drunk verbalize,
verbalize.

3210
02:18:00,441 --> 02:18:02,660
Wow.
That's a good way to put it out there.

3211
02:18:02,661 --> 02:18:04,550
Like,
and shit gets weird.

3212
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:06,020
Well,
and they're moving around like they're a

3213
02:18:06,021 --> 02:18:09,050
normal,
a woke person Hashtag woke.

3214
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:10,980
Yeah.
This is a,

3215
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:13,910
a weird contradiction we have in this
society.

3216
02:18:13,911 --> 02:18:16,550
We were constantly drinking drugs in the
form of caffeine,

3217
02:18:16,940 --> 02:18:20,540
constantly getting drugs in the form of
whatever your doctor prescribes you for

3218
02:18:21,410 --> 02:18:25,490
depression or anxiety or adhd or
whatever that is.

3219
02:18:25,580 --> 02:18:29,030
Constantly going out and having drinks,
taking drugs,

3220
02:18:29,630 --> 02:18:31,250
the drugs,
being alcohol,

3221
02:18:31,310 --> 02:18:34,490
taking,
taking a whiskey drug and a vodka drug

3222
02:18:34,491 --> 02:18:36,270
and no one,
no one thinks anything of it.

3223
02:18:36,271 --> 02:18:36,681
And they're like,
well,

3224
02:18:36,681 --> 02:18:40,610
I don't do drugs,
drugs all day,

3225
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:42,680
all day.
It's so few people who don't do any

3226
02:18:42,681 --> 02:18:46,570
drugs.
Some drugs are super beneficial.

3227
02:18:46,571 --> 02:18:48,860
I think about that.
Those we'd edibles that made you write

3228
02:18:48,861 --> 02:18:51,110
this album.
That's a beneficial,

3229
02:18:51,680 --> 02:18:52,760
what didn't make you right?
Yeah,

3230
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:54,110
but you were on it when you wrote it.

3231
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:55,630
It was,
oh well I'll give it a little credit.

3232
02:18:55,650 --> 02:18:58,280
I was listening to some old records,
early love and it's like,

3233
02:18:58,730 --> 02:18:59,563
yeah,
that sounds good.

3234
02:19:02,070 --> 02:19:05,310
You could feel music better when you're,
hi Brittany Spears.

3235
02:19:05,311 --> 02:19:06,540
Sounds good.
You got enough,

3236
02:19:06,541 --> 02:19:08,040
man.
You kidding me?

3237
02:19:08,310 --> 02:19:09,280
Turn that shit up.
Like,

3238
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:10,170
yeah,
Brittany.

3239
02:19:11,670 --> 02:19:14,400
God bless her.
I like Miley Cyrus's music while I'm

3240
02:19:14,401 --> 02:19:15,720
high.
I'm going to admit it right now.

3241
02:19:16,530 --> 02:19:18,300
It's Song Malibu.
It's good fucking song,

3242
02:19:18,301 --> 02:19:19,410
man.
It's a good song.

3243
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:20,640
Don't laugh at me.
Jamie

3244
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:26,750
mocks me as if a young herd it young,
cute girl can't be a real artist sign of

3245
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:28,040
a bitch.
Like the first thing

3246
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:31,130
you played in the studio here in the,
in the July super loud.

3247
02:19:31,450 --> 02:19:32,530
Yeah,
I'm serious.

3248
02:19:32,770 --> 02:19:34,880
Oh yeah,
of course.

3249
02:19:34,881 --> 02:19:36,470
And the gentleman was filled with
speakers.

3250
02:19:36,980 --> 02:19:38,740
Good for you.
I want it to uh,

3251
02:19:39,530 --> 02:19:42,740
my name drop real quick cause yesterday
was probably one of those,

3252
02:19:43,580 --> 02:19:44,990
one of those days were like,
yeah,

3253
02:19:45,050 --> 02:19:46,630
this is why I do this.
Um,

3254
02:19:49,030 --> 02:19:53,300
well I ended up going up to Malibu to
Rick Rubin's house and it was playing

3255
02:19:53,301 --> 02:19:55,550
him some of the,
some of this record I'm working on just

3256
02:19:55,551 --> 02:19:58,420
to get some feedback.
And it's one of those moments when you

3257
02:19:58,421 --> 02:20:02,060
like,
you realize you're sitting like Rick

3258
02:20:02,060 --> 02:20:04,880
Rubin's like all engine stolen.
His cows head banging like a fucking

3259
02:20:04,881 --> 02:20:09,350
cave man.
And he had literally the best sounding

3260
02:20:09,830 --> 02:20:12,500
stereo system I've ever heard in my
life.

3261
02:20:12,660 --> 02:20:15,950
Could only imagine,
I mean better than any top Ray's studio

3262
02:20:15,951 --> 02:20:17,390
monitors I've ever sat in front of.

3263
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:19,860
It was just like,
Yup,

3264
02:20:22,480 --> 02:20:24,960
it's really Rick Ruben too.
That's the other is the coolest part was

3265
02:20:24,970 --> 02:20:28,610
that was the only thing that was in the
fucking room was the couch.

3266
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:31,610
He was like literally like the Tiki,
a guy sitting in the chair in front of

3267
02:20:31,611 --> 02:20:32,241
this town,
you know,

3268
02:20:32,241 --> 02:20:36,350
it's like just the stereo on the floor
and this is fucking empty room and I

3269
02:20:36,351 --> 02:20:38,270
don't know what it was or what the
speakers even were.

3270
02:20:38,271 --> 02:20:42,320
I'd never seen anything like it,
but I bet it's like when Mason's has

3271
02:20:42,470 --> 02:20:44,540
Henry Rollins says these speakers we
were talking about the other day,

3272
02:20:44,541 --> 02:20:46,370
they're like a quarter million dollars.
Is that what they were?

3273
02:20:47,340 --> 02:20:50,150
Quarter million dollar speakers in his
living room these days.

3274
02:20:50,151 --> 02:20:51,470
Towers,
these two towers.

3275
02:20:51,890 --> 02:20:53,450
And they just,
I mean,

3276
02:20:53,451 --> 02:20:55,310
I've never,
I've never experienced it,

3277
02:20:55,550 --> 02:20:59,120
so I don't know what it's like,
but I got to assume that you've spent a

3278
02:20:59,120 --> 02:20:59,953
quarter million dollars for some
speakers.

3279
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:02,090
I thought,
I thought I'd heard some pretty

3280
02:21:02,091 --> 02:21:04,250
impressive speakers in my time,
but this was like,

3281
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:08,720
like some really holy shit.
This exists kind of moment.

3282
02:21:08,750 --> 02:21:09,470
Right,
right.

3283
02:21:09,470 --> 02:21:11,540
It makes sense.
It doesn't even have to be that loud.

3284
02:21:11,541 --> 02:21:13,670
Right.
It's just that the sound is so powerful.

3285
02:21:13,671 --> 02:21:14,500
Right?
Yeah.

3286
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:15,770
The only thing,
I don't want a car,

3287
02:21:15,771 --> 02:21:18,110
I want,
I want a Samurai sword and written

3288
02:21:18,111 --> 02:21:19,410
Ruben's home stereo.
That's,

3289
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:24,520
that's what I'm aspiring to now at a
Bronco and the light Saber Bronco

3290
02:21:24,530 --> 02:21:25,180
lightsaber.
Yeah.

3291
02:21:25,180 --> 02:21:26,320
I gave,
I had a bronc out,

3292
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:28,940
a bad ass bronco.
My second one we moved,

3293
02:21:28,941 --> 02:21:30,940
we moved to Nashville and Bronco.
My wife,

3294
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:34,700
my wife's,
it died and I ended up scoring a sweet

3295
02:21:34,701 --> 02:21:36,650
one,
this redneck and Livingston,

3296
02:21:36,651 --> 02:21:38,300
Tennessee or somewhere a borrow from
him.

3297
02:21:38,860 --> 02:21:42,280
It was a [inaudible] 92 and he'd like,
Matt blacked it out.

3298
02:21:42,300 --> 02:21:45,530
My buddy bobby took it for like a month
while I was on tour in Europe and

3299
02:21:45,830 --> 02:21:47,120
stripped all the interior out.

3300
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:49,910
We rhino hide the entire liner,
took all the,

3301
02:21:49,970 --> 02:21:51,080
all the plastic,
everything.

3302
02:21:51,081 --> 02:21:53,150
It was just like a fucking Mad Max death
trap.

3303
02:21:53,151 --> 02:21:55,430
And we had these bucket cold beer,
leather racing seats.

3304
02:21:55,431 --> 02:21:56,970
We bolted in.
Oh.

3305
02:21:57,260 --> 02:21:59,360
And then I had two kids and mom and it
was like,

3306
02:21:59,900 --> 02:22:03,750
I'm going to die driving in this thing
and had a 400 wins or rebuild with

3307
02:22:04,140 --> 02:22:05,660
Kansas header is the whole God damn
thing.

3308
02:22:05,661 --> 02:22:07,460
Like when neighbors hated it.
And,

3309
02:22:07,461 --> 02:22:09,380
um,
I gave it to my drummer when his truck

3310
02:22:09,381 --> 02:22:14,000
died and he actually liked,
unlike most kids of the millennial era,

3311
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:16,940
really put time and money and effort and
work into,

3312
02:22:16,941 --> 02:22:18,620
it was like fixing it up and making it
his,

3313
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:20,870
and then he's getting married so he's
getting a tree,

3314
02:22:20,871 --> 02:22:22,910
got a real trucks.
Now that Bronco is gone.

3315
02:22:22,950 --> 02:22:25,770
I feel like it's probably time to find a
sweet bronco.

3316
02:22:25,830 --> 02:22:28,680
Yeah.
That's a good era to the ojs bronco year

3317
02:22:28,681 --> 02:22:30,600
is more understated Bronco.
Yup.

3318
02:22:30,750 --> 02:22:34,050
The locking hubs,
the move is to get one of those and keep

3319
02:22:34,051 --> 02:22:37,340
it plain Jane on the outside.
But on the inside just put a battery.

3320
02:22:38,070 --> 02:22:42,360
That's where I really want to do is uh,
um,

3321
02:22:42,390 --> 02:22:43,920
cause I don't,
I'd like to have,

3322
02:22:43,921 --> 02:22:45,330
so yeah,
it's very unassuming.

3323
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:48,600
And then on the inside,
just look like a rocket ship with all

3324
02:22:48,601 --> 02:22:51,750
the accoutrement that can be done
easily.

3325
02:22:51,990 --> 02:22:54,510
Um,
and very modernized,

3326
02:22:54,511 --> 02:22:56,040
user friendly,
but they give you what you're going to

3327
02:22:56,041 --> 02:22:56,910
pay to do that.
Man,

3328
02:22:56,911 --> 02:22:59,190
you could fucking go by 1970 [inaudible]
or something.

3329
02:22:59,450 --> 02:23:00,690
You can buy a house,
right?

3330
02:23:00,750 --> 02:23:02,880
Yeah.
You could buy a house where you live for

3331
02:23:02,881 --> 02:23:04,680
real.
Yeah.

3332
02:23:04,830 --> 02:23:07,140
By a fat piece of land.
Actually Nashville,

3333
02:23:07,141 --> 02:23:10,350
the real estate has gotten pretty crazy.
I don't live in Nashville anymore,

3334
02:23:10,351 --> 02:23:13,740
but uh,
I don't know it much like Austin.

3335
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:17,760
I mean five years from now there may not
be any music in Nashville cause I don't

3336
02:23:17,761 --> 02:23:19,470
know how many musicians are gonna afford
to live there.

3337
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:20,713
Yeah.
That's why I keep,

3338
02:23:20,780 --> 02:23:22,860
it's so fast,
like an explosion,

3339
02:23:22,861 --> 02:23:24,960
an explosion.
And it logistically in the

3340
02:23:24,961 --> 02:23:27,390
infrastructure of the traffic,
it's like a marriage reversion la.

3341
02:23:27,391 --> 02:23:30,330
Now when did it start?
Hard to say.

3342
02:23:30,331 --> 02:23:31,080
I mean,
I are,

3343
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:35,170
the first time I lived there it was in
2005 and it was a different city than

3344
02:23:35,171 --> 02:23:37,140
none of this had happened.
Um,

3345
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:40,020
a lot of the hip bars now,
like that could have been eight people

3346
02:23:40,021 --> 02:23:41,550
in there on a Friday night.
Um,

3347
02:23:42,180 --> 02:23:47,180
I'm not really sure.
I moved there 2011 and I think it was

3348
02:23:48,161 --> 02:23:50,190
right in the last two or three years.
The,

3349
02:23:50,290 --> 02:23:53,970
or all the gentrification started around
there and they were building these,

3350
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:55,860
you know,
what used to be the blown out

3351
02:23:55,861 --> 02:23:57,680
dilapidated parts of town in the high
rises,

3352
02:23:57,720 --> 02:23:59,190
started going up and,
and,

3353
02:23:59,300 --> 02:24:01,440
and shopping centers and that sort of
thing.

3354
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:04,440
And uh,
and there's still very much the old

3355
02:24:04,441 --> 02:24:05,430
Nashville,
it was just,

3356
02:24:05,510 --> 02:24:08,340
it's almost like two or three different
cities in some cases in terms of

3357
02:24:08,341 --> 02:24:13,341
personality.
But the influx and all this change is

3358
02:24:13,351 --> 02:24:15,690
sort of changed what it,
what it is.

3359
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:18,780
But like Austin used to be a thriving
music scene,

3360
02:24:18,781 --> 02:24:21,540
but now it's like all the tech industry
moves down to the cost of living and

3361
02:24:21,541 --> 02:24:24,870
properties.
Just insane.

3362
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:29,160
Like struggling service industry job day
to day as we say,

3363
02:24:29,161 --> 02:24:30,870
artists,
people trying to make it can't,

3364
02:24:31,260 --> 02:24:34,380
they're all having to live like an hour
outside of town and commute in for the

3365
02:24:34,381 --> 02:24:36,000
gigs.
Wow.

3366
02:24:38,390 --> 02:24:39,900
That's crazy.
And what did,

3367
02:24:39,901 --> 02:24:41,430
what do you think was the catalyst?
Like what,

3368
02:24:41,431 --> 02:24:44,780
what caused the launch became a cool
place to be.

3369
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:46,460
Okay.

3370
02:24:46,460 --> 02:24:47,181
Yeah.
I mean the,

3371
02:24:47,181 --> 02:24:48,480
well there was,
there was a,

3372
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:51,171
I'm not sure.
Well,

3373
02:24:51,171 --> 02:24:53,390
it terms of what's always been a
publishing hub,

3374
02:24:53,540 --> 02:24:53,870
right?
No,

3375
02:24:53,870 --> 02:24:55,130
it's not.
I mean it's a music town,

3376
02:24:55,131 --> 02:24:56,750
but there's,
and there's all kinds of music.

3377
02:24:56,751 --> 02:25:00,080
They're not just country music,
but about when did that TV show come

3378
02:25:00,081 --> 02:25:02,630
out?
There was a big Nashville TV show that

3379
02:25:02,631 --> 02:25:04,070
would have been about four or five years
ago.

3380
02:25:04,220 --> 02:25:06,230
Do you think that fucked it up.
All those Dorks,

3381
02:25:06,231 --> 02:25:06,791
they go,
Whoa,

3382
02:25:06,791 --> 02:25:07,910
go to live there.
Well,

3383
02:25:07,911 --> 02:25:10,160
I mean there's definitely tours from
that TV show,

3384
02:25:10,470 --> 02:25:11,810
kind of a match.
Mason Jar.

3385
02:25:11,870 --> 02:25:16,790
It's such a soap opera version that
isn't really that far enough away from

3386
02:25:16,791 --> 02:25:19,670
how that world probably works.
I never saw it.

3387
02:25:19,730 --> 02:25:22,250
I didn't either watch them.
My wife watched it one night and I just

3388
02:25:22,251 --> 02:25:23,084
was like,

3389
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:29,250
no,
I've been there a bunch of times playing

3390
02:25:29,281 --> 02:25:30,114
xannies

3391
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:31,131
done.
Okay.

3392
02:25:31,131 --> 02:25:34,400
Now that little street where you're
talking about that corner on eighth

3393
02:25:34,401 --> 02:25:36,260
avenue,
they're xannies.

3394
02:25:36,590 --> 02:25:40,190
You got doug was corner.
Then there's like some,

3395
02:25:40,430 --> 02:25:43,250
there's a lot of shops that I go to on
Sundays there,

3396
02:25:43,260 --> 02:25:44,360
the auctioneers.
I was like,

3397
02:25:44,361 --> 02:25:45,750
dude,
he's the oldest state sales and then

3398
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:47,930
really cool furniture.
But that little pocket,

3399
02:25:47,931 --> 02:25:52,931
that intersection is probably one of the
few remaining bastions of funk left in

3400
02:25:54,891 --> 02:25:56,630
Nashville.
Like that's probably my favorite little

3401
02:25:56,631 --> 02:25:59,630
corner in Nashville cause I can just
stand there and it still feels like

3402
02:26:00,110 --> 02:26:03,440
relatively similar to what it probably
felt like 30 years ago.

3403
02:26:04,130 --> 02:26:05,970
You know what I mean?
Um,

3404
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:11,300
but a lot of other things change around
things that don't.

3405
02:26:11,301 --> 02:26:12,980
Does that make sense?
It does make sense.

3406
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:15,470
Yeah.
Those are cool little pockets then,

3407
02:26:15,471 --> 02:26:16,304
right?
Yeah.

3408
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:18,860
I think I got a good friend Billy Wayne
Davis.

3409
02:26:18,861 --> 02:26:20,270
I met him at xannies

3410
02:26:21,490 --> 02:26:23,610
one night back when I was on twitter.
He was,

3411
02:26:23,830 --> 02:26:25,570
he reached out like a plane here
tonight,

3412
02:26:25,571 --> 02:26:26,980
free tickets.
So my wife and I went,

3413
02:26:26,981 --> 02:26:30,150
we liked comedy and got to know him and
they ended up opening a tour.

3414
02:26:30,200 --> 02:26:35,170
Forming that place is one of those
places where you know it's good and old

3415
02:26:35,171 --> 02:26:37,300
based on the number of dead people on
the wall.

3416
02:26:37,450 --> 02:26:39,140
Right.
So you're just walking around and you

3417
02:26:39,141 --> 02:26:40,050
let go up Richard,
Jenny,

3418
02:26:40,051 --> 02:26:42,140
you can walk in and taste cocaine.
Yeah,

3419
02:26:42,480 --> 02:26:43,313
it's,
you know,

3420
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:43,781
well,
I mean,

3421
02:26:43,781 --> 02:26:45,530
the photos,
the head shots,

3422
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:46,750
right.
A dead comedians.

3423
02:26:46,780 --> 02:26:48,640
There's so many of them.
You know,

3424
02:26:48,641 --> 02:26:50,620
that place has been around for ever,
aren't you?

3425
02:26:50,621 --> 02:26:51,720
Coming to Nashville?
So,

3426
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:52,990
yeah,
like a couple of weeks.

3427
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:54,730
What day?
I don't know.

3428
02:26:56,140 --> 02:26:59,440
I should probably know.
I'm doing the Ryman on,

3429
02:26:59,441 --> 02:27:01,150
um,
the 30th,

3430
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:02,081
30th,
yeah,

3431
02:27:02,081 --> 02:27:05,290
the 30th on the Ryman with the Golden
Pony,

3432
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:06,153
Tony Hinchcliffe.

3433
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:08,830
Then we're in Charlotte the next night.
That's what I like.

3434
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:10,360
A little short weekends.
Bang,

3435
02:27:10,361 --> 02:27:11,650
Bang.
Four shows,

3436
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:12,520
two shows Friday,
two shirts.

3437
02:27:12,521 --> 02:27:13,360
Saturday.
Have you done,

3438
02:27:13,380 --> 02:27:14,890
have you done the ramen before?
Yeah,

3439
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:16,120
a couple of times.
Yeah.

3440
02:27:16,480 --> 02:27:17,170
Yeah.
I love it.

3441
02:27:17,170 --> 02:27:18,390
It's fucking off.
It'll be out of town,

3442
02:27:18,391 --> 02:27:19,224
man.
I'm bummed.

3443
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:21,040
What are you going to do?
What are you gonna do?

3444
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:24,400
Like in that book?
I'm always coming through,

3445
02:27:24,670 --> 02:27:27,700
come through like once every year.
It'd be a year and a half at most.

3446
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:30,100
I love it.
I might come through again and do

3447
02:27:30,110 --> 02:27:32,230
xannies um,
after this,

3448
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:34,270
when I write my new hour just to fuck
around,

3449
02:27:34,271 --> 02:27:37,720
stretch it out because you really want
to stretch it out at a comedy club.

3450
02:27:37,721 --> 02:27:39,700
You don't want to stretch it out in
front of 3000 people.

3451
02:27:39,701 --> 02:27:42,520
It's just not,
it's not a good sign of good,

3452
02:27:42,521 --> 02:27:44,170
uh,
development ground.

3453
02:27:44,230 --> 02:27:47,020
It's not the room to try things out.
The big rooms in the room,

3454
02:27:47,440 --> 02:27:49,270
that's when you're done.
You got it.

3455
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:51,250
You got the set.
You know what you're doing,

3456
02:27:51,251 --> 02:27:53,950
you fuck around while you're up there,
but you basically have a structure for

3457
02:27:53,951 --> 02:27:56,020
your act.
You have a structure for each bit and

3458
02:27:56,021 --> 02:27:59,950
occasionally y'all deviate.
But what I don't want to do,

3459
02:27:59,980 --> 02:28:02,830
I don't want to work out brand new
material in front of 3000 people.

3460
02:28:02,831 --> 02:28:03,670
Fuck that

3461
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:04,751
one night.
Well,

3462
02:28:04,751 --> 02:28:06,700
I think what came to watch your show at
the store?

3463
02:28:07,110 --> 02:28:08,290
Yeah.
And this was,

3464
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:10,780
uh,
like a year ago and you had to jet right

3465
02:28:10,781 --> 02:28:12,630
after the set and go to Pasadena for
another set.

3466
02:28:13,130 --> 02:28:15,610
My buddy that I brought with me,
we were going to hang here,

3467
02:28:16,690 --> 02:28:19,630
see who comes out and like Jeff Ross or
somebody comes out and he's doing his

3468
02:28:19,631 --> 02:28:21,230
bit and right in the fucking middle of
it,

3469
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:26,090
the back curtain opens and Chappelle
walks out and just kind of like taps

3470
02:28:26,091 --> 02:28:27,950
were also on the corner on the shoulder
like fuck off,

3471
02:28:27,951 --> 02:28:28,820
I got this,
you know,

3472
02:28:28,850 --> 02:28:31,880
and just jacks the mic and pretty much
everybody else has set who was supposed

3473
02:28:31,881 --> 02:28:34,460
to perform that night.
And he stands there for like three

3474
02:28:34,461 --> 02:28:35,294
hours,
man,

3475
02:28:35,890 --> 02:28:36,800
just sitting there,
I was like,

3476
02:28:36,801 --> 02:28:38,510
dude,
this will probably never happen again in

3477
02:28:38,511 --> 02:28:40,880
your lifetime so I'm not fucking
leaving.

3478
02:28:41,330 --> 02:28:45,020
And we just sat through the whole time
and he sat there rocking Tequila bombs

3479
02:28:45,021 --> 02:28:49,100
and get drunk and just really talking.
There were times where it was the

3480
02:28:49,101 --> 02:28:51,410
funniest thing I've ever seen,
literally.

3481
02:28:51,411 --> 02:28:53,540
And there were times where like it kind
of got dark and you're like,

3482
02:28:53,550 --> 02:28:55,490
where's the fuck's happening?
Where's this going?

3483
02:28:55,790 --> 02:28:59,480
And he was working things out.
And then later on those netflix specials

3484
02:28:59,481 --> 02:29:01,070
land.
And I realize I've already heard like

3485
02:29:01,071 --> 02:29:05,000
90% of these jokes and cause the guy was
just saying I'm going to go hijack the

3486
02:29:05,001 --> 02:29:06,980
main room,
work my shit out.

3487
02:29:06,981 --> 02:29:08,660
Cause I got it like that.
I'm Dave Chappelle,

3488
02:29:08,661 --> 02:29:10,280
you know,
but it was fucking amazing.

3489
02:29:10,380 --> 02:29:14,640
Yeah he does that a lot where he'll just
drop it into place and just do a set and

3490
02:29:14,641 --> 02:29:16,890
that's,
that's how he kind of works as material

3491
02:29:16,891 --> 02:29:18,150
out.
You know,

3492
02:29:18,600 --> 02:29:22,300
he just kind of drops in and keeps
tweaking it and it,

3493
02:29:22,440 --> 02:29:24,210
it's,
it's if he has a structure,

3494
02:29:24,211 --> 02:29:24,601
right?
Like,

3495
02:29:24,601 --> 02:29:26,730
if he has a few ideas that he's talking
about,

3496
02:29:27,330 --> 02:29:30,600
he can just riff.
And especially if he's drinking,

3497
02:29:30,601 --> 02:29:33,720
just go on stage and then the drinking
and then he's always got dudes behind

3498
02:29:33,721 --> 02:29:37,350
them that are taken down notes,
letting them know like all you talked

3499
02:29:37,351 --> 02:29:40,140
about this day,
and I'm sure they record it too.

3500
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:44,520
And they'll go over it and eventually
boil it down to like what that Netflix

3501
02:29:44,521 --> 02:29:49,440
special was the two Netflix back that
shows you how prolific that dude is to

3502
02:29:49,441 --> 02:29:53,250
put out a Netflix special and then a
year later put out to Netflix specials,

3503
02:29:53,251 --> 02:29:53,880
right?

3504
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:55,680
And then Netflix is like,
we'll take it what he got.

3505
02:29:55,681 --> 02:29:56,341
And he was like,
Hey,

3506
02:29:56,341 --> 02:30:00,480
I wrote this one this month and I'd like
to put it down for all eternity.

3507
02:30:00,510 --> 02:30:03,810
He cool with that.
But most people like you write something

3508
02:30:03,811 --> 02:30:08,160
and it's a good solid year before you
even consider putting it in a special,

3509
02:30:08,370 --> 02:30:09,840
you know,
some guys were doing like a special

3510
02:30:09,841 --> 02:30:12,870
year,
but too much of it was like half cooked.

3511
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:15,120
It was like if you just waited six more
months,

3512
02:30:15,121 --> 02:30:17,430
this thing would be like an all time
great special.

3513
02:30:17,490 --> 02:30:20,070
But instead you're banging them out one
a year.

3514
02:30:20,071 --> 02:30:22,800
You never get the essence of the thing.

3515
02:30:22,850 --> 02:30:26,780
Well his thing too,
he part of his thing I think is is

3516
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:31,580
making it look like it's so easy because
the night at the comedy store and it

3517
02:30:31,581 --> 02:30:33,320
just like,
it did feel like he was just sort of

3518
02:30:33,321 --> 02:30:36,030
making this shit up on the spot and then
you see the netflix specials in,

3519
02:30:36,031 --> 02:30:39,590
it sort of feels the same way.
Like he's just being dave and be like,

3520
02:30:39,591 --> 02:30:43,940
he would was a little subtle things that
I noticed like probably 10 times

3521
02:30:43,941 --> 02:30:47,930
throughout the night.
It really awkward moments.

3522
02:30:47,931 --> 02:30:50,330
He would call the waitress to get him
another drink,

3523
02:30:50,331 --> 02:30:52,490
but he would,
he would only say borrow whore.

3524
02:30:53,330 --> 02:30:55,670
And every time you say it they get a
little,

3525
02:30:55,730 --> 02:30:58,670
a little more awkward,
like a little less appropriate each and

3526
02:30:58,671 --> 02:31:00,270
every fucking town.
We're probably like it.

3527
02:31:00,290 --> 02:31:01,850
Eventually everybody in the room was
like,

3528
02:31:01,970 --> 02:31:05,000
that's not really cool.
And then at the end of the night,

3529
02:31:05,001 --> 02:31:06,280
he's like,
the last thing he says like,

3530
02:31:06,740 --> 02:31:09,200
I'm really sorry,
I called you bar hourage don't have any

3531
02:31:09,201 --> 02:31:11,030
fucking jokes.
And he walked off the stage.

3532
02:31:11,210 --> 02:31:12,043
It was like,

3533
02:31:14,150 --> 02:31:15,650
yeah,
that's how Dave writes.

3534
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:18,170
That's one of the ways he writes.
But he's,

3535
02:31:18,171 --> 02:31:19,590
um,
he's got it down,

3536
02:31:19,620 --> 02:31:20,100
you know,
he's

3537
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:22,740
got it down to a science and the other
thing he does is he just travels to

3538
02:31:22,741 --> 02:31:24,910
towns,
just decides to travel to a town and

3539
02:31:24,911 --> 02:31:26,580
then go on stage,
show up.

3540
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:28,710
I'll feel more.
Yeah.

3541
02:31:28,711 --> 02:31:29,640
But I mean,
he doesn't even,

3542
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:31,080
he'll do that,
but that's booked.

3543
02:31:31,081 --> 02:31:33,590
He books that you have to craft a book
that shit nine months.

3544
02:31:33,710 --> 02:31:35,850
Right.
Like if he works somewhere else,

3545
02:31:35,851 --> 02:31:38,220
he just shows up.
Like he'll work at a comedy club and

3546
02:31:38,221 --> 02:31:39,120
just show up.
Gotcha.

3547
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:41,100
You know,
it's like I was in Denver wants and he

3548
02:31:41,101 --> 02:31:43,230
just showed up.
I came in the green room after the show.

3549
02:31:43,590 --> 02:31:45,180
It was a,
after the late show,

3550
02:31:45,181 --> 02:31:48,070
Friday night,
I went backstage and Dave's in the green

3551
02:31:48,071 --> 02:31:48,481
room.
I go,

3552
02:31:48,481 --> 02:31:49,860
what are you doing man?
And,

3553
02:31:49,861 --> 02:31:50,491
uh,
I think it goes,

3554
02:31:50,491 --> 02:31:53,580
hey Joe Downs fucking around here.
You want to go on stage?

3555
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:54,241
He's like,
shit,

3556
02:31:54,241 --> 02:31:54,750
I ain't go fuck.

3557
02:31:54,750 --> 02:31:56,010
Yeah.
I grabbed them,

3558
02:31:56,040 --> 02:31:57,930
bring the people back in.
People were already getting up and

3559
02:31:57,931 --> 02:31:58,764
leaving.
I said,

3560
02:31:58,850 --> 02:32:00,330
ladies and gentlemen,
get back.

3561
02:32:00,450 --> 02:32:03,420
Dave Chappelle's here.
Of course he wants to go on stage as

3562
02:32:03,421 --> 02:32:04,950
well.
This is he there twice.

3563
02:32:04,951 --> 02:32:06,720
It's what he does.
He does his thing,

3564
02:32:06,721 --> 02:32:08,100
you know,
but it's just weird to say like,

3565
02:32:08,130 --> 02:32:11,460
oh like this guy is so free.
He could just fly into a town where he

3566
02:32:11,461 --> 02:32:13,770
knows his friends are going to be,
he doesn't even have to call you in

3567
02:32:13,771 --> 02:32:14,730
advance,
you know,

3568
02:32:14,731 --> 02:32:16,590
he just flew in and I see him like,
Oh yeah,

3569
02:32:16,591 --> 02:32:17,760
get up there.
Like he's,

3570
02:32:18,030 --> 02:32:21,600
he's his free as a bird.
He does like whatever he wants and then

3571
02:32:21,601 --> 02:32:24,990
he does these netflix specials,
they pay my ass load of money and then

3572
02:32:24,991 --> 02:32:29,610
he just does shows whenever he wants to.
But his creative process is like almost

3573
02:32:29,611 --> 02:32:33,780
like engineered around being loose,
like doing whatever he wants,

3574
02:32:33,781 --> 02:32:34,800
go on where he wants to go.

3575
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:38,100
Doing what every once and then writing,
you know,

3576
02:32:38,101 --> 02:32:41,430
and then figuring out on then riff in it
and just fucking around.

3577
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:44,010
It's fascinating.
Fascinating to watch.

3578
02:32:44,830 --> 02:32:46,050
It's like jazz almost.
Oh,

3579
02:32:46,051 --> 02:32:47,610
it's very much like,
yeah.

3580
02:32:47,611 --> 02:32:51,810
I mean he's um,
he's also got B and Dave Chappelle down

3581
02:32:51,811 --> 02:32:53,820
to a science.
Like you were saying that you are in the

3582
02:32:53,821 --> 02:32:56,700
sturgill simpson business.
He's in the Dave Chappelle business.

3583
02:32:56,701 --> 02:32:57,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

3584
02:32:58,390 --> 02:33:01,140
It does what Dave Chappelle wants to do.
That's the key,

3585
02:33:01,141 --> 02:33:02,490
I think.
I think that's the key.

3586
02:33:02,491 --> 02:33:05,760
If we could all be in the business of
whoever the fuck you are,

3587
02:33:06,390 --> 02:33:11,390
whatever you do well is I like to write
songs and make rutgers and pretty much

3588
02:33:11,711 --> 02:33:12,840
say no to everything.

3589
02:33:15,150 --> 02:33:20,150
I think that's a good life.
Dave seems to be on a,

3590
02:33:20,431 --> 02:33:22,800
on a much grander scale.
You ain't like yourself.

3591
02:33:22,801 --> 02:33:25,230
I mean,
is there any point of the day,

3592
02:33:25,231 --> 02:33:27,510
were you ever do anything you don't want
to do?

3593
02:33:28,110 --> 02:33:28,980
No.
Not Anymore.

3594
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:30,541
No.
I mean,

3595
02:33:30,541 --> 02:33:32,880
I do things that I know I have to do
that I'm not looking forward to,

3596
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:36,720
but that's mostly like exercise shit.
Right.

3597
02:33:37,080 --> 02:33:38,430
You know,
like sometimes I'm just not looking

3598
02:33:38,431 --> 02:33:41,910
forward to it and I have to force myself
to do it or writing.

3599
02:33:41,970 --> 02:33:44,070
I love writing,
but sometimes I have to force myself to

3600
02:33:44,071 --> 02:33:46,710
sit down in front of the computer.
But other than that,

3601
02:33:46,730 --> 02:33:48,480
like I know it on a computer.
Yeah.

3602
02:33:48,810 --> 02:33:49,650
Really?
Yeah.

3603
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:51,390
I can't,
uh,

3604
02:33:51,391 --> 02:33:52,380
write,
uh,

3605
02:33:52,381 --> 02:33:54,480
write by hand too,
but when I write by hand,

3606
02:33:54,481 --> 02:33:57,660
it's really just rehashing things right.
When I ride on a computer,

3607
02:33:57,661 --> 02:34:02,310
I see there's no way I can write with my
hands as quickly as I can type.

3608
02:34:02,490 --> 02:34:04,500
I can type pretty quick.
So if I'm,

3609
02:34:04,501 --> 02:34:06,810
if I have an idea and I don't want to
hear my voice,

3610
02:34:06,870 --> 02:34:08,550
so I don't want to say it into a
microphone,

3611
02:34:08,910 --> 02:34:12,000
I want to just figure out what the beats
are of things.

3612
02:34:12,090 --> 02:34:13,350
Interesting.
Yeah.

3613
02:34:13,351 --> 02:34:16,170
Well I was gonna say that I always write
by hand because

3614
02:34:18,770 --> 02:34:23,000
usually the meter or the phrasing,
there's a way it makes me think about

3615
02:34:23,001 --> 02:34:25,850
it.
It goes down right the first time or as

3616
02:34:25,851 --> 02:34:29,270
opposed to them just like writing poetry
on a computer screen or whatever,

3617
02:34:29,271 --> 02:34:31,710
you know,
you don't necessarily have a sense of

3618
02:34:31,711 --> 02:34:32,544
uh,
the beat,

3619
02:34:33,140 --> 02:34:35,930
whereas like I want things to flow a
certain way and land on,

3620
02:34:36,770 --> 02:34:39,590
on hits and that and I usually just like
throw all the continents away.

3621
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:41,513
Hmm.

3622
02:34:41,870 --> 02:34:44,930
You know,
Bill Clinton wrote his entire memoir on

3623
02:34:44,931 --> 02:34:46,520
um,
like legal paper.

3624
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:48,890
It doesn't surprise me.
He wrote it on lecture.

3625
02:34:49,090 --> 02:34:51,610
They go,
what's your writing as well?

3626
02:34:52,250 --> 02:34:54,650
I think he wrote it on like a regular
notebook,

3627
02:34:56,040 --> 02:34:57,560
like maybe one of those,
uh,

3628
02:34:58,170 --> 02:35:00,560
black and white ones that used to get
when you were with the,

3629
02:35:00,570 --> 02:35:04,890
with the splatter recovers stacks of
those things the best.

3630
02:35:05,310 --> 02:35:08,310
I still reach out to those when I write.
I,

3631
02:35:08,311 --> 02:35:10,710
uh,
when I write on a piece of paper,

3632
02:35:10,711 --> 02:35:12,960
I'm really just reminded myself most of
the time.

3633
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:16,470
Occasionally I have an idea that I have
to like circle and I put an x next to it

3634
02:35:16,471 --> 02:35:18,580
and it's all slow.
But if you read my notebook,

3635
02:35:18,590 --> 02:35:20,880
you think I was a crazy person.
There's something to that too.

3636
02:35:20,881 --> 02:35:25,620
In terms of memory,
like if I learned a long time ago,

3637
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:29,220
if there's a song I want to learn and
you got to remember all the words,

3638
02:35:29,730 --> 02:35:31,590
uh,
I'm never going to remember him until I

3639
02:35:31,591 --> 02:35:34,890
just sit down and write that song down
on paper.

3640
02:35:34,950 --> 02:35:37,410
Like one time.
Once I write it on paper and see it,

3641
02:35:37,411 --> 02:35:38,244
it's like it's there.

3642
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:39,480
Yup.
Yup.

3643
02:35:39,960 --> 02:35:42,870
And like whether it's mine or somebody,
I only forget the words to the shit I

3644
02:35:42,871 --> 02:35:43,471
write.
Weirdly.

3645
02:35:43,471 --> 02:35:46,740
That's kind of like,
and shows it never fails.

3646
02:35:46,830 --> 02:35:50,150
If I get lost or forget something,
it's always a song I wrote.

3647
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:53,850
Never really 8,000 old country and
bluegrass songs like would just pull out

3648
02:35:53,851 --> 02:35:55,740
of my ass on a diamond,
remember all that shit.

3649
02:35:55,741 --> 02:35:58,170
But it's always the ones I wrote.
I wonder why.

3650
02:35:58,230 --> 02:35:59,100
I don't know.
Man.

3651
02:35:59,770 --> 02:36:01,560
That's interesting.
That makes sense to elect,

3652
02:36:01,561 --> 02:36:02,940
right?
Because the other ones that you

3653
02:36:02,941 --> 02:36:05,190
remember,
they just had an impact on you.

3654
02:36:05,430 --> 02:36:07,530
Like they mean something to you or it's
the one you wrote,

3655
02:36:07,531 --> 02:36:11,310
like he like comes out of nowhere.
It goes through you to your pad.

3656
02:36:11,670 --> 02:36:12,870
Right?
It's like,

3657
02:36:13,050 --> 02:36:16,730
it's almost hard to recapture that state
and then you're like a normal person

3658
02:36:16,750 --> 02:36:19,080
trying to remember what you thought of
when you were in that zone.

3659
02:36:19,950 --> 02:36:21,810
Whereas if it was a song that somebody
else made.

3660
02:36:22,170 --> 02:36:22,650
Yeah.
Like,

3661
02:36:22,650 --> 02:36:23,490
Oh,
I love the song.

3662
02:36:23,530 --> 02:36:25,350
I know.
I don't know if it's like,

3663
02:36:25,351 --> 02:36:28,530
because you're reacting to it strongly
more strongly.

3664
02:36:28,560 --> 02:36:29,730
I mean,
uh,

3665
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:33,690
well this is,
I think there's a thing of creativity

3666
02:36:33,720 --> 02:36:36,030
that involves the no self,
right?

3667
02:36:36,450 --> 02:36:37,980
There's that state that you get when
you,

3668
02:36:37,990 --> 02:36:40,260
oh,
there's a lot of shit that I write where

3669
02:36:40,261 --> 02:36:42,270
I go back over it.
Like,

3670
02:36:42,410 --> 02:36:43,800
Mike,
how can I write that bit out?

3671
02:36:44,010 --> 02:36:46,830
And then I'd go back and read it and I
don't remember any of this.

3672
02:36:47,130 --> 02:36:48,240
Half of it.
I don't remember.

3673
02:36:48,241 --> 02:36:50,210
I took us the hard,
the hardest part though,

3674
02:36:50,211 --> 02:36:52,680
those getting to that lack of self.
Yeah.

3675
02:36:52,710 --> 02:36:56,730
I mean even I think that's with any art
when you're not thinking about it or

3676
02:36:56,731 --> 02:37:00,870
self aware or have any preconceived
notions about where it wants to go.

3677
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:02,130
Yeah.
You know,

3678
02:37:02,310 --> 02:37:03,240
do you smoke weed and,
right.

3679
02:37:05,800 --> 02:37:06,220
Okay.

3680
02:37:06,220 --> 02:37:09,970
I don't ever like do one way or another.
Specifically,

3681
02:37:09,971 --> 02:37:12,710
I'm just,
whatever I have written while I'm high

3682
02:37:12,770 --> 02:37:13,630
written one,
I'm not,

3683
02:37:13,631 --> 02:37:15,500
you know,
what about performing

3684
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:17,450
generally?
I don't enjoy,

3685
02:37:17,630 --> 02:37:19,310
it depends.
I can't,

3686
02:37:19,520 --> 02:37:21,680
I don't,
I don't really like to smoke weed

3687
02:37:21,681 --> 02:37:23,810
anymore.
It's something about the way it hits me

3688
02:37:24,230 --> 02:37:27,690
when I inhale it and hide.
It becomes more heady and internalize

3689
02:37:27,691 --> 02:37:30,170
and like any anxiety or the paranoia of
people talk about that.

3690
02:37:30,171 --> 02:37:32,930
The only time I've ever experienced that
is when one of smoked weed.

3691
02:37:33,590 --> 02:37:38,590
But my problem is I don't like going on
stage stone anymore because you're so

3692
02:37:38,691 --> 02:37:41,990
ultra sensitive my ear because like I
already struggle with it enough.

3693
02:37:41,991 --> 02:37:45,350
I'm hearing everything happening and
dissecting it all,

3694
02:37:45,351 --> 02:37:50,210
like hypercritical in real time and you
can't do that and performing let go.

3695
02:37:50,211 --> 02:37:52,910
So you kind of have to like,
it's two different brains.

3696
02:37:53,480 --> 02:37:55,880
Um,
but if I'm up there singing and looking

3697
02:37:55,881 --> 02:37:57,290
at an audience,
if I'm a stone,

3698
02:37:57,300 --> 02:37:59,420
I know enough about myself to know like,
I'll,

3699
02:37:59,421 --> 02:38:03,320
I'll get internalized and just only
start listening to the band and the

3700
02:38:03,321 --> 02:38:03,710
music.

3701
02:38:03,710 --> 02:38:06,020
And you sort of forget that.
Like there's all these people there.

3702
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:09,080
You have to give a show too.
And again,

3703
02:38:09,110 --> 02:38:11,720
maybe that is the show and we get lost
in the music.

3704
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:15,410
And then I've also played some of the
best gigs I've ever played in my life,

3705
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:18,320
uh,
on edibles.

3706
02:38:19,450 --> 02:38:20,130
Cause you,
you know,

3707
02:38:20,130 --> 02:38:25,130
sort of like an anti anxiety and just
like very free and you feel everything

3708
02:38:25,431 --> 02:38:28,700
much more delicately and in terms of
response,

3709
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:31,520
but it's not something I would like.
Oh,

3710
02:38:31,521 --> 02:38:33,350
we got to get high.
It's good trump template gig.

3711
02:38:33,440 --> 02:38:35,480
You do or you don't?
I don't honestly kind,

3712
02:38:36,070 --> 02:38:38,440
but I mean is you do what you do
whatever you want.

3713
02:38:38,441 --> 02:38:39,001
You don't.
Yeah.

3714
02:38:39,001 --> 02:38:40,250
There's no,
if you are,

3715
02:38:40,251 --> 02:38:41,890
it's just this is tonight.
Right.

3716
02:38:41,960 --> 02:38:44,060
You know,
it's not like you have a ritual,

3717
02:38:44,300 --> 02:38:45,170
right?
Yeah.

3718
02:38:45,590 --> 02:38:48,080
I like a drink right before I go onstage
a shot.

3719
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:50,570
So that messes lot.
I'll call messes with my voice.

3720
02:38:50,630 --> 02:38:51,920
I get that.
You gotta stay away from it.

3721
02:38:52,010 --> 02:38:52,770
I just like

3722
02:38:52,770 --> 02:38:54,540
a little,
just that little feeling that you get

3723
02:38:54,541 --> 02:38:55,320
with one shot,
like,

3724
02:38:55,320 --> 02:38:56,340
oh,
here we go.

3725
02:38:56,570 --> 02:38:58,730
I like that.
Well,

3726
02:38:58,731 --> 02:38:59,331
no,
I did.

3727
02:38:59,331 --> 02:39:00,350
Uh,
what about food?

3728
02:39:01,140 --> 02:39:04,190
Oh,
that man,

3729
02:39:04,310 --> 02:39:06,710
it depends.
I don't like eating close to a show,

3730
02:39:06,711 --> 02:39:08,300
especially certain,
it's just not good.

3731
02:39:08,630 --> 02:39:13,460
Not Good.
I'll eat a big lunch and then just fast

3732
02:39:13,461 --> 02:39:16,820
and I'll eat after the gig most times
because I jumped around a lot and get

3733
02:39:16,821 --> 02:39:17,750
into shit.
Yeah,

3734
02:39:17,751 --> 02:39:18,500
me too.
Um,

3735
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:22,940
and then one time we did this like radio
thing or some shit and I was,

3736
02:39:22,941 --> 02:39:24,350
or I couldn't fucking sing.
Anyway.

3737
02:39:24,351 --> 02:39:27,860
My voice was going as this freebie
throwaway thing for serious and we'd

3738
02:39:27,861 --> 02:39:31,790
been in there setting up and rehearsing
in the studio all day and then they

3739
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:32,331
realize like,
oh,

3740
02:39:32,331 --> 02:39:33,740
we haven't eaten.
I'm fucking starving.

3741
02:39:33,741 --> 02:39:36,230
I'm gonna play gigs.
So we had some fid delivered and I ate

3742
02:39:36,231 --> 02:39:38,660
it like 10 minutes before we're supposed
to be correctly.

3743
02:39:38,870 --> 02:39:41,780
Most people don't even know what fun and
uh,

3744
02:39:42,350 --> 02:39:44,090
it just bombed me.
Dude.

3745
02:39:44,110 --> 02:39:46,580
Like your worst nightmare.
You're out there like trying to really

3746
02:39:46,581 --> 02:39:49,490
push and singing on a microphone and not
shit your pants.

3747
02:39:50,180 --> 02:39:51,980
Um,
so I've learned my lesson.

3748
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:52,320
I

3749
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:55,800
hit the wall the other day in my house.
I don't know what the hell I ate,

3750
02:39:55,830 --> 02:40:00,720
but I literally had to put my hand on a
railing so I could squeeze my butt

3751
02:40:00,721 --> 02:40:03,420
cheeks together harder so I couldn't
shit myself.

3752
02:40:03,580 --> 02:40:04,380
Jeez.
It,

3753
02:40:04,380 --> 02:40:08,670
it broke through some weird barrier
where I thought I knew I had to take a

3754
02:40:08,671 --> 02:40:11,150
shit,
but I was thinking maybe I could let a

3755
02:40:11,151 --> 02:40:13,680
far to how first when I'm on my way to
bathroom,

3756
02:40:13,681 --> 02:40:15,960
I don't know what I was thinking.
The gambler,

3757
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:19,590
Bret took a step.
I took a step and all of a sudden it's

3758
02:40:19,591 --> 02:40:22,710
like,
like if I had a water bag inside my body

3759
02:40:22,711 --> 02:40:27,711
and it just broke and then I'm holding
it all together with my asshole and

3760
02:40:27,931 --> 02:40:31,740
squeezing my ass cheeks and the fucking
abdominal pain is like,

3761
02:40:31,830 --> 02:40:34,020
whoa.
The litter,

3762
02:40:34,150 --> 02:40:36,030
it's,
I feel like you remember when you were a

3763
02:40:36,031 --> 02:40:38,760
kid,
used to put your thumb over the garden

3764
02:40:38,761 --> 02:40:43,761
hose and just try to really clamp that
fucking thing down and like you got to a

3765
02:40:44,161 --> 02:40:47,040
place where you stopped all the water
from coming out of the garden hose,

3766
02:40:47,041 --> 02:40:49,650
but barely,
I mean fucking barely.

3767
02:40:49,830 --> 02:40:52,860
That was my ass hall the other day.
And I'm holding onto the railing,

3768
02:40:52,861 --> 02:40:56,970
just wheezing.
And I did these little baby steps like

3769
02:40:56,971 --> 02:41:00,420
this towards a toilet where I was not,
I wasn't even picking up my legs.

3770
02:41:00,660 --> 02:41:03,510
I was just sliding my legs over,
barely,

3771
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:08,730
barely got my pants off and it was like
a broken fire hydrant came out of my

3772
02:41:08,731 --> 02:41:11,940
asshole just uhg.
And I was like,

3773
02:41:11,941 --> 02:41:13,980
where was this?
Where'd this come from?

3774
02:41:13,981 --> 02:41:16,680
Like five minutes ago,
there was nothing wrong with me.

3775
02:41:16,681 --> 02:41:19,800
I felt 100% normal.
I wouldn't have imagined that this could

3776
02:41:19,801 --> 02:41:20,520
happen.
Right.

3777
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:24,770
And then all sudden it's flying at me.
That's terrifying to think could happen

3778
02:41:24,771 --> 02:41:25,950
at anytime.
You can be on a plane.

3779
02:41:26,310 --> 02:41:29,310
Yeah.
Stuck in your seat and you just shit all

3780
02:41:29,311 --> 02:41:33,060
over your socks and your pants and then
just runs up your back and down your

3781
02:41:33,061 --> 02:41:33,900
legs.
It can happen

3782
02:41:33,930 --> 02:41:36,240
in anybody.
Have you ever had full blown,

3783
02:41:37,050 --> 02:41:40,750
absolutely horrible food poisoning and
coming out both ends and you literally

3784
02:41:40,770 --> 02:41:41,760
think I might die.

3785
02:41:41,850 --> 02:41:42,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

3786
02:41:42,721 --> 02:41:44,520
I had a real bad once.
Well,

3787
02:41:44,521 --> 02:41:48,330
I've had it real bad twice,
but that Barracuda than I used to have

3788
02:41:48,331 --> 02:41:51,090
this cool 1970 barracuda.
It was named the sick fish.

3789
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:53,970
The reason why I named it the sick fish
because I got food poisoning.

3790
02:41:54,510 --> 02:41:56,670
I ain't linguine with clams and
Illinois.

3791
02:41:56,880 --> 02:41:59,220
There's no fucking clams anywhere near
Illinois.

3792
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:02,220
And those things got me hard,
man.

3793
02:42:02,460 --> 02:42:05,250
I couldn't even make a fist.
The next day I was walking around like a

3794
02:42:05,251 --> 02:42:06,930
Zombie.
I was dead.

3795
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:10,950
I spent the whole night throwing up and
shitting myself and then the next day I

3796
02:42:10,951 --> 02:42:13,590
was just dead.
I drank like five or six cups of coffee

3797
02:42:13,591 --> 02:42:15,060
cause we had a film,
this thing where we were,

3798
02:42:15,480 --> 02:42:18,360
they were putting the engine in the car
and they were going over the design.

3799
02:42:18,361 --> 02:42:20,760
I was like barely able to stay awake
while I was doing that.

3800
02:42:20,761 --> 02:42:21,780
I was so wrecked.

3801
02:42:23,560 --> 02:42:25,590
It's all I had at one time,
uh,

3802
02:42:25,690 --> 02:42:29,020
from this Chinese buffet and it was a
for or you know,

3803
02:42:29,410 --> 02:42:33,100
it hit me hours later.
It was later that night and all of a

3804
02:42:33,101 --> 02:42:36,610
sudden it was just,
it was in this bathroom for four or five

3805
02:42:36,611 --> 02:42:41,560
hours and it was those things like it
was the worst shape I've ever been in.

3806
02:42:41,620 --> 02:42:43,180
But in the,
in the back of your mind,

3807
02:42:43,210 --> 02:42:44,043
you know,
you're like,

3808
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:45,710
it's okay.
I know,

3809
02:42:45,850 --> 02:42:47,950
I know this is food poisoning,
but like it's good.

3810
02:42:48,010 --> 02:42:49,210
It's okay,
it's going to hit,

3811
02:42:49,240 --> 02:42:52,000
it's going to go to a point and then,
and then it just,

3812
02:42:52,001 --> 02:42:54,430
throughout the night it just kept
getting worse and I kept asking,

3813
02:42:54,431 --> 02:42:57,430
where's this point going to be or do I
need to go to the hospital?

3814
02:42:57,431 --> 02:43:02,431
Because there was very uncommon,
you know like up.like abdominal tremors,

3815
02:43:04,360 --> 02:43:07,660
shit from puking so hard and your
muscles are just spasming and no,

3816
02:43:07,661 --> 02:43:10,300
you can die from it.
I mean people have died from Eco Lye

3817
02:43:10,301 --> 02:43:12,100
poisoning.
There was a

3818
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:14,980
scene in food inc where they talked
about this little kid,

3819
02:43:14,981 --> 02:43:18,240
they got food poisoning from a,
I think it was at Jack in the box and he

3820
02:43:18,290 --> 02:43:20,800
wound up dying was right.
Yeah.

3821
02:43:20,801 --> 02:43:23,320
It's horrible.
It's a terrible way to die and you're

3822
02:43:23,321 --> 02:43:26,470
ingesting some sort of a poison and it
just takes over.

3823
02:43:26,471 --> 02:43:29,620
Your system just kills your cells.
Your body can't process it quickly

3824
02:43:29,621 --> 02:43:30,850
enough,
can't get it out enough.

3825
02:43:31,090 --> 02:43:34,300
You're shitting yourself and throwing up
and doing everything you can to get

3826
02:43:34,301 --> 02:43:36,310
whatever the fuck is inside you out,
right?

3827
02:43:37,460 --> 02:43:38,890
Yeah.
All at food.

3828
02:43:38,891 --> 02:43:40,990
Food on the road,
we play it pretty safe.

3829
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:42,460
Yeah.
I'll skip meals.

3830
02:43:42,461 --> 02:43:46,210
A lot of times I'll not eat if the only
alternative is something like really

3831
02:43:46,211 --> 02:43:47,090
shitty.
Yeah.

3832
02:43:47,210 --> 02:43:49,240
Just because,
not because like,

3833
02:43:49,270 --> 02:43:50,980
oh,
I'm a health nut,

3834
02:43:50,981 --> 02:43:52,870
but it's just not worth it.
You don't know.

3835
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:54,250
I bring a lot of protein bars.

3836
02:43:54,450 --> 02:43:55,880
Okay.
I bring a ton of protein bar,

3837
02:43:55,881 --> 02:43:59,350
so if I'm stuck and I need eat something
I just down like,

3838
02:43:59,360 --> 02:44:01,060
uh,
we have a bunch of on it.

3839
02:44:01,061 --> 02:44:02,290
Protein bars.
I like those.

3840
02:44:02,291 --> 02:44:04,270
I like those quest bars and I mean sugar
in them.

3841
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:07,420
I like a Mussel farm.
I some good bars just,

3842
02:44:07,540 --> 02:44:10,510
I don't live off of them,
but it's way better than that.

3843
02:44:10,540 --> 02:44:12,490
I'm not getting a burger or you eat
sugar?

3844
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:13,960
Very little.
Very little.

3845
02:44:13,961 --> 02:44:15,580
Very little.
I'll give him like last night I had a

3846
02:44:15,581 --> 02:44:16,630
piece of apple,
rhubarb,

3847
02:44:17,200 --> 02:44:19,540
strawberry,
rhubarb pie though with whipped cream.

3848
02:44:19,590 --> 02:44:20,470
Ooh.
I went deep,

3849
02:44:21,430 --> 02:44:24,250
but that's rare.
I did a thing a while back.

3850
02:44:25,080 --> 02:44:27,400
I kind of got pressure,
but I tried to see just how long,

3851
02:44:27,910 --> 02:44:30,820
as long as I could without any sugar and
carbs you go.

3852
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:33,480
I was like 12 days something crazy.
That's,

3853
02:44:33,500 --> 02:44:34,410
it was nice man.

3854
02:44:34,580 --> 02:44:38,050
You,
well this is hard because everything has

3855
02:44:38,380 --> 02:44:40,760
sugar in it and you just,
but and then,

3856
02:44:40,761 --> 02:44:44,020
but after even just abstaining that
short amount of time when I did eat it

3857
02:44:44,021 --> 02:44:46,240
again,
at first it was like everything tasted

3858
02:44:46,241 --> 02:44:50,110
so sweet.
You could really understand how much

3859
02:44:50,111 --> 02:44:52,540
we're getting drugged with food.
Um,

3860
02:44:52,630 --> 02:44:55,090
but my thing is coffee.
I drink coffee in the morning.

3861
02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:57,640
I'm not a breakfast guy voted in but I
just can't drink it straight cause it

3862
02:44:57,641 --> 02:45:00,640
takes like a bucket full asshole.
I got to cut it with something.

3863
02:45:01,140 --> 02:45:03,730
I could cut out coffee with my life.
I could probably cut out sugar.

3864
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:06,510
Oh did you say you cut it with some sort
of sugar cream and sugar and they

3865
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:08,950
usually see I just used cream man or I
drink these.

3866
02:45:08,951 --> 02:45:11,100
Did you like this?
The Caveman's I get a bunch of those in

3867
02:45:11,101 --> 02:45:11,440
bad.

3868
02:45:11,440 --> 02:45:12,760
Yeah,
that we'll have lunch sent to you.

3869
02:45:12,790 --> 02:45:14,950
How do you get the mud but down?
I mean,

3870
02:45:14,951 --> 02:45:16,570
it's just like,
I don't get my bud from this.

3871
02:45:16,670 --> 02:45:18,310
Right.
I don't know what I ate that made me get

3872
02:45:18,311 --> 02:45:18,791
mud,
but,

3873
02:45:18,791 --> 02:45:21,370
but whatever it was,
it turned out to not be anything.

3874
02:45:21,400 --> 02:45:25,150
Like I had that one terrible shit and
then the rest of the day was golden.

3875
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:27,920
It was no problems.
It's like something got in there and

3876
02:45:27,950 --> 02:45:31,870
microbacteria I ate a lot of probiotics.
I don't know if that helps.

3877
02:45:32,230 --> 02:45:35,620
I'm hoping that that helps and that when
I eat something funky,

3878
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:39,160
all the good stuff that I eat.
Like I eat Kimchi almost every day.

3879
02:45:39,490 --> 02:45:43,180
I drink every day,
but I hate as cancer.

3880
02:45:43,780 --> 02:45:48,610
So I don't eat steak very often.
I don't think state cancer.

3881
02:45:48,670 --> 02:45:51,070
I like,
you're like Raul or like really,

3882
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:52,180
you know,
rare,

3883
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:52,991
rare.
Oh look,

3884
02:45:52,991 --> 02:45:53,530
your raw.

3885
02:45:53,530 --> 02:45:55,910
So I just know that the,
the,

3886
02:45:56,200 --> 02:45:58,870
the rare occasion when I have a steak,
I'm going to get the Cias.

3887
02:46:00,820 --> 02:46:01,990
It's just worth it.
But,

3888
02:46:01,991 --> 02:46:04,900
uh,
it makes me eat red meat very little.

3889
02:46:04,901 --> 02:46:06,820
Now what was the last time you had wild
game?

3890
02:46:07,660 --> 02:46:08,470
Oh,
man.

3891
02:46:08,470 --> 02:46:10,610
Like real gail wild.
Um,

3892
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:13,190
probably
when,

3893
02:46:13,210 --> 02:46:14,500
uh,
when I was out in Utah,

3894
02:46:14,501 --> 02:46:17,330
I worked with this kid who was a big
hunter and he would bring in elk,

3895
02:46:17,750 --> 02:46:20,660
like filet medallions that are like
hamburger and he that he,

3896
02:46:20,690 --> 02:46:23,090
he would,
he lived in Wyoming so he could pull

3897
02:46:23,091 --> 02:46:28,040
like two or three extra tags year,
much like the 18 deep freezers full of

3898
02:46:28,041 --> 02:46:31,340
every possible cut of meat you can think
of made from elk meat.

3899
02:46:31,790 --> 02:46:34,580
And he would bring it in sometimes when
we were working and cook that shit in

3900
02:46:34,581 --> 02:46:36,290
the first time I ever tasted it,
I was like,

3901
02:46:36,830 --> 02:46:38,000
I don't ever want eat beef again.

3902
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:41,570
That was the most delicious meat I've
ever tasted in my life.

3903
02:46:41,690 --> 02:46:46,370
I basically eat it almost every day.
Elk almost every day because I,

3904
02:46:46,400 --> 02:46:49,280
we shoot an elk,
I sh I try to shoot an elk a year.

3905
02:46:49,281 --> 02:46:52,460
You don't always get one.
Obviously this year I got lucky.

3906
02:46:52,461 --> 02:46:54,830
I got to,
I scheduled two elkanns.

3907
02:46:55,430 --> 02:46:57,440
Um,
and I figured I was going to strike out

3908
02:46:57,740 --> 02:46:59,990
if not both of them.
Definitely one of them.

3909
02:47:00,200 --> 02:47:02,720
And I just,
I got real lucky on both.

3910
02:47:02,750 --> 02:47:03,583
Yeah.
Wow.

3911
02:47:03,670 --> 02:47:04,460
Again,
it is.

3912
02:47:04,460 --> 02:47:07,010
There's,
there's definitely a having really good

3913
02:47:07,011 --> 02:47:08,750
guides that good guides,
you know,

3914
02:47:08,751 --> 02:47:13,610
cause I had a long be yourself and your
family here one year off a year.

3915
02:47:15,030 --> 02:47:17,070
And I heard a lot of it to my friends.
I give a lot.

3916
02:47:17,090 --> 02:47:19,130
I give Gary Clark some,
some elk,

3917
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:19,910
honey,
honey,

3918
02:47:19,910 --> 02:47:22,100
they took some elk.
Wish you around,

3919
02:47:22,101 --> 02:47:23,420
man.
I'll give you some elk too if you lived

3920
02:47:23,421 --> 02:47:24,254
right here.

3921
02:47:24,260 --> 02:47:24,760
Well,
we're,

3922
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:28,100
we're living now.
I'm probably gonna sit on my back porch

3923
02:47:28,101 --> 02:47:29,600
long enough.
It'll probably be pretty easy.

3924
02:47:29,750 --> 02:47:30,583
Well,
um,

3925
02:47:30,620 --> 02:47:35,180
Kentucky actually has a new elk
population over the last like 40 or 50

3926
02:47:35,181 --> 02:47:36,130
years.
I think they've,

3927
02:47:36,131 --> 02:47:38,000
uh,
reestablish it to the point where it's a

3928
02:47:38,001 --> 02:47:39,950
hunting destination now.
They opened it up.

3929
02:47:39,970 --> 02:47:41,780
Uh,
I think you and I were talking about,

3930
02:47:42,230 --> 02:47:43,070
I think we were,
uh,

3931
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:48,250
it used to be flooded with it back in
the 1800 800 amount and they,

3932
02:47:48,500 --> 02:47:50,380
they repopulate it.
I want to sit in the 90s,

3933
02:47:50,510 --> 02:47:52,790
early two thousands,
and now there's so many that they're

3934
02:47:52,791 --> 02:47:54,140
opening it up again.
Yeah.

3935
02:47:54,170 --> 02:47:56,060
Shout out to the Rocky Mountain Elk
Federation.

3936
02:47:56,840 --> 02:47:58,040
That's what they do.
They,

3937
02:47:58,041 --> 02:48:00,230
uh,
they established a habitat for these

3938
02:48:00,231 --> 02:48:03,080
animals were down in sort of in the
south east corner,

3939
02:48:03,210 --> 02:48:04,670
uh,
around the smokies.

3940
02:48:04,671 --> 02:48:05,180
Man.
It's,

3941
02:48:05,180 --> 02:48:07,220
it's,
it's really weird.

3942
02:48:07,290 --> 02:48:09,470
A little wild Turkey and deer be amazing
there.

3943
02:48:09,530 --> 02:48:12,690
I saw Armadillo in the woods at my
house.

3944
02:48:12,710 --> 02:48:14,300
I was like,
no fucking way.

3945
02:48:14,301 --> 02:48:18,620
Like can't and ensures shit.
Like they've migrated that far over and

3946
02:48:18,650 --> 02:48:19,670
up.
Wow.

3947
02:48:19,730 --> 02:48:23,090
So they're really vomity.
They don't really do much good.

3948
02:48:23,150 --> 02:48:26,480
Do you have any elk near you?
There's gotta be when were in were you

3949
02:48:26,481 --> 02:48:28,070
ever hear it?
I don't hear him.

3950
02:48:28,370 --> 02:48:30,500
How long have you been in this new spot?
A while.

3951
02:48:30,501 --> 02:48:34,730
We really haven't even been in,
I stayed there off and on a couple of

3952
02:48:34,731 --> 02:48:36,410
times when dealing with contractors,
they just,

3953
02:48:36,411 --> 02:48:38,300
they just really got finished and out of
there,

3954
02:48:38,301 --> 02:48:40,010
which is perfect.
I got to go back to work,

3955
02:48:40,011 --> 02:48:41,870
but you won't really know until
September.

3956
02:48:41,900 --> 02:48:43,340
Right?
September.

3957
02:48:43,341 --> 02:48:44,174
You're starting here.
I'm

3958
02:48:45,740 --> 02:48:47,210
so many.
Turkey and deer.

3959
02:48:47,211 --> 02:48:50,030
It's kind of a going to be an issue.
I can walk outside and kick the fucking

3960
02:48:50,031 --> 02:48:50,800
Turkey out of the library.

3961
02:48:50,800 --> 02:48:52,910
He's a crazy man.
They get aggressive with you too?

3962
02:48:53,350 --> 02:48:54,650
Yeah,
I don't mind.

3963
02:48:54,651 --> 02:48:58,010
The only thing I tell you what man,
we've got all the snakes and the spiders

3964
02:48:58,011 --> 02:49:01,070
and all that sugar.
A secretary up in around playing with

3965
02:49:01,071 --> 02:49:04,040
like baby copperheads and the creek.
My Mom spanking the shit of me when she

3966
02:49:04,041 --> 02:49:05,520
called me like,
cause I don't worry about this stuff.

3967
02:49:06,070 --> 02:49:09,510
I tell you it was fucked up.
My wife found she was sweet.

3968
02:49:09,511 --> 02:49:13,410
We get lady bugs that come like in this
time of year they tried to come in and

3969
02:49:13,420 --> 02:49:16,110
the on this,
it's like some porch and she's sweeping

3970
02:49:16,111 --> 02:49:18,390
a pile up and found a scorpion.
Oh,

3971
02:49:18,391 --> 02:49:20,010
I found a bunch of [inaudible].
I was like,

3972
02:49:20,250 --> 02:49:22,620
what the fuck?
They're Scorpion and Tennessee now.

3973
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:26,130
I got to worry about that shit.
So that's pretty crazy.

3974
02:49:26,131 --> 02:49:27,450
Yeah,
I couldn't believe it man.

3975
02:49:27,480 --> 02:49:30,090
I mean I hate spiders,
but that's like a whole other level.

3976
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:31,800
They're supposed to be in the desert,
aren't they?

3977
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:34,140
That's what I thought.
But there are two species of Scorpion,

3978
02:49:34,141 --> 02:49:36,300
native Tennessee.
He's basically like equivalent get stung

3979
02:49:36,301 --> 02:49:38,640
by honeybee,
but they just look so evil.

3980
02:49:38,641 --> 02:49:40,860
Man.
I don't want to walk into the bathroom

3981
02:49:40,861 --> 02:49:43,920
and have to be like checking on her,
my toilet bowl from fucking scorpions.

3982
02:49:44,370 --> 02:49:47,280
I always assume they'll that shit.
When you see a Scorpion,

3983
02:49:47,281 --> 02:49:48,360
I assume it kills you.
Well,

3984
02:49:48,361 --> 02:49:50,730
you know why?
Cause you're remember the original clash

3985
02:49:50,731 --> 02:49:52,140
of the titans?
Oh,

3986
02:49:52,141 --> 02:49:54,480
that's right.
When you're moving the blood dripped out

3987
02:49:54,481 --> 02:49:57,090
of Medusa's head bag and it turned into
a giant scorpions.

3988
02:49:57,091 --> 02:49:57,990
That was just,
I was a kid.

3989
02:49:57,991 --> 02:49:59,730
I saw that.
So it's like there were giant,

3990
02:49:59,790 --> 02:50:04,200
the giant like staying in that guy.
That movie was fucked up actually.

3991
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:05,640
It was pretty fucked up,
but it was good.

3992
02:50:05,641 --> 02:50:06,900
It's terrible when you watch it now.

3993
02:50:07,470 --> 02:50:09,660
That's where I got Harry Housing Music
Movie,

3994
02:50:09,720 --> 02:50:12,930
right?
Where it was like stop animation from

3995
02:50:13,410 --> 02:50:14,940
some soap opera or whatever his name
was.

3996
02:50:14,941 --> 02:50:16,230
I don't know.
That's right.

3997
02:50:16,231 --> 02:50:20,110
Medusa as right.
Cracking Harry Hamlin Hamlin here.

3998
02:50:20,130 --> 02:50:22,200
You fucking Hamlin.
And I know that.

3999
02:50:22,720 --> 02:50:24,440
And the guy that played,
uh,

4000
02:50:24,570 --> 02:50:26,210
Haiti's,
you know,

4001
02:50:26,211 --> 02:50:29,250
like the Red Devil,
God's turn into like a dude.

4002
02:50:29,251 --> 02:50:32,040
I forgot all about that movie.
If you saw that kid,

4003
02:50:32,300 --> 02:50:35,600
it was like the tbs that when I was a
kid that would play that and beastmaster

4004
02:50:35,610 --> 02:50:38,820
back to back like every fucking two
hours piece masters.

4005
02:50:38,821 --> 02:50:39,450
So,
uh,

4006
02:50:39,450 --> 02:50:41,170
but yeah,
the original clash of the titans man

4007
02:50:41,180 --> 02:50:43,740
would dusa did a number on me.
What he got.

4008
02:50:44,520 --> 02:50:46,130
I think that was any of it.
Look how bad it looks.

4009
02:50:46,140 --> 02:50:49,390
I think that might've been the first
time I ever actually saw boobies wasn't

4010
02:50:49,400 --> 02:50:54,400
medicinal signs the blood.
It's the ground pins pop up.

4011
02:50:56,580 --> 02:50:59,790
The robotic owl.
Look how bad the fucking special effects

4012
02:50:59,791 --> 02:51:01,410
were.
But we were like,

4013
02:51:01,411 --> 02:51:02,244
dude,
I'm in.

4014
02:51:02,490 --> 02:51:04,050
That's how they did it.
Yeah.

4015
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:06,480
You had to believe.
Wow.

4016
02:51:06,620 --> 02:51:09,940
Look at that dude.
Sturge well you better get the fuck out

4017
02:51:09,941 --> 02:51:11,010
of here.
You're not going to catch a flight.

4018
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:12,480
Okay.
It's two 20 right now.

4019
02:51:12,530 --> 02:51:13,363
Yeah.
Should do that.

4020
02:51:13,720 --> 02:51:15,600
We've got to get you moving next time
you're in town.

4021
02:51:15,630 --> 02:51:17,940
I got to grill back here.
I got to grill and I got some meat.

4022
02:51:17,941 --> 02:51:19,110
I'm gonna Cook for you.
Thank you.

4023
02:51:19,260 --> 02:51:20,520
We'll have a meal.
Awesome.

4024
02:51:20,880 --> 02:51:24,150
Sit down like men will drink next time
you come to Nashville.

4025
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:26,100
I won't be there and I won't be able to
repay the favor.

4026
02:51:26,340 --> 02:51:27,390
Well,
I'll be back again.

4027
02:51:27,420 --> 02:51:28,710
I'll be back at Janie's.
Okay.

4028
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:30,150
See you soon.
Bye everybody.
