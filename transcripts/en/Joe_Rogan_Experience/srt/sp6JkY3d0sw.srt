1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,780
Oh Shit,
I should've tweeted this.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,170
Well you know what folks,
this is going to come out while I'm 

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,410
tweeting,
tweeting at the same time as the Joe 

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,410
Rogan experience podcast brought to you 
by the fleshlight.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,900
If you go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the link for the fleshlight

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,070
Shit,
I can't do this.

7
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:25,490
I can't type one thing and think,
well I can't type,

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,070
so flashlight.
Is this thing you fuck?

9
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:34,071
It's a big rubber,
a sex toy for guys and there's a whole 

10
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:37,461
bunch of different kinds.
They have different insights that feel 

11
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:40,011
different compared to the girls like 
Jenny Hayes feels a d really believe 

12
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:43,700
Isiah Kira.
Do you really believe that 100 percent 

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,070
because there's other kind of sewers out
there like wine guys who have like a 

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,370
really a good palette,
like a little,

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,290
a good d,
good Dick Palette.

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,550
Like guys,
you can tell the perfect textures,

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,240
the way a guy can tell what the textures
are.

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,530
Completely different.
A good.

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,920
If you got a flashlight.com,
you can actually see what the inside of 

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,390
each girl looks like.
So like there's different groups.

21
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:02,690
There's different things in different 
girls like you know,

22
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:05,610
some girls look like they have huge 
fucking cysts in their policies,

23
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:06,980
but it might feel good against your 
Dick.

24
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:08,900
You don't know.
So about.

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah,
if you go there,

26
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:14,130
there's one goes,
I have like crazy bumps and like bubbles

27
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,470
and waves and jagged good things.
So they,

28
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,490
they've,
they create a bunch of different vagina 

29
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:21,490
environments.
Different.

30
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:21,490
It's like,
yeah,

31
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,850
exactly.
And you get a discount if you go to Joe 

32
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:25,850
Rogan's website,
uh,

33
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,780
it's a Rogan and you get 15 percent off 
the number one sex toys for men.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
The fleshlight dude,
you're an awesome commercial guy.

35
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:34,440
You shouldn't do commercials like 
permanently.

36
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,770
That's all you should do all day long 
because just do commercials.

37
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:44,230
So it ain't to segway.
Artists were also brought to you by 

38
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,380
[inaudible] dot com.
It's o,

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,070
n n I t,
makers of Alpha brain,

40
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,090
the cognitive enhancing supplement that 
I enjoy.

41
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,970
Uh,
and uh,

42
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,980
we also make shroom tech sport,
which is the quarter sepsis mushroom 

43
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,940
supplement for endurance training.
If you're like really into,

44
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,510
if you do something really hard like a 
crossfit class or Jujitsu or something 

45
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:05,510
like that,
that's for you.

46
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,491
If you're,
if you're not into that kind of working 

47
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,651
out,
you're probably not going to notice a 

48
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:13,881
difference.
Brian has no use for this stuff and not 

49
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:14,790
use this product,
but I'm sure it's great.

50
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,970
Do you do use the shroom tech immune 
though?

51
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,890
Uh,
I use the more,

52
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,230
the new mood.
That's what I've been grooving on is the

53
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:26,250
new moon.
I didn't mean when I feel sick and right

54
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:29,610
now I don't feel sick.
I just feel like I need to chill out and

55
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:32,700
that's why I need the new mood because 
that's more of like a,

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,660
you know,
like calm,

57
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:34,880
you down,
had some trip to me,

58
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,890
you know,
you like Turkey dinner and now make 

59
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:39,890
that,
that makes you tired when you're,

60
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:39,890
you're done eating it well.

61
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,150
That kind of get,
that has tryptophan in it and it makes 

62
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,380
you feel relaxed and it also makes you a
little bit happier every day.

63
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:49,410
I think if you take take it every day,
I don't really take it.

64
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,040
I take Alpha brain,
I don't take the other ones.

65
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,220
I changed my workout and the take Alpha 
brand and I take the immune shit.

66
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,540
Anyway.
What all this stuff is there.

67
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,070
Nootropics,
and this

68
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,020
is my advice to you if you don't know 
what we're talking about,

69
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,680
don't buy anything please.
Just Google nootropics.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There is a lot of really interesting 
articles about the subject and it's 

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,700
controversial,
but I've been,

72
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,850
I've been experimenting with them for 
years and I enjoy them and not just the 

73
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,830
ones that we sell have used.
Um,

74
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,680
there was a football player,
I think his name is Roman,

75
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,700
asking pretty sure he has a company 
called neuro one and apparently he had 

76
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,500
dealt with some concussions and stuff so
he created his own formula,

77
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,190
like a neutral but formula to enhance 
the way his mind worked and it was 

78
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:38,140
really interesting and I enjoy that 
stuff.

79
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,130
I have no vested interest in whether you
buy it or don't buy it.

80
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:45,430
I if you feel like you don't want to buy
it or you feel like it's too expensive,

81
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:48,640
I encourage people to steal the 
ingredients,

82
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,910
copy it,
and make your own like by,

83
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,610
by the stuff in bulk and make your own.

84
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,230
Yeah.
And I,

85
00:03:56,231 --> 00:04:01,231
you know,
and the other thing is if you try and 

86
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:01,231
you don't like it,
it's you get 100 percent money back.

87
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:05,460
So we can't make it any easier.
We can't make it any nicer.

88
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:08,620
And what's most important to me is that 
nobody feels ripped off,

89
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,100
that nobody wants to fucking blindly 
buy.

90
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,720
Do you?
Don't go to wikipedia.

91
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:18,721
It's blacked out,
but fucking go to yahoo or bing got in 

92
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:22,471
the other search engines that are not 
supporting the soap are against the Sopa

93
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,760
movement.
Soap movement.

94
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,110
Scary as fuck,
right?

95
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,340
Yeah.
Let's talk about that.

96
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,890
Hamilton Morris is here listening.
Go to [inaudible] dot com.

97
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:32,230
Oh,
N nit enter in the code named Rogan.

98
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,670
Get 10 percent off.
That's a bitches.

99
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:34,420
All right,
here we go.

100
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,980
Amanda's here.
The other one I talked to for a long 

101
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:39,980
time exploring them.

102
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,090
Joe Rogan podcast.

103
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,390
Hamilton Morris comes here with a video 
camera when the podcast in its most 

104
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,100
cluttered state possible.
This room is a wreck.

105
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:59,080
I looked like I should be on hoarders in
this fucking room.

106
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,950
Clean this bitch out is ridiculous.
Too much traveling,

107
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:04,870
man.
Too much traveling.

108
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,040
You know it is Hamilton Morris.
Hello.

109
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,890
What's up buddy?
Thanks for.

110
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,320
Thanks for coming on.
Thanks for having me.

111
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,030
I enjoyed a lot of your stuff that I saw
online,

112
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,290
man.
Especially for those who don't know.

113
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,090
You write for a.
for Vice,

114
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:23,350
right?
For Vice Dot com.

115
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:25,750
That's right.
Vice magazine for Vice magazine.

116
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,670
I think the first thing I ever saw you 
do.

117
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,310
You were tripping somewhere in the 
jungle.

118
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,970
I don't really remember what it was,
but you,

119
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,440
uh,
you had taken some trip to hang out with

120
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:38,020
some indigenous people.
What did they give you?

121
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,040
It was the Mirena Indians and they gave 
me a.

122
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,360
well,
they actually didn't give it to me.

123
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,120
It was sort of a complicated trip to 
find them,

124
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:49,970
but they traditionally use the venom of 
this frog cold fuel,

125
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,990
limited use of by color that produces a 
denim that's written all of these 

126
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,560
different psychoactive peptides and 
specifically contains this

127
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,760
substance called der Morphin.
That's a super potent opioid,

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,210
but they kind of,
yeah,

129
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,820
but it doesn't have any sort of like a 
classical opioid effect,

130
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:12,821
like it's not really a sedative and 
people claim that it gives them 

131
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,760
everlasting energy.
They're able to hunt for days without 

132
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,521
sleep and to go days without eating and 
all sorts of supernatural feats.

133
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,510
You have a great voice.
By the way.

134
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:31,511
Can we just say that you're very 
mysterious voice and it's very 

135
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:34,690
interesting.
You should do cool shit if you know.

136
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,400
Cool Shit.
And you have a voice like that dude.

137
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,310
Amazing plays.
Sorry.

138
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,570
So what is the effect this,
this,

139
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,040
this?
Well,

140
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:48,041
that's what I had been told that they 
would go days without requiring sleep 

141
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:53,021
and I'd be able to hunt all night for 
animals in the jungle with these 

142
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:53,021
Indians,
Jesus.

143
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:57,730
And uh,
so I was expecting more of a stimulant 

144
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:57,730
type effect.

145
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,170
But then there's chemical warfare,
morphine,

146
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,770
there's no real reason you should expect
it to be a stimulant.

147
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:04,670
It's an opioid.
There used to be a theory of autism that

148
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:09,350
was based on them detecting derm orphan 
in the urine of autistic children.

149
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,740
So they thought that there was some kind
of bacterial organism in the intestine 

150
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,950
of these children that was naturally 
producing the Dir morphin.

151
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:24,070
And so they thought autism with this 
kind of opioid mediated pathology,

152
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,400
like,
yeah.

153
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,460
In the same way that you're talking 
about endogenous dmt and how that can 

154
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,090
cause a psychedelic experience without 
ingesting a drug.

155
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:37,091
This was the idea is that there's an 
endogenous intestinal opioid bacteria 

156
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,580
that produces derma orphan,
but it's ever been demonstrated anyway.

157
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,560
So I it,
it's never been demonstrated.

158
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:46,220
So had they come to this conclusion as,
that sounds so fascinating.

159
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,330
It's amazing.
Yeah.

160
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,000
I never heard that theory before.

161
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,050
There's all kinds of psychoactive 
substances that have been detected in 

162
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,250
the urine of people with different sorts
of mental illnesses.

163
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:03,251
You know,
there's five mod dmt detected in the 

164
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:05,501
urine of schizophrenia and Whoa.
Totally makes sense.

165
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,050
Yeah,
totally makes sense.

166
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:11,630
If you think about it,
because we all have bodies,

167
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:14,180
like people's bodies go haywire,
you know,

168
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,280
things,
things go running.

169
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,060
I have egos,
I have spots on my hand where my pigment

170
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:25,061
doesn't grow anymore,
so it's like weird shit happens to 

171
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:27,980
bodies.
We easily could happen to your bodies,

172
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,130
your brain's ability to produce 
psychedelic chemicals.

173
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,880
Could you imagine if every day was just 
tripping all day long?

174
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,550
Like you couldn't get out of tripping 
Steph,

175
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:42,551
licking frogs.
You're licking this guy and paying him 

176
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:45,101
$20 just to get off.
I don't know what you're doing with your

177
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:49,420
body was producing a drug like a frog.
Oh,

178
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,670
and the that way.
You know,

179
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,040
I don't think it's that way.
Brian.

180
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,070
His body's now

181
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,070
producing a drug.
He's ingesting his body's producing a 

182
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,070
drug internally.
You silly boy,

183
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,050
I,
but what if they secreted it?

184
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,750
Who the fuck you're secreting the guy?
No,

185
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,270
no.
If you were producing the drug inside 

186
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,981
your body,
if you're urinating secretion frog,

187
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,760
how do they get it from?
They do they actually get five Mao from 

188
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:18,760
frogs?
Can they do that?

189
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,320
Absolutely.
Yeah.

190
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:19,770
Yeah,
right.

191
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,930
That's really some toads.
Right,

192
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,340
and how do you do that?
Um,

193
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:31,341
there's different techniques for doing a
nice to know a guy that raised goofball 

194
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:34,250
various and she lives in Boston and his 
glands that I just squirted out pretty 

195
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:40,941
much collected at least for two on the 
neck and on the legs and he would grab 

196
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:45,450
it by the scruff of its neck and then 
take a cat and show it.

197
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:50,190
The cat is terrified of cats and then 
that causes it to secrete the venom.

198
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:54,930
And then he would pinch all of the 
glands onto a glass sheet and dry it.

199
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,990
That's fucking.
Tell you the secrets.

200
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,540
Cat Joe in life,
everything seems cat.

201
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,470
We've been talking about feral cats.
These cats making drugs.

202
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,030
Yeah.
That's incredible.

203
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,370
Yeah.
So you just scrape it up and smoke it?

204
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,370
Yeah,
but it's not just buy them Yo dmt.

205
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,380
There's also apparently some quantity of
Bufo Tinian and also a bunch of other 

206
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:21,321
things.
That's why it's not really safe to eat 

207
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:21,321
it.

208
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,790
The things people were risked to get 
high.

209
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,310
No,
it's actually worth checking out.

210
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,150
Really actually used to shop where I,
I'd heard that before in the podcast.

211
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,160
I was doing a lot of research and buying
them in mass quantities when I lived in 

212
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Ohio I think.
Yeah,

213
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,170
yeah.
I mean maybe invest in a few frogs and 

214
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,360
cultivate a relationship with them.
I mean,

215
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,210
is it illegal?
It may be illegal.

216
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,910
Five immuno DMT was recently scheduled.
So yeah,

217
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,960
it uh,
it used to be you could get in five mel 

218
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,640
dmt like on the Internet,
right?

219
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:54,390
Absolutely.
Yeah.

220
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,970
That's incredible.
They just didn't know.

221
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Um,
I don't think it really poses that much 

222
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,341
of a risk in terms of a doubt.
There's very many dmt hospitalizations 

223
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,120
compared to even things like lsd.
It's just such a rare thing and it lasts

224
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:10,380
for such a short period of time.

225
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,700
You can just make it like a frog kissing
booth to get around the law,

226
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,630
you know,
just say like,

227
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:18,900
don't say like this is to lick and error
to get the drug off of weight.

228
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,820
You know,
if you want this drug and you encase it,

229
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,660
bring you to a doctor,
I'm going to bring it to.

230
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,710
You're going to bring you to a doctor 
and he's gonna.

231
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,740
He's gonna.
Find out what the fuck is wrong with 

232
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:33,740
you.
You went too deep in the rabbit hole.

233
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,820
You know what?
When a guest like Hamilton Morris is 

234
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,660
here,
I could see where you,

235
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:41,340
uh,
you get a little carried away.

236
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,170
He just wanted to.
You wanted to,

237
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,480
you wanted to perform on his level,
right?

238
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,020
No,
I,

239
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,640
I just want to go where he is.
Stoner is playing around too much.

240
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,260
You already,
you're not even a professional stoner.

241
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,220
You're like a professional,

242
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,750
a psychoactive expert.
You're like one of those dudes.

243
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,710
So you can say,
hey man,

244
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:02,800
what is it about that lotus flower?
And you can go,

245
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:05,080
oh,
well the ludas flower and you'll explain

246
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:10,081
it perfectly.
How do you know so much about all this 

247
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:10,081
stuff?

248
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:10,810
Well,
I've studied it in school for years.

249
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:13,410
I started out studying neuroscience and 
a.

250
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,010
where'd you go to school at the 
University of Chicago.

251
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,280
So this was something that was just 
always pulling at you,

252
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,300
like how the mind works and various 
chemicals.

253
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,410
Um,
yeah,

254
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,620
yeah.
Not necessarily with the drug 

255
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,571
connection,
but I was always interested in science 

256
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:32,370
and neuroscience and then once you 
understand that area,

257
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:37,390
then it becomes even more interesting.
And then also medicinal chemistry,

258
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,540
pharmacology.
It's all interrelated.

259
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,560
And now how did you start putting 
together these videos online?

260
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,370
Um,
well I left Chicago and moved to New 

261
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,930
York and a friend of a friend worked at 
vice magazine and told the editor that I

262
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:56,931
had been.
I was interested both academically and 

263
00:12:56,931 --> 00:12:58,740
in terms of writing about all of these 
psychedelic drugs and they want us to do

264
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:02,670
more informed drug related content for 
the magazine.

265
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,700
So I'm.
So they asked me to start writing a 

266
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:12,771
monthly column,
but vice used to have a totally 

267
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:13,430
different attitude towards drugs in 
terms of uh,

268
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,480
you know,
they'd give someone like an ounce of 

269
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,330
mushrooms and put them in a hotel room 
and just record everything.

270
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:26,331
They did what was happening.
They weren't really interested in the 

271
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:26,331
science of it,
not that that's a bad thing.

272
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,240
So they used to have that attitude,

273
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,900
used to have that attitude and now 
they're more open minded to discussing 

274
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,190
the scientific aspects.

275
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,780
So do you think the scientific aspects 
for the longest time where it was it 

276
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,861
like,
I think it was like maybe a hunter s 

277
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:44,791
Thompson that maybe fucked a lot of 
people up because his thing was just 

278
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:49,480
sort of tag on,
blast off and enjoy the ride of it,

279
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,920
you know,
and that you were kind of a fool to try 

280
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:54,920
to quantify it and package it all 
together.

281
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,200
Do you think that that kind of like set 
that kind of mindset?

282
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:04,201
Sometimes that means that it's a fun 
mindset when you talk about like eating 

283
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:05,260
some mushrooms,
going to a football game.

284
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,590
I mean some people who like looked down 
upon that,

285
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,040
but there's other people that you know,
that I actually enjoy doing something 

286
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,190
like that.
It's not the spiritual thing.

287
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,020
It's not the full blown psychedelic 
connection that you can make.

288
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,340
Yeah,
I certainly do.

289
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,240
It's fun to write

290
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,430
down on that.
No,

291
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:28,460
I think any way that anyone chooses to 
do it is perfectly fine as long as they 

292
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,131
benefit from it and don't hurt.
Doesn't like stab people in the process 

293
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:32,910
or kill a dog or something.

294
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,290
If it was legal,
it would be great because then you would

295
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:41,291
know like what everything was.
That would be the best way to deal with 

296
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:45,971
it.
You the the idea that you just buying 

297
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:49,661
stuff from people you don't know.
It's so hard to cultivate a friendship.

298
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,320
You know where you're trusting someone 
to sell you something they're not 

299
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,320
supposed to be selling you

300
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,120
again.
You get into a tricky situation.

301
00:14:58,121 --> 00:15:00,100
They don't both parties to the time.
Yeah.

302
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:05,130
Especially with something like lsd where
who knows where it actually comes from 

303
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,621
with something like mushrooms and maybe 
you're one degree of separation away 

304
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:09,180
from the source.
It's producing the material and.

305
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:12,820
But with Lsd it could be 20 degrees of 
separation.

306
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,070
You don't even know what it is.

307
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,590
You got to be bold as fuck to eat 
mushrooms in the wild

308
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:22,020
because.
Because just to be sure it is.

309
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,880
I mean there's a few.
Are there few psychedelic mushrooms?

310
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:28,340
It looked like really similar to things 
that are like super poisonous.

311
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,970
Definitely Gallery Ryan and margin Ada,
a bunch of the gala rhina mushrooms look

312
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,770
a lot like the slow subbies and 
massively poisonous.

313
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,400
Do you imagine how many people have died
from that?

314
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,230
I don't know.
That's terrifying,

315
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:46,230
right?
Come on camera.

316
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,200
You're in this room.
Good.

317
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,210
You can just observe.
It's just too weird.

318
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,060
Have a seat,
man.

319
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,800
Have a seat.
Sit Down with us.

320
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,020
We got to include your camera guy.
Otherwise it doesn't feel organic or 

321
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,990
feels stared at.
This is Matt.

322
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:05,991
Everybody mad at the camera guy.
He's here as well because I'm Hamilton 

323
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:11,331
is doing something on isolation tanks 
and we're going to check out the float 

324
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:16,701
lab tomorrow in Venice where a crash.
My friend Craig a crash is a mad genius 

325
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,680
putting together the baddest float tanks
in the world.

326
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,670
We're going to go check out his stuff 
and his crazy cellular influence device.

327
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,700
When did you first learn about the 
flotation tanks?

328
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,680
Is this something that you knew for 
awhile or did?

329
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,670
Yeah,
I mean,

330
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:34,980
I mean,
what?

331
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,890
What?
What gave you the idea to,

332
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,850
to,
to make do this project?

333
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,080
I've always found them interesting.
I think they're pretty fascinating for 

334
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,660
anyone that's studied the history of 
psychedelic drugs,

335
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:50,661
just because John Lilly use them in such
interesting ways and also at the very 

336
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:55,311
beginning of psychedelic research,
there were always these attempts to try 

337
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:58,491
and isolate the experience from the 
environment in some way when they were 

338
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:02,061
trying to quantify or qualify the 
different effects of new drugs in the 

339
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:06,470
sixties and because it's a class,
it's so much based on the environment 

340
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,660
they wanted to try and figure out a way 
to remove subjects from the environment 

341
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,020
and test them in some kind of an 
unbiased setting.

342
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:18,290
And the two ways they had were sensory 
deprivation tanks in these Ganzfeld 

343
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:18,660
devices.

344
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,530
No,
no.

345
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,660
So,
um,

346
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,800
you sit,
you were talking about it earlier.

347
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:29,801
You've,
you've only had one century and it was 

348
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:33,841
quite awhile ago.
It sucks that it's not more readily 

349
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:34,020
available,
you know,

350
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,460
I think,
uh,

351
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,480
if you could just get into it for a 
little bit,

352
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,280
you know,
if you get into like a regular thing,

353
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:42,010
like even just once a week,
that's great man.

354
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,390
If you could find a place that has it

355
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,650
and it's like a massage.
I bet like I just recently got my first 

356
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,190
massage and I always kind of went,
you shunted off just because it seemed

357
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,280
weird to me and I got my first one.
Now I get it,

358
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,440
you know,
it was just nice relaxation,

359
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,210
you know,
it's not that expensive.

360
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,040
It's really good for you too.
I think it's really good to have someone

361
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,160
that be affectionate to,
even if it's just,

362
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,630
you know,
even if it's just,

363
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:05,400
you know,
someone rubbing you with their fingers,

364
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,110
like that's really,
really intimate.

365
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:12,170
You know,
we're pretending that it's not sexual 

366
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,920
because it's not touching your growing.
But when some big fat,

367
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:18,921
sweaty woman who really knows how to 
rubberneck when she's getting in there 

368
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:23,031
with lotion and everything,
the ladies fucking giving you affection,

369
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:28,101
they're giving you affection.
The rubbing your legs when someone's 

370
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:28,101
rubbing your feet.
Yeah.

371
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:32,150
They might as well be blowing you when 
they're getting their heel into the 

372
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,640
little children,
little children,

373
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:35,850
to leave the genitals out of the picture
because that's the person who's doing.

374
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,880
They're being affectionate to you.
You're paying them to be ultimately 

375
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,230
affection to you because yeah,
it works the muscles.

376
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:44,590
And yet increases,
you know,

377
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,610
a blood flow and yeah,
it breaks up scar tissue.

378
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,850
It's great therapeutically,
but it's also great because it's 

379
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:52,850
affection.
What if they finished it off with like,

380
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,820
like rocking you in a chair where they 
held you for like 20 minutes at the end 

381
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,520
and they were just like playing with 
their hair at the very end,

382
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,340
like a baby or something.
That's how that would work.

383
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,850
This is like that extra $10 they'll do 
that.

384
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,420
They said to do the whole thing.
I remember there was a place I used to 

385
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:13,800
go to and they,
uh,

386
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,280
they arrested one of the dudes there 
because he was a,

387
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,550
he was given dudes massages and blow 
jobs.

388
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,090
He was like blowing a lot of the gang 
guys.

389
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,520
And so they caught him the win.
I'm like,

390
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:31,521
look,
he's just trying to make his customers 

391
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:31,521
happy.
You know?

392
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:32,370
What is customer one?
Exactly.

393
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,190
I mean that is what the guy wanted.
He wanted to do it too.

394
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,610
Who got hurt there?
They should have that for everything.

395
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:40,470
Well,
as long as it's really clear that that's

396
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,290
what you want,
right?

397
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,380
Because if you're like a straight guy 
and all of a sudden he's blowing you and

398
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:44,070
you're like,
dude,

399
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,570
wrong signal.
Yeah,

400
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,970
but if you're a gay guy,
fuck.

401
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,530
Really?
We try to stop that.

402
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,520
Why we try to stop that.
Hamilton Morris in 2012.

403
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,190
Why math?
The camera man.

404
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,860
Matt the camera man.
You can talk,

405
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:01,260
brother.
You're allowed to talk.

406
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,620
So it's crazy seeing the internet all 
blacked out today.

407
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,510
Like say Google and Reddit and a tedious
Hamilton.

408
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,540
Yeah,
I noticed it.

409
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,610
What did you think about the soap?

410
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,490
A thing?
I haven't read enough about it.

411
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:19,550
I mean,
I think it's horrifying if it is what I 

412
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,071
think it is,
but I'd like to do a little more 

413
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:24,950
research.
You can even read about wikipedia was 

414
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,380
blacked out.
It represents a trend.

415
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,620
It represents an attempt in whatever it 
is it's trying to control or having the 

416
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:34,830
ability to control the Internet,
but reality is they can do that.

417
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:37,320
Now,
if the government wanted to step in,

418
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:41,400
like if you had some crazy al Qaeda kind
of website up,

419
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,200
they can shut you down and trust me,
it's not gonna do anything but create an

420
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,930
underground tunnel.
We're all going to use and it's going to

421
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,900
be really.
You're just,

422
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,100
you're,
you can't lose.

423
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,160
You're going to lose against the 
Internet if you tried to do this anyway.

424
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:59,161
If you tried to start banning websites,
if you tried to like start monitoring 

425
00:20:59,161 --> 00:20:59,161
people,
they're.

426
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:03,970
The Internet will find a hack for it.
Just like they do every single iphone 

427
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,100
that day before it's released.
You know,

428
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,530
maybe,
maybe,

429
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:06,910
I don't know.
Who is they?

430
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:07,790
You know,
who's been,

431
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,800
who's ultimately going to be in control 
of it and what you know is it,

432
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:12,670
is it really?
Is that what's going on?

433
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:17,671
I don't think there's a vague.
I think what's what's happening is 

434
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:19,930
people were realizing as more people get
more access to information,

435
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,910
that they're not buying the bullshit 
anymore and the only way to stop that is

436
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,580
you're going to have to limit their 
access to information.

437
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:28,810
You're going to have to be able to 
control them.

438
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:30,970
You're going to have to be able to 
somehow another box them up.

439
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:36,230
You gonna have to be able somehow to.
The trend is giving information freely 

440
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,591
through these fucking cell phones and 
wireless Internet connections and 

441
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,580
they're coordinating meetings and then 
people are setting things up and they 

442
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,580
can't stop it.

443
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,520
They can't control it and that's driving
them crazy,

444
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,290
but they can also work through the 
system.

445
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:52,291
Like when you think about how many 
wikipedia entries are written by the 

446
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:52,480
pharmaceutical companies that are the.
You know,

447
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:55,590
how much wikipedia material is actually 
advertising in one way.

448
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,470
Really.
I mean,

449
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:57,850
of course,
if anyone can edit it,

450
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,580
who wouldn't take advantage of the 
incredible resource?

451
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,570
Yeah,
I would imagine.

452
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,250
Yeah.
I mean it's not all good.

453
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:05,350
It's not.
It's not perfect,

454
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:10,770
but it's the best way.
The best way is let the Internet sorted 

455
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,131
out.
The best way is not the government 

456
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:14,131
controls the Internet.
That's the worst way.

457
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:18,300
That's the worst way possible.
A bunch of people are willing to go to 

458
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,490
war.
They get to control the Internet.

459
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:20,170
Fuck you.
No,

460
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:21,670
you don't.
That's crazy.

461
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,940
You fucking resource hogs.
You can control the Internet to Jesus 

462
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:32,370
Christ.
You know you'd steel in minerals in 

463
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,470
Africa and stealing oil in the Middle 
East and trying to jack the Internet.

464
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,230
It's the same motherfuckers got.
Damn it Brian.

465
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,920
I blacked out my website today.
Did you really?

466
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,970
Yeah.
I don't know how to do it.

467
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,380
Yeah,
it didn't really poorly and quick.

468
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,760
I just changed the logo.
Made all the texts gray,

469
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:51,810
dark gray.
Do you feel like you're a part of the 

470
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,660
movement now?
I feel a little left out.

471
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,700
I feel left out.
Well,

472
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,800
NBC would probably be pissed off at you 
if he did that.

473
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,930
Probably if I blacked out my shit.
Yeah,

474
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:02,350
because I mean the people that are 
asking Sofa is all the big media giants.

475
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:06,300
You know all that Darlin's that want to.
Google's not back.

476
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,790
Wikipedia is not entertainment studios 
like Disney.

477
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,720
NBC.
Well,

478
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:18,721
yeah.
I guess they will be the ones who could 

479
00:23:18,721 --> 00:23:18,820
benefit from a crackdown.
You've got to think about how much money

480
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,240
has been lost.
Now there's my question.

481
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:27,660
A lot of people have gotten things that 
they didn't deserve because they kind of

482
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,940
download them illegally maybe,
but how much money was lost was really 

483
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:40,351
any money lost of wonder.
I wonder if like I wonder if it didn't 

484
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:42,580
exist with those people have gone out 
and bought it.

485
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:47,581
Is that what you're saying?
Or would you say maybe they just 

486
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:47,581
downloaded it

487
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:48,920
on a whim and maybe if they like it they
might tell somebody else,

488
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,990
maybe somebody else.
My buyer.

489
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:53,330
Like it's possible that it's not causing
any loss,

490
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,450
you know?
I mean,

491
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,960
I don't know.
It's definitely a lot seminar.

492
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,000
If you look at go to a movie theater 
nowadays.

493
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:01,820
It's not like it used to be.
People are downloading shit.

494
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:03,170
You think that's what's going on for 
real?

495
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,570
Hey,
I,

496
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,150
I hate to admit it.
I used to do it.

497
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:10,151
I used to know I downloaded every single
movie allegedly that came out that 

498
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:11,530
weekend.
Allegedly.

499
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,700
I mean I might be a character,
an idiot.

500
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,850
I'm scared to like a typical guy on the 
Internet,

501
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:20,990
you know?
Okay.

502
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:21,380
Yeah.

503
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,490
I don't think it's.
I don't now I don't do that shit.

504
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,940
I don't think it's that,
I think if,

505
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:32,170
if the movie theaters are empty,
it's because of the economy a and 

506
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,060
because of the movie is suck.
A lot of movies suck.

507
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,640
It's hard to find good movies and that's
the problem.

508
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:42,641
Like it's,
it's weird going to the movies nowadays 

509
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:42,950
and taking a girl on a date and spending
$80,

510
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:43,520
you know,
it's like,

511
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:48,521
wait a second,
what happened to like $6 movie tickets 

512
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,640
instead of $20 movie to cause inflation 
bitch.

513
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,950
But that's what I know.
But that's one of the reasons.

514
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:56,951
There's a movie theater that's in 
Pasadena by the ice house w that we 

515
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:57,230
walked by and yet the movies were like 
one or two weeks old.

516
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,800
They weren't first week,
maybe they weren't old yet and they were

517
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:01,940
like,
I think $3 tickets.

518
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,340
That place is cool.
What's the name of that place?

519
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,560
I can't remember.
It's off of Colorado.

520
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,570
I love when you find a place like that.
Yeah,

521
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:13,100
it does something cool like that place,
like just slightly old movies.

522
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,810
Really cheap.
Super cheap.

523
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,130
That's how.
Yeah,

524
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,630
I can wait.
I'll wait.

525
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,600
I'll support your cool business and it's
kind of a retro movie theater.

526
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,400
It's not new at all,
like it's old school,

527
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:25,310
what you remember in the eighties when 
[inaudible] came out and you're like,

528
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,340
Ooh,
coolest movie experience Evermann we 

529
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,420
were playing at the Houston livestock 
and uh,

530
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,860
who is that stupid movie that they made 
about,

531
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:37,560
uh,
some kids in the woods and it was like a

532
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,430
witch Blair way.
Blair witch project,

533
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,660
right?
Isn't that it?

534
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,750
That it was like a fake documentary 
style,

535
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,960
which we wanted me and Chris Mcguire 
watch that.

536
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:52,961
These guys came down to the show and 
then afterwards one of them worked at a 

537
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:56,951
movie theater and he said,
you guys want to go see the Blair witch 

538
00:25:56,951 --> 00:25:56,951
project?

539
00:25:56,951 --> 00:25:57,080
Like right now just to us.
I was like,

540
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,780
Oh shit.
So it was me and him,

541
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,860
my buddy Chris and a couple of his 
friends and we just alone in the 

542
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,570
theater.
He turned the thing on,

543
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:09,200
like he literally had the keys and we 
watched the Blair witch project alone.

544
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,240
Wow.
That was fucking awesome.

545
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:16,300
So the only way to watch that thing was 
it was the perfect way to watch that 

546
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,780
movie and I tried to watch it again and 
it was fucking terrible.

547
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,280
Second thought,
it was terrible.

548
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,300
I tried to like,
I dunno,

549
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,440
recreate the moment.
Did you hear that Mcdonald's has to now 

550
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,240
put up signs saying that their French 
fries cause cancer that there.

551
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,600
Yeah,
it's in,

552
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,540
it's something that's in French fries,
potato chips,

553
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:36,260
coffee cigarettes at the chemical was 
produced through the browning process.

554
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:41,290
You know,
like when they put the fries in the 

555
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:41,750
Fryer,
it causes cancer.

556
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,040
Like that Browning Browning of what the,
I guess

557
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,640
the oils that are in it or whatever.
And uh,

558
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,250
so they have to put up signs and I guess
there's ways around it,

559
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,760
like they don't have to use do it the 
browning process or they could do it the

560
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,120
baking process.
But that of course would take long.

561
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:59,940
The thing with fries,
it probably makes it super clear.

562
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,160
It's interesting,
there's the browning process and it kind

563
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:07,161
of makes sense because you know,
they say that if you eat meat and you 

564
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:07,161
eat it like,
like,

565
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:08,120
well done.
Like the carbon,

566
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,500
the outside,
it's like really not good.

567
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,610
It's like the,
the,

568
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,700
the,
the black shit that people love the 

569
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,310
crispy outside.
It's like really bad for you.

570
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,660
Yeah,
that's the worst part,

571
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,780
right?
I think it is a fucking weird people,

572
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:23,490
men.
But they're so delicious.

573
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,130
That's the most taste,
best tasting cancer ever.

574
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:27,570
What did you say that's the best tasting
cancer.

575
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,380
Oh,
by the way,

576
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,980
a lot of people got mad at us because of
this last podcast.

577
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:35,280
I had a fucking bunch of annoyed people 
with me on twitter.

578
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,320
Why?
Oh,

579
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,570
I don't know man.
There was a couple of people that are 

580
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:41,970
annoyed that we're vegans and one guy 
might have overreacted to because I just

581
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:45,170
get tired of people in their Hashtag.
I'm Vegan,

582
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,220
like they say something and then go 
vegan.

583
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,640
And he was a saint because we were 
talking about um,

584
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,360
uh,
animals getting killed in processing 

585
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,360
plants.
It does happen,

586
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,270
you know,
groundhogs,

587
00:27:57,271 --> 00:28:02,160
all kinds of animals die know it's not 
when you buy plants from a store.

588
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:07,161
I mean,
unless you're a grow your own organic 

589
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:09,441
setup and you're doing it all yourself,
chances are in the harvesting of the 

590
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:09,441
plants,
some animals are going to die,

591
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:11,900
unfortunately even more.
What's that?

592
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,220
Maybe even,
I don't know if it's different.

593
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,360
It's like mice,
these,

594
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,460
these,
uh,

595
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:22,550
you know,
the area is going to be devastated 

596
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,450
unless you have some like,
really good setup or it's like,

597
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,430
you know,
great composting.

598
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:32,431
I mean,
unless you're doing it all yourself for 

599
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:32,431
your own food,
if you're doing it all yourself for your

600
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:32,730
own food,
that's one thing.

601
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:35,310
But if you're buying some shit from 
whole foods or from wherever it's coming

602
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:37,800
from a farm somewhere,
even if it's organically grown,

603
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,390
you don't think some animals are getting
jacked.

604
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,660
Oh yeah.
There was an article about doe in 

605
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,840
Australia at least it's a,
a greater total loss of life,

606
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:50,841
but it's a different type of life if 
you're a vegetarian than if you're an 

607
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:50,841
omnivore because,
uh,

608
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:56,030
because of all the mice that are killed 
in the process of harvesting Greens.

609
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,370
But I dunno,
it doesn't totally make sense.

610
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,860
But again,
I don't,

611
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,850
I don't think this is where they're not 
ridiculous.

612
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,330
They're sensitive people and I can 
understand that.

613
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,740
Excuse me,
I can understand that,

614
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:11,670
appreciate it.
But it's,

615
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:12,990
um,
it's just,

616
00:29:12,991 --> 00:29:17,991
it gets annoying that I'm Vegan.
It's like it's this self self righteous 

617
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:21,840
air to it and there's a weird thing that
it's okay to live,

618
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,230
to eat some living things.
It's okay to kill trees.

619
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,790
It's okay to kill plants.
It's okay to kill fruit and vegetables.

620
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,610
Okay.
To kill that.

621
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,880
You can kill it.
You could chop that fucking let us read 

622
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,550
out of the ground and it's debt and then
you eat it.

623
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,580
That's okay.
But it's not okay to kill an animal 

624
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:40,580
like,
well,

625
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,140
when do you,
when do you draw a line?

626
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,930
Is there any distinction that would.
If the animal was just meet,

627
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,410
it was just meet with a heartbeat and he
couldn't think and it just sat there.

628
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,700
If it didn't,
if you didn't need it,

629
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:49,480
somebody else would.

630
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:54,870
Is that okay?
At what point is it okay to eat an 

631
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:58,681
animal and other life form?
Is it only stuff that can't move 

632
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,760
already?
So we're sensitive people.

633
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,950
What you should be asking for the like 
even responding to that because who 

634
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,300
cares what other people eat and what 
their views on.

635
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,710
You know,
I think there's certain cruelty 

636
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,620
associated with factory farming and I,
I agree with this gross.

637
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,420
It's horrific.
You know,

638
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,140
I try to avoid.
I try to avoid cheeseburgers except in 

639
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:21,550
and out,
in and out.

640
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,490
It's pretty fucking spectacular.
Five guys burgers.

641
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:28,240
I hope those cows were treated well.
If I had known they were treated well,

642
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:33,270
I feel much better about it.
But the reality of you by Kentucky Fried

643
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,040
Chicken,
are you by any sort of meat product,

644
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:41,041
from any fast food,
anything you're buying something that 

645
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:44,101
did not live a happy life,
you know it's going to be the cheapest 

646
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:44,101
meat they can possibly get you.

647
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,240
Right?
I mean,

648
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,810
isn't it right?
Africans fiberglass,

649
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,920
right?
Like,

650
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,620
look at Taco Bell's meat.
I don't want,

651
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,510
you know,
I don't think vegans are silly.

652
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,480
I just don't agree with it.
I don't agree with it.

653
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:03,481
And I don't think we should be.
I don't think we should be treating 

654
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:08,701
animals the way we treat people.
I think we should be kind to everything 

655
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,780
we can be kind to.
I definitely think factory farming.

656
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:13,450
It's fucked,
but I think regular farming,

657
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:15,330
it's pretty goddamn natural.
I mean,

658
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,810
it's what people have been doing 
forever.

659
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,890
Yeah.
As long as you're not abusing the 

660
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:21,890
animals,
it's,

661
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,570
it's what people have been doing for 
forever and those animals.

662
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:25,900
I mean,
who's to say that you're not supposed to

663
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:27,700
take out cows?
That's silly to me.

664
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,280
Someone's going to take them out.
Is it a Jaguar?

665
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,070
The Jaguar is and take them out.
Can people take the cow out?

666
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,550
We can't.
You're talking about extremeness though,

667
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,560
unlike most people don't believe that 
even even most like normal anti cruelty 

668
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:44,100
animal companies or whatever they're 
called charities,

669
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,020
uh,
even them,

670
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,270
they still believe in,
you know,

671
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,440
humane killing of animals.
But the,

672
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,750
the,
what you're talking about is people that

673
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:52,920
are just like nothing.
No,

674
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,790
you can't.
Well,

675
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:55,020
there's definitely grades,
right?

676
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:55,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

677
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,000
And that's only a small amount of the 
people at Joe's,

678
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,030
like you're talking about like the three
twitter,

679
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,160
twitter followers or whatever is.
But it's,

680
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:07,161
you know,
it's a significant chunk of the 

681
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:07,161
population.
I think there's a lot of people that are

682
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:10,311
like really upset at any idea of any 
cruel to whatsoever the animals and you 

683
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:10,860
know what man is because they love their
animals.

684
00:32:10,861 --> 00:32:15,861
I totally get that.
I did love their animals and I totally 

685
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:17,760
get loving wildlife,
but you know,

686
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:21,030
the idea that they're going to live 
forever if you don't eat them.

687
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,380
Like,
what the fuck's happening here?

688
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,090
No,
don't eat animals ever.

689
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,040
Okay?
Who's going to eat them?

690
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,790
Then block them.
The fuck's gonna happen.

691
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,060
You're gonna,
you're gonna.

692
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:34,070
Go around and gelding them.
You gotta to make sure that these elk 

693
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,360
don't fuck because otherwise they're 
going to be everywhere you ever go to.

694
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,650
There's a town in Colorado called 
Evergreen,

695
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,020
beautiful,
beautiful place.

696
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,600
It's amazing.
It's up in the mountains and it's,

697
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:45,910
um,
you,

698
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,760
you,
uh,

699
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:48,950
there's a certain part of town where you
can't go anywhere,

700
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,320
uh,
at a,

701
00:32:50,321 --> 00:32:55,321
uh,
during certain migrations because the 

702
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:56,210
elks,
we'll just walk down the main street.

703
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,560
It's fucking amazing.
There's like a hundred elk.

704
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,740
There's a photo of them and there's like
a herd of them and they're walking down 

705
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,080
the middle of the street.
It's like,

706
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,040
wow,
what a crazy place where you live,

707
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,770
man.
A herd of elk,

708
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:13,470
just Walkman.

709
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,440
You know?
If,

710
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,050
if it wasn't for people shooting,
those elk herd would be 200.

711
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:20,330
The next year it'd be 300.
There's not enough predators.

712
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,730
Like unless you want more mountain 
lions,

713
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,640
unless you want to start bringing in 
mountain lions in your daily equation,

714
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,450
you've got to do something to get rid of
those elk.

715
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:29,300
Look,
they have to shoot those fucking things.

716
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:34,950
We want to live there.
You're going to have to shoot a deer or 

717
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,991
fucking terrifying.
If you've ever been in a place where 

718
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:39,770
deer are like super plentiful and you 
can't drive safe now Ohio,

719
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,980
it's ridiculous.
There's deer flying all over the place 

720
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:44,980
and there's.
You wake up.

721
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,940
Normally I would wake up at my,
at my dad's house when I lived at my 

722
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:48,940
dad's house and see a deer,
like,

723
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,660
like every week I would see a couple in 
my backyard.

724
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,550
Yeah,
and if you're driving home at night,

725
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:55,610
that's the main streets are right next 
to my dad's neighborhood.

726
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,060
So I mean obviously that's dangerous.
Yeah.

727
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:01,520
Somebody is going to eat them.
You got to eat more of those.

728
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,110
Yeah.
I've never actually had deer.

729
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,200
I've never had any of that craziness.
You've never now I sending you're 

730
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,870
vegetarian or anything?
Oh yeah.

731
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,860
How long have you been a vegetarian?
Since 2009.

732
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,990
But occasionally.
Is it a um,

733
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,560
health choice or is it a,
um,

734
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,620
I think it's just generally encourages 
me to be more conscious of what I'm 

735
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,470
eating because otherwise I'm more 
inclined to eat,

736
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,320
just gross fast food and things like 
that.

737
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:33,970
And I think my diet,
it's improved enormously since I became 

738
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:33,970
a vegetarian.
Yeah.

739
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,910
The more plant matter you can get in,
it seems like you just feel better,

740
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,950
feel healthier.
But goddamn need is delicious.

741
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:45,590
I eat what ash occasionally do.
No red meat or anything along those 

742
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,360
lines.
I have my theory that the,

743
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:48,740
uh,
said it before,

744
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,680
that the stuff that's the quickest is 
the best for you.

745
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,250
Like deer,
deer is really good for you because 

746
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,351
they're hard to get those motherfuckers 
they run because they got like really 

747
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:01,570
good meat cows.
It's pretty good mate.

748
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,660
What's tastes like?
I don't know because it has to be the 

749
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:06,660
best.

750
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,500
Get a Cheetah Burger.
Oh Damn.

751
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:10,460
People will be like,
no,

752
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:12,230
don't eat a cat.
Yeah.

753
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,120
Isn't that funny?
I bet you,

754
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:19,150
but nobody wants you to eat a cat.
You can't go hunting tigers and eat the 

755
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,450
tiger.
Tiger meat was fucking delicious.

756
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:25,630
People will like you dick.
But meanwhile that tiger would hunt you 

757
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,550
dummy.
I'm not saying tiger should be extinct.

758
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,320
I'm saying if I lived in India I would 
think tiger should be extinct.

759
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,990
Not necessarily,
but definitely if I lived in the.

760
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,160
I say they've canceled alone.
What about big ones?

761
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:41,830
Man?
Man.

762
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,560
Leave him alone.
Fucked up bro.

763
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,160
You ever see a real one?
You just have like a cat thing that you 

764
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,440
would have to do at tiger about to 
attack.

765
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:54,441
You just throw.
It was like a piece of paper the other 

766
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:54,441
direction and run,
you know,

767
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:54,441
or something like that.
That will work.

768
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,320
It probably does.
There's probably like,

769
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,560
like in,
in their instinct that they will do 

770
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:01,560
that.
Yeah.

771
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:01,800
I wonder if there's like any people that
has ever tried that.

772
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:06,910
Dude,
I can't even believe you're asking that 

773
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:06,910
question.
It might be DNA stuff.

774
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,460
It might be.
You got to high before the show,

775
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,350
just a red ball when clients come in and
see what happened at Hamilton Morris.

776
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:15,330
This is a ridiculous show I brought you 
onto.

777
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,020
I apologize.
But then again,

778
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:21,070
I don't.
It's fun.

779
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,910
I'm just kidding.
Um,

780
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,620
so you,
you've been doing this a vice.com

781
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:31,730
thing for how long now?
Since about 2000.

782
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,910
Seven.
Two thousand eight.

783
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,200
Is that full time your thing?
No,

784
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,280
I worked for other magazines as well,
like writing stuff,

785
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,520
writing for Harper's as well.
But vice is the main.

786
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,180
What was it like when you sat down with 
that a shogun character?

787
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,020
What is that guy's name?

788
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,670
Alexander Shogun.
Yeah.

789
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:58,200
And he's like some crazy super chemist.
He's really brilliant.

790
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,730
He's,
yeah.

791
00:36:58,731 --> 00:37:02,880
That was an amazing interview and that 
was really different,

792
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:04,380
you know,
people kept writing me saying,

793
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:05,220
Oh,
you're so lucky.

794
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:10,221
You're so lucky.
But it was incredibly difficult to get 

795
00:37:10,221 --> 00:37:11,370
that interview with them and it took.
So it wasn't like a luck thing.

796
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:12,180
Like I just like,
hey,

797
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:13,920
we found a Kooky guy for you to 
interview.

798
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,390
Go visit him.
I had to,

799
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,640
had actually been to his house a couple 
times beforehand and I had to be vetted 

800
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,970
by his family and all of these things 
because a lot of people don't understand

801
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:27,930
what he does and uh,
and he's harassed by people.

802
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:32,931
There's this ridiculous idea that 
inventors are somehow responsible for 

803
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:36,570
what is done with their creations.
So people think that if somebody dies of

804
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:37,740
an MDM,
a overdose,

805
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:41,460
that he is somehow responsible for it,
which is of course totally ridiculous.

806
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,100
Wow.
But you know that mentality.

807
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:49,130
Yeah.
There is that mentality which is pretty 

808
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,561
silly.
The legalization of any of this stuff 

809
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,441
would require people to go over dosages 
and be scientific about it.

810
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:55,010
And if,
if,

811
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,410
if any of this stuff was legal,
it was legal.

812
00:37:58,411 --> 00:38:01,140
If you could just be prescribed for 
being prescribed,

813
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:02,670
if you could have a doctor that would 
say,

814
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:03,630
you know,
you're pretty sane.

815
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:07,200
I think you could handle ecstasy.
So he prescribes you a little ecstasy.

816
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,780
Go have a party this weekend.
You know,

817
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:15,410
I don't know about that.
But I think using it as an adjunct to 

818
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,290
psychotherapy is not that far away.
Well,

819
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:21,310
you think so you really think they're 
gonna accept that there are certainly 

820
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:21,630
trying to.
The organization maps,

821
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,410
that's pretty much what they do.
Yeah,

822
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:28,430
I'd read that.
They've made great strides with people 

823
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:28,430
as well with posttraumatic stress 
disorder,

824
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:33,410
which is not surprising.
I mean I think a lot of this stuff that 

825
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:33,410
maps does,
it's just proving these things that most

826
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:37,431
people understand intuitively,
but it has to be demonstrated in a 

827
00:38:37,431 --> 00:38:39,840
rigorous scientific fashion before and 
the regulatory authorities will accept.

828
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:45,190
That would really help a lot.
No doubt about it.

829
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,670
They would restructure society if,
if people would allow.

830
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:53,080
We're allowed free use of psychedelics.
Everyone looks at it as such a frivolous

831
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,000
issue,
like so silly,

832
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,660
you know,
like why,

833
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:57,550
why,
why and concentrate on such things.

834
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,410
What a tiny do.
Trying to get high.

835
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,680
You know,
if you talk to most people about 

836
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,001
psychedelics,
you feel like you're stuck in the 19 

837
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:07,741
fifties movie.
What are you trying to do with your 

838
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:07,741
life,
kid?

839
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:07,741
What do you want to do?
Mess with those mushrooms.

840
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:10,090
Put that stuff down,
get yourself square,

841
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,230
get on the straight and narrow,
but the mushrooms down boy,

842
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,410
isn't it?
I mean,

843
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:18,490
doesn't that seem like that?
It's a.

844
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:21,610
it's not a subject that's easy to be 
approached.

845
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:26,611
Seriously with adults.
There's not a lot of them that will 

846
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:27,310
engage you in it.
In the regular world.

847
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:32,550
You want to talk seriously about 
psychedelics and seriously about 

848
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,930
positive effects of them and mushrooms 
and know who wants to talk

849
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,200
to you about that stuff.
Yeah,

850
00:39:36,201 --> 00:39:39,320
I mean now most of it has to be shrouded
in scientific research.

851
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,670
What if you were working for an 
insurance

852
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,250
and you were like one of their top sales
guys,

853
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,130
but you're running around the office 
telling everybody that got to do acid.

854
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,500
You know,

855
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,990
I guess I don't even really know what 
public perceptions.

856
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I mean I have an idea,
but it's so hard for me to go into like 

857
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,701
to really understand what it would be 
like in middle America or something if 

858
00:40:01,701 --> 00:40:01,830
you worked at an insurance office.
Well,

859
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:04,980
I think it's different now everywhere 
because of the Internet.

860
00:40:04,981 --> 00:40:09,981
I don't think there is necessarily a 
middle America that's the same middle 

861
00:40:09,981 --> 00:40:10,210
America there,
there,

862
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:14,400
there were some innocent parts of the 
country or countries where things were a

863
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:15,900
little quieter or slower.

864
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,390
But I think because the access to 
information that people have today,

865
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:23,010
I don't.
Kids can learn a lot of shit online.

866
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:28,320
Even if their environments socks,
they can develop and be engulfed and 

867
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,160
whole communities online and they can 
evolve so much quicker.

868
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:37,550
So this is like groups of people that 
evolved like in small towns now that 

869
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,361
would have,
they wouldn't have existed to three 

870
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:41,361
decades before.
You know,

871
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:47,210
I think that's,
that's one of the big differences 

872
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:51,351
between now and you know,
I try to think about what it must have 

873
00:40:51,351 --> 00:40:53,460
been like to be my parents to grow up.
You know,

874
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,150
the Internet doesn't come along until 
you like

875
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:58,450
way too old,
barely getting into it.

876
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:03,690
You just go on CNN.com
and check things and whether the big 

877
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,411
thing.
I remember going to the library all the 

878
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:07,411
fucking time.
Like that was like the cool thing to do.

879
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:09,040
Random movie.
Go get a book.

880
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,710
Libraries must be fucking hurting right 
now.

881
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,960
They're not doing as well as they've 
been doing before and why libraries are 

882
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,300
doing great.
I think so really?

883
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:27,590
I would just think that it's easier to 
get information without going to the 

884
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:27,590
library and now my mom doesn't even go 
to a library morning.

885
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:30,040
She would go like multiple times.
Most people have access to a computer.

886
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:35,270
Then there's all these subscription 
services that are too expensive for 

887
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:35,270
people

888
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,980
that are individuals to use.
So it's like if you want to use factiva 

889
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,270
or scifinder or lexus nexus or any of 
these databases,

890
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:46,330
scientific databases,
you have to go to a library or awakened 

891
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:46,330
me.
Right,

892
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:46,330
right.
Of course.

893
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,210
So if they're always going to exist in 
some form,

894
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,440
it would be too expensive.

895
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:52,980
There's reading books is a different 
experience than reading a kindle.

896
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,860
I don't know why I'm mad.
I don't know why.

897
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,900
Oh yeah.
It's kind of better.

898
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,500
I don't know why though.
I don't know why I like turning pages,

899
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,910
you know?
I don't know why.

900
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:05,040
I feel like I've actually thought it 
with me.

901
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,590
I think it's softer.
I think once the technology gets up,

902
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:12,591
which is already here,
but went to get the technology because 

903
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:15,240
we can kind of feel like a cottony feel 
or I use a kindle,

904
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,740
I use a kindle,
right?

905
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,690
I mean I do have one of those things,
but if I had to choose between that,

906
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:22,890
like if I had the book and it was on the
kindle,

907
00:42:22,891 --> 00:42:27,891
I would take the book with me.
Do you smell your books before you read 

908
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:27,891
them?
No.

909
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:29,680
You'd never seen,
never smell your book before.

910
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,660
Do you ever smell your book?
I have no books before.

911
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:38,360
I like that little muskie.
I shouldn't say I've never smelled like 

912
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,590
smell when I'm reading.
We have.

913
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:46,010
It's cool until kindle has that ability 
to like holding your hand in it.

914
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,930
It's its own thing.
Like that book was great and it smells a

915
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:53,931
little weird until it has that kind of 
real feeling to it because right now 

916
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:54,090
it's just like you're looking at a piece
of glass,

917
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,710
like a words on,
on a screen.

918
00:42:55,711 --> 00:42:57,420
It's,
it's you disconnect from that.

919
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,740
The last used book that I bought was a,
the sacred mushroom and the cross is the

920
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:06,741
only way to buy it.
You was used until young Ervin just 

921
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:07,930
rereleased it and data.
Did you.

922
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:09,520
You've read that right?
I

923
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,800
familiar with it.
I've read part of it and read it cover 

924
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,871
to cover and I've read part of the 
second book as well was at the end of 

925
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:18,680
the road or something like that.

926
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:23,890
It was a sacred mushroom in the cross 
and then there was the other one was 

927
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:23,890
goddammit.
Turn back time.

928
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:28,110
Something in the Sea Scrolls and the 
Christian myth.

929
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,020
Something along road.

930
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

931
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:32,120
I do home care before a sacred mushroom 
and the cross.

932
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:33,140
Is it just A.
Yeah,

933
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,520
it's Bible scholar.

934
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,410
Yeah,
that's a,

935
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,030
that's the idea.
And then he,

936
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:40,670
uh,
he was the only one who believed that it

937
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:45,320
was all about mushrooms that the entire,
the Christian religion,

938
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:48,320
like a big part of it was about 
fertility.

939
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:50,180
Rituals and mushrooms.

940
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,320
Yeah.
But even that you,

941
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,740
I don't know if you're familiar with the
book,

942
00:43:52,741 --> 00:43:56,750
shroom by Andy Lead her or letting her 
know.

943
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:57,230
What's that?
Oh,

944
00:43:57,231 --> 00:43:58,560
it's good.
You should definitely check it out.

945
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:02,130
It's really a pretty impressive piece of
research,

946
00:44:02,131 --> 00:44:07,131
but he in the book and then he goes 
through all of these different mushroom 

947
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:10,341
myths,
but he talks about a sacred mushroom in 

948
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:10,580
the cross and claims it allegro never 
even believed that,

949
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:15,610
that that he was just so.
He hated Christianity so much at that 

950
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:19,311
point in his career that he just was 
looking for some way to disprove it or 

951
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:21,690
dismiss it or make it look ridiculous in
the public eye.

952
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,830
Whoa.
That's awesome.

953
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:26,020
If that's true.
Holy Shit.

954
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,800
Damn for it.
Part of me doesn't want it to be true 

955
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,800
because it's such a great story.
I really.

956
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,340
You could say,
look dude,

957
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:36,150
the Bible was about Dude's tripping on 
mushrooms and I really wish it could say

958
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:38,790
that and that's what Rick Strassman is 
trying to do now with,

959
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,820
at least with the Old Testament in dmt.
We're really.

960
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:45,600
What is he saying in psalms speak 
relatively recently,

961
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:48,240
and he said that he has a new career 
goal,

962
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:53,241
is to go through all of the old 
testament looking for instances of 

963
00:44:53,241 --> 00:44:56,870
altered states of consciousness that 
might be indicative of some kind of a 

964
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,530
dmt type experience.
Well,

965
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,950
yeah.
Yeah.

966
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,510
There were some recently.
There was some guy.

967
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,780
I'm a scholar from Jerusalem that was 
proposing that about Moses and he was a.

968
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:17,130
The Moses,
his encounter with the burning Bush 

969
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,450
might've been some reference to the 
Acacia Bush,

970
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,300
which is very high dmt content.
Absolutely.

971
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:21,680
Yeah.
No,

972
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:23,400
that's how he saw God.
Yeah.

973
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,970
I've already got a legit scholar.
I forget the gentleman's name,

974
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,300
but he was a legit scholar who is 
bringing up this connection to possibly 

975
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,510
know psychedelic experiences.
And then I've also heard a theory that 

976
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,860
the ark of the covenant was a Meth Lab.

977
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:44,670
That's awesome.
That's a fucking great quote.

978
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,440
That's a kind of quote you here and you 
go,

979
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:47,790
damn,
I wish I wrote that.

980
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:53,470
Your architect covenants a meth lab.
Do you ever hear those people that 

981
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,411
believe the Ark,
the Ark of the covenant actually exists 

982
00:45:57,411 --> 00:45:57,411
and it's in,
um,

983
00:45:57,411 --> 00:45:58,470
what part of Africa is it?
I don't know.

984
00:45:58,471 --> 00:46:00,660
I only know about it through Indiana 
Jones.

985
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,190
I've seen the photo.
That template.

986
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,570
Is it?
Ethiopia,

987
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,030
Ethiopia.
Good.

988
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,950
Graham Hancock was one of the guys who,
uh,

989
00:46:08,951 --> 00:46:12,140
that's what got him interested in,
uh,

990
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,160
these,
uh,

991
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,300
alternative views of history.
Zeros,

992
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:20,301
I believe it was Ethiopia.
And they have this area that's guarded 

993
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:21,050
and these,
these,

994
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,900
these monks,
it's guard that they have like a 20 year

995
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,110
lifespan.
So powerful.

996
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,500
It's so sexy.
It's really.

997
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,570
Shit was true.
Uh,

998
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,720
you know,
I really,

999
00:46:33,721 --> 00:46:38,721
I don't know if it's true,
but I don't want to anybody to disprove 

1000
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:38,721
it.

1001
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:39,990
I think it's been investigated.
I think the discovery channel or someone

1002
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:41,130
did a special.
I really haven't.

1003
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:46,131
I wanted to do it thing.
What Hancock had said was that no one 

1004
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:47,520
was ever allowed to get anywhere,
even close.

1005
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,170
Maybe it's politics.
That's what he said.

1006
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:51,900
But here's the map of it on Indiana 
Jones to,

1007
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,730
during one of the cutaway scenes where 
it's just like that,

1008
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:55,800
that plane,
a dotted line,

1009
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,980
just find it through there.
I don't think it works that way.

1010
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:02,520
Could you just completely interrupted my
train of thought?

1011
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,980
I don't know where I'm going now.
You know.

1012
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,050
Let me,
have you ever heard of [inaudible] Lane?

1013
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:12,140
What is he?
And it's that America's oldest brewery 

1014
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,460
and it's in Pennsylvania and it's used 
to be this beer that living in Ohio.

1015
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:19,200
People I know would go to and stock up 
with truck folds just so they could have

1016
00:47:19,201 --> 00:47:20,680
it for like a year.
Why?

1017
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,870
Uh,
because it's,

1018
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:22,830
you know,
it's really good.

1019
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,500
It really is.
It's older than Budweiser.

1020
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,380
Budweiser came out,
supposedly stole their Eagle Logo.

1021
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,560
Is this a new sponsor?

1022
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:35,490
Worked in doors.
You can't even buy it here in 

1023
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:37,111
California.
So they stole the Eagle and Budweiser 

1024
00:47:37,111 --> 00:47:37,720
stole the Eagle and used it in their 
logo.

1025
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,210
And now you decided to come to Ohio.
Uh,

1026
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:44,030
the first week sold out the entire,
like,

1027
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,530
like ipod style,
like they had to build a whole new thing

1028
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:52,531
on their factory just for Ohio now 
because I had an everywhere you went 

1029
00:47:52,531 --> 00:47:54,070
beyond that,
that's all everyone served.

1030
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,280
Everyone else was drinking that.
It was like the craziest thing seeing in

1031
00:47:57,281 --> 00:48:02,281
Ohio when he went back home,
everybody was drinking this beer and 

1032
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:02,410
it's fucking pretty good for just like a
Shitty,

1033
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,420
cheap light beer.
But everybody was drinking.

1034
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:08,140
That's how bad Ohio sucks.
They get excited about some shit.

1035
00:48:08,141 --> 00:48:13,141
Beer Budweiser's heard get so fired up 
and they band together to support some 

1036
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,680
shit.
Beer Budweiser's hurting from it.

1037
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:15,330
How bad is that?

1038
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:16,600
Beer?
It's a really good.

1039
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,760
Come on.
I wish I could give you so many.

1040
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,400
You could probably get in Chicago.
No,

1041
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,970
you probably can't get.
I like Sam Adams.

1042
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:23,160
Is it like that?
Uh,

1043
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:23,770
they,
yeah,

1044
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:25,600
they have different kinds.
They have like lights,

1045
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:26,560
they have lawyers.
They have.

1046
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:28,630
I mean it's,
it's really good to work for them.

1047
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,940
Place the oldest brewery.
It has to be the best.

1048
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,660
They're going to fucking like the first 
one.

1049
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,750
I don't know what's going on here.
I think he's.

1050
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:37,190
I think he's broken into an impromptu 
commercial note.

1051
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,130
You'd like it trial if you ever get the 
chance.

1052
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:44,240
Alright.
Pennsylvania for finals is a impromptu 

1053
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,020
commercials.
Not only do I swear to God,

1054
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:47,870
Dude.
Get the fuck out of here.

1055
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,550
Don't play anything from.
Okay.

1056
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:53,870
I believe it.
How dare you never heard of it.

1057
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,920
I know either did I don't give a fuck.
Beard.

1058
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,280
That's crazy though.
But the budweiser story was really 

1059
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:02,500
interesting.
I thought like how they took the logo or

1060
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:02,700
the mascot.

1061
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:03,400
Eagle.
Dude.

1062
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:05,470
Everybody wants an American Eagle.
What about goodyear tires?

1063
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,480
Will they have an American Eagle too?
It was not an American Eagle in there 

1064
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,100
somewhere.
What about the same as.

1065
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,570
Wow.
It's pretty close.

1066
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:17,110
It's crazy.
I mean,

1067
00:49:17,111 --> 00:49:19,690
there's a slight difference.
Budweiser is the led Zeppelin a beer.

1068
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:22,810
So that's what you're trying to say.
Maybe they stole it from Budweiser,

1069
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,530
you know.
No,

1070
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,150
no.
They've had it longest subtle who?

1071
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,400
There wasn't even a company when it came
out.

1072
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,680
Settle down.
Son Hamilton.

1073
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,590
Morris.
I apologize for everything.

1074
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,290
Everything you've experienced so far 
today.

1075
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,030
And this,
uh,

1076
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:38,350
strange ride.

1077
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:41,800
Um,
so,

1078
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:42,880
um,
do you want to do this,

1079
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,370
um,
thing about isolation tanks?

1080
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,300
What's your,
uh,

1081
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,890
your goal when you try and get out of 
this?

1082
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:53,980
I'd like to use one of the tanks myself.
I want to try specifically those tanks 

1083
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,740
that you were talking about earlier that
have some kind of an auditory and visual

1084
00:49:56,741 --> 00:49:57,970
component.
Yeah.

1085
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,560
He's got that all set up,
man.

1086
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,040
He's got it set up where he's got videos
of it.

1087
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:06,550
Were they using the sound and they're 
playing like music and you could see the

1088
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:11,110
waves in the water because the speakers 
were actually like floating in the water

1089
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:13,210
and they're,
they're like set up right by your head.

1090
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,600
And the waves are like making the water 
splash and jump and wiggle.

1091
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:20,500
It's pretty fucking tripping,
man.

1092
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:21,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

1093
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:25,240
It's pretty trippy thing that's going to
be also affecting your body while you're

1094
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:25,720
in there.

1095
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:29,090
You know,
you're going to feel sound on your skin.

1096
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,460
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.

1097
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:32,780
You will get it.
Yeah.

1098
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:35,210
You're going to hear it in your,
in your ears and you're going to feel it

1099
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:40,211
on your skin because it's like moving.
That's moving through the all the water 

1100
00:50:40,211 --> 00:50:43,901
though.
The whole thing is rippling while 

1101
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:43,901
they're doing this.
It's really pretty one.

1102
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:45,830
Wait until you hear it because your ears
are under the water.

1103
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,130
Here's the under the water and it's not 
distorted by the water.

1104
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,090
I don't know.
Could be on big notes as possible.

1105
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,150
Things like really splash around.
Well,

1106
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,050
what does that feel like?
That's to feel nutty.

1107
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,490
I'm curious.
Yeah.

1108
00:50:58,491 --> 00:51:00,470
His idea,
Scott crashes,

1109
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:04,520
idea is that he's going to develop,
um,

1110
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:09,580
like how to tutorials for sports and for
all sorts of different things.

1111
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:12,380
Music,
language.

1112
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:17,381
They'll be able to teach people language
is much quicker and that in the sensory 

1113
00:51:17,381 --> 00:51:18,920
deprivation environment with the lack of
external stimuli,

1114
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:20,240
your brain will be more focused.

1115
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,140
So it sounds like it does sound like the
lawnmower man.

1116
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:26,240
You're right.
It does.

1117
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,380
Does he do these nootropic injections 
beforehand or something like that?

1118
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:31,640
That's what he should do,
right?

1119
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,280
We've got to give them some fucking 
nuclear shit.

1120
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,110
It's like an x men type situation.
Yeah.

1121
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:39,970
The,
um,

1122
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,190
the idea behind it is fascinating.
You know,

1123
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:47,230
the idea that you can program the mind 
better inside the sensory deprivation 

1124
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:51,881
state.
It really makes a lot of sense and it 

1125
00:51:51,881 --> 00:51:52,550
seems like it would work that way if you
really get someone really knew what they

1126
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:56,480
were doing to design some cool programs,
you know,

1127
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:59,060
we think that would be like the best way
to learn ever.

1128
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:00,740
Especially if you learned something 
cool,

1129
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,290
but it'll be a would be distracting your
concentration and the campaign.

1130
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,160
That's what I would think if you got 
comfortable with it.

1131
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:10,490
See the thing about the tank is once you
do it for a long time,

1132
00:52:10,491 --> 00:52:13,160
you know you do it a couple times,
like four or five times.

1133
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:14,630
Once you,
once you do it,

1134
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:19,660
he know what it is.
You can just settle right in and once 

1135
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,030
you settle right in,
then stock it distracting at all.

1136
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:22,670
It's going to be wild as fuck floating 
there,

1137
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:27,850
watching some just image appear right in
front of you because you can't really 

1138
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:31,790
see that the light is so dim that all 
that comes through is the actual image.

1139
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:35,630
You can't see the outline of the box.
Have you ever been to one of those group

1140
00:52:35,631 --> 00:52:40,631
massages where there's a shitload of 
people in one room and then they're 

1141
00:52:40,631 --> 00:52:40,631
playing like,
like a movie that's on loop,

1142
00:52:40,631 --> 00:52:42,730
like on the wall of like a house,
you know,

1143
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,810
in Asia somewhere like a bird's flying.
See,

1144
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:50,000
I find that annoying and distracting.
If it was pitch dark,

1145
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:55,180
I think I would be better for sure.
And I think that's how like when you're 

1146
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,330
relaxing and one of these isolation 
takes any kind of,

1147
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,350
you know,
sound or anything like that,

1148
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:00,500
that seems like it'd be distracting.

1149
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,630
You're absolutely right.
It would be.

1150
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,780
And I have never gotten into the video 
or audio thing that's scarred crashes 

1151
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:14,231
thing.
I like to go in and just chill on my 

1152
00:53:14,231 --> 00:53:14,231
own.
But I think it's fascinating.

1153
00:53:14,231 --> 00:53:16,700
I mean I'm not opposed to trying it.
It sounds really nuts.

1154
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:21,350
And if he could ever figure out how to 
really hook it up and do it right,

1155
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:23,360
I mean what a great way to like learn a 
language or something.

1156
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:24,740
And what a great way to like,
you know,

1157
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:29,770
could you imagine if you took,
like if you found out that you could 

1158
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:31,290
develop a course specifically for use 
inside the isolation tank,

1159
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:36,291
like the optimum way to learn things and
memorize things and put them to use and 

1160
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:38,850
you show that you could make people 
learn Spanish 10 times quicker,

1161
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:42,990
something fucking nutty like that.
So you wolves on loop at night,

1162
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:47,760
like walking slowly just to go against 
your fears and stuff like that.

1163
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:55,230
Yeah,
if you could really get it to the point 

1164
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,850
where it becomes a Hologram,
that would be the ultimate entertainment

1165
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:57,660
experience.
Dude.

1166
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:02,810
You're living in a hologram.
You get in the isolation tank and they 

1167
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:03,530
put whatever Hologram you want on.
Yeah.

1168
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,280
Okay.
Let's do the Amazon jungle.

1169
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:08,250
Boom.
That would be wild.

1170
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,820
Wouldn't be wild.
And you get to watch like a movie.

1171
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,010
Get to watch a life take place in front 
of you,

1172
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:17,180
sister,
act to someone to about you.

1173
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,780
Don't even paying attention.
That's what reality is going to be.

1174
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:24,180
Eventually it's going to be,
you know,

1175
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,310
opera.
You know you're going to have options to

1176
00:54:27,311 --> 00:54:29,250
be able to choose where you want to do 
today.

1177
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:35,540
Give me an eventually.
It's got to get to a point where we can 

1178
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:35,540
construct reality.
I mean,

1179
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,840
I know that they've,
they've devised artificial realities for

1180
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:38,640
video games.
They looked pretty fucking spiffy.

1181
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,470
You know,
when you're watching a good video game,

1182
00:54:40,471 --> 00:54:42,950
like,
like what is it like metal of honor,

1183
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,820
one of those games that were there,
that's the name of it.

1184
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,270
It's one of them called call of duty in 
comedy.

1185
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:53,330
You watch those,
those video games like that's the 

1186
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:53,330
graphics are fucking absolutely 
incredible out.

1187
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:56,640
How long is it before they can project 
that into your head?

1188
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:02,210
How long is it before?
Instead of looking at that amazing 

1189
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:05,991
thing,
someone figures out how to projected 

1190
00:55:05,991 --> 00:55:06,840
into your head that's going to happen 
and when that happens,

1191
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:11,870
that's going to be an alternate reality.
They're going to be able to program it 

1192
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:12,510
alternate reality,
and if you,

1193
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:17,570
if your consciousness,
if they can figure out a way to lock 

1194
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:18,690
your consciousness onto that alternate 
reality,

1195
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:21,390
it's almost like putting you in another 
world.

1196
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,700
It's almost like putting you in another 
dimension.

1197
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,220
Yeah.
Is that possible?

1198
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:27,080
I think it is.
Yeah.

1199
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,150
That seems like what's gonna Happen,
right?

1200
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:31,980
Primitive forms of it are already 
possible and things like that.

1201
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:37,060
Those implants for blind people that 
allow them to see what the camera and 

1202
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:37,060
the go.
Oh yeah,

1203
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,570
I've heard about that.
Into their brain.

1204
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:43,730
Jesus,
you can input visual stimuli instead 

1205
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:45,020
still probably far away to everyone can 
do it like xbox seven,

1206
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,850
$7,200.
Right.

1207
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:51,860
It's like how we look at like the old 
cowboy style photographer dude who had 

1208
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,440
to throw that thing over his head,
remember and he had the big torch on his

1209
00:55:55,441 --> 00:55:57,810
hand and it would go off.
Do you remember that?

1210
00:55:57,811 --> 00:56:02,811
Like when like all the wild west movies,
the guy would like have to get under a 

1211
00:56:02,811 --> 00:56:04,590
tarp and shit to take a picture.
Do you remember all that?

1212
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,640
And think about what that was.
There was like,

1213
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,810
there was no fucking movies like shut 
up.

1214
00:56:09,811 --> 00:56:12,870
They could barely get an image.
Everybody at a stand still,

1215
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,580
you know,
you had to like really wait,

1216
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:16,140
like how long did it take to take that 
picture?

1217
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:17,730
Yeah,
took a little time,

1218
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:18,240
right?
Yeah.

1219
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,030
You couldn't just move around and wasn't
like instant.

1220
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:24,510
Think about that was only 200 years ago.
Right.

1221
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,580
That's amazing.
That's fucking incredible.

1222
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,610
That is 200 years ago and now we're 
complaining.

1223
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,920
I wonder if all the shenanigans that 
happen,

1224
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:37,950
like having to sit there with your 
family and then like one of the kids 

1225
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:40,531
would fart and you know,
there was probably all these little 

1226
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:41,920
things that always happened during those
photos.

1227
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:46,950
You know,
still there was probably some humor 

1228
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,111
that,
that was lost and that we went after to 

1229
00:56:49,111 --> 00:56:51,480
that anymore to hold their face.
Right.

1230
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:53,710
I liked a lot of blurry pictures from 
the.

1231
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:55,210
Oh yeah.
Usually the kids.

1232
00:56:55,211 --> 00:57:00,211
That's why the kids are always the 
malaria post photos is that his people 

1233
00:57:00,941 --> 00:57:03,760
would walk in and out of the frame and 
you made nothing.

1234
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:06,910
Drives me crazier than fucking ghost TV 
shows.

1235
00:57:06,911 --> 00:57:10,330
When I watched those ghosts TV shows and
I just go,

1236
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:12,880
you're not gonna find anything while you
fucking with me.

1237
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,200
Never find anything,
there's never been a bigger cock tease.

1238
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:22,230
Then the ghost reality genre and they're
on like season three or something like 

1239
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,230
this.

1240
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,230
Like,
look,

1241
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,160
can you see this?
ECTOPLASMIC enters the room.

1242
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:26,670
It's like a speck on the screen.
It was like this.

1243
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,780
This is where the ectoplasm enters the 
room.

1244
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,090
This is where the.
What the fuck did you say?

1245
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:36,250
Like you asshole,
you know they have a fucking ghost ghost

1246
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:37,870
hunting.
You're not fighting shit.

1247
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,240
Shut up.
Every fucking shows.

1248
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:45,270
The same thing.
There's some people in a dark room 

1249
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,440
watching something through night vision 
and someone goes,

1250
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:50,450
what was that noise?
And then they go to commercial and then 

1251
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:51,940
they come back and it's nothing.
It's ridiculous.

1252
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:54,370
My mom,
I just got back from Ohio.

1253
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:55,040
My,
my home,

1254
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:57,370
my mom's house is supposedly haunted,
like,

1255
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:02,420
like my sister used to always talk about
it and then my mom is now talking about 

1256
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:02,420
it and my Stepdad,
he's like,

1257
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,990
he owned the architect firm and he's a 
really smart guy,

1258
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:07,660
you know,
huge corporation this guy had.

1259
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,820
And then he retired and he's a farmer,
you know,

1260
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:14,880
he's just a very intelligent guy.
And he said he saw it the other day and 

1261
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,010
then so it's just like,
all right,

1262
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:20,320
you guys,
stupid fucking gas leak or a mining leak

1263
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,770
somewhere that's giving you likely he's 
fucking your mom.

1264
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:28,510
Right?
That's what if you came to me.

1265
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:33,530
Okay,
what if there was like a sour well near 

1266
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:33,530
my mom's house farm?
What's going on here man?

1267
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:34,030
I said,
well,

1268
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:36,830
she's probably a little wacky.
I think there must be something,

1269
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,830
some kind of feelings going along with 
her.

1270
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:41,290
Radon gone bad.
The might be man.

1271
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:46,620
You know you grew up at a desktop radon 
radon test in your basement.

1272
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,010
Do you remember?
How about the shit that was on apple's.

1273
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,350
Oh yeah.
What was that?

1274
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,100
That was that,
that chemical.

1275
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:56,530
They use the spray that fertilizer on.
Is that what you're talking about?

1276
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:57,910
Remember,
there was a something

1277
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,370
that was on apples that were saying was 
dangerous for it.

1278
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,380
Do you remember that?
No.

1279
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:04,030
Fuck Shit.
What was it?

1280
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,200
And I was.
I don't remember what the fucking 

1281
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,971
chemical was.
I'm sure twitter will let me know on 

1282
00:59:11,971 --> 00:59:14,820
twitter.
Somebody please tell me what's the 

1283
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,760
fucking chemical was something or 
another.

1284
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,700
Oh,
all something you remember,

1285
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:23,710
something like that.
I know exactly what you're talking 

1286
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:23,710
about.
Wherever

1287
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:27,280
my dad actually has a patent to get 
radon out of your basement that he used 

1288
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,281
to build these machines for rich guys 
that like only you these so like maybe 

1289
00:59:30,281 --> 00:59:31,660
50 of them is totally legit.
No,

1290
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,710
it is.
It is legit.

1291
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,270
Yeah,
it's definitely an element.

1292
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:40,830
I'm sorry.
It's hidden in people's homes.

1293
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,080
Is it a health issue

1294
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,500
really,
really have to worry about.

1295
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:47,520
I don't think so.
I don't know.

1296
00:59:47,521 --> 00:59:50,730
I've never heard of anyone I knew dying 
of radon poisoning,

1297
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,150
but how did they get brought up?
Do you know?

1298
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,110
How did it become an issue?
I guess some people died somewhere.

1299
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,260
Well at some point they must have and it
does exist.

1300
01:00:01,261 --> 01:00:06,261
It is a element that leaks out of the 
earth and news that you've radioactive 

1301
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:06,261
gas that's nasty.

1302
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,020
So it's just a natural part of.
Yeah,

1303
01:00:09,021 --> 01:00:14,021
no,
it's not a result of nuclear testing or 

1304
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:14,021
anything like that.
It's a totally natural way.

1305
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:18,880
So do you think that people died because
there's just some areas where it would 

1306
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,310
just come through and heavy doses and no
one anticipated it?

1307
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,630
Is that what it was?
I think it's heavier than oxygen,

1308
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:28,631
if I remember correctly in sort of 
settles on in basements and your floors 

1309
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:32,960
and people sleep impulse of it and just.
And you can get radon poisoning,

1310
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:35,720
but you know,
it starts in your respiratory system and

1311
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:39,110
then you just start like wheezing and 
coughing a lot and shit like that.

1312
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,410
It's actually pretty crazy that it was 
so popular,

1313
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:45,590
but then it just died off like they were
still probably getting this.

1314
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,120
They did.
Did they find something new?

1315
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:48,230
Like oh by the way,
right.

1316
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:52,710
I'm poisoning is actually just now.
It's all about outside.

1317
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,440
Yeah.

1318
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:59,040
All it takes is like one death somewhere
and then all of a sudden everybody 

1319
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:03,901
starts chasing after him and he could 
have been one extreme example that was 

1320
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:07,891
very,
very rare and then everybody started 

1321
01:01:07,891 --> 01:01:09,790
chasing it and it's sensational stories.
If you have one good story about someone

1322
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:13,540
dying from some invisible chemical or 
even a drug or there you go.

1323
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:14,040
He's going to drug

1324
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,770
I won Pennsylvania to highest lauren's.
That's where their beer.

1325
01:01:16,771 --> 01:01:17,670
So good,
isn't it?

1326
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,150
He's men.
When you,

1327
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:24,180
when you stop and think about that.
So many of the different things that 

1328
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,780
you've talked about are not illegal,
you know,

1329
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:31,320
different psychoactive substances.
Like when you were talking to a Shogun 

1330
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,821
guy,
like all the different things that he 

1331
01:01:35,821 --> 01:01:37,561
was talking about,
the different tryptamines and how many 

1332
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:37,561
of them are illegal.
A lot of them are

1333
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:38,380
illegal.
Five mud,

1334
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,530
apt DMT.
Lot of them are maybe 11 or 12 of them,

1335
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,360
maybe more.
Probably about a dozen.

1336
01:01:44,361 --> 01:01:47,490
Tryptamines are illegal schedule one.
Uh,

1337
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:48,140
yeah.
No,

1338
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:53,141
it's ridiculous.
And a lot of them never had any real 

1339
01:01:53,141 --> 01:01:55,040
popularity in the first place.
Drugs like doe tea or something,

1340
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:58,670
or tma two were never particularly 
popular substances.

1341
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:04,160
Could you imagine if something like five
Meo dmt killed as many people year 

1342
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,380
cigarettes does?
Wouldn't that be amazing?

1343
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:10,350
Could you imagine how people would 
react?

1344
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:13,770
What a crisis they would be.
We've got to get this off the streets.

1345
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,170
Did you imagine with me one on one 
cigarettes,

1346
01:02:16,171 --> 01:02:16,950
do it.
It's like,

1347
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,990
well,
you shouldn't have been.

1348
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:20,250
Yeah,

1349
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,450
whoops.
Whoops.

1350
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,320
Yeah.
I mean,

1351
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:25,800
I wonder if nicotine would be legal if 
it were a recently discovered substance.

1352
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:29,310
Probably the nicotine is not as much of 
an issue.

1353
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,520
I think there's.
I think a lot of is all the other shit 

1354
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:34,520
they put in them to make it even more 
addictive.

1355
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:38,860
They say that if you smoke cigars,
you know people that smoke cigars,

1356
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,230
first of all,
you're not inhaling it,

1357
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:43,800
but you're getting like a real pure type
of tobacco.

1358
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:49,030
It doesn't have chemicals on it and it's
supposed to be not nearly as bad for 

1359
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:49,030
you.
It's not great for you.

1360
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:54,080
It's not the best thing for your sucking
on a crazy fucking plant that gives you 

1361
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,760
nicotine all day,
but what it is is a better,

1362
01:02:56,761 --> 01:03:01,761
healthier version of that tobacco and 
that the 599 different additives that 

1363
01:03:01,761 --> 01:03:06,501
the food and drug administration allows 
cigarette companies to pump in a 

1364
01:03:06,501 --> 01:03:07,590
cigarettes to just to make a mostly make
them more addictive.

1365
01:03:07,591 --> 01:03:09,690
I think.
Believe that movie with.

1366
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:11,190
What's his name?
What's homeboy's name?

1367
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:14,130
Fucking gladiator.
Dude was so crowded,

1368
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:19,131
so grow.
Remember that movie played a dude who 

1369
01:03:19,131 --> 01:03:20,010
was like the scientist who knew too much
about cigarettes,

1370
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,470
used in a real story that was terrifying
if any of that stuff,

1371
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:24,210
and I moved,
I can't even remember the movie,

1372
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,520
the movie's name or the actor's name,

1373
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,880
but they don't even need to.
I mean nicotine is incredibly addictive 

1374
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:31,880
without any kind of mysterious 
additives,

1375
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:36,560
but then there's also the Beta car 
booleans in tobacco that may give it an 

1376
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,930
additional addictive component because 
they may improve mood.

1377
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,700
When that movie he was talking about,
and again,

1378
01:03:42,701 --> 01:03:44,320
I don't know how much that movie's 
dramatically.

1379
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:45,730
I think it's based on a real story 
though,

1380
01:03:45,731 --> 01:03:48,030
isn't it?
I'm going to him.

1381
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:53,050
I remember I remember it being based on 
it or something like that.

1382
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,800
It was terrifying to think that a 
company would be so evil that they would

1383
01:03:56,801 --> 01:04:01,801
go out of their way to try to use 
chemists to make their shit more 

1384
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:02,770
addictive and you're like,
wow.

1385
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:04,840
Like that's a.
that's a really nutty choice.

1386
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:10,020
Five hundred and 99 is a lot.
When you find out they have 599 

1387
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,080
different chemicals they add to 
cigarettes.

1388
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:13,740
We're at one of the editors don't really
even make sense.

1389
01:04:13,741 --> 01:04:18,741
I've looked through the list that don't 
really stand wind eight shoes like what 

1390
01:04:18,741 --> 01:04:19,320
dean or.
Yeah,

1391
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:21,180
purity and would be an example 
disappeared.

1392
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:26,181
Then it's an aromatic six membered ring 
with the nitrogen in it that that is 

1393
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:33,410
just smells really bad and you wouldn't 
think that it would have any maybe to 

1394
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:34,950
counterbalance just tons of stuff.
It's like all these different.

1395
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,940
Just bad.
That's all it does as far as I know.

1396
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:40,590
And the quantities that they would be 
using it.

1397
01:04:40,591 --> 01:04:42,180
I can't.
I mean maybe it's like a in a really,

1398
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:47,181
you know,
in the same way that like Indole and 

1399
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:47,181
very,
very,

1400
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:47,181
very small quantities.
Smells like jasmine,

1401
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:49,020
but then in large quantity smells like 
shit.

1402
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,730
So some of these things that smelled 
bad,

1403
01:04:50,731 --> 01:04:53,670
it's probably used for smell to,
to sell a cigarette.

1404
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,670
Smoker doesn't smoke and they smell a 
cigarette.

1405
01:04:56,671 --> 01:04:58,350
You want a cigarette?
Bad.

1406
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:00,720
Really?
One hundred percent.

1407
01:05:00,721 --> 01:05:03,630
It's like having an apple pie.
When Apple Pie comes out of the oven and

1408
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,350
you smell apple pie,
you're like,

1409
01:05:04,351 --> 01:05:05,310
fuck,
I want that Apple Pie.

1410
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,650
Same reason.
They're probably making a smell,

1411
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
well,
I don't know if they're making it so 

1412
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,261
attractive to people,
but they'd probably making it more 

1413
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:14,261
attractive to the people that are 
smoking it.

1414
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:15,590
It's weird that it'd be a stinky thing.
You say a stinky thing.

1415
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,070
It's probably a mixture of different of 
stinky things that

1416
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,890
make the semester.
Some of them were just smells and so who

1417
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:23,020
the fuck knows know?
Like I said,

1418
01:05:23,021 --> 01:05:25,540
according to the Russell Crowe movie 
that I can't even remember the title.

1419
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:30,610
Right.
They like done some deep research on 

1420
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:32,710
hooking people and deeper and deeper 
with all these different 599 chemicals.

1421
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,750
It's just ridiculous.
That's too many.

1422
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,330
That's a lot.
It's very complicated.

1423
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:42,390
It's ridiculous.
Even when you're looking at the 

1424
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:42,390
interaction of two chemicals and once it
becomes incredibly complicated,

1425
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:43,810
think they constructed that lead me 
your.

1426
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,420
You understand that field.
How did they do that?

1427
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,160
I mean,
I'd have to look through the list of all

1428
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:49,300
the additives,
but I don't know.

1429
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:50,380
I mean,
it could just be,

1430
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:55,700
you know,
even things like any candy that any 

1431
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,070
child eats probably has an equivalent 
number of different chemicals in it.

1432
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,180
Um,
you know,

1433
01:05:58,181 --> 01:06:01,390
people that the word chemical always 
sounds bad,

1434
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,850
but it was 599 chemicals,
but there's a guarantee,

1435
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,190
599 chemicals in this,
in everything,

1436
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:11,230
in everything.
So it depends on how you want to phrase 

1437
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:11,230
it.
I don't know.

1438
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:11,230
I'm sure the majority of those chemicals
are benign,

1439
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:16,260
but maybe 11 of them do have some level 
of function.

1440
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:22,120
The are based on some tobacco industry 
plan to addict people,

1441
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:25,180
but I really do think that nicotine in 
and of itself would be enough.

1442
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:30,250
I think those are the people that smoke 
those natural cigarettes,

1443
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:35,251
those like in what do they,
do they experience less addiction?

1444
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:37,480
Uh,
no,

1445
01:06:37,481 --> 01:06:39,760
actually I,
I think that's where he hit me harder.

1446
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:42,950
Like I wake up spitting up like buckets 
at boobs,

1447
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:47,970
you know,
like just like having roommates hooks 

1448
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:47,970
them.
And is it just a major film producer?

1449
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:53,010
Maybe it's like a,
maybe some chemicals that cigarettes 

1450
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:53,010
make,
make it so that Burns easier.

1451
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:53,980
Oh yeah,
definitely.

1452
01:06:53,981 --> 01:06:58,981
I mean like,
like what most people smoke I would say 

1453
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,621
is Marlboro lights or camera lights or a
light cigarette and it's more like 

1454
01:07:01,621 --> 01:07:02,110
having a diet coke.
It's just like,

1455
01:07:02,111 --> 01:07:07,111
you know,
you just want a little taste of the 

1456
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:07,111
chemical and a little smoke,
but you're not.

1457
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:07,300
But then you get these guys that are 
like smoking.

1458
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:09,130
Marlboro reds were.
It's like having a little cigars,

1459
01:07:09,131 --> 01:07:10,210
you know,
it's harsh.

1460
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:10,660
It's.

1461
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:16,230
Have you ever seen the wonderful whites 
of West Virginia?

1462
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,160
No.
You've never seen it?

1463
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:20,710
What is it?
It's a crazy documentary that uh,

1464
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:25,720
they did all these people that live in 
West Virginia that have been notorious 

1465
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:30,631
family of outlaws and wild people.
And there was a woman and her name was 

1466
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:34,780
sue Bob and I swear to God that was her 
voice has always been a sex.

1467
01:07:34,781 --> 01:07:38,320
He wanted a family and just go and you 
just stop and think about that.

1468
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:43,060
So lifted cigarettes do to her man.
What did cigarettes do to her?

1469
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:47,200
Nobody sounds like that when they were a
woman without cigarettes.

1470
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,270
Like it's only cigarettes that they give
you that.

1471
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,310
I mean,
maybe some crazy exotic disease,

1472
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:55,330
but that's what she sounds like.
It's amazing.

1473
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,530
If you've never seen it,
man,

1474
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:58,510
if you just want something silly to 
watch,

1475
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,450
it's so well made.
It's a beautiful documentary.

1476
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,910
Johnny Knoxville's production company 
put it together.

1477
01:08:03,911 --> 01:08:06,490
It's really awesome.
It's about this family.

1478
01:08:06,491 --> 01:08:08,680
They're just awesome characters,
man.

1479
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:13,890
They just live in West Virginia and they
sell pills and they're just always 

1480
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:14,650
getting arrested.
It's just wild,

1481
01:08:14,651 --> 01:08:16,370
man.
It's so crazy

1482
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:17,600
to watch.
It's really,

1483
01:08:17,601 --> 01:08:20,960
really fun.
But cigarettes.

1484
01:08:20,961 --> 01:08:23,530
Fuck that chick's voice up.
You did.

1485
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:25,660
We didn't talk about that.
That guy that.

1486
01:08:25,661 --> 01:08:26,810
Uh,
what's his mic?

1487
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:27,980
Fannie Mae,
Fannie,

1488
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:30,680
whatever that guy's name is that's 
running for president in the marijuana.

1489
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:35,790
A Mitt Romney,
Mitt Romney man.

1490
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:37,630
Alright.
Yeah.

1491
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:42,650
That about him in the marijuana patient.
We remember we were going to talk about 

1492
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:42,650
that.
Yeah.

1493
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:43,070
Yeah.
That's crazy.

1494
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,100
I talked to you about it before we even 
did the show.

1495
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,800
It was so.
It was so sad to watch someone.

1496
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,280
It could be so callous about his ideas 
like that when some,

1497
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,170
if you haven't seen it,
Mitt Romney,

1498
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,970
guys running for president.
Very,

1499
01:08:55,971 --> 01:09:00,770
very wealthy man standing in front of 
this dude in a wheelchair.

1500
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,170
Guys like 80 pounds,
man,

1501
01:09:03,171 --> 01:09:05,090
I think he said he had muscular 
dystrophy.

1502
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:08,660
I apologize if I'm wrong about that,
but you know,

1503
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:14,020
he said to Mitt Romney that he needs 
medical marijuana and that medical 

1504
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:17,780
marijuana is the only thing that that 
helps him.

1505
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:21,560
And Mitt Romney said,
have you tried the synthetic form?

1506
01:09:21,561 --> 01:09:26,561
And he said it,
it makes me vomit and marijuana is the 

1507
01:09:26,561 --> 01:09:29,981
only thing that helps me.
Would you put me in jail if you became 

1508
01:09:29,981 --> 01:09:31,400
president?
Sure.

1509
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,900
Let's play it.
Let's see if it sounds good.

1510
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,340
All right,
let's see if it sounds good.

1511
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:38,930
It's really depressed and old video that
just really just became popular.

1512
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:39,830
Really.
Okay.

1513
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:41,230
It's so good.

1514
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:56,390
I have all my life,
my doctor saying that I want to that 

1515
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:02,570
medical marijuana for everyone and you 
have synthetic marijuana that's 

1516
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:09,810
available and other that I have tried it
and it makes me throw up.

1517
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:15,100
I have tried all the makeup and all the 
forms that come in after high 

1518
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:15,620
stimulator.
The steroids.

1519
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,050
I have muscular dystrophy that's 
completely against my DNA.

1520
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:24,370
I'm sorry to hear.
My question for you is will you arrest 

1521
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:28,071
me and my doctor's medical marijuana?
I'm not in favor of medical marijuana.

1522
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:32,320
How are you?

1523
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,600
She just turned away from the 
politician.

1524
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:36,850
Smile.
Hi,

1525
01:10:36,851 --> 01:10:41,851
how are you?
He asked if you were going to arrest 

1526
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:41,851
patients like him.
Governor,

1527
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:43,720
you're going to just ignore a person in 
a wheelchair.

1528
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:47,080
I spoke to them,
but he didn't answer his question.

1529
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,100
All right,
well this is good.

1530
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,640
So disturbing.
This is what we're doing.

1531
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:56,820
Hamilton Morris,
I think you got a good voice and you 

1532
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:56,820
should run for president.
Yeah,

1533
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:58,270
I'm pretty sure you could pull this off.
Why not?

1534
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:02,050
All right to it.
I don't think he's enthusiastic.

1535
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:06,640
Not Patronized.
It's shocking though,

1536
01:11:06,641 --> 01:11:11,641
isn't it?
That a person like that could be like 

1537
01:11:11,641 --> 01:11:13,321
even close,
remotely close to being able to run 

1538
01:11:13,321 --> 01:11:14,040
things the bit that you would be so

1539
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,350
cold hearted.
Just walk away from that dude like that.

1540
01:11:16,351 --> 01:11:17,850
That's like a serious issue,
man.

1541
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,670
You got to address that issue.
This guy's telling you there's something

1542
01:11:20,671 --> 01:11:22,980
that helps him and he's obviously in 
terrible,

1543
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,110
terrible straights.
The guys fucked up,

1544
01:11:25,111 --> 01:11:26,880
man.
He can't move,

1545
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:29,690
his body is in a God damn wheelchair and
he's telling you this.

1546
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:33,040
Something happened against this,
against his will.

1547
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,880
This is,
this is something that he's saying helps

1548
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:37,800
them make them feel happy against his 
pain,

1549
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:40,800
and he even said,
I'm not for legalizing it for anybody.

1550
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:42,540
He goes,
not for everybody,

1551
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:44,880
but for people that you can use it for 
medical purposes.

1552
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:49,881
It works.
It's you just walk away from God like 

1553
01:11:49,881 --> 01:11:50,330
that,
you know?

1554
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:56,580
It's just disturbing that anybody would 
be so flippant with the idea that it's,

1555
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:00,150
it's so.
It's so preposterous.

1556
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:03,360
It's so gross to them for some fucking 
reason.

1557
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:08,720
I don't know what it is,
but the idea of altering your 

1558
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,671
consciousness anyway,
other than the sanctioned ways that 

1559
01:12:10,671 --> 01:12:11,790
we've prescribed to for the last several
decades,

1560
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:14,100
anything that steps outside of that 
becomes a danger.

1561
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,660
I don't know why,
man,

1562
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:17,490
why you told me,
man,

1563
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:22,830
I dunno.
I mean it's not a majority view.

1564
01:12:22,831 --> 01:12:27,831
I don't think.
I think it had to do with a few people 

1565
01:12:27,831 --> 01:12:27,831
who,
you know,

1566
01:12:27,831 --> 01:12:29,970
when you think about it only takes a few
people to make these enormous changes in

1567
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:35,360
drug policy and like,
I don't know all that much about the 

1568
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,080
history of marijuana specifically,
but it was like that one guy primarily.

1569
01:12:37,081 --> 01:12:39,140
And then with the psychedelics,
it's the same kind of deal.

1570
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:43,080
It takes one person to die at the wrong 
time and you know,

1571
01:12:43,081 --> 01:12:45,900
one person dies after smoking.
Salvia,

1572
01:12:45,901 --> 01:12:46,940
the guy,
Brett cit,

1573
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,860
esther,
and then it's illegal over 10 states.

1574
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,350
Dude died,
smoke itself,

1575
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,380
you know,
he didn't even die.

1576
01:12:52,381 --> 01:12:52,770
I mean,
there's,

1577
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:57,270
there was a teenager named Brett cit,
esther who wrote in his diary,

1578
01:12:57,271 --> 01:13:00,000
I love Salvia it,
uh,

1579
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:03,210
but I also understand that life has no 
meaning now or something like that.

1580
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:08,210
And then a few days later he killed 
himself and his mother looked in his 

1581
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:08,210
diary and said,
oh,

1582
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:12,581
it was the Salvia than even suicidal and
went on this crusade to have it band in 

1583
01:13:12,581 --> 01:13:17,391
every state that she could and was 
successful in something like a dozen 

1584
01:13:17,391 --> 01:13:18,340
states.
It's called Brett's law.

1585
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:21,330
Wow.
But that's the way it always is.

1586
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:26,331
It's always one person that there's like
the that act based on the person that 

1587
01:13:26,331 --> 01:13:26,820
bought morphine on the Internet and 
overdosed.

1588
01:13:26,821 --> 01:13:31,821
It just takes one promising.
All the mushrooms and the Netherlands 

1589
01:13:31,821 --> 01:13:34,680
are now illegal because of care off the 
girl that jumped off the bridge.

1590
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:39,820
Just one promising person whose photo 
looks good on the news dies.

1591
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:42,810
And that's the end.
But what did she do?

1592
01:13:42,811 --> 01:13:44,720
She got mushroomed up and jumped off the
bridge.

1593
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,280
It's unclear.
I mean that was the,

1594
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:50,010
the official idea that was written in 
the news.

1595
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:53,910
But then when I was in Holland recently 
working on this new project for VBS,

1596
01:13:53,911 --> 01:13:56,760
we were at this place called magic 
truffles,

1597
01:13:56,761 --> 01:14:00,420
which is the largest mushroom,
or was largest mushroom farm in Holland.

1598
01:14:00,421 --> 01:14:03,810
They make metric tons of mushrooms in 
this factory.

1599
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:09,020
And,
but then mushrooms became illegal so 

1600
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:09,020
they converted their entire operation to
producing psychedelics.

1601
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:11,590
Clarissa.
But they say the whole thing is a scam.

1602
01:14:11,591 --> 01:14:12,930
They think that,
uh,

1603
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:16,330
that she wasn't even on mushrooms at the
entire thing is based on a friend seeing

1604
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:21,331
her with a box of mushrooms in her hand.
But on the day of the death and then 

1605
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:26,041
they put two and two together and 
decided that she must have been on 

1606
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:26,041
mushrooms,
which he died.

1607
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:27,250
Oh God.
So she could have just been depressed.

1608
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:32,251
Yeah.
I don't think there are any toxicology 

1609
01:14:32,251 --> 01:14:33,520
reports that confirmed she was under the
influence of any psilocybin at the time.

1610
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,040
I can get not wanting to give it to 
everybody.

1611
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,430
I just think there should be places 
where you can get at where someone could

1612
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,560
walk you through it and you should be 
able to make an educated choice.

1613
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:48,800
There's just so many people shouldn't be
denied the experience because I think 

1614
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,680
the experience makes people more aware 
and more sensitive and that.

1615
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:56,690
I only think that that's good.
I think the world can use a lot more 

1616
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:58,800
aware and more sensitive.
So why aren't there centers set up?

1617
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:02,070
Why is it still illegal?
That's where it gets completely,

1618
01:15:02,071 --> 01:15:04,520
totally ridiculous.
It gets to the point where you're.

1619
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:09,570
You're keeping something that might be 
beneficial to a lot of people because 

1620
01:15:09,841 --> 01:15:13,950
some people might fuck it up because 
some people might fuck with it.

1621
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:15,000
Do something crazy.

1622
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:18,510
It also has to do with fashion in 
science and medicine,

1623
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:23,530
you know,
it became very unfashionable in the 

1624
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:23,670
eighties to do psychedelic psychotherapy
and uh,

1625
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:28,760
and there were only a number even in 
places like there certain parts of 

1626
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,600
Germany where any,
any psychiatrists that wanted to could,

1627
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:35,840
and they chose not to just because most 
people weren't interested in it for 

1628
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,351
awhile.
They thought it had limited potential 

1629
01:15:39,351 --> 01:15:39,351
and now I think the potential is,
you know,

1630
01:15:39,351 --> 01:15:41,880
there's the renewal evolved,
the psychedelic research,

1631
01:15:41,881 --> 01:15:46,881
but in the eighties people didn't think 
it was even people that were pro 

1632
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:48,250
psychedelic drugs,
they just didn't have,

1633
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:53,330
a lot of them didn't necessarily think 
that it was a viable road to producing 

1634
01:15:53,461 --> 01:15:58,110
important neuroscientific research or in
terms of psychotherapeutic drugs.

1635
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:04,630
Yeah.
I recall hearing a Mckenna interview 

1636
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:07,781
where he was talking about that,
about how scientists were often like 

1637
01:16:07,781 --> 01:16:09,980
discouraged from going down those paths 
because people would say like,

1638
01:16:09,981 --> 01:16:14,981
you know,
there's not really nothing there for 

1639
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:14,981
you.

1640
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:14,981
Well,
yeah,

1641
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:14,981
it's hard.
It's hard to.

1642
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:17,210
It's difficult to quantify the benefits 
of psychedelic drugs like a lot.

1643
01:16:17,211 --> 01:16:22,211
There's a lot of anecdotal evidence that
they have lasting effects on people's 

1644
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:25,571
lives and that they have relief from 
depression or alcoholism or things like 

1645
01:16:25,571 --> 01:16:27,230
that,
but when it comes down to really,

1646
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:32,500
really putting it down on paper,
it's been difficult and an often it's 

1647
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:37,821
things like the Johns Hopkins study 
where silicide been occasions long 

1648
01:16:37,821 --> 01:16:39,950
lasting mystical experiences.
That famous paper,

1649
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,780
a really recent one.
Yeah.

1650
01:16:41,781 --> 01:16:43,220
The reason why it's getting a huge 
amount of press,

1651
01:16:43,221 --> 01:16:44,600
but it's amazing.
Yeah,

1652
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,120
because they said that it improved their
personalities.

1653
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:52,170
Yeah.
But even that is kind of slippery when 

1654
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:54,390
it's a mystical experience.
All these terms are slippery and if you,

1655
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:59,520
you know,
when you look at a nootropic that was 

1656
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,180
very defined studies of how something 
does it aid road into navigating amaze,

1657
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:06,670
does it allow them to,
does it allow a human,

1658
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:08,990
does it prevent the formation of certain
types?

1659
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:15,010
Disease or proteins in the brain are 
things that that are indicative of 

1660
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:19,691
neurodegenerative diseases,
but there isn't anything like that for 

1661
01:17:19,691 --> 01:17:23,501
psychedelics.
There's no single benefit that can be 

1662
01:17:23,501 --> 01:17:24,460
quantified.
And uh,

1663
01:17:24,461 --> 01:17:27,420
and I think that's one reason that it's 
difficult for researchers is.

1664
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:32,780
And then there's ways around it with now
a lot of people try to emphasize the 

1665
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:33,770
positive effects that are not 
necessarily psychoactive,

1666
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:38,771
so maybe they have some kind of an 
immunosuppressant effect that would be 

1667
01:17:38,771 --> 01:17:38,950
useful for our,
uh,

1668
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:44,050
for arthritis or some kind of 
inflammatory disease or something like 

1669
01:17:44,241 --> 01:17:45,140
that.
That's one of the,

1670
01:17:45,141 --> 01:17:48,140
you said that because there was 
something I was reading just a couple of

1671
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:53,140
days ago about people juicing cannabis 
and that doesn't have any psychoactive 

1672
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:58,631
effects,
but there's a lot of great health 

1673
01:17:58,631 --> 01:17:58,631
benefits.
Absolutely.

1674
01:17:58,631 --> 01:18:00,920
Using it in cbd,
the non psychoactive Terpene,

1675
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:05,210
one of thc and cbd are the two main 
chemicals in.

1676
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:09,140
So would you juice it like a smoothie,
like blended up?

1677
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:09,660
Oh,
I don't know about.

1678
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:11,780
I don't know about this specific 
technique,

1679
01:18:11,781 --> 01:18:15,950
but cbd is not psychoactive and has all 
kinds of a medicinal effects.

1680
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:19,670
Like it's currently undergoing clinical 
trials as a treatment for schizophrenia.

1681
01:18:19,671 --> 01:18:22,720
So I mean,
in addition to the psychedelic effect,

1682
01:18:22,721 --> 01:18:24,700
there may be all kinds of things we can,
you know,

1683
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:28,610
maybe neuro regenerative,
maybe synaptic Magenic,

1684
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,640
maybe all sorts of different things.
The marijuana one is the biggest trip 

1685
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,720
because it's got so many excellent 
properties yet it's illegal.

1686
01:18:35,721 --> 01:18:38,950
It makes the best paper.
It makes the best clothes,

1687
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,730
like the fibers.
Excellent.

1688
01:18:40,731 --> 01:18:45,731
You can make like wall board out of it.
There's like four times stronger than 

1689
01:18:45,731 --> 01:18:49,421
plywood.
It's like a really incredible plan 

1690
01:18:49,421 --> 01:18:50,660
because it's super strong like have you 
ever picked up a hemp stalk?

1691
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:51,860
It's really weird,
man.

1692
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:55,130
It's like from another planet because 
it's really fucking strong,

1693
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:55,630
but it's light.

1694
01:18:55,630 --> 01:19:00,630
It's shit.
Like you pick it up and it's like this 

1695
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:03,191
is a weird kind of wood.
If it seems strange and it has so much 

1696
01:19:03,191 --> 01:19:08,081
fucking potential as far as like you 
could like you can grow like a massive 

1697
01:19:08,331 --> 01:19:13,331
forest full of it,
chop it all down and then have another 

1698
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:16,350
massive forest like six months later,
a year later when it's renewable,

1699
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:20,270
you could do it over and over again and 
all the health benefits,

1700
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:22,100
all that.
It's like it's from another planet.

1701
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:24,950
It's really crazy drug.
When you think about all the good things

1702
01:19:24,951 --> 01:19:26,320
it does,
it's great and it had.

1703
01:19:26,321 --> 01:19:30,530
The seeds are awesome source of protein.
It has all the essential amino acids.

1704
01:19:30,531 --> 01:19:32,360
It's actually good for you if you juice 
it,

1705
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:33,500
if you smoke it,
you get high,

1706
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:38,501
you feel amazing.
It's like it couldn't do any more for 

1707
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:38,501
you.
Come on man.

1708
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:40,190
You can make paper out of me.
You want to make clothes out of me dude,

1709
01:19:40,191 --> 01:19:42,470
you can eat my oil.
My oil is really good for you.

1710
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:47,790
It can power cars too.
It's like I'm renewable every six 

1711
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:51,101
months.
I mean it's like it couldn't be any 

1712
01:19:51,101 --> 01:19:52,781
nicer to you.
It couldn't be any more of a productive 

1713
01:19:52,781 --> 01:19:56,480
plant.
Know as far as like society just uses as

1714
01:19:57,370 --> 01:19:58,790
you know,
as a quantity,

1715
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:02,360
as you know,
uses as a something that you could sell.

1716
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:07,920
Absolutely.
And it's the same thing with mushrooms 

1717
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,460
as well and if so many benefits beyond 
just being

1718
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:11,190
vessels for carrying these psychoactive 
drugs.

1719
01:20:11,191 --> 01:20:16,191
You know,
I think Paul stamets did a lot of 

1720
01:20:16,191 --> 01:20:18,320
experiments with the Defense Department 
using either a p scion essence or as 

1721
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:21,260
their essence and using them to d 
phosphorolate,

1722
01:20:21,261 --> 01:20:26,261
seren to break breakdown nerve gases 
because in the same way that all of 

1723
01:20:26,261 --> 01:20:30,861
these enzymes in the mycelium that are 
able to break down the cellular 

1724
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:36,291
components of the substrate,
whether it's wood or grass or some kind 

1725
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:41,271
of seed,
it's able to break it down and extract 

1726
01:20:41,271 --> 01:20:41,970
all of these amino acids and then bios 
synthesize chemicals out of it,

1727
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:47,150
but uh,
but it can also break down all other 

1728
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:50,091
kinds of substrates,
like there's all this bio remediation 

1729
01:20:50,091 --> 01:20:53,091
where they use mushrooms to clean up oil
spills because the mushroom mycelium is 

1730
01:20:53,091 --> 01:20:56,511
able to break down the aromatic 
hydrocarbons in the oil and to totally 

1731
01:20:56,511 --> 01:21:01,371
detoxify.
You can even eat the mushrooms 

1732
01:21:01,371 --> 01:21:01,371
afterwards.
Wow.

1733
01:21:01,371 --> 01:21:01,371
I,
I'd heard of it

1734
01:21:01,371 --> 01:21:05,660
about something like that,
that they use things like that in 

1735
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:05,660
Alaska.
Is that what they experienced?

1736
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:09,531
That,
where that was the before the Gulf 

1737
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:09,531
incident.
That was like the last big,

1738
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:09,910
right?
Yeah.

1739
01:21:09,911 --> 01:21:14,911
They tried to.
They wanted to do it in Japan as well 

1740
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:17,131
too,
to clean up radioactive waste because 

1741
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:18,721
you realized the mushrooms to 
bioaccumulate radioactive fallout and 

1742
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:21,970
then pick the mushrooms and slowly 
decontaminate and area.

1743
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,740
I mean it's an extremely slow way to do 
it,

1744
01:21:23,741 --> 01:21:26,020
but it also effective.
Wow.

1745
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:28,030
It would take hundreds of years.
Well,

1746
01:21:28,031 --> 01:21:30,610
what other options are there?
I mean that's the thing.

1747
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:36,380
Imagine that's the best way to do it,
but then once you get the mushrooms to 

1748
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:38,190
eat it and then you have to pick up the 
mushrooms.

1749
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:39,780
The mushrooms are still radioactive,
right?

1750
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:44,950
That's right.
For how long until the decay of the 

1751
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:47,650
radioactive atoms.
Hundreds of thousands of years.

1752
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:52,880
Yeah.
So it's essentially just moving the 

1753
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:52,880
problem to another area.
Yeah,

1754
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,501
but at least you're concentrating it.
It's better to have like a 20 drums of 

1755
01:21:56,501 --> 01:21:59,810
radioactive mushrooms in a concrete 
vault somewhere than to have it covering

1756
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:01,370
100 miles of land

1757
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:04,280
eventually.
Panting is so terrifying to me because I

1758
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:08,060
have no understanding whatsoever how 
nuclear power works.

1759
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:10,940
I just always took it for granted.
You never even thought about it.

1760
01:22:10,941 --> 01:22:15,941
I never.
And then I just recently found out that 

1761
01:22:15,941 --> 01:22:17,490
it's about making steam.
It's about like somehow or another loop,

1762
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:22,540
the nuclear thing.
It's like the power comes from Steve 

1763
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:22,540
Powers things,
steam turbines,

1764
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:23,450
steam turbines.
I'm like,

1765
01:22:23,451 --> 01:22:25,670
wow.
That seems like so old school,

1766
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:26,470
you know,
it's just,

1767
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,900
they're using this super powerful fire 
to boil water.

1768
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,850
You know what I mean?
It sounds ridiculous.

1769
01:22:31,851 --> 01:22:32,360
I mean,
my,

1770
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,220
my simplification of it sounds 
ridiculous,

1771
01:22:34,221 --> 01:22:39,221
but when you find out that their spots 
now where there's just no one's ever 

1772
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:40,850
going to be able to go there.
And then when you can't go there,

1773
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:44,120
you can't go there.
That's fucked for forever for.

1774
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:47,260
We probably won't even be people anymore
because you know,

1775
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,460
100,000
years ago we weren't even this,

1776
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:51,530
right?
We were like barely this as a,

1777
01:22:51,531 --> 01:22:56,531
as an organism where we're essentially a
little bit more of a monkey than we are 

1778
01:22:56,531 --> 01:22:59,210
now.
By the time that shit's done,

1779
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:04,690
what are people going to be like?
By the time that's not radioactive 

1780
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:06,790
anymore,
we're not even going to be people 

1781
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:06,790
anymore.
We'll probably be some new shit.

1782
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:06,790
We all have autism

1783
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:09,460
and it will probably be just like the 
grays dude,

1784
01:23:09,461 --> 01:23:11,740
just crazy.
Something like that to the graded trip.

1785
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:16,741
He's going to happen.
We're going to be assimilated with the 

1786
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:16,741
machine.
Yeah,

1787
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:16,741
that's my conclusion.

1788
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:18,050
Yeah.

1789
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,680
Assimilated with the machine.
What do you think's going to happen?

1790
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,300
Something's going on.

1791
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:25,820
I don't know.
I mean,

1792
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:28,310
I don't know.
Think about it.

1793
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:30,050
I do think about it.
I just don't.

1794
01:23:30,051 --> 01:23:31,910
It's difficult if anything seems 
possible.

1795
01:23:31,911 --> 01:23:36,911
It's just like with any.
Any issue where it seems as if it could 

1796
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:37,760
go one way.
I certainly am a pessimist ultimately,

1797
01:23:37,761 --> 01:23:42,761
and I'd like to be an optimist.
Are you a pessimist as far as the 

1798
01:23:42,761 --> 01:23:46,271
potential that the human race can reach 
or as you put about the possible 

1799
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:50,561
outcomes?
Are you a pessimist about people in 

1800
01:23:50,561 --> 01:23:50,561
general?
I mean,

1801
01:23:50,561 --> 01:23:52,250
I got into an argument with a Daniel 
Pinchbeck recently about,

1802
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:55,130
about,
about aliens,

1803
01:23:55,131 --> 01:23:57,280
and he has this very optimistic idea 
that if aliens.

1804
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:59,090
He told me he goes,
definitely exists.

1805
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,920
He,
he believes a lot of things that I 

1806
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:04,920
definitely said he's very open.

1807
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:11,620
Well,
I enjoyed talking about before we say 

1808
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:11,620
anything further.
Oh yeah,

1809
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:12,590
no,
I enjoyed talking to him.

1810
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:13,520
Yeah,
just playing.

1811
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:14,750
But uh,
so,

1812
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,210
so what happened,
aliens.

1813
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:21,240
We were talking about Stephen Hawking 
and Stephen Hawking has this idea that 

1814
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:25,301
if we ever do make contact with aliens,
the best move would be to ignore them 

1815
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:27,110
because if,
if they ever come to our planet,

1816
01:24:27,111 --> 01:24:30,080
the chances are they're not only going 
to exploit us but destroy us.

1817
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:35,260
I mean,
you didn't say exactly those words 

1818
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:35,260
would.
He generally has a,

1819
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,860
a pessimistic view.
And I think that that's a well informed 

1820
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:40,811
intelligent view.
There's no reason to have an optimistic 

1821
01:24:40,811 --> 01:24:43,601
view about that,
but Daniel Pinchbeck seems to have this 

1822
01:24:43,601 --> 01:24:43,601
idea that,
uh,

1823
01:24:43,601 --> 01:24:43,601
that,
you know,

1824
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:47,000
touristic Gilliam friends and we'll 
drink sweet.

1825
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,700
So sweet.
Um,

1826
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:50,830
I don't think so.
Look at,

1827
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:55,070
if you look at every single organism 
that we can observe on this earth,

1828
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:56,990
it takes advantage of the week or 
organisms,

1829
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:58,520
including the most intelligent.

1830
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,020
We take advantage of dolphins.
We put them.

1831
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:01,340
Absolutely.
That's exactly what I was saying.

1832
01:25:01,341 --> 01:25:04,040
As we look into killer whales,
we don't give a fuck.

1833
01:25:04,041 --> 01:25:09,041
We put,
we locked them up in tanks and we know 

1834
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:09,041
they're intelligent.
We just can't understand them,

1835
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:10,270
and so we forced him into slavery that's
not mentioned humans to humans,

1836
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:15,280
the keys to the doors and we we,
but with animals that we don't 

1837
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:15,800
understand,
intelligent animals,

1838
01:25:15,801 --> 01:25:20,801
we understand.
We regularly enslave them for people's 

1839
01:25:20,801 --> 01:25:23,981
enjoyment to watch on television,
and then we believe somehow or another 

1840
01:25:23,981 --> 01:25:27,641
that some super intelligent organism is 
going to show different behavior than 

1841
01:25:27,641 --> 01:25:29,660
what every single organism on this 
earth,

1842
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,330
including the highest us,
the most aware us.

1843
01:25:32,331 --> 01:25:35,570
We do it worse than any of them.
We do it worse than dolphins.

1844
01:25:35,571 --> 01:25:37,820
We do it worse than killer whales.
We have chimps.

1845
01:25:37,821 --> 01:25:39,560
We locked chimps up.
We don't give a fuck.

1846
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:44,610
You make humane people.
People that love to still keep them in 

1847
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:44,610
or people that love champs,
keep them in cages.

1848
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:49,541
People's love.
Dolphins keep them in tanks not 

1849
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:51,131
literally kept himself into the tank,
so even if they were trying to be nice 

1850
01:25:51,131 --> 01:25:55,241
to us,
who's to say that it wouldn't be some 

1851
01:25:55,241 --> 01:25:55,241
nightmarish.
It's fucking hell for that dolphin,

1852
01:25:55,241 --> 01:25:56,210
man.
It's got to be hell.

1853
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:57,410
They're.
They're intelligent.

1854
01:25:57,411 --> 01:26:02,411
They're just.
They just can't change their 

1855
01:26:02,411 --> 01:26:02,411
environment.
We know they have dialects and they have

1856
01:26:02,411 --> 01:26:04,050
crazy Alexis societal and you

1857
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:05,920
know dolphins have.
There's this,

1858
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:11,190
they have a huge attachment to their 
family and their loved ones to just 

1859
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:11,900
snatch one up and stick it in a fish 
tank.

1860
01:26:11,901 --> 01:26:13,910
It's fucked up,
but we do it.

1861
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:16,610
Why would we think that aliens wouldn't 
do that to us?

1862
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:21,820
We are crazy.
Could you imagine if you came down here 

1863
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:24,791
and you watch all these little pink 
monkeys with their fucking bank stigs 

1864
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:28,331
and nuclear weapons.
You found out that people had nuclear 

1865
01:26:28,331 --> 01:26:28,331
weapons.
You know,

1866
01:26:28,331 --> 01:26:28,331
you see him at home,
slack,

1867
01:26:28,331 --> 01:26:30,740
jawed watching the Kardashians.
We have nuclear weapons,

1868
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:35,950
the same animal.
You know the same animal and it's all 

1869
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:35,950
going on right now.

1870
01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:41,610
Imitate aliens who is probably cute.
Want to shut this whole fucking show 

1871
01:26:41,741 --> 01:26:42,580
down?
You'd be like,

1872
01:26:42,581 --> 01:26:45,190
you're going to ruin this whole planet.
You stupid fucks.

1873
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:47,650
You would want to come as we would for 
sure.

1874
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:52,740
Shut this planet down.
If we came into an area and there was a 

1875
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:56,701
budget champs and the chimps had machine
guns and tanks and we would shut that 

1876
01:26:56,701 --> 01:27:01,621
fucking place down.
There's no way we're going to let some 

1877
01:27:01,621 --> 01:27:01,630
chimps start running shit.
We would take all their weapons.

1878
01:27:01,631 --> 01:27:04,750
We'd go Jesus Christ who gave chimps 
these fucking tanks,

1879
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:07,120
what chimps do and flying around in 
jets.

1880
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:12,270
We would totally steal their shit.
Who would never allow that image of 

1881
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:13,660
chimps started coming into our towns and
stealing our cars and shit.

1882
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:17,710
There'll be a real issue.
We wouldn't allow that.

1883
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:24,270
We would take our shit take from those 
dumb monkeys and that's what they would 

1884
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:24,270
do.

1885
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:28,740
They would come down,
they would steal our cars or iphone.

1886
01:27:29,921 --> 01:27:30,520
Excuse me.
That.

1887
01:27:30,521 --> 01:27:32,290
How'd you figure this out?
You fucking dummy.

1888
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:33,840
They would take your iphone.
Oh,

1889
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:35,230
check you out.
Look what you did.

1890
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:38,770
Did you figure this out?
Think about the average person.

1891
01:27:38,771 --> 01:27:40,630
How stupid there.
And they have an iphone in their pocket.

1892
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:42,820
Boom.
And they don't know how to use it.

1893
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:45,460
Yeah,
so pinchbeck thinks so they would all go

1894
01:27:45,461 --> 01:27:47,150
IOWASCA style.
Yeah.

1895
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:49,870
They would have a song prepared.
Hello humans,

1896
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,670
we want to.
We prepared this for you.

1897
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:56,740
We will eat at the buffet is the day the
Earth stood still the other day?

1898
01:27:56,950 --> 01:27:59,530
Have you ever seen that?
I have been since I was a child.

1899
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:01,330
Wow.
It was amazing.

1900
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:05,050
It was like I was watching a movie.
It was Kinda cool.

1901
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,310
You know,
it's kind of cool because you know,

1902
01:28:06,311 --> 01:28:09,790
you put yourself back in that sort of 
like old school comic books,

1903
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:12,970
style of storytelling.
They did in the fifties and the innocent

1904
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:15,300
days when they made that movie.
But the other thing was like,

1905
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:20,310
oh,
how naive like the portrait of like an 

1906
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:20,310
alien,
what it would be and you know,

1907
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:25,201
just how naive the situation was in the 
military and every obvious bad guys and 

1908
01:28:25,961 --> 01:28:28,510
good guys,
like how naive but yet,

1909
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:35,310
how do you know who even now there's 
really no impressive concept of aliens.

1910
01:28:35,441 --> 01:28:40,441
That's what.
I don't know if you're familiar with 

1911
01:28:40,441 --> 01:28:40,441
this science fiction writers Stanislaw 
Lem,

1912
01:28:40,441 --> 01:28:41,350
but he wrote Solaris and his master's 
voice and all these books in.

1913
01:28:41,351 --> 01:28:46,351
His main idea is that humans can't 
conceive of anything that is truly 

1914
01:28:46,351 --> 01:28:50,611
alien.
We're only looking for ourselves in the 

1915
01:28:50,611 --> 01:28:50,611
universe in anything that was truly 
unlike us.

1916
01:28:50,611 --> 01:28:50,740
We couldn't even imagine.

1917
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:54,410
Right.
So even like the movie alien still isn't

1918
01:28:54,411 --> 01:28:57,380
thing.
Not even like it could be a living ocean

1919
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,680
or living planet,
write a plan,

1920
01:29:00,681 --> 01:29:01,410
and with consciousness,

1921
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:07,370
that's always been a fascinating idea 
that everything has some sort of 

1922
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:08,100
consciousness,
you know,

1923
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:13,160
whether or not a expresses pain or even 
feels it or can't communicate that 

1924
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:16,230
everything has some sort of a,
a type of consciousness will definitely.

1925
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:19,320
Our idea of life is generally very 
narrow,

1926
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:24,180
like a budding field of astrobiology,
which is just a speculative science,

1927
01:29:24,181 --> 01:29:27,360
but even in astrobiology textbooks from 
a couple of years ago,

1928
01:29:27,361 --> 01:29:29,370
there would be no mention of the 
possibility that,

1929
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:34,650
uh,
that arsenic could replace phosphorous 

1930
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:34,840
in bio molecules.
It didn't even seem like a possibility.

1931
01:29:34,841 --> 01:29:36,990
And now we know that that can happen.
How does that work?

1932
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:37,830
What,
what happens?

1933
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:40,320
There was like a,
a lake,

1934
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:42,930
I think it's in Nevada that had 
extremely,

1935
01:29:42,931 --> 01:29:44,910
extremely high levels of arsenic in the 
water.

1936
01:29:44,911 --> 01:29:47,730
And this researcher is last name is 
felice.

1937
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:52,760
I think a collected bacteria from the 
lake and found that they were producing 

1938
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:57,630
dna and amino acids where the 
phosphorous atom that's present in a lot

1939
01:29:57,631 --> 01:30:00,240
of these molecules was replaced by 
arsenic.

1940
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:01,450
Whoa.
Yeah.

1941
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,320
I had arsenic poisoning from eating 
sardines.

1942
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:05,420
I told you that,
right?

1943
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:07,560
Yeah.
I ate too many sardines.

1944
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:09,420
I was eating learn Qantas or deans a day
or so.

1945
01:30:09,421 --> 01:30:10,470
Funny.
Who does that?

1946
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:13,590
No one.
The only person that likes sardines.

1947
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:17,610
Are they a good source of arsenic?
Why?

1948
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:22,730
Apparently,
or at least sardines there they feed on 

1949
01:30:22,730 --> 01:30:24,870
heavy metal or will they don't feed on 
heavy metal,

1950
01:30:24,871 --> 01:30:28,440
but they feed at the bottom of the ocean
and that's where a lot of pollution as a

1951
01:30:28,441 --> 01:30:30,680
lot of the heavy metal pollution and 
they,

1952
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:35,920
they get a concentration of arsenic not 
enough to really to make you sick but 

1953
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,241
enough that shows up on tests.
So you get your blood checked and he 

1954
01:30:39,241 --> 01:30:39,241
said,
who should have some arsenic in there?

1955
01:30:39,241 --> 01:30:41,040
What the fuck is going on?
Like someone's trying to kill me slowly.

1956
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,990
Or is it sardines?
Turns out it was hard Ns.

1957
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:45,320
Hmm.

1958
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:50,670
What if you could get turquoise point,
like poisoning,

1959
01:30:50,671 --> 01:30:53,700
like if you like constantly ate a little
bit of turquoise everyday.

1960
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:55,850
Like if is turquoise toxic.
I don't know.

1961
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:57,330
It's in stone.
Yeah.

1962
01:30:57,331 --> 01:31:02,331
But if you like,
shaved it down into a powder and put it 

1963
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:02,331
in some proteins and stuff.
I don't know.

1964
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:04,140
I don't know what the chemical 
composition of voices,

1965
01:31:04,141 --> 01:31:07,140
but you just don't study show that 
doesn't get you fucked up.

1966
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:07,710
No,
I do.

1967
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:10,650
How do you know what?
It's the best thing ever.

1968
01:31:10,651 --> 01:31:12,230
It's a pretty.
Maybe that's.

1969
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:15,120
That's a terrible question,
but it leads to a half decent one.

1970
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:18,510
How do you think they've discovered all 
the psychedelic substances on earth?

1971
01:31:18,511 --> 01:31:19,990
Or do you think?
No,

1972
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:25,520
not even close.
When I first saw Alexander Seligman's 

1973
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,761
work and saw call,
I was discouraged by it because I 

1974
01:31:28,761 --> 01:31:31,341
thought that it had all been done that 
every single possible psychoactive 

1975
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:35,340
tryptamine and ethylamine had already 
been sent in from people who don't know.

1976
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:40,370
Picasso is Phil.
What is it that I had known then that 

1977
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:43,920
means I've known and loved and 
tryptamines I've known and loved in 

1978
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,431
there.
These two enormous thousand plus page 

1979
01:31:46,431 --> 01:31:48,360
books written by a chemist in California
named Alexander Silgan and they contain,

1980
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:53,370
knew least about 100 drugs that he's 
synthesized and these two chemical 

1981
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:56,220
classes in each volume and it looks 
pretty comprehensive.

1982
01:31:56,221 --> 01:31:59,620
It looks as if he's evaluated every 
imaginable psychedelic,

1983
01:31:59,621 --> 01:32:01,360
but that's only a fraction of what's 
possible.

1984
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:06,390
I love that interview that you had with 
a man because I had never seen a guy 

1985
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:09,250
like that in the wild.
I'd never seen some super chemists.

1986
01:32:09,251 --> 01:32:12,070
Dude is created like God knows how many 
common auditory.

1987
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:14,590
So how many times has he created 
something,

1988
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:17,190
some new cool thing or discovered some 
new cool things.

1989
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,070
It's hundreds.
Yeah.

1990
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:19,690
How many has he documented?
It's amazing,

1991
01:32:19,691 --> 01:32:20,500
right?
Enormous,

1992
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:20,800
enormous.

1993
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:25,810
Don't incredible.
And that he's sitting there just 

1994
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:27,991
rattling all this information off to you
and you were like a fucking kid in a 

1995
01:32:27,991 --> 01:32:28,450
candy store that you could tell.
You were like,

1996
01:32:28,451 --> 01:32:33,451
wow.
Like you couldn't believe you were 

1997
01:32:33,451 --> 01:32:33,910
hanging out with him.
I'm so cool that the enthusiasm,

1998
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:39,150
like it really came through like the 
your honest enthusiasm to be hanging 

1999
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:39,670
around with this guy.
It really.

2000
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:44,671
You had an educated sense of reverence 
about what he's done.

2001
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:47,440
So it's like when you addressed all 
these things,

2002
01:32:47,441 --> 01:32:51,400
like you could tell that you had this 
great joy in getting this opportunity to

2003
01:32:51,401 --> 01:32:52,480
talk to that guy.
Oh yeah.

2004
01:32:52,481 --> 01:32:55,450
It was really cool.
I love him with a passion.

2005
01:32:55,451 --> 01:32:57,430
He is one of the most amazing 
scientists.

2006
01:32:57,490 --> 01:32:58,900
Talk a little watch that.
What is,

2007
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:00,040
how can I find that?
What is it?

2008
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:05,420
If you type Hamilton's Pharmacopia,
that's the name of my show on vbs.

2009
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:07,600
Uh,
you can find it on vice.com

2010
01:33:07,601 --> 01:33:10,240
through the video section if you just 
look for Hamilton's Pharmacopia.

2011
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:12,760
Uh,
but yeah,

2012
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:17,761
I mean he's in it and I seen him quite a
few times since then and it really is a 

2013
01:33:17,761 --> 01:33:21,901
privilege because his entire methodology
is one that's not followed anymore.

2014
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:26,971
It's like it seems very antiquated to 
most young people and even 

2015
01:33:26,971 --> 01:33:27,520
pharmaceutical researchers,
the idea that,

2016
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:28,900
that,
uh,

2017
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:32,050
anyone would take a drug that they 
synthesize is ridiculous,

2018
01:33:32,051 --> 01:33:33,580
but that totally,
totally normal.

2019
01:33:33,581 --> 01:33:35,200
They used to be the way drugs are 
developed.

2020
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:41,460
The chemistry invented Ritalin,
took it after he synthesized it and 

2021
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:42,280
tried it and didn't really get much from
it.

2022
01:33:42,281 --> 01:33:47,281
Then he gave it to his wife Rita,
and she loved it and said that it 

2023
01:33:47,281 --> 01:33:48,740
improved her tennis game and so he named
it after her Rita Lynn.

2024
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:54,120
Oh Wow.
But that kind of thing was calm and 

2025
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:54,120
improved her tennis game because it's 
essentially like speed,

2026
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:54,160
right?

2027
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:59,220
Yeah.
It's like cocaine or how does that work 

2028
01:33:59,220 --> 01:33:59,220
with kids where it makes them,
you know,

2029
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:00,790
kids who were really rowdy at calms and 
down.

2030
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:02,530
How the fuck does that work?
I mean,

2031
01:34:02,531 --> 01:34:06,160
there's a bunch of different proposed 
mechanisms that are kind of complicated.

2032
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:09,430
But um,
I don't really know how it works.

2033
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:11,020
That's always been.
I've,

2034
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:15,550
I've met a couple kids that are on 
Ritalin and it's always been a very dark

2035
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:19,630
sort of a moment when you realized that 
these people are drugging their kid,

2036
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:20,700
you know?
Uh,

2037
01:34:20,710 --> 01:34:24,010
I don't know if some people need it,
but I know some people don't need it.

2038
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,650
I've seen some kids that are just a 
little bit rowdy and they need attention

2039
01:34:26,651 --> 01:34:28,990
and not getting it.
Then all of a sudden they're pilled up.

2040
01:34:29,290 --> 01:34:31,030
That's a disturbing thing to watch.
Yeah.

2041
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:36,060
I think it's with.
Especially with very young children 

2042
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:36,060
around high school,
College Age,

2043
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:38,290
and especially when the mom crushed to 
the down.

2044
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:43,291
They snort it like in the wonderful 
whites of West Virginia.

2045
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:47,000
The wild and wonderful wives.
They were snorting pills as after friend

2046
01:34:47,001 --> 01:34:48,910
after she gave birth,
she gave birth.

2047
01:34:48,911 --> 01:34:50,920
She was in the hospital.
Remember that?

2048
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:53,770
Didn't have seen some of this.
Actually.

2049
01:34:53,790 --> 01:34:55,990
It's fucking fabulous.
It's like watching.

2050
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:58,430
If you,
you turned

2051
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:01,280
monkeys loose and let them live amongst 
people.

2052
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:03,020
How they live.
They would live like these people.

2053
01:35:03,021 --> 01:35:05,330
These people are wild.
They're fucking

2054
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:06,650
why y'all?

2055
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:09,200
They're a different breed of human being
here.

2056
01:35:09,201 --> 01:35:12,320
You're in here rattling off all this 
scientific knowledge,

2057
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:17,210
neurochemistry and Pharmacopia and 
there's people that could breed with you

2058
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,380
and they're there.

2059
01:35:18,490 --> 01:35:22,660
My name is access one in the family.

2060
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:28,300
It's amazing.
It's all going on right now at the same 

2061
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:28,300
time.
Oh Man.

2062
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,650
We had a guy on a that was talking to us
about,

2063
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,090
uh,
about hunting.

2064
01:35:32,091 --> 01:35:37,091
His name's Steven Rinella.
Who was on the last podcast and he was 

2065
01:35:37,091 --> 01:35:37,580
telling us about,
he was in Africa and in Africa.

2066
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:42,590
He was hanging out with these people 
that have to hunt for their food every 

2067
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:43,280
single day and he was out to go with 
them,

2068
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:48,350
but they have an internet connection.
They don't really have electricity.

2069
01:35:48,351 --> 01:35:50,900
They have a generator they can turn on 
for like an hour or two at night,

2070
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:53,360
but I can't.
I can't keep it on the can't afford it.

2071
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:58,390
It's hard to get gas out there.
They have arrows and bows and shit 

2072
01:35:58,390 --> 01:36:01,600
they've made themselves and yet they 
check their email and you can friend 

2073
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,620
them on facebook.
That's all going on right now.

2074
01:36:03,621 --> 01:36:05,510
At the same time.
It's amazing.

2075
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:08,690
Yeah.
Do we get you to high before the show?

2076
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:11,500
Be honest because I think I got too 
high.

2077
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:14,030
I was high for a while.
Grandma was.

2078
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:15,740
Well,
it's also I'm,

2079
01:36:15,810 --> 01:36:18,220
I'm so fucked up because I just got back
from Brazil.

2080
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:21,180
Most of my,
my brain is on total auto hotel.

2081
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:23,470
I am one of my babies was throwing up 
last night.

2082
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:26,110
That sucks.
It's sad.

2083
01:36:26,170 --> 01:36:27,070
So sad.
I,

2084
01:36:27,071 --> 01:36:28,070
I fucked up.
I,

2085
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:30,970
I flew southwest,
which you say I love southwest,

2086
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,480
but they have that whole number thing,
like if you check into late you,

2087
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:34,300
you're either a,
b,

2088
01:36:34,301 --> 01:36:39,301
c or d or whatever.
How many people get on the plane first 

2089
01:36:39,301 --> 01:36:40,950
they put the a's on then the bees and I 
did one of those things where you sat.

2090
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:45,710
I sat was Columbus to la?
Well,

2091
01:36:45,730 --> 01:36:50,730
Vegas Still La,
but I sat between two of the fattest 

2092
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:50,730
people ever and I'm sorry,
but um,

2093
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:54,100
they both took up 90 percent of my,
my seat.

2094
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:59,280
So the whole time I'm like,
they were in the middle and the other 

2095
01:36:59,280 --> 01:36:59,280
side,
so it's like a movie.

2096
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:03,510
It was,
but I was holding myself like this and 

2097
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:03,510
you know,
my,

2098
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:05,170
my elbow pain that been in,
I am so jacked from that flight.

2099
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:10,200
That was the closest thing to torture 
I've ever been and I couldn't do 

2100
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:10,750
anything about it.
You can't do well.

2101
01:37:10,751 --> 01:37:12,880
Didn't they kick Kevin Smith off?
Yeah.

2102
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,320
How big were these people?
Pretty big.

2103
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:16,280
Kevin Smith,
the,

2104
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:16,990
the,
the,

2105
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:18,640
the,
the guy was bigger than the girl.

2106
01:37:18,641 --> 01:37:23,641
But the problem was the guy,
he had so much room to lean on the 

2107
01:37:23,641 --> 01:37:27,130
window,
but he decided to lean on my side and so

2108
01:37:27,131 --> 01:37:28,230
the whole time he's like,
oh,

2109
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:33,270
he's on my lap on the east.
And the woman was trying to be a little 

2110
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:34,240
bit nicer about it,
but she was still pretty big.

2111
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:38,800
So she was on my space like our C,
that's a human rights issue.

2112
01:37:39,170 --> 01:37:44,170
It's fucking seats for two goddamn slow.
I need like a rape whistle would slip 

2113
01:37:44,170 --> 01:37:48,571
right in.
You can just go sideways and those 

2114
01:37:49,421 --> 01:37:54,421
families couldn't even touch you.
You'd be like a sheet of paper between 

2115
01:37:54,421 --> 01:37:54,421
pure red rocks.
Yeah.

2116
01:37:54,421 --> 01:37:54,670
Yeah.
I have no problem.

2117
01:37:54,730 --> 01:37:55,920
There should be a whistle for them.

2118
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:58,950
We have an issue with people are getting
too fucking fat,

2119
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:00,750
you know,
and it's been going on for a long time.

2120
01:38:00,751 --> 01:38:05,751
There's a,
there was an image once that I saw 

2121
01:38:05,751 --> 01:38:08,121
online from the early 19 hundreds and it
was one of those carnivals and it was 

2122
01:38:08,121 --> 01:38:12,771
the Batman and the carnival,
like there wouldn't be the guy that was 

2123
01:38:12,771 --> 01:38:13,270
the fat man and he was barely fat.
I mean,

2124
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:15,250
in comparison to what we consider fat 
today,

2125
01:38:15,251 --> 01:38:20,251
like some of these people that you see 
that have to get moved out of their 

2126
01:38:20,251 --> 01:38:22,101
house,
they have to cut a hole out and they're 

2127
01:38:22,101 --> 01:38:22,101
attached to the couch because they 
haven't gotten up.

2128
01:38:22,101 --> 01:38:24,680
They'd been shooting where they sit in 
their fiber,

2129
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:27,660
their skin has like melted into the 
fucking chair.

2130
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,880
This is not just one person.
This is many,

2131
01:38:29,881 --> 01:38:31,320
many,
many people have done this.

2132
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:36,650
It's been a bunch of people that they 
had to cut their fucking house open so 

2133
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:36,780
they could pull them out attached to 
their couch.

2134
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:39,000
You know,
and this was just,

2135
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:40,650
you know,
1,919.

2136
01:38:40,651 --> 01:38:43,830
Oh three or something show fat man.
And he was like barely fat.

2137
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:46,830
It was like barely.
Who was a guy who should go on a diet,

2138
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:50,250
you know,
who was like not,

2139
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:55,560
you know,
Joey Diaz when he was not even at his 

2140
01:38:57,421 --> 01:38:59,400
heaviest,
like halfway there,

2141
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:04,580
halfway between joy.
So it's like that's just a shorter 

2142
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:05,820
amount of time ago where it was really 
rare to get that fat.

2143
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,810
It's amazing.
It's amazing how far society,

2144
01:39:09,811 --> 01:39:14,811
his sled or how far humanity has slayed 
when it comes to that or our bodies are 

2145
01:39:14,811 --> 01:39:19,640
exploding.
Like it's so common to see people just 

2146
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:19,640
overflowing out of their clothes,
you know,

2147
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:22,140
fast food.
It's corn,

2148
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:23,640
it's a lot of it.
Corn Syrup,

2149
01:39:23,641 --> 01:39:27,060
right?
Isn't there a documentary on the corn is

2150
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:29,370
really terrible for your body and 
difficult for it to break down.

2151
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:35,160
That's why they feed it to cows and shit
and get them fattened up before you 

2152
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:35,550
before you slaughter and makes them more
delicious.

2153
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:37,460
Yeah.
I don't know.

2154
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:41,190
You should be diet drugs from easier to 
obtain as well.

2155
01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:42,870
Oh really?
Yeah,

2156
01:39:42,871 --> 01:39:44,310
definitely.
So you think when.

2157
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:45,780
Well,
I know one girl I saw,

2158
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,700
I saw one girl lose a shitload of 
weight.

2159
01:39:47,701 --> 01:39:49,110
She lost like 50,
60 pounds.

2160
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:51,900
She went from being kind of Chubby to 
like really hot and it was like whoa.

2161
01:39:51,901 --> 01:39:56,901
And it happened so quickly and she was 
on something called Phen Phen you 

2162
01:39:56,901 --> 01:39:56,901
remember that?
Yeah.

2163
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:02,440
That stuff Jachter though.
It just totally short circuited.

2164
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:06,090
Are cardiotoxic dangerous.
It's crazy.

2165
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:11,140
Yeah.
So she went right back to her normal 

2166
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:11,140
weight again.
It was like she was a hot chick for like

2167
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:13,080
a year,
that phen phen kept it rock and for like

2168
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,160
a year,
but it was just too,

2169
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:15,570
too nutty,
you know,

2170
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:19,590
the store with them was to every 
stimulant they've used as a diet drug.

2171
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:24,590
These teas,
methamphetamine used instead of me and 

2172
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:24,590
they used 10 metres,
the views,

2173
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:29,060
anything you can imagine,
any stimulant and just anything that 

2174
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:29,910
they could sell you to make.
We're going to loose the stimulants,

2175
01:40:29,911 --> 01:40:31,950
do work and fen phen worked,
I'm sure.

2176
01:40:31,951 --> 01:40:35,380
And do those things that you see like,
you know,

2177
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:37,390
ripped fuel and all that shit or they 
are,

2178
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:40,580
those are those diet pills or those 
things affect it?

2179
01:40:40,590 --> 01:40:41,990
I don't know what's in them.
I mean if there are,

2180
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:44,590
some of them have weird derivatives of 
finesse,

2181
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,080
Colombian,
you know?

2182
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:47,670
Yeah.
What does all that stuff?

2183
01:40:47,671 --> 01:40:49,260
This was just amino acids.
Is that what it is?

2184
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:54,690
No,
they're just probably really weak 

2185
01:40:54,690 --> 01:40:54,690
stimulant.

2186
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:59,770
Like thin ethylamine is a close 
derivative of amphetamine,

2187
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:03,580
just missing one carbon atom and uh,
and it's illegal.

2188
01:41:03,581 --> 01:41:08,581
So you can just put tons of it into 
dietary supplements and it produces a 

2189
01:41:08,581 --> 01:41:09,880
short lasting stimulant effect.

2190
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:16,410
It's amazing that that's one of the 
number one concerns that people have 

2191
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:19,120
getting rid of fat.
So it's it.

2192
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:24,170
It's a very strange statement when you 
think about how society becomes so 

2193
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:27,160
successful that even when people are 
down in the dumps,

2194
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:30,160
they're still fat.
There's still fucking.

2195
01:41:30,370 --> 01:41:34,630
It's like normal.
It's normal to have excess energy stored

2196
01:41:34,631 --> 01:41:37,450
away onto your skin.
It's normally to be prepared for,

2197
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:40,390
for your fucking stocked up,
you know,

2198
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:41,470
in,
in the,

2199
01:41:41,471 --> 01:41:43,540
the wild days.
So rare to,

2200
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,640
to become a fat person,
you know,

2201
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:51,660
so fucking terrible conversation.
You guys checked out a long time ago.

2202
01:41:52,751 --> 01:41:57,310
I smelled it.
All this talk about fat.

2203
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:01,510
You know when you have friends that are 
overweight and you worry,

2204
01:42:01,511 --> 01:42:02,650
you know,
after patrice died,

2205
01:42:02,651 --> 01:42:06,120
especially our friend Patrice O'Neal's,
a standup comedian just recently.

2206
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:08,350
You know,
you have friends that are overweight and

2207
01:42:08,351 --> 01:42:11,800
it's just,
it's like a bomb and you know it's going

2208
01:42:11,801 --> 01:42:14,410
to go off eventually.
You don't know what you can do.

2209
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:19,530
You've got to try to diffuse it.
You try to lead them in the right 

2210
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:20,050
direction or enjoy them until they blow 
up.

2211
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:24,680
Patrice o'neal think that is fatness 
aided his comedy as well.

2212
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:28,140
I've never had that conversation with 
them so I could never speak of it,

2213
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:33,180
but he's.
He was really analytical about his 

2214
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:35,911
comedy.
I just think he was also a guy who 

2215
01:42:35,911 --> 01:42:36,280
wanted to do whatever the fuck you want 
her to do right then and there.

2216
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:40,600
Some of the best comedians are also very
impulsive people and you know,

2217
01:42:40,601 --> 01:42:45,601
it can be good and bad.
I know comedians will become impulsive 

2218
01:42:45,601 --> 01:42:48,900
gamblers and they get addicted to drugs,
so like a lot of them have really kind 

2219
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:51,790
of wild and impulsive instincts and 
that's what makes him funny.

2220
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:53,890
That be the first person to say,
bitch,

2221
01:42:53,891 --> 01:42:56,350
shut the fuck up.
And that was patrice o'neil.

2222
01:42:56,351 --> 01:42:58,990
He was the first guy that would say he 
call you on your bullshit.

2223
01:42:59,230 --> 01:43:04,230
The first guy to say,
shut the fuck up and to be that person 

2224
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:07,291
that doesn't really like worry about how
this is going to come out and just fly 

2225
01:43:07,291 --> 01:43:07,291
with it.

2226
01:43:07,291 --> 01:43:09,970
It's like it's a very specific type of 
personality.

2227
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:13,810
Not that many people do it and they,
that personality is prone to doing a lot

2228
01:43:13,811 --> 01:43:15,750
of other crazy shit to that,
that personality,

2229
01:43:15,770 --> 01:43:18,400
personalities prone to just eat until 
they're fucking pass out.

2230
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:22,900
A personality is prone to do 15 shots 
and you know on a dare.

2231
01:43:22,901 --> 01:43:25,240
That's a wild personality.
That's a personality.

2232
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:27,160
It's going to go with you to Mexico.
You know,

2233
01:43:27,161 --> 01:43:29,020
it's like that.
That's the reason why they're funny.

2234
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:32,140
So it becomes a.
you're sad.

2235
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:37,170
Like you see your friend who's really 
big and you see them eating themselves 

2236
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:37,270
to death and you're like,
oh shit,

2237
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:38,240
what the fuck?
And I said,

2238
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:43,260
you can't say anything.
There's nothing you can do anymore than 

2239
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:43,260
you've already done.
You're an asshole.

2240
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:44,350
You tell them you love them.
Give them a pat on the back.

2241
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:45,700
If you need help,
come to the gym.

2242
01:43:45,701 --> 01:43:47,980
I work out with you.
But other than that,

2243
01:43:47,981 --> 01:43:50,380
what the fuck else can you do?
It's a weird world.

2244
01:43:50,381 --> 01:43:51,980
We live in people eating themselves to

2245
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,290
death.
Hamilton Morris.

2246
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:59,291
You don't have to worry about that shit.
You stay slender with the vegetarian 

2247
01:43:59,291 --> 01:44:02,531
lifestyle on your bare basic alanines,
whatever various substances you choose.

2248
01:44:03,790 --> 01:44:04,300
Do you,
do you.

2249
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:06,950
Are you a multivitamin guy?
You seem like you know so much about the

2250
01:44:06,951 --> 01:44:07,670
body.
Do you,

2251
01:44:07,930 --> 01:44:10,710
do you take supplements?
I take,

2252
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:14,780
I take lists that you do.
I knew you motherfucker.

2253
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:20,650
You're concerned about your liver.
It depends on what supplement.

2254
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:24,410
Not all of them have hepatic toxicity 
issues,

2255
01:44:24,411 --> 01:44:29,411
but some of them do you handle taxes?
This is just about not like,

2256
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:32,780
it's inherently bad for your liver to 
take vitamins,

2257
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:34,220
but uh,
it's part of food,

2258
01:44:34,221 --> 01:44:35,480
right?
I mean that's essentially what I mean.

2259
01:44:35,481 --> 01:44:37,120
Everything has to go through your liver 
so they don't,

2260
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:41,890
that's not a huge worry unless it's 
something or some in super high doses of

2261
01:44:41,891 --> 01:44:46,891
toxic.
Like what are the ones who was the 

2262
01:44:46,891 --> 01:44:46,891
lawyer?

2263
01:44:46,891 --> 01:44:49,180
Soluble ones are,
are like vitamin e potentially vitamin A

2264
01:44:51,021 --> 01:44:52,250
as well.
I don't know.

2265
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:54,710
It's not something I've done a huge 
amount of research on,

2266
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:59,740
but now when you say fat soluble,
if somebody said that once for someone 

2267
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:03,800
who got caught taking a performance 
enhancing drug and one of the the people

2268
01:45:03,801 --> 01:45:08,801
that was in his camp said one of the 
things that fucked him up was that he's 

2269
01:45:08,801 --> 01:45:11,270
too fat and so he can't get it out of 
his system as quick short.

2270
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:13,130
Is that really true?
Like it stays in your fat,

2271
01:45:13,131 --> 01:45:15,800
like if you are a lean person,
you would get it out of your system.

2272
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:18,950
Whereas if you were a person that had a 
high percentage of body weight,

2273
01:45:18,951 --> 01:45:21,380
it would remain for longer.
It's possible.

2274
01:45:21,381 --> 01:45:26,381
Yeah.
I mean that's one of the main physical 

2275
01:45:26,381 --> 01:45:28,871
properties of any molecule is that it 
has different abilities and different 

2276
01:45:28,871 --> 01:45:32,351
chemicals and some things are lipid 
soluble and and if it's something like 

2277
01:45:32,351 --> 01:45:36,401
thc and you have a huge amount of fat 
tissue on your body that the thc can 

2278
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:41,240
stay in so you just fucking high all 
day.

2279
01:45:41,870 --> 01:45:44,300
Certain people,
you're not getting high off of it.

2280
01:45:44,301 --> 01:45:49,301
It's just just in hearing and yourself.
It's not doing anything unless it's in 

2281
01:45:49,301 --> 01:45:51,290
the central nervous,
just giving you a very mild high,

2282
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:56,310
just in my mildest,
just cooks in Lindsay's point where it 

2283
01:45:56,310 --> 01:46:00,630
the claim that there's like some 
reservoir in your spinal fluid or 

2284
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:01,250
something and if you crack your back the
right way,

2285
01:46:01,251 --> 01:46:06,251
that all really blast of cannabinoids or
Lsd or something really.

2286
01:46:07,190 --> 01:46:08,480
Wow.
People would say that.

2287
01:46:08,481 --> 01:46:09,710
I don't think it's true.
Well,

2288
01:46:09,711 --> 01:46:14,711
there's people that say that Kundalini 
Yoga practice can lead to psychedelic 

2289
01:46:14,711 --> 01:46:14,711
experiences.
Sure.

2290
01:46:14,711 --> 01:46:16,100
Yeah.
Have you ever experienced that?

2291
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:21,140
Yeah.
I studied Kundalini Yoga for a while 

2292
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:21,320
during the trip.
No,

2293
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:26,410
no try.
I mean that was one of the ways they 

2294
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:29,261
tried to sell.
I had to take it as part of my sport's 

2295
01:46:29,261 --> 01:46:30,420
requirement in high school and Sports.
That's awesome.

2296
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:34,340
That is awesome.
Holy Shit.

2297
01:46:34,341 --> 01:46:35,860
That's amazing.
Yeah,

2298
01:46:36,050 --> 01:46:37,600
that's great.
Yeah.

2299
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:43,050
And they tried to sell it by equating it
with a drug experience of some kind and 

2300
01:46:43,581 --> 01:46:45,830
that's why it was so popular in the 
sixties for that same reason,

2301
01:46:45,831 --> 01:46:50,160
but I don't really.
I never achieved any

2302
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:53,160
profound state of altered consciousness.

2303
01:46:53,890 --> 01:46:55,750
One friend who,
uh,

2304
01:46:55,780 --> 01:46:58,450
had a,
a girl that he knew that was a friend of

2305
01:46:58,451 --> 01:47:03,451
his,
that he actually went on a trip with 

2306
01:47:03,451 --> 01:47:05,401
her.
They were actually just platonic 

2307
01:47:05,401 --> 01:47:05,401
friends,
but they would,

2308
01:47:05,401 --> 01:47:08,101
uh,
traveled together occasionally and she 

2309
01:47:08,101 --> 01:47:10,381
was into like serious Kundalini Yoga 
where she would get up every morning at 

2310
01:47:10,571 --> 01:47:14,470
a very specific time and she would have 
to face a very specific angle.

2311
01:47:14,471 --> 01:47:17,550
I don't remember what it was,
was towards the Sun or away from the sun

2312
01:47:17,551 --> 01:47:22,551
and I don't know what she was doing,
but she would do these very intense 

2313
01:47:22,551 --> 01:47:25,720
Kundalini exercises for like an hour,
an hour and 15 minutes,

2314
01:47:25,721 --> 01:47:28,600
an hour and 20 minutes.
And she did it every day and she claimed

2315
01:47:28,780 --> 01:47:30,850
that when she did it for long periods of
time,

2316
01:47:30,851 --> 01:47:35,851
because she did it so much,
she could get into like an astral 

2317
01:47:35,851 --> 01:47:39,691
traveling sort of dimension,
a traveling state of consciousness where

2318
01:47:40,061 --> 01:47:41,650
she would have psychedelic experiences.

2319
01:47:41,710 --> 01:47:42,310
Yeah.
Actually,

2320
01:47:42,311 --> 01:47:43,990
now that I think of it,
I did have some.

2321
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:48,220
You just forget that they weren't 
exactly the same.

2322
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:49,140
I wouldn't.
You've had,

2323
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:52,480
you've had so many psychedelic 
experiences for you to have one in Yogi,

2324
01:47:52,481 --> 01:47:53,080
like,
oh yeah,

2325
01:47:53,081 --> 01:47:54,610
I have one in that too,
but it wasn't really,

2326
01:47:54,850 --> 01:47:56,340
it was like a,
you know,

2327
01:47:56,350 --> 01:47:57,880
they,
they didn't use breathing techniques,

2328
01:47:57,881 --> 01:48:02,881
breath of fire,
and for a normal person having an 

2329
01:48:02,881 --> 01:48:02,881
experience like that would be something 
they would never forget.

2330
01:48:02,881 --> 01:48:07,800
Oh my God,
did yoga and I had this most incredible 

2331
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:07,800
transcendent experience.
I left my body,

2332
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:08,830
I became one with the universe for you.
You're like,

2333
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:10,780
Oh yeah,
I did that during yoga too.

2334
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:14,830
So how did it happen?
How did that go down?

2335
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:20,170
You know,
you have to follow these different 

2336
01:48:20,170 --> 01:48:21,361
breathing techniques and then hold 
yourself in some kind of a weird stress 

2337
01:48:21,361 --> 01:48:23,180
position that's extremely exhausting.
And then your,

2338
01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:28,260
all of your muscles start to vibrate.
Like I was on that machine of the turbo 

2339
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:28,260
sonic.
Yeah,

2340
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:31,920
like the Turbo Sonic.
So it's like a turbo sonic type effect.

2341
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:36,930
I would say.
I would compare it more to the turbo 

2342
01:48:36,930 --> 01:48:36,930
sonic then to Lsd.
Wow,

2343
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:38,290
that's interesting.
Yeah.

2344
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:43,610
What's the number one thing that if you 
had to do it again,

2345
01:48:43,621 --> 01:48:45,810
you would approach with more caution?
Is there any.

2346
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:49,290
Is there any one psychedelic experience 
for a loop?

2347
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:50,610
I mean,
yeah,

2348
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:55,740
many have,
but I think drugs like there certainly 

2349
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:57,910
are drugs that are more friendly than 
others and I think five immuno dmt would

2350
01:48:57,911 --> 01:49:02,911
be an example of something that has the 
capacity to be extremely unpleasant if 

2351
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:04,690
you take it under the wrong 
circumstances.

2352
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:08,370
I had a friend completely flip out 
taking it because he had.

2353
01:49:08,371 --> 01:49:13,371
He had eaten and so he had to throw up 
and he got up to throw up and he got to 

2354
01:49:13,371 --> 01:49:17,180
the sink just in time to throw up,
but then he was just going crazy.

2355
01:49:17,930 --> 01:49:21,630
You're talking about rape,
talking about all kinds of crazy shit.

2356
01:49:21,631 --> 01:49:22,590
Took his shirt off.

2357
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:27,880
Yeah.
I had a friend lose consciousness and 

2358
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:28,100
started vomiting and look as if they had
died.

2359
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:29,690
I've seen.
I had a friend read them.

2360
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:32,180
My friend Doug Stanhope comedian.
I thought we'd lost him.

2361
01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:37,570
It was going like this and little 
bubbles were coming out of the corner of

2362
01:49:40,571 --> 01:49:41,860
his mouth and I'm like,
Shit.

2363
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:47,640
And I'm hanging out with Doug and I'm 
just thinking of all the chemicals that 

2364
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:48,430
doug throws into his body,
cigarettes and beer

2365
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:52,540
and fucking mean.
Doug's shits on multivitamins.

2366
01:49:52,541 --> 01:49:54,520
He's not taking a multivitamin fuck out 
of here.

2367
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:59,660
So I'm like,
we might have red lined his body with 

2368
01:49:59,660 --> 01:49:59,660
this shit.
I was like,

2369
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:00,040
he just took a big hit and he's.
He might,

2370
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:02,530
he might be a goner,
but he came through it,

2371
01:50:02,531 --> 01:50:04,450
but it was terrifying for a couple of 
minutes.

2372
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:06,070
You did map them out then?
Yeah,

2373
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:09,860
almost done,
man.

2374
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:10,780
I'm,
I'm okay.

2375
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:19,810
What were you saying about that?
Just that you were asking me if there's 

2376
01:50:19,810 --> 01:50:22,020
one that I would approach with caution 
again in the mail you think would be the

2377
01:50:22,330 --> 01:50:27,330
scariest one probably.
I mean there's also just isolated 

2378
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:31,921
experiences that you can't necessarily 
connect with the substance p called 

2379
01:50:31,921 --> 01:50:35,770
there's like an shogun takes this 
oxygen,

2380
01:50:35,771 --> 01:50:40,771
less masculine derivative called 
isocracy and goes into a fugue state 

2381
01:50:40,781 --> 01:50:45,781
where she has a prevailing sense of 
unreality that lasts for months or 

2382
01:50:45,781 --> 01:50:46,150
something.

2383
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:48,550
It just totally feels like she's in a 
dream.

2384
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:53,730
But then I've had friends who also have 
used unusual substances that have been 

2385
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:55,960
tested very much and have weird 
reactions,

2386
01:50:55,961 --> 01:51:00,961
but every,
even if you ingest the same substance 

2387
01:51:00,961 --> 01:51:03,451
over and over and over again,
you really don't know exactly what's 

2388
01:51:03,451 --> 01:51:06,751
going to happen with the psychedelics.
You taking the exact same quantity of 

2389
01:51:06,751 --> 01:51:08,770
synthetic suicide and over and over and 
over again a year apart.

2390
01:51:08,771 --> 01:51:10,690
Every year will feel completely 
different every time.

2391
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:15,550
So I'm always skeptical of people that 
deals if they really know the effects of

2392
01:51:15,551 --> 01:51:18,130
any substance because you always 
completely different.

2393
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:23,280
Well,
dmt always seemed like there's so much 

2394
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:23,770
coming at you and there was coming at 
you from like 15 minutes.

2395
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:26,200
Like it was almost impossible to bring 
back anything.

2396
01:51:26,201 --> 01:51:28,330
It was almost impossible to record any 
of it.

2397
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:29,530
Yeah.
You know,

2398
01:51:29,531 --> 01:51:31,420
I mean to say that you know,
that experience,

2399
01:51:31,421 --> 01:51:33,340
my God,
you'd have to do that experience so many

2400
01:51:33,341 --> 01:51:38,341
times just to get a general sense of 
just looking around and just relaxing 

2401
01:51:38,341 --> 01:51:39,070
and trying to absorb it all.

2402
01:51:39,070 --> 01:51:40,870
Trying to like figure out what the fuck 
is this?

2403
01:51:40,990 --> 01:51:43,150
Can I move this around myself?
Like what is this?

2404
01:51:43,151 --> 01:51:44,830
Is this,
is this an organism?

2405
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:46,420
Is this,
is this the universe?

2406
01:51:46,421 --> 01:51:49,780
Is this the wiring of love?
What the fuck is going on here?

2407
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:54,930
It takes so long like you do it and 
every time you do it you come back and 

2408
01:51:54,930 --> 01:51:54,930
then you go,
what the fuck was that?

2409
01:51:54,930 --> 01:51:57,790
And then you go back in again and it's 
still the same thing for 15 minutes.

2410
01:51:57,791 --> 01:52:00,160
It's just like it's too alien and too 
crazy.

2411
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:02,730
There's no way you can have a really 
truly get a grip on it.

2412
01:52:02,731 --> 01:52:05,860
It's not like you can go on a vacation 
to dmt land,

2413
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,930
you know,
if you could take a trip,

2414
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:13,460
you know you could go somewhere for two 
weeks and in that two week time you 

2415
01:52:13,781 --> 01:52:16,630
would see the entire time you will be 
going through a dmt trip.

2416
01:52:17,030 --> 01:52:22,030
Right.
Then maybe you would kind of get a grip 

2417
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:24,751
on the IOWASCA is some intermediate 
between smoking dmt and a non 

2418
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:30,900
intermediate.
It's just the longest that you can have 

2419
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:31,780
that experience and even then you don't 
really.

2420
01:52:31,790 --> 01:52:36,790
It's not it lengthening the experience.
It gives you some greater understanding 

2421
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:41,011
of what it is necessarily.
I don't think it's really any less or 

2422
01:52:41,011 --> 01:52:42,580
more confusing than smoking it.
It's just a longer duration.

2423
01:52:42,581 --> 01:52:43,660
And even then you have people like 
Gordon,

2424
01:52:43,661 --> 01:52:46,010
todd skinner,
who are opening themselves up

2425
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,110
to ivy bags filled with dmt.

2426
01:52:48,730 --> 01:52:53,730
No,
this is the guy that you wrote about in 

2427
01:52:53,730 --> 01:52:53,730
the what,
what is it called?

2428
01:52:53,730 --> 01:52:53,730
Crystal.
What?

2429
01:52:53,730 --> 01:52:53,730
What is this?
They'll call,

2430
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:57,120
but your.
Your article was called high on crystal.

2431
01:52:57,660 --> 01:53:01,230
Crystal is what?
A fucking crazy story.

2432
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:04,530
If you haven't read that.
This is a must read the other one.

2433
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:07,200
The other thing we were,
you were interviewing shogun was amazing

2434
01:53:07,201 --> 01:53:08,820
as well,
but you have to see this.

2435
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:14,930
This girl was a stripper and she meets 
this dude who's like this big time lsd 

2436
01:53:16,140 --> 01:53:21,140
manufacturer who has a fucking house in 
a silo and millions of dollars,

2437
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:26,600
right?
He's rich as fuck and he's like the 

2438
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:26,600
number one lsd guy in the country

2439
01:53:26,710 --> 01:53:31,710
or so.
I mean it's also unclear is another 

2440
01:53:31,710 --> 01:53:32,500
example of a story where a lot of people
talk about it with an enormous amount of

2441
01:53:32,501 --> 01:53:35,500
confidence is if they have no 
understanding of what happened and say,

2442
01:53:35,501 --> 01:53:37,120
oh,
it's all crystal Coles folder.

2443
01:53:37,121 --> 01:53:42,121
It's all x's falter wise,
but if I've learned anything from 

2444
01:53:42,121 --> 01:53:45,480
researching it over the course of years,
it said absolutely nothing is certain 

2445
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:48,511
about the story.
It's incredibly complicated and there's 

2446
01:53:48,511 --> 01:53:51,541
so much conflicting information for 
absolutely every element of the story 

2447
01:53:51,541 --> 01:53:55,780
that you have to be very careful about 
talking about what happened with 

2448
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:58,320
certainty.
But there was this lab and uh,

2449
01:53:58,321 --> 01:54:02,350
and they did crystal coal into it and 
she did become a part of it.

2450
01:54:05,070 --> 01:54:07,680
She took down the dude.
Yes.

2451
01:54:07,860 --> 01:54:11,370
That's amazing what everyone was crazy 
girl.

2452
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:13,880
Shamana Kalanick.
Woo.

2453
01:54:13,950 --> 01:54:15,600
It's just hundred that she did it.
Yeah.

2454
01:54:15,601 --> 01:54:19,920
It's way harder than she did.
I and stuck it up his ass.

2455
01:54:19,921 --> 01:54:21,460
I don't even care about that.
Why did it,

2456
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:25,500
how to amazing story though,
man.

2457
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:26,160
This,
this,

2458
01:54:26,161 --> 01:54:28,890
uh,
this girl escaped,

2459
01:54:28,891 --> 01:54:33,891
right?
And then the dude came after and 

2460
01:54:33,891 --> 01:54:36,530
kidnapped her and some other dude,
they escaped together to get away from 

2461
01:54:36,530 --> 01:54:40,401
this fucking crazy guy and it turns out 
the guy was working with the FBI or the 

2462
01:54:40,401 --> 01:54:41,370
Dea.
So there's number one,

2463
01:54:41,371 --> 01:54:45,930
lsd dealers working with the dea and had
been for quite some time.

2464
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:47,940
Yeah.
You know,

2465
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:50,960
that reminds me of a story.
Do you know who Whitey Bulger is?

2466
01:54:50,970 --> 01:54:52,950
Yes.
You know that store then from acid?

2467
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:53,430
Yes.
Right.

2468
01:54:53,431 --> 01:54:55,260
You're from Massachusetts.
What an amazing story.

2469
01:54:55,261 --> 01:55:00,261
For people that don't know,
Whitey bulger was the head of the Irish 

2470
01:55:00,261 --> 01:55:02,901
mob and he was also working for the FBI,
so if you turned Whitey bulger in Whitey

2471
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:05,760
bulger would know from the FBI,
first of all,

2472
01:55:05,761 --> 01:55:10,761
they wouldn't arrest him and then he 
would kill you and that's really how it 

2473
01:55:10,761 --> 01:55:10,761
ran.
I mean,

2474
01:55:10,761 --> 01:55:12,780
they really did run it like that and you
find that out and you go,

2475
01:55:12,810 --> 01:55:16,560
that is amazing.
This is essentially along the same lines

2476
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:17,910
and things like

2477
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:21,690
it's been happening for a long time,
both in the US and internationally.

2478
01:55:22,210 --> 01:55:27,210
You know,
there's the Iran Contra is with this 

2479
01:55:27,210 --> 01:55:30,561
whole scandal about them pumping cocaine
into ghettos in America to create the 

2480
01:55:30,691 --> 01:55:33,330
crack problem.
I don't know that it's necessarily true,

2481
01:55:33,331 --> 01:55:38,331
but it's a theory that a lot of people 
have and the same thing happened in 

2482
01:55:38,331 --> 01:55:38,910
South Africa with with methaqualone,
with quaaludes.

2483
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:44,090
There was this whole project called 
project coast where they were 

2484
01:55:44,090 --> 01:55:47,390
synthesizing massive quantities of Mgma 
and quail ludes in order to weaponize 

2485
01:55:47,881 --> 01:55:52,881
them for crowd control.
Supposedly they were pumping them all 

2486
01:55:52,881 --> 01:55:55,020
into the streets and now the ultimate 
MTMA weapons is a crowd control.

2487
01:55:55,140 --> 01:56:00,140
Oh my God.
So you would blast the crowd with 

2488
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:00,140
ecstasy.
Yeah,

2489
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:00,210
it's called project coast.
What a brilliant idea.

2490
01:56:00,270 --> 01:56:03,840
Where do I sign up?
That's my bit about how to calm down the

2491
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:04,230
Middle East.
I had a bit.

2492
01:56:04,231 --> 01:56:09,231
I did about sending crop duster planes 
just fucking cover the Middle East with 

2493
01:56:09,231 --> 01:56:10,320
chronic smoke for just weeks.

2494
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:15,120
And then they did that as well.
Actually weaponized thc.

2495
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:20,180
They did at at that.
That's the craziest James Gyms.

2496
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:24,060
There's a crazy sentence ever.
Weaponized Tac.

2497
01:56:24,450 --> 01:56:26,280
They called it like red oil or 
something.

2498
01:56:26,281 --> 01:56:30,180
That was like the code name for it.
What does it do?

2499
01:56:30,181 --> 01:56:31,530
You spray it on people and they become 
high.

2500
01:56:31,531 --> 01:56:32,340
Yeah,
exactly.

2501
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:34,020
That's hilarious.
Edgewood arsenal,

2502
01:56:34,021 --> 01:56:35,570
that's the name of it.
Uh,

2503
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,800
yeah,
it probably,

2504
01:56:37,801 --> 01:56:42,801
I mean that was the,
it was not a visit improvement because 

2505
01:56:42,801 --> 01:56:44,450
it's a nonlethal incapacitating agent 
and you know,

2506
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:48,600
if you have a choice between shooting 
someone and dusting them with Thc,

2507
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:51,540
dad's amazing.
I can't believe that was a real product.

2508
01:56:51,690 --> 01:56:52,650
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2509
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:57,390
What else can they trust you with MDM 
TAC and they try LSD as well.

2510
01:56:57,391 --> 01:57:02,391
I mean the problem is also that the 
physical properties of these different 

2511
01:57:02,391 --> 01:57:05,241
drugs that limit their,
their ability to travel through the air 

2512
01:57:05,241 --> 01:57:09,090
to maintain their potency when they're 
laid on surfaces around the soil.

2513
01:57:09,090 --> 01:57:12,330
LSD is pretty,
it's not a stable molecule.

2514
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:13,680
So when they were trying to weaponize 
it,

2515
01:57:13,681 --> 01:57:14,750
one of the problems,
it's just,

2516
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:18,540
it didn't aerosolized well it didn't 
last on service as well.

2517
01:57:18,541 --> 01:57:22,680
And then they settled on bz because they
thought it was a better chemical weapon.

2518
01:57:23,190 --> 01:57:28,020
Bz what is bz?
It's a anticholinergic drug like Jacob's

2519
01:57:28,021 --> 01:57:30,720
ladder.
The movie Jacob's ladder is really?

2520
01:57:30,721 --> 01:57:35,721
Yeah.
So they really were trying to make lsd 

2521
01:57:35,721 --> 01:57:35,721
and use it as a weapon.
Absolutely.

2522
01:57:35,820 --> 01:57:36,990
What was the idea that,
well,

2523
01:57:36,991 --> 01:57:41,991
what was it going to do to the troops?
Just to make them disoriented and you 

2524
01:57:41,991 --> 01:57:41,991
just take them.
Well,

2525
01:57:41,991 --> 01:57:41,991
yeah.
I mean,

2526
01:57:41,991 --> 01:57:46,011
can you imagine if you discovered,
if you didn't know anything about 

2527
01:57:46,011 --> 01:57:46,440
psychedelics at all and discovered LSD 
and they.

2528
01:57:46,510 --> 01:57:48,090
They tried absolutely everything they 
could with it.

2529
01:57:48,091 --> 01:57:50,220
They tried to see if they could use it 
as a truth serum.

2530
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:53,220
They tried to see if they could use it 
too.

2531
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:59,150
They tried to both good and bad uses.
There were scientists using it to 

2532
01:57:59,150 --> 01:58:03,080
increase their intelligence and then 
there were people trying to get use it 

2533
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:04,500
as to make people insane,
to reprogram people's brains.

2534
01:58:04,501 --> 01:58:07,440
That was the large part of the MK Ultra 
was about,

2535
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:13,580
you know,
manipulating people's minds using 

2536
01:58:13,580 --> 01:58:13,580
psychedelics and sensory deprivation and
things like that.

2537
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:17,760
And it was just crazy trial and error by
murderers.

2538
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:21,900
That's how they did it.
Trial and error by Nixon's people.

2539
01:58:21,930 --> 01:58:24,270
They should make it into a steam ship.
Imagine man,

2540
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:29,630
trial and error with Lsd by Nixon's 
people and supposedly the word trip 

2541
01:58:29,630 --> 01:58:33,980
comes from.
That's like FBI lingo from when they 

2542
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:34,680
were doing the experiments.
Wow.

2543
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:39,740
The scariest thing that I've ever heard 
connected to any psychedelic 

2544
01:58:39,740 --> 01:58:42,501
experiences.
That was that Timothy leary was 

2545
01:58:42,501 --> 01:58:42,501
connected or not Timothy,
I'm

2546
01:58:42,730 --> 01:58:47,730
the unit Barbara.
Ted Kaczynski was connected to a some 

2547
01:58:47,730 --> 01:58:51,511
studies at Harvard and he had done like 
some classified lsd studies and they,

2548
01:58:52,450 --> 01:58:53,320
you know,
they,

2549
01:58:53,321 --> 01:58:55,300
they tweaked a lot of people's fucking 
hands.

2550
01:58:55,560 --> 01:59:00,560
Then he went back to Berkeley.
I taught math for a few years till he 

2551
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,421
got enough money to buy that cabin,
take on the technology they might have 

2552
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:05,100
fried that dude's brain.
Oh No.

2553
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:08,610
They were love automizing people and 
they were doing just unbelievable.

2554
01:59:08,860 --> 01:59:10,770
And if you're familiar with the book 
acid dreams we had,

2555
01:59:10,771 --> 01:59:14,600
they did every imaginable thing.
Hookup people to ids with stimulant,

2556
01:59:14,601 --> 01:59:19,601
like amphetamine in one wrist,
and you're the second person in a week 

2557
01:59:19,601 --> 01:59:20,680
that's direct recommended acid dreams.
I'd have to go get that now.

2558
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:25,960
Let's read the first half of it.
So it's all about mk ultra different 

2559
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:29,851
experiences that they tried to important
people with lsd and it's about.

2560
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:30,570
Yeah,
all,

2561
01:59:30,620 --> 01:59:33,760
all of these attempts to weaponize LSD 
and to use it as a truth.

2562
01:59:33,761 --> 01:59:38,761
Sarah and mk ultra buying it right now.
You know,

2563
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:42,850
it's an old book.
It's been around since the eighties.

2564
01:59:43,690 --> 01:59:44,480
You've heard of,
uh,

2565
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:45,410
there was,
uh,

2566
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:49,790
it's supposedly an urban myth,
but a French town that they dosed.

2567
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,150
Absolutely true.
It is true.

2568
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:53,180
So they do.
That's true.

2569
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:59,140
And that's more recent research that 
came up in the last maybe in the last 

2570
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:03,001
five years I had read it and then I had 
read a counterpoint that said it was 

2571
02:00:03,001 --> 02:00:05,650
bullshit because you can't even get acid
to work in bread like that,

2572
02:00:05,651 --> 02:00:07,780
that they wouldn't maintain itself.
Is that true?

2573
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:08,830
Yeah,
it wouldn't,

2574
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:13,860
it would not survive the heating,
but they could've added it afterwards 

2575
02:00:13,860 --> 02:00:14,380
and they supposedly they,
I mean,

2576
02:00:14,381 --> 02:00:15,080
you know.
Sure.

2577
02:00:15,081 --> 02:00:16,360
So when they have to be,
I mean,

2578
02:00:16,361 --> 02:00:19,360
how would you go about getting that acid
into the bread?

2579
02:00:19,810 --> 02:00:24,810
You'd have to get a CIA guy who works 
there and just just fucks with 

2580
02:00:24,810 --> 02:00:24,810
everybody's bread and squirts it out.
Go ahead eat that.

2581
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:26,540
I guess so.
I mean,

2582
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,300
you could spray Brad with LSD.
Yeah.

2583
02:00:28,301 --> 02:00:30,070
It was just,
it was an interesting argument when I,

2584
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:32,020
when I heard,
because I had to assume that it was true

2585
02:00:32,021 --> 02:00:33,340
and I was like saying like,
wow,

2586
02:00:33,341 --> 02:00:38,341
look what they found,
and then I saw this counter point to it 

2587
02:00:38,341 --> 02:00:38,341
and I was like,
oh,

2588
02:00:38,341 --> 02:00:38,341
okay.
Is it possible that they have,

2589
02:00:38,341 --> 02:00:43,020
could have created a more stable form of
LSD or could it be some other 

2590
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:44,680
psychedelic that would have similar 
effects that would be stable?

2591
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,450
Sure.
Yeah,

2592
02:00:45,700 --> 02:00:46,620
absolutely.
I mean there's,

2593
02:00:46,650 --> 02:00:51,650
there's plenty of psychedelics that they
were testing at that time that are more 

2594
02:00:51,650 --> 02:00:54,350
stable than LSD.
LSD is unusually in stable,

2595
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:58,780
but uh,
but yeah,

2596
02:00:58,781 --> 02:01:03,781
I think the,
I think that they recovered some 

2597
02:01:03,781 --> 02:01:03,781
communication between two operatives and
I said like,

2598
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:07,240
did you finish the mission with the 
diastal I it or something.

2599
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:11,620
You didn't specifically say Lsd,
but they used some abbreviated form.

2600
02:01:11,621 --> 02:01:14,980
So it's not conclusive,
but I think that there's strong evidence

2601
02:01:14,981 --> 02:01:19,981
that that happened.
You would think that if they knew of 

2602
02:01:19,981 --> 02:01:23,330
that it would have monstrous effects.
They would have to know whether or not 

2603
02:01:23,330 --> 02:01:24,270
there's something that they can 
monetarily.

2604
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:25,020
Well,
I think they did that.

2605
02:01:25,270 --> 02:01:26,470
They want it,
they wanted,

2606
02:01:26,570 --> 02:01:31,570
they wanted to happen,
but it seems like such a powerful thing 

2607
02:01:31,570 --> 02:01:34,621
to have.
You're going to find out what it's 

2608
02:01:34,621 --> 02:01:34,621
capable of.
Kind of just let it go.

2609
02:01:34,621 --> 02:01:38,220
You're going to have to like try to 
crack the code and apparently they were 

2610
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:39,450
like spraying it into the New York 
subway system.

2611
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,020
That's crazy.
No,

2612
02:01:42,030 --> 02:01:42,410
it's.
Oh,

2613
02:01:42,411 --> 02:01:45,420
they had an entire CIA or house where 
they were taking.

2614
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:46,850
Yeah.
That's operation midnight.

2615
02:01:46,851 --> 02:01:51,060
Climax in San Francisco and New York.
The two different whorehouses.

2616
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:53,030
That's an amazing story.
I love that story.

2617
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:55,610
You gotTa Google that folks because it's
amazing.

2618
02:01:55,700 --> 02:01:57,710
They ran brothels where they dosed 
dudes.

2619
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:02,980
Poor guy.
Just killing in there for some sexual 

2620
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:03,710
relief just to just take.
I'll take his mind off.

2621
02:02:03,711 --> 02:02:05,660
It's horrible day.
Hey,

2622
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:07,580
would you like to drink honey?
He's like,

2623
02:02:07,581 --> 02:02:09,500
yeah,
I just said Jack and coke or do me great

2624
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:13,400
jack and coke with acid.
Oh No,

2625
02:02:13,970 --> 02:02:16,570
what the fuck man.
They really didn't know them.

2626
02:02:16,650 --> 02:02:17,960
I mean,
they probably had an idea,

2627
02:02:17,961 --> 02:02:22,961
but there was the anthropological 
reports of what Indians do when they 

2628
02:02:22,961 --> 02:02:23,360
take pod,
but they had no idea how.

2629
02:02:23,361 --> 02:02:28,361
Just some businessman.
Well apparently they started doing it 

2630
02:02:28,361 --> 02:02:31,511
once.
They stopped getting people that are 

2631
02:02:31,511 --> 02:02:34,481
willing to sign up for their,
for the voluntary tests that too many 

2632
02:02:34,671 --> 02:02:38,150
people were getting fucked up by the 
tests and so this is what I had read was

2633
02:02:38,151 --> 02:02:41,930
that they switched to a dosing people 
when they ran out of volunteers.

2634
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:47,140
Huh?
I would imagine they would have had 

2635
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:48,020
volunteers especially later on in these 
programs and they were becoming publicly

2636
02:02:48,050 --> 02:02:50,860
known substances,
but yet a lot of the early research,

2637
02:02:50,900 --> 02:02:55,900
there's a book called drugs and fantasy 
where it's just people being dosed with 

2638
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:58,130
PCP and I think the France one was like 
51 or something like that,

2639
02:02:58,131 --> 02:02:59,710
wasn't it?
It was just something.

2640
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:05,340
Yeah.
It's really terrifying to think they 

2641
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:05,480
actually did do that.
You believe it.

2642
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:08,840
The downs,
the whole town.

2643
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:11,770
Let's see what happens.
You know nuts.

2644
02:03:12,650 --> 02:03:17,650
You've seen,
you've seen the videos of them dousing 

2645
02:03:17,650 --> 02:03:17,650
soldiers.
Right?

2646
02:03:17,650 --> 02:03:20,351
If she ended up,
because I believe it was the English 

2647
02:03:20,351 --> 02:03:22,121
army know they just wandering around.
It's amazing and people died in that 

2648
02:03:22,121 --> 02:03:22,790
French town.
It was,

2649
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:26,330
didn't he commit suicide?
People jumped off bridges.

2650
02:03:26,331 --> 02:03:27,830
I mean,
I guess it's the same kind of stuff that

2651
02:03:27,831 --> 02:03:31,280
happens today with psychedelics for 
certain people respond badly and want to

2652
02:03:31,281 --> 02:03:32,390
jump off of things.

2653
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:37,420
Do you support the theory that that was 
the cause of the Salem witch trials and 

2654
02:03:37,671 --> 02:03:40,610
all that stuff that it was an Erg got 
infection.

2655
02:03:42,090 --> 02:03:44,150
You know that story.
Do you know that story?

2656
02:03:45,230 --> 02:03:50,230
I know that they claim that which brooms
or an implement for vaginally 

2657
02:03:50,230 --> 02:03:52,900
administering scopolamine and atrophying
and all of these fronts.

2658
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,970
Delirium,
Christ vaginally,

2659
02:03:55,971 --> 02:04:00,470
distributing with a pole that seems so 
crude and uncreative.

2660
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:05,560
That's one idea,
but I don't know about or God in 

2661
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:05,560
witches.
No.

2662
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:05,780
Wow.
What is it?

2663
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:07,340
Um,
it's,

2664
02:04:07,341 --> 02:04:09,010
um,
it's,

2665
02:04:09,230 --> 02:04:09,930
it's,
um,

2666
02:04:10,070 --> 02:04:11,780
a fungus apparently.
Oh yeah.

2667
02:04:11,781 --> 02:04:16,781
I know about it.
And apparently it has some psychoactive 

2668
02:04:16,781 --> 02:04:17,510
effects and they didn't get like a 
poisoning from it and then give you some

2669
02:04:17,511 --> 02:04:22,511
sort of a psychoactive effect.
And they thought it was responsible for 

2670
02:04:22,511 --> 02:04:22,511
a graph.
Yeah.

2671
02:04:22,511 --> 02:04:23,690
They thought it could have been 
responsible for people that thought they

2672
02:04:23,691 --> 02:04:25,990
were experiencing magic and they were 
hallucinating.

2673
02:04:26,020 --> 02:04:26,510
They were,
you know,

2674
02:04:26,511 --> 02:04:28,190
getting fucked up and,
you know,

2675
02:04:28,191 --> 02:04:30,650
and they could've started blaming it on 
women,

2676
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:31,580
which is,
which do,

2677
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:36,860
you can't get laid.
So you're all fucked up on this crazy 

2678
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:36,860
bread is Erg.
Got,

2679
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:38,130
you know,
apparently if you've

2680
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:40,080
never heard of or got being psychotic.

2681
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:40,710
Oh,
absolutely.

2682
02:04:40,711 --> 02:04:40,930
Yeah.
No,

2683
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:41,550
it is.
Yeah.

2684
02:04:41,551 --> 02:04:44,990
And that's really what is the effect,
like what is the effect of or got like,

2685
02:04:45,110 --> 02:04:47,400
um,
well it contains just a variety of these

2686
02:04:47,401 --> 02:04:50,760
different ergo line substances.
But there's lysergic acid,

2687
02:04:50,790 --> 02:04:53,190
amides and um,
and,

2688
02:04:53,191 --> 02:04:56,700
and they were used medicinally for,
for a very long time.

2689
02:04:56,760 --> 02:05:01,760
That was the reason that lsd was 
discovered is because they were using 

2690
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:05,540
these isolating different alkaloids from
or got Sclerosia and trying to see if 

2691
02:05:05,731 --> 02:05:10,731
they had some use in,
in preventing postpartum bleeding in 

2692
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:12,980
pregnant women.
And yeah,

2693
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:18,050
so it wasn't,
they weren't investigating psychoactive 

2694
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:19,350
drugs that had some interest in using 
them as potential analytics,

2695
02:05:19,351 --> 02:05:21,480
like drugs to reduce fatigue.
And that was this one,

2696
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:26,600
nootropic hydro gene was produced by 
Albert Hoffman in the course of that 

2697
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:30,951
study,
but they certainly weren't looking for 

2698
02:05:30,951 --> 02:05:30,951
anything like LSD,

2699
02:05:30,951 --> 02:05:31,470
wasn't lsd.
There was.

2700
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:36,500
There were some,
some people that they were looking for 

2701
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:38,130
something to make women more fertile or 
something along those lines.

2702
02:05:38,910 --> 02:05:43,910
What the fuck that I read to something 
that would encourage women to ovulate?

2703
02:05:45,181 --> 02:05:47,580
Is that true?
Did I read nonsense?

2704
02:05:47,930 --> 02:05:49,410
I don't know.
I mean it happens all the time.

2705
02:05:49,411 --> 02:05:51,420
It's out of my head.
I hate that.

2706
02:05:51,421 --> 02:05:54,420
I hate when I have a thought that I 
can't wrap my head around.

2707
02:05:54,421 --> 02:05:56,310
There's too much goddamn information 
online.

2708
02:05:56,470 --> 02:05:56,750
Yeah.

2709
02:05:57,790 --> 02:05:59,500
But that happens all the time.
And in medical,

2710
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:03,330
they'll be trying to create for one 
thing and wow,

2711
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:05,650
that's the story of Viagra probably 
drove to keep them,

2712
02:06:05,830 --> 02:06:06,350
to stop them.

2713
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:10,380
Bitchin I mean.
Yeah,

2714
02:06:10,381 --> 02:06:11,490
Brian,
that's what it is.

2715
02:06:11,970 --> 02:06:16,970
Let me ask you this,
because you're a rational guy that does 

2716
02:06:16,970 --> 02:06:17,070
the stuff.
You're obviously very well read.

2717
02:06:17,130 --> 02:06:22,130
You know what you're talking about.
Clearly when you have an intense I could

2718
02:06:22,531 --> 02:06:27,531
delegate experience and when you 
experience what seems to be something 

2719
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:35,900
that is not you,
something that you're interacting with 

2720
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:36,480
that does not appear to be the 
imagination.

2721
02:06:37,170 --> 02:06:39,030
It could be,
I don't know,

2722
02:06:39,450 --> 02:06:44,450
but a lot of people,
a lot of people have interesting 

2723
02:06:44,450 --> 02:06:48,050
opinions.
A lot of people that have seen real 

2724
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:49,140
intense psychedelic visions have very 
interesting opinions and you,

2725
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:54,500
you might be the most psychedelically 
traveled person I've ever met in my 

2726
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:55,290
life,
so it's a perfect combination for you to

2727
02:06:55,291 --> 02:06:57,810
be the guy that answers that question.
What the fuck is going on?

2728
02:06:57,870 --> 02:07:00,540
When you have an intense psychedelic 
experience,

2729
02:07:00,570 --> 02:07:05,570
is it just chemicals perturbing your 
natural brain state?

2730
02:07:05,650 --> 02:07:05,960
What?

2731
02:07:06,330 --> 02:07:07,380
I think it's.
I think it is,

2732
02:07:07,381 --> 02:07:12,381
but st just chemical chemicals is 
already kind of problematic because 

2733
02:07:12,381 --> 02:07:12,381
chemical,
everything's just chemicals.

2734
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:17,660
Chemicals is absolutely everything you 
ever experienced and remember 

2735
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:18,300
remembering I've ever lived,
so everything is a chemical phenomenon.

2736
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:23,450
Consciousness as a chemical phenomenon.
The fact they were able to perceive any 

2737
02:07:23,450 --> 02:07:24,210
of this.
We'll have this conversation right now.

2738
02:07:24,211 --> 02:07:26,570
It's all an amazing chemical 
interactions,

2739
02:07:26,571 --> 02:07:31,571
so I don't see the need to bring in any 
kind of supernatural interpretation of 

2740
02:07:31,681 --> 02:07:35,530
the phenomenon because it just is not 
necessarily the same reason that I don't

2741
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:41,040
see the need to bring in a supernatural 
interpretation of the universe or or of 

2742
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:42,940
anything else or even ghosts.
You know,

2743
02:07:42,941 --> 02:07:45,790
you can look at,
if you look at a ghost haunting,

2744
02:07:45,791 --> 02:07:47,200
you can look at it two ways.
You can say,

2745
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:52,380
oh,
this was a weird supernatural 

2746
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:52,380
experience.
Or You could say this was a really weird

2747
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:56,250
moment of psychopathology and what 
psychological mechanism may this person 

2748
02:07:56,250 --> 02:08:00,540
so afraid that they hallucinated and 
thought they heard something or thought 

2749
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:00,680
they saw another being,
which is equally fascinating,

2750
02:08:00,681 --> 02:08:05,681
if not more fascinating,
or there's a dude who didn't get enough 

2751
02:08:05,681 --> 02:08:08,551
attention from his parents or pretends 
to see God is in the basement and watch 

2752
02:08:08,551 --> 02:08:11,230
a show with night vision.
That could be the case too.

2753
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:13,180
I mean,
I almost feel like that's the.

2754
02:08:13,230 --> 02:08:16,450
Like the lesser interpretation.
It's the easy way.

2755
02:08:16,850 --> 02:08:17,980
It's much easier to say,
oh,

2756
02:08:17,981 --> 02:08:18,770
they're aliens.

2757
02:08:18,770 --> 02:08:23,770
That's very simple.
Whereas if you actually wonder what is 

2758
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:25,660
the true biochemical basis of this 
phenomenon,

2759
02:08:25,661 --> 02:08:28,960
it's an incredibly complicated question 
and it won't have a simple answer,

2760
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:31,750
but that's why it's a worthwhile 
question.

2761
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:36,840
Do you believe that it's possible that 
taking something along the lines of Bmt 

2762
02:08:37,211 --> 02:08:41,680
or any really intense psychedelic 
actually opens up some sort of a door to

2763
02:08:41,681 --> 02:08:43,990
another dimension,
another place,

2764
02:08:43,991 --> 02:08:48,991
another exist in something that you can 
experience another frequency and other 

2765
02:08:48,991 --> 02:08:50,890
station on the dial?
I think other dimensions of yourself,

2766
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:55,920
certainly I don't know that there's 
another physical dimension that you are 

2767
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:56,200
accessing.
I wouldn't.

2768
02:08:56,260 --> 02:09:01,260
I don't see any reason to believe that.
I think there's enough inside of all of 

2769
02:09:01,260 --> 02:09:04,111
us to account for that.
So you think that when you have this 

2770
02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:09,160
incredible,
like massive visual experience,

2771
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:14,310
it's all an imagined Tory thing.
It's not like your consciousness travels

2772
02:09:15,221 --> 02:09:17,950
to a place more tunes into a frequency.

2773
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:20,000
No,
I don't think that.

2774
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:25,020
So you think it's just a chemical 
reaction but in incredibly fascinating,

2775
02:09:25,091 --> 02:09:28,870
accomplished or chemical and I'm 
absolutely not arguing with you.

2776
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:30,690
I'm not sold on what the hell it is and 
I've.

2777
02:09:30,691 --> 02:09:35,691
I've had that argument with people that 
are really almost like they almost 

2778
02:09:35,691 --> 02:09:37,260
proselytize about the experience to the 
point where they're,

2779
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:42,330
you know,
they're talking about like as if it's a 

2780
02:09:42,330 --> 02:09:42,330
religious,
a religious,

2781
02:09:42,330 --> 02:09:42,330
definite,
you know,

2782
02:09:42,330 --> 02:09:43,570
this is what happens,
this is what happens.

2783
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:45,190
And I've always said,
you know,

2784
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:47,590
maybe it's possible,
but it's also possible.

2785
02:09:47,591 --> 02:09:52,591
It's just crazy chemicals.
It doesn't mean it's not spiritual 

2786
02:09:52,591 --> 02:09:52,591
spiritual benefits.
That's fine.

2787
02:09:52,591 --> 02:09:57,450
It doesn't mean that they don't have,
they can't have a religious experience 

2788
02:09:57,450 --> 02:09:57,450
or they can't interpret it however they 
want,

2789
02:09:57,450 --> 02:10:00,580
but I sure the interaction is beautiful.
If the interaction is beautiful,

2790
02:10:00,581 --> 02:10:03,880
it doesn't have to be other worldly for 
it to be defined.

2791
02:10:04,330 --> 02:10:05,740
You know,
the interaction is beautiful.

2792
02:10:05,741 --> 02:10:08,380
It could set you off on another 
direction.

2793
02:10:08,381 --> 02:10:10,420
Rewire your board.
I mean,

2794
02:10:10,421 --> 02:10:15,421
how many people have you ever talked to 
that have had a big psychedelic 

2795
02:10:15,421 --> 02:10:15,850
experience and totally stopped doing 
pills,

2796
02:10:15,851 --> 02:10:20,851
are totally stopped smoking cigarettes 
or just completely rewired their life 

2797
02:10:20,851 --> 02:10:23,410
because of one like emphatic psychedelic
rewiring.

2798
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:25,150
Yeah,
absolutely.

2799
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:27,310
Absolutely.
And uh,

2800
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:29,020
but yeah,
I just think that you think.

2801
02:10:29,110 --> 02:10:29,860
I'm sorry,
go ahead.

2802
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:31,150
Well anyway,
just the,

2803
02:10:31,151 --> 02:10:33,870
just the chemical thing,
it's just something to be careful with

2804
02:10:34,060 --> 02:10:35,250
and when interpreting things,
no,

2805
02:10:35,260 --> 02:10:36,250
you're fine.
It's just a chemical.

2806
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:36,730
Everything is just,

2807
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:39,550
I sound too dumb to be talking about the
first place.

2808
02:10:39,570 --> 02:10:42,350
I'm just trying to skate by with my 
limited knowledge I have,

2809
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:47,360
but I want to pick your brain so when 
you experience like really profound 

2810
02:10:49,130 --> 02:10:53,810
wisdom in um,
in psychedelic states or you have like,

2811
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:58,900
you know,
this almost feeling of being analyzed 

2812
02:10:58,900 --> 02:11:01,451
and like seeing through and shown all 
your flaws and all your craziness and 

2813
02:11:01,451 --> 02:11:02,420
then you have this sort of like a reset 
thing.

2814
02:11:02,421 --> 02:11:07,421
We kind of get a new fresh perspective 
of your place in the world and how 

2815
02:11:07,421 --> 02:11:07,810
you're,
what kind of an energy,

2816
02:11:07,850 --> 02:11:12,850
what kind of vibe you're putting out.
You think that that's all maybe 

2817
02:11:12,850 --> 02:11:12,850
internal,
that's all.

2818
02:11:12,850 --> 02:11:16,781
Maybe imagination or is it,
is there the potential that there is 

2819
02:11:16,781 --> 02:11:16,781
some sort of,
uh,

2820
02:11:16,781 --> 02:11:21,650
another intelligence out there?
There's some sort of a thing that you 

2821
02:11:21,650 --> 02:11:25,541
can tune into some sort of a way that 
we're connected to but we don't have 

2822
02:11:27,251 --> 02:11:30,440
access on a regular basis.
Is that possible or is it silly?

2823
02:11:30,690 --> 02:11:35,690
I don't think that it's,
there's no reason to believe that that 

2824
02:11:35,690 --> 02:11:40,131
is possible,
but I think that there's all kinds of 

2825
02:11:40,131 --> 02:11:41,400
things within us that we don't currently
acknowledged and understand.

2826
02:11:41,401 --> 02:11:44,520
I mean Shogun Shogun and Timothy leary 
talked about this idea,

2827
02:11:44,521 --> 02:11:49,521
you know,
this is all this noncoding DNA that's 

2828
02:11:49,521 --> 02:11:50,870
sometimes called junk DNA or in Toronto 
Dna and uh,

2829
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,980
and although it doesn't,
they were probably wrong about that.

2830
02:11:53,981 --> 02:11:58,830
So it doesn't contain any kind of like 
instinctual evolutionary knowledge,

2831
02:11:58,831 --> 02:11:59,760
but,
but there was,

2832
02:11:59,910 --> 02:12:04,910
they were using it as an example,
like what if all this noncoding DNA 

2833
02:12:04,910 --> 02:12:08,150
contains instinctual ancient knowledge,
they're able to access will or on 

2834
02:12:08,150 --> 02:12:08,280
psychedelics,
um,

2835
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:11,790
but maybe not with specifically with the
noncoding DNA,

2836
02:12:11,791 --> 02:12:16,791
but with parts of the brain,
with who knows what sorts of things are 

2837
02:12:16,791 --> 02:12:16,920
stored within us that we don't know how 
to access.

2838
02:12:16,921 --> 02:12:19,650
I think that it is actually a 
scientologist idea,

2839
02:12:19,651 --> 02:12:24,651
but I think that there's some truth to 
the idea that we remember absolutely 

2840
02:12:24,651 --> 02:12:25,760
everything that we experienced,
that it's all in there somewhere.

2841
02:12:25,790 --> 02:12:29,440
You just need the right catalyst to 
remove that piece of information.

2842
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:30,870
Wow,

2843
02:12:30,970 --> 02:12:31,990
that's amazing.
Well,

2844
02:12:31,991 --> 02:12:36,991
sometimes someone will bring something 
up and then all of sudden the file will 

2845
02:12:36,991 --> 02:12:36,991
open up in your head and you're like,
yeah,

2846
02:12:36,991 --> 02:12:37,690
that guy.
Where is he?

2847
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:39,480
What has he been doing?
Like boom,

2848
02:12:39,610 --> 02:12:41,490
all of a sudden some person who you 
have,

2849
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:43,450
I could have come up to you,
do you know of,

2850
02:12:43,451 --> 02:12:44,720
of Bruce Blah Blah,
blah,

2851
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:45,430
and you'd be like,
no,

2852
02:12:45,431 --> 02:12:50,431
I have no idea who that is.
But then somebody shows you a picture 

2853
02:12:50,431 --> 02:12:50,431
and says,
you remember this guy,

2854
02:12:50,431 --> 02:12:50,431
second grade,
remember?

2855
02:12:50,431 --> 02:12:50,740
And you're like,
Whoa,

2856
02:12:50,741 --> 02:12:51,460
yeah,
click,

2857
02:12:51,461 --> 02:12:56,461
click.
All of a sudden the file's open and 

2858
02:12:56,461 --> 02:12:56,461
you'll remember several experiences.
You might've had that person.

2859
02:12:56,461 --> 02:12:59,470
It's almost like we don't have enough 
room for all the shit we're saying.

2860
02:13:00,010 --> 02:13:05,010
We just put stuff in shitty hard drives 
and stuff in the closet and then every 

2861
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:05,260
now and then it comes out,

2862
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:05,890
right?
I mean,

2863
02:13:05,891 --> 02:13:08,200
it's like an indexing problem.
That information is there,

2864
02:13:08,201 --> 02:13:09,790
but we don't always know how to access 
it.

2865
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:12,390
You remember that show taxing?
Um,

2866
02:13:12,430 --> 02:13:13,150
I'm familiar.

2867
02:13:13,370 --> 02:13:18,370
Marilu Henner,
remember the very attractive redhead 

2868
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:18,370
woman that was on that show?
No,

2869
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:20,000
she's got some crazy memory thing.
She was on stern show.

2870
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:23,150
She can remember everything.
She has an insane memory.

2871
02:13:23,151 --> 02:13:25,400
Like she can tell you,
like you can tell her,

2872
02:13:25,401 --> 02:13:26,720
you know,
June 13th,

2873
02:13:26,721 --> 02:13:27,920
19,
76.

2874
02:13:28,070 --> 02:13:29,110
What were you wearing?
She was like,

2875
02:13:29,111 --> 02:13:31,870
I was wearing a blue dress and because I
was on my way to this and that it was.

2876
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:37,120
And she'll,
she can tell you what the temperature 

2877
02:13:37,120 --> 02:13:37,120
was outside.
She can tell you everything.

2878
02:13:37,120 --> 02:13:38,640
She remembers everything.
Yeah,

2879
02:13:38,730 --> 02:13:39,540
no,
it is possible.

2880
02:13:39,541 --> 02:13:41,910
It's very much in the size of a normal 
head.

2881
02:13:41,911 --> 02:13:46,911
Those things are possible.
We don't need giant brains and the size 

2882
02:13:46,911 --> 02:13:46,911
of a normal head and she's not even a 
nut.

2883
02:13:46,911 --> 02:13:48,900
Like she's like a normal person.
Like you talked to her.

2884
02:13:48,901 --> 02:13:53,901
She sounds normal.
It doesn't sound like some maladjusted 

2885
02:13:53,901 --> 02:13:54,510
person with some incredible gift.
She's not like a rain man,

2886
02:13:54,690 --> 02:13:56,520
just like a normal human being,
you know,

2887
02:13:56,530 --> 02:13:58,230
there's.
And there's lots of these new modernists

2888
02:13:58,260 --> 02:14:03,260
that are capable of those sorts of the 
mind feeds.

2889
02:14:04,351 --> 02:14:09,351
But uh,
and one interesting thing about the new 

2890
02:14:09,351 --> 02:14:09,351
monitors,
they all seem to have synesthesia.

2891
02:14:09,351 --> 02:14:10,710
At least ones that I've read about and 
uh,

2892
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:16,040
so when they remember something,
it's a visual memory and an auditory 

2893
02:14:16,040 --> 02:14:19,821
memory and all,
and all their memories are cross linked 

2894
02:14:19,821 --> 02:14:19,821
over multiple sensory modalities.

2895
02:14:19,821 --> 02:14:21,130
So it's like,
uh,

2896
02:14:21,131 --> 02:14:21,510
and then,
uh,

2897
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:26,540
and then there was a lot of research in 
the seventies about potentially using 

2898
02:14:26,540 --> 02:14:30,201
psychedelics as cognitive enhancers and 
I think that's one way that they could 

2899
02:14:30,201 --> 02:14:34,131
function is by encouraging this type of 
synesthetic thinking where you're 

2900
02:14:34,131 --> 02:14:36,630
experiencing everything through multiple
senses,

2901
02:14:36,631 --> 02:14:39,690
an indexing information through multiple
senses simultaneously.

2902
02:14:39,750 --> 02:14:41,160
What do you think about the 
controversial,

2903
02:14:41,161 --> 02:14:43,110
stoned ape theory?
Oh,

2904
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:48,680
well,
I don't think there's any evidence for 

2905
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:48,680
it,
but that's like a lot of parents,

2906
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:48,680
we kind of stuff.
I like it.

2907
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:50,790
I think it's interesting and worthwhile 
and funny and sexy.

2908
02:14:50,970 --> 02:14:51,840
Yeah,
it's good.

2909
02:14:51,841 --> 02:14:53,580
I'm glad that he said everything that he
said.

2910
02:14:53,581 --> 02:14:55,050
I don't agree with it.
A lot of it,

2911
02:14:55,051 --> 02:14:56,640
but uh,
some of it's a little wonky.

2912
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:57,510
Yeah.
A lot of it is,

2913
02:14:57,511 --> 02:14:59,340
but that's not much fun.
Yeah,

2914
02:14:59,341 --> 02:15:01,080
it's good.
It's all good.

2915
02:15:01,430 --> 02:15:03,420
Yeah.
And even the stuff that's Wonky,

2916
02:15:03,421 --> 02:15:08,421
I'm always willing to give him the 
benefit of the doubt that I just don't 

2917
02:15:08,421 --> 02:15:08,421
see that he seen it.

2918
02:15:08,421 --> 02:15:08,421
And that's,
you know,

2919
02:15:08,421 --> 02:15:11,400
that's most science anyway.
It's just people coming up with theories

2920
02:15:11,401 --> 02:15:13,860
and models and trying to improve the 
model.

2921
02:15:13,861 --> 02:15:15,720
So he came up with a model or theory 
that was wrong.

2922
02:15:15,721 --> 02:15:18,570
There's nothing bad about that.
He was just stoned ape theory.

2923
02:15:18,571 --> 02:15:22,320
Is it wrong as far as like the time 
frame of,

2924
02:15:22,321 --> 02:15:25,050
of history and development?
Like because that's what I've.

2925
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:28,470
I think I read that.
I read that he got his,

2926
02:15:28,950 --> 02:15:31,720
his errors wrong or something.
Um,

2927
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:34,620
I don't think there was any evidence 
that primates eat mushrooms.

2928
02:15:34,621 --> 02:15:36,600
Maybe I'm wrong about that.
I don't know that.

2929
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:39,150
I don't think that.
I think the evidence that he was relying

2930
02:15:39,151 --> 02:15:44,151
on for that theory that uh,
either it was LSD or psilocybin 

2931
02:15:44,151 --> 02:15:48,171
increases visual acuity.
I don't think that that's been 

2932
02:15:48,171 --> 02:15:50,510
definitively proven science that we've 
noticed published in a prestigious 

2933
02:15:50,510 --> 02:15:50,510
journal at the time.

2934
02:15:50,510 --> 02:15:53,100
I'm not sure that all of that research 
was methodologically sound.

2935
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:53,810
You know,
what the,

2936
02:15:53,850 --> 02:15:58,850
how the study works,
you don't think they only had like two 

2937
02:15:58,850 --> 02:15:58,850
sticks that were,
weren't parallel lines,

2938
02:15:58,850 --> 02:16:03,510
and then they would have someone turning
one stick on the other side of extremely

2939
02:16:03,511 --> 02:16:07,740
slowly to the point where they would no 
longer be parallel.

2940
02:16:07,890 --> 02:16:12,060
And it was who could recognize that the 
first and the stone people recognized it

2941
02:16:12,210 --> 02:16:15,430
more than the nonstop people on.
So his,

2942
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:20,680
his joke was that maybe being stoned,
you see the world better than it really 

2943
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:21,800
is or better than you can when you're 
sober.

2944
02:16:21,810 --> 02:16:22,620
Other.
Yeah.

2945
02:16:22,621 --> 02:16:24,610
I mean it hasn't really been studied 
very extensive.

2946
02:16:24,611 --> 02:16:26,490
So even though it was published,
it could've been horseshit.

2947
02:16:26,491 --> 02:16:29,260
Like you would have to be replicated a 
few times.

2948
02:16:29,270 --> 02:16:30,010
Yeah,
I think

2949
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,240
it would be.
Yeah.

2950
02:16:31,241 --> 02:16:31,980
Um,
I,

2951
02:16:31,990 --> 02:16:33,740
I,
that seemed like a weird one too because

2952
02:16:33,741 --> 02:16:35,290
like,
who's going to take a little dose?

2953
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:36,930
You know,
if you're going to have mushrooms you're

2954
02:16:36,931 --> 02:16:41,931
going to blast off.
I just don't see it being to the point 

2955
02:16:41,931 --> 02:16:42,910
where you're going to take like a little
tiny doses of it so you can see better.

2956
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:45,010
You know,
if you have the blast off thing,

2957
02:16:45,011 --> 02:16:46,270
you're not going to be saying like,
well,

2958
02:16:46,271 --> 02:16:49,180
what if I just don't blast off?
What if I just nibble,

2959
02:16:49,181 --> 02:16:51,700
nibble,
nibble so I can barely feel it?

2960
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:54,040
Who's going to do that to go hunting?
That's ridiculous.

2961
02:16:54,070 --> 02:16:56,370
Or maybe they didn't even know that you 
could play for awhile.

2962
02:16:56,530 --> 02:17:01,530
Thinking Salvia people don't realize 
until the nineties until they started 

2963
02:17:01,530 --> 02:17:02,410
extracting it and making those extracts 
publicly available.

2964
02:17:02,470 --> 02:17:03,790
People didn't really know their,
you know,

2965
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:04,760
their chewing and say,
oh yeah,

2966
02:17:04,761 --> 02:17:09,761
it is active,
but they couldn't really characterize 

2967
02:17:09,761 --> 02:17:09,990
the effect until he had concentrated the
Salvinorin a,

2968
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:15,240
it is a trip that they look like dinner 
plates to trip that they just grow out 

2969
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:15,240
of the ground.

2970
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:15,250
They look like,
Hey,

2971
02:17:15,251 --> 02:17:19,140
look at me.
Did you know when mushrooms grow mean?

2972
02:17:19,630 --> 02:17:24,630
Like there's a green field and it's 
green grass and this white thing just 

2973
02:17:25,261 --> 02:17:26,650
like,
here I am,

2974
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:28,930
and it's like asking you to eat it.
I mean,

2975
02:17:28,931 --> 02:17:30,460
if there's anything that's ever asked 
me,

2976
02:17:30,461 --> 02:17:33,190
it's a polite and subtle color.
I'm white,

2977
02:17:33,370 --> 02:17:35,710
I'm so bland,
don't even worry.

2978
02:17:35,711 --> 02:17:37,870
Just come home and take a bite.
I mean,

2979
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:43,650
and the idea that,
that they might have actually not even 

2980
02:17:43,650 --> 02:17:46,300
from this planet and they might've come 
here and asteroidal impacts.

2981
02:17:46,330 --> 02:17:47,230
Sure.
You know,

2982
02:17:47,290 --> 02:17:49,140
that's my favorite one.
That's the,

2983
02:17:49,170 --> 02:17:51,910
my favorite sexy theory.
You know,

2984
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:53,730
that there's another mechanic theory,
right?

2985
02:17:53,731 --> 02:17:56,620
Whereas he or he,
he supported the idea that,

2986
02:17:56,621 --> 02:17:58,390
uh,
he said you would know this.

2987
02:17:58,391 --> 02:17:59,420
He said that,
um,

2988
02:17:59,890 --> 02:18:03,850
silicide Ben.
There was no other plant that was our,

2989
02:18:04,670 --> 02:18:08,050
that had the four and the [inaudible] 
position or no other,

2990
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:11,230
no other life form fungus that had that.

2991
02:18:11,490 --> 02:18:16,490
It was the only one except for 
hydroxylation is unusual and there's a 

2992
02:18:16,490 --> 02:18:19,090
lot of five in the plant kingdom for the
four is unusual.

2993
02:18:19,510 --> 02:18:24,510
Is there other other ones besides.
I'm not that I can think of off the top 

2994
02:18:26,981 --> 02:18:29,320
of.
So his theory in mushrooms,

2995
02:18:29,350 --> 02:18:31,750
there's sites didn't,
things like that.

2996
02:18:32,050 --> 02:18:34,390
His theory was that that had come from 
a,

2997
02:18:34,391 --> 02:18:39,391
an asteroid impact that sports could 
survive in a vacuum when we know the 

2998
02:18:39,391 --> 02:18:41,680
building blocks of life and amino acids 
possibly came here from outer space.

2999
02:18:42,070 --> 02:18:44,870
Maybe mushrooms that,
that was them.

3000
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:50,040
They're communicating with you my plans 
to.

3001
02:18:51,910 --> 02:18:52,630
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3002
02:18:52,631 --> 02:18:54,460
He would buy the guy totally.
He meaning,

3003
02:18:54,490 --> 02:18:57,580
that's what made him write the timewave 
zero novelty theory.

3004
02:18:57,581 --> 02:18:58,270
He,
he,

3005
02:18:58,450 --> 02:19:00,280
you know,
they told him that he had to do it,

3006
02:19:01,410 --> 02:19:06,410
you know,
could you imagine how annoying would be 

3007
02:19:06,410 --> 02:19:06,410
every time you went on a trip,
you know,

3008
02:19:06,410 --> 02:19:08,010
you got some fucking alien mushroom 
people telling you,

3009
02:19:08,011 --> 02:19:13,011
you gotta write a theory.
You've got to write some biological 

3010
02:19:13,011 --> 02:19:13,011
theory.
Brian,

3011
02:19:13,011 --> 02:19:17,581
you could not look anymore board who's 
listening from now on foreheads and 

3012
02:19:17,581 --> 02:19:22,201
that's it.
Cut you off before you went to five and 

3013
02:19:22,201 --> 02:19:22,201
you can't handle five.
You think you can.

3014
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:26,290
Um,
so we got over the stoned ape theory.

3015
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:27,640
What else?
I want to ask you a

3016
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:31,200
alien life,
yes or no.

3017
02:19:32,860 --> 02:19:33,650
Again,
I mean,

3018
02:19:33,700 --> 02:19:38,700
all these things,
there just isn't enough evidence either 

3019
02:19:38,700 --> 02:19:41,821
way.
And I know that it's like a boring 

3020
02:19:41,821 --> 02:19:41,821
answer.
And in some ways,

3021
02:19:41,821 --> 02:19:41,821
but I just,
you know,

3022
02:19:41,821 --> 02:19:45,661
people will say like,
it's always huge news when they find an 

3023
02:19:45,661 --> 02:19:46,810
extra solar planet that might be able to
support earth like life,

3024
02:19:47,470 --> 02:19:50,770
but so far they've never found anywhere 
in the known universe,

3025
02:19:50,771 --> 02:19:55,030
a single planet that we could live on 
without a suit for a minute.

3026
02:19:56,380 --> 02:19:58,780
So that's not really that encouraging.
Ultimately.

3027
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:04,140
I like.
But then when you also factor in the 

3028
02:20:04,140 --> 02:20:04,140
enormity of the universe,
then of course,

3029
02:20:04,140 --> 02:20:05,350
I think it's possible.
Absolutely.

3030
02:20:05,351 --> 02:20:09,220
I think it's possible.
I just don't see at this specific moment

3031
02:20:09,221 --> 02:20:14,221
in history any reason to think that in 
the part of the universe that we've 

3032
02:20:14,221 --> 02:20:15,310
observed,
there's any life.

3033
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:20,520
What do you think of the theory that 
life does not come here in a physical 

3034
02:20:21,731 --> 02:20:23,980
sense,
but comes here through your mind in that

3035
02:20:23,981 --> 02:20:28,981
what psychedelics are is real like 
gateways to communicate with other life 

3036
02:20:28,981 --> 02:20:33,691
forms and that we were hung up on the 
idea that something has to actually be 

3037
02:20:33,691 --> 02:20:36,640
right there to talk to you.
Um,

3038
02:20:36,890 --> 02:20:38,060
wait something.
The theory,

3039
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:43,120
the theory is.
And psychedelics opened up some sort of 

3040
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:45,440
a gateway that allows you to communicate
with aliens.

3041
02:20:45,441 --> 02:20:50,441
That's the only aliens have.
There are the aliens only exist in this 

3042
02:20:50,570 --> 02:20:53,150
is when you take a psychedelic,
you can communicate with it.

3043
02:20:53,151 --> 02:20:56,860
You can enter into some sort of a 
frequency that the alien is on.

3044
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:59,360
That's the only way they get here.
They don't get here through metal ships.

3045
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:01,430
That's all just craziness.
Uh,

3046
02:21:01,431 --> 02:21:03,660
alien contact only comes through 
psychedelics.

3047
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:05,450
It's an interesting idea

3048
02:21:07,540 --> 02:21:12,540
to what end are very dismissive.
But I believe,

3049
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:15,030
I forget who was.
Yeah,

3050
02:21:15,031 --> 02:21:15,050
whose

3051
02:21:15,110 --> 02:21:16,650
idea that was.
But there was a.

3052
02:21:16,870 --> 02:21:20,910
God Damn it when the aliens or whatever 
they watch when they're in our bodies.

3053
02:21:21,030 --> 02:21:26,030
I don't know.
It might've been when Kennedy's idea as 

3054
02:21:26,030 --> 02:21:26,030
well.
Yeah.

3055
02:21:26,030 --> 02:21:26,030
He had a lot of nutty ones abroad about 
mushrooms.

3056
02:21:26,030 --> 02:21:29,781
I'm pretty sure it was him,
but his idea was that it was an alien 

3057
02:21:29,781 --> 02:21:30,060
life form.
And then that's how you would,

3058
02:21:30,090 --> 02:21:35,090
you would communicate with it.
He didn't think it was going to come 

3059
02:21:35,090 --> 02:21:37,341
here and metal shifts.
He thinks it was going to come here 

3060
02:21:37,341 --> 02:21:39,410
through the frequency that you would 
achieve heavy duty psychedelic state 

3061
02:21:39,410 --> 02:21:42,120
that he believes he believes he was 
really encountering something else.

3062
02:21:42,490 --> 02:21:47,490
You don't believe that you don't know.
You believe that it's just just the 

3063
02:21:47,490 --> 02:21:52,370
deepest facets of your imagination or is
there a kashic records like do you 

3064
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:53,430
believe in any of that?
What is that?

3065
02:21:53,540 --> 02:21:54,780
The ACACIA,
Acacia,

3066
02:21:55,050 --> 02:21:55,900
Acacia,
Greg Kaushik.

3067
02:21:56,520 --> 02:22:01,520
The idea that there's knowledge and 
information out there and you just tune 

3068
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:05,121
into it and that there's a record of 
information and like literally exists 

3069
02:22:05,121 --> 02:22:06,810
that you can just tune into and this is 
where creativity comes from.

3070
02:22:07,080 --> 02:22:12,080
The other in creativity.
When you teach eve the zen state of 

3071
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:13,170
being completely in the moment,
these ideas would just come to you.

3072
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:17,640
The idea is that these ideas are not 
just the firing of your synapses and the

3073
02:22:17,641 --> 02:22:22,641
accumulation of your life experiences,
but in fact you are pulling from a well 

3074
02:22:22,641 --> 02:22:27,050
of information that's out there that you
can't quite recognized a regular basis 

3075
02:22:27,050 --> 02:22:31,520
and that there's.
There's knowledge inherent to to the 

3076
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:32,750
world and I think it's called the a cash
occur.

3077
02:22:32,751 --> 02:22:37,751
Acacia records is the idea behind.
It's almost like taking account to 

3078
02:22:38,450 --> 02:22:43,450
there.
It's almost like a crude way of 

3079
02:22:43,450 --> 02:22:45,120
explaining why we don't understand 
creativity.

3080
02:22:45,390 --> 02:22:48,000
While you know,
we don't understand the state of mind to

3081
02:22:48,001 --> 02:22:53,001
achieve the proper creativity is like 
this zen excepting sorta like when I'm 

3082
02:22:53,731 --> 02:22:55,140
in the zone.
When you're writing something,

3083
02:22:55,141 --> 02:22:57,830
you know you have great writing,
I read a bunch of Shit.

3084
02:22:57,831 --> 02:22:59,760
You,
you write some really beautiful lines,

3085
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:02,760
but you know how sometimes they just.
Sometimes you're banging them out,

3086
02:23:02,761 --> 02:23:07,761
but sometimes they're just flowing.
It's almost like they're coming out of 

3087
02:23:07,761 --> 02:23:11,121
you,
like you go into this zen state and 

3088
02:23:11,121 --> 02:23:11,121
like,
oh,

3089
02:23:11,121 --> 02:23:12,630
that just came to me like,
here's this thing.

3090
02:23:12,810 --> 02:23:17,810
Some people believe that the.
What you're doing is by being really 

3091
02:23:17,810 --> 02:23:20,910
creative,
you're tuning in to intelligence,

3092
02:23:20,911 --> 02:23:25,911
you're tuning into ideas and that the 
human body and it's managing as 

3093
02:23:25,911 --> 02:23:27,450
consciousness is really just managing a 
radio,

3094
02:23:28,170 --> 02:23:29,250
right?
I mean,

3095
02:23:29,251 --> 02:23:29,990
yeah,
there's a lot of that.

3096
02:23:30,050 --> 02:23:35,050
I find all those ideas kind of Hokey,
well just ultimately disempowering 

3097
02:23:35,050 --> 02:23:39,110
because the de emphasize the agency that
human beings have in creating,

3098
02:23:39,980 --> 02:23:41,190
oh,
we can create.

3099
02:23:41,191 --> 02:23:46,191
Our brains are not sufficient to create,
we need to tune into some kind of a 

3100
02:23:46,191 --> 02:23:46,590
record of that creates for us.
Um,

3101
02:23:46,650 --> 02:23:49,120
it's sort of a religious idea as well 
that,

3102
02:23:49,170 --> 02:23:53,100
that there's like a god that gives us 
some kind of power.

3103
02:23:53,101 --> 02:23:58,101
I think that's a pattern and a lot of 
these ideas is that they try to remove 

3104
02:23:58,101 --> 02:24:01,530
power from the individual and place it 
in some kind of intangible realm that we

3105
02:24:01,531 --> 02:24:06,210
can access through being pious or 
through following some set of rules.

3106
02:24:06,900 --> 02:24:11,340
But ultimately I don't want to buy into 
any of those ideas.

3107
02:24:11,910 --> 02:24:16,910
I,
I find that I completely agree with you 

3108
02:24:16,910 --> 02:24:20,250
and that I think that a big part of it 
is when people do better with creative 

3109
02:24:20,250 --> 02:24:24,991
endeavors when they're humble and so 
it's sort of a way of not taking credit 

3110
02:24:25,541 --> 02:24:29,800
for what they're doing and just tuning 
into the right creative frequency.

3111
02:24:30,010 --> 02:24:33,250
And sometimes that creative frequency,
the best way to do is just give it up to

3112
02:24:33,251 --> 02:24:34,210
like a higher power.

3113
02:24:34,290 --> 02:24:39,290
Sure.
And that's not to say that it doesn't 

3114
02:24:39,290 --> 02:24:39,290
help people in the same way that 
religion,

3115
02:24:39,290 --> 02:24:39,960
even if it's wrong,
helps an enormous number of people.

3116
02:24:40,020 --> 02:24:45,020
Well,
I've always said that it's a great 

3117
02:24:45,020 --> 02:24:45,270
operating system for a lot of people and
it really does enhance their life.

3118
02:24:45,271 --> 02:24:47,610
There's a lot of people that,
for whatever reason,

3119
02:24:47,611 --> 02:24:52,611
I don't know whether it's they're 
uninspired or whether they have brains 

3120
02:24:52,611 --> 02:24:55,260
that don't function at the right Rpms or
whatever it is.

3121
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:59,130
But if you give them a some sort of an 
ideology,

3122
02:24:59,131 --> 02:25:03,210
they can live a happy life.
But if you left them alone in the sea of

3123
02:25:03,450 --> 02:25:08,450
doubt and in the unknown,
they could go down any path they could.

3124
02:25:09,301 --> 02:25:11,600
They could wind up a mess.
They could wind up depressed.

3125
02:25:11,601 --> 02:25:13,890
I got mine up fucked up.
They can wind up in a cult.

3126
02:25:14,420 --> 02:25:17,730
You give them a happy religion to just 
live 70,

3127
02:25:17,731 --> 02:25:19,350
happy years,
die,

3128
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:22,440
be happy that they know they're going to
go to heaven and everything's cool.

3129
02:25:22,560 --> 02:25:24,940
It's almost like it's a,
it's an effective operating system.

3130
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:30,030
And at the end we were really not 
exactly sure how much of this fucking 

3131
02:25:30,030 --> 02:25:32,470
thing we're controlling with our mind.
We're really not.

3132
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:36,010
There's a lot of doubt on that.
There's a lot of doubt as to how much of

3133
02:25:36,011 --> 02:25:41,011
life is truly random and how much of it 
is really created by the energy you put 

3134
02:25:41,141 --> 02:25:43,480
out your imagination,
your,

3135
02:25:43,490 --> 02:25:46,480
your actions and your deeds.
What the fuck is really going on?

3136
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:48,910
Is it 100 percent physical or is there 
some.

3137
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:52,480
Is there some manifestation that the 
imagination takes part in?

3138
02:25:52,510 --> 02:25:56,770
We don't really necessarily know.
There's people that are always good.

3139
02:25:56,771 --> 02:26:01,771
Things are constantly happening to them 
and they're always in great moods and 

3140
02:26:01,771 --> 02:26:04,660
they seem to perpetrate that same energy
forward and you look at people like that

3141
02:26:04,661 --> 02:26:07,000
and you wonder like how much of that is 
them?

3142
02:26:07,030 --> 02:26:12,030
How much of that is they just figured 
out how to roll this thing and figured 

3143
02:26:12,030 --> 02:26:15,090
out how to create reality if they 
figured out how to just ride this thing 

3144
02:26:15,090 --> 02:26:15,090
correctly.
Is it possible?

3145
02:26:15,090 --> 02:26:15,430
Yes,
it is,

3146
02:26:15,431 --> 02:26:16,330
right?
Absolutely.

3147
02:26:16,331 --> 02:26:21,331
Yeah.
You're one of the most experienced guys 

3148
02:26:21,331 --> 02:26:24,511
I think I've ever come across and as far
as altered states of consciousness and 

3149
02:26:24,511 --> 02:26:24,511
you're not an old guy.
How old are you?

3150
02:26:24,511 --> 02:26:25,800
Thirty four.
Twenty four.

3151
02:26:25,810 --> 02:26:28,560
Jesus Christ son.
I was going to say you're 30.

3152
02:26:29,130 --> 02:26:31,540
You're a hard 24 kids.
I've seen them on the apple commercial.

3153
02:26:31,541 --> 02:26:33,790
You were really young and that one,
somebody just sent me that.

3154
02:26:33,820 --> 02:26:34,720
That's crazy.
Dude.

3155
02:26:34,721 --> 02:26:37,150
You're way too smart to be 24.
That's scary.

3156
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:39,130
It is.
That's fascinating,

3157
02:26:39,131 --> 02:26:40,840
man.
When I was 24,

3158
02:26:40,841 --> 02:26:44,410
I spoke in grunts for the most part.
That's amazing,

3159
02:26:44,411 --> 02:26:45,820
man.
Wow.

3160
02:26:45,970 --> 02:26:47,790
You um,
you.

3161
02:26:47,820 --> 02:26:48,360
Yeah.
You,

3162
02:26:48,390 --> 02:26:50,650
you must be the most experienced person 
I've ever met.

3163
02:26:50,651 --> 02:26:52,720
Right?
Many,

3164
02:26:52,770 --> 02:26:56,020
many more experienced in this case.
I actually don't know that.

3165
02:26:56,050 --> 02:26:58,690
All this stuff he's really done.
What do you take out of it,

3166
02:26:58,691 --> 02:26:59,240
man?
Do you,

3167
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:04,320
are you happy that you had all these 
experiences that changed you who you 

3168
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:04,320
are?
Absolutely.

3169
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:04,320
Yeah.
It's good.

3170
02:27:04,390 --> 02:27:07,210
I think just experimentation in general 
is important.

3171
02:27:07,211 --> 02:27:10,630
Can everybody handle it?
Probably not.

3172
02:27:10,810 --> 02:27:11,650
Probably not,
right?

3173
02:27:11,710 --> 02:27:13,750
Probably not,
but I'd be a fix that.

3174
02:27:14,380 --> 02:27:17,080
That's a very,
very complicated question.

3175
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:19,270
So good one though,
because you got a problem.

3176
02:27:19,271 --> 02:27:21,990
Some guys are good worker.
I think it requires.

3177
02:27:22,010 --> 02:27:23,890
She was good with the landscape in 
business.

3178
02:27:24,430 --> 02:27:27,090
So that fucking Hamilton Morris,
cardamom acid.

3179
02:27:27,730 --> 02:27:28,380
Sure.
Yeah.

3180
02:27:28,390 --> 02:27:33,390
No,
I've had close friends that dropped out 

3181
02:27:33,390 --> 02:27:33,880
of society for whatever reason because 
they started to find a pointless.

3182
02:27:33,881 --> 02:27:37,000
And it's difficult to argue with that if
someone really genuinely feels that way.

3183
02:27:37,270 --> 02:27:38,890
But um,
I think there's just a,

3184
02:27:38,910 --> 02:27:43,910
it's sort of an infantilizing gen 
generally disempowering idea in 

3185
02:27:43,910 --> 02:27:47,170
psychiatry and throughout society that 
we are not in control of ourselves.

3186
02:27:47,180 --> 02:27:49,660
We probably see a doctor.
The doctor is the expert on our mind and

3187
02:27:49,661 --> 02:27:54,661
our body and they tell us what's wrong.
They know us better than we know 

3188
02:27:54,661 --> 02:27:54,760
ourselves even after only talking to us 
for five minutes.

3189
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:57,430
And so if you go to a psychiatrist and 
you say,

3190
02:27:57,730 --> 02:28:02,140
I'm having trouble working,
may maybe depressed and they have adhd,

3191
02:28:02,141 --> 02:28:05,320
what do you think I should do?
I think that adderall would help me.

3192
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:10,400
It's immediately suspicious because you 
think you already know too much about 

3193
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:14,341
what you need.
They want you to go in as an infant 

3194
02:28:14,341 --> 02:28:14,341
that.
So they can tell you what you need,

3195
02:28:14,341 --> 02:28:18,840
I believe that you have,
there's some emphasis or some,

3196
02:28:18,941 --> 02:28:22,100
there's some impact at the imagination 
and your thinking and your energy

3197
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:27,100
has on life.
But I also believe there's a lot of 

3198
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:28,160
random shit too.
I don't think it's an either or.

3199
02:28:28,340 --> 02:28:33,340
I think it's a combination of you 
interacting with all these other people 

3200
02:28:33,340 --> 02:28:37,451
that are also creating their own 
realities at the same time and that you 

3201
02:28:37,451 --> 02:28:37,451
can have a,
you,

3202
02:28:37,451 --> 02:28:39,620
you,
you can all tune into a,

3203
02:28:39,621 --> 02:28:42,350
a good frequency and perhaps you know,
create a good community.

3204
02:28:42,351 --> 02:28:44,930
And I think that's what people try to do
it in tribes and shit like that.

3205
02:28:45,110 --> 02:28:47,930
But at the end of the day,
you're still dealing with random shit.

3206
02:28:48,170 --> 02:28:53,170
Like the idea that you blame people for 
fucking diseases or for being attacked 

3207
02:28:53,170 --> 02:28:53,910
by barbarians,
you know?

3208
02:28:53,911 --> 02:28:55,100
Is that,
was that in the secret,

3209
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:56,740
you know,
the secret work back 10.

3210
02:28:56,741 --> 02:28:59,390
Did they manifest these barbarians to 
come over the hills and,

3211
02:28:59,540 --> 02:28:59,930
and,
and,

3212
02:28:59,931 --> 02:29:02,730
and chop people up.
But swords back into Kona and days.

3213
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:03,810
No,
right.

3214
02:29:04,150 --> 02:29:07,190
You can't say it's completely.
Nobody would ask for that.

3215
02:29:07,191 --> 02:29:10,790
Nobody would create that in their own 
imagination for there for themselves,

3216
02:29:11,150 --> 02:29:16,150
so it's not,
it's not that you are completely in 

3217
02:29:16,150 --> 02:29:17,060
control of your destiny,
but it seems like you have at least some

3218
02:29:17,061 --> 02:29:20,140
sort of influence with energy and with 
your imagination and with,

3219
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:25,420
you know,
the things that you create and the 

3220
02:29:25,420 --> 02:29:26,690
environment that you set up.
I think that's one of the most important

3221
02:29:26,691 --> 02:29:29,000
things that I've ever learned from 
psychedelics.

3222
02:29:29,250 --> 02:29:29,970
Absolutely.
Yeah.

3223
02:29:30,330 --> 02:29:33,900
And just being in a mindset to try new 
things,

3224
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:36,900
whatever,
whether they're chemical or experiential

3225
02:29:36,901 --> 02:29:37,590
or whatever.

3226
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:41,430
I think cautiously try to consciously.
You're,

3227
02:29:41,431 --> 02:29:46,431
I mean obviously you didn't find out all
this information about it after you've 

3228
02:29:46,431 --> 02:29:48,550
tried all these things,
you knew that going in.

3229
02:29:49,630 --> 02:29:51,280
What's the one thing that you ever did?
We were like,

3230
02:29:51,310 --> 02:29:52,510
Oh boy,
here we go.

3231
02:29:52,990 --> 02:29:55,390
In what way?
This might be a slippery one.

3232
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:58,360
Ugh,
God.

3233
02:29:59,270 --> 02:30:00,430
Slippery one.
I mean,

3234
02:30:00,431 --> 02:30:04,450
I've had a few slippery ones in my day,
but uh,

3235
02:30:05,050 --> 02:30:07,330
I think a lot of the really potent 
psychedelics have,

3236
02:30:07,430 --> 02:30:11,890
have the ability to induce terror if 
you're too high of a dose.

3237
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:14,860
I've had that happen with both dmt and 
suicide than,

3238
02:30:15,210 --> 02:30:18,490
um,
so just so many,

3239
02:30:18,580 --> 02:30:23,580
so many different occasions,
but suddenly I've never had anything 

3240
02:30:23,580 --> 02:30:23,860
where I will actually have.
Yes,

3241
02:30:23,861 --> 02:30:28,861
I have,
I've had a few kind of close to what I 

3242
02:30:28,861 --> 02:30:31,861
would consider overdose of psychedelics,
where the dose is just so high that I 

3243
02:30:31,861 --> 02:30:32,770
think there might be some physical 
toxicity,

3244
02:30:33,940 --> 02:30:36,730
but,
but with those sorts of cases,

3245
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:41,440
it's very difficult to differentiate 
between what is motivated by fear.

3246
02:30:41,441 --> 02:30:42,190
You know,
a lot of people,

3247
02:30:42,191 --> 02:30:43,270
even when they're sober,
they'll,

3248
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:46,270
they'll panic or be uncomfortable and 
think they're having a heart attack,

3249
02:30:46,271 --> 02:30:48,850
but it's just a panic attack or it's not
even a panic attack.

3250
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:50,110
Um,
you know,

3251
02:30:50,120 --> 02:30:55,120
the mind is so informed by the body that
especially in a psychedelic state,

3252
02:30:55,331 --> 02:31:00,331
that it's very difficult to say,
what if you're drinking IOWASCA and 

3253
02:31:00,331 --> 02:31:04,291
suddenly your heart starts beating fast.
Is your heart beating fast because 

3254
02:31:04,291 --> 02:31:06,841
you're scared?
Are you scared because your heart is 

3255
02:31:06,841 --> 02:31:08,551
beating fast?
And which do you concentrate on the 

3256
02:31:08,551 --> 02:31:09,100
heart or the fear first in order to calm
yourself down?

3257
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:15,640
Yeah.
And you might be throwing a puzzle that 

3258
02:31:15,640 --> 02:31:16,280
you can't wrestle with.
It just runs you over.

3259
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:21,340
It's just too much.
And you're just there in utter fear and 

3260
02:31:21,340 --> 02:31:21,340
until it

3261
02:31:21,340 --> 02:31:21,960
slowly leaves your system.
Yeah.

3262
02:31:22,470 --> 02:31:24,740
I overdosed when I ate that one bad 
shroom trip,

3263
02:31:24,750 --> 02:31:25,890
you know,
like six months ago.

3264
02:31:25,891 --> 02:31:26,760
I mean,
I couldn't walk.

3265
02:31:26,790 --> 02:31:28,780
My legs would not work.
I,

3266
02:31:28,781 --> 02:31:29,940
they would.
They were failing.

3267
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:30,900
Well,
yeah.

3268
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:33,540
That's how he,
he got over seven grounds.

3269
02:31:34,390 --> 02:31:39,390
It was a lot too much.
And that's just a guest that was over 

3270
02:31:39,390 --> 02:31:39,420
seven.
It could be way more than that.

3271
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:40,020
You know,
you,

3272
02:31:40,040 --> 02:31:42,300
you're silly.
You went to hearts on not,

3273
02:31:42,470 --> 02:31:44,870
it's not unnecessary.
Yeah.

3274
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:46,260
Did you come back?
Well,

3275
02:31:46,650 --> 02:31:47,560
what'd you come back?
Fucked up.

3276
02:31:47,590 --> 02:31:48,990
Took me a while.
Like a day.

3277
02:31:49,330 --> 02:31:52,440
A good 24 hours after two.
I felt 100 percent.

3278
02:31:52,860 --> 02:31:54,780
But didn't you learn something from the 
experience?

3279
02:31:55,350 --> 02:31:56,620
Uh,
yeah.

3280
02:31:56,630 --> 02:31:58,760
My wall was like,
or my bathroom was like,

3281
02:31:58,770 --> 02:32:00,070
Tron,
the original tron.

3282
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:04,860
If you two had a conversation,
I'd say,

3283
02:32:05,010 --> 02:32:06,450
well,
which one of these is 24?

3284
02:32:06,820 --> 02:32:09,500
Which one is almost,
it's almost scary.

3285
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:11,760
How old are you now?
Thirty seven.

3286
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:12,990
Thirty seven,
37,

3287
02:32:12,991 --> 02:32:17,220
he's 37 and you're 24 and see that.
And he votes too.

3288
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:20,030
I took molly the other day and it,
molly,

3289
02:32:20,070 --> 02:32:25,070
Molly said the MTMA and it was a very,
I've noticed something recently doing 

3290
02:32:25,441 --> 02:32:29,460
shrooms and it happened for some reason 
with molly this last time.

3291
02:32:29,461 --> 02:32:31,980
So it makes me wonder how much of it was
really Mali.

3292
02:32:32,250 --> 02:32:35,760
But uh,
I could see so much better when I'm on a

3293
02:32:35,761 --> 02:32:36,570
psychedelic.
Like,

3294
02:32:36,571 --> 02:32:41,040
like it seems like my eyes were up 
because her pupils are bigger.

3295
02:32:41,041 --> 02:32:42,890
So you probably don't have that vision.
No,

3296
02:32:42,900 --> 02:32:47,900
I mean like brighter.
I mean everything's a lot brighter 

3297
02:32:47,900 --> 02:32:51,291
though.
Like I can almost see in the garden 

3298
02:32:51,291 --> 02:32:51,291
tools and it makes me.

3299
02:32:51,291 --> 02:32:54,580
And I had this thing I was thinking of 
like it would be weird if like all the 

3300
02:32:54,580 --> 02:32:56,400
shit that you see when you're 
showrooming is there all the time,

3301
02:32:56,670 --> 02:33:01,670
but your eyes adjust to the certain 
lightness or there's certain level of 

3302
02:33:01,670 --> 02:33:05,160
being open that you see it more when 
you're on shrooms.

3303
02:33:05,161 --> 02:33:10,161
So like,
like when you're seeing like you're 

3304
02:33:10,161 --> 02:33:11,961
looking at your hand,
you're seeing like this crazy shit all 

3305
02:33:11,961 --> 02:33:11,961
rounded like these,
like,

3306
02:33:11,961 --> 02:33:14,970
like minds that are growing over.
What if that Shit's there all the time,

3307
02:33:14,971 --> 02:33:19,971
but you're just focusing in on that 
layer of a brightness or if it was more 

3308
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:25,040
as we throw to you possible surveys,
one here qualified to answer that.

3309
02:33:25,810 --> 02:33:30,810
Uh,
I would say if I had an answer for you 

3310
02:33:30,810 --> 02:33:30,820
poppy cock,
it was just one of the things I thought,

3311
02:33:30,930 --> 02:33:35,930
wow,
I'm molly because I was looking like 

3312
02:33:35,930 --> 02:33:35,930
Jesus.

3313
02:33:35,930 --> 02:33:36,060
I can see in the dark right now.
Let's make a bet.

3314
02:33:36,061 --> 02:33:38,310
Let's make a bet because I say,
he says it's bullshit.

3315
02:33:38,370 --> 02:33:39,690
What do you say?
Oh,

3316
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:40,710
it's just a theory.
It's a.

3317
02:33:40,780 --> 02:33:43,800
What if no one knows.
I would probably say,

3318
02:33:43,850 --> 02:33:45,650
well,
it's your brain just shutting down.

3319
02:33:45,660 --> 02:33:48,150
Going crazy.
If I had to support your own thing.

3320
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:48,680
No,
no.

3321
02:33:48,810 --> 02:33:50,370
I'm just saying it's a.
What if I don't?

3322
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:53,190
I'm not just saying.
What do you think he would think?

3323
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:54,740
Oh,
I would say is even right.

3324
02:33:54,870 --> 02:33:57,650
I would say he would be exactly what he 
says on everything you know,

3325
02:33:57,651 --> 02:34:01,860
like he's takes the safe route,
which is what I do,

3326
02:34:01,861 --> 02:34:04,200
and it's like I'm not going to fuck.
He takes the scientific,

3327
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:08,280
the scientific route,
way more angels and Unicorns.

3328
02:34:08,440 --> 02:34:09,810
I'm looking for bigfoot,
Bro.

3329
02:34:09,811 --> 02:34:12,460
I'm always looking for bigfoot,
but I know I'm looking for bigfoot.

3330
02:34:12,510 --> 02:34:14,220
I know I really want big foot to have 
this,

3331
02:34:14,221 --> 02:34:16,140
but I don't think he does.
Right.

3332
02:34:16,350 --> 02:34:17,860
But I really want them.
You know what I mean?

3333
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:19,270
Right.
I mean,

3334
02:34:19,300 --> 02:34:21,970
you don't see any.
Nothing exists in the first place.

3335
02:34:21,971 --> 02:34:26,971
None of this is colored or has any.
Nothing actually looks the way we 

3336
02:34:26,971 --> 02:34:31,561
perceive it as a sensory phenomenon.
And so to say what things are actually 

3337
02:34:31,561 --> 02:34:33,790
like is already problematic because it's
a sensory experience.

3338
02:34:33,791 --> 02:34:35,290
So how you.
Yeah.

3339
02:34:35,291 --> 02:34:36,700
That is fascinating,
isn't it?

3340
02:34:36,701 --> 02:34:41,701
It's almost impossible for people to 
really wrap their heads up that your 

3341
02:34:41,701 --> 02:34:44,791
mind puts that red in that picture.
Your mind puts the dark and someone's 

3342
02:34:44,791 --> 02:34:44,791
hair,
your,

3343
02:34:44,791 --> 02:34:46,390
your,
your interpretation of the world.

3344
02:34:46,620 --> 02:34:47,560
I will,
you know,

3345
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:50,170
and then that's the total stolen talk.
Wonder Man.

3346
02:34:50,830 --> 02:34:54,700
It's like the color blue,
like what does it look like to you,

3347
02:34:54,701 --> 02:34:56,440
man?
When you see this guy,

3348
02:34:57,010 --> 02:34:58,040
what does it look like?
You do?

3349
02:34:58,041 --> 02:35:01,420
You really don't know.
We do know that it is different for some

3350
02:35:01,421 --> 02:35:04,360
people really different.
Well,

3351
02:35:04,361 --> 02:35:09,361
I mean there's this colorblindness is 
like linguistic relativity and color 

3352
02:35:09,361 --> 02:35:10,360
naming.
There's been a lot of scholarly research

3353
02:35:10,361 --> 02:35:15,361
into the issue where certain primitive 
societies have fewer names for colors 

3354
02:35:15,361 --> 02:35:19,200
and so they'll,
they'll only have black and white and 

3355
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:19,240
that will encompass black one.
Companies like red and blue and white,

3356
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:24,430
so it's not cross culturally defined in 
any way to.

3357
02:35:24,490 --> 02:35:26,210
It must suck to get your car painted 
there.

3358
02:35:26,790 --> 02:35:30,820
Can you car painted in the jungle?
Like I asked for blue.

3359
02:35:30,821 --> 02:35:32,120
This is red.
You fuck that.

3360
02:35:32,121 --> 02:35:33,160
Like same shit.

3361
02:35:37,400 --> 02:35:40,780
The end of the podcast.
We just all lost.

3362
02:35:40,781 --> 02:35:42,470
Complete total news.
Yeah.

3363
02:35:42,490 --> 02:35:47,490
Asm.
I don't even know how we got onto the 

3364
02:35:47,490 --> 02:35:47,770
subject of the color.
Where did that come from?

3365
02:35:47,800 --> 02:35:52,800
He was saying that he saw vines crawling
all over the interpretation of things 

3366
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:54,790
around us.
I love molly though and I think it's one

3367
02:35:54,791 --> 02:35:56,830
in this beautiful drugs ever.
Is it illegal?

3368
02:35:57,490 --> 02:35:59,140
Totally illegal by Joe.
Have you?

3369
02:35:59,270 --> 02:36:00,240
Have you done it?
No,

3370
02:36:00,290 --> 02:36:02,440
I've only done Mtma and I only did it 
work.

3371
02:36:02,570 --> 02:36:06,650
You take your wife to Hawaii,
you sit on the beach and you do two each

3372
02:36:06,710 --> 02:36:11,710
and you just sit there and you will 
fucking have the most beautiful time in 

3373
02:36:11,991 --> 02:36:14,240
the whole entire road and you're going 
to have a reset.

3374
02:36:14,390 --> 02:36:19,390
You're going to be so you and your wife 
are going to connect in a way that 

3375
02:36:19,390 --> 02:36:20,240
you've never had since you've started 
dating.

3376
02:36:20,241 --> 02:36:20,910
And it's,
it's,

3377
02:36:20,911 --> 02:36:22,370
it's,
it's gonna be amazing.

3378
02:36:22,590 --> 02:36:23,450
Well,
it's,

3379
02:36:23,451 --> 02:36:25,550
I highly recommend it more than 
anything.

3380
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:27,770
Why?
I love it.

3381
02:36:27,890 --> 02:36:30,620
It's like a little love bug.
Get Molly.

3382
02:36:30,650 --> 02:36:33,040
You will have the time of your life.
How much maurice,

3383
02:36:33,350 --> 02:36:35,810
you're a a young fellow.
Um,

3384
02:36:36,260 --> 02:36:40,940
how do you find a mate that can deal 
with any of this?

3385
02:36:41,030 --> 02:36:43,080
Talking in conversation?
How do you,

3386
02:36:43,110 --> 02:36:46,730
how you at 24 years old guy or girl,
I don't know if you're gay or straight,

3387
02:36:46,731 --> 02:36:49,340
but how do you find anybody to hang out 
with that?

3388
02:36:49,341 --> 02:36:51,040
You would,
you know that you're ready?

3389
02:36:51,310 --> 02:36:54,550
Start off looking in trees or chicks?
Well,

3390
02:36:54,560 --> 02:36:59,560
I'll tell you right now,
it's gonna be a tough conversation at 

3391
02:36:59,560 --> 02:36:59,640
dinner.
Well,

3392
02:37:00,380 --> 02:37:05,380
many people that are interested in the 
scientific element of a few close 

3393
02:37:05,380 --> 02:37:07,340
friends who are scientists who I talk 
with about this kind of stuff.

3394
02:37:07,400 --> 02:37:08,960
So when you date,
how do you,

3395
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,360
you know,
what did you do at work today?

3396
02:37:11,361 --> 02:37:16,361
And you started talking about feminine 
allylamines and all these different 

3397
02:37:16,361 --> 02:37:16,361
crazy shit.
Do you have girls?

3398
02:37:16,361 --> 02:37:18,650
Do their eyes glaze over or do they,

3399
02:37:20,260 --> 02:37:22,800
did they look to you for God?
I mean it depends on what their academic

3400
02:37:22,801 --> 02:37:23,940
background is,
but yeah,

3401
02:37:23,941 --> 02:37:28,941
I would say most people are not 
interested in that sort of thing unless 

3402
02:37:28,941 --> 02:37:31,761
you.
I'm trying to phrase this as high as 

3403
02:37:31,761 --> 02:37:33,410
possible without actually saying it,
but you must get mad amounts of stoner 

3404
02:37:33,410 --> 02:37:35,700
pussy thrown at you.
At least.

3405
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:38,650
Come on man.
You're like a.

3406
02:37:38,760 --> 02:37:43,760
you're an online stoner hero type.
Do they must just chicks boss launched 

3407
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:44,430
at you?
You don't use the twitter enough.

3408
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:49,640
I don't.
Maybe today's the day that I started 

3409
02:37:49,640 --> 02:37:51,270
Hamilton Morris one when that letter.
One name no space.

3410
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:53,680
Yeah,
he's got one tweet.

3411
02:37:53,770 --> 02:37:56,740
But if you're going to have one tweet,
this is the fucking tweet to have.

3412
02:37:57,250 --> 02:37:58,990
What was.
What was your tweet?

3413
02:37:58,991 --> 02:38:03,940
You have one amazing tweet.
What is your one tweet?

3414
02:38:03,941 --> 02:38:05,560
Do you remember?
None at the top of my head.

3415
02:38:05,561 --> 02:38:06,530
It's a pastor

3416
02:38:08,470 --> 02:38:11,360
second.
Trying to find it now,

3417
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:14,040
right?
I want you to talk one profile.

3418
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:19,880
Please vote for me on the shorter shorty
where it's got a desk dot TV and at the 

3419
02:38:19,880 --> 02:38:23,011
top of it click on phone for me and I'm 
getting beat by a wwe wrestler that has 

3420
02:38:23,801 --> 02:38:25,450
half a million hits.
I won't win,

3421
02:38:25,750 --> 02:38:28,210
but it just makes me feel happy that I'm
in second place.

3422
02:38:28,211 --> 02:38:30,690
At least Hamilton.
Mars only has one tweet and this is it.

3423
02:38:30,730 --> 02:38:35,730
In the realm of scientific observation,
luck is granted only to those who are 

3424
02:38:35,730 --> 02:38:35,730
prepared.

3425
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:39,070
That's romantic.
You can have one quote by the way.

3426
02:38:39,071 --> 02:38:41,770
I think that quotes kind of hacky.
There's A.

3427
02:38:41,771 --> 02:38:43,450
There's a couple of versions that are 
out there.

3428
02:38:44,020 --> 02:38:45,160
You know,
somebody,

3429
02:38:45,190 --> 02:38:46,750
somebody fucking gangsters,
quote.

3430
02:38:48,070 --> 02:38:50,160
Luck is only granted those prepared.
You know,

3431
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:53,830
success is when luck meets preparation.
It's like an old.

3432
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:56,260
That's the oldest quotation ever.
They just,

3433
02:38:56,261 --> 02:38:57,970
Dr that shit up.
It made it fancy.

3434
02:38:58,570 --> 02:39:01,210
They made it sound a little profound.
Little more profound,

3435
02:39:01,211 --> 02:39:04,750
but really basically they dug,
they dot an old saying a Fox,

3436
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:08,320
but if you're going to have one quote,
that's it dude.

3437
02:39:08,680 --> 02:39:13,680
And I like,
I didn't even use quote marks or didn't 

3438
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:13,680
use it.
Period though.

3439
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:15,670
You used the period maybe should be 
attributed to someone,

3440
02:39:15,671 --> 02:39:17,080
but it's easy enough.
Yeah,

3441
02:39:17,081 --> 02:39:18,310
they should figure it out.
Right?

3442
02:39:19,070 --> 02:39:23,980
You didn't write that yourself.
Did you fade away like Def Leppard?

3443
02:39:24,320 --> 02:39:24,960
I don't know.

3444
02:39:24,980 --> 02:39:26,440
Did he say that?
Hamilton Morris.

3445
02:39:26,470 --> 02:39:28,590
This has been our worst podcast we've 
ever had,

3446
02:39:28,591 --> 02:39:31,270
but it's only because of us.
Really.

3447
02:39:31,271 --> 02:39:33,700
You were amazing.
Every time we called upon you,

3448
02:39:33,701 --> 02:39:36,180
your questions were great.
We just got Brian a little two.

3449
02:39:37,050 --> 02:39:40,570
It's two stones and it threw us off a 
little.

3450
02:39:40,810 --> 02:39:42,310
But uh,
it was fascinating,

3451
02:39:42,311 --> 02:39:42,880
man.
You,

3452
02:39:42,881 --> 02:39:44,800
uh,
you don't have to turn the music.

3453
02:39:46,060 --> 02:39:48,000
Let him pump up his shit right now.
It's going to put.

3454
02:39:48,070 --> 02:39:49,220
Um,
so if,

3455
02:39:49,221 --> 02:39:50,950
if people want to watch any of your 
stuff,

3456
02:39:51,020 --> 02:39:53,530
um,
it's Hamilton's Pharmacopia.

3457
02:39:53,980 --> 02:39:54,600
That's right.
Yeah.

3458
02:39:54,620 --> 02:39:59,620
That's what it is.
And Vice magazine and then vice 

3459
02:39:59,620 --> 02:39:59,620
magazine.
Copia on VBS.

3460
02:39:59,620 --> 02:40:01,630
Was there any one site that's the best 
place to access all your stuff?

3461
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:06,160
A vice is the main place.
I usually post new things on my blog.

3462
02:40:06,161 --> 02:40:08,470
Also Harper's magazine,
so they should google it.

3463
02:40:08,471 --> 02:40:13,471
Right.
But not today because Google's down 

3464
02:40:13,471 --> 02:40:13,520
bitches is.
Wikipedia is down

3465
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:17,460
the protesting Sopa they're trying to 
take it folks.

3466
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:19,290
They know.
They know the end is near for them.

3467
02:40:19,440 --> 02:40:24,440
They know you're good for hillbrow 
people for big corporations like Google 

3468
02:40:24,440 --> 02:40:28,140
and that in a wikipedia for standing up 
for this shit.

3469
02:40:28,260 --> 02:40:29,340
Well,
I heard it's dead.

3470
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:32,460
I heard the bill is dead as it stands,
but they're going to try to rework it.

3471
02:40:32,790 --> 02:40:34,200
I don't know.
It's terrifying.

3472
02:40:34,240 --> 02:40:36,120
This is.
It must terrify you mean you.

3473
02:40:36,121 --> 02:40:38,790
You're on the Internet constantly and 
you're doing illegal shit.

3474
02:40:39,390 --> 02:40:40,950
Yeah,
I mean it could have some employee.

3475
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:45,600
The idea that they can just come in and 
take down your site at their discretion,

3476
02:40:45,930 --> 02:40:50,930
and this was right after the Nda,
a a national defense authorization act 

3477
02:40:50,930 --> 02:40:52,290
passed,
which is another terrifying thing to.

3478
02:40:52,300 --> 02:40:54,000
Could just arrest you.
They don't have to have a warrant.

3479
02:40:54,390 --> 02:40:56,130
Just we were wearing weird times,
man.

3480
02:40:56,190 --> 02:40:58,650
They're coming after your dual cassette 
recorders guys.

3481
02:40:59,300 --> 02:41:01,200
They're coming after your flashlight,
so by another one.

3482
02:41:01,230 --> 02:41:03,300
Go to [inaudible] dot net and click on 
the link for the flashlight,

3483
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:06,540
codenamed Brogan,
and you'll get 15 percent off the number

3484
02:41:06,541 --> 02:41:08,340
one sex toy for men,
Hamilton.

3485
02:41:08,341 --> 02:41:09,090
Morris,
if you want,

3486
02:41:09,091 --> 02:41:11,580
I can have some shipped to you.
You don't have to say anything on air.

3487
02:41:11,581 --> 02:41:13,320
Just wink twice.
You're good.

3488
02:41:13,321 --> 02:41:14,880
Okay.
Shipment on the way.

3489
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:17,850
No worries.
So the effect of masturbation product.

3490
02:41:17,851 --> 02:41:19,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's a weird subject.

3491
02:41:19,950 --> 02:41:23,000
It's much like psychedelics.
It's really underappreciated.

3492
02:41:23,570 --> 02:41:26,490
It's physical maintenance,
I think.

3493
02:41:26,550 --> 02:41:31,550
I think it's good.
The body needs to be able to breathe as 

3494
02:41:31,550 --> 02:41:31,940
often as possible.
And uh,

3495
02:41:32,140 --> 02:41:37,140
that's too distracting.
You don't want to involve all these 

3496
02:41:37,140 --> 02:41:37,140
different people in your life and have 
sex with them.

3497
02:41:37,140 --> 02:41:37,140
Get yourself a flashlight.
Kids.

3498
02:41:37,170 --> 02:41:39,990
It's not that expensive.
They last a long time.

3499
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:43,290
As long as you don't do what Brian does 
them and fixed them,

3500
02:41:43,950 --> 02:41:46,110
turn them inside out shows going on 
anyway.

3501
02:41:46,140 --> 02:41:49,050
Go to [inaudible] dot net and click on 
the link for the flashlight and enter in

3502
02:41:49,051 --> 02:41:51,940
the code name Brogan and you're good for
furniture for number one.

3518
02:42:34,980 --> 02:42:37,650
That's the simplest way because vice,
they do awesome shit,

3519
02:42:37,651 --> 02:42:42,651
but it's crazy trying to go to that site
and navigate it and try to find 

3520
02:42:42,651 --> 02:42:43,680
anything.
If anybody wants to come to Chicago,

3521
02:42:43,681 --> 02:42:48,681
tickets are almost sold out.
That is a the 27th and it's with me Joey

3522
02:42:49,590 --> 02:42:52,110
Diaz and Duncan trussell.
That's the Chicago theater.

3523
02:42:52,111 --> 02:42:53,880
Friday,
January 27.

3524
02:42:53,881 --> 02:42:58,881
That's going to be fun.
It's fun because then the next night 

3525
02:42:58,881 --> 02:43:00,860
it's UFC on Fox Hamilton.
Thank you very much for being on one of 

3526
02:43:00,860 --> 02:43:03,450
our most awkward podcast ever,
but you were a delight to talk to.

3527
02:43:03,451 --> 02:43:05,970
You're a wealth of information and a 
cool motherfucker.

3528
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,430
Thanks a lot buddy.
Thanks for having me.

3529
02:43:07,460 --> 02:43:09,390
All right folks,
we will see you next week.

3530
02:43:09,391 --> 02:43:11,440
That's it for this week to get some 
sleep.

3531
02:43:11,770 --> 02:43:13,330
Oh yeah.
And the Ice House.

3532
02:43:13,850 --> 02:43:16,060
Um,
I've had no sleep for days.

3533
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:16,880
I'm so.
I'm,

3534
02:43:16,890 --> 02:43:21,890
so.
I've never been more out of it doing a 

3535
02:43:21,890 --> 02:43:21,890
podcast ever.

3536
02:43:21,890 --> 02:43:21,890
Um,
my,

3537
02:43:21,890 --> 02:43:23,170
my little girl's been throwing up and no
sleep at night.

3538
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:25,210
And coming from Brazil,
I'm a mess.

3539
02:43:25,270 --> 02:43:27,850
So if I sound half retarded today,
I will bounce back.

3540
02:43:27,940 --> 02:43:31,120
I promise you,
next week I'll be strong.

3541
02:43:31,180 --> 02:43:36,180
I'm going to take some Alpha brain and 
some fresh squeezed juice and want to 

3542
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:36,670
get the party started.
So see you guys next week.

3543
02:43:36,690 --> 02:43:41,690
Um,
I think Greg Fitzsimmons is doing this 

3544
02:43:41,690 --> 02:43:43,620
sweet and uh,
I think Brian Cowen was due as well and 

3545
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:43,620

3551
02:43:59,020 --> 02:44:00,610

going to be a big surprise,

3552
02:44:00,611 --> 02:44:03,060
but it definitely has Bryan County.
