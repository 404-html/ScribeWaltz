1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:04,500
You know,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,730
I got a new bit about,

3
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:06,270
uh,

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,970
seeing a couple of fucking in
the hotel room across from me.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,613
Yeah.

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,150
So I won't do the bit,

7
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:13,410
but I'll tell you the story,

8
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,550
which is basically nears,

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,450
even Portland.

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,360
The hotel is like a horseshoe shape.

11
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:22,200
So I'm on the 10th floor and I look
across into a room and the curtains are

12
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:22,441
open,

13
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,274
lights are on,

14
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,480
chick is on her back,

15
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,171
legs up.

16
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:30,171
And this dude who's ripped his fucking
hour dinner and I'm just standing there

17
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:32,460
looking at him like,

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,790
like this is the greatest thing I've
ever greatest things ever happened.

19
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,240
I got,

20
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,390
I slept my bag in my hand
and I'm just transfixed.

21
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,351
And He,

22
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:40,800
uh,

23
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,700
keeps fucking,

24
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:45,730
I'm like high five and the
glass like go man had then.

25
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,440
And so I had the curtain closed
cause I didn't want them to see me,

26
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,300
but I popped my head through the curtain.

27
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,890
I looked like a photographer
from the 1930 [inaudible]

28
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,870
and then I start thinking
about what am I sound like?

29
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:06,070
And this is where it gets creepy,

30
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,830
creepy year is I leave my room,

31
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:13,831
I walked down the hall and I stand outside
the room and I listen and I hear him

32
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:15,240
grunting and I hear her go,

33
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,573
oh,

34
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,451
to my room,

35
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:20,510
and I call the room.

36
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,310
No,

37
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,270
just watching them,

38
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:22,901
waiting,

39
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:23,330
waiting,

40
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,550
and he didn't pick up.

41
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,301
But if he did,

42
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:26,134
I would have been like,

43
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,350
yeah.
