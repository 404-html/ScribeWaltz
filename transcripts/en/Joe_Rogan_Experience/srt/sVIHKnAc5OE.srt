1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Boarding start to broadcast Shazamm 
you've gotten really good at this job.

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,550
A fucking goddamn wizard.
This shit.

3
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:10,680
Now son,
I know exactly how to do it.

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:14,980
I get that shit up and running.
A lady's John,

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,350
welcome to,
uh,

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,310
this has got to be like our twelfth real
podcast or something like that.

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:25,311
I can't believe I've kept it up this 
long and it's all because you fuckers 

8
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:29,580
because that's awesome.
Here we go.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,210
It's all because of you people.
Positive energy that I get from you 

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:35,520
guys.
And all the,

11
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:40,521
uh,
all the people that I run into on the 

12
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:40,521
road,
let's say they loved the podcast,

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,800
keeps me doing it.
So we're going to keep doing it and it's

14
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:44,880
fun as fuck,
you know.

15
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:47,400
And uh,
it's on itunes now.

16
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:50,400
You can get it on itunes.
I think it's just Joe Rogan podcasts.

17
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,280
That would have been.
Yeah.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.
The one that has the most ones.

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,860
There's a couple other ones that,
uh,

20
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:58,110
other people have created,
but this is the real one.

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,230
There's lots of people have noticed that
they've taken straight up bits and put 

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,770
it on your,
on itunes and put underneath the podcast

23
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:06,240
name and get on.

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,200
You know,
my attitude about the Internet is always

25
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:12,450
that the Internet,
you know,

26
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,720
you can't,
um,

27
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,060
can't put any energy into trying to take
your shit down because uh,

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,970
especially as a comedian,
it's inconvenient sometimes.

29
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:26,971
Like I go places and people have already
seen bits that aren't out on anything 

30
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:28,300
yet and they've seen it because somebody
youtube did and then,

31
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:30,100
you know,
Stan hope has a whole bit about,

32
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,410
you know,
how people will put your shit on Youtube

33
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,540
and it's not done and the waistband hope
works.

34
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:38,740
And the way I work with both work real 
similar in that we have an idea and it's

35
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:42,130
never like totally done.
You keep adding to it and tweaking it.

36
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,800
And then when you put it on a recording,
at least there,

37
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:46,120
it's kind of done,
you know.

38
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,270
But oftentimes like I'll put something 
on a recording and then like a week 

39
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,910
afterwards or two weeks or even a month 
later,

40
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,380
I have a better tagline.

41
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,000
So before the,
before the things,

42
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:57,340
even on television,
I have like a new better way to do it,

43
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,710
you know,
but somebody wants said to me that you 

44
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:02,980
got to look at standup comedy as like 
every performance is just,

45
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,680
they,
they're just capturing a moment in time,

46
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,790
which is true once you've got some good 
stuff out there,

47
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,520
but it's not true if you don't have 
anything good out there.

48
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,460
So if you don't like until like shiny,
happy Jihad.

49
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,020
I was not happy with any of my stuff.
I would do it.

50
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,180
And I was like,
oh,

51
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,530
sorry.
Like when I did that,

52
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:22,120
2005,
uh,

53
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,070
the one that's just called Joe Rogan 
live,

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,200
when is out of print with no,
the one that was from the Netflix shows 

55
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,420
from Netflix that uh,
we didn't.

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,860
Phoenix when I was doing that,
I was doing the man show,

57
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,690
UFC comedy and fear factor at the same 
time.

58
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:42,190
I was doing all of them at once and I 
was frazzled and it was just like,

59
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,930
it wasn't my best performance.
Like I wasn't a.

60
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,200
like when I,
when I look at it,

61
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,790
I say,
I think that I'm like tents.

62
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:52,090
I'm not like enjoying myself.
So I think,

63
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,390
you know,
but that's that one I consider like 

64
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,941
that's a moment in time like that at 
least it was better than the stuff that 

65
00:02:59,941 --> 00:02:59,941
I had before.
You know,

66
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:00,120
my,
my

67
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,160
first CD,
I liked some of the bits but it's like 

68
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,160
my delivery was kind of fucked up back 
then.

69
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,140
But now I looked at it,
you know,

70
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,750
I looked at the stuff that's out now.
It's like,

71
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:12,751
you know,
every now and then someone can like 

72
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:13,630
videotape something like before way 
before it becomes anything,

73
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,960
you know,
like you'll video tape me just talking 

74
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,671
shit onstage and then you know,
it'll become a bit somewhere down the 

75
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:22,010
line.
But you know,

76
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:24,250
most times someone,
if I go to a show somewhere,

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,250
if they're a fan of download my shit,
they might've already seen the premise,

78
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,740
you know what I mean?
And it might not be as fun for them.

79
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:30,430
You know,
it's like,

80
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,010
so it's like you could look at that,
it,

81
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,370
it hurts you,
but I don't think it does.

82
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:39,870
I think having stuff out on the Internet
that people enjoy is always good.

83
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,000
That's the big problem though with 
everything like now like tv shows,

84
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:45,630
other like Hulu and stuff like that.
But you have to find out how to.

85
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,720
They want to share it.
They want to do that,

86
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:50,020
that concept,
but they also need to make a profit from

87
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:55,021
it,
which is kind of interesting how they 

88
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:55,021
have to go about doing it.

89
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:55,021
Yeah.
It's like I think we're,

90
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:57,690
we're experiencing a whole new model and
I think uh,

91
00:03:57,691 --> 00:04:02,691
your attitude about how your fans get 
your stuff is very important.

92
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,950
It's very important because it 
represents how you feel like as a 

93
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,221
performer and like what you feel the 
relationship that you have with 

94
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:12,221
audiences,
you know.

95
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,150
And if I was like this greedy dude that 
was like,

96
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:14,870
you know,
fuck them,

97
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:16,670
they got to fucking pay.
You don't want my fucking money.

98
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,530
Like if you really,
if you really think like that,

99
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:22,850
like these people are just like you and 
be fucking honest man.

100
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:25,310
If you were 18 years old and you a 
broke,

101
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,950
you gotta fucking download Shit,
you're just going to do it.

102
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:31,040
It doesn't mean you're not a fan.
I mean sometimes you broke,

103
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,280
you know,
and I think is if you have people,

104
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,560
you know,
I think if you have a certain attitude 

105
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,381
about like what you do and that attitude
is that you're just trying to create 

106
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:46,130
things and you're trying to make money 
off of it,

107
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,280
but really trying to create things that 
people are going to enjoy.

108
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,280
Like that's the most important thing.
It's not that making money saying it's 

109
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,790
the money will come if you work and if 
people enjoy your work,

110
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,910
they're going to support you.
People are going to come to see your 

111
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,191
shows,
they're going to buy dvds if they have 

112
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:03,191
the money,
they have the money.

113
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:04,190
Like if I like there's a band that I 
really liked out,

114
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:08,120
download their shit online like on 
itunes and then I'll buy a CD to,

115
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:10,550
to play in my car just because I want to
support them.

116
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:13,010
Just got to really enjoy them.
I don't need.

117
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:15,380
I could hook my ipod up to my car,
but I will.

118
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,780
I will spend that money because I want 
to support them.

119
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,450
Any movie that's good.
Even if I'm not gonna,

120
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,920
watch the DVD.
I buy it.

121
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,140
I always buy it.
If I enjoyed it in the movie theater,

122
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:29,141
I buy it and I feel like I'm supporting 
artists when I do that and I feel like 

123
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,100
that's what people got to do to that.

124
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,440
The Internet is a crazy new thing,
man,

125
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,200
you know,
and I think it's going to.

126
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,190
We're going to get to this weird point 
where.

127
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,340
See Right now it's just information,
you know right now the ability to send 

128
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,570
information.
It's pretty profound and like how,

129
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,470
how our world has changed,
but it's only information right now.

130
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,470
Eventually it's going to be more than 
information when they come up with.

131
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,750
I was talking to cliff,
he be my friend cliff from EPA Games.

132
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,990
He's the coolest.
Cliffy B is the dude.

133
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,580
He's the main man behind gears of war,
the whole series of them,

134
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:03,470
the unreal games.
Super,

135
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:05,670
super cool dude.
Like a really fun guy.

136
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:08,530
And he came to my comedy show and then 
um,

137
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,630
he came,
we came to the UFC afterwards and then 

138
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,391
we even hung out.
He came to the after party and we were 

139
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:18,551
talking,
he was a super cool guy and we were 

140
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:18,551
talking about,
um,

141
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:22,630
the,
the ability eventually of making 

142
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,271
printers that can print up things like 
that's like really what's going to 

143
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:25,271
happen eventually.

144
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,840
Kind of real.
Yeah.

145
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,680
Printers that can make,
they can make some,

146
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,410
he was talking about three d models that
they can make with these,

147
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,620
but they're going to get to a point and 
it's not that far off where you say if 

148
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,581
your mouse breaks,
you're going to be able to go to this 

149
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:45,410
computer printer thing and you're going 
to be able to put in the combinations.

150
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:50,411
So whatever the fuck you have to say to 
get a mouse or download a mouse program 

151
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,070
and a mouse is going to fucking appear 
in your.

152
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:57,071
I mean,
you're really gonna be able to make 

153
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:57,071
things with a printer,
you know.

154
00:06:57,071 --> 00:07:00,131
And remember the first printers that 
were old and clumsy and fucked up and 

155
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:03,170
slow.
Then I have this new epson.

156
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,230
It's just like 100 bucks or something,
maybe a hundred 50 bucks.

157
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,620
The fucking thing is like lightning 
pages just flying by.

158
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,910
You can print,
you can print it from the road.

159
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:15,050
You can call it up.
I mean,

160
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:17,210
it's insane.
There's programs that you can.

161
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,750
You can get on your God damn iphone.
We could print it up from your computer.

162
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,830
My old apartment just somebody had a 
wireless printer and they just had an 

163
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,610
open,
so I'd sit there and find the biggest 

164
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:29,880
goat cifo get with herpes and I'll throw
it in,

165
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,920
print it on their printer,
stopped 50 pages and it never went away 

166
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,170
and in fact printing successful.
That's also funny how much you that that

167
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,180
happened.
You could pretty much go through any 

168
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,180
neighbor there and get on somebody's 
printer and do that.

169
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,910
It's so fun.
Just take your laptop.

170
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:47,890
Gives me three plus hotspot.

171
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,020
That's obvious.
You could wreck some marriages like 

172
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,071
that.
If you knew a dude who had a parental 

173
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:56,071
like that,
you could send him.

174
00:07:56,071 --> 00:08:00,180
Just doctored up photoshop pictures of 
him blowing dudes or you could start 

175
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:07,191
with photoshop him like marriages.
You know?

176
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,480
That's the golden rule.
That's the other golden rule about the 

177
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,701
internet.
If there's a picture of you on the 

178
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:14,701
Internet,
someone,

179
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:15,340
someone their photoshop to dick in your 
mouth,

180
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,970
for sure.
Not many,

181
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,560
many dicks broken shore.
If there's a photo of you,

182
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,260
there's a dick in your mouth.
It's probably one year,

183
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,420
but there's sticks all around you.
There's so many dicks.

184
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:30,421
Have me pictures with Dick's online.
Just this one guy flap has done like a 

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,860
thousand of them.
Right?

186
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,960
You know,
it's always me and just dicks 

187
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:36,960
everywhere.
All over the place.

188
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Totally.
Oh,

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,280
have you ever seen how a dildos are 
made?

190
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:41,260
And uh,
like a asshole,

191
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,480
you know,
we could buy like a girls.

192
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,400
I haven't seen how they're made,
but I've seen them.

193
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,190
But you're fucking something that's 
supposed to be a girl's body

194
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,300
dude.
They have people that sit there and 

195
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,941
paint veins and veins,
like the Mexican ladies and they the 

196
00:08:55,941 --> 00:09:00,830
first day wiped his coat and they sit 
there and have to stroke it for like an 

197
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,070
hour and that does under vein.
So it looks like the skin underneath the

198
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,390
veins underneath the skin didn't have a 
car,

199
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,630
they let that dry.
Then they have this person that just 

200
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:11,670
does the purple ones,
but that's significant game veins.

201
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,370
Like the ones that have the main blood 
flow to the tip of the Dick,

202
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:19,371
kind of smart.
It is the most creepiest thing that if 

203
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:23,541
you look there and you feel like 
somebody getting murdered and you're 

204
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:23,541
watching it,
but it's just people making dildos.

205
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,780
It's.
And then when they cast her,

206
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,460
it's so true though.
It is like,

207
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,600
well what is it?
Why is it creep us out so much to see 

208
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:31,600
like bodies,
like the idea of bodies.

209
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,330
I don't know because it's,
I don't know.

210
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,400
It's terrible.
It's like body parts and stuff.

211
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,820
It's terrifying to people.
And then when they make a cast,

212
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:41,100
like if they have fucking Ron,
Jeremy come in there and they're like,

213
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:46,101
all right,
we're going to do a chubby deal with 

214
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:47,391
that.
This week they had to put his dick in 

215
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:50,511
like this tube.
Almost like when you ever see like a 

216
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:50,880
horse,
they're trying to get sperm from a horse

217
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,881
to make babies or something like that.
They have to like Jack it off into this 

218
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:57,090
tube and they had the same thing with 
uh,

219
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,270
how they have to sit there with this 
plaster and he can't touch it.

220
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,820
He has to stay hard for five minutes.
He can't,

221
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,180
he has to have his girl or another,
like a porn star girl to sit there and 

222
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,801
whisper like I want you to have a whole 
oh your balls balls and do it for five 

223
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,850
minutes.
You are the least sexy chick ever.

224
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,150
Do these sexy imitation of a chick and 
history.

225
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:23,370
And I didn't care if I was in jail for a
year,

226
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:24,960
I wouldn't fuck you.
Like a burden.

227
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,970
But yeah,
it's fucking crazy.

228
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:31,971
And then with the cast they just have to
like put plaster in your fucking vagina 

229
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,130
and just fucking sit there for five 
minutes and they pull up this thing and 

230
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,100
then they don't,
they don't just play paste hair on it.

231
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,370
They actually have to.
So with a thread and needle every single

232
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,180
hair on the pussy,
that's ridiculous.

233
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,700
Go to a dildo factory.
I think there's one in studio city.

234
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,830
You got to take a trip there with a 
camera or something.

235
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,430
I think they would let you.
That they did for Hbo Sixty years ago.

236
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,780
Yeah,
but dates hbo.

237
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:59,781
I'm just a comedian.
I don't know if they would do it just 

238
00:10:59,781 --> 00:10:59,781
for a regular dude,
unless they were like UFC fans.

239
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,790
Dude the UFC.
But they think they would want to like 

240
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,010
show people if you let them get with the
basic.

241
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:10,200
No,
he would never do that $100,000.

242
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,870
I'm not getting a boner in front of any 
dude.

243
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,200
No,
no,

244
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:13,530
no,
no.

245
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,030
People are doing all of the scientists 
like shut the fuck up.

246
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,880
That would be weird though,
because that's what was after in this 

247
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:25,880
video.
I saw that the porn star.

248
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,200
I did it just.
There was a box of his dick's.

249
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,570
He comes up and hilarious.
My Dick time.

250
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,470
$500.

251
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,950
What a great idea though because people 
are such freaks.

252
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,740
They watched someone fucking a video and
they want to be like that person.

253
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

254
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,330
It's so weird.
I want to get one just to see what it's 

255
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:47,490
like.
They have ones now.

256
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,410
Crazy,
Huh?

257
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,780
Yeah.
What,

258
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,250
what,
what kind of a human

259
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,410
being thought that up?
The first guy.

260
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,500
A really good warranty priest.
Let's just get someone and we'll make an

261
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:03,790
exact mold of their body so we can fuck 
it.

262
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,930
Yeah.
How crazy is it?

263
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,700
This,
this new thing about the.

264
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,940
The priests.
You know what's happening that they're a

265
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,640
equating there.
Them being persecuted for kid fucking to

266
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:18,730
the Holocaust and the pope say going to 
save them all.

267
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,220
That's what they're saying to south 
park.

268
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,590
Let's talk about that.
What is going on?

269
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,160
Like how crazy is the Catholic religion?
The fact,

270
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,920
the fact that it's still around is mind 
boggling,

271
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,990
but the fact that anybody takes him 
seriously,

272
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,120
are all these fucking kids get molested?
Like how many kids have to get molested 

273
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,320
before someone steps in and goes,
oh,

274
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:40,390
maybe these guys aren't directly tied to
God.

275
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,440
Like maybe,
maybe,

276
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,030
maybe.
Maybe we've been fooled.

277
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,460
Right?

278
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,750
I mean,
it's just amazing that a cult can have 

279
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,021
so much power in 2010 and and that 
nobody wants to call it a cult and 

280
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:56,851
everybody wants to pretend that there's 
something sacred about it because it's 

281
00:12:56,851 --> 00:12:57,850
been around forever.
Like it's the craziest,

282
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,940
most fucked up idea ever.
And there was a big discussion about it 

283
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,130
on our message board and one of the most
interesting arguments was so people were

284
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:09,100
saying,
you're your discounting all the positive

285
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:14,101
work that the Catholic Church does,
but I'm saying anything positive that 

286
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:14,101
they do,
well,

287
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:18,751
they do charities or that's,
that's them doing things outside of 

288
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:20,890
religion that doesn't have anything to 
do with the fucking religion.

289
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,170
That's just people doing charitable 
things.

290
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,290
That does not make up for kid fucking.
That does not make up for living a life 

291
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,581
filled with guilt so they can control 
you and keeping you down like a little 

292
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:32,581
bitch.

293
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:35,470
Terrified about every fucking thing you 
do because you're going to burn in hell.

294
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,840
And anybody who's ever been a Catholic 
school knows that.

295
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,480
Yeah.
I did a year in Catholic school,

296
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:42,760
man,
and it was like I did a year in jail.

297
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,610
My first grade,
first grade I went to Catholic school,

298
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,230
Our Lady of chest,
Jehovah,

299
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,280
and uh,
in,

300
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,350
in New Jersey and this fucking cunt nun,
sister Mary Josephine.

301
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,760
I was like a pretty happy kid before 
this happened,

302
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,120
you know,
my parents had just broken up and the 

303
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,520
impact of it hadn't hit me yet,
you know,

304
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,660
but I was still in denial,
you know,

305
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,930
but I would see my dad's still because 
we were still in New Jersey.

306
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,880
And then while this was going on,
I went to Catholic school for a year and

307
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:15,790
it was horrifying.
It was brutal.

308
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,940
Dude.
This nun was such a fucking cunt.

309
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,370
Everything,
everything you did,

310
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,460
she would just be on you.
She will tell you she's going to make 

311
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,910
you sit on a nail and the closet,
she's going to have to stay overnight.

312
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,740
And she was just as haggard old bitch 
that nobody loved.

313
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,470
Nobody had fun with her.
Nobody told jokes to her.

314
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,100
She never danced.
She never supposedly never fucked,

315
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,140
you know,
she wasn't allowed to do shit.

316
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,640
She was just the worst representation of
an elderly woman.

317
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,670
Possible.
The best would be a woman who's lived a 

318
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,401
life of joy and she's just super 
friendly to everybody because she feels 

319
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:53,401
so blessed

320
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:54,460
that she made it through this.
This is great.

321
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,000
This fucking con.
She used to hit us.

322
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:04,001
She really used to hit us like people 
think like Catholic school teachers 

323
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:04,001
don't hit you with rulers.
No,

324
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,570
they fucking hit you with rulers,
but that's real shit.

325
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,390
They'll smack you in the head.
It was brutal.

326
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,570
I was.
Every day was terrifying,

327
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,900
but I got awesome grades.
It was that crazy.

328
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:19,160
Like right after that.
I fell off school hardcore often that my

329
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:24,161
was in gifted classes and everything.
The next year after a Catholic school 

330
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:26,390
and then I totally stopped trying and I 
was sleeping.

331
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:31,391
I just.
I stayed up all night and just when 

332
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:31,391
you're in a Catholic school,
you're so terrified.

333
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:35,000
You will push the everything.
You don't want to have a fucking see.

334
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,620
You don't have a big.
They'll yell at you.

335
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,390
They're monsters,
man.

336
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,860
You know?
I mean,

337
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,190
it's just that whole idea as a 
philosophy is the worst idea possible.

338
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,250
That means you're putting the control of
your consciousness.

339
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,370
You're putting your trust in the wisdom 
of someone who lives in a cult of kid 

340
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,700
fuckers.
Really?

341
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:56,750
I mean,
look at that.

342
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,780
So that's what's going on.
A bunch of guys aren't allowed to fuck 

343
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:01,780
women.
Oh,

344
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,360
that's real natural.
What,

345
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,550
what?
You're not allowed to have sex do.

346
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:09,551
You don't even.
They don't even get a better place in 

347
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,891
heaven when they go to heaven.
They just get regular heaven just like 

348
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:11,891
you.
If you listen to them,

349
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:14,930
it's ridiculous.
It's the dumbest fucking idea ever.

350
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:20,590
The dumbest idea ever.
And we have to pretend unlike CNN and 

351
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:25,031
Shit,
that this is like a real issue of 

352
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:25,031
debate,
you know,

353
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:25,550
and they'll,
there's abuse in the Catholic church,

354
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:30,551
but it's never like,
why the fuck do we still have the 

355
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:30,551
Catholic Church?
It's never.

356
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:34,010
Nobody ever steps in and goes a really,
really all this,

357
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,130
these fucking guys in their robes and 
they fuck kids and they live in these 

358
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:39,680
crazy places together.

359
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,690
All men really.
And the,

360
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:47,691
the nuns are all evil.
And they all look haggard and beaten 

361
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:47,691
Dab.
Oh,

362
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:49,520
a few of them do some charity work.
They do some good things to.

363
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:52,370
They donate some of the millions of 
dollars.

364
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:57,371
They trick people into giving them.
They'd donate some of that and they do 

365
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:58,010
some good things.
But yet you never really hear about this

366
00:16:58,011 --> 00:16:59,690
shit.
And like the amish religion.

367
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,220
Catholicism is one of the worst ever.
The Catholics were controlling the 

368
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,220
world.
We'd be fucked.

369
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,490
You mean everybody wants to fight off 
the Muslims.

370
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,140
At least the Muslims like the other 
Muslims,

371
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:14,290
Muslims like each other.
Catholics don't even like each other 

372
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,721
though.
They're fucking controlling you with 

373
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:16,721
death,
you know,

374
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:20,010
that's a crazy religion.
I guess Muslims if you believe in like,

375
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,740
you know,
the hardcore jihadists,

376
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,510
I guess they do to,
you know,

377
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,920
it's pretty similar.
You know,

378
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:27,820
cat Catholicism,
the only thing that has over over the,

379
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,010
the Muslims says you don't hear about 
Catholics who said bars as much.

380
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,320
It's more rare.
Sure.

381
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:34,160
It's happened though,
right?

382
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,570
It's been Catholic suicide bombers.
Right.

383
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,690
You never see a Buddhist cock sucker.
You know,

384
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,550
you never Buddhist.
Yeah.

385
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:46,010
You're never going to be scared to be in
a tent in the middle of the woods with a

386
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:51,011
Buddhist guy.
You're not going to think he's going to 

387
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:51,011
fucking rape you.
You're going to guys to protect me.

388
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:52,160
Instead.
A real Buddhist though,

389
00:17:52,161 --> 00:17:55,040
people will argue that a real Catholic 
wouldn't fuck kids too.

390
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,380
Yeah.

391
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,490
No,
and I think maybe that's just a former 

392
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:00,490
retards and like to be around each other

393
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,870
happened.
I don't know what you know,

394
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,680
and people say,
Hey,

395
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:06,110
you guys talk about the subject of 
religion a lot.

396
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,830
Like it comes up a lot,
shouldn't it?

397
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,490
Yeah.
What's all about?

398
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:15,491
What the fuck?
It's programming and then that's really 

399
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:19,691
all it is.
No one knows anymore about what life is 

400
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:20,390
all about and you do.
I mean,

401
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,000
we have wisdom,
we've learned things.

402
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,250
You know,
all of us have had different life 

403
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,771
experiences that we've benefited from.
We try to express these to each other 

404
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:30,170
and we can all get a little smarter in 
the process,

405
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,830
but the reality is nobody really knows 
what the fuck is going on and nobody 

406
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,250
knows where this is going.
Nobody has any idea what this is,

407
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,380
you know this itself,
if this,

408
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,410
if we live this life,
this life would be the craziest drug 

409
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,170
trip ever.
Okay.

410
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:48,650
If you had some sort of a logical two 
dimensional life,

411
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:53,651
like a binary life,
like something you could read out on a 

412
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:53,651
piece of paper.

413
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:55,640
If that was life and that life was 
introduced to this life right here,

414
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,190
you would go,
this life is psychedelic,

415
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:01,940
this is insanity.
So everything is insane and it gets more

416
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,800
ridiculous by the minute,
you know,

417
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:08,801
I mean,
there'll be fucking CNN headline news 

418
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:08,801
and they'll have a,
a,

419
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:08,801
an,
you know,

420
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:11,450
an episode on him is Kim Kardashians 
asked too fat.

421
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,340
I mean,
they literally will do that.

422
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:13,800
I mean,
you know,

423
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,820
this is where we're at this tiger woods 
shit and this Jesse James Shit and all 

424
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,250
this crazy stuff where we're 
concentrating on,

425
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,130
on nonsense,
you know,

426
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:27,131
I mean,
we're so much more concerned with 

427
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:27,290
dancing with the stars than we are,
but the fact that we're in the middle of

428
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,000
two fucking years

429
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,440
wars grazing,
we have too much info about Demi Moore.

430
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:37,441
We have too much info about these 
current Dashi and people that would 

431
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:40,861
normally not know about unless you rode 
a horse in the town and somebody told 

432
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:40,861
us.

433
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:42,260
It's so fascinating that it's so 
fascinating,

434
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,000
isn't it?
I mean,

435
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:47,390
we are the weirdest animal ever.
If you didn't,

436
00:19:47,391 --> 00:19:50,570
if people didn't exist and you made them
up,

437
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,090
it would be too much.
There you go.

438
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,300
This is ridiculous.
They can't be that fucked up like fucked

439
00:19:56,301 --> 00:20:01,301
up and they figured out nuclear weapons 
that fucked up and they can fly through 

440
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,840
the air to all parts of the planet 
there.

441
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:05,660
That fucked up.
God Damn.

442
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,270
They're really having a conversation 
with the pope.

443
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,750
He's a fucking cult leader.
Like,

444
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:14,120
why are you sitting down with them?
This is ridiculous.

445
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,050
And they're like,
yeah,

446
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:16,280
well,
you have to play along with them.

447
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:21,281
No,
you don't have to play along with them 

448
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:22,601
because playing along with them is a 
concession that what they're saying is 

449
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:25,901
legitimate.
They really represent something 

450
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:25,901
meaningful.
It's nonsense.

451
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:27,650
The individuals inside that 
organization,

452
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,330
they represent something meaningful.

453
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:34,330
They're individuals.
They're just trapped in this web of 

454
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:34,520
ideology.
They're trapped in this thing.

455
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,640
They know I'm a Catholic,
I was born Catholic and the Catholic 

456
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:39,640
like,
you're a fucking human.

457
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:44,770
Why are you lumping yourself in 
voluntarily with this gigantic group of 

458
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:49,030
people who believe nonsense?
That doesn't make any sense and no one's

459
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:54,031
saying that.
Anybody else has the answers like I'm 

460
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:56,701
not saying I'm right and you're wrong,
or I know I have some information you 

461
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:57,340
don't have.
I don't know anything or you know,

462
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:02,341
I have my own life that I can tell you 
honestly what I've learned from my 

463
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:04,180
experiences and things that I've read 
that other people have researched,

464
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:07,490
but what do I really know about what the
fuck this is and what's next?

465
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,440
Nothing and I know as much as anybody 
and you know as much as anybody.

466
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:16,650
There's not a single person who has more
of an more of a realistic view of the 

467
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:18,400
next phase of existence.

468
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,020
Whether it exists at all.
No one knows and it doesn't help.

469
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,920
Pretending you do know.
That's what fucks everybody up with,

470
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:31,921
fucks everybody up is someone that 
pretends they do know because then we 

471
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,600
with our fucking monkey instincts,
just follow that guy and I'm like,

472
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:35,200
well,
he knows.

473
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:37,140
He knows.
He's so confident and this guy,

474
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,160
of course he's confident.
All these people are listening to them.

475
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,110
First of all,
he's crazy and then all these people are

476
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,970
listening to them and so the more people
listen to him,

477
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:47,971
the more he believes his own bullshit 
and the more he really thinks he is 

478
00:21:47,971 --> 00:21:51,181
special and ordained and there to give 
the word of the Lord and the more but 

479
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:51,181
delusional they become.
I mean it's a,

480
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:52,960
it's a fucking classic Jim Jones 
pattern,

481
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,330
you know?
I mean that's what it is,

482
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:59,350
is it's the,
the idea is completely ridiculous that 

483
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,900
some guys who don't get pussy have the 
answers.

484
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,380
Nobody has got the fucking answers and 
there should be no ideologies like this.

485
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:12,901
This should be no predetermined patterns
of behavior that are attractive to 

486
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:17,611
follow because anything predetermined 
like that is gonna fuck you up because 

487
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:19,540
it's not going to give you a realistic 
map of the world.

488
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,690
You live in your map of the world.
Back when people had very little 

489
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:24,820
information,
when Catholicism was created,

490
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:26,980
the map of the world was,
there was no internet.

491
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,030
There is no,
you know,

492
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:33,031
in an exchange of ideas,
there's no pornography available and 

493
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:36,391
you're fucking iphone anywhere you look.
I mean there's so many things that are 

494
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:39,781
different about that world than about 
this world and so all their crazy 

495
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:40,050
nonsense,
you know,

496
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,140
could be easily disproved if somebody 
tried to start up that religion today,

497
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,460
you know,
it's just,

498
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:50,461
but it's there and it's been there 
forever so people just fucking stick 

499
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:50,461
with it.

500
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:51,820
It's the weirdest thing ever.
Like logically,

501
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,920
religion is one of the weirdest things 
ever.

502
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,140
It's so hard to believe it's still 
around.

503
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,500
You really got stopped watching.
Lost at the wrong time.

504
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,900
It wouldn't fucking getting really 
intrical religion.

505
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,860
Yeah.
Well maybe I'll tune in.

506
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,920
I still got a minute.
I'm confused now.

507
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,200
You probably know religion a lot more 
than me.

508
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:13,630
I really like do and I don't,
I don't.

509
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:18,631
I know,
I know Sir enough to get annoyed and 

510
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:21,301
then when I started researching it more 
becomes more and more cookie and then 

511
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:24,991
then I can't take it anymore.
So I only know surface details of like 

512
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:28,591
all religions,
but all I know about all of them as 

513
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:28,591
they're all ideologies,
you know,

514
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,790
any,
anything like that as dangerous.

515
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:34,120
Anything where you've got older people,
when you grow up with these older people

516
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,350
that are telling you what,
what,

517
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,410
what's what you should and shouldn't do.
They don't know.

518
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,380
You know,
at best you know,

519
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:45,950
we exist really well in small tribes,
but I think

520
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,020
when,
when people are in small tribes,

521
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,210
those small tribes are so important to 
stay alive.

522
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:55,211
These people have this intense bond of 
family and I think what happened with 

523
00:23:55,211 --> 00:23:58,571
human beings is we went from small 
tribes to gigantic countries so fast,

524
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:05,020
you know,
over the course of just a few thousand 

525
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,020
years.
And I don't think our,

526
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,071
our body caught up with that.
I don't think our body has separated 

527
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:10,310
itself from the fact that,
you know,

528
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,100
we really are all connected,
you know,

529
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:18,101
I think in the small tribes when they 
were looking out for each other all the 

530
00:24:18,101 --> 00:24:21,341
time,
it was really like having a giant 

531
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:23,681
family,
but we don't feel connected as a 

532
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:23,681
country.
You know,

533
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:27,011
I don't,
I don't feel connected with all the 

534
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:27,011
Americans,
you know?

535
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:28,240
That seems ridiculous.
There's 300 million of us.

536
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,250
So like how,
how can anybody connect to everybody 

537
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:33,920
back then they could.
And that's how we're wired.

538
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:39,100
We're wired for that kind of life.
I think that's why so many people are 

539
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,221
depressed.
I think people were depressed because 

540
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:45,161
the energy in their life is imbalanced 
because they don't have enough love and 

541
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:45,161
compassion.

542
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:46,500
It's all about their life.
It's all about.

543
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:49,320
It's all about you need to just feel 
love.

544
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:54,000
You don't need negative things.
It's like if you were on a plane and you

545
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:57,390
hear like a screaming kid right next to 
and you're trying to sleep,

546
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,910
you know now might be different from you
because you know,

547
00:24:59,911 --> 00:25:04,911
you have kids now,
but in the old days it used to just 

548
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:05,190
drive.
You want to just fucking knocked the kid

549
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:06,840
out or something crazy.
It doesn't draw me.

550
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,900
It doesn't bother me at all anymore.
It's like,

551
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,080
it was like comforting.
Yeah,

552
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,670
I like it.
I liked kids.

553
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,760
What if I started crying?
What would have slapped you in the 

554
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,870
waterfalls?
On your ass?

555
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,540
I went waterfalls on you the other day.
Brian gets bottled up.

556
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,270
It's funny.
I do once the once a year.

557
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,310
No,
I can give.

558
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,200
I can cry in movies and Shit,
man.

559
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,560
I cried in that Jeff bridges movie.
Crazy heart.

560
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,620
Oh really?
Oh,

561
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:42,621
I don't want to see that then.
I don't want to say I grew up a 

562
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:42,621
motherfucker

563
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:43,980
got me a couple times.
They've gotten a couple times.

564
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,880
There was a spa one,
especially because it was about a little

565
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:50,430
kid,
a little kid getting lost.

566
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,430
I don't want to tell you anymore.
No,

567
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,330
I won't say anything.
Anybody.

568
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,770
I don't want to give away anything about
the movie,

569
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:59,520
but if you haven't seen it so bad ass,
I'll run it on my ipad tomorrow.

570
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,440
Did I use it?

571
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,730
No.
One is more of a technology junkie then 

572
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,131
this motherfucker.
And if you have ever seen his youtube 

573
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:12,650
page,
it's let's find Jesus,

574
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:13,310
right?
Uh,

575
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,060
let's.
Yeah,

576
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:16,730
Youtube backslash.
Let's find Jesus,

577
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:18,130
but it's got a red band back on.
Yeah,

578
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,880
I got a red band.
Dark Red Roll up there.

579
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:24,930
Again,
if you're ever thinking about getting 

580
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,831
any kind of a camera or anything,
check out his reviews because he's like 

581
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:30,011
the most thorough.
He's the biggest tech head I know and I 

582
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:34,060
don't know anybody who is more of a 
junkie of technology and more also more 

583
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,820
knowledgeable like you're always on the 
ball.

584
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:41,110
So many people giving shit on this ipad 
and you are a little bit of an apple 

585
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,110
fan.

586
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,930
I am an apple fanboy.
Know why?

587
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,130
That's why they're giving you shit.

588
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,640
You're excited.
They're really hating that you're 

589
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:49,640
excited.
You know,

590
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,870
it's when you see what gets tricky,
not when you praise and object,

591
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:55,130
but when you start shitting on like the 
kindle kid was dead,

592
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,130
fucking cute and then people's defend 
their kindle and they get crazy.

593
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,190
You know,
now I'm not an apple fan.

594
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,930
Boy,
bullshit.

595
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,260
So many cameras.
I love so many cameras.

596
00:27:05,261 --> 00:27:10,261
I liked the company.
I like to support something that I 

597
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:10,261
believe in.
I think they're the best.

598
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,340
I love their little portable cameras 
with the IPAD,

599
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,920
but what's crazy is before I was kind of
like tricking myself,

600
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:15,220
like,
yeah,

601
00:27:15,221 --> 00:27:17,440
I just want to get netbook this is 
better than a netbook.

602
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,010
I'm ready to support this thing.
But then lately they've been showing all

603
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:23,770
these applications and I'm like,
like they have netflix now,

604
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,860
so I'm going to teether Internet from my
cell phone and be able to watch netflix 

605
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,720
anywhere I want to throughout the united
slugging them,

606
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,180
Hey,
this was losing his marbles.

607
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,010
I'm not.
I'm tired of people.

608
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:41,011
I'm just going to live.
I'm living in my fucking technology 

609
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:41,260
road.
It's fucking great.

610
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,480
It's so funny because if you were forced
to live your life in front of a computer

611
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,950
and then someone allowed you to go 
outside,

612
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,620
you'd be so happy to go outside.
Right.

613
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,680
You know,
it's because we're forced to live in 

614
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:54,680
reality that the computer life seems so 
much more interesting.

615
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,270
It seems more like it like I'm supposed 
to.

616
00:27:57,271 --> 00:28:02,271
I'm looking for something we always 
talked about and that's why Google is 

617
00:28:02,271 --> 00:28:05,661
one of my favorite websites because I'm 
searching for something always 30 

618
00:28:05,661 --> 00:28:08,601
percent of them do and that's the best 
thing about my message board when I go 

619
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:08,601
to that message board everyday I'm 
looking,

620
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:09,600
what do you got?
What's going on?

621
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,980
What's happening?
What am I looking for?

622
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:15,981
I don't know.
I will click links and so literally 

623
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:15,981
sometimes I'm nodding out to fucking 
keyboard.

624
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:16,450
You ever do that?
Yeah.

625
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,630
I'm like nodding out keyboard.
You sitting there.

626
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,240
Usually I,
I'm,

627
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:25,470
I'm supposed to be writing and I just 
start surfing the Internet and then next

628
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:27,240
thing you know I'm,
I'm not now and then I'm like,

629
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:29,250
what am I dealing with?
Kind of retarded mind.

630
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,620
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
I just keep checking,

631
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:37,010
I'll be ready to go to bed and then I'll
just say let me get online real quick 

632
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,010
and see what's going on in the world

633
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,210
and you go to the same websites over and
over waiting for that one

634
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,480
almost or something like,
you know what man,

635
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,640
it's pretty bad ass as a comedian 
though,

636
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,930
there's never been a better time to be 
able to promote your gigs so much better

637
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,480
than it's ever been before because you 
know you can,

638
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:52,330
you can get information out there and 
you know,

639
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,970
you can,
you develop like a whole network of your

640
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:55,670
fans,
you know,

641
00:28:55,671 --> 00:29:00,671
and on your twitter page and your 
message board and people get to know 

642
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:00,671
you,
like the real you.

643
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:03,730
It's not like the old days you would do 
like an interview,

644
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,790
you know,
like somebody like Dean Martin or 

645
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:08,790
something like that,

646
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:08,790
you know,
was a kid with a bell going.

647
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,120
Yeah,
I mean how do you get someone to show us

648
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,750
what they know about you is like you 
would do like the Ed Sullivan show.

649
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,590
I know you go on stage and do like seven
minutes.

650
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,070
That's all you got mad right now.
You could,

651
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,350
you know,
I was telling Ari like we were,

652
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:27,351
were already,
who was a very funny guy as sometimes 

653
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:28,680
has a hard time getting gigs on the road
and I was saying you should put together

654
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:29,790
something,
you know,

655
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:34,791
where you,
you do your best bits that you've ever 

656
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,371
done and do and throw them up on youtube
because he has a lot of bits it doesn't 

657
00:29:37,371 --> 00:29:40,581
even do anymore because he's got new 
bits and it might be you don't have 

658
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:41,090
those old bits like in a video you 
should make.

659
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,360
Make a video of your shit man,
you know,

660
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:44,410
and put that on Youtube.

661
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,820
I go,
you've got really good bits,

662
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:51,060
you know,
looked at the gay bar bed and like 

663
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,310
there's a bunch of bits of the ads that 
are really classic fits it doesn't do 

664
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:53,310
anymore.
And I'm like,

665
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,790
take those put,
just throw them up on youtube man.

666
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,980
And then people see it,
they'll come see you at shows.

667
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,290
It's really the best method.
It's like,

668
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,900
you know,
the old method of like you would do like

669
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,310
a comedy central show.
Yeah,

670
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:04,540
I mean,
yeah,

671
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:09,541
I guess like some those stand up sit 
downs or you know what a premium blend 

672
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:10,870
or something like that.
There's like seven people in each.

673
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,060
You know,
there's like A.

674
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,320
I don't know how many is each shows that
an hour,

675
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:15,220
half an hour.
What is it?

676
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,960
How many comics go up and a premium?

677
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,040
Yeah,
our.

678
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,020
I think it's like for comics or 
something like that,

679
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,520
people don't really.
They remember,

680
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,300
Oh,
there was that guy.

681
00:30:22,301 --> 00:30:27,301
He was kind of funny,
but if they could just go to fucking 

682
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:27,301
youtube anytime they want.
Like,

683
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:27,301
oh,
I thought this was funny,

684
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:28,300
I'm going to send it to your friend.
Do Listen,

685
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:30,290
this guy's hilarious.
And then he says it is right.

686
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,080
If that's what happens,
it just gets going.

687
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:37,140
Itunes is insane to me.
The other day I was trying to tell my 

688
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,420
friend that his song.
I'm like,

689
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,440
no,
you got to hear the song.

690
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:38,950
Damn.
And I'm like,

691
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,210
Oh yeah,
I have an iphone.

692
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,540
Downloaded it right into in a minute.
I purchased it,

693
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,420
download it,
and with a Bluetooth it to my stereo and

694
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:47,400
my car.
That's fucking.

695
00:30:47,401 --> 00:30:49,000
I was like,
this is like a jukebox.

696
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:54,090
I have the best shoe box ever.
It's nuts that just that idea is crazy 

697
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,140
and that shit's going to be in your car 
and it's going to be voice activated.

698
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,590
You gonna be able to press a button and 
say,

699
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:02,970
go to itunes and download rollingstones 
tattoo you.

700
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,410
Bam.
That shit's gonna.

701
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Have you seen the demos of the new 
photoshop cs five or six or whatever it 

702
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,780
is,
the new feature in it.

703
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,440
I'll do it.
It's on your message board.

704
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,430
Look under like new photoshops and on 
the main form,

705
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,520
but I.
it's smart fixing.

706
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:22,040
So can you take a picture?
There's a treater is a shadow.

707
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,980
There's a glare.
There's somebody in the way of you.

708
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,340
You just circle it and cut it and what 
it does,

709
00:31:28,341 --> 00:31:31,280
it looks around it and tries to make its
own scene.

710
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,150
So you're just sitting there like trig 
on Blair gone shadow gone.

711
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,240
It just like you have a brand,
like it does all the hard work that took

712
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:41,270
like hours and hours.
There's going to be the fake his photos,

713
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,160
you know,
photos are going to be real anymore.

714
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,670
Like pretty soon every photo you take,
like you can zoom into your face,

715
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,770
just a rate cut at wrinkle and I'll 
take,

716
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:53,820
make her skin grow back.
Like we'll find out what your skin 

717
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:53,820
textures.
You just see the video demo.

718
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,830
It's so crazy.
So yeah,

719
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,890
for those completely gone nap,
we're going to go to the moon

720
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,020
10 times next year.

721
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,510
It really is getting very strange.
Technology is getting very strange.

722
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,770
It's,
it really is.

723
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:13,771
Getting to have this weird point,
and we've talked about this before and 

724
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:14,860
I've been talking about onstage lately.
There used to be that people,

725
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,730
and I wrote about this in my blog,
that when when they invented something,

726
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,010
it was to make their life better.
You know,

727
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:26,011
you the,
the first cavemen invented putting a 

728
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:26,011
sharp stick,
you know,

729
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:30,520
you know,
poor appointed rock at the end of the 

730
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,481
stick.
So like it's kill Santa and then they 

731
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:34,891
invented a pot so they could take the 
meat and put it inside and carry it 

732
00:32:34,891 --> 00:32:34,891
easier.
And then they invented all these.

733
00:32:34,891 --> 00:32:39,590
It made their life easier.
What the fuck does the large Hadron do

734
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,250
to make your life easier?
Tag It looks awesome.

735
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:48,310
It looks.
It looks like the biggest robot 

736
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,390
rollercoaster ever.
They need to make a movie in there too.

737
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,950
Two in there.
Can you imagine that?

738
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:57,010
Just to think of the idea behind it.
We are going to send Adams around a 27 

739
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:03,620
kilometer circle,
a giant machine and to build up speed.

740
00:33:03,621 --> 00:33:08,621
Did they get to like just below the 
speed of light and they slam into each 

741
00:33:08,621 --> 00:33:09,050
other.
What the fuck?

742
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,960
That's awesome.
How is that trickling down to anybody?

743
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,740
I mean is there anything at a particle 
physics that trickles down to to make 

744
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,120
life more convenient for people at 
anything?

745
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:24,050
I mean you're talking about like the 
biggest scientific project in history.

746
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,260
There's 10,000
different scientists from 100 countries 

747
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,700
and it's cost billions and billions of 
dollars and I'm not criticizing it.

748
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,970
Don't get me wrong because somebody said
something about this like,

749
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,360
how could you attack science?

750
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,260
You know,
they're trying,

751
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:39,020
they're doing what they're trying.
I'm so not criticizing.

752
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,280
I am.
Oh,

753
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:45,281
I am not.
I'm not on one side of the other and I 

754
00:33:45,281 --> 00:33:48,001
don't.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

755
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:48,001
with them doing this.
I'm just completely fascinated by it.

756
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:52,510
I am so fascinated by the idea that 
they're trying to recreate the 

757
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:57,041
conditions right after the big bang and 
that's what they're looking for and 

758
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:01,271
that's why they're doing this.
And probably something weird that it 

759
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:01,271
would trickle down to like storage and 
power,

760
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:04,770
like battery life is ridiculous like 
that.

761
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,120
We're figuring out how to save power and
energy.

762
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:10,890
I mean maybe because they are making a 
corrosion.

763
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,010
Yeah.
So it might be something weird like that

764
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,160
or it could be something game,
you know,

765
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,680
it could,
it could trickle down.

766
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:20,681
I guess.
I mean know who they'll be known for is 

767
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:20,681
to say not that smart.

768
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:24,400
I mean when,
when things get really wonky is when 

769
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,320
they really figured out how to crack 
time when they figured out how to travel

770
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:28,850
through time,
you know,

771
00:34:28,851 --> 00:34:31,610
and there's been like,
there's a model to this,

772
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,850
uh,
this fucking this scientist,

773
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:37,850
I think his name was Kurt or Dale was 
like,

774
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,920
what else goes with the double?
Oh,

775
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:40,670
what is that called?
UHM,

776
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:42,800
lot.
Anyway,

777
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:45,860
he was this guy who figured out that if 
you could,

778
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:50,830
you'd have to take a cylinder half the 
size of the solar system and spinning at

779
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,610
the speed of light.
You have to cross it out.

780
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:56,990
I don't,
I don't remember exactly what the fuck,

781
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,620
you know,
the,

782
00:34:57,621 --> 00:35:00,350
the formula was for it.
But if you did that,

783
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:05,410
if you actually created this thing that 
was half the size of the solar system 

784
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,230
moving at the speed of light somehow or 
another,

785
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,540
you actually could your lack of time 
like it is possible.

786
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,390
Like what the fuck?
What if,

787
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,450
what if they figure out something along 
those lines.

788
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:19,451
Because the thing about people is we're 
not gonna be satisfied with just the 

789
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,751
large Hadron collider.
It's not like they're going to figure 

790
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:25,151
this out.
They're going to create the Higgs Boson 

791
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:25,151
particle and they go,
wow,

792
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:25,151
here we got it.
You know,

793
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:27,170
we did create the God particle and we,
we know that it's real.

794
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,540
What we know they're going to come.
There's going to be another thing is 

795
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:32,540
going to be the going to try to get 
crazier.

796
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:37,510
We think we can make a black hole.
Well if you think you'll make a black 

797
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:37,510
hole,
let's not do it.

798
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,100
Well we don't know if we can make a 
black hole,

799
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,620
but we think we can make and we think 
it'll go away really quickly.

800
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:45,510
Like what?
That's their fucking with everything.

801
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,350
No one.
You know,

802
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,740
I thought I like a lot that we talked 
about recently.

803
00:35:48,741 --> 00:35:52,160
I always keep on going back to your 
thinking is like how,

804
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:57,190
what if all this creek,
because lately I haven't had a lot of 

805
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,190
crazy stuff go on in my life and I was 
like,

806
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,781
what if me and you in the future like 
iphone 50 or changing the past,

807
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,050
you know like,
Hey,

808
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,480
what do you want this month?
You want to,

809
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,520
you know what I mean?
Like we're creating our own past using 

810
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:09,520
technology,
like changing time.

811
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,140
Remember when we were talking about like
how weird would that be?

812
00:36:12,141 --> 00:36:14,450
Like if we could sit there now and go,
okay,

813
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:16,570
we can go back to 1989.
Oh you're,

814
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:18,830
you're eating pizza here.
Do you want something crazy to happen?

815
00:36:18,831 --> 00:36:20,090
Were you eating pizza here?
Yeah.

816
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:22,950
Let's just throw in this crazy world,
right?

817
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,950
Because like lately it just seems like 
all right,

818
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:29,951
this is like a.
because a lot of stuff that's happened 

819
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:32,081
to me,
it seems like it's so insane that that 

820
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:32,081
doesn't even seem real.
Like I'm waiting for a reality show.

821
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:33,080
Cameras to come out.

822
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,580
Yeah.
I don't know man,

823
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,370
you know,
I,

824
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:40,371
I've often thought that there's a path 
that you're supposed to live in life and

825
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:44,540
then path will sort of illuminated 
itself to you as you go along the way,

826
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:46,310
as long as you pay attention to your 
instincts,

827
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,880
you know,
and uh,

828
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:52,881
I think a big part of that path,
it's like your attitude in life and how 

829
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:53,510
you,
how you view things and how,

830
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,240
how you,
how you feel about yourself,

831
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,470
how you feel about life.
Right?

832
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,540
And I think in,
in as much as you can kind of dictate a 

833
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:06,101
lot of that,
you can kind of decide how you view the 

834
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:06,101
world.
You can kind of decide your,

835
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:08,930
your approach to things and you can 
decide based on your instincts.

836
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:13,931
And I think if you do that,
then everything kind of just works out 

837
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:13,931
as great way.
It's weird,

838
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:18,310
you know,
as long as you're doing the right 

839
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,751
things,
it's like you have to really be a 

840
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:19,751
positive person.

841
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:22,840
You have to really be disciplined so you
don't feel like you're slacking off on 

842
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,150
all of the things that you should be 
working on.

843
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,640
And there's like,
there's a certain balance,

844
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:30,790
there's a certain guiltiness that you 
feel when you don't work hard enough at 

845
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:30,790
something that's there for a reason,
right.

846
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:35,830
It's not necessarily you can get that 
out of your life just by doing what 

847
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:35,830
you're supposed to do and it feels 
better.

848
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,160
You don't feel like you're self 
defeating and the process,

849
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,540
you know,
I think,

850
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,760
I think there's,
there's a path to life,

851
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:45,761
dude.
And I think if you might think of very 

852
00:37:45,761 --> 00:37:45,761
being controlled by us in the future 
using technology.

853
00:37:45,761 --> 00:37:47,230
So that was our theory,
right?

854
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,390
Right.
I think maybe that is a possibility.

855
00:37:50,391 --> 00:37:51,320
I mean,
who the fuck knows?

856
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:56,410
But I think what's more likely is that 
every person sort of as ridiculous as 

857
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,850
this sounds,
that every person's sort of fits into a,

858
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,810
a peace in this world and that this 
world,

859
00:38:02,811 --> 00:38:06,560
everything about it from bottled water 
to fucking space shuttles,

860
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,880
that it's all connected.

861
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,630
And then it really is.
Even though it seems like life,

862
00:38:11,631 --> 00:38:14,000
like we think of it as just life,
that's what we've labeled it.

863
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,620
Oh,
here's life on the world.

864
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,720
Here's all these people going about 
their day,

865
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:18,380
here's,
you know,

866
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:21,290
a boat on the water.
We think about it like that.

867
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,980
But really all these things in this 
life,

868
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,440
everything,
they all have a value.

869
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,380
They all have a position,
they all have a purpose.

870
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,560
And it really is like what we're living 
in is we're living a gigantic 

871
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:41,101
mathematical equation.
And I think that that's what all human 

872
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:41,770
life,
animal life,

873
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,860
when wind and fucking earthquakes and 
everything,

874
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:49,861
I think it's all a part of this insane 
mathematical equation and that chaos in 

875
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:53,470
life.
And you know,

876
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,220
earthquakes and meteor impacts,
these are all built into this equation.

877
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,340
This is how the system works.
This is how the system works.

878
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:05,340
It seems like this crazy randomness,
this fury of nature and you know,

879
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:10,611
and birth and death and you know,
and sexuality and creativity and you 

880
00:39:10,611 --> 00:39:12,070
know,
why was my childhood so bad?

881
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:14,870
And you know,
why was I raised in a wealthy family now

882
00:39:14,871 --> 00:39:16,180
on lazy,
you know,

883
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:18,190
all these different,
these different things.

884
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:22,300
They all play like a little park and 
this giant fucking equation.

885
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:27,301
It's just so big we can't see it and so 
crazy and alien because it is us because

886
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:32,851
it is the world we live in.
It's almost impossible for us to really 

887
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:33,290
see the big picture.
You know?

888
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:38,340
I think that's very possible,
very possibly what we're doing in this 

889
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,791
world.
I think all of us are living a giant 

890
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:45,091
mathematical equation and I think it 
probably has something to do with 

891
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:45,130
technology.
I mean,

892
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:50,190
no one treats that like,
like it's a serious possibility because 

893
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,150
it's the subject of terminator movies,
you know,

894
00:39:52,151 --> 00:39:57,151
but if you looked at what's going on,
you would see that technology is 

895
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,620
increasing at a much faster rate of 
evolution and human beings and if 

896
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:10,620
essentially what we're capable of doing 
as a human being is made calculations 

897
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,880
and move and make decisions and you 
know,

898
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,870
and have moral code and a judgment in 
your mind.

899
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,200
I mean you could fucking program or 
religion into a computer and it would 

900
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,550
actually follow it.
You know,

901
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,580
you could give a computer a personality,
you could force a computer to react a 

902
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:26,620
certain way,
the different things.

903
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:31,830
Then you figure out a way.
It's a put a computer so small that you 

904
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,390
put it in an artificial body that you've
created with your fucking computer.

905
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,480
And the next thing you know,
you have computers making life and that 

906
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,030
life is a computer and that computer is 
living,

907
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,120
you know,
it's own version of this mathematical 

908
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,731
program.
That's just as possible as us being a 

909
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:47,750
part of a mathematical program.
Right?

910
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,700
You know,
it's,

911
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:51,460
it's all very possible that,
you know,

912
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,210
we are here to create technology and 
then our,

913
00:40:54,211 --> 00:40:57,220
our whole society is geared towards 
creating technology.

914
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:03,180
The fact that like in China,
do you know how fucked up the pollution 

915
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:03,180
isn't?
China?

916
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,950
It's insane.
They had this one city,

917
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:08,310
I forget what it is.
I think VBS TV did a,

918
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,910
uh,
a documentary on it.

919
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:14,990
This is one city where it's so bad there
that just breathing the air is like 

920
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,410
smoking three packs of cigarettes a day.

921
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,810
It's pretty bad here too,
Joe.

922
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:25,230
The other day I was coming or driving to
my house and you can even see burbank 

923
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:25,720
because happened to small.

924
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,300
Yeah.
That is bad.

925
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,960
And we just breathe it in every day.
It's not bad where you live,

926
00:41:29,961 --> 00:41:31,550
but it's like

927
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,980
camp good for you.
It's

928
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,470
clean air.
That's one of the reasons.

929
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:35,510
Yeah.

930
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,410
Well I wanted to move to Colorado,
you know,

931
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,210
I wanted to get away from this 
overpopulation

932
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,500
Austin,
Texas.

933
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,560
Well,
everybody says that though,

934
00:41:43,561 --> 00:41:45,150
but that's why everybody's moving to 
Austin.

935
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,950
You know,
I certainly think that places that are,

936
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,590
uh,
have less people are nicer.

937
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,800
We were in Charlotte,
North Carolina this week for the UFC and

938
00:41:55,021 --> 00:41:57,960
uh,
people in Charlotte are so fucking nice.

939
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:03,020
That's my second place.
I would move South Carolina or North 

940
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,020
Carolina,

941
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,020
Charlotte,
North Carolina.

942
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,990
And the people were so fucking cool.
Everybody was friendly.

943
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,300
Everybody was normal,
you know,

944
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:11,000
it was like,
it was a really nice place.

945
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,960
People were really nice though.
Everybody in restaurants and bars,

946
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,660
it's like there's less people.
People are more down home.

947
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:18,950
They're more friendly,
you know.

948
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,000
It was a good time.
Yeah.

949
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:27,100
This ain't the best way to live.
New York is where we were just at and 

950
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,110
there was,
there was more interesting thing because

951
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,200
we went from New York to Charlotte,
North Carolina and Charlotte.

952
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:33,740
North Carolina is way better.
I mean New York Yasmar restaurants.

953
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:34,070
Yeah,
yeah,

954
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:35,600
yeah.
There's more stuff to do definitely.

955
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,730
But there's also more tension.
There's also a,

956
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,410
you know,
the dealing with the overpopulation,

957
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,350
dealing with traffic.
You just like,

958
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:49,390
everybody's on edge.
I don't want to live somewhere where 

959
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:49,390
everybody's on edge,
you know?

960
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:49,940
Yeah.
It makes,

961
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,310
it makes people a little bit.
Some people more creative.

962
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,400
It makes.
I think it makes for more interesting 

963
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:57,400
people,
you know,

964
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,221
more people in the east coast are way 
more interesting to me that people on 

965
00:43:00,221 --> 00:43:00,221
the west coast there were way funnier to
me.

966
00:43:00,221 --> 00:43:04,970
Yeah.
Isn't it weird that the left sides of 

967
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:04,970
the United States is more dangerous than
the right side,

968
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:10,130
but yet the right side as the angry or 
people than the left side when it comes 

969
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,170
to like the east coast versus West.
Mostly East Coast is more dangerous.

970
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,710
Like angry people.
You don't like the New York attitudes,

971
00:43:16,711 --> 00:43:19,530
that Boston attitude toward it.
Gangsters.

972
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:24,531
You know?
East Coast is more aggressive and 

973
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:24,531
aggressive,
but yeah,

974
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:27,690
that's the safer place to live.
But why you think of North Carolina?

975
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:30,360
Why is it a safer place?
Because the whole side,

976
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:32,670
we live on your like into the rural and 
shit,

977
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:37,140
like the earthquakes and the volcanoes 
and fucking like Sorta,

978
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,180
but you know what?
They have to deal with snow.

979
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:45,190
Snow's a mother,
so secrets of snow to snow makes people 

980
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,190
a little more

981
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:49,100
more hostile in America at least.
I tried to explain away that,

982
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,820
that that like why people are so 
aggressive in Boston and New York.

983
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,860
I always said,
what's the deal with that cold weather?

984
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:59,861
It gets you a little more tense,
but I think there's more to it than 

985
00:43:59,861 --> 00:44:02,291
that.
It's cold weather end overpopulation 

986
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,620
together.
That's what makes douchey people because

987
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,590
in Canada people are so fucking Nice,
man.

988
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,600
They're so nice.

989
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,200
Well,
you know what,

990
00:44:08,201 --> 00:44:10,050
that doesn't make sense either because 
even in Toronto,

991
00:44:10,051 --> 00:44:12,640
Toronto's a big ass city and people were
nice as fuck.

992
00:44:12,641 --> 00:44:15,430
They're to Canada.
Maybe it's much higher.

993
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,310
Maybe it's when your body has too much 
hydration,

994
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:20,200
you get angry.
I don't know what it is,

995
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:22,300
man.
It's so cute because Canada is

996
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:27,390
not a country that's living under the 
shadow of this is government that's out 

997
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:29,840
there trying to take over the world.
You know?

998
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:31,560
That's part of it too.
I mean we've.

999
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:32,140
That

1000
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:34,950
that doesn't make up for America in the 
fifties though,

1001
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,440
or you know,
in the thirties or the forties,

1002
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,450
they were pretty aggressive back then 
too,

1003
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:41,880
and even in the 18 hundreds you ever see
gangs of New York.

1004
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,990
What it used to be allowed.
No Dude,

1005
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,310
gangs in New York is an awesome movie.
You've never seen that.

1006
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,690
Oh,
it's awesome to Daniel Day.

1007
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:53,691
Lewis is one of those dudes that like 
becomes whoever the fuck he's in that 

1008
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,810
movie.
He's a different dude when he does these

1009
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:55,770
movies,
you know,

1010
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,950
he's like one of those few guys that 
really.

1011
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,070
Russell Crowe can do that.
Gary Oldman can do the shit out of that.

1012
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:07,190
You know?
He's one of those dudes that just 

1013
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:07,190
becomes a different dude when he's in 
those.

1014
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,270
Hmm.
Years.

1015
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,120
There's,
there's that new Leonardo.

1016
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:12,490
I'm moving to your.
See it shuts stutter islands.

1017
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,820
Yeah.
I didn't like that one.

1018
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,660
No,
no,

1019
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,380
no.
I talked about it.

1020
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,110
I was really good for like the first 
hour or so.

1021
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:24,260
And then I don't want to give away any 
spoilers because some people haven't 

1022
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:24,260
seen it.
You haven't seen it either?

1023
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:28,271
No.
I don't want to say you received the 

1024
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:29,961
beach with him in it or the island or.
I know that's like the cheesiest movie 

1025
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:31,560
ever,
but good fucking actor though.

1026
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,730
He's another one.
He,

1027
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:35,130
he gets into things like he's,
he's good.

1028
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,120
You know.
It's,

1029
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,920
you know what I heard that's a craft.
You know,

1030
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:41,490
there's,
there's,

1031
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,100
there's some cheese heads out there.
They're,

1032
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:46,380
they're not doing anything special,
but there's a few like,

1033
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,680
like God,
that's another thing that um,

1034
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,310
that moved there,
said crazy heart.

1035
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,720
What's the guy's name?
Jeff Bridges.

1036
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,640
Jeff bridges that,
that's another guy.

1037
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:55,290
He's the big Lebowski.
I mean,

1038
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,330
he's just,
he's an amazing actor.

1039
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,570
He's one of those dudes who just,
he gets into that fucking roll man.

1040
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:05,600
He does it.
So Touche to answer some questions or 

1041
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,560
something of your body.

1042
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:13,020
You seeing the movie during with the 
fishes dream with the fishes as David 

1043
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,320
Arquette in it.
Really small budget,

1044
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,300
low budget movie.
But one of the things is,

1045
00:46:16,301 --> 00:46:19,150
is like date,
this guy was dying and said he wanted to

1046
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:24,151
do like his last list of things.
And one thing he did is he went naked 

1047
00:46:24,151 --> 00:46:28,321
boy.
He went into this bowling alley in the 

1048
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:28,321
middle of night on Lsd and went bowling 
naked with strippers.

1049
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:32,870
And that scene right there to me is just
what would.

1050
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:36,820
Is there any three things that you would
say if you knew you were about to die,

1051
00:46:36,821 --> 00:46:38,410
but you would definitely do like.
All right.

1052
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,000
All you know,
everything's off.

1053
00:46:40,001 --> 00:46:42,430
I'm doing this now.
Have you ever thought about that?

1054
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,200
No.
No?

1055
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:44,730
Like I don't have anything.
No?

1056
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,330
No.
Have you ever seen the pyramids?

1057
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:46,980
Yes.
Yeah.

1058
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:49,000
I would like to see the pyramids,
but you know what?

1059
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,890
I'm.
I can be okay without them.

1060
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,400
I think being.
I mean I think I've seen so much of it 

1061
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:56,400
on DVD.
I mean,

1062
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,310
I think yeah,
it would be really nice to go over there

1063
00:46:57,311 --> 00:46:58,850
and see it live for sure.
Definitely.

1064
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,240
It will be spiritual feel like a 
different vibe in the air or something.

1065
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,490
No.
I know what you mean.

1066
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:05,650
Yeah,
but I can be okay without saying that.

1067
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,920
I mean I think it's really.
I would love to see a lot of things.

1068
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,090
I would love to see the Congo,
but I don't want to go in there.

1069
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,080
Right.
It's too scary.

1070
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,000
But if you get.
When force fields come out,

1071
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:16,360
would you go?

1072
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:22,100
Would it be forced to have roads that 
are first I want to make it a fucking 

1073
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,830
charge?
No,

1074
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,350
not now.
You fuck with personal force field.

1075
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,070
We're like,
oh,

1076
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,040
you got a t and t force field.

1077
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,040
What are you fucking crazy.
You're going to go to the Congo with at 

1078
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,460
and t personal have horizon.
Do not go overseas.

1079
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,410
That's no,
no shit.

1080
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:39,400
Right.
It's going to be like,

1081
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:40,650
that's gonna be tied to a t and d one

1082
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,360
Juju.
Like Dr Manhattan.

1083
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,160
What?
Dr Manhattan.

1084
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,060
Was that from the fucking.
Oh,

1085
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,910
what is it?
What's that movie?

1086
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,310
Watchman.
The watchman.

1087
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,710
Jesus Christ.
You know,

1088
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:56,050
I was not familiar with that comic book 
before that movie came out.

1089
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,270
It was good though.

1090
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,350
It was on.
Ellen is Dr Manhattan.

1091
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,100
I don't think I ever talked about this 
with twitter.

1092
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,110
When twitter first came out,
ellen tweeted like,

1093
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,150
Hey,
go to this bus stop if you want to be on

1094
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:09,420
the show,
but you have to dress up as a superhero.

1095
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,610
Hurry.
And I was at the stoplight right next to

1096
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:13,870
that.
That bus stop.

1097
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:17,080
So I pull over and I'm fucking like 
looking through my car.

1098
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:18,820
Trying to find it head like some laundry
in there.

1099
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:23,821
I had some clothes and I'm back pillow 
and I found all these blue things and I 

1100
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:29,041
dressed up all in blue and I put this a 
neck pillow on my head and I got in the 

1101
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:32,620
bus stop and I was on the Ellen show as 
Dr Manhattan.

1102
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,600
And one of the funniest things though 
was I,

1103
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,010
uh,
I took a sleeve of a blue coat and I put

1104
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:42,030
through my zipper and I,
and I tied it at the end and put some 

1105
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:42,030
socks in it and stuff like that.

1106
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:45,250
So it looked like I had this big wavy 
Dick and nobody even saw it.

1107
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,920
Like they didn't even understand that 
that's what it was.

1108
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:51,130
But if you watch it knowing that I'm 
coming out on l and they're like,

1109
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:53,770
let's introduce Dr Wong,
Mr Manhattan or whatever,

1110
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,230
and I'm coming out with this swing video
of this song.

1111
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,510
Uh,
there isn't,

1112
00:48:58,511 --> 00:49:01,810
but I will put a video up.
How do you not have that online?

1113
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,680
Uh,
I think I do,

1114
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:05,410
but it's on my facebook and god,
how dare you.

1115
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:08,980
I'll put it on the masses.
The fucked up shit out right now.

1116
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:13,170
I'll put a red band.com
or twitter home

1117
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,300
red band dot Com.

1118
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:20,610
Get Joe's philosophy of thinking.
That scene,

1119
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,880
that scene,
the pyramids on TV is the same as real 

1120
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:25,880
life.
Oh Man.

1121
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,160
I don't think it's the same as real 
life.

1122
00:49:26,161 --> 00:49:31,161
I'm just saying if,
if there's only a few things I could do 

1123
00:49:31,161 --> 00:49:31,161
before I died,
that wouldn't be my choice.

1124
00:49:31,161 --> 00:49:33,120
I'd be okay without saying it.
I would like to see it.

1125
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:36,300
I'm one of the reasons why I haven't 
done it is because first of all,

1126
00:49:36,301 --> 00:49:39,570
I don't have much time.
I travel so much for work.

1127
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,990
I don't really have that much time to 
travel outside of work.

1128
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,200
It's not fun for me.
It's like I'm traveling all the time,

1129
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:49,410
so like an extra trip to Egypt doesn't 
sound exciting to me.

1130
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:53,010
And then the other part about it is that
it's not that safe over there.

1131
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:53,920
You know,
you've got to be.

1132
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,400
It's tricky.
I don't want to have to sweat shit.

1133
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:01,730
You know,
I saw the only ruins I've ever seen 

1134
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,180
where in Mexico I saw the Mayan ruins at
Chichen Itza,

1135
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,540
which is a.
It was pretty humbling man and it's 

1136
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,751
really fascinating.
Just stand there and I do agree that 

1137
00:50:11,751 --> 00:50:12,690
there's a big difference between 
standing there in person,

1138
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:18,080
you know,
and checking these things out than 

1139
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,660
watching a video or seeing it in 
pictures.

1140
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,780
Standing there in person was a pretty 
flabbergasted,

1141
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,530
but all I'm saying is I don't need to go
to Egypt.

1142
00:50:25,531 --> 00:50:26,790
I would like to.
Yes,

1143
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,190
but I don't need to.
I can be okay

1144
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,540
without doing that,
but it's.

1145
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:32,740
I'm not saying that it's the same thing.
It's certainly not now,

1146
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,750
but you can learn a lot of things about 
certain places and really experienced 

1147
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,580
like how amazing and beautiful they are 
just from dvds.

1148
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,490
Like you really don't have to fucking.
You don't have to go to the Congo.

1149
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:47,720
The Congo is so fucking dangerous.
Everything there is trying to kill you.

1150
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:52,721
Everything there,
they got ants there that killed 

1151
00:50:52,721 --> 00:50:54,440
elephants.
What did you hear me son.

1152
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:59,180
They got ants that kill elephants.
They climb up the fucking elephant,

1153
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:03,440
go into his ear and start eating his 
brain while he's alive,

1154
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:08,620
and they do that in surges.
They have these little monster ants to 

1155
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,000
climb inside and eat their fucking 
brain,

1156
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:16,150
and they're responsible for way more 
deaths in Africa than any of the other 

1157
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,050
things.
Ants killed everything,

1158
00:51:18,051 --> 00:51:20,030
man.
They killed everything.

1159
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:24,650
There's some monster,
crazy scary aunts and in Africa,

1160
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:30,310
and that's not even for fuck all that.
What about the spiders that act as a 

1161
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:33,740
team?
There's no spiders anywhere in the world

1162
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:37,880
that act impacts except the Congo and 
they don't even know why,

1163
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,680
but fucking deers get trapped in these 
little tiny spider webs.

1164
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:47,770
Deers get trapped.
These tiny spiders swarm on it like 100 

1165
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:51,590
wants and fuck them up.
They make these giant ass fucking webs.

1166
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:55,520
They've realized that they're small and 
in order to survive and stay alive,

1167
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,860
they have to Jack bigger shit.
So they,

1168
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,140
they fucking teamed up.
They get birds,

1169
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:02,540
they get all kinds of shit.
It's fucking nuts,

1170
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:04,340
man.
It is nuts.

1171
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,460
And that's just spiders.
What about the fucking snakes?

1172
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,620
There's all kinds of fucking snakes in 
the Congo.

1173
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:11,810
There's,
there's a chimpanzee in the Congo that's

1174
00:52:11,811 --> 00:52:14,780
six feet tall and they walk upright.

1175
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,560
Sometimes they're called Bondo apes.
It sounds retarded.

1176
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:21,290
It sounds totally ridiculous because 
nobody ever tells you about it,

1177
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,750
but they have photographs of these 
things.

1178
00:52:23,751 --> 00:52:28,751
They got a picture of a dead one.
They have a different bone samples like 

1179
00:52:29,121 --> 00:52:31,730
they've confirmed.
This is an actual real animal.

1180
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,340
It has a crest on his head like a 
gorilla does.

1181
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:39,520
So it's a different animal.
It's a different species of chimpanzee 

1182
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,660
that's much larger.
And they call them lion killers.

1183
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:46,661
That's what the locals call them and 
they have fucking observed scientists 

1184
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:48,290
observed and photographed them eating a 
dead Jaguar.

1185
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,540
They don't know if they killed the 
Jaguar,

1186
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,960
but what the fuck they're eating a 
Goddamn Jaguar.

1187
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:56,570
That's why verizon personal force field 
is important.

1188
00:52:56,571 --> 00:52:59,720
Very important.
But I would love to see all that,

1189
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:01,130
you know,
but I don't want to go there.

1190
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:04,220
Jesus Christ,
go to the Congo.

1191
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,770
Just a mosquito will fuck the rest of 
your life up.

1192
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,090
You ever watched that show?
Uh,

1193
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,350
the enemies inside us,
when people,

1194
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,400
they always go swimming in Africa and 
like fucking geniuses and shit gets in 

1195
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:15,950
their ear,
starts rotting away their brain,

1196
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,160
you know,
like big giant tumors growing in their 

1197
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,411
head and it turns out massive worms that
they picked up an Africa seven years 

1198
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:24,140
ago.
Get the fuck out of Africa.

1199
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,520
Are you crazy?
Everything's trying to kill you.

1200
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:31,521
They're everything.
That scary math sounds like a good porn 

1201
00:53:31,521 --> 00:53:31,550
to enemy inside you.

1202
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:36,720
That's one of the things that parents 
do.

1203
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:41,750
They're really good at that.
They're really good at coming up with a 

1204
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:42,030
Jersey hoarder names.
Yeah.

1205
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,900
They're pretty,
pretty creative when it comes to that.

1206
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:50,530
What are the questions up in this bitch?
Yeah,

1207
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,510
we're youtube that Bondo Apes,
man,

1208
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:57,600
that thing will freak the fuck.
I twittered the neon Helen,

1209
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,190
but I could only find it in torrent 
right now,

1210
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:01,170
but there's links from the torn.
Oh really?

1211
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,850
Yeah.
Powerful torrent.

1212
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:08,910
Somebody retweets it for me,
so it shows up on the use steering

1213
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:09,950
chat,

1214
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:23,190
so I want to see that with clash of the 
titans.

1215
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:25,630
Yeah.
I want to say that too.

1216
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,870
That looks like a flag reviews though.
Really?

1217
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,130
Yeah,
I heard it was shit.

1218
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,750
Will they probably weren't high.
Yeah,

1219
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:33,030
it's true.
I bet it's not smoking weed.

1220
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,150
I didn't smoke weed for almost a week 
into until recently.

1221
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,570
Oh,
it discusses.

1222
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,730
Are you aware that the internet came out
of CERN?

1223
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,710
No,
I didn't know that.

1224
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,900
Those are the people that are working on
the large Hadron collider.

1225
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,530
Wow.
I thought the Internet came up.

1226
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:46,810
Al Gore's butthole.
That wasn't it.

1227
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,700
How did that even see?
Never really said Wiszniak started that.

1228
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:56,170
Larry that would start this thing about 
guard,

1229
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,830
but he never really said that he 
invented the Internet.

1230
00:54:58,831 --> 00:55:03,831
Right.
He helped work on the what became the 

1231
00:55:03,831 --> 00:55:04,470
Internet,
but it was more like funding.

1232
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:09,500
Right.
Pushed a bill through or some nonsense 

1233
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:14,140
guy pushing for it.
He might've said that he was one of the 

1234
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:14,140
people that help.

1235
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:14,140
Did he ever say,
does anybody know?

1236
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,650
I don't even want to look that up.
You don't want to fuck Al Gore.

1237
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,340
I don't give a shit about Al Gore.
When I heard that,

1238
00:55:19,341 --> 00:55:22,710
how much money Al Gore's made from 
climate research,

1239
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,180
now I'm like,
what?

1240
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:29,450
Al Gore has made an ass load of money 
based on the idea that we are,

1241
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:30,640
uh,
you know,

1242
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:35,520
warming the earth with our bullshit and 
we may very well been,

1243
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:36,420
I don't know,
man,

1244
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:39,150
but I do know that people get nutty 
about that issue.

1245
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:42,120
That's one of those weird issues.
These,

1246
00:55:42,121 --> 00:55:47,121
those right left issues are so strange 
where people just start spouting out 

1247
00:55:47,121 --> 00:55:51,560
shit and they don't.
They haven't really done the research 

1248
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:51,560
yet.
You know,

1249
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:51,870
like there's a,
there's a good video.

1250
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:53,830
The same guy that did this video,
uh,

1251
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,460
with Sarah Pailin.
Don't remember the dude's name.

1252
00:55:56,461 --> 00:56:01,461
I'm going to find out though,
but he did a video where he went to a 

1253
00:56:01,461 --> 00:56:02,000
Sarah Pailin book signing and then ask 
these people like,

1254
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,200
what do you feel about,
uh,

1255
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:05,180
you know,
Sarah Pailin,

1256
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,240
what really gets you excited about,
you know,

1257
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:12,030
about her stance on the issues and no 
one knew a fucking thing.

1258
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,860
Like not no one had any idea what,
you know,

1259
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:16,320
they were just like,
she's just,

1260
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,570
she stands for,
you know,

1261
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:22,230
down home values and I think she's the 
best thing going,

1262
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,250
she's getting back to real people,

1263
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:29,250
like they're just saying nonsense and 
you realize that people don't have to 

1264
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:29,770
fucking,
they don't have to,

1265
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,970
you know,
make sense.

1266
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,310
They just have to have a bunch of people
thinking that makes sense.

1267
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:38,490
That's all you really need to have.
But this guy who did it with the tea 

1268
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:38,490
party people too,
I don't like,

1269
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,500
I don't know fucking dude's name,
but uh,

1270
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,510
he made this video and it was,
it was just genius Shit,

1271
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:44,530
man.
You know,

1272
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:49,531
and people just think everybody just,
they just take a side that their team 

1273
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:51,700
takes,
you know what I mean?

1274
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:54,430
And it's like there's US versus them 
nonsense.

1275
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,310
It's just so crazy.
And when it comes to global warming,

1276
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,380
when it comes to healthcare,
it's like,

1277
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:04,420
you know,
everyone has a very typical and 

1278
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,110
predictable,
what are you doing?

1279
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:10,230
Let's come back to that typical and 
predictable a stance on things.

1280
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,450
And very rarely do people stray outside,
you know,

1281
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:16,390
the either or ideologies left or right.
You know,

1282
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:20,050
I hate when people ask me,
are you a Democrat or Republican?

1283
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:22,960
Like what are you talking about?
It's a nonsense game.

1284
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:26,560
It's all nonsense.
There's no fucking Democrats and there's

1285
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:30,040
no Republican says stop it.
It's all nonsense.

1286
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:32,500
It's been nonsense since the beginning.
It's just a,

1287
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:36,190
it's a bunch of fucking red tape and,
and,

1288
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:39,520
and,
and fucking just complications.

1289
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:43,990
A bunch of shit piled up together to,
to control either or.

1290
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:47,170
No,
the idea that there really are democrats

1291
00:57:47,171 --> 00:57:47,740
and they're really.
I mean,

1292
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:50,170
look at what Obama's doing.
He's doing the exact same shit.

1293
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:52,030
Bush.
Did you just doing a little,

1294
00:57:52,031 --> 00:57:54,550
a few things different socially and all 
of a don't ask,

1295
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:56,790
don't tell.
But when you win the Nobel Peace Prize,

1296
00:57:56,791 --> 00:57:59,710
he still sent 30,000
more people to a war that nobody wants.

1297
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:01,470
I mean,
do they really know more than ever?

1298
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,760
Can you tell me,
man,

1299
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,820
dude,
it's like talking sports and to me,

1300
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:08,430
don't you think that if you just don't,
it doesn't to me.

1301
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,870
Well you should.
I don't think you should spend that much

1302
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:12,120
time.
Who cares what it is?

1303
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,720
Fuck that guy.
Fuck it all.

1304
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,220
It's all stupid.
Just negative.

1305
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:19,240
If you really think about how fucked up 
this whole United States government is,

1306
00:58:19,241 --> 00:58:22,600
but I mean you think that it's.
Is it possible to do anything about it?

1307
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:27,601
I think if it is what the ways you're 
going to do something about it is not 

1308
00:58:27,601 --> 00:58:30,631
necessarily influencing people with 
thought and changing these people's 

1309
00:58:30,631 --> 00:58:32,920
opinions before they get into this 
terrible situation of doing fuck up.

1310
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:35,200
Things that are not benefiting the 
people I think.

1311
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:37,610
I think you have to affect them.
You have to let them know that they're.

1312
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:42,670
They're not going to live forever.
I think there's people way better than 

1313
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:45,541
that than me,
so instead of worrying and spending my 

1314
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:45,541
stress on it,
I didn't even though man,

1315
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,970
to me it's just like another crazy 
reality show that I have to watch.

1316
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,950
You know,
like it's,

1317
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:55,330
it's like they attack each other where 
it's so ridiculous.

1318
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:58,480
You can't believe anyone can't.
Everyone's fucking fake.

1319
00:58:58,481 --> 00:59:01,600
It's all bullshit.
Craziest that Fox News is real,

1320
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:06,601
that that's a real.
I mean that is like some parody crazy 

1321
00:59:06,601 --> 00:59:09,010
too that Fox news is a real show.
Fox News is like if there was like a TV,

1322
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:11,530
a movie from the eighties with like Bill
Murray in it,

1323
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,980
some sort of a parody that would be like
the right wing,

1324
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,200
you know,
Rah Rah fucking truth organization.

1325
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:22,220
That would be the network that they 
would make fun of in a parody movie.

1326
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,710
And that's what's really going on man.
And the parody movie,

1327
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:28,220
that would be like some really hot 
blonde chick who was mean as fuck,

1328
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:33,700
you know,
like all those hot blonde chicks on Fox 

1329
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:37,360
News,
they all look like they had this mean 

1330
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:37,360
face the other hot as fuck.
But they've got this.

1331
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,540
They'll fucking yell at you man.
You know what I mean?

1332
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:39,440
They,
when they,

1333
00:59:39,441 --> 00:59:44,441
when they interrogate dudes on the show,
when they give people a hard time on 

1334
00:59:44,441 --> 00:59:47,390
Charlotte and cut people off,
like they're like the stern right wing,

1335
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:51,230
like Arion blue,
wide hot bitches,

1336
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:56,290
you know,
that's perfect for like a Bill Murray 

1337
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:56,290
movie.
And those checks would be real horny and

1338
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:57,980
somebody be fucking.
Would they be screaming out Nazi shit or

1339
00:59:57,981 --> 00:59:59,190
something?
You know what I mean?

1340
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,320
That,
that would be in the movie.

1341
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,820
I mean,
they really are.

1342
01:00:01,821 --> 01:00:03,650
It is really.
His life is like a movement.

1343
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:08,680
Life is like as ridiculous as a movie 
more almost unbelievable,

1344
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:10,430
right?
I mean,

1345
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:15,590
what,
when you think about like a plot in a 

1346
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:15,590
movie that you know,
is,

1347
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:15,820
uh,
is predictable and annoys you,

1348
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,630
you know,
life is way more,

1349
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:21,680
way more wacky than that.
You know what I mean?

1350
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:24,300
Like that Ted Haggard thing with that 
guys,

1351
01:00:24,301 --> 01:00:24,710
the,
you know,

1352
01:00:24,711 --> 01:00:29,711
the,
the religious guy gets caught doing gay 

1353
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:29,711
sex and crystal Meth,
you know,

1354
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:33,701
the fucking John Edwards thing where he 
gets busted and his wife is dying and 

1355
01:00:33,701 --> 01:00:35,680
he's having this baby with this other 
woman and this,

1356
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,930
this craziness that goes on with people,
you know,

1357
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:40,120
all of it.
Altogether.

1358
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:42,560
It's like we are the nuttiest movie of 
all time.

1359
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,810
You know,
we're the krays movie ever,

1360
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,350
don't you think?
Yeah.

1361
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:51,310
What the fuck is this folks?
Where,

1362
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,290
where is this going?
You know,

1363
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:56,470
we're all just living and until our 
bodies shutoff

1364
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:01,840
and we don't even address it,
we don't even stop and really think 

1365
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,120
about it.
I mean,

1366
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:03,050
you know,
on Oprah,

1367
01:01:03,051 --> 01:01:08,051
you know,
everybody wants to tell you how you can 

1368
01:01:08,051 --> 01:01:08,210
better decorate your living room with 
fucking Feng Shui and you know,

1369
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:10,030
the,
the,

1370
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,320
the,
the current

1371
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,950
consciousness of our culture,
you know,

1372
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:20,030
is not at all focused on the really big 
questions.

1373
01:01:21,121 --> 01:01:23,550
Like the really freaky fucking 
questions.

1374
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:27,990
Like the fact that how little we think 
about space,

1375
01:01:27,991 --> 01:01:32,991
you know,
the little we think about the fact that 

1376
01:01:32,991 --> 01:01:35,540
at any time some crazy shit can happen.
There can be in a hyper Nova and the 

1377
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:39,780
next galaxy and we'd be wiped out 
instantly if this is all real and random

1378
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:42,850
and easily can happen.
Now it's.

1379
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,380
Is there any money in campfires like 
make a campfire?

1380
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:52,560
No,
because you'd be really good at 

1381
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:52,560
campfires somehow.
You could,

1382
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,750
if there was any money in like a 
campfires,

1383
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:54,020
like,
hey,

1384
01:01:54,021 --> 01:01:56,980
we're going to have a campfire tonight.
If you could get any money from that,

1385
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,050
and he goes,
rogue is going to be at this campfire.

1386
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:03,180
What don't you think you'd be like,
the best person be a bunch.

1387
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:06,140
Would want to take pictures of me with 
their fists up.

1388
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:11,160
I can get the.
Imagine you would like a job corps light

1389
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,470
in in big coolers and they be like,
Yo Bro,

1390
01:02:14,471 --> 01:02:19,471
who's going to be GSP?
Stop running this like,

1391
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:24,800
man,
we're talking about ancient 

1392
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:24,800
civilizations,
Bro.

1393
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:24,800
Oh fuck.
Those ancient faggots.

1394
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,400
It would appear.
I bought the worms.

1395
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:31,120
Growing worms.
Anyways,

1396
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:36,270
this is what you stopped campfires 
instead of comedy in it of Campfire 

1397
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:37,420
night where you're in the middle of a 
campfire,

1398
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:42,421
you all bring your tens and your hang 
out and smoke weed and do mushrooms and 

1399
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:44,470
you're in the middle because it's just 
like doing like what you're doing now or

1400
01:02:44,471 --> 01:02:49,471
stand up.
Kind of like by kind of like a metal 

1401
01:02:49,471 --> 01:02:49,471
talking campfire guy.

1402
01:02:49,471 --> 01:02:50,150
That sounds like a great way to get 
annoyed by hippies.

1403
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:55,750
True.
You've got to deal with a lot of stinks 

1404
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:55,750
bringing her.
Monica.

1405
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,820
Monica is a bunch of stinky dudes that 
need favors.

1406
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,000
That's going to be annoying.
There'll be annoying.

1407
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:04,300
That's the number one problem with 
marijuana is hippies.

1408
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,620
God Damn.
Some of them are annoying.

1409
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:09,230
Can you imagine the smell?
The hackey sack convention?

1410
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:14,980
Yeah.
Occurred occurred though Petrouli and 

1411
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:18,050
hacky sack sweats.
Hippies.

1412
01:03:18,051 --> 01:03:18,980
You know,
the,

1413
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:24,140
the idea behind it is great.
The problem is a lot of the people that 

1414
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,150
fall into that,
that mode of thinking,

1415
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,130
they're all fucked up,
you know,

1416
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:30,410
they're lazy too.
That's another problem with hippies.

1417
01:03:30,411 --> 01:03:32,750
A lot of them are fucking lazy,
you know,

1418
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:36,880
a lot of them are always broke and 
always want you to help him out.

1419
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:37,760
Oh,
it's like,

1420
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,470
it's a drain.
Like if you have hippies for friends,

1421
01:03:40,471 --> 01:03:45,471
it's like some of them are just 
constantly asking you for favors and it 

1422
01:03:45,471 --> 01:03:45,471
gets so annoying.

1423
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:50,950
You know?
It's like you have to cut them off as 

1424
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:50,950
friends.
Like you're just always needy.

1425
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:50,950
Fuck,
like,

1426
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,270
can't your Goddamn shit together.
You know?

1427
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:55,820
That's like,
how many dudes do you know that are like

1428
01:03:55,821 --> 01:03:57,440
that,
that they're like always broke.

1429
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:58,250
I,
come on,

1430
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:01,250
man,
you gotta get your shit together.

1431
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:04,780
Better out here though,
back in Ohio is completely different.

1432
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,900
Way More brokester in Ohio,
you know,

1433
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:12,930
at least out here.
And most people I didn't know or you 

1434
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:13,050
know,
kind of like have jobs like glassware,

1435
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,680
you know,
where like comics and people that aren't

1436
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,520
the people that are in your circle.
Yeah,

1437
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:18,970
yeah,
yeah.

1438
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,030
Well,
you know,

1439
01:04:20,031 --> 01:04:22,900
what man was living a regular life,
you know,

1440
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:27,901
regular jobs.
It's very hard for people to do after 

1441
01:04:27,901 --> 01:04:30,821
awhile because you know,
we're sold this bill of goods that all 

1442
01:04:30,821 --> 01:04:30,860
you need to be happy is,
you know,

1443
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:33,230
find something that pays well and that 
we're,

1444
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,460
you know,
steady work.

1445
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,560
Doesn't matter if you don't love it,
you still have your free time,

1446
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:37,590
you know,
you,

1447
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,500
you go through it and yeah,
you know,

1448
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,100
you move up the ladder and you make more
money in,

1449
01:04:41,101 --> 01:04:43,580
you buy a bigger house and then he 
fucking die.

1450
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:45,470
You know,
there's no,

1451
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,990
there's no end to that.
You know.

1452
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:52,550
And for some idea,
for some reason were sold at there is,

1453
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:57,730
were sold that we're doing something,
we're working hard and the eventually 

1454
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:58,340
it's going to pay off.
It doesn't pay off.

1455
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,310
He just die.
You know,

1456
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,140
everybody just dies.
So you have to enjoy this.

1457
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:06,500
This is what you have enjoyed right now,
and it's not,

1458
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:09,770
it's not possible for everybody.
There's been a lot of times in your life

1459
01:05:09,771 --> 01:05:12,350
and in my life that we weren't enjoying 
things,

1460
01:05:12,351 --> 01:05:13,090
you know,
you know,

1461
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:14,930
I wasn't,
I wasn't enjoying life.

1462
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,890
I didn't have Dr.
Limos,

1463
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,960
that Limo.
What was that like?

1464
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:24,961
Have you ever.
Did you ever do anything famous or 

1465
01:05:24,961 --> 01:05:24,961
anyone famous or anyone that would like,
wow,

1466
01:05:24,961 --> 01:05:26,050
I,
Frank Sinatra is in the back of my limo.

1467
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:30,190
I almost got to drive a Stevie Ray 
Vaughan,

1468
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:33,400
but he wouldn't take limos.
He would only take a cab.

1469
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:35,260
Is that like the worst day for you?
Were like,

1470
01:05:35,261 --> 01:05:38,380
I'm getting drunk tonight?
Almost was like,

1471
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:38,710
yeah,

1472
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,780
I probably would have panicked.
I probably killed him.

1473
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:44,180
It would probably be me that killed him 
and not the a helicopter.

1474
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:47,420
I was um,
I was a huge TV Rayvon fat.

1475
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,820
So if I really got to drive him in a 
car,

1476
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,620
I'd probably panicked.
I was only 19 years old.

1477
01:05:51,621 --> 01:05:53,180
I was an idiot,
you know,

1478
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:54,440
maybe I was 20,
20.

1479
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,240
I was watching,
I wasn't at home.

1480
01:05:56,241 --> 01:05:58,160
So yeah,
I think I moved out of my parent's house

1481
01:05:58,161 --> 01:06:03,161
when I was 20,
so I think I was 21 when I was doing 

1482
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:03,161
that.

1483
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:05,630
I was watching that a driver when we 
were out of town in New York.

1484
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:10,660
I was watching the limo driver and he 
had to like sit in his car like the 

1485
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:11,720
whole day he was having like a full on 
like his wife with his wife,

1486
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:15,770
just having conversations and I felt bad
for these guys because they're like gone

1487
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:18,050
for chunks at a time.

1488
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:23,100
It's a hard job and you know what's 
really hard about it is the hours they 

1489
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:23,920
want you to work crazy hours.
I mean,

1490
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,080
and the way they would put it to me 
though when I,

1491
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:27,610
when I first got the job there that was 
saying,

1492
01:06:27,611 --> 01:06:32,611
you know what a lot of you guys,
you're going to go to school and you 

1493
01:06:32,611 --> 01:06:35,131
know you're going to try to make a 
living and you've got to realize it's a 

1494
01:06:35,131 --> 01:06:35,131
hard job for us out there.
You know,

1495
01:06:35,131 --> 01:06:37,210
it's hard to get jobs.
You look at Mike over there,

1496
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:41,260
he's been working here for 10 years.
He doesn't bust his ass,

1497
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:45,070
he sits down at a nice Kyle Day and he 
makes $60,000

1498
01:06:45,071 --> 01:06:46,330
a year.
Okay,

1499
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:48,700
that's real money.
That's what they said to me.

1500
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:50,620
And I was sitting there going,
oh my God,

1501
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:52,000
do you know how many hours that God 
works?

1502
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:57,030
He doesn't have a life.
Like he gave away his whole life for 

1503
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:57,030
$60,000
a year.

1504
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:01,050
Like this fucking guy was literally no 
bullshit working 16 hours every day.

1505
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,870
He was always there and uh,
I looked at him and I was like,

1506
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:06,580
okay,
you got tricks on,

1507
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:07,390
you know,
you're,

1508
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,810
you're doing the wrong thing,
man.

1509
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,990
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
But no,

1510
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,230
that ain't easy man.
If you got a job,

1511
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,880
if you're only doing it for a few hours 
a day,

1512
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:17,200
you know,
if you're doing it like a regular job,

1513
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:18,910
but it ain't bad really.
If you have good clients,

1514
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:24,160
you know,
what are you're doing just sitting down 

1515
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:24,160
and drive it and that's no big deal,
but they want you to work crazy hours.

1516
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,000
I was doing 40 hours a week and they 
were,

1517
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:27,910
they were adamant they wanted me to put 
it more out.

1518
01:07:27,911 --> 01:07:29,200
So I'd work eight hours.

1519
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:34,380
I would work eight hours and I would 
want to go home and they'll go eight 

1520
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:34,630
hours,
just nothing like it with is 12 and he's

1521
01:07:34,631 --> 01:07:36,480
still waiting for his next pickup and be
like,

1522
01:07:36,481 --> 01:07:38,860
for Fuck Mikey and fuck you.
I worked eight hours.

1523
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,410
Get me out of here stupid.
I don't want any more hours.

1524
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:42,550
I got,
I got work to do.

1525
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:45,200
I had a Gig at a,
uh,

1526
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,840
some fucking bar,
you know,

1527
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:49,510
one of these comedy things and I had to 
leave work for the Gig.

1528
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,450
And um,
when I was there on the way there,

1529
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:54,250
they switched the gigs,
but they said,

1530
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:59,280
oh,
we're gonna send you to this one 

1531
01:07:59,280 --> 01:07:59,280
instead.
I think there was like a,

1532
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,190
I think it was probably Boston comedy at
the time because like a booking agency 

1533
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:02,410
and they had a bunch of these little 
gigs,

1534
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,360
you know,
like in weird little places,

1535
01:08:04,361 --> 01:08:07,210
you drive like an hour and a half and it
was like a little sports bar.

1536
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:12,330
And then have a little stage and he 
would go on stage and sometimes they 

1537
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:12,330
would switch.
You say,

1538
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:13,180
hey this guy is going to go with him 
because he doesn't have a car,

1539
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,700
so why don't you go to this place 
instead?

1540
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:20,110
So that's what I did.
And so this asshole called up the 

1541
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:21,110
fucking the bar where I was supposed to 
be because he asked me like,

1542
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,130
you're leaving out.
I'm like,

1543
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:27,131
I got a Gig.
So he calls up the fucking bar and then 

1544
01:08:27,131 --> 01:08:28,070
the next day says,
you lying motherfucker.

1545
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,680
You told me you were working.
Like,

1546
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,200
like,
like,

1547
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:35,380
like dude,
I work eight hours and yeah I got 

1548
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,720
switched.
I had tell him the whole story to keep 

1549
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:37,720
my job.
And he had to call this bar

1550
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,380
right after working eight hours.
Right.

1551
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:41,920
He said I used to wash windows with me 
and this girl was the worst.

1552
01:08:41,921 --> 01:08:46,921
She would have a little girl and hold 
the ladder and I would have to climb 

1553
01:08:46,921 --> 01:08:50,170
like four stories up or while stone out 
of my mind and try to clean windows,

1554
01:08:50,171 --> 01:08:55,171
like bending over and stuff.
You doing that because it was like $12 

1555
01:08:55,171 --> 01:08:58,441
an hour and in Ohio,
$12 an hour is amazing and we were 

1556
01:08:58,441 --> 01:08:58,441
actually doing it stoned.
Huh?

1557
01:08:58,441 --> 01:08:59,890
While we're doing that,
it's been washing windows.

1558
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:06,690
What else are you going to do?
Like wash windows and be sober was the 

1559
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:08,560
way the fuck up jet a letter like that?
God Damn.

1560
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:10,740
That'd be terrifying.
But sometimes you just go to a house and

1561
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:11,770
you got,
Oh fuck,

1562
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:12,970
why'd I get stoned?
You know,

1563
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:14,970
you look at the house.
Oh No.

1564
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:17,020
And anyways,
my boss,

1565
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:22,460
this old lady said that me or the girl 
who was my girlfriend at the time that 

1566
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:26,710
we worked together a stole something 
from her house and we got fired.

1567
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:29,300
That boss is yelling and screaming at us
and it's like,

1568
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,780
like I wasn't even going to pay us any 
paycheck stuff.

1569
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,150
Then a week later they,
he called us back.

1570
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,020
Oh,
by the way,

1571
01:09:35,021 --> 01:09:37,960
she found what she was looking for her 
and she apologizes and I'm like,

1572
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:38,860
oh,
well yeah,

1573
01:09:38,861 --> 01:09:42,940
me and this girl fired and kick ass.

1574
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:46,290
Do you remember what it's like to have a
boss?

1575
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,820
Like have bosses?
Oh,

1576
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:52,350
most of my life,
whereas this waiting tables like shit,

1577
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:56,610
the idea that someone who is above you 
in a work organization that gets treated

1578
01:09:56,611 --> 01:09:58,680
like shit,
that is one of the worst feelings in the

1579
01:09:58,681 --> 01:10:01,530
world.
I did construction most of the time.

1580
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:06,531
I did construction.
I did it under nice guys or y'all never 

1581
01:10:06,531 --> 01:10:08,090
had any real bad bosses,
but I did have one bad bosses.

1582
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:12,240
A landscaper guy was an asshole.
Just just an asshole.

1583
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:15,120
Just not friendly,
not nice.

1584
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:18,390
Wanted you to always work harder.
Never had a smile,

1585
01:10:18,391 --> 01:10:21,030
never appreciated your work.
Would give your money.

1586
01:10:21,031 --> 01:10:23,730
At the end of the week we'd like to look
like you didn't even deserve this.

1587
01:10:23,731 --> 01:10:26,640
Why you motherfucker.
I work for you all week.

1588
01:10:26,641 --> 01:10:29,100
You cunt.
I worked all week,

1589
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:34,160
all day,
all week exhausted at the end of every 

1590
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:34,160
day.
Just so tired.

1591
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:38,670
Push the lawnmower in the hot sun and 
digging holes for people and doing 

1592
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:38,670
whatever the fuck they want you to do.

1593
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,050
It's labor,
you know,

1594
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:43,980
and this motherfucker didn't give a shit
like I couldn't imagine that.

1595
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:49,160
I couldn't imagine having someone to 
work for me and having them do all this 

1596
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,080
stuff and then treating them like shit,
like,

1597
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:50,900
you know,
it was a few,

1598
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:55,940
you don't fucking deserve this.
Like really like what kind of a fucking 

1599
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:56,730
human being,
you know,

1600
01:10:56,731 --> 01:10:59,070
make someone work hard and doesn't 
appreciate that,

1601
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:04,120
you know,
that's terrible and it sets you up in 

1602
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:04,120
life to start thinking of work like 
that,

1603
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:09,020
you know,
so you never think you're going to do 

1604
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:09,020
anything with your time that's going to 
be actually fun.

1605
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,220
You don't think it's even possible,
you know,

1606
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,520
I did.
I washed dishes.

1607
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:18,840
That was the worst was pretty bad.
But on the grill the grill was way worse

1608
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:23,841
for my acne because I do fucking 
cheeseburgers and I was a lazy fucking 

1609
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:29,031
kid.
I didn't wash my face and I was like a 

1610
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:29,031
teenager.
So I was getting all these visits anyway

1611
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:33,880
and it just,
my whole face was just a fucking 

1612
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:33,880
festival.
I stopped working there.

1613
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,760
I moved up to Papa Ginos to the Little 
Papa Ginos for while,

1614
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:41,310
and then I started getting real jobs.
Then I started teaching martial arts.

1615
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,760
You had,
the best part was I was a projectionist 

1616
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:46,760
for like eight years and managers and 
movie theaters and stuff like that,

1617
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,330
but working in the movie theater 
industry,

1618
01:11:48,331 --> 01:11:53,331
it's so fun.
Especially when was the projectionist 

1619
01:11:53,331 --> 01:11:53,331
job is like,
you know,

1620
01:11:53,331 --> 01:11:53,520
thread.
The movie is almost like an art,

1621
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:57,790
just like threading this film through 
this one machine and they the perfect to

1622
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:03,670
start the movie.
You sit there and watch it with 

1623
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:03,670
headphones on or I just like go out back
smoke weed,

1624
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:04,350
you know.
It was just like,

1625
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:06,710
that was my job and it's so crazy with 
the coolest

1626
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:10,390
times ever after a show wants back of 
the old laptop and Houston.

1627
01:12:10,391 --> 01:12:15,391
This was right when the Blair witch 
project came out and these kids came to 

1628
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:17,020
the show and then after they came to the
show,

1629
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:20,950
we all went out and we watched a Blair 
witch at the theater.

1630
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:24,400
It was really late at night because 
there was like a show at the laptop.

1631
01:12:24,401 --> 01:12:28,510
The laptop was like 11:00
at night and it went on until like 1:30,

1632
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,740
so it was like 2:00
in the morning.

1633
01:12:29,741 --> 01:12:33,430
By the time we get out and these kids 
opened up the theater and turned it on,

1634
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:37,300
did everything just for us.
So it was like me and them and you know,

1635
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:42,330
my friend Chris Mcguire and like one 
other guy from the comedy club and we 

1636
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:42,330
all watched player,
which yeah,

1637
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:46,890
that's those days they fucking hook x 
boxes up to it and it's all digital 

1638
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:49,320
agenda.
Wagner's like anytime you want to come,

1639
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:54,321
like they do it on the imax screen.
Had a universal there and play xbox on 

1640
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,730
this.
Perfect.

1641
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,470
Steve,
my head might explode.

1642
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:02,070
Imagine that quake fucking head might 
explode.

1643
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:04,730
I can't do it.
I'm scared of quake dude.

1644
01:13:04,731 --> 01:13:09,731
To this day.
I thought about playing it the other 

1645
01:13:09,731 --> 01:13:09,731
day.
I got scared

1646
01:13:09,731 --> 01:13:09,731
by the way,
dude.

1647
01:13:09,731 --> 01:13:13,631
Your dvds out to you should use a plug 
that and my short movies on there 

1648
01:13:13,631 --> 01:13:17,090
talking monkeys and Columbus and uh,
it's pretty cool to watch it.

1649
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,450
Yeah.
The dvds out.

1650
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,220
So if you saw the special,
uh,

1651
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:21,750
on tv,
it's that.

1652
01:13:21,751 --> 01:13:22,820
And there's a lot of,
uh,

1653
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:28,040
it's uncensored and then there's a lot 
of q and a footage just like five 

1654
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:28,040
minutes or something.
It's a lot,

1655
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,700
it's like,
I don't remember how many minutes it is,

1656
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:34,701
but it's,
it's a lot of q and a and I do that in 

1657
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:34,701
most of the shows.
I just,

1658
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:35,240
I always feel like,
uh,

1659
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,750
it makes it more fun,
you know,

1660
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:42,030
it's one thing to have like a normal 
comedy show and I know you want that 

1661
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:42,520
too.
But uh,

1662
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:45,090
I think it's also fun to just shoot the 
shit together,

1663
01:13:45,091 --> 01:13:46,680
you know,
and me make fun of things,

1664
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:47,880
you know,
with a microphone.

1665
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:49,750
And so the end of the show,
uh,

1666
01:13:49,751 --> 01:13:52,430
I always have that kind of q and a type 
thing except

1667
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:57,550
it's almost becoming bits because they 
want to ask the same questions and that 

1668
01:13:57,550 --> 01:13:58,010
kind of sexist to Vcu twice and you're 
getting the same questions.

1669
01:13:58,011 --> 01:13:58,590
Then it's like,
well,

1670
01:13:59,110 --> 01:13:59,580
I know I

1671
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,610
tried.
Some things have to be answered the same

1672
01:14:01,611 --> 01:14:03,050
way,
like the DMT thing.

1673
01:14:03,051 --> 01:14:04,880
There's no other way to answer it,
you know,

1674
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,950
when I try to explain that there's no 
other way to explain it.

1675
01:14:06,951 --> 01:14:08,870
I have to explain it the best way I can 
explain it.

1676
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,370
And that's,
that's that.

1677
01:14:10,371 --> 01:14:11,800
And it's going to sound same way every 
time.

1678
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:12,040
The only

1679
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,490
way.
It's funny,

1680
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:14,110
it's if it's,
if I do it like that anyway,

1681
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,420
there is a bit.
So they don't want to do about that.

1682
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:19,690
I'm going to put that on my next,
a comedy special,

1683
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:24,720
that description of it.
So that way nobody ever asked me again 

1684
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:24,720
because they know what it is,
you know,

1685
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:24,970
like,
you know what I mean?

1686
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,500
It's like you're not going to yell out 
DMT and then like,

1687
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,290
I'll just say go to itunes,
bitch,

1688
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,560
you know,
you know,

1689
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,570
at a certain point in time it's like I 
can't keep talking about the same things

1690
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:36,760
over and over again.
And that's one of them that's been.

1691
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,390
Ever since I've did conversations about 
it on a Jim Breuer show,

1692
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,900
I hate the fight.
Who's going to win versus who?

1693
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,590
Like you said that a million times,
don't ask.

1694
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:48,970
Who Do you think about this point in 
this fight?

1695
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:50,540
Who's going to win?
Well,

1696
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:53,090
no.
I know people like to talk about five,

1697
01:14:53,091 --> 01:14:55,170
so they just like to talk about it.
That's like baseball,

1698
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,150
baseball.
Well,

1699
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,020
there's a certain amount of people that 
just like that,

1700
01:14:59,021 --> 01:15:00,640
they just like to talk about it and you 
know,

1701
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:03,430
I appreciate the fact that,
you know,

1702
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:08,460
they,
they liked me as a commentator and they 

1703
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:08,460
want to know my take on things,
you know,

1704
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:08,860
and I understand that.
But you know,

1705
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:09,640
I,
I can't.

1706
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:12,250
First of all,
I wouldn't give a prediction.

1707
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:15,310
The only time I would ever give a 
prediction that something's ridiculous,

1708
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,390
you know,
like,

1709
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:19,120
you know is going to fight my mom.
I'm going to say,

1710
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:21,140
oh my mom's fucked.
Right,

1711
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:21,510
right,
right.

1712
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:27,010
You know what I'm saying?
But unless it's like that I don't get 

1713
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:27,010
predictions and those fights don't occur
in the UFC,

1714
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:28,930
the UFC fights 99 percent of them.

1715
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:33,930
Like I'm like,
what the fuck is going to happen here 

1716
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:33,930
with this,
this,

1717
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:38,011
this.
I can see a lot of scenarios taking 

1718
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:38,011
place and there's neither one of them 
is,

1719
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:40,930
is definitely for sure.
So I would never say this guy's gonna do

1720
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:41,590
this and that.
When I,

1721
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:46,610
when I hear guys,
especially the guys that have never 

1722
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:48,010
fought in anything before the they just 
sports podcasts or type dudes.

1723
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:53,250
And they're talking shit about fighters 
and like this guy doesn't belong in 

1724
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:53,250
there with them and it's going to be,
you know,

1725
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:57,880
easy work for that guy and you know,
I look for him to knock him out in the 

1726
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:57,880
first round.
Like,

1727
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,010
what are you talking about?
You're just making some crazy prediction

1728
01:16:00,011 --> 01:16:05,011
about what the fuck is going to happen 
in a fight between two skilled men that 

1729
01:16:05,011 --> 01:16:05,530
are more than capable of smashing each 
other.

1730
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:10,530
You Zig when you should zag.
Somebody cracks one the knees give out 

1731
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:11,950
and you've got a flashlight in your face
when you wake up.

1732
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:16,980
That shit is normal.
That's par for the course that happens 

1733
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:16,980
all the time.
You know?

1734
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,300
I mean people who never thought they 
were going to get knocked out,

1735
01:16:19,301 --> 01:16:21,520
getting knocked out.
It happens all the time.

1736
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,800
People get submitted when they were 
winning easily.

1737
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:27,700
You know guys who guys who no one ever 
thought we'd get submitted.

1738
01:16:27,701 --> 01:16:29,800
That dude in the wec recently got so 
many.

1739
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:31,600
Karen,
Karen dare obedient.

1740
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:34,600
I think his name is bad ass fucking 
grappler.

1741
01:16:34,601 --> 01:16:39,601
And he fucked up.
He left an arm and then this dude took 

1742
01:16:39,601 --> 01:16:39,601
his arm bar.
You can't predict there's a power outage

1743
01:16:39,601 --> 01:16:42,970
at the last use right off on,
or was it a.

1744
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:48,060
I tweeted that area and he plugged a 
vibrator and backstage and that crushed 

1745
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:51,661
the circuit breaker power adapter of it,
but she tweeted that and that it was 

1746
01:16:51,661 --> 01:16:54,030
actually my butt plug,
my vibrating but blog.

1747
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,460
So she made me feel really bad about 
that.

1748
01:16:58,930 --> 01:16:59,500
But uh,
yeah,

1749
01:16:59,501 --> 01:17:03,100
it was right before Roy Nelson flood.
Stephan struve right before they went to

1750
01:17:03,101 --> 01:17:05,230
fight the power went out.
That's never happened before.

1751
01:17:05,231 --> 01:17:10,231
It was totally a.
Did you see area one has her own shirt 

1752
01:17:10,231 --> 01:17:10,231
that they sell at uscs is now.

1753
01:17:10,231 --> 01:17:11,210
It's just,
it's just her.

1754
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,420
I'm going to get one of you should you 
wearing.

1755
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,040
That's right.
Put it on backwards.

1756
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:19,190
You know what I'm talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

1757
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:22,330
If you put it on backwards in her face 
and touching you,

1758
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,910
she's hugging you and then you put it 
onto barry white.

1759
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,880
Oh No.
Oh,

1760
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:31,640
that's who is not white.
Who was a chef from south park.

1761
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:35,180
You guys see this south park,
it's about medical marijuana.

1762
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:35,950
I know,
man,

1763
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:40,960
I'd have to see so many of them.
I have a bunch of them saved up on the 

1764
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:40,960
DVR.
South Park is the best ever.

1765
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,040
No,
no.

1766
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:44,210
Show has been consistently funny for 
this long South Park.

1767
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:46,160
That's the greatest show in the history 
of the world.

1768
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:49,070
They're the meanest.
When they go after somebody,

1769
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:50,380
they're the,
like the,

1770
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,690
the funniest,
the most fucked up it.

1771
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,440
There's no show that's even close to is 
fucked up.

1772
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:59,560
That show that they did were um,
Paris Hilton had the whore off with the 

1773
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,260
gay dude and he stuffed Paris Hilton up 
his ass.

1774
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:01,310
Like,
oh my God.

1775
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,140
Jesus Christ.
That was good.

1776
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:06,020
Yeah.
They're just so funny.

1777
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:07,430
They're like,
they'll take your place.

1778
01:18:07,431 --> 01:18:12,431
You like,
there's no way they're going to go 

1779
01:18:12,431 --> 01:18:12,431
fucking believe you did that.
You know,

1780
01:18:12,431 --> 01:18:15,080
they just do it consistently over and 
over and over again.

1781
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:18,110
It's the one,
the number one show for me,

1782
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:19,520
like,
guaranteed.

1783
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:23,970
I'm going to love it.
I want to hang with trey parker so bad.

1784
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:27,360
Maybe he will try to fuck,
you know,

1785
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:34,690
I think um,
I think,

1786
01:18:34,691 --> 01:18:39,691
uh,
he's probably one of the funniest guys 

1787
01:18:39,691 --> 01:18:39,691
ever.
As far as creativity,

1788
01:18:39,691 --> 01:18:43,190
I don't think any,
anybody has ever put out as much stuff.

1789
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,400
As prolific as he is.
No one has ever put out as much.

1790
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:48,320
Funny stuff.
Is that guy and the other guy too?

1791
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:49,190
I don't know.
I mean,

1792
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:52,010
I don't know who's writing it.
You've seen the Cannibal who writes it?

1793
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:52,750
Who,
who's writing?

1794
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:55,180
She writes everything.
Everything.

1795
01:18:55,400 --> 01:19:00,350
I think he just helps once in a while,
but it's mostly because we don't want to

1796
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:02,780
give them credit.
I know from what I understand,

1797
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:07,820
my trade just locked himself in his 
office and just mad writer and he's 

1798
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:09,470
always changing stuff and there's no 
show that's been like that.

1799
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:14,620
I mean think about what they're doing.
They have these little corny looking 

1800
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:14,620
animated dudes that they're,
you know,

1801
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,620
they're really,
really,

1802
01:19:15,621 --> 01:19:20,621
really crude.
Now the images are so crude and it's 

1803
01:19:20,621 --> 01:19:20,870
really easy to do,
you know,

1804
01:19:20,871 --> 01:19:23,540
as far as that kind of stuff is.
And then they,

1805
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:28,470
they consistently go after more shit.
And I'm sorry,

1806
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:29,900
was that.
I was going to answer it something,

1807
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,570
trevor.
They don't have a team of writers.

1808
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:37,760
Sorry.
This guy says they have a team around 

1809
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,651
him,
but he knows the people that worked 

1810
01:19:39,651 --> 01:19:39,651
there and he's actually been there 
before.

1811
01:19:39,651 --> 01:19:42,620
I think they had a team of writers at 
one point for like a season or something

1812
01:19:42,621 --> 01:19:47,621
or health writer help,
but from from my understanding now it's 

1813
01:19:47,621 --> 01:19:48,710
really just trained.
Yeah.

1814
01:19:48,711 --> 01:19:51,740
Everybody says this week's episode,
Groovy girly.

1815
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,900
Everybody says that it's the greatest 
episode over.

1816
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:59,630
Pretty ridiculous.
There's one part about it is we're so 

1817
01:19:59,630 --> 01:19:59,630
good,
man,

1818
01:19:59,630 --> 01:19:59,630
and they're so good.
It's humbling.

1819
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:00,920
It's humbling how much that God has put 
out.

1820
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:05,921
You know,
you think about the stuff that you've 

1821
01:20:05,921 --> 01:20:07,421
done,
like how productive you've been over 

1822
01:20:07,421 --> 01:20:07,421
your life and you see what that guy's 
done like Jesus Christ.

1823
01:20:07,421 --> 01:20:08,130
I just wished that team

1824
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,190
America to would happen because that 
wasn't.

1825
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:15,200
That was still.
It was the hardest movie ever for every 

1826
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:15,600
one of my.
I think that's top five.

1827
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,160
Maybe.
Maybe the first one.

1828
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:19,470
There was no,
no movie ever.

1829
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,050
The first time I saw made me laugh that 
hard.

1830
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:24,230
No movie,
no movie even came close.

1831
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,390
That was the second time.
It wasn't as funny to me,

1832
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:30,720
but the third time,
I mean it's just like it's not,

1833
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:34,130
it's the third time was just as good as 
the secretary and I still do that and it

1834
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,420
was maybe funnier than the first time I 
saw.

1835
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:40,860
I forgot how funny it was too close to a
lot of it was shocking.

1836
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,210
Yeah,
at twice,

1837
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:47,280
you know,
wanting them again five years later to 

1838
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:47,280
do that.
I didn't enjoy it.

1839
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,710
I didn't enjoy it the second time,
but I loved it so much the first time,

1840
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:55,160
you know,
there's certain things that you can't 

1841
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,811
see twice,
but certain things you can see over and 

1842
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:56,811
over and over again.

1843
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:56,811
You know,
it's funny.

1844
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:57,570
Comedies are very funny thing like that,
you know,

1845
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:02,900
like why is like really bad stuff like 
roadhouse or like showgirls or something

1846
01:21:03,181 --> 01:21:04,860
like that.
Like the more you see it,

1847
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:06,480
the funnier it is,
you know,

1848
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:11,490
you could see it like a bunch of times 
and it gets funnier because he started 

1849
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:11,540
knowing the script of it and you want to
act it out.

1850
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:17,280
There's some movies that are so 
ridiculous that it's just going,

1851
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:18,320
oh,
this one right here,

1852
01:21:18,321 --> 01:21:18,960
Howard.
The duck.

1853
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:21,810
This is Tuckey.
That movie.

1854
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:24,390
What was it called?
The adventures in babysitting.

1855
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:26,020
Nobody needs this.

1856
01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:30,240
This,
this was recommended to me.

1857
01:21:30,241 --> 01:21:33,540
I think we've talked about this.
If you want a bad movie,

1858
01:21:33,541 --> 01:21:34,560
go get this.
The room.

1859
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,420
It's fucking true.
Genius.

1860
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:38,130
Don't watch it by yourself.
It's not as fun.

1861
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:40,020
But if you watch it with some friends 
that are funny,

1862
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:42,630
it's a genius,
geniusly bad movie.

1863
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:45,240
Apparently they have screenings in 
Hollywood,

1864
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:50,290
the room,
and they'd play that movie and people 

1865
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:50,290
get there and they,
they,

1866
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:51,360
they quote the words because they,
everyone knows the words and it's like a

1867
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:53,790
sort of a rocky horror picture thing.
It's that bad.

1868
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:56,090
It's you want to borrow it?
Well,

1869
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,230
I can just make a cop.
I mean,

1870
01:21:57,410 --> 01:21:59,620
but.
And I just look at it on my computer.

1871
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:02,010
Let me just look at it on my computer 
real quick.

1872
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:06,590
I just want to know.
Let's not even do this online.

1873
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:10,010
I don't even want people to get the 
wrong impression here.

1874
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:12,090
Everyone likes fight club.
You know what man?

1875
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,890
I'll tell you what,
I didn't like fight club.

1876
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:19,160
I'd liked it.
I liked it for awhile and then when I 

1877
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:19,410
found out that the two dudes were 
actually one dude,

1878
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:20,700
I was like,
what?

1879
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:23,300
Fuck you man.
I didn't want it anymore.

1880
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,500
So I liked it up until the end movie 
rules.

1881
01:22:25,501 --> 01:22:30,501
Dude.
I didn't like it after I found out that 

1882
01:22:30,501 --> 01:22:33,291
they were supposed to be two dudes 
inside because he's punching himself in 

1883
01:22:33,291 --> 01:22:35,040
the face and yes,
that was way more believable.

1884
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:37,590
The problem is you're seeing a bunch of 
shit in this movie.

1885
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:40,620
That didn't really happen.
It's like the style of it,

1886
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:45,650
the visual Shitty to me is like,
yeah,

1887
01:22:46,411 --> 01:22:48,360
that sucks because it's not what I want 
it to be,

1888
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:51,060
but everything else along the way was so
amazing that you can't.

1889
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:54,600
It required a suspension of disbelief 
that I wasn't willing to give it.

1890
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:59,720
When all of a sudden you're telling me 
that everything I saw was just his 

1891
01:22:59,720 --> 01:22:59,850
imagination.
So this entire movie,

1892
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:03,510
what was real out of this fucking movie,
because in the movie I saw there was two

1893
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:06,010
different people and if if one part of 
it was

1894
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,800
absolutely a figment of his imagination,
what the fuck?

1895
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:10,150
What about the rest of it?
How much?

1896
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:13,210
How do I know what I'm watching anymore?
Now I'm watching nonsense.

1897
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,000
Now you have the shitty plot device 
where you can say,

1898
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:17,750
oh,
he was just a dream.

1899
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,210
Oh,
he's gone crazy.

1900
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,730
This is what's really happening.
He's hitting himself and I'm like,

1901
01:23:21,731 --> 01:23:23,620
what?
So what has really happened?

1902
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:25,210
This guy's been sitting around hating 
himself.

1903
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:27,670
There's been no real fighting.
What's really going on?

1904
01:23:27,671 --> 01:23:31,030
I think he just don't like seeing Brad 
Pitt get hurt is a part of me.

1905
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:32,670
You know what I mean?
Sloan.

1906
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:35,720
Yeah.
The.

1907
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,620
That's another funny part about that 
moving.

1908
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:39,880
You know that everybody's like,
liking,

1909
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:41,500
enjoying,
getting the fuck beat out of them.

1910
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,300
Yeah.
That's great.

1911
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:46,060
I love it.
I would hope that that's not the case in

1912
01:23:46,061 --> 01:23:47,080
real life.
I hope there is nothing.

1913
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:52,650
The real fight clubs like that,
like those old videos we used to see 

1914
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:52,650
about the fights in the yards,
the,

1915
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:57,410
what are they called,
where there's like gang fights almost 

1916
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:57,540
over in Russia.
The Russian gang fights.

1917
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:01,200
That's the same.
That's a fight club as well.

1918
01:24:01,201 --> 01:24:03,540
That's like a gang war.
Youtube.

1919
01:24:03,541 --> 01:24:06,390
Russian fights.
Russian soccer.

1920
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,450
Thug fight.
Yeah.

1921
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:10,320
Soccer fights.
They beat the fuck out of each other.

1922
01:24:10,321 --> 01:24:12,000
We've talked about that on there before.
That's.

1923
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:13,300
Yeah,
those guys are nuts.

1924
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:15,030
Russians.
There's a there.

1925
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,730
A different breed song that's a hardy 
race.

1926
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:19,860
I'm affected as video,
so the Russians,

1927
01:24:19,861 --> 01:24:21,190
they loved the Bra size.

1928
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,120
My Fan.
Norm Mcdonald.

1929
01:24:24,121 --> 01:24:29,121
Huge Fan.
Normally Donald's one of my favorite 

1930
01:24:29,121 --> 01:24:29,121
comedians.
Each fucking hilarious.

1931
01:24:29,121 --> 01:24:31,440
Norm.
Macdonald is a very unique dude.

1932
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:34,540
There's something really just funny 
about him.

1933
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:38,040
Go canoeing with him to.
To him about anything.

1934
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:39,540
He's one of those dudes.
Just want to talk to.

1935
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,660
I want to fight club to be a buddy film.
Hey,

1936
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:46,950
fuck you man.
Fuck you hector.

1937
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,110
While you got some crazy shit going on 
with your name.

1938
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:52,290
Dang goose,
esquire.

1939
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:54,720
Wow.
I like your avatar though.

1940
01:24:54,721 --> 01:24:56,830
That's pretty dope.
Blinking third eye,

1941
01:24:57,950 --> 01:25:01,550
your crafting internet hacker.
You have.

1942
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:02,850
I seen Donnie Darko.
Yeah,

1943
01:25:02,851 --> 01:25:07,851
I liked that a lot.
I thought that was an interesting 

1944
01:25:07,851 --> 01:25:07,851
little.
Yeah,

1945
01:25:07,851 --> 01:25:07,851
I see it.
It was pretty interesting,

1946
01:25:07,851 --> 01:25:08,400
man.
Donnie Darko,

1947
01:25:08,401 --> 01:25:09,840
and don't get me wrong,
I love fight.

1948
01:25:09,841 --> 01:25:13,620
I mean if I had to see fight club again,
I would watch it up until the moment.

1949
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:18,650
I would watch it up until the moment 
where you find out it's two people not 

1950
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:18,650
to shut it off because I liked it up 
until that,

1951
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:19,810
you know,
just.

1952
01:25:19,910 --> 01:25:21,600
I don't like that.
That's what I liked about.

1953
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,670
Didn't like about shutter island.
I don't like when you say,

1954
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:24,810
oh,
it was all trek,

1955
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:25,620
you know,
don't,

1956
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:27,120
don't give me that.
I don't want to hear it.

1957
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:29,990
That's nonsense.
Show me a real goddamn moment,

1958
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:35,170
you know?
That's why I like the Avatar was so 

1959
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:35,170
cool.

1960
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:37,610
I have a feeling lost my face up.
I'm thinking the last recent episodes.

1961
01:25:38,311 --> 01:25:42,060
It's interesting,
but it's also like this could get really

1962
01:25:42,061 --> 01:25:44,490
bad,
bad that it could.

1963
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:47,910
Like it has the potential to be ending 
in a way that you're just like,

1964
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:49,200
are you kidding me?

1965
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:54,940
I think this year it just seems silly,
leaping back and forth and time.

1966
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:57,160
No,
just one.

1967
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:59,960
Once they hit the nuclear bomb and went 
back in time,

1968
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:01,370
I was like,
what is happening?

1969
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,680
What's going on?
Shut up.

1970
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:08,740
You can't just.
Nuclear jumped back and forth through 

1971
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:08,740
time,
you know,

1972
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:08,870
stop it.
Just stop it.

1973
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,630
I need more.
I need more from you than that.

1974
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:15,440
I need a little more than you blow off a
nuclear weapon and we go back in time.

1975
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:19,250
That's so stupid.
It was just,

1976
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,380
it's too dumb.
And then where are we now?

1977
01:26:21,381 --> 01:26:22,750
We're in 1977.
What do we do?

1978
01:26:22,751 --> 01:26:23,260
Well,
you know,

1979
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:24,710
you would be shitting your pants.
Come on.

1980
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:26,240
Fuck.
We're stuck in 77.

1981
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:28,320
No Internet.
You know,

1982
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:33,340
even refrigerators sucked back then.
Nothing was good that the cars were all 

1983
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:34,190
shitty.
The brakes were up.

1984
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:37,610
Barely stopped for anything.
Dude.

1985
01:26:37,611 --> 01:26:38,540
It sucked back then.

1986
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:40,940
Everything sucked.
It would suck.

1987
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:43,290
If you had to live back at 77.
Fuck that.

1988
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:46,530
Fuck that.
It would suck to accounting back.

1989
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:52,580
Yeah.
They would shoot you if they so weed on 

1990
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:53,600
you.
We was totally illegal back then.

1991
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:57,860
I have not seen Michael Rupert's film 
collapse,

1992
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:00,800
but I heard it's really good.
That guy scares the shit out of me.

1993
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:03,050
Netflix.
Watch it.

1994
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:05,920
He's one of those end of the world.
Dudes is collapse on Netflix.

1995
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:10,960
Sure is fine.
I thought it was only out in the movies 

1996
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:11,660
or something.
I don't know.

1997
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:15,590
Find out google that shit's collapse at 
ups.

1998
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:19,180
Probably some fucking nine slash 11 
shit,

1999
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:22,360
isn't it Michael?
Rupert Shit is A.

2000
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:27,370
I think it's all about peak oil and he's
the guy that exposed the CIA or selling 

2001
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:28,670
drugs in movies.
Theater.

2002
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:33,680
Still a DVD unknown.
Let's check out

2003
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:42,380
the rest of the questions we have here 
on the message board because it was a 

2004
01:27:43,201 --> 01:27:46,260
bunch of them up here.
I'm like I said we.

2005
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:49,200
We had have stopped last week because I 
had a staph infection.

2006
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:50,090
I had a little.

2007
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:53,000
We should mention our friend outlawed.
Did we talk about that past?

2008
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:58,120
The good friend outlaw from Joe's 
message board has passed and he was a 

2009
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:02,420
great guy and we all love him very much 
and really much thought to his wife.

2010
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:04,570
Yeah,
much much love.

2011
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:08,050
He was a really fun guy.
He was a dude that was a,

2012
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,420
all my message board from the beginning.
Really.

2013
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:12,280
I can't remember when he was never 
there.

2014
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:13,510
I mean,
I don't remember a time.

2015
01:28:13,690 --> 01:28:15,370
There was one time where he,
um,

2016
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:19,150
he took off for awhile and uh,
I called them at home.

2017
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:20,580
I got his,
uh,

2018
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:25,690
information from somebody I call them at
home and I found out that his brother 

2019
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:25,690
had,
uh,

2020
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:26,630
died recently and he had some,
uh,

2021
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:30,910
some real serious family issues and he 
was very depressed and um,

2022
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,900
you know,
I talked to him and he was,

2023
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:38,930
it was,
it was nice to know that he was okay 

2024
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:40,711
physically,
but he was real sad and then he came 

2025
01:28:40,711 --> 01:28:43,471
back and eventually became his old self 
again and he was just one of the 

2026
01:28:43,471 --> 01:28:44,020
funniest posters,
man.

2027
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:45,880
Dude was so,
like quick,

2028
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:51,210
really witty and apparently according to
his wife he had always wanted to be a 

2029
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:55,021
standup comedian.
And that's one of the reasons why he 

2030
01:28:55,021 --> 01:28:57,901
liked to hang out on my board because he
got to chance to like really be an 

2031
01:28:57,901 --> 01:28:57,901
online comedian,
you know?

2032
01:28:57,901 --> 01:28:59,500
I mean,
that's like a real thing.

2033
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,180
Now,
what we've talked about this before,

2034
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:02,490
there are dudes

2035
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,100
and message boards are like,
they're,

2036
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:07,110
they're comedy stage.
You know,

2037
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:10,040
like you're a good example of that.
You're,

2038
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:11,160
I,
I consider you,

2039
01:29:11,161 --> 01:29:13,230
I mean you've done standup comedy a few 
times,

2040
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:18,590
but I consider you like an internet 
comedian because you make these little 

2041
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:18,900
videos that are funny and you've put 
them up on the Internet.

2042
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:22,400
Well the problem is it's just like a,
you spend so much time at five hours,

2043
01:29:22,401 --> 01:29:27,401
you're spending a ton of hours just you 
can get three to five minutes in front 

2044
01:29:27,401 --> 01:29:29,510
of eight people.
I could spend the same amount of time,

2045
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:31,670
make a video that thousands.
We'll see.

2046
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:36,760
So it's like,
why would I want to do it on stage when 

2047
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:36,760
I could do the same thing on the 
Internet and get $50,

2048
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,000
million times more people seeing it.

2049
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,220
Right?
And then eventually,

2050
01:29:39,221 --> 01:29:40,510
like I said,
with the red thing,

2051
01:29:40,511 --> 01:29:43,090
if you get enough people to see your 
shit on the Internet,

2052
01:29:43,091 --> 01:29:44,860
you can develop like an immigrant 
community.

2053
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:46,810
I could go on and then you can go do a 
show,

2054
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:52,400
you know?
And that's what the kind of shit that 

2055
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:52,960
already really needs to take advantage 
of because Ari has a name.

2056
01:29:52,961 --> 01:29:55,030
I mean,
he's been opening up for me for years.

2057
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,250
Thousands of people have seen it because
of that.

2058
01:29:57,490 --> 01:30:00,370
And then he's been on the Jim Norton 
show,

2059
01:30:00,371 --> 01:30:05,371
a down and dirty with Jim Norton and 
he's got a lot of clips on the Internet 

2060
01:30:05,371 --> 01:30:06,760
and he's been on opiod.
Anthea with me a bunch of times.

2061
01:30:06,761 --> 01:30:08,260
He was on the last time when I was 
there.

2062
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:12,970
So he's got enough stuff happening that 
he should have like a community.

2063
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:15,360
And so it's just a matter of putting it 
together.

2064
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:19,750
That's why it's so much better now than 
it's ever been before for comedians.

2065
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:22,270
And my message board is one of the best 
parts about it.

2066
01:30:22,271 --> 01:30:25,600
And this dude outlaw was one of the best
parts about my message board.

2067
01:30:25,601 --> 01:30:28,510
He was a great guy.
He was really funny and he was,

2068
01:30:28,511 --> 01:30:29,350
uh,
just,

2069
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,180
uh,
we,

2070
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:35,200
we got a chance to hang out with them in
real life a few times once way back in 

2071
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:35,200
Houston,
way,

2072
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:38,470
way back in the day.
It was how many years ago was at seven,

2073
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:43,690
seven years ago and then again recently 
last year he came to Dallas and what are

2074
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:47,860
one or two other times other than that 
to at least one,

2075
01:30:47,861 --> 01:30:48,400
but I can remember

2076
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:51,080
one of the saddest things for me is 
going to his facebook page.

2077
01:30:51,081 --> 01:30:54,230
His and his photos.
I forgot for Christmas last year.

2078
01:30:54,231 --> 01:30:58,010
I think for Christmas I sent them a 
photo of me shaving my chest going,

2079
01:30:58,070 --> 01:31:03,070
Ooh,
not really shaving my chest but like a 

2080
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:04,370
photo of me and just as a joke because 
that's how our relationship all were.

2081
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,900
What was on the Internet,
like photoshops back and forth,

2082
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:11,910
you silly photos and stuff.
And so like then I went to his facebook 

2083
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:12,500
and he has that on his facebook page and
I'm like,

2084
01:31:12,501 --> 01:31:14,930
oh that fucking photo for caterpillar.
That

2085
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:18,720
was one of the cool things about the 
message board is like,

2086
01:31:18,721 --> 01:31:21,360
you know,
we have like these online friends,

2087
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:23,130
you know,
there really are online friends.

2088
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:28,190
Some of them you never meet.
Some of them they're just that just 

2089
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:31,131
exist online.
And as long as your personality is cool 

2090
01:31:31,131 --> 01:31:31,131
and you're friendly and you're funny,
you know,

2091
01:31:31,131 --> 01:31:33,150
you eventually get into the whole mix 
there,

2092
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:38,360
you know,
and that's what's encouraged funniness 

2093
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,350
and personality and an openness and the,
the idea,

2094
01:31:40,351 --> 01:31:40,910
you know,
that,

2095
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:45,980
you know,
you don't have to fucking get in fights 

2096
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:47,841
with everybody you talk to online and 
that if you do say something to 

2097
01:31:47,841 --> 01:31:47,841
somebody,
a better be funny,

2098
01:31:47,841 --> 01:31:48,270
you know,
you're going to be a Douche,

2099
01:31:48,271 --> 01:31:49,620
but sounds like it should be really 
funny,

2100
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:54,960
you know.
And it's nice to have something like 

2101
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:54,960
that and,
you know,

2102
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,820
it's nice to get a chance to meet cool 
people that I probably would never meet 

2103
01:31:58,820 --> 01:31:59,980
in real life like you or like outlaw you
or like,

2104
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,720
you know,
Tony Z or,

2105
01:32:01,721 --> 01:32:02,590
you know,
I mean,

2106
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:06,010
there's a lot of people now and there's 
a lot of people that we've,

2107
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:07,930
uh,
we've met online.

2108
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,000
Bad Bobby,
you know,

2109
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:11,500
it was really cool guys.
And I look forward to seeing you when I,

2110
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:16,620
when I'm in town and I see him,
it's fun to hang with johnny rotten and 

2111
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:18,970
johnny rotten and yeah,
Jane Flower and her husband Henry,

2112
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:20,230
you know,
let me say this,

2113
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:22,090
a bunch of people that we met that are 
really cool,

2114
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:23,230
you know,
and it's,

2115
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,640
it's,
it's a nice thing,

2116
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,860
you know,
to have cultivated,

2117
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:31,920
you know,
and I'm just happy that we got a chance 

2118
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:31,920
to hang out with this guy and I'm,
I'm,

2119
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:36,130
I'm happy that uh,
we were in his life and that he took 

2120
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:40,201
pleasure in hanging out on my message 
board and one of the best artist I know 

2121
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:45,430
too.
And it's crazy that he wasn't making 

2122
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:45,430
millions from his art.
Yeah,

2123
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:46,570
he was,
he was a really creative guy.

2124
01:32:46,571 --> 01:32:47,230
Just,
you know,

2125
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:52,260
first of all he was in Oklahoma and it 
didn't feel like you had a lot of 

2126
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:52,260
opportunities around them,
you know,

2127
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:56,701
all the time.
He just didn't feel like that many 

2128
01:32:56,701 --> 01:32:56,701
things were,
uh,

2129
01:32:56,701 --> 01:32:58,750
available to him.
But he was a great guy.

2130
01:32:58,751 --> 01:32:59,920
Man.
Sucks.

2131
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:02,980
Really does suck.
And he was fairly young.

2132
01:33:02,981 --> 01:33:04,120
Right.
How old is he?

2133
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:05,720
My Age,
35,

2134
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,120
so I'm kind of paranoid.
Scared now.

2135
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:11,240
I've been eating Broccoli a lot lately.
I've been eating radishes,

2136
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:14,010
radishes.
This guy will.

2137
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:15,150
Yeah.
I,

2138
01:33:15,151 --> 01:33:20,151
uh,
I've been cleaning up my diet a lot 

2139
01:33:20,151 --> 01:33:20,151
lately.
I've been eating a lot more shit.

2140
01:33:20,151 --> 01:33:21,660
It's important to take care of your 
health man.

2141
01:33:21,661 --> 01:33:26,100
And people don't appreciate that respect
that it's so easy to eat shitty.

2142
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:27,690
It tastes good,
you know,

2143
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:32,900
tastes good.
Eat fucking cheeseburgers with shit 

2144
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,911
sauce.
And then we always give a hard time 

2145
01:33:34,911 --> 01:33:34,911
about it.
And he's

2146
01:33:34,911 --> 01:33:34,911
was.
Did you see the photo?

2147
01:33:34,911 --> 01:33:36,930
He twitted when you,
when you guys were in North Carolina,

2148
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:39,460
have the barbecue,
have no of his uh,

2149
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:41,430
what he ate that night?
No,

2150
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:45,450
it was like potato chips.
MNMS beef jerky.

2151
01:33:45,451 --> 01:33:47,480
Ho hos like,
look at the photo.

2152
01:33:47,481 --> 01:33:49,740
It's on his twitter and backslash.
Ari Shaffir.

2153
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:52,320
He does put away some junk food dude.
It was like,

2154
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:55,530
all right.
That right there is like nipple cancer,

2155
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,640
you know,
he killed them.

2156
01:33:56,641 --> 01:33:57,030
Charlotte.

2157
01:33:57,050 --> 01:33:59,170
I've had a really good set and try to 
blow it up.

2158
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,410
He was really good.
Cool.

2159
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:03,050
He was in New York doing going up a lot 
in New York.

2160
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:04,680
Yeah,
you're,

2161
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,130
it's pretty cool.
But never lived there.

2162
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,430
Thinking about living there and just 
thinking about I'm making a movie.

2163
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:10,340
That's crazy.
People maybe be good for him,

2164
01:34:10,341 --> 01:34:12,260
you know,
maybe do something totally different.

2165
01:34:12,261 --> 01:34:13,790
Mix it up,
you know,

2166
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:18,880
that's a,
that's a crazy that I have never 

2167
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,640
experienced in my life to be in a head 
different head space.

2168
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:24,670
I used to log in,
I liked you want to go back there a 

2169
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:26,471
little bit,
but part of it is just I know people 

2170
01:34:26,471 --> 01:34:27,410
there and you know,
and I liked her for a quick jolt.

2171
01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:29,240
Get in there and get out of there.
You know,

2172
01:34:29,241 --> 01:34:32,240
I love going on opiod Anthony.
I love meeting my old pool plan.

2173
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:32,700
Frowns.

2174
01:34:32,850 --> 01:34:37,850
I'd be an alcoholic immediately looming.
It seems like that's the only thing to 

2175
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:38,430
do.
And plus when we came back off the plane

2176
01:34:38,431 --> 01:34:40,920
in California after they're just seeing 
nature scene,

2177
01:34:40,921 --> 01:34:43,170
grassy fields and trees,
I'm like,

2178
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:48,380
oh my God,
I didn't see any of that when I was in 

2179
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:50,181
New York.
This is the perfect time to be driving 

2180
01:34:50,181 --> 01:34:50,181
around California.
It's right after you.

2181
01:34:50,181 --> 01:34:51,990
Yeah,
everything's green if it sounds gay,

2182
01:34:51,991 --> 01:34:54,240
but when I'm getting the mail and it 
smells like roses,

2183
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:55,320
you're just like,
wow,

2184
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:57,320
this is so much better to shit.

2185
01:34:58,290 --> 01:35:03,290
There's.
There's something to be said definitely 

2186
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:03,290
for that and there's definitely 
something to be said.

2187
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:06,120
It's not natural to live stack 70 people
on top of each other.

2188
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:10,350
They've done like those population 
density studies with rats and they found

2189
01:35:10,351 --> 01:35:12,360
that if they have a certain amount of 
rats in a box,

2190
01:35:12,361 --> 01:35:15,000
everyone's cool,
but the more rats you add to the box,

2191
01:35:15,001 --> 01:35:17,970
the more fucked up behavior starts 
manifesting itself.

2192
01:35:17,971 --> 01:35:21,300
There's starts.
A lot of them become neurotic.

2193
01:35:21,301 --> 01:35:26,301
They started like tweaking and some of 
them like become duddy and they sit by 

2194
01:35:26,301 --> 01:35:26,301
themselves and shake.
They.

2195
01:35:26,301 --> 01:35:31,000
They develop all this nutty sensory 
overload ship because there's too many 

2196
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:31,680
rasters started attacking each other and
getting violent.

2197
01:35:31,950 --> 01:35:34,530
It gets bad man and that's what happens 
when fucking people.

2198
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,540
When I was in North Carolina last week,
man,

2199
01:35:36,810 --> 01:35:38,640
it was a couple of days ago,
it was like North Carolina.

2200
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:40,020
You could smell it.

2201
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:40,920
Man.
It was nice to.

2202
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:43,000
Everybody was cool right out to.
Yeah,

2203
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:44,450
you go to restaurants.
How you doing?

2204
01:35:44,451 --> 01:35:47,030
How can we help you out?
Or would you like something to drink?

2205
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:49,850
Like everyone's like tying to move there
and hang out with cliff.

2206
01:35:49,851 --> 01:35:50,780
He be now,
right?

2207
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:52,200
He lives in Raleigh.
That's even,

2208
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,460
I would just need to play.
Well,

2209
01:35:53,461 --> 01:35:54,120
you know,
Raleigh,

2210
01:35:54,121 --> 01:35:59,121
I could fucking do stand up there.
I can always just turn up with Charlie 

2211
01:35:59,121 --> 01:35:59,550
goodnight's,
you know,

2212
01:36:00,610 --> 01:36:03,760
that's a good club.
Easily takeover child.

2213
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:08,100
Good nights during the week to show it 
hurricanes.

2214
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:08,900
No,
fuck.

2215
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:09,990
That sucks.
Hard Dude.

2216
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:12,470
One of the waitresses at the place we 
ate,

2217
01:36:12,471 --> 01:36:15,300
we had this cool barbecue place and the 
waitress said to us,

2218
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:16,430
uh,
that uh,

2219
01:36:16,690 --> 01:36:18,660
uh,
hurricane came and uh,

2220
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,920
picked up her neighbor's house and 
dropped it.

2221
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:25,080
Paul would them in it.
They were in their fucking house.

2222
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,120
It picked,
it's not a mobile house.

2223
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:32,180
A house picked her house up and fucking 
fluid like 30 yards down the road into a

2224
01:36:32,521 --> 01:36:33,330
pond.
You know,

2225
01:36:33,331 --> 01:36:38,331
I totally forgot about storms.
I just hate being around tornadoes and 

2226
01:36:38,331 --> 01:36:40,380
storms.
Fucking whether living in Ohio has raped

2227
01:36:40,381 --> 01:36:45,381
me of like,
I'm scared of fucking lightning now 

2228
01:36:45,381 --> 01:36:45,381
because I've just been through so much 
fucking crap.

2229
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:48,880
I think the move is a smaller town in 
California.

2230
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:52,840
I think San Diego or Santa Barbara 
Diego's not a bad,

2231
01:36:52,841 --> 01:36:55,880
but San Diego is so close to Barbara 
that's funded buyers now.

2232
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:58,540
That's not a bad one.
Santa Barbara is a good call.

2233
01:36:58,570 --> 01:37:03,570
God,
that's a good call because it's still 

2234
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:03,570
like they have good restaurants,
diversity of babies.

2235
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:08,580
So yeah man,
there's a university there so that 

2236
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:08,580
people could,
uh,

2237
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:09,610
that's a good jail.
I love that jail.

2238
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:12,610
It's awesome.
Look up the um,

2239
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:14,080
the,
there's a university up there,

2240
01:37:14,081 --> 01:37:14,500
a couple.

2241
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,810
I think there's more than one,
right?

2242
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:19,210
Yeah.
And then this line is good Jujitsu up.

2243
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:24,220
There was no comedy club up there,
but you could do something around a 

2244
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:28,470
campfire at this point.
I'm really seriously thinking about 

2245
01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:30,070
getting some regular gig somewhere.
Just have a campfire,

2246
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:33,610
a campfire in a winery.
Tickets are $25 a year.

2247
01:37:33,611 --> 01:37:34,330
Just,
you know,

2248
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:37,050
doing a Gig like in Vegas,
like every week.

2249
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:42,390
The that's the to place.
You could do it every week because new 

2250
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,390
people come in every week,
you know,

2251
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:45,900
there's always people coming in,
but vegas is just so bad,

2252
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:49,650
so bad for you.
It's not good to stay there.

2253
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:52,620
Vegas is like,
it's like smoking cigarettes.

2254
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:54,750
It's like you can get away with it for a
long time.

2255
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,030
Eventually it's gonna get

2256
01:37:56,200 --> 01:38:01,200
you know or,
or you could not do it and then you get 

2257
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:01,390
hit by a bus tomorrow and you're like,
oh,

2258
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:02,380
I don't know.

2259
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:04,290
Like I never say I should've moved to 
Vegas,

2260
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:06,960
but I think doing a Gig in Vegas,
even if I did it,

2261
01:38:06,961 --> 01:38:10,230
I'd still wouldn't live there.
I would fly in and you know,

2262
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:15,310
on the weekends I wouldn't be able to do
like one of those five nights a week 

2263
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:15,570
gigs.
I can't do five nights a week.

2264
01:38:15,571 --> 01:38:20,571
I'll lose my marbles for sure.
Five nights a week to I'm not going to 

2265
01:38:20,571 --> 01:38:21,950
be funny.
You know,

2266
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:25,800
comedy,
a lot of it is a based on enthusiasm and

2267
01:38:25,801 --> 01:38:28,770
I think if I did every night I had to do
five nights a week.

2268
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:30,540
I don't think I would be as 
enthusiastic.

2269
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:35,570
I like little days off sometimes on the 
weekend off here and it gets the juices 

2270
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:37,890
all fired up and that's the best way to 
try to create new material to.

2271
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:42,510
You can't create new material if you're 
always doing long headlines sets all the

2272
01:38:42,511 --> 01:38:42,870
time.

2273
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:47,900
I think the better way to do it is to 
just really sit down and try to break 

2274
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:49,350
out some new ideas then just go up and 
try them on their own.

2275
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,000
You know,
it's the,

2276
01:38:51,001 --> 01:38:53,790
I used to introduce them to bits,
but sometimes you know,

2277
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:55,080
introduce them like in the middle of 
bits.

2278
01:38:55,081 --> 01:39:00,081
And I still do that sometimes,
but I think maybe the best way to do is 

2279
01:39:00,081 --> 01:39:02,511
just go on stage,
like some crappy open mic night or 

2280
01:39:02,511 --> 01:39:02,511
something like that.
You know,

2281
01:39:02,511 --> 01:39:07,190
you gotta make sure there's some.
I think I'm going to do that at the 

2282
01:39:07,190 --> 01:39:07,190
Improv.
I'm going to do a,

2283
01:39:07,190 --> 01:39:07,330
the ideas,
uh,

2284
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:08,520
uh,
new shit show.

2285
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:13,920
Do a show a real cheap so that the club 
gets something like five bucks or 

2286
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,290
something like that.
And then just work on all new material,

2287
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:18,150
you know,
not even have an opening act,

2288
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:19,500
nothing.
Then I was just meeting,

2289
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,960
go up like an hour and a half or 
something like that.

2290
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:23,360
You know,
I'm thinking about doing that.

2291
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:25,680
I think that's,
that might be a good mood.

2292
01:39:25,681 --> 01:39:28,230
I want to try all sorts of different 
stuff to come up with new material,

2293
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:29,910
you know?
I mean,

2294
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:33,030
you can only get in the isolation tank 
so many times.

2295
01:39:33,031 --> 01:39:34,320
He only look online so many times

2296
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:37,490
I'm going to canoe.
I'm misconstruing like crazy.

2297
01:39:37,491 --> 01:39:39,350
Do you ever get really stoned and go 
canoeing?

2298
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:44,800
It was the best man.
They were just going through nature and 

2299
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,891
this in this boat.
Once in a while it gets crazy right now 

2300
01:39:47,891 --> 01:39:47,930
we're going to die and then you're back 
to peace.

2301
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:51,200
It is so fun.
I'm not until I put myself in that,

2302
01:39:51,201 --> 01:39:52,330
oh my God,
you're almost done.

2303
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:53,980
Canoeing is like.
I mean,

2304
01:39:54,110 --> 01:39:55,860
it just gets a little rapping like 
you're like this,

2305
01:39:56,210 --> 01:39:58,250
but it's not like people all pools and 
stuff.

2306
01:39:58,251 --> 01:40:03,251
People died.
There was a reality show that they were 

2307
01:40:03,251 --> 01:40:03,251
filming for.
Um,

2308
01:40:03,251 --> 01:40:03,290
I forget what you could stand in it.
It's like this,

2309
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:05,760
like this team.
It's not like this girl was

2310
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:09,200
white.
She was white water canal and uh,

2311
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:11,440
it went under and she should have been 
okay,

2312
01:40:11,441 --> 01:40:16,441
but she hit her head and her head 
somehow or another got wedged between 

2313
01:40:16,441 --> 01:40:20,051
two rocks and she got stuck so she went 
out and got stuck under and they had to 

2314
01:40:20,051 --> 01:40:20,051
go under

2315
01:40:20,051 --> 01:40:20,640
or out.
It's crazy.

2316
01:40:20,641 --> 01:40:22,030
Can you imagine the canoeing?
I did.

2317
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:24,540
I've been going since I was a kid.
And it's like,

2318
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:28,620
it's for babies.
It's so peaceful and fun in your life.

2319
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:32,900
People like stop and Margo and a lake,
you know,

2320
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:34,110
like Oh yeah,
like to.

2321
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:35,190
I just don't like it.
Cool.

2322
01:40:35,191 --> 01:40:36,010
Yeah.
I just

2323
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:40,730
downwards like letting the boat go into 
rocks and shit.

2324
01:40:40,810 --> 01:40:42,310
I try to avoid those.
Oh No.

2325
01:40:42,311 --> 01:40:42,790
Left,
left,

2326
01:40:42,791 --> 01:40:43,480
left.
No,

2327
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:46,760
you don't have any desire to put myself 
in the situation.

2328
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:51,800
Wow.
I'm trying not to have the fucking 

2329
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:51,800
canoed tip over

2330
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:51,800
you.
Just,

2331
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,580
you don't like the Hickey Water?
No,

2332
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:59,200
no.
Another thing it would freak me out is 

2333
01:40:59,200 --> 01:40:59,200
that's how

2334
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:00,420
one that I'm vbs dot TV show about the 
Arctic.

2335
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:05,630
Remember there was at one dude,
I think his name was [inaudible] and he 

2336
01:41:05,630 --> 01:41:08,691
lives in Alaska and northeast Alaska.
Their daughter fell off the boat when it

2337
01:41:08,721 --> 01:41:09,900
was.
She was two years old.

2338
01:41:09,901 --> 01:41:14,901
They were,
they were living up there in the 

2339
01:41:14,901 --> 01:41:14,901
fucking,
the Yukon,

2340
01:41:14,901 --> 01:41:14,901
wherever the hell it is up there.
What is it called up there?

2341
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:17,460
North Arctic,
whatever the fuck it is.

2342
01:41:17,490 --> 01:41:19,230
I mean these way in the Arctic Circle,
whatever.

2343
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:21,450
He's waiting to fuck up their deep,
deep,

2344
01:41:21,451 --> 01:41:23,870
deep into Alaska and his,
uh,

2345
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:27,930
they were on a river with a canoe and 
the canoe tipped over and their daughter

2346
01:41:27,931 --> 01:41:32,931
was two years old and she drowned and 
all they ever found was her little boot 

2347
01:41:32,931 --> 01:41:33,810
and that,
that killed me.

2348
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:36,900
That story killed me.
And every year they go to this site,

2349
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,960
like near where where it happened and 
they plant flowers because I wasn't 

2350
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:42,750
flowers like ribbons because there's no 
flowers up there.

2351
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,570
And it was sad as fuck by watching them 
cry.

2352
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:50,660
And they had two grown daughters,
like the edit to two daughters 

2353
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:52,971
afterwards,
but it's still crushed them thinking 

2354
01:41:52,971 --> 01:41:52,971
about their two year old that drowned in
their canoe.

2355
01:41:52,971 --> 01:41:54,410
Fuck a canoe,
narrow,

2356
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:55,340
narrow,
narrow,

2357
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:56,110
narrow,
narrow,

2358
01:41:56,250 --> 01:42:01,250
not interested,
not interested in putting my life at 

2359
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:01,800
risk for some fucking natural river 
ride.

2360
01:42:01,801 --> 01:42:03,330
Thrill.
Not Interesting.

2361
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:05,760
No.
I mean I understand that this might be a

2362
01:42:05,761 --> 01:42:10,761
thrill,
but my logic will not let me get past a 

2363
01:42:10,761 --> 01:42:13,980
risk to benefit ratio.
I look at it and I get angry with myself

2364
01:42:13,981 --> 01:42:16,260
for even thinking about trying.
It just seems like it's dumb.

2365
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:17,610
Know.
Yeah,

2366
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:19,560
so good luck on your boat.
Faggot.

2367
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:21,210
What else?

2368
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:25,720
Two thousand 12 tour with Stan.
Hope is well.

2369
01:42:25,721 --> 01:42:29,550
Last time Stan hope and I talked.
He wanted to do it and I want to do it.

2370
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:34,820
I think that would be awesome.
Have an end of the world show and then 

2371
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:39,120
the real end of the world would be that 
the world wouldn't end ever ever read 

2372
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,320
book.
Behold a pale horse.

2373
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:45,350
Yeah.
I think it's not that you think it's a 

2374
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:45,350
great conspiracy book.
Death rock dance.

2375
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:50,600
I thought it was a bad book.
I thought that guy sounds like he's 

2376
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:53,520
enough.
Sounds like either he's crazy or he's 

2377
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:57,351
like a disinflation guy and there are 
people without a doubt who are paid to 

2378
01:42:57,661 --> 01:43:02,661
say things that seem like nonsense and 
say those nonsense things along with 

2379
01:43:02,661 --> 01:43:07,521
things that do make sense and are true 
and real and thereby the nonsense 

2380
01:43:07,741 --> 01:43:09,660
discredits the real information.
So,

2381
01:43:09,661 --> 01:43:11,400
you know,
if someone says like,

2382
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:12,970
did you know that,
you know,

2383
01:43:12,971 --> 01:43:13,310
uh,
the,

2384
01:43:13,311 --> 01:43:16,920
the government did this in 1970 and then
you can go,

2385
01:43:16,921 --> 01:43:17,490
oh really?

2386
01:43:17,490 --> 01:43:18,770
Where'd you read that?
And you go,

2387
01:43:18,771 --> 01:43:20,700
well,
I read it from William Cooper's book.

2388
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:25,730
You know,
I'm not the guy that believes there's 

2389
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:26,010
alien bases on the moon that are 
watching us and that there's information

2390
01:43:26,011 --> 01:43:27,330
that they have given us to.
Oh,

2391
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:28,170
come on,
man,

2392
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,250
that guy sounds like a balloon.
He sounds fucking crazy.

2393
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:36,120
He's a guy that also said that the 
driver is the one who killed Kennedy.

2394
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:41,240
He believes that the driver,
the driver turned around and shot 

2395
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:42,720
Kennedy and then could clearly see it 
and there's a or felt like he's nuts.

2396
01:43:42,930 --> 01:43:43,800
He says,
shit,

2397
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:48,801
that's so nutty.
I have to believe there's one or two 

2398
01:43:48,801 --> 01:43:53,031
options,
either he's completely out of his 

2399
01:43:53,031 --> 01:43:53,031
fucking mind and people just believed 
him

2400
01:43:53,031 --> 01:43:56,180
or he's a plant.
He's a guy that they hired to,

2401
01:43:56,240 --> 01:44:01,010
to distribute this information to make 
things and theories appear ridiculous.

2402
01:44:01,011 --> 01:44:03,710
It's very possible that he's,
that there's definitely people that do,

2403
01:44:03,711 --> 01:44:08,711
that.
There's people that have admitted that 

2404
01:44:08,711 --> 01:44:09,150
the government hires people to blog,
hires people to uh,

2405
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:12,440
go online and post on message boards and
debate issues.

2406
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:17,600
Anytime anything specific comes up,
they have guys that they'll send on that

2407
01:44:17,601 --> 01:44:22,601
issue if they believe that this is 
causing descent and some sort of a meme 

2408
01:44:22,601 --> 01:44:23,750
of consciousness if they can avoid,
you know,

2409
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:25,790
they'll attack it.
They'll try to discredit things,

2410
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:28,400
you know,
it says means pretty standard.

2411
01:44:28,401 --> 01:44:29,480
I mean,
they would have to do that.

2412
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:31,330
They've got to realize how big the 
Internet is

2413
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:34,650
as you hold that fucking hard drive 
noise.

2414
01:44:34,651 --> 01:44:39,140
My computer's about to die.
Flash player support safari.

2415
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,030
Fuck you.
They want me to send in a report.

2416
01:44:42,031 --> 01:44:47,031
You know your shit.
So actually I get a recording flash 

2417
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:47,031
buyers guide.
Well,

2418
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,140
it quit on safari browser.
It didn't quit on Firefox.

2419
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,870
Safari can soccer.
Oh,

2420
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:55,110
ficus.
Flash,

2421
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,500
flash to html.
Five point.

2422
01:44:58,501 --> 01:44:59,150
Oh,
somebody.

2423
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:04,160
They made it into two.
You could play quake two in your 

2424
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,550
browser.
60 frames per second.

2425
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,810
Just going to a website.
This,

2426
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:09,680
this guy's hilarious.
The government is.

2427
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:13,530
I wonder if you tell them the truth.
Let me start shaking my keys.

2428
01:45:13,531 --> 01:45:18,531
Every time I talk to you shaking your 
community that help my friend and have 

2429
01:45:20,491 --> 01:45:22,080
to do that because they,
they,

2430
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:24,020
their mind wanders.
So sigma keys.

2431
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:25,710
I was just listening to what this guy 
wrote.

2432
01:45:25,711 --> 01:45:28,710
The government is only out to protect 
itself from the rest of us.

2433
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:32,220
I wonder if he's being serious.
Some people really think like that.

2434
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,820
We got my to do that because otherwise 
people would overthrow the government.

2435
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:39,220
The whole idea is,
you're not supposed to say this,

2436
01:45:39,221 --> 01:45:44,221
but the whole idea that everybody should
have a say in how the world works is 

2437
01:45:44,221 --> 01:45:46,300
ridiculous.
It's just too many dummies out there and

2438
01:45:46,301 --> 01:45:48,070
there's no way to stop that.
You know,

2439
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:50,400
we,
we have kind of bypassed nature and it's

2440
01:45:50,401 --> 01:45:55,401
strong.
It's not only the strong survive 

2441
01:45:55,401 --> 01:45:55,401
anymore,
it's everybody survives.

2442
01:45:55,401 --> 01:45:55,570
You know,
it's like,

2443
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,760
no matter what,
we try to keep you going,

2444
01:45:58,180 --> 01:46:03,180
you know,
he can be the dumbest motherfucker ever 

2445
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:03,180
and we try to keep it going.
That,

2446
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:05,830
that didn't always used to be the case 
and I think because it is the case,

2447
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,860
you know,
it's just,

2448
01:46:07,861 --> 01:46:12,861
just way too many dummies.
The irregular democracy just wasn't 

2449
01:46:12,861 --> 01:46:16,301
going to work.
I think that's one of the reasons why 

2450
01:46:16,301 --> 01:46:18,991
the government is completely full of 
shit and why there's just such a cash 

2451
01:46:18,991 --> 01:46:21,451
grab at the top and why you know,
why they still push war and why they 

2452
01:46:21,451 --> 01:46:21,451
still.
Because they know,

2453
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:26,520
they know that there's no way.
There's no way this fucking system is 

2454
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:27,280
supposed to be working.
You can't.

2455
01:46:27,281 --> 01:46:30,490
You can't have a regular real democracy.
People are too dumb.

2456
01:46:30,970 --> 01:46:34,350
You know the Sarah Palin thing proves 
all that and know,

2457
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:35,700
look how many people are into that 
check.

2458
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:41,220
That's amazing.
You would think that in a society in 

2459
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:44,050
2010 that someone who literally doesn't 
read at all,

2460
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,580
like you find out about that and you'd 
be like,

2461
01:46:45,581 --> 01:46:48,220
get that crazy bitch outta here.
Like she can't be president,

2462
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:49,860
but no,
people love it.

2463
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:50,970
They love her more than ever.

2464
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,480
What?
I agree,

2465
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:59,890
I've hit the wall like starting to go 
across.

2466
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,480
I do.
You need to take vitamins.

2467
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:07,120
That's a lot of times,
you know,

2468
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:10,250
but you can't just say that we're not 
even going to hit the two hour mark.

2469
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,720
These people are listening to us and 
their board now.

2470
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:13,990
Huh?
Should be,

2471
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:15,500
are listening.
People download this shit on.

2472
01:47:15,501 --> 01:47:16,100
I approximately.

2473
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:23,300
We're the longest podcast in those 
history of the Internet.

2474
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:26,090
You know that stuff is true.
No.

2475
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:29,960
Go look and buddy must've had a longer 
with her.

2476
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:32,780
That's ridiculous.
However you being silly.

2477
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:37,790
So probably just ain't never no pants on
guy talking about nine slash 11.

2478
01:47:37,791 --> 01:47:40,390
It's podcast is nine hours long.
Does it every day.

2479
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:46,540
We will not be suppressed.
Lisa interview with Alex Jones on 

2480
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:47,240
something the other day.
CNN.

2481
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:47,570
Yeah.

2482
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:48,860
Yeah.
What was it like?

2483
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:54,100
Somebody said it right that 98 percent 
of the time.

2484
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:55,370
Ninety nine percent.
Right?

2485
01:47:55,880 --> 01:48:00,360
Right.
Well that's a really.

2486
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:06,320
I don't know.
I might have paraphrased and made it 

2487
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:06,320
much better.
I'm going to use that no doubt.

2488
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:10,540
But that's,
I think that's really what it is at a 

2489
01:48:10,540 --> 01:48:10,540
certain point in time.
You know,

2490
01:48:10,540 --> 01:48:14,081
you got to listen to some of that shit 
that he says he's right about a lot of 

2491
01:48:14,081 --> 01:48:14,081
shit.
He's just so crazy.

2492
01:48:14,081 --> 01:48:15,140
It's hard to take them seriously.
You know,

2493
01:48:15,141 --> 01:48:17,720
everybody's like,
is Alex Joseph Disinformation agent?

2494
01:48:18,170 --> 01:48:20,090
I hope not because I think he's my 
friend.

2495
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:25,390
If it turns out it's just a district 
information age and he's been fucking 

2496
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:25,390
with me the whole time.
That's ridiculous.

2497
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:27,050
She had definitely been friends with me 
instead of the government.

2498
01:48:27,051 --> 01:48:28,700
You'd dummy.
That's the case.

2499
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:31,130
I'm way more fun to hang out with them.
The government,

2500
01:48:31,550 --> 01:48:36,550
you know,
if you've got to make money off the 

2501
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:36,550
government,
he doesn't need it.

2502
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:36,950
He's an entertaining you.
He's an entertaining speaker.

2503
01:48:36,951 --> 01:48:41,951
I enjoy listening to him talk.
He gets fucking crazy about shit and 

2504
01:48:41,951 --> 01:48:42,740
some of his videos are pretty goddamn 
jam up.

2505
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:45,260
Some of his videos are pretty.
God damn good.

2506
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:49,010
Have you ever watched nine slash 11?
The road to conspiracy or the.

2507
01:48:49,030 --> 01:48:50,990
The road to a fuck.
It was a called.

2508
01:48:51,010 --> 01:48:56,010
I've watched him conspiracies,
which should be called have watched it 

2509
01:48:56,010 --> 01:48:56,010
to me,
but you know,

2510
01:48:56,010 --> 01:48:58,570
there's a point,
there comes to a point you can't believe

2511
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:01,440
anybody because you weren't there and 
you can believe this side is that.

2512
01:49:01,570 --> 01:49:02,470
So to me,
I just become,

2513
01:49:02,471 --> 01:49:03,720
you know,
what avoids each other.

2514
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:05,620
I don't give a fuck.
What am I concerned?

2515
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:06,170
Even

2516
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:11,210
the nine slash 11 stuff.
It was the stuff in the World Trade 

2517
01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:11,440
Organization.
It was a stuff on these people that were

2518
01:49:11,441 --> 01:49:16,441
paid to disrupt peaceful protests.
They would hire cops to go in and dress 

2519
01:49:16,441 --> 01:49:19,090
up as a people with ski masks on and 
start smashing cars and shit,

2520
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:24,480
you know,
and he documents it all in and really 

2521
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:27,240
fucking exposes the shit out of it.
And apparently it's a common tactic and 

2522
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:27,240
that's why,
you know,

2523
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:31,921
whenever there's a demonstration 
anywhere that's ever anything important 

2524
01:49:31,921 --> 01:49:35,641
ever with involving world leaders and 
they're always the violence in these 

2525
01:49:35,641 --> 01:49:39,901
demonstrations.
Even if the people that are into this 

2526
01:49:39,901 --> 01:49:39,901
idea or completely nonviolent,
you know,

2527
01:49:39,901 --> 01:49:41,330
even if it's Buddhists,
you know,

2528
01:49:41,331 --> 01:49:42,670
against,
uh,

2529
01:49:42,671 --> 01:49:43,630
you know,
uh,

2530
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:45,070
something that,
you know,

2531
01:49:45,071 --> 01:49:50,071
that's happening in China and they all 
Buddhist show up and protest real 

2532
01:49:50,071 --> 01:49:54,421
Buddhists still,
someone will be smashing windows and 

2533
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:54,421
some shit will happen.

2534
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:58,200
Will they have to bring in cops.
And the reason why is because they do 

2535
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:01,201
that.
They do that to make a nonviolent 

2536
01:50:01,201 --> 01:50:01,780
protest,
a violent one so they can break it up.

2537
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:03,670
I mean,
that's real shit.

2538
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:05,410
The government's been doing that 
forever.

2539
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:10,590
That is so fucking corrupt,
so wrong on so many levels.

2540
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:16,320
And yet you never even hear about it.
And then they throw people in jail left 

2541
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:19,291
and right for not paying the taxes.
When was the last time anybody got 

2542
01:50:19,291 --> 01:50:20,020
thrown in jail for being a provocateur?
You know,

2543
01:50:20,021 --> 01:50:22,550
what was the last time he got got thrown
in jail for being a,

2544
01:50:22,551 --> 01:50:24,160
you know,
a professional anarchist,

2545
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:29,360
you know,
for being someone who gets hired to go 

2546
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:29,360
up and cause chaos and,
and create,

2547
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,640
uh,
create drama so they can have an excuse.

2548
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:33,790
That shit should be led.
That's like fucking treason.

2549
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:34,930
That really is.

2550
01:50:34,930 --> 01:50:36,640
That's like,
that's like slavery,

2551
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:41,970
like you're,
you are faking shit and fucking shit up 

2552
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:42,880
and people are going to get locked in a 
cage because of you,

2553
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:48,120
because of what you did.
You've taken away their freedom even 

2554
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:48,120
temporarily.
Some of them are actually going to go to

2555
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:52,111
jail for long periods of time because 
you're going to create trumped up 

2556
01:50:52,111 --> 01:50:53,090
charges of violence on them because 
there's some shit that you guys cost.

2557
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:54,730
That's.
That's tyranny.

2558
01:50:54,731 --> 01:50:57,190
That's.
That really is treason.

2559
01:50:57,370 --> 01:51:02,370
That's,
that's a person who should not be 

2560
01:51:02,370 --> 01:51:02,370
allowed to be an American.
You know you are.

2561
01:51:02,370 --> 01:51:05,461
You are corrupting everything.
That's great about what America is 

2562
01:51:05,461 --> 01:51:06,460
supposed to stand for you fucking cunts.
Right?

2563
01:51:07,930 --> 01:51:09,040
He's done.
Done.

2564
01:51:09,041 --> 01:51:14,041
Folks.
I'm going to answer a couple more 

2565
01:51:14,041 --> 01:51:14,041
questions because we can't end like 
this.

2566
01:51:14,041 --> 01:51:15,640
Fucking low blood sugar faggot.
I'm going to get them a plum.

2567
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:18,540
I probably am low blood sugar.
I know you're low blood sugar.

2568
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:21,790
You got an issue,
so we need to get you some supplements.

2569
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:24,950
Do you?
Well,

2570
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:27,050
I have nothing anymore.
You don't understand.

2571
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:29,120
I didn't even have pots and pans 
anymore.

2572
01:51:29,150 --> 01:51:31,220
I reason I had a roommate move out the 
hand.

2573
01:51:31,570 --> 01:51:33,310
Your roommate took everything.
Everything.

2574
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:34,780
Was it all your stuff?

2575
01:51:35,130 --> 01:51:38,220
Well,
like most of the big stuff is mine,

2576
01:51:38,221 --> 01:51:40,320
but when you realize,
oh no,

2577
01:51:40,321 --> 01:51:42,120
pots and pans.
Oh no dish.

2578
01:51:42,121 --> 01:51:44,010
So.
Oh no toilet paper.

2579
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:49,040
Oh No.
Got To start from scratch and you don't 

2580
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:49,040
even know what you're missing now.
You know?

2581
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:49,650
It's crazy.

2582
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:52,170
Wow.
Very crazy.

2583
01:51:52,590 --> 01:51:53,850
Yeah.
That's always a weird thing,

2584
01:51:53,851 --> 01:51:58,851
man.
When you live with somebody for three 

2585
01:51:58,851 --> 01:51:58,851
years and then you break up and then 
they move out and you're like,

2586
01:51:58,851 --> 01:51:59,430
wow,
now what?

2587
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:03,720
Fucking out what gets strange.
You know,

2588
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:08,520
if it gets really weird how you become 
so comfortable with living with somebody

2589
01:52:08,521 --> 01:52:10,170
new,
with not only that,

2590
01:52:10,171 --> 01:52:13,650
you get so accustomed to having that 
personal time we addict to each other.

2591
01:52:14,370 --> 01:52:17,130
That's why people get so terrified when 
people want to break up.

2592
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:17,770
Right.
You know,

2593
01:52:17,850 --> 01:52:19,070
people get terrified.
They're like,

2594
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:22,680
I'm addicted to you in my life will be 
hell if you leave,

2595
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:27,740
you know?
And that's really what it's like 

2596
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:27,740
sometimes.
You know,

2597
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:29,790
sometimes people obsess on relationships
for long periods of time,

2598
01:52:29,791 --> 01:52:34,770
but God so,
so much more often when the relationship

2599
01:52:34,771 --> 01:52:39,771
is over,
you feel so much better once it levels 

2600
01:52:39,771 --> 01:52:41,991
out like what I want to,
I want to fucking go canoeing and then 

2601
01:52:41,991 --> 01:52:46,011
maybe roller rollerskating or something 
where you were involved in a situation 

2602
01:52:46,011 --> 01:52:46,011
where,
I mean,

2603
01:52:46,011 --> 01:52:46,040
I don't know how much you want

2604
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:51,040
to talk about it,
but you were involved in a situation 

2605
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,871
where you felt like you were the person 
who wasn't very happy and you're a 

2606
01:52:52,941 --> 01:52:55,850
pretty easy going kind of silly guy.
It's also,

2607
01:52:55,851 --> 01:53:00,851
there's a problem too and having um,
a relationship with someone sometimes 

2608
01:53:00,851 --> 01:53:02,810
he's really struggling and you're not 
like,

2609
01:53:02,811 --> 01:53:07,811
you know,
you don't have to get up at a specific 

2610
01:53:07,811 --> 01:53:07,811
time every day.

2611
01:53:07,811 --> 01:53:10,230
That's,
that seems like a for crime with my 

2612
01:53:10,230 --> 01:53:10,230
whole life now because now you,
you,

2613
01:53:10,230 --> 01:53:12,930
most people have nine to five jobs and 
it's really hard to,

2614
01:53:12,990 --> 01:53:14,430
to think that like,
oh,

2615
01:53:14,431 --> 01:53:15,150
this person doesn't

2616
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:18,270
five that you enjoy is not that bad.
You know,

2617
01:53:18,271 --> 01:53:20,590
those people are usually fairly fun,
right.

2618
01:53:20,610 --> 01:53:22,200
You know,
or at least fairly happy.

2619
01:53:22,201 --> 01:53:24,060
But in nine to five that you hate,
that's hard,

2620
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:26,240
that's hard saucepan.
That's hard to us to solve.

2621
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:28,440
It gets to a point where,
um,

2622
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:33,470
you know,
like too much of a percentage of your 

2623
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:34,590
day is,
is pushed into the negative zone and you

2624
01:53:34,591 --> 01:53:37,230
start dragging that negativity.
It's not,

2625
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:42,250
you can just shut it off at the end of 
the day and all of a sudden be super 

2626
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:44,931
positive.
Like you're kind of beaten down by a 

2627
01:53:44,931 --> 01:53:47,480
boring ass day.
At the end of the week you get this 

2628
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:47,480
paycheck and it's like $300 and you're 
like,

2629
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:48,750
what?
$300.

2630
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:50,700
And they take the taxes out and that's 
what you've got left.

2631
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:55,260
You gave us your whole week and we give 
you $300 and you don't like it,

2632
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:57,300
you know,
and you're uncomfortable physically.

2633
01:53:57,390 --> 01:54:02,390
You know,
it's like there's so many issues that 

2634
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:02,390
people have to go through.
It's fucking hard,

2635
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:07,341
man.
But I don't think there's any other 

2636
01:54:07,341 --> 01:54:07,341
solution,
you know,

2637
01:54:07,341 --> 01:54:07,341
I mean,
this,

2638
01:54:07,341 --> 01:54:11,720
everyone can't really figure it out and 
find some job that they truly love.

2639
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:16,320
There's gonna be people that are in jobs
they don't like because if they're not,

2640
01:54:16,590 --> 01:54:17,750
there's,
there's,

2641
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:21,050
I mean we need to keep this fucking 
society rolling in,

2642
01:54:21,270 --> 01:54:22,950
you know,
and there's a lot of shit that you don't

2643
01:54:22,951 --> 01:54:23,740
want to do,
right?

2644
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:25,350
There's a lot of shit that I don't want 
to do.

2645
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:27,720
It's going to have to get done and if we
want to have a society like this,

2646
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:33,480
unless we develop robots.
I mean is that the future where robots 

2647
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:34,140
do all the jobs that suck and then the 
only people that are left are,

2648
01:54:34,141 --> 01:54:37,710
what were the creators,
the people who create things like what,

2649
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:40,020
what the fuck becomes a bit craftsman,
artists,

2650
01:54:40,021 --> 01:54:42,000
creatives,
doctors,

2651
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:43,980
engineers,
scientists,

2652
01:54:43,981 --> 01:54:46,860
people that create new computers and fix
the stuff that we have.

2653
01:54:46,861 --> 01:54:48,780
Technicians.
And then what else?

2654
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:51,210
Then you don't need burger king workers 
anymore.

2655
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:56,240
You know,
I mean this is going to get to a point 

2656
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:56,240
where that's going to be the case.
You know,

2657
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:59,480
you,
you don't need anybody to do anything 

2658
01:54:59,480 --> 01:54:59,480
that sucks.

2659
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:03,200
What's the deal with the longest census 
survey that they're making you fill out?

2660
01:55:03,670 --> 01:55:04,830
Make you fill it out?
Yeah.

2661
01:55:05,950 --> 01:55:10,950
It says it's the law or is it like like 
not doing your taxes kind of law or know

2662
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:11,910
man,

2663
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:14,240
until they can count Mexicans.
They could suck my dick.

2664
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:17,270
You don't know how many people are here.
You're not going to tell me that through

2665
01:55:17,271 --> 01:55:18,950
your little pieces of paper.
You got it all figured out.

2666
01:55:18,951 --> 01:55:23,951
That's nonsense.
There's so many Mexicans here that have 

2667
01:55:23,951 --> 01:55:24,080
snuck across the border and until you 
can count them,

2668
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:26,270
why are we playing games while we're 
pretending that you know?

2669
01:55:26,271 --> 01:55:26,300
Yeah,

2670
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:28,460
so I can wipe my ass with the census.
Shit.

2671
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:30,680
I just think it's silly.
You given me permission.

2672
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:33,800
I'm not telling you what to do.
You're a grown ass man.

2673
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:36,190
You're a grown ass man.
You gotta do what you want to do.

2674
01:55:36,230 --> 01:55:37,790
I keep on looking at it.
I'm like,

2675
01:55:37,850 --> 01:55:38,740
Oh,
why?

2676
01:55:39,130 --> 01:55:44,130
Why do I have to?
I don't feel like I need to do it and I 

2677
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:46,940
also,
I don't feel like I to participate in 

2678
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:46,940
anything

2679
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:46,940
extracurricular.
You know?

2680
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:47,940
I mean you gotta come up with a better 
way to count people.

2681
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:48,800
You know?
I don't know.

2682
01:55:48,850 --> 01:55:53,850
I don't,
I don't want to be a part of it since 

2683
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:54,000
and I don't think it's helping things.
I think until you start concentrating on

2684
01:55:54,001 --> 01:55:58,020
why the fuck are we in Iraq and in 
Afghanistan until we address that,

2685
01:55:58,050 --> 01:55:59,700
I'm not going to address how many people
there are.

2686
01:55:59,790 --> 01:56:00,350
Stop it

2687
01:56:00,690 --> 01:56:02,310
stupid.
Stop Embarrassing Yourself.

2688
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:04,920
Stop Embarrassing Yourself.
Get fucking government.

2689
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:07,110
You're learning everything you've 
cocksuckers.

2690
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:13,060
Alright,
a couple more questions then we'll just 

2691
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:13,060
get the fuck out of here ladies and 
gentlemen,

2692
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:13,830
because this has been almost two hours 
as of right now.

2693
01:56:15,070 --> 01:56:20,070
Um,
there's a lot of weird questions here.

2694
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:21,470
You strange motherfuckers.

2695
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:26,120
Impossible to try to keep up with the 
feed on the uh,

2696
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:31,210
the youth stream.
You bitches her very prolific but I'll 

2697
01:56:31,210 --> 01:56:32,300
check out twitter real quick.

2698
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:34,360
Do,
do,

2699
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:40,630
how do we pick the questions?
Topics for Ustream?

2700
01:56:41,030 --> 01:56:42,360
Um,
we just started talking

2701
01:56:43,490 --> 01:56:46,160
unfortunately.
Just pick it a little bit better.

2702
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:51,490
We'll just start talking.
I mean we've always got something that I

2703
01:56:51,570 --> 01:56:53,960
pretty much just came over here and we 
did coffee.

2704
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:55,570
We smoked a little.

2705
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:57,570
Then we started the party.
Yeah,

2706
01:56:57,700 --> 01:56:59,410
he came over here.
I was eating lunch.

2707
01:57:00,010 --> 01:57:01,270
He got in the door,
I said,

2708
01:57:01,271 --> 01:57:02,080
he wants a coffee.
He said,

2709
01:57:02,081 --> 01:57:03,700
yeah,
we brewed some coffee,

2710
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:06,370
fired up a bomb or a a pipe.

2711
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:08,800
That's pretty much it and that's it.
That's it.

2712
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:10,200
That was our,
that was our setup

2713
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:13,950
and if we had like a real producer,
we can take the ship worldwide.

2714
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:17,070
I'm going to do a weekly Sirius show.
They're just trying to figure out when's

2715
01:57:17,071 --> 01:57:20,760
the best time for me to do it and it'll 
be like one day a week for six weeks.

2716
01:57:20,761 --> 01:57:25,761
I'm going to do it.
It'll be on probably on raw dog and if 

2717
01:57:25,761 --> 01:57:28,821
it goes well and if they like it,
I'll consider doing it every week and 

2718
01:57:28,821 --> 01:57:30,660
keep doing that.
I just want to do more shit like this.

2719
01:57:30,690 --> 01:57:35,690
My only thing I'm going to say to them 
is I just want to be able to put it out 

2720
01:57:35,690 --> 01:57:35,690
as a podcast as well.
And if that's possible then I will do it

2721
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:38,280
for real money.
Yeah.

2722
01:57:38,281 --> 01:57:40,110
And well this is a real podcast too.
I mean,

2723
01:57:40,111 --> 01:57:45,111
people,
I get all these emails from people 

2724
01:57:45,111 --> 01:57:45,111
selling me,
they listen to the subway and that they,

2725
01:57:45,111 --> 01:57:45,111
you know,
they listened while they're at work.

2726
01:57:45,111 --> 01:57:45,750
And thank you very much.

2727
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:50,570
This is from a web cam show.
This is just the raw audio.

2728
01:57:50,571 --> 01:57:53,790
This is so we've done no engineering but
engineering,

2729
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:57,000
I think that's important.
I think what's important is the things I

2730
01:57:57,001 --> 01:58:02,001
like most when I listened to like opie 
and anthony or bubble loves bonds or 

2731
01:58:02,001 --> 01:58:05,091
anything like that.
It's like when they're in the middle of 

2732
01:58:05,091 --> 01:58:06,621
a conversation and it's an interesting 
conversation and I enjoy the point of 

2733
01:58:06,621 --> 01:58:10,371
views and the arguments and 
disagreements and the revelations of 

2734
01:58:10,371 --> 01:58:11,040
these guys have.
I like shows like that.

2735
01:58:11,041 --> 01:58:16,041
That's what I want to hear.
I don't really care if it's produced 

2736
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:16,041
well,
that's all nonsense to me.

2737
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:16,710
I just want to,
I just want to listen to people,

2738
01:58:16,711 --> 01:58:21,711
be honest and I want to see if I think 
the way they think or if I can learn 

2739
01:58:21,711 --> 01:58:22,560
something from the way they think,
you know,

2740
01:58:22,561 --> 01:58:23,910
and uh,
I'm going to try to do that.

2741
01:58:23,911 --> 01:58:28,200
So when they do that and uh,
I'm right about to do a deal to a,

2742
01:58:28,230 --> 01:58:33,230
it's not been totally finalized but 
almost real close where I'm going to 

2743
01:58:33,230 --> 01:58:33,230
write a book.

2744
01:58:33,230 --> 01:58:33,230
So,
uh,

2745
01:58:33,230 --> 01:58:36,180
I'm in the middle of doing that too.
I'm gonna get that shit crack.

2746
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:41,200
I've been writing for a while but now 
it's like the deals I've actually 

2747
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:41,740
finalized and I have it.
It's a form,

2748
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:46,860
so it's gonna be difficult and I'm going
to try to update my website with more,

2749
01:58:46,901 --> 01:58:51,901
like little quick videos and shit 
because it'd be harder to just keep 

2750
01:58:51,901 --> 01:58:51,901
writing things over and over and over 
again.

2751
01:58:52,330 --> 01:58:54,060
Um,
so the next show I've got is,

2752
01:58:54,061 --> 01:58:56,350
uh,
this weekend I'm doing the Kevin Beans,

2753
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:57,250
Kevin and beans,
uh,

2754
01:58:57,251 --> 01:59:01,690
April foolishness at the universal,
a universal amphitheatre or some shit.

2755
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:04,210
So what it is,
did it last year was awesome.

2756
01:59:04,211 --> 01:59:05,650
Those guys are great.
They're awesome.

2757
01:59:05,770 --> 01:59:10,230
There's a lot of funny comics on,
but I believe the shit sold out song and

2758
01:59:10,270 --> 01:59:12,200
I'm headlining at.
So um,

2759
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:18,120
which is always interesting.
People get tired and also there's a lot 

2760
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:20,170
of topics or to get covered off to bring
up a price change topics.

2761
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:21,610
So,
um,

2762
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:23,910
that's it for this week's podcast.
I'm.

2763
01:59:24,130 --> 01:59:29,130
Thank you very much.
All the people came to see me in New 

2764
01:59:29,130 --> 01:59:29,130
York last week.
I had a fucking hell of a time.

2765
01:59:29,130 --> 01:59:29,920
Thank you very much.
I was those.

2766
01:59:29,970 --> 01:59:34,970
I was so happy.
I haven't been back to New York in two 

2767
01:59:34,970 --> 01:59:34,970
years.
I switched it up,

2768
01:59:34,970 --> 01:59:36,700
went to Gotham this time.
It usually do qa caroline's,

2769
01:59:36,701 --> 01:59:38,920
but I did Gotham and Gotham was fucking 
awesome.

2770
01:59:38,921 --> 01:59:40,450
I love that.
I had a great time there.

2771
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:42,850
I love this.
I got a big ass stage.

2772
01:59:42,970 --> 01:59:44,620
The crowd was great.
It was.

2773
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:47,250
The staff was great.
And then I did um,

2774
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:51,100
a Amos says south end in South Carolina 
and North Carolina Rather.

2775
01:59:51,130 --> 01:59:53,260
And had a great fucking time there in 
Charlotte.

2776
01:59:53,290 --> 01:59:58,290
That was awesome too.
So thank you everybody that came out to 

2777
01:59:58,290 --> 01:59:58,780
the in New York shows and thank you to 
everybody came up to the Charlotte show.

2778
01:59:59,110 --> 02:00:00,190
And uh,
that's it.

2779
02:00:00,330 --> 02:00:01,660
This is a,
the annual.

2780
02:00:01,661 --> 02:00:04,780
We're going to do another one of these 
probably more like Tuesday because I got

2781
02:00:04,781 --> 02:00:09,781
to go to Abu Dhabi next week,
fly a plane in the middle two all the 

2782
02:00:13,511 --> 02:00:18,511
way across the world to a strange land 
and for sure I'll have some interesting
