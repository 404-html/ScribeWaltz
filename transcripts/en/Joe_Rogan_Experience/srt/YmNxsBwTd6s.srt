1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,970
So we live in strange times.

3
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:03,804
Greg Proops.

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,531
It's amazing,

5
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:04,870
isn't it?

6
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,790
Exciting part is like I'm ready for
a lot of the old stuff to go away.

7
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,943
Yeah.

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,610
I think,

9
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,240
uh,

10
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,260
I mean I have tradition,

11
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:15,480
obviously I write with a
piece of paper and a pen.

12
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,471
Do you really?

13
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:17,100
Yeah.

14
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,710
I feel like I can't
write as fast that way,

15
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:21,450
so the ideas slip away from me,

16
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,550
but I do write it down before
I go on stage because when,

17
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,600
especially new stuff,

18
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,600
I feel like if I don't physically
write it down with a pen and a paper,

19
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:31,740
I don't remember it the same way.

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,440
I,

21
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,870
that's exactly what I was going to say,

22
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:34,320
Joe.

23
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,650
I've done a survey of every comic of
talked to him the last two or three years.

24
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,790
Every club I played,

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I make everybody get their
book out and show me how I go.

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,470
Where do you keep your
ideas and everybody?

27
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:44,940
Yeah.

28
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,100
Book a little book with your lists on it.

29
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,470
Mine minor on hotel rooms,

30
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,170
stationary.

31
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,003
Thousands of them,

32
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,400
thousands of pieces of
paper I write and I say,

33
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,390
why do you do it that way?

34
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,920
Do you ever write it on your phone?

35
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:56,450
Yeah.

36
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:56,700
Uh,

37
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,511
if I think of a one line,

38
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:58,110
then I ride it,

39
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:58,361
you know,

40
00:00:58,361 --> 00:00:58,950
did it today.

41
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,240
But do you write your Heloc to the phone?

42
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:01,074
No.

43
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,250
In the end I have to put it on a piece
of paper in red and I just think it's a

44
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,084
mental,

45
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,840
yeah,

46
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,580
that's the really old
fashioned part of performing.

47
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,900
I have a note lists of
set lists on my phone,

48
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:16,230
but I'll go to like right before I go on
stage sometimes if I want to make sure

49
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:18,000
that I remember some new
shit that I'm working on.

50
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,890
But when I write I go,

51
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,360
when are you going to that luck trance?

52
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,970
I can do that so much better
when I'm typing because I can,

53
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,141
the,

54
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:28,080
the words just appear like I
can type a word in a second,

55
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,160
whereas it takes,

56
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,340
but can you remember if you type no,

57
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,880
but I can write better so I get the
trance out and I can get more information

58
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:36,481
out as I'm writing.

59
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:38,040
But then I go back and I'm like,

60
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:38,591
fuck it.

61
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:38,821
Right.

62
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:39,960
That I remember writing that.

63
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:40,500
Like I'll,

64
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,630
I'll laugh at some of my
own shit and then I'll go,

65
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:42,931
okay,

66
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:43,211
I got it.

67
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:44,280
That I've got to keep that part.

68
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,310
Cause I don't even remember
writing because that'll
have five hours of writing.

69
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,600
How much do you actually remember?

70
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,980
But the act of actually
scribing it into a paper,

71
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,881
a piece of paper.

72
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,320
There's something about that that's like,

73
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,670
it just really like,

74
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,420
it just stores in your memory that's like,

75
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:00,160
it's like a,

76
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,760
we humans have been doing
it that way for so long.

77
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,743
It's like

78
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,510
it's been five,

79
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:06,901
seven,

80
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,880
10,000 years since people started writing.

81
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:09,090
Yeah.

82
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,780
I think it,

83
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,970
there's a real profound
connection with the paper.

84
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,230
Yeah.

85
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,940
Have you ever thought
about releasing those?

86
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,080
Like with your,

87
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:16,530
um,

88
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,760
like with a special,

89
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,340
like when you release a special
release your notes as well.

90
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,090
Wow.

91
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:21,271
No,

92
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:21,840
I haven't.

93
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,120
One time I did a fun
article for Filter magazine.

94
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,650
The guy came over to me and he said,

95
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:26,484
how do you,

96
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,920
he saw me fumbling with
my notes and I said,

97
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:30,450
it's all different pieces
of hotel stationary.

98
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,100
So I asked my wife to pick it and he goes,

99
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:33,210
well that will be the article.

100
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,730
Just I want a picture of these,

101
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,603
you know,

102
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,970
notes atlas.

103
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,990
And uh,

104
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,681
I said to my wife,

105
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,131
you pick it out.

106
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:42,690
I give her the folder full of shit.

107
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,490
So she picked out four random ones.

108
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:45,181
It was one from like,

109
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,440
Paris went from Minnesota,

110
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,160
one from one place.

111
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,170
I didn't remember being
terrible and somewhere,

112
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,511
you know,

113
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:54,420
and then there was another one
and then it just sad like Clinton,

114
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:55,930
you know,

115
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,590
uh,

116
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:56,821
you know,

117
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:57,421
corn,

118
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:58,680
whatever the fuck was on the list,

119
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,900
the Olsen twins and I kind of went
through the list as the article.

120
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:02,620
I just went like,

121
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,220
yeah,

122
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,870
I was doing Clinton jokes in Paris,

123
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,580
you know,

124
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:05,851
I,

125
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:06,710
well I think I slept.

126
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:06,910
Really,

127
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,040
it's always 92 when I rock the Mike Rock,

128
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,791
dumb luck or whatever,

129
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,061
you know,

130
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:10,894
like,

131
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,733
uh,

132
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,490
that there is a weird insight
into kind of like what's going on.

133
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:15,911
Exactly.

134
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:19,090
Then with all your setlist
cause the different notes
you make on them and stuff.

135
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,390
I don't know that there's a
that much to be garnered from,

136
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,621
I mean,

137
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,070
I could probably remember some
of the debts and stuff like that.

138
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,000
So just something that might be cool.

139
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,420
Like if I was a fan and I got it.

140
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:30,730
Yeah,

141
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:30,881
yeah,

142
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,091
yeah,

143
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:31,690
definitely.

144
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,523
Just see my old song,

145
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,600
I put it up on design or something.

146
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,850
If you just put the photos online.

147
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,713
Well you ever see that?

148
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,790
A website called letters of note?

149
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,660
No.

150
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,021
Uh,

151
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,860
and there's another one,

152
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,880
something of note.

153
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,900
Um,

154
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,830
but letters of notice letters
people wrote to each other or even,

155
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,100
oh,

156
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,930
I think there's one called lists of note.

157
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:50,980
And um,

158
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,950
the list of note is just different lists
that famous people wrote or anybody you

159
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:54,041
know,

160
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:54,390
notable.

161
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,170
Like the one I remember
is Thelonious monk,

162
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,380
cause I read it on my show at the monk,

163
00:03:59,410 --> 00:03:59,850
you know,

164
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,550
uh,

165
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,650
he had different mental
problems and stuff.

166
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:02,861
You know,

167
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:05,350
if you've ever seen him play like he
played and then he started to get up and

168
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:06,310
walk around the stage,

169
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,120
you know?

170
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,953
Yeah.

171
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,861
And he's extraordinary.

172
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:10,660
And then he was given drugs
and they didn't quite work out.

173
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,090
But anyway,

174
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:11,950
he's a genius.

175
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:16,230
And he could both compose and arrange
and extemporize and his band was,

176
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:16,530
you know,

177
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,363
of

178
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,050
putting the position of
having to deal with his,

179
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,460
his personality,

180
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:21,731
right?

181
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:21,881
Like,

182
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:23,650
cause he wasn't like a regular guy who,

183
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,070
who,

184
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,371
hey,

185
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:24,730
let's,

186
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:24,941
you know,

187
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:25,774
I'll be there at five,

188
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,111
you know,

189
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:29,650
he had to kind of be
pushed around to places,

190
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:33,760
but then when he could play was so he
wrote a note and on the net it's just how

191
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:34,451
do we address tonight,

192
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:35,530
sharp as possible.

193
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:36,130
Underlined.

194
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,780
Right.

195
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,150
And then,

196
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,360
uh,

197
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,631
if you're,

198
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:38,830
the drummer I think is something,

199
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,191
you know,

200
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:42,340
like there's all this
like really broken down,

201
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,110
like the thoughts you have
before you go on stage.

202
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,880
Like about the band and how he
wanted the band to play and look.

203
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,190
And I would,

204
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,470
I would read that out sometimes.

205
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,860
And so I would say on the show,

206
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,920
how do we adjust tonight?

207
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,110
Sharp is possible.

208
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,180
Oh yeah.

209
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,760
Right.

210
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,980
So there's lists of note
and there's letters of note.

211
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,570
And then at the last letter of note,

212
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,440
someone sent it to me,

213
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,550
uh,

214
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,821
was,

215
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:01,270
um,

216
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,270
Jackie Robinson went to a luncheon
or a dinner at Ike was speaking at,

217
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,060
right.

218
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,710
And Jackie was an executive.

219
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,460
Yeah.

220
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,680
Jackie Robinson was an
executive at chock full of nuts.

221
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:12,101
Coffee,

222
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:12,430
right?

223
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,880
Like he got a job in the corporate
world because he was an intelligent,

224
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,500
capable and famous person.

225
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,450
He became an executive,

226
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,930
a chocolate nuts in New York and
show he went to this like banquet and

227
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:28,990
Eisenhower Spec and it was a lot of black
people there who are in business and

228
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:29,591
Eisenhower said,

229
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:30,670
you've got to be patient,

230
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,853
right.

231
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,360
You'll chime will come and all that.

232
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,680
This is the city's.

233
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,250
Wow.

234
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,120
So Jackie wrote him a
very respectful letter,

235
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,780
but also very pointed about your patients.

236
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:44,614
You know,

237
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,000
and I'm not doing it any justice.

238
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,271
It was just,

239
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:46,481
you know,

240
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:46,651
Jim,

241
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:47,484
Mr President,

242
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,940
having recently attended the lunch,

243
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:51,790
or I have to say that on
behalf of myself and my race,

244
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,830
the time for patients is long pass.

245
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:56,860
You'll find that over the past
several hundred years we've endured,

246
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,580
but countless indignant,

247
00:05:58,581 --> 00:05:58,970
you know?

248
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,301
Right,

249
00:05:59,301 --> 00:05:59,600
right,

250
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,380
right.

251
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,920
And then the repository
is the next letter.

252
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,630
Eisenhower wrote him back,

253
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,340
do you Mr. Robinson,

254
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,240
thank you for your letter as I take on
board what you said and I profoundly,

255
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:11,481
you know,

256
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,310
Blah Blah Blah.

257
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:12,590
I'm like,

258
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,130
Oh wow,

259
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,510
this exchange in a very civil
and high faluting language,

260
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,010
not the language that we use now,

261
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,590
but like formal letter writing language,

262
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,251
uh,

263
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:26,030
with the idea of very explicitly expressed
that he no longer had the patients to

264
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:26,240
wait,

265
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,950
that he felt that why shitty weight.

266
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,310
Right.

267
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,170
And why should you have to go
to a dinner with the president,

268
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:33,440
told him to wait when even the first
fucking black guy in the big leagues and

269
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:36,170
they get a job and fucking
business and you know,

270
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:37,550
trying to run his life and shit.

271
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:37,880
Right.

272
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,980
Yeah.

273
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,730
And Eisenhower like,

274
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:41,331
he will,

275
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:42,164
you know,

276
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,860
one day schools will be integrated and
you want to have to drink it another

277
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:47,060
faucet and you know,

278
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,470
you don't want to hear that.

279
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,920
And so those kinds of letters I
think to me are like fascinating.

280
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:52,381
Yeah.

281
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:54,380
So letters you've known
enlisted node are quite good.

282
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,220
If you want to just,

283
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,630
you mean you don't have
to read everything on it,

284
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:56,990
but it's,

285
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,010
it's different letters to people
and to that's fucking bad ass.

286
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,620
Yeah.

287
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,210
I will check that nobody
writes letters anymore.

288
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:02,430
In,

289
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,430
in future it will be your setlist of note
and your emails of note and your blog

290
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:09,380
of note the probably be a letter.

291
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:09,921
Yeah,

292
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:10,754
it's going away.

293
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,620
The physical act of writing is going away.

294
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:16,490
If I didn't have to write my set lists
down or occasional like fill out a form,

295
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,990
like when I go to Canada
or something like that,

296
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,680
I wouldn't,

297
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,940
I don't really write anything.

298
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,283
I do.

299
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:21,511
I mean,

300
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:22,344
I read it,

301
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,623
I write on my computer,

302
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,370
but I write in a book
too because it's fun.

303
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,500
You're a fucking human being.
