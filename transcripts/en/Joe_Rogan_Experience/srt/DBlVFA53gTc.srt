00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,090
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,331
Yeah,

3
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:04,200
I know a lot of cops,

4
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:04,950
man,

5
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,231
they,

6
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:06,030
they see the,

7
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,430
one of the problems is you're a cop.

8
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,490
You see a lot of shit.

9
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,190
I see a lot of shit all the
time and you lose your patience.

10
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:11,881
You lose,

11
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:13,140
you lose your patients and you,

12
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:13,411
you know,

13
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:13,681
you,

14
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:13,981
you,

15
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:14,340
you,

16
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,070
you become more attuned to the kinds of
the world then you would like to be and

17
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,060
you don't want to hear any
fucking bullshit anymore.

18
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,990
So very,

19
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,550
very fucking tricky job.

20
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:23,641
My,

21
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:24,180
my pain.

22
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:24,900
Your humanity.

23
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,740
My question is this,

24
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:29,970
now you're always seeing the worst in
people being did I know that there are

25
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:32,100
people out there who
really do risk their lives.

26
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,560
Like if someone's house
is getting robbed or,

27
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:34,741
well,

28
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:35,560
how about this guy?

29
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,151
The fucking,

30
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:37,050
this guy in Denver,

31
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:37,321
man,

32
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:37,681
they had it.

33
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:39,000
Someone had to go in there and stop him.

34
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,541
You know,

35
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:39,990
this isn't,

36
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,160
this isn't something that you,

37
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:41,581
you know,

38
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:44,940
the community can just rally together.

39
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,960
No one had guns.

40
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,710
But my question is the,

41
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,620
the police that break the law,

42
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,740
should they be held more
accountable because they know
the law that much better?

43
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,341
Like in other words,

44
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:59,250
if you had killed somebody to
ever or should you get time

45
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,591
minimize?

46
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:02,041
For example,

47
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,020
there's a case in in New York where a guy,

48
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,430
he got like a a year of probation or
something or was it a year in one year in

49
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:12,660
jail is because he killed a guy
while he was drunk driving and he's,

50
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:16,390
he's his family is apparently
connected with the NYP ds.

51
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,240
This is my question though.

52
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,250
If if you're a caption should be held
accountable to the law even more so

53
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,650
because you knew it was wrong
to be drunk and driving.

54
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,120
You arrested people probably a hundred
times for doing the same thing.

55
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,520
You don't think that it's ever been
shown that to put people in a situation

56
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:36,510
where it's whatever they're doing
that's wrong has more of a consequence.

57
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:38,100
I don't think that's
ever been shown to them.

58
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:39,570
It have any effect on their actions.

59
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,300
I think people do shit cause they think
they're going to get away with it.

60
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,030
They don't do shit because they
measure the consequences and go,

61
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,750
all right,

62
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,100
I might do a year in jail.

63
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,731
Fuck it,

64
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:48,450
let's ride.

65
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,840
They don't do it like that there.

66
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,331
It's,

67
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:52,740
it's more of an impulsive
sort of a thing when,

68
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,120
when people make mistakes,

69
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,991
but if people know,

70
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:55,824
listen,

71
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,550
there's no way that I'm really going to
catch it that much heat for this because

72
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,980
who the fuck is,

73
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:01,560
right?

74
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,880
If I'm drunk and somebody pulls me over
and we both play for the same team,

75
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,110
you're going to bring me in.

76
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,670
Do you know what's going to
happen in you after that?

77
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,800
What's really crazy is how many cops
turned out to be corrupt back in the days

78
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:14,634
before the Internet.

79
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:14,791
I mean,

80
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,100
I think it's very difficult
to be corrupt today,

81
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,970
but I think back in the day it
was probably pretty fucking easy.

82
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:21,760
I miss,

83
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,270
I think it's slightly less
difficult to be corrupt.

84
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:24,481
I mean,

85
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:25,980
I think you can if,

86
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,810
if there's money in it for you,

87
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,171
you know,

88
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:29,820
and I think there's levels of corruption,

89
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,020
there's harmful levels,

90
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,460
and then there's simple stuff like,

91
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:33,294
you know what?

92
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,261
I'll fix it.

93
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:34,980
Tickets for you.

94
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,251
You know,

95
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:36,084
we're good friends.

96
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,201
That's corruption.

97
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:38,310
Whether or not it's,

98
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,160
it's bad.

99
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,991
Those kids are dying.

100
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:42,050
Someone shouldn't have the
ability to do that and they say,

101
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,720
you know what,

102
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,830
you're connected with me.

103
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,990
I'll give you the card
when you have a problem,

104
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,730
you call me and I'd take care of it.

105
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,890
I know people that benefit from that.

106
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:54,420
I know people that had been in situations
where they may not be 100% right and

107
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:59,421
they have a specific card or something
like that and I'm not denigrating thing.

108
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,990
I'm just saying that at some point,

109
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:02,740
you know,

110
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,820
are you more responsible
for your corruption because
you know the law 10 times

111
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,070
better and you're enforcing
it and forcing it.

112
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,641
In other words,

113
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:14,641
if you get caught for murder and then
you're off all of a sudden in five years,

114
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,610
that's only because you knew the law
better and then you still broke it.

115
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,220
Well,

116
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,560
he was selling drugs to pick.

117
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:20,981
I said,

118
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,360
I don't think that you can,

119
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,430
you make people more responsive
when you going to change.

120
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:24,911
Thank you.

121
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:27,250
Might make people feel better
because you're punishing them more,

122
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,640
but I don't think you're necessarily
going to change behavior by offering a

123
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,720
bigger consequence.

124
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,480
I think the only way to change
behaviors to change thinking,

125
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,590
and what I try to tell people
is it sounds ridiculous,

126
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:40,510
but this is something that
came to me on a boat once,

127
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,870
is that you got to treat everybody as
if it's you living in another life.

128
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,700
We could all do that.

129
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,110
We could all do that.

130
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:48,680
If we could all picture ev,

131
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,900
any person,

132
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,570
regardless of what the fuck
they're going through in your life,

133
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,130
think about what it would be like to live
that person's life from birth to death

134
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,630
with their situation,

135
00:03:58,631 --> 00:03:59,920
their economic situation,

136
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:01,720
their biological situation there,

137
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,950
their life experiences.

138
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,290
Would you be any different
than that person?

139
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,490
If you were that man,

140
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:07,510
if you were that woman,

141
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:09,040
would you be any different?

142
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:09,970
Are you them?

143
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,110
You know,

144
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,030
if that person was born you,

145
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:13,900
would they be you?

146
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,640
And Are we all the same like that?

147
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,640
And is that what life really is all about
is figuring out that each one of us is

148
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:21,610
exactly the same.

149
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:24,340
We're just living through at
different biological circumstance.

150
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,550
And the more you can
treat everyone you meet,

151
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,150
like there,

152
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,280
you living another life,

153
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,110
the happier you'll be.

154
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,490
And that's the only way we're ever going
to sort this thing out is everyone has

155
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:40,000
to do things based on
that ideal everyone had,

156
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:42,340
whether it's business or personal shit.

157
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,271
Whatever you do,

158
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:47,530
you always have to think that this person
that you're dealing with is you living

159
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:50,830
another life and you can't
let them boss you around.

160
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:52,060
Can't let them talk shit to you.

161
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,560
Can't let them fuck up your life.

162
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,140
You know you do your best
to keep them on track,

163
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:58,540
but your ethic and your resolve and your,

164
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:02,860
your intent should always be to treat
