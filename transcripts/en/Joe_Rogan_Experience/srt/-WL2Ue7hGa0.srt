1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,380
Bobby Kelly got us four,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,543
three,

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,473
two,

4
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,560
one.

5
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,850
Can you talk about that on there and no?

6
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,410
Yeah.

7
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:06,780
Yeah.

8
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,540
It doesn't say he got us his knives bed.

9
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,530
We weren't bushwhacking.

10
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,380
Oh.

11
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:10,820
Uh,

12
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,090
and he got this one guy was like,

13
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:13,410
I want to make you guys
not have suited me.

14
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:13,621
Joe.

15
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,454
Listen,

16
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,160
Robert Kelly like custom knives.

17
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,981
Knives,

18
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:17,150
Huh?

19
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,760
Yeah.

20
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,830
Machete type knife to chop up some wood.

21
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,783
Oh fuck it.

22
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,860
We're doing camping,

23
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,990
hiking and then hiking like
four hours to a campsite.

24
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,850
Really loves fly fishing.

25
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,360
Right.

26
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,620
Isn't he a big fly Fisher?

27
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,440
Yeah.

28
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,770
Yeah.

29
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,950
He maybe he likes doing shit that he,

30
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,420
his body shouldn't allow him to do.

31
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,963
Um,

32
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,860
it's crazy.

33
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,693
When you was skinny.

34
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,521
That's nuts.

35
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:39,140
I see that video,

36
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,901
that picture of him,

37
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,060
that headshot the comedy cellar.

38
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,311
I'm like,

39
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:42,420
that's that guy dude.

40
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:43,410
He was like my size.

41
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,120
He was like a normal sized person.

42
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,440
It's nuts to me.

43
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,633
It is nuts.

44
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,270
Yeah.

45
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,110
When I met him,

46
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,910
we were working together and he lived in,

47
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,600
um,

48
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,600
a home with a special needs kids and um,

49
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,940
he would like take care of them.

50
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:01,250
Oh,

51
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,830
that was,

52
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,311
he was,

53
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:02,620
uh,

54
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,360
like a,

55
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,680
like a counselor or some sort of a teacher
or something like with special needs

56
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,370
kids and um,

57
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,070
he was totally normal size.

58
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:11,640
Wow.

59
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,260
Like you would see him like,

60
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:13,830
uh,

61
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,000
let me compare him to somebody.

62
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,380
He's a fat fuck now.

63
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,830
I haven't seen him in a long time.

64
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:20,340
I mean I let me just trash him for
a minute about his big overweight.

65
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,290
I'm sad because I really liked that guy.

66
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,124
He's a sweetheart.

67
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,371
Yeah.

68
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:24,390
Well enjoy them while you can.

69
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,911
He has a kid too,

70
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,330
right?

71
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:27,541
Yeah.

72
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,020
As a kid.

73
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,321
Great.

74
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:28,800
Good.

75
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,950
Well why is he allowing himself
to eat himself to death?

76
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,281
Okay.

77
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:34,410
Well I think a little
bit in the addict's mind,

78
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:35,191
you don't really have it.

79
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:36,180
You're not really an addict.

80
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:36,690
You've got,

81
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,060
it's like the replacement thing is real.

82
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,740
You gotta replace one with the other.

83
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,300
What was his attic before?

84
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,350
We think coke and,

85
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,273
and um,

86
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,210
then booze.

87
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,111
Yeah,

88
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:46,741
that's a thing,

89
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:47,011
man.

90
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:47,910
That's a real thing.

91
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,260
That's it out every time.

92
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:52,620
He tries to get in shape and think does
a month and then like it just falls off

93
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:52,951
a day.

94
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:54,810
And then just keeps falling off.

95
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,460
He's fatter than ever now.

96
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:56,971
Yeah.

97
00:01:56,971 --> 00:02:00,630
I saw a photo from that cruise at
Burt went on with them and I was like,

98
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:01,560
Oh God.

99
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:01,891
Yeah.

100
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,660
They couldn't let him go anywhere
but the middle of the boat.

101
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,031
Otherwise,

102
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:04,864
who would like to,

103
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,641
that's crazy.

104
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:06,480
Sharks and shit,

105
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,760
which I feel like I'm this side,

106
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,520
this side,

107
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:09,900
Bobby,

108
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,070
we have a chance to eat all those.

109
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,091
Well,

110
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,970
you can't be on a boat with
those fucking buffets to man,

111
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,290
those buffets are brutal.

112
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,020
I gained 12 pounds in a week on
the joker's cruise last year.

113
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,680
I believe it.

114
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,460
Oh yeah.

115
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,840
Buffets or rough man.

116
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,330
Uh,

117
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:22,711
we,

118
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:23,430
uh,

119
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,810
last time I was in Vegas,

120
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,710
I ate that at the buffet
and they're great.

121
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,100
You just hate crepes.

122
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:29,821
All kinds of shit.

123
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:30,530
I should never eat.

124
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:30,660
Oh,

125
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,493
go for thirds.

126
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,360
A small portion,

127
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,060
fried chicken and waffles and
it's like your friends go,

128
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,871
your friends go,

129
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:37,150
uh,

130
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,531
you want to eat.

131
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:37,741
I'm like,

132
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:37,891
no,

133
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,790
I just say like four hours ago.

134
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,061
Like what?

135
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:39,561
Come sit with us.

136
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:39,960
We're like,

137
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,793
okay,

138
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,970
I saw some fries.

139
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,421
I'll go get it.

140
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,254
Some cupcakes,

141
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,760
some cupcakes.

142
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,390
How rich you get the free,

143
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:49,891
it's free.

144
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:51,840
You can just take whatever
you'd have to open your,

145
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:52,050
well,

146
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,640
it's such an easy process right there.

147
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,420
I could just grab it,

148
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:54,991
do the best.

149
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:59,410
Is these fucking Filipino and like these
immigrant type like employees that are

150
00:02:59,411 --> 00:02:59,740
clear,

151
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,491
are you guys done with this?

152
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:00,760
And like,

153
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,031
Oh yeah,

154
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:01,331
I'm done.

155
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:01,980
They're like,

156
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,813
are you kidding me?

157
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,110
This could feed my whole village,

158
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,220
which you're throwing away.

159
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,970
It's like keep that smile on their face.

160
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,200
When you find out the real statistics
of like how much people make in certain

161
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,010
countries,

162
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,920
you know like I was reading something
about how much people look at the average

163
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:19,930
salary of a person who lives in Thailand.

164
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,390
It's like a thousand dollars a month did.

165
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,560
I was on a bus from Indonesia to East
Timor to cross a land border and some guy

166
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,690
was talking about how much
people make and I told them,

167
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:30,900
it's like,

168
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,480
wait,

169
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,200
what?

170
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,760
I'm like have a cost of
living is way higher.

171
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:34,091
And he's like,

172
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:34,691
oh that's great.

173
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:35,700
I should have a $50 bill.

174
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,330
He was like lost his mind.

175
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:37,720
Wow.

176
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,140
How many,

177
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,280
how many Cha Cha,

178
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:39,870
I forgot how,

179
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,750
what their currency is,

180
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,771
how many is this worth?

181
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:42,251
And I told him,

182
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:42,600
he's like,

183
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,433
why?

184
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:45,820
Yeah,

185
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,650
I think I'm wrong to about
a thousand dollars a month.

186
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,600
They make those high.

187
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,950
It's possible.

188
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,970
It might be like one quarter of that.

189
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,400
A lot of them also don't
use currency that much.

190
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,110
They're like,

191
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,600
yeah,

192
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,433
we farm,

193
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,400
we trade with our neighbor milk.

194
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,690
I mean like we don't need currency.

195
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,820
Did we took these lessons on how to,

196
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,961
how to grow,

197
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:05,680
how to like,

198
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,513
uh,

199
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,410
take rice,

200
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,970
plant it and like they take you
through the whole steps in Thailand,

201
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,970
they give you the outfits
and everything needed.

202
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,020
All the people that farm rice where,

203
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,040
but you realize like before
industrialized agriculture,

204
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,590
what a process it was
to actually get rice.

205
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,270
Like fuck that.

206
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,800
It is a giant process.

207
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,960
It's crazy how much work is involved.

208
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,141
Yeah.

209
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,150
You see them up to their
fucking wasted water.

210
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,013
Yeah.

211
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,720
I saw a dead dog in a rice
patty wants to face down.

212
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,800
They're still serving that rise,

213
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,461
I'm sure.

214
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:39,671
Yeah.

215
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:40,810
They're not going to waste that rice.

216
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,860
Yeah.

217
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,730
Do you think they wash it
off at all or like maybe

218
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,730
you're going to put dead dog on it anyway.

219
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,010
Yeah.

220
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,670
All cause it's on cook console wrong.

221
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,510
Well the thing about the rices,

222
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,490
like I thought that at least when you
get the rice you'd just get the rice off

223
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:59,200
the plant and then you
could boil it and need it.

224
00:04:59,230 --> 00:04:59,530
No,

225
00:04:59,530 --> 00:04:59,890
no.

226
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,330
It's like a husk and you've got to beat
it down and break it open and then the

227
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:06,130
actual rice is underneath it.

228
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:06,850
Oh,

229
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,020
I'm just finding this about weed.

230
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,550
I thought you'd just
pick weed off a planet,

231
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,361
smoke it and like,

232
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:10,511
no,

233
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,580
you've got to curate and dry and cure it.

234
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,290
You know it's the worst
female weed is which one?

235
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:17,860
Right.

236
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,401
Oh right.

237
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,690
But male and female,

238
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:22,210
we'd get together and they,

239
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,880
if the mail we'd and the
female we'd get together,

240
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:25,930
it ruins the weed.

241
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,030
Like kind of like kind of like real life.

242
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,123
Kind of like real life.

243
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,450
Yeah,

244
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:29,681
man.

245
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:30,514
Ruined everything.

246
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,380
I didn't know that.

247
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:32,750
Uh,

248
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,390
that w that plants like,

249
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,740
I don't know Jack Shit about
horticulture or agriculture,

250
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:39,580
but they,

251
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,100
they breed like a male.

252
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:44,110
And a female version of these plants.

253
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:44,471
I was like,

254
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:45,304
what?

255
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,770
Like some guy was it grow?

256
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:49,720
It was trying to explain it to me like
how they isolate the female plants.

257
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:50,320
Like go wait a minute.

258
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,740
What?

259
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,730
Pete knows a lot about it.

260
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,331
Of course he does,

261
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:53,130
but like,

262
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:53,401
yeah,

263
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:55,180
it's like none of this makes sense.

264
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,340
What are you talking about?

265
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,220
Plant girl talking about plants you're on.

266
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,611
Yeah.

267
00:05:58,611 --> 00:05:58,791
No,

268
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,301
their plants.

269
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:01,800
They don't have a giant
as you fucking idiot.

270
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,630
Idiot.

271
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,141
Hey guys,

272
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:04,220
this thing I'd never researched.

273
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:07,010
I know way more about this guy who
lives in life and it looked into it.

274
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,630
I was stunned.

275
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,171
I was like,

276
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,900
there's a male version of female
version of a fucking plant.

277
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,080
What real dude?

278
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,450
I,

279
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,860
the more I've researched
plants because uh,

280
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,320
I had on this guy who's fascinating man.

281
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:22,154
You should really,

282
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,450
if you can get them on your podcast,

283
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:24,284
he,

284
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,213
Paul Stamets.

285
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,640
Yeah,

286
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,720
I heard him on NPR.

287
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,070
Oh,

288
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,903
he should have mine.

289
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,500
I'll hook you guys up.

290
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:29,900
Okay.

291
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,733
You would love it.

292
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,600
Especially when he finds out
that you invented a shrimp fest.

293
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,490
You know,

294
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,323
he would love you.

295
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:35,931
But,

296
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:36,290
um,

297
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,290
when he was explaining to me the system
through which plants exchange nutrients

298
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,180
and information with fun
guy and that fun guy.

299
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,601
Yeah.

300
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:52,601
Fun Guy actually supply these plants
with certain nutrients and they,

301
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,210
they,

302
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,380
there's like an information network of
these mycelium that's underneath the

303
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:58,214
ground.

304
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,880
That's how it is.

305
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,300
I've heard about this how like what trees
will do is communicate with each other

306
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:02,490
work.

307
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,291
When she was dying,

308
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,350
they'll send nutrients to the other,

309
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,460
I guess through my ceiling
is the context dude.

310
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,990
It's fucking bananas.

311
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:09,741
Yeah.

312
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:11,540
And it all underneath the ground,

313
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,830
underneath the ground is this whole
almost like information exchanging network

314
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,940
of fungi.

315
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:17,661
Wow.

316
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:18,161
I like this one.

317
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:18,770
Need to help.

318
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,221
Yeah,

319
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:19,521
man.

320
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:19,820
They,

321
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,910
they know when others need more resources,

322
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:26,060
they have like a socialist network
of allocation of resources.

323
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,160
It's fucking crazy.

324
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,560
Well and,

325
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,400
and they communicate with each
other and when they're being eaten,

326
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,320
please help me.

327
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,250
They know,

328
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,430
they know that other ones are being
eaten and they'll change their flavor

329
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,264
profile.

330
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,051
They're actually,

331
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:42,860
they actually make their polar leaves
more bitter to avoid predation.

332
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,881
Someone's here eating.

333
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,200
I'm fucking put up your defenses.

334
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,910
It's so cool that you can have the
sound of caterpillars chewing leaves.

335
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:54,410
You could play it like on a recording
next to a plant and that plant will change

336
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:55,850
it's flavor profile.

337
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,080
Oh Wow.

338
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:57,441
Yeah.

339
00:07:57,441 --> 00:08:00,890
They become so disgusting that giraffes
won't eat them and they'll starve to

340
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:02,480
death because it's gross.

341
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,591
Disgusting.

342
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:06,110
They're trying to get kids not to get
their nails painted with that stuff that

343
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:06,840
tastes gross.

344
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,040
No.

345
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,480
Did they do that stupid kids and her nails
the fucking kids to eat their boogers

346
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:11,781
and you're like,

347
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,460
what the fuck is wrong with you?

348
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,660
You eat your boogers
all the time with them.

349
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:18,780
When he got to do with them,

350
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,190
throw away trash receptacle for boogers.

351
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:22,910
God,

352
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,920
you put them in a tissue
and you'd be gone with them.

353
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,850
We don't eat your boogers.

354
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:27,740
You savage Rhonda boogers.

355
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,400
Wow.

356
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,880
Okay.

357
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,840
You do what you gotta do?

358
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,130
I have one of these Jerry shifts.

359
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:31,590
I,

360
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,780
this would actually my house.

361
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,051
Oh,

362
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:33,770
nice.

363
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,431
I got one of your,

364
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:34,640
uh,

365
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,780
crazy mushroom shirts.

366
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,010
Which tour was that from?

367
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,300
Do Mushrooms tour?

368
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,621
Uh,

369
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:39,890
I think it was two specials ago.

370
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:40,511
Not the last year.

371
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:41,121
Was that one.

372
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,480
And then there was another one
with you or your tongue open with,

373
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,160
with uh,

374
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,993
uh,

375
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,370
2012.

376
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,330
That's the 2012 shirts.

377
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,920
That's the coolest shirt.

378
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,020
I might not bring this back since I
fucked up and didn't do a shirt this year.

379
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,750
She's bring that back just to sell it.

380
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,070
You should just sell it period.

381
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,820
It's a cool one.

382
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,010
Yeah.

383
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,120
I liked the idea of going like,

384
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:00,840
cause cause I'm iron maiden had
that with like a shirt per year.

385
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,600
You can show it off at
the next iron man concert.

386
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:03,751
But yeah,

387
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,100
I mean if you had to be at that concert,

388
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:05,963
otherwise you're fucked.

389
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,420
That's the one I got that one
in the hot black chick on top.

390
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,171
Ted Park did that.

391
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:11,490
That's like I did the Korean Zombie shirt.

392
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,180
Oh really?

393
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,510
Yeah.

394
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:12,781
Damn.

395
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:13,270
He's good.

396
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,103
He is good.

397
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,170
That's a great fucking shirt man.

398
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,680
Yeah.

399
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,170
And your eyes sufficiently whacked out
and people are like why is Mark Marin and

400
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,013
your shirt

401
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,430
or a the guy from grateful dead matches.

402
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,010
Mark Baron went the other way,

403
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,010
super drugged out,

404
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,540
gave up on sobriety and
just went all mushrooms.

405
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,450
He's totally the other way
as a variety going mark.

406
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,261
Oh good.

407
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:35,094
You should ask.

408
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,130
I failed to put this on your doors.

409
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,211
I realize,

410
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,260
what the fuck am I doing?

411
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:41,760
Avoiding all the best parts of life.

412
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,911
Yeah,

413
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,230
that's,

414
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,680
that's teaching me this sober
October thing is teaching me a lot.

415
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,690
My bartender last night I
went to O'neill's wedding,

416
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,400
I don't knows what her and I was like,

417
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:52,020
do you have any it's out of brewery.

418
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,830
Right.

419
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,520
And uh,

420
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:53,821
I was like,

421
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:55,170
do you have any non alcoholic beer?

422
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,300
Like I was saying like it helps us social
cause socially it's fuck everyone's

423
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,153
drinking,

424
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,203
you know?

425
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,660
Um,

426
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:00,991
and he goes,

427
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:01,071
yeah,

428
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:01,904
yeah,

429
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,300
he goes sober October.

430
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:03,601
And I'm like,

431
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:03,900
yeah,

432
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,290
but he didn't,

433
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,420
he didn't know a lot of
people know this contest,

434
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:06,931
but he was just like,

435
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:07,764
I'm doing it too.

436
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,410
Did you know about it before last year?

437
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,360
Because we were going to
do it earlier or later.

438
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,010
But then Burt had an Australia thing.

439
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:14,221
I'm like,

440
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:15,390
there's no way you're doing in Australia.

441
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,390
You can't be sober in Australia and you
can't be sober for the joker's cruise.

442
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,590
And that was November,

443
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,000
I think first week in
November or something,

444
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,550
and so we'd like just settled on October,

445
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,150
so we just stumbled upon it and other
people have been doing it for years

446
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:27,984
apparently.

447
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,020
How long sober October have
been going on for a long time.

448
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,890
Yeah.

449
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,240
Jamie says long time off Mike,

450
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,010
because he doesn't realize
we're podcast share a while.

451
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,890
Oh,

452
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:36,590
who's that?

453
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,320
Oh,

454
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,520
that sounds like Austin's,

455
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,240
yeah,

456
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,530
it's apparently been going
on for a long time ago.

457
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:44,910
I was doing it completely lucked into it,

458
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,120
dude.

459
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,480
Somebody,

460
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,500
I was at the jets game,

461
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,320
somebody sent me a beer and I was like,

462
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:49,621
what?

463
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:50,890
And then I turned and there's a,

464
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,361
I was like,

465
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:51,451
oh,

466
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:51,931
I can't,

467
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:52,321
and the was like,

468
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:53,154
I was trying to catch you.

469
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,290
That's I'm doing for this dance.

470
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:55,831
Diaz things,

471
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:56,121
births,

472
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:56,760
drinking.

473
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,510
He does.

474
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,140
Wow.

475
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,590
Yeah.

476
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,071
Really?

477
00:10:59,071 --> 00:10:59,281
It was,

478
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:00,240
I think birch drinking.

479
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:00,661
He goes,

480
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,360
I saw him the other day.

481
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,193
Look guilty.

482
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,300
He ducked his head down,

483
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,134
wasn't looking at me.

484
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,700
I think he's drunk and Joe Rogan.

485
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:08,941
Oh,

486
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:10,110
I've wanted to so bad.

487
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,570
I actually needed a break
this time I went to Sushi.

488
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,310
I told you I went to Sushi and when was,

489
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:14,670
I was like,

490
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,301
Oh yeah,

491
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:16,310
get a nice cool.

492
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,530
That'll be,

493
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,030
fuck.

494
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,950
It's October.

495
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,060
God dammit.

496
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,550
It's like earaches.

497
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,250
You realize now it's not just casually
drinking that there's moments where booze

498
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:31,270
really does go well with an experienced
stake in a nice glass of red wine.

499
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,493
Yes.

500
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,680
November 5th son,

501
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,210
we're going off.

502
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,440
If I'm a fifth we're going off.

503
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,581
That's what I'm going to do.

504
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:39,750
The recap podcast.

505
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:40,584
We're all going off,

506
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,640
so Ari and I have been battling for
first place recently until today when

507
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:49,641
Thompson tourists snuck in a second
place with his 400 plus points today.

508
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,590
That really puts a pressure on me.

509
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:54,040
It really hurt me to not,

510
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,720
I finally joined a gym because of this.

511
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,830
I have two blankets,

512
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:57,431
a small gym,

513
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:01,270
but it's like right near my seven minute
walk from my apartment so I can pass on

514
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,051
the way home from the seller.

515
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:03,500
I can get a workout in
right then if I want.

516
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,090
That's good.

517
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,420
Yeah.

518
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,310
It's 24 hours as far as weekdays,

519
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,040
so it's a crazy fucking life.

520
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,680
There's a crazy life in New York too.

521
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,150
Everything's 24 there's
so many 24 hour things.

522
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,140
Restaurants,

523
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,430
pool halls.

524
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,210
Yeah.

525
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,200
I passed by that place.

526
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:18,490
We went a bunch of times.

527
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,130
Which place?

528
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,900
All the time.

529
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,290
Sudan.

530
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:20,820
Amsterdam.

531
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:20,980
Yeah.

532
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,790
That's always there.

533
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,230
That plays the only up until two.

534
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:23,770
Oh really?

535
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,310
Yeah,

536
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,420
but it's still pretty late.

537
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,610
There's a few real sketchy joints there.

538
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:28,480
24 hours.

539
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,690
But if you go in there,

540
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,140
you'll get a bunch of creeps
at want to gamble with you.

541
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,150
It looks like they're cause good.

542
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,320
I'm just trying to hit some balls,

543
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,700
trying to take my mind off things.

544
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,800
They're cracked out and trying to hustle.

545
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,510
This is very little of
that anymore though.

546
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,141
It's New York.

547
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:43,330
It's cleaned up for the
worst or the better.

548
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,560
I mean hustling pool,

549
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:45,070
hustling.

550
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,930
It's chance cause just kind of died.

551
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:47,790
Really?

552
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,180
Yeah.

553
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,290
So it was like pools dead.

554
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,670
They have like leagues now.

555
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,350
Yeah.

556
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:52,990
You know?

557
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,201
Yeah.

558
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,034
It's like,

559
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:54,550
well,

560
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,420
I mean that's good.

561
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,280
I'm just happy if people play.

562
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,480
It's a fun thing to play,

563
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:03,100
but it's dead in terms of like the way
it used to be in Manhattan where there

564
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:04,480
was just gambling everywhere.

565
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,620
You don't have to turn of the century.

566
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:07,600
There was a thousand pool
halls in New York City.

567
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,290
What?

568
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:08,860
Yeah,

569
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,570
19 hundreds the early 19
hundreds did you ever see the,

570
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:12,970
the,

571
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,880
the pool tables like outside in
Thailand when you were there?

572
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,181
No,

573
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:16,541
I didn't,

574
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,620
but I here in the Philippines.

575
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,310
It's crazy.

576
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,520
Yeah,

577
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,120
and it's just like,

578
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,450
there'll be some like an
awning or something or just
want to set up kind of like

579
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,780
people who go tailgating in those kinds
of tents and they'll be under that and

580
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:29,710
you can just pull over and
be like complete and there'll
be like white guy for

581
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:30,131
sure.

582
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:30,964
Let's play.

583
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,111
No gambling.

584
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,520
Just like having a fun time.

585
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,090
Really?

586
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:34,923
Oh yeah.

587
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,310
I saw one in Chiang Mai.

588
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:38,410
In that downtown marketplace area.

589
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,570
Yeah,

590
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,330
I saw one.

591
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,081
How Fun was that?

592
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:42,400
Fucking Thai kickboxing.

593
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,240
I'm pretty fun.

594
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,780
Thai fights.

595
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,350
So cool.

596
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,070
And they played the most,

597
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,791
the instrument,

598
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,624
right?

599
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,471
How Fun.

600
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:48,151
Fun Is that?

601
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:48,321
Yeah,

602
00:13:48,321 --> 00:13:49,154
it's pretty wild.

603
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,250
I've been to those out
here where they play it,

604
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:54,820
but Americans get real
bored with the y crew.

605
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:55,421
The dance.

606
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:56,254
They do.

607
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,411
Yeah.

608
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:57,250
They do a dance for their,

609
00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:58,270
for their own Dojo.

610
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:58,930
Yeah.

611
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,830
Well they do.

612
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,110
Everybody does it and there's
a real logic behind it.

613
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,590
The logic is that you warm up and
that you really relax yourself.

614
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,540
You're kind of performing in front of
all these dance moves and also people are

615
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,440
staring at you.

616
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,330
So it kind of wears off your nerves.

617
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,310
There's a reality to that.

618
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:15,930
It,

619
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,410
it's actually really wise,

620
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:17,961
you know,

621
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:18,490
and you lose,

622
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,320
you limber up your body to like,

623
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:23,680
a lot of the stuff they're doing is
they're getting down on one knee like a

624
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:27,760
lunge and they're bouncing a little bit
and so their limb bring up their body

625
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:30,940
and then on top of that they're actually
doing this dance in front of all these

626
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:33,040
people and it calms the
nerves a little bit.

627
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,610
Wow.

628
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:33,761
Yeah.

629
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:34,241
John Fixed,

630
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,021
we're always talking about that.

631
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:36,820
About like the idea of
people watching you.

632
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,810
It's actually a big thing.

633
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,970
And the UFC is like a bigger
people watching you it then.

634
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,611
Oh yeah.

635
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:41,111
Anywhere else.

636
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:43,060
It's a tougher people watching you.

637
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:43,830
It's fucking hot.

638
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,450
I mean people watching you
and you shoot a free throw,

639
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,110
you know?

640
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,831
Good Dude.

641
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:48,664
Good Dude.

642
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,541
Bunch of people watch it.

643
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:49,871
Oh fuck.

644
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:50,261
Here we go.

645
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:50,860
Here we go.

646
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,500
That's real.

647
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,000
Even if it's just like
five of your friends.

648
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,913
Yeah.

649
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,063
Yeah.

650
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,670
Pressure.

651
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,380
The pressure's and fucking real man.

652
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:57,651
I mean,

653
00:14:57,651 --> 00:14:59,960
that's what everybody's most
terrified about what we do.

654
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,363
Public speaking.

655
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,930
I had somebody that we were giving
a talk on Shakespeare's home.

656
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,440
It was a group project.

657
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,880
We each had to write one paragraph.

658
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,040
We wrote three paragraphs
at each one of us read one,

659
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,320
so I think I read mine,

660
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,440
just reading it off a paper.

661
00:15:13,441 --> 00:15:14,210
It was paying attention.

662
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,043
The next day was like,

663
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,830
and then later Shakespeare
had the off time

664
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,350
and was just looking at her like,

665
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:22,071
what the fuck?

666
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:22,660
And the teacher was like,

667
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,001
okay,

668
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:23,241
okay,

669
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:23,450
okay.

670
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:23,931
It's all right.

671
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:24,281
Let's start.

672
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:25,520
Let's start with always on wheels route.

673
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,271
And I was like,

674
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:27,530
what the fuck is wrong with you?

675
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,480
It's a phrase he is waiting.

676
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:30,314
It was a standup,

677
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,450
but like to make any sense,

678
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,300
I used to panic when I
would talk to bank towers.

679
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,050
What?

680
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,290
Yeah.

681
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,140
I used to go to a bank till I get super
nervous right before I'd have to talk to

682
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:39,950
a bank teller.

683
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,610
Why?

684
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,443
I Dunno.

685
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,343
It's no reason for it.

686
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,520
When I was a kid I've,

687
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,960
I really felt like a loser.

688
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,981
I really did.

689
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:50,960
I had like serious low self esteem issues
up until like high school you up until

690
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:51,794
martial arts.

691
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,620
And then once I started doing martial
arts and getting really good at it and

692
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,454
then teaching,

693
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,420
it kind of calmed me down
experience and then it kind of like,

694
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:00,020
was it,

695
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,040
believe it or not,

696
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,080
almost like a natural path to stand up.

697
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,440
But I remember before that being very
awkward talking to people like very

698
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,850
nervous talking to people I didn't know,

699
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,231
you know,

700
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:13,064
just didn't,

701
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,830
didn't feel like I still
get that where I'm like,

702
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,970
I don't know how to talk.

703
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:17,650
Yeah.

704
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,361
Just trying to draw.

705
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:19,194
I don't know how to talk to.

706
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,941
Yeah,

707
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:20,271
I know.

708
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:20,541
Right.

709
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:25,541
Especially if it's an odd thing and you
know what was worse when I know you too

710
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:27,980
and ask your questions are so broad.

711
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:29,210
What's Joey Diaz like?

712
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,133
Oh boy.

713
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,350
Yeah,

714
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,090
that's,

715
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:32,923
that's hard.

716
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,270
He met a good to ask you a question.

717
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:34,580
Uh,

718
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,630
which I do for a living,

719
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,360
uh,

720
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,470
trying to get my shit together.

721
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,160
Okay.

722
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,880
Fire,

723
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,500
fire truck operator.

724
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,280
Yeah.

725
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,780
You should make ladders.

726
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,141
Yeah.

727
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:45,720
Like what?

728
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,010
I don't know anything about you.

729
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,620
What are you talking about?

730
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,890
You know you used to be a carpenter
but I don't want to do it anymore.

731
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,030
Okay.

732
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,880
I'm thinking I'm doing standup.

733
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,550
Should I do it like definitely no,

734
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,130
go for it.

735
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,860
How would you want I say go for it.

736
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:58,580
Sure.

737
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,810
I guess if you want to do it,

738
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:00,320
do it.

739
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,691
Yeah.

740
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:02,030
Like everything is like that,

741
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,871
but if it doesn't work out,

742
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:03,704
don't get mad at me.

743
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,461
I'm like,

744
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:04,641
no,

745
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:05,810
I'm not being responsible for this.

746
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:05,940
Oh,

747
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,130
you told me to become a fight or no,

748
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:08,090
I'm all fucked up.

749
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,920
He told me to do what you do too.

750
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:10,760
I've got a broken arm now,

751
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:11,210
bro.

752
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,080
Who's going to fix this?

753
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:12,910
Huh?

754
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,280
Huh?

755
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,910
You Bro.

756
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,743
That's the answer.

757
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,520
You motherfucker fix that shit.

758
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,780
Don't get it fixed.

759
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,393
Yeah.

760
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,620
I was talking to a friend of mine who,

761
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:22,220
uh,

762
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,900
I want to name his name cause he got
a pretty significant injury and um,

763
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,870
we were talking about,

764
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:27,230
uh,

765
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,810
his injury and it's fucking bad man.

766
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,381
You know,

767
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,840
he needs surgery and he,

768
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,810
his bone is changing shape
because of arthritis.

769
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:37,070
It's building up in his joint.

770
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:37,311
I'm like,

771
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:38,150
Oh fuck.

772
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,180
And he's a young guy and he just makes
you realize like the fucking punishment

773
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,770
these guys are putting on their body.

774
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:50,790
And that's like totally below the surface
that people don't know it's behind the

775
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:51,834
curtain.

776
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,920
No one knows about it.

777
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,260
And they've got like these
devastating injuries at,

778
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:59,190
they're fighting off and then competing
against worldclass fighters with

779
00:17:59,191 --> 00:17:59,790
injuries.

780
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,150
He's torn ligaments and Tony Ferguson,

781
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:03,361
he's like,

782
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:05,070
he doesn't look comfortable on that leg.

783
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,970
No.

784
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,480
And he's like,

785
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,810
yeah,

786
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,560
it wasn't,

787
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:07,951
you know what?

788
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:12,951
He went six months from catastrophic
knee injury where the bone literally

789
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:14,310
separated from the ligament.

790
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:15,630
The ligament tore off the boat.

791
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:16,870
You ever see the,

792
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,270
the,

793
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,720
the picture of his surgery?

794
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,140
Oh,

795
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,230
Jayman push it up,

796
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,330
pull that shit up.

797
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:21,990
Chain.

798
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,670
It's a crazy surgery because it's,

799
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,080
I'm not exaggerating,

800
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:26,790
it might be a 12 inch scar.

801
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,660
It's enormous.

802
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:31,050
It's like that big and it's all
jagged and shit and it's just,

803
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,460
he ripped it apart.

804
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:34,620
They had an open amount of 12 months,

805
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,760
not even six months.

806
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:36,151
Six months.

807
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:36,361
I mean,

808
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:36,690
yeah.

809
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,320
Insane.

810
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,720
I don't understand how that,

811
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:40,350
that guy doesn't clearly
get the title shot.

812
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:40,980
He does.

813
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,280
He does.

814
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,120
We should talk about that.

815
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:42,840
Look at that.

816
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,100
Wow.

817
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:44,850
That's crazy.

818
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,850
And the thing is that was just from a
trip he just tripped was fucking bananas.

819
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:53,760
Yeah.

820
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,170
What's the second image,

821
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:56,004
Jeremy?

822
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,481
Oh,

823
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:58,314
the other side.

824
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,263
Yeah.

825
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,223
Yeah,

826
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:00,511
yeah.

827
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:01,344
The um,

828
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,060
the extent of that injury.

829
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,250
The,

830
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,020
the fact that he came back in six months
and what's really interesting is he

831
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,010
came back in six months.

832
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:09,360
He didn't spar apparently.

833
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,360
Really need to talk to him about this
and I'm going to have him on with Eddie.

834
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,290
Um,

835
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,400
he didn't spar.

836
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,840
He just prepared.

837
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,710
Prepared.

838
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,981
Yeah.

839
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,390
He's want to Eddie's black belts.

840
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:18,841
Wow.

841
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:19,350
Really?

842
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,960
Yeah.

843
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,470
To,

844
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,303
he's a black belt.

845
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,423
You should be.

846
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,750
I think he is.

847
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,510
I'm pretty sure it's fine.

848
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,850
I'm fine.

849
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,320
I'm pretty sure Eddie gave him his
black belt after he submitted Kevin Lee.

850
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,011
He did.

851
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:29,844
Yeah.

852
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,750
Um,

853
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,051
yeah.

854
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:31,860
He's uh,

855
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,910
he's 10th Planet Guy.

856
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,510
Wow.

857
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,170
That's pretty cool.

858
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,280
It's pretty bad ass.

859
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,500
He's got a nasty Darce choke probably.

860
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:38,980
He should clearly get the title shot.

861
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,410
It doesn't make sense to me.

862
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:42,930
Even that when he came back he
shouldn't have even gotten stripped.

863
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,030
In hindsight.

864
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,900
I agree 100% and then it's like you have
copy Ayp is the title holder fair and

865
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:49,591
square I guess.

866
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:50,910
But like you never beat the champion.

867
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,091
Well,

868
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:54,680
he's more of a legit title holder in
my opinion than could be blessed before

869
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,380
Connor because he didn't ally Quinta who
wasn't even supposed to be fighting for

870
00:19:58,381 --> 00:19:59,130
the title.

871
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,660
Whereas Kevin Lee is a way
more like Ferguson got it from,

872
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,280
well Ferguson Fuck Kevin leak for the
interim title because Connor left it.

873
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,610
But Kevin Lee prepared for Tony Ferguson.

874
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,390
They met,

875
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,680
they fought for the interim title and
Kevin Lee is like a top contender.

876
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,603
Right?

877
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,680
He's a fucking tough guy.

878
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:20,940
Obviously he went five rounds with,

879
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:22,590
could be Connor couldn't
go five rounds with,

880
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:22,950
could be.

881
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,461
And He,

882
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:23,671
you know,

883
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:25,140
he put up resistance.

884
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,621
It was,

885
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:26,850
it was a good fight.

886
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,740
He would never make anyone a title shot.

887
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,610
No.

888
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,290
Maybe in the discussion.

889
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,390
Well he's fighting Kevin Lee.

890
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:33,480
If he beats Kevin Lee,

891
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,630
he,

892
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,030
that's the next cat look.

893
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,280
Ally Quinta is fucking legit.

894
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,600
He's very legit.

895
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:40,500
He's underrated.

896
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,420
Like really underrated in my opinion.

897
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,411
I think he's,

898
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:45,060
the way he got up from Khabib,

899
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:45,781
taken him down.

900
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:46,830
Nobody's been able to do that.

901
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,160
He got up like

902
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,120
pretty consistently,

903
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,830
took very little damage on the ground.

904
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:51,221
Wasn't,

905
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:52,070
wasn't copied,

906
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,430
was never able to pound him
out the way he pounded out.

907
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:55,030
Connor,

908
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,080
if you go back and watch ally Quinta
versus Khabib and Connor versus could be,

909
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,710
you realize how fucking
good ally Quinta is.

910
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,760
Just ton of nothing on the ground.

911
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,910
Well he didn't in that fight.

912
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,540
Really.

913
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:06,870
That's,

914
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,570
that's when Mendez took him down on
two weeks notice and it was like if he

915
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:10,751
didn't,

916
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:11,950
Gas Mendez would have beat him.

917
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,490
It's true.

918
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,970
It's like he can't fight them right

919
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,610
ground.

920
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,443
Well,

921
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,670
he did very well in the
ground and gets Max Holloway,

922
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,820
which was a early in Max's career.

923
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,580
Max was only like 21 at the time.

924
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,193
But uh,

925
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,550
I agree with you.

926
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,570
That's definitely his weakest part
of his game and the strongest part of

927
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:31,350
Khabib's game.

928
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,880
My point was just that ally Quinta did
not get beat up on the ground like that

929
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:37,440
did not get close to being stopped,

930
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:40,470
went full five rounds and
could be clearly won the fight.

931
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,680
But Alec went to provided resistance and
provided more of a struggle than Conor

932
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:46,080
did.

933
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,240
I to honestly thanks to some of the
reason that's holding la Quinta back from

934
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,390
the fans being from them thinking
of him as like a top is his name.

935
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,403
It's just not,

936
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,140
he has a name of someone who would be
like in the early route of Mike Tyson's

937
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:56,974
punch out.

938
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,701
You say that,

939
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:59,980
but if you started
starching world champions,

940
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:01,510
nobody would give a fuck about his name.

941
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,230
If he went out there and destroyed could
beam and fucking head kicked him into

942
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:06,064
another dimension.

943
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,340
True.

944
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:06,940
Good point.

945
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,330
Good point.

946
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,790
Nobody would give him some of talking
about like how hot like celebrities are

947
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,650
and like you wouldn't say that
if he wasn't a nine movies.

948
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:12,611
Like,

949
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:13,180
who?

950
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,810
I don't know,

951
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,070
like Ryan Reynolds is pretty hot.

952
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,251
Yeah.

953
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,050
Things like that.

954
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:16,420
Really?

955
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:16,900
Yeah.

956
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,441
The Moon Guy.

957
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,274
He's in the movie,

958
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:18,820
right?

959
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,470
Or maybe like day,

960
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,770
even like day and people
like is good looking.

961
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,480
I'm like,

962
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,060
fuck yeah,

963
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,170
but like even back then it was like,

964
00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:23,560
but it's like,

965
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:23,771
no,

966
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:24,604
he's fine,

967
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,331
he's fine.

968
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:27,670
But for a comedian for super successful,

969
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:28,000
so you're like,

970
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,241
oh,

971
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:28,841
this guy's hot.

972
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:29,081
It's like,

973
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:29,980
not really.

974
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,000
Not like,

975
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,873
uh,

976
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,360
um,

977
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:32,800
uh,

978
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,633
Jeremy Renner.

979
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,300
I remember him on commercial days
and it was like good looking guy.

980
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:40,180
But now people are like so gorgeous and
it's like that's success is on that.

981
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:40,721
That's true.

982
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:41,050
Yeah.

983
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,883
For gals.

984
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:42,401
And then funding,

985
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:45,220
it doesn't work like that
with girls at all at all.

986
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,001
And matter of fact,

987
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:47,230
it makes them look a little gross.

988
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,220
What if they're,

989
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,610
if they're,

990
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,480
if they're more successful,

991
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,840
super successful and not
that good looking like,

992
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,410
you know,

993
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,370
it works the opposite.

994
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:56,800
If they're gross looking
and then it gets successful.

995
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,663
Like Joan Jett,

996
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,571
Oh fuck Joan Jett.

997
00:22:58,571 --> 00:22:59,410
Now Joan jets.

998
00:22:59,411 --> 00:22:59,890
Hot Man.

999
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,220
Yeah.

1000
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,270
Joan jets always been hot.

1001
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:01,651
But in the,

1002
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:02,720
in the Harvey,

1003
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,200
there's these women without
their fame are like,

1004
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,160
get away from me.

1005
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,610
Really?

1006
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,030
We're talking Joan Jett.

1007
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,940
I love rock and roll.

1008
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,640
Put another dime that jukebox
babies get outta here.

1009
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,240
Go put a diamond.

1010
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,320
The jukebox or disgusting.

1011
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,423
Why?

1012
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,080
I disagree strongly.

1013
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:18,590
I'm saying it's only because of her fame.

1014
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,250
I always thought she was
hot and I know you did,

1015
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,840
but when I was in high school,

1016
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,680
yeah,

1017
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,330
well she was hot when
I was in high school.

1018
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,640
Like Joan jet is probably 155 years old.

1019
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:27,830
Yeah.

1020
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,230
She's playing like Dewey beach next week.

1021
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,900
She said the Canyon Club,

1022
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,640
which should look like now.

1023
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,080
She looks like a,

1024
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,190
okay,

1025
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,330
well that's a little too issue.

1026
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,970
That's Sharon Osborne.

1027
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,940
Yeah.

1028
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,920
You got the wrong photo.

1029
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,521
No,

1030
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,120
that's her.

1031
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,953
I know Joe.

1032
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,681
I was like,

1033
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:44,891
wait,

1034
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:45,724
what?

1035
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,600
At first I used to look
like are they're like,

1036
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,340
yeah,

1037
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,173
well you know,

1038
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,660
fucking father time fucks
is all me father time.

1039
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,620
Yeah.

1040
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:54,891
Anyway,

1041
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,930
the reason I wanted to
come out here talking MMA.

1042
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,350
Yeah.

1043
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,260
It's because I had this unique
experience that a lot of people,

1044
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:01,640
like I mentioned at
sometimes and they're like,

1045
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:01,731
oh,

1046
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,511
you've been to a UFC.

1047
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:02,870
I'm like,

1048
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,081
dude,

1049
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:04,730
I've been to like 50 of them.

1050
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,480
And they're like,

1051
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,313
how?

1052
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:12,080
It was just this cool thing where I guess
in your contract early on you got this

1053
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:12,351
deal,

1054
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:16,970
you get a free companion flight and a
free companion hotel and then you started

1055
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:20,690
inviting us and then we started doing
comedy shows on Friday night after the

1056
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:23,090
weigh ins and then it became like a thing.

1057
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,370
And so these weekends we do one big show
and then go to the weigh ins and have

1058
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,020
and have a,

1059
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,030
the actual UFC the next day.

1060
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:35,660
It was just this fun weekend full of
like doing something stand up and also

1061
00:24:35,661 --> 00:24:36,320
having fun.

1062
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,471
Well,

1063
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:41,471
how about the classic example of you and
Dunkin kissing is a good way to start

1064
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,980
right away,

1065
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,490
right?

1066
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,151
It wasn't boring.

1067
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,410
It was a fucking wrestling fight.

1068
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,090
There was boring.

1069
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,650
And so you guys wait
until the camera came?

1070
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:54,900
Yeah,

1071
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,100
it was on the grout
and then you'd charity.

1072
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,820
I couldn't stop looking at prostate
and I wish I had held it longer.

1073
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:02,421
Oh,

1074
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:05,510
it's Nate Marquardt that's
Marquardt was fighting somebody.

1075
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,020
Um,

1076
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,210
uh,

1077
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:06,381
yeah,

1078
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,700
we were given Illuminati sign.

1079
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,031
Don't get,

1080
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:10,800
doesn't sit up there normally
frosty was always really cool,

1081
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,530
but that's up there and
make us feel welcome.

1082
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,393
You know?

1083
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,281
Frosties great guy.

1084
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:14,540
Yeah,

1085
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,373
great guy.

1086
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,303
And uh,

1087
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,181
and then Dunkin was like,

1088
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:19,040
let's give Illuminati signs
because he's up there.

1089
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:19,160
He,

1090
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,331
he,

1091
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:21,200
he doesn't really care about the sport.

1092
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,010
So were just looking
at the monitors saying,

1093
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,701
seeing the Puck,

1094
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:24,710
a technique of all of it,

1095
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:27,020
of what goes into like
the fucking filming of it.

1096
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:28,641
Yeah.

1097
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:31,220
We got to get a joint illuminati.

1098
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:32,054
China

1099
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,400
right behind Joe Silva

1100
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:40,730
people.

1101
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,211
They're really,

1102
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:42,260
really dumb people.

1103
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:44,000
They think you guys are
really in the Illuminati.

1104
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,711
People have been saying,

1105
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:45,831
look,

1106
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:46,550
you're in Illuminati.

1107
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,061
I know you are.

1108
00:25:47,061 --> 00:25:47,750
You and Rogan.

1109
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,460
I get people all the time saying,

1110
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:50,360
I'm in the CIA.

1111
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,590
That's great.

1112
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,360
That's great.

1113
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,340
What a terrible opera view.

1114
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:54,320
Or if they uncovered it,

1115
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,900
could you imagine if that
was the secret to my career?

1116
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,930
Like all the other stuff was just so I
could just portray a normal person drug

1117
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:06,290
use history of martial arts,

1118
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,430
getting in with the UFC,

1119
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:12,230
becoming the commentator public
though to be a CIO seat just to be,

1120
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:13,490
it's like so I can go deep,

1121
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:15,140
deep undercover and nobody would buy it.

1122
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,520
It's like what?

1123
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,150
You just be better to be a garbage man?

1124
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,591
Like Nah,

1125
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:19,940
this is no one would suspect this.

1126
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,690
There's people that just want to
believe the dumbest fucking conspiracies

1127
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:24,524
period.

1128
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,480
The dumbest conspiracies.

1129
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,700
Like there was some fucking guy,

1130
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:33,790
one of those info bores guy that was
promoting something recently that Hillary

1131
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,480
was 50% reptilian.

1132
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,220
50% I've heard 30% I could believe,

1133
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,980
but 50 50 is a wall half.

1134
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:40,461
Yeah.

1135
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:41,294
See if you can find that.

1136
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,100
Someone said she has 50% reptilian

1137
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,940
blood.

1138
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,400
Well you know that was a David
Eick thing for the longest time.

1139
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,181
The reptilians.

1140
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:48,421
Yeah,

1141
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:50,340
I remember he was saying he
won't talk about that now.

1142
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:53,700
Apparently he's angry when people bring
up reptilians cause it's embarrassing

1143
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,300
because he was like,

1144
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,080
I shouldn't have believed that.

1145
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,261
Yeah.

1146
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:56,900
What's a fucking fool heart will hit.

1147
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,650
And then he became way more mainstream
and then the internet came along and they

1148
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:00,901
were like,

1149
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:01,410
hey,

1150
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,960
you remember that fucking reptilian thing?

1151
00:27:03,961 --> 00:27:07,170
That's the crazy shit of all to
have an answer for that either.

1152
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:07,501
Oh yeah.

1153
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,060
I was just making that up for whatever,

1154
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:11,010
what I was back in the
early days of Internet,

1155
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:14,700
or I believed it or like I believe
that now I realize how crazy that was.

1156
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,510
Yeah.

1157
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,440
You can say that,

1158
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,640
but not like don't bring it up.

1159
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,563
Yeah.

1160
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,290
There's,

1161
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:19,710
I mean,

1162
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,130
look,

1163
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,090
there's fucking,

1164
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,350
there's real conspiracy.

1165
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:22,830
You know that,

1166
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,640
um,

1167
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,520
that story about that journalist that
was killed by the Saudis this week.

1168
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,150
[inaudible]

1169
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,983
that's real.

1170
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,740
But he was killed.

1171
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:28,891
Yeah.

1172
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:30,630
They finally admitted
that they killed him.

1173
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,350
The Saudis said,

1174
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,860
yeah.

1175
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,330
They said that they killed him in a fight,

1176
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,350
which is,

1177
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,660
if you see the guy you like,

1178
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:35,950
fuck,

1179
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,230
this guy's not fighting anyone.

1180
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,083
Yeah.

1181
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,840
And some of the,

1182
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,570
the crown prince's top people,

1183
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,080
top security people have been released
apparently probably gave him a fucking

1184
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,340
$100 million and said,

1185
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:48,420
go chill on a beach somewhere.

1186
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,490
Wow.

1187
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,590
And we said one of them too was like
died in a car accident this week.

1188
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,810
I don't know quote that
kill a lot of journalists,

1189
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:55,510
man.

1190
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:55,650
No,

1191
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,380
not a journalist.

1192
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,360
One of the info wars,

1193
00:27:57,361 --> 00:28:01,830
real news Twitter band after
MSM outcry over Hillary satire.

1194
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,450
So it was a satire piece.

1195
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,890
I just found the piece and I was like,

1196
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,300
there's no way that this is real.

1197
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:07,290
They thought it was that tire.

1198
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,370
I don't know who did,

1199
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:09,570
but can I just tell you about,

1200
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,500
about Hillary Clinton?

1201
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,190
We this DNA test proving she's only
half lizard person all the way up,

1202
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,110
but like she's doing,

1203
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,130
she relates it to clear her name.

1204
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,360
Did you know Elizabeth Warren released
that thing that says that she's got

1205
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:22,680
actual native American blood,

1206
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,690
but it's literally like one,

1207
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:27,960
100024th fucking million trillion.

1208
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,430
Wow.

1209
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,880
She has like the smallest amount of your
bench of Shapiro tweeted about that.

1210
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,420
What'd he say?

1211
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,211
Oh Fuck Jay.

1212
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:35,044
We've tried to find it.

1213
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:35,731
Your great,

1214
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:35,941
great,

1215
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:36,181
great,

1216
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:36,421
great,

1217
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:37,490
great grandfathers.

1218
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,390
But,

1219
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,300
and then it was something else,

1220
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,950
but I forgot what it was.

1221
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,193
See if we could find it.

1222
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,540
But I think I'm 1.6% African.

1223
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,280
I did one of those DNA tests.

1224
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,390
Yeah,

1225
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,223
and I'm done.

1226
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,343
Have standards.

1227
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,203
Goodbye.

1228
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:59,210
I think I'm at least 10 times
more African than Hershey issues.

1229
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,540
Native American.

1230
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,290
Wow.

1231
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,640
That's how ridiculous it is.

1232
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,970
I might be wrong with these numbers
because Jamie and I were trying to work it

1233
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:07,140
out and we're both stupid.

1234
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:07,561
It's fun.

1235
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:08,281
She released that.

1236
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:09,900
It's like c instead of going like,

1237
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,021
oh,

1238
00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:10,691
I guess I'm not that.

1239
00:29:10,691 --> 00:29:11,910
She was lying.

1240
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,810
She was also lied to.

1241
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,621
Probably her family was like,

1242
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:13,711
well,

1243
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:17,520
you know we have native and have something
like that does happen when people do

1244
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:17,790
check.

1245
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,623
Like Jamie.

1246
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,370
Jamie thought he had a gang
gang of native American enemies.

1247
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,650
A chat supposedly do.

1248
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,491
It's hard to prove.

1249
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:24,960
It's from what I'm trying to find out.

1250
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,290
Right.

1251
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,580
I can't wait to do one of those tests.

1252
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:30,020
I just have it to see if
I'm over 90% 7% Jewish,

1253
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,580
other 97% Jewish.

1254
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,560
Mine is almost exactly what I thought.

1255
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,120
It's mostly Italian.

1256
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,810
It's some other European
like Irish and English.

1257
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,890
You've got to be part monkey.

1258
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:41,471
Yeah.

1259
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:41,861
There's some,

1260
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:42,040
does

1261
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,140
some neanderthal I found
the editorial in there.

1262
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:44,920
Yeah.

1263
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,290
57% more than the average
person park on that.

1264
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,080
No,

1265
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,490
he was trying to prove that he was a
minority so we can claim victim hood.

1266
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,160
I know,

1267
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,911
I know to take the test,

1268
00:29:52,911 --> 00:29:53,800
the swab your mouth.

1269
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:56,380
So of course he found an native American
and just started making out with them

1270
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,523
swab.

1271
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,620
And I know who like came up kind of weird.

1272
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,460
They're like 98% native Americans
so we can get a blood test.

1273
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:08,770
And it wasn't any minority except he
was like 2% neanderthal and he goes,

1274
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,100
no,

1275
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,150
you white people out,

1276
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,320
you raped by people.

1277
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,280
And that's great.

1278
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,163
Yeah.

1279
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,740
Stand marsh is a great character.

1280
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,430
Uh,

1281
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:15,641
yeah.

1282
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:16,101
So anyway,

1283
00:30:16,101 --> 00:30:16,930
the was and done.

1284
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,860
So we're doing that.

1285
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,890
We keep trying to get on
the field Menotti side,

1286
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,460
he can see the Monitor,

1287
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,050
the Monitor on your table.

1288
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,540
Yeah.

1289
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,620
And so he goes,

1290
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:23,831
you know,

1291
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:24,730
next time we have to kiss.

1292
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,593
And I was like,

1293
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,623
aw.

1294
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,650
Because as a person I'm like,

1295
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:30,700
I don't want to do that.

1296
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,960
But as a comic I'm like,

1297
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,141
Oh,

1298
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:32,910
I have no choice.

1299
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,080
Yeah.

1300
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,240
Obviously that's the right move.

1301
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,261
It was like,

1302
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:36,010
God dammit.

1303
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:36,590
So all my,

1304
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,780
I'm watching this fight.

1305
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,110
Tell me when it is time and
then a minute later he goes,

1306
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,950
now that's how he just touched tongs.

1307
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:45,970
Uh,

1308
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,361
I mean we,

1309
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:46,461
yeah,

1310
00:30:46,461 --> 00:30:47,470
we wrapped it around a little.

1311
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,070
Woo.

1312
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,730
Got To enjoy it.

1313
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:48,891
No,

1314
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:49,141
I don't,

1315
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:50,170
I don't think we touched on.

1316
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,280
Maybe we did.

1317
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,860
I think he,

1318
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,080
he might might've actually,

1319
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:54,370
I think it was a real kiss.

1320
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,140
The frost.

1321
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,170
He's just watching the Monitor.

1322
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:57,100
It's not even looking at us.

1323
00:30:57,101 --> 00:30:57,820
He was like,

1324
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,500
I wish I had held a
little log that in this.

1325
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:00,520
I thought it was over.

1326
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,641
Yeah.

1327
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:04,180
That's intense.

1328
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,260
You grabbed his face too.

1329
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:06,250
Like you really loved him.

1330
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,761
Oh yeah.

1331
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:07,211
I did.

1332
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:11,740
And put his hand on your shoulder and
sort of like a submissive stance and look

1333
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:13,930
at Joe Silva just fight as interesting.

1334
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,880
She'll sell these guy's hands crossed.

1335
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,180
Totally oblivious to the homosexual
activity going on behind his was back when

1336
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:20,800
the fighters could actually
make a living in a,

1337
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,300
in a sponsorship.

1338
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,320
Oh yeah.

1339
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,950
We're get a short wouldn't sponsor.

1340
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,700
That's a big selling point for Bella
tour for a lot of fighters come here and

1341
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:31,630
actually make some cash.

1342
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,290
Well,

1343
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,950
there's a lot more money to be
made if you can get sponsors.

1344
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,700
I mean,

1345
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,670
shop was making more
than $150,000 a fight.

1346
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:40,850
John is short sponsors.

1347
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,480
Yeah.

1348
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:41,630
Yeah,

1349
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,000
and that flag behind you afterwards,

1350
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,170
a flag behind you,

1351
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,040
the shorts.

1352
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,450
They quickly rush to put the tee shirt
on and tee shirts around the week of the

1353
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:49,930
fight.

1354
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:50,290
Like,

1355
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:50,591
you know,

1356
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:52,750
people would pay you to wear it
for all your training footage.

1357
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,330
Oh really?

1358
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:53,530
Yeah.

1359
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,810
I remember when the sponsor,

1360
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:56,950
I remember when they did away with it,

1361
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:57,790
the fighters going,

1362
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,181
hey,

1363
00:31:58,181 --> 00:31:59,260
come to fucking,

1364
00:31:59,410 --> 00:31:59,591
you know,

1365
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:00,251
whatever nightclub.

1366
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,084
Come to shush.

1367
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,850
We're going to be shorter and I'm
going to stump fucking nightclubs.

1368
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,733
They haven't begun.

1369
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,250
I have to parties.

1370
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:06,750
It's shush.

1371
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,583
Yeah.

1372
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:11,200
Someone's going to open up
a and then they're like,

1373
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:11,741
hey guys,

1374
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:12,431
you can't do that anymore.

1375
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,264
It's gross.

1376
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,040
I think that came out of the time,

1377
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:15,820
by the way.

1378
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,950
I remember one of the
earlier ones in Sacramento.

1379
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,371
I see.

1380
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,270
I got to see,

1381
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,490
luckily not from when you were in the UFC,

1382
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,700
but from this middle range to where it
is now of like all the fighters would say

1383
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:30,230
at the same hotel and like we'd
have the after party there.

1384
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,570
We'd all hang out,

1385
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,510
four or five fans would
show up who knew about it,

1386
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,540
but generally it was just a way you can
drink with Keith Jardeen and all these

1387
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:38,640
guys and late times,

1388
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,860
great times.

1389
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,750
I remember you eventually
had to make a decision like,

1390
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,591
I can't be here anymore.

1391
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:42,681
It's,

1392
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:44,000
it could become overrun with fans,

1393
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,250
but for a while it was awesome.

1394
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:46,820
Yeah.

1395
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,400
The ring card girl would
hae two things changed.

1396
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,780
One cell phones with cameras,

1397
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,040
they changed because it used to
be would just want to say hi.

1398
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,790
Then it was everyone had a phone out
and they all wanted to take a photo and

1399
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,680
they would wait for you
in the elevator bank.

1400
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,580
So you would get out of the elevator and
there would be 50 people there and you

1401
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:05,414
couldn't go anywhere.

1402
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,910
You always so late to the event like,

1403
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,371
I can't,

1404
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:08,140
I have to go.

1405
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,360
Yeah,

1406
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,590
I should've left 20 minutes ago.

1407
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,461
What about the fence?

1408
00:33:10,461 --> 00:33:10,760
I'm like,

1409
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,660
I'm doing my job.

1410
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,520
Do my job.

1411
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,940
Do it for a million fans so you
for don't really matter as much.

1412
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,590
Running to the fucking way ends.

1413
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:19,670
These guys are starving to death
right now and I got to get there.

1414
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:21,500
I can't be late for the
Wayne's is televised.

1415
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:21,900
No,

1416
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,290
but people would get so angry
if he didn't take their photo,

1417
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,060
but it was such good times.

1418
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:27,110
I remember it in Sacramento.

1419
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:31,190
There was a hotel bar are all at and
it was like this is fucking awesome.

1420
00:33:31,191 --> 00:33:32,450
Hanging out casually.

1421
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,700
You happen to get into
conversations with fighters.

1422
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,530
Yup.

1423
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,141
Trainers,

1424
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:36,951
della grotty.

1425
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:37,641
People like that.

1426
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:38,480
You just talk.

1427
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:38,810
Yeah,

1428
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,980
it completely changed.

1429
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,360
It completely changed as a,

1430
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,800
well 2005 is really when it changed
because that's when the ultimate fighter

1431
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,700
came on and when the ultimate
fighter took off in the sport became,

1432
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,170
it just became much bigger,

1433
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,120
like almost within a year.

1434
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,500
It was like significantly bigger and then
it kept going and then 2000 like what

1435
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:59,240
was the iPhone 2007

1436
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,640
six ish.

1437
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,700
That's when shit really changed
with the cameras on the phones.

1438
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:06,470
Matt come then to eight,

1439
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:08,150
nine and then I was like,

1440
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:09,050
I can't do this anymore.

1441
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:10,760
I have to because we would do shows.

1442
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,560
I've got to go to Dennis Hotel.

1443
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,940
Well there was no way.

1444
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,290
It was just too crazy.

1445
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,260
It's like you would get
stocked coming into the hotel.

1446
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:20,000
You get stocked leaving the hotel.

1447
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:22,010
People would find your door
and knock on your door.

1448
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,560
But it wasn't like that and it was so fun.

1449
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,430
It was so fun.

1450
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,360
Um,

1451
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,460
yeah we were there in
the fucking salad days.

1452
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:33,000
I remember you're doing the weigh ins
once in I believe Fort Lauderdale and this

1453
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,180
week we were walking to
there with a tap out guys.

1454
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:35,760
Yeah.

1455
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,570
I remember scrape telling me scrape
ed mass thing like we found it,

1456
00:34:38,571 --> 00:34:40,670
this is before the iPhone
actually cause he was like,

1457
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:42,440
we found out a way to crank texts people.

1458
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,640
What you do is you put in 10
different contacts of a text,

1459
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,190
all the same number and they say,

1460
00:34:49,191 --> 00:34:49,401
hey,

1461
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:50,150
how you doing?

1462
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,130
And then they would just
get 10 individual texts.

1463
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,300
That's it's,

1464
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,380
you just keep doing that.

1465
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,143
Fucking stupid.

1466
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:56,420
Yeah.

1467
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,470
They would take pictures of people,

1468
00:34:57,471 --> 00:35:00,440
but I remember you doing the way
it's going and it was back then,

1469
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:01,940
it was only the camps showed up.

1470
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,211
Yeah,

1471
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:02,900
it was small.

1472
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,590
Yeah.

1473
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,640
It was just an a in a,

1474
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,170
like a hall,

1475
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,501
you know,

1476
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:07,191
not a hallway,

1477
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:08,024
but like a cup,

1478
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,340
like a banquet hall and you go,

1479
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:10,780
Oh,

1480
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,810
you're almost brought you up.

1481
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,121
I was like,

1482
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:14,211
Oh,

1483
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:15,230
I wish you would have to.

1484
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,440
I was like,

1485
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,890
I would have for sure gotten naked

1486
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,980
and nobody would have stopped that.

1487
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,941
There wouldn't be like,

1488
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:23,600
ha ha.

1489
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,300
I would've gone up their wait
in like a lot of the stuff,

1490
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:29,030
like imagine if the UFC
was going to hire me today.

1491
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,410
They're like,

1492
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,000
watch one episode of the podcast.

1493
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:33,000
So I was getting fucked off.

1494
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,540
Cleaned it up a little bit.

1495
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,180
Yeah.

1496
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,500
William Morris wouldn't allow that.

1497
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,240
He like

1498
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:38,820
with,

1499
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,181
yeah,

1500
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:39,961
I mean they'd be like,

1501
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:41,520
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

1502
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,330
There's no way.

1503
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,110
Yeah,

1504
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,591
let's get,

1505
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:44,950
let's get Jeff probes.

1506
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,043
Yes.

1507
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,790
That guy.

1508
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,890
He knows a lot about
MMA because it really,

1509
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:50,190
no,

1510
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,341
no.

1511
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:51,174
Okay.

1512
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,091
And that's not sure.

1513
00:35:52,091 --> 00:35:52,770
And I was born.

1514
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:52,921
Yeah,

1515
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:56,320
but it was such fucking wild west crazy
shit and I was just getting it there.

1516
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,270
Just start trading with Eddie.

1517
00:35:57,271 --> 00:35:58,320
You started paying for that.

1518
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,450
And so I'd see the
billboard at the Hyatt now,

1519
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:02,220
the Andaz looking over the comedy store.

1520
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:04,380
I remember saying Ladell couture too,

1521
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:05,214
I think.

1522
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,390
And people are like,

1523
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,571
oh,

1524
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:07,111
it's a fight.

1525
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:07,410
I'm like,

1526
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:07,591
oh,

1527
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:08,131
what does that mean?

1528
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:09,060
Who are those guys?

1529
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,380
And having Taten you go like,

1530
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:10,530
Yo,

1531
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,030
they actually fought an epic fight or two,

1532
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:12,601
it might have been three,

1533
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:13,434
I'm not sure.

1534
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,270
Um,

1535
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,420
and now they're going to have a rematch.

1536
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:15,600
I'm like,

1537
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,440
oh cool.

1538
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,210
I didn't really know anything about it.

1539
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:21,510
I remember rolling at the old bomb
squad and having people talk about it.

1540
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:21,721
I'm like,

1541
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,760
what is this thing that you
guys were talking about?

1542
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:25,290
I remember Hoists Gracie,

1543
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,510
but I don't know who any of these people,

1544
00:36:27,511 --> 00:36:28,860
I don't know the terms you're using,

1545
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,440
get them on the ground and like it's all,

1546
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:34,540
it's all a question of
matchups mattress makes more,

1547
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,523
oh,

1548
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,590
I'm just like trying to get a half garden.

1549
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,360
Trying to figure out how to do that.

1550
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,090
A rear naked choke defense got good fast.

1551
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,260
Do you got pretty good?

1552
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,580
You got pretty good.

1553
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:45,960
I remember you tapping people.

1554
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,240
I remember looking over and
watching you tap some guys going,

1555
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:49,051
damn,

1556
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:49,884
it was fun.

1557
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,350
Fucking Jujitsu if you brought,

1558
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:52,980
if bodies didn't break,

1559
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,080
I'm doing Jujitsu.

1560
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,640
It'd be the most fun thing to do.

1561
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,990
If bodies were way more durable,

1562
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,000
like next didn't give out.

1563
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,010
Like Eddie's had three surgeries
inside of the last year.

1564
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,210
He had knee surgery,

1565
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,740
he had his back disc replaced in his back
and then he just had shoulder surgery.

1566
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,410
It's like your body just gets blown apart.

1567
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,610
When I tore my meniscus,

1568
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,500
I had surgery on it.

1569
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:17,161
They didn't know what it was.

1570
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:17,994
For the longest time.

1571
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,450
Your Buddy,

1572
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,410
Dr Steve.

1573
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:20,490
Steve Graham,

1574
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:20,641
yeah.

1575
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:21,090
He was like,

1576
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,750
Oh uh,

1577
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,730
Mris get false negatives 20% of the time.

1578
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,070
Just tell them to scope
it cause I was like,

1579
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,300
it's showing nothing goes.

1580
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:27,840
It's probably,

1581
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,411
it's probably that,

1582
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:29,160
just tell them to scope it.

1583
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,090
They went in there and found it,

1584
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,343
did it right then.

1585
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:31,991
But,

1586
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:32,824
um,

1587
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:33,841
when they did it,

1588
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:34,380
I was like,

1589
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:34,891
there were like,

1590
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:35,724
um,

1591
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,390
uh,

1592
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,931
what do you do?

1593
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:37,770
What might hurt it?

1594
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:39,090
And I was showing her Jitsu high guard,

1595
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,350
just like on the table of myself.

1596
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,580
And he was like,

1597
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,260
that's what pulling my leg back like that,

1598
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:43,980
you know?

1599
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,311
And he's like,

1600
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:44,551
what,

1601
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:45,540
why don't do that.

1602
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,200
And I was like,

1603
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,150
oh that's I have to do as part of it.

1604
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:48,930
Like it was,

1605
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,250
why would you bend your leg like that?

1606
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,260
Like that's everyday man,

1607
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,940
that's twice a week.

1608
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,290
They don't know what the
fuck they're talking about.

1609
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:56,700
That's just a flexibility issue.

1610
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,673
Yeah.

1611
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,220
That never bothered my knees.

1612
00:37:59,520 --> 00:37:59,970
Really?

1613
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:00,490
No,

1614
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:00,751
no.

1615
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:01,411
If you're flexible,

1616
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:02,340
that's most kettlebells.

1617
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,290
More than chits that yeah,

1618
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,650
cause I remember we were doing some stuff
like you were doing cleans and presses

1619
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:08,130
and I was like,

1620
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:08,963
Ooh,

1621
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,100
for guide doesn't ever lift weights.

1622
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,900
This is a pretty explosive movement.

1623
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,160
Yeah.

1624
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,430
And my technique's not perfect.

1625
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:17,660
So then it's like really opening
it up to like more very much.

1626
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,050
And it's also when,

1627
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,330
when you get sore from
doing something like that,

1628
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:23,010
you really should take a long time off.

1629
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:26,070
Like the real hard thing for people that
are just starting to lift weights is

1630
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:27,330
the building process.

1631
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,360
It's like one of the things that we had
talked about with this fitness challenge

1632
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:35,361
was lifting the most amount of weights
and in improving your Max weight over the

1633
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:35,501
month.

1634
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:35,741
I was like,

1635
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:36,040
okay

1636
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,460
guys,

1637
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,090
let's be,

1638
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,860
let's slow down here because you guys,

1639
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,870
I mean I know Tom Lifts weights a little.

1640
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,490
You don't lift weights at all?

1641
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,061
No,

1642
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:43,930
I do not.

1643
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,790
I lift weights a lot and I'm like,

1644
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,181
listen,

1645
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:49,380
if I'm going to improve
my macs and things were,

1646
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:51,790
were running the risk
of catastrophic injury,

1647
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,490
like we're running the
risk of tearing ligaments.

1648
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,810
Also be bad for the contest.

1649
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:57,010
How somebody you have to drop out.

1650
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,550
Yeah,

1651
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,710
it could fuck you up pretty bad.

1652
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,570
I don't lift Max weight.

1653
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:06,760
I lift like considerably less than my
max weight and I don't go to failure.

1654
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,540
I do this.

1655
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,260
You don't go to failure?

1656
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:08,740
No.

1657
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,140
I operate under these principles of uh,

1658
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,520
this Guy Pavel Tatsu lean who came up
with this company called strong first.

1659
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,200
And what the idea is,

1660
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,670
is you do less.

1661
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,730
Like say if I can do 70 pound kettle
bell and I can press it over my head 15

1662
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:24,460
times.

1663
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,570
I don't do 15 times.

1664
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,470
I do six,

1665
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:31,620
five or six and then I put it down and
I leave it alone for like 10 minutes and

1666
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:37,651
then a comeback and I do another five
and I do low repetitions and unless I'm

1667
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:39,640
doing conditioning,

1668
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,390
in which case I'll use a much
lighter weight and I'll do weight.

1669
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:43,751
Yeah.

1670
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:46,420
But Cam does different shit
cause like 40 reps of fun.

1671
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,890
He does a bunch of ridiculous shit.

1672
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,270
He's a fucking maniac.

1673
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:51,830
You can't pay attention to him because
he doesn't make sense outside the norm.

1674
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:52,240
He's,

1675
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,680
he doesn't make any sense.

1676
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,850
He doesn't get injured.

1677
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,680
He fucking runs marathons every day
and he'll do hundreds of repetitions.

1678
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,100
I killed two sets of 25
like four sets of 25 yeah.

1679
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,470
He like when he's preparing
for one of those big races,

1680
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,540
he runs a marathon a day.

1681
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,440
Jesus.

1682
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:08,681
Yeah.

1683
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:09,670
It doesn't make any sense,

1684
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:14,560
but also you have to recognize that
he built himself into that state over

1685
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:15,394
decades.

1686
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,290
Do you know marathon where it comes from?

1687
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:18,581
Yeah.

1688
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:22,750
It was a distance that they had to
run to alert someone of something.

1689
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:23,260
Right.

1690
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,071
I did know the guy,

1691
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:25,180
I guess his name was marathon,

1692
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,350
the right afterwards,

1693
00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:28,000
afterwards and died.

1694
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,770
But it was more than an actual marathon.

1695
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:30,171
I don't think it,

1696
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:30,280
uh,

1697
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,411
it was,

1698
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:31,390
it was 26.2,

1699
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:32,470
I think it was a hundred miles.

1700
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,520
I think you've got rid in a hundred.

1701
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,563
See if that's true.

1702
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,700
The origin of the term marathon,

1703
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,570
we call that up.

1704
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,520
Origin of marathon please.

1705
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,393
Thank you.

1706
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:39,880
Yeah.

1707
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,713
Pull that shit up.

1708
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,353
Um,

1709
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,560
so,

1710
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,220
uh,

1711
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,210
Cam doesn't count.

1712
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:46,900
Yeah.

1713
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,670
I don't understand how
he's not always hurt,

1714
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,311
but anyways,

1715
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:51,144
who did less?

1716
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:52,721
Oh,

1717
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:54,190
it's 25 miles.

1718
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,243
Huh?

1719
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,860
So it is announcing the fucking
adopt to the defeat of the Persians.

1720
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:01,480
He was just announcing a sports score.

1721
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,170
Wow.

1722
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,003
It wasn't alerting them.

1723
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,540
Say That guy's name.

1724
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,201
Try to say his name.

1725
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:06,760
The soldier fit.

1726
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:07,290
Dip,

1727
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,680
fitted,

1728
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:08,971
fit,

1729
00:41:08,971 --> 00:41:09,221
dip.

1730
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:10,590
Idis fit.

1731
00:41:10,591 --> 00:41:11,424
Dip.

1732
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,090
Pet is that it is the deputies.

1733
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:13,680
Sure.

1734
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,513
Sure.

1735
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,510
I'll do what you want me to hear.

1736
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:19,690
The buzz on the first marathon
commemorated the run of
soldier for deputies from

1737
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:24,691
a battlefield near the town of
marathon grease to areas in for 90 BC.

1738
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:29,680
According to Legend for deputies ran the
approximately 25 miles to announce the

1739
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:32,530
defeat of the Persians to
some anxious Athenians.

1740
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,340
But doesn't say that the guy died.

1741
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,211
No,

1742
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:37,220
it does not say died.

1743
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,450
See how that guy's running?

1744
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,313
Look up.

1745
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,560
See where the guys striking with his heel.

1746
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,280
It's wrong.

1747
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,090
Totally wrong.

1748
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:44,871
Not only is it wrong,

1749
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:46,640
human beings never ran like that before.

1750
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:48,530
They invented those stupid fucking shoes.

1751
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,580
I tried it.

1752
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,860
I heard you say that before when
you're talking about the gold shoes.

1753
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,170
So I try to like lead with my,

1754
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,590
with yeah,

1755
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,870
not so what is it you,

1756
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,381
your Paul,

1757
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:57,890
your phone.

1758
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,280
Yeah.

1759
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,530
That's what you're supposed
to lean forward more.

1760
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,000
And when you lean forward more,

1761
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:05,480
you strike down and you almost
hit with your foot flat.

1762
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,290
But what you never want to do is
run like that asshole heel down.

1763
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,030
That's how people destroy
their knees running.

1764
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,620
And that was all created by Nike.

1765
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,190
Nike created that stupid
bubble fat heel shoe.

1766
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,211
Because you know,

1767
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:18,380
to give you more cushioning,

1768
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,810
but it's just the mechanics
of it are totally wrong.

1769
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,040
If you ever watch little kids run,

1770
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,720
they're run ball of the foot first.

1771
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,410
That's natural.

1772
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,030
That's how you're
supposed to naturally run.

1773
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,910
That's your foot is literally
designed as a shock absorber.

1774
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,920
I run with those minimalist shoes.

1775
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,960
My shoes have zero cushioning,

1776
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:33,823
zero,

1777
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,140
so I'm running mountains and
hills and shit like that.

1778
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:37,970
Even when I hunted elk last week,

1779
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,290
see these guys?

1780
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:39,830
Oh yeah,

1781
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:40,760
right on the ball.

1782
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,680
Yeah,

1783
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,281
the black ones,

1784
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:44,720
the real dark black ones who are good,

1785
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,950
they run barefoot,

1786
00:42:45,951 --> 00:42:46,790
those fucking guys.

1787
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,840
But these guys are,

1788
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,100
they're landing flat.

1789
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,320
They Dev a lot of cushioning on the shoes.

1790
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:53,720
You have to realize like it and
some of these guys are landing heel,

1791
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,920
that kind of the back of the heel first
and that's because those God damn shoes,

1792
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,330
if you didn't have shoes like that,

1793
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:02,300
there's no fucking way that guys all,

1794
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:03,890
he'll see that last guy.

1795
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,050
That guy's all heal.

1796
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,290
You would never run like that.

1797
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,600
It's against the mechanics
of the human knee.

1798
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:09,141
Hold it.

1799
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:09,741
Go back to that.

1800
00:43:09,741 --> 00:43:11,090
What does that video that does come up?

1801
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,103
It's the elite.

1802
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,330
What was that video that
was just coming up next?

1803
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:14,871
Not to come up?

1804
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:18,200
Neck said Candace running cadence.

1805
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:18,531
Oh,

1806
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:19,070
cadence.

1807
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:19,820
Okay.

1808
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,630
Um,

1809
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,050
that,

1810
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,220
that video,

1811
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:26,330
like that's the only reason that
people are running like that.

1812
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,800
It's because of the
invention of those shoes.

1813
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:28,521
I mean you,

1814
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:29,570
you run quite a bit,

1815
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:30,160
right?

1816
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,993
I've seen,

1817
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,560
the reason I look for that it's because
I've seen a video from the Olympics,

1818
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:36,680
I think it was last year where they
showing long distance runners and all of

1819
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:40,910
them had a different stride somewhere
running ball foot or first summer running.

1820
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:43,820
He'll first the winter it was different.

1821
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,860
I mean I was also goes to all
their bodies are different.

1822
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:46,440
They have different,

1823
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:46,621
well,

1824
00:43:46,621 --> 00:43:47,431
you can run,

1825
00:43:47,431 --> 00:43:50,370
he'll first with those shoes and you
can get away with it for a long time.

1826
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:50,581
The,

1827
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:50,840
the,

1828
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,300
the issue is that's not the way your
body's designed and the only reason why

1829
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:56,250
people are running like that's
cause those fucking shoes,

1830
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:57,331
you know?

1831
00:43:57,331 --> 00:43:57,870
Um,

1832
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:02,760
if you talk to physiologists and people
study anatomy and the loads and the

1833
00:44:02,761 --> 00:44:03,430
human nature,

1834
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:05,600
there's massive loads.

1835
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,370
There's massive problems with running.

1836
00:44:08,371 --> 00:44:09,990
He'll first just not,

1837
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:10,291
you're,

1838
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,011
you're not designed,

1839
00:44:11,011 --> 00:44:11,450
right.

1840
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:11,740
Uh,

1841
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,481
I would say though,

1842
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:13,350
just as a disclaimer,

1843
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,870
the biggest problem for most people
who were probably those doors,

1844
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,740
you don't run it all.

1845
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,071
Yeah.

1846
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:17,371
That too.

1847
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:20,610
So go ahead and get up to fucking ass
and run and then figure out the exact

1848
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:21,331
right technique later.

1849
00:44:21,331 --> 00:44:24,060
I remember when we trying to convince
Bert that running on a treadmill is not

1850
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,290
the same as running and he was like,

1851
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:25,771
no way.

1852
00:44:25,771 --> 00:44:26,760
And they try real running.

1853
00:44:26,761 --> 00:44:27,040
He was like,

1854
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,530
no swollen charter dude.

1855
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:29,880
It is so much harder.

1856
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,220
Of course the fucking coming towards you.

1857
00:44:32,221 --> 00:44:33,510
All you have to do is pick your legs up.

1858
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:33,901
But you know,

1859
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:35,460
it's way like for me anyway,

1860
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:40,020
that I've noticed while running on actual
ground versus burst pavement ground is

1861
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:41,890
ways here oh ways on my joints.

1862
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,080
So I can go longer.

1863
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:43,280
It,

1864
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,430
it's a Gig or something.

1865
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,330
It's like putting our core,

1866
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:46,410
but you're,

1867
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:47,760
you can run and pavement,

1868
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:48,340
no problem.

1869
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,540
As long as you run up hill.

1870
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,120
Oh really?

1871
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,250
Yeah.

1872
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:50,890
Cause then it's,

1873
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:51,723
then it's toto.

1874
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,040
Well it's not just that,

1875
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,520
it's you just know pounding when
you're running up hill because you're

1876
00:44:56,521 --> 00:44:57,600
decelerating.

1877
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:59,970
As you catch yourself
and you're pushing off.

1878
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:01,260
It's like you're doing lunges.

1879
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,020
The problem is not with pat is unless
you're running in a Dali painting,

1880
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,050
then it's fucking impossible
to keep running up hill.

1881
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,621
It's good point.

1882
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,030
Good reference to painting.

1883
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,800
I will not matter how many,

1884
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:12,960
how many Dolly Robinson's
you have in this MMA podcast?

1885
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,030
Zero cause the first one ever.

1886
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:19,230
I Walk Downhill basically
and then run uphill.

1887
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:19,790
Oh really?

1888
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:20,440
I kind of,

1889
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:20,820
I,

1890
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,350
I mean I go way slower.

1891
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:22,861
Downhill.

1892
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:23,850
It's just dangerous.

1893
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,170
It's bad for your joints.

1894
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,360
Pound like going downhill,

1895
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,530
like deceleration,

1896
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:31,590
like running downhill and
catching yourself like that.

1897
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:32,430
It's just not good.

1898
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,260
But the deceleration only when you,

1899
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,940
it's not even deceleration really,

1900
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:39,720
but when you run up hill there's
no pounding because you're,

1901
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,780
you're just reaching that
area and then pushing.

1902
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,070
But it wears you out more.

1903
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:45,210
But like your muscles.

1904
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:45,751
But you're right,

1905
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:46,210
the Jordan's.

1906
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:46,441
Okay.

1907
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:47,380
We were hiking the Alps.

1908
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:48,300
This here in July

1909
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,930
and man there's uphills with
like really have to push,

1910
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:53,820
but the downhills like you're pushing off.

1911
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,240
Yeah,

1912
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,710
and it's like it just hurts more.

1913
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,580
It hurts or quads beats up your
knees to really beats up your knees.

1914
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,680
I've found that a elk hunting too,

1915
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:04,320
but the really the painful
stuff was the downhill.

1916
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,000
You're just stopping yourself,

1917
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:06,811
stopping yourself,

1918
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:09,780
stopping herself and then
there's also a lot of sliding,

1919
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:13,080
almost like got to push a foot
sideways to like go in that way.

1920
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:13,890
It's almost easier.

1921
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:14,221
Yeah.

1922
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:15,900
That's why they have such stiff shoes.

1923
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,970
When those you don't like shoes,

1924
00:46:17,971 --> 00:46:18,930
you don't come over the edge,

1925
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,720
get an edge and you can dig
that edge into the ground.

1926
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,360
I got some good luck boots for
that and it was like really good.

1927
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:25,620
It makes a big difference.

1928
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:27,780
I tried hiking with these minimal issues.

1929
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,100
This last trip that I was on,

1930
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,060
I didn't like him.

1931
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:31,350
I wasn't a fan.

1932
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,011
They're,

1933
00:46:32,011 --> 00:46:34,200
they're fine for running
if I'm running on a trail.

1934
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:37,350
But for hiking like
the human body is just,

1935
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,550
we have bitch ass bodies
a week with boots.

1936
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:44,370
You want to be able to walk into a
creek without having to worry about like

1937
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:45,121
there's going to soak my shoes,

1938
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:46,260
socks to the next four hours.

1939
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:46,830
Yup.

1940
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,460
Yeah,

1941
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:47,670
yeah.

1942
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,430
Gortex he wanted that Goretex
lining of your boots by the way.

1943
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:51,420
So after that fight,

1944
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,440
um,

1945
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,010
after that,

1946
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:53,910
me and Dunkin Kissing,

1947
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:54,450
yeah.

1948
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:54,641
Uh,

1949
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:56,970
there was a blog that went
up pretty fast that said,

1950
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:57,180
uh,

1951
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,040
two board bearded dudes get rough sea.

1952
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:01,351
And,

1953
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,184
uh,

1954
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,590
I got a text from a guy
just got a new phone,

1955
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,390
a new flippy and uh,

1956
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:06,811
somebody,

1957
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:07,650
I didn't know who it was.

1958
00:47:07,651 --> 00:47:08,730
Somebody texted me like,

1959
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:09,211
Oh,

1960
00:47:09,211 --> 00:47:12,220
you two are quite the social media
darlings last night were do that.

1961
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,530
I hadn't responded to how it was.

1962
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,030
And then,

1963
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:14,863
um,

1964
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,870
later I looked through my,

1965
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:18,110
I messages through Dana and I was like,

1966
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,720
was not mad.

1967
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,181
I don't think he does,

1968
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:22,200
but you never quite know.

1969
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:22,681
I know,

1970
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:22,861
right?

1971
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:23,281
Cause you're like,

1972
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:24,420
you are a CEO,

1973
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:24,961
you know,

1974
00:47:24,961 --> 00:47:28,020
in addition to being this cool fucking
regular dude who curses all the time,

1975
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,950
you're also a c e o

1976
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,910
which is like the WHO I don't normally
get along with the gigantic sports

1977
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,043
organization.

1978
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,093
Yeah.

1979
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:36,993
That guy.

1980
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,050
It's interesting meeting that guy to
having like dinners with them and like

1981
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:44,680
converse it casual conversation to listen
to like a highly successful person and

1982
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:48,160
just how they like normally
act once he dropped the guard,

1983
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,023
you know.

1984
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,073
Um,

1985
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,250
it's just interesting.

1986
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:51,610
He's like,

1987
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,690
yeah dude.

1988
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,340
For sure.

1989
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:53,820
Driven.

1990
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,330
Yeah.

1991
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:54,651
He,

1992
00:47:54,651 --> 00:47:56,820
he loves making deals and all the,

1993
00:47:56,821 --> 00:47:58,290
all the ships involved in it.

1994
00:47:58,860 --> 00:47:59,693
But um,

1995
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,060
hearing you guys talk about like the
fucking meet heads of Boston fighting and

1996
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:06,340
stuff like the top two
meatheads finally met.

1997
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,190
I remember the story he
told was it was like Whoa,

1998
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:12,480
Boston where Burt Dana came
up and where I came up,

1999
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:14,370
the sparring was awful.

2000
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,181
It was,

2001
00:48:15,181 --> 00:48:15,690
uh,

2002
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:16,171
he,

2003
00:48:16,171 --> 00:48:19,340
he sparked a lot in south Boston and um,

2004
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:19,661
I,

2005
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:24,340
I sparked in Summerville and a in revere
and a couple of these other places.

2006
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:27,360
It was everybody would beat
the shit out of each other.

2007
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,890
There was no real sparring and one RN.

2008
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,940
Rivera Rivera Rivera.

2009
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:33,571
Yeah,

2010
00:48:33,571 --> 00:48:33,960
they,

2011
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,711
there was no,

2012
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:35,220
uh,

2013
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,720
you're supposed to spar.

2014
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:37,770
Wow.

2015
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,030
This is a lot of debate on this,

2016
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:43,950
but most people think you should
spar at like 60 to 70% maximum.

2017
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,420
Everybody's part 100% or they just fought.

2018
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,433
Everybody fought.

2019
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,120
Everybody got brain damage.

2020
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:52,163
100%

2021
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,880
that's my boss is how it is a Harvard or
you're a Dork and the women aren't the

2022
00:48:57,881 --> 00:48:58,610
best looking.

2023
00:48:58,610 --> 00:48:59,443
If there was one

2024
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,313
stage,

2025
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,160
you're challenging me and we sat down.

2026
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,700
It's like one of these
things that comics do.

2027
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:07,481
What do they say?

2028
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:08,920
Something like real dark,

2029
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:10,210
just your comic friends and they're like,

2030
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:11,090
you should do that on stage.

2031
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,670
It's like this challenge of like,

2032
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,370
oh right you are.

2033
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:14,840
He goes on

2034
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,050
stage at the comedy connection
in Faneuil Hall and he will,

2035
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,850
I don't remember the exact wording of it,

2036
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:21,490
but you were like a,

2037
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:21,771
you know,

2038
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:24,960
the problem with Boston is women are
just really not that good looking.

2039
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:25,670
This is,

2040
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:26,580
and people like,

2041
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:34,030
I love that training it to now I
can go after a crowd and just like,

2042
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,130
you can go with maybe you want,

2043
00:49:35,131 --> 00:49:35,964
I'm being honest,

2044
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:37,020
you know,

2045
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:37,621
training.

2046
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:38,120
Yeah.

2047
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:38,520
Yeah.

2048
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,740
The way that you can see that in like a,

2049
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,730
in like a cat Williams when he's shitting
on Michael Jackson when he was still a

2050
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,320
hero and it was like boom.

2051
00:49:46,321 --> 00:49:46,561
He goes,

2052
00:49:46,561 --> 00:49:48,670
fuck you children fescue.

2053
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:49,650
He's a molester.

2054
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,753
Yeah.

2055
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:51,810
That go right at them.

2056
00:49:51,811 --> 00:49:53,100
I don't care how you feel.

2057
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:53,811
Well,

2058
00:49:53,811 --> 00:49:54,810
I'm justified in this.

2059
00:49:54,811 --> 00:49:56,310
Super justified with that.

2060
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:56,640
Yeah.

2061
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,590
I mean that was just some xy.

2062
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,150
Boston women are disgusting.

2063
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,470
Even if they're good looking,

2064
00:50:01,471 --> 00:50:02,670
they're voices are garbage.

2065
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:08,960
Oh fuck me and my pussy fucking Quia.

2066
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,073
Um,

2067
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,300
those were fun times too,

2068
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:13,491
man,

2069
00:50:13,491 --> 00:50:16,000
because when we first started
going on the road together,

2070
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,700
like one of the more fun things was,

2071
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,040
well,

2072
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,260
you was really fun hanging
out and doing shows,

2073
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,850
but it was also fun saying like,

2074
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:26,080
you can't get fired.

2075
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:26,850
Kicked out.

2076
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:27,170
Did,

2077
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,190
was such an influential

2078
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:28,461
time.

2079
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:31,130
I stand up that specifically
where it was like,

2080
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:34,700
we're at the hotel five minute walk
from Faneuil hall and you're like,

2081
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:35,534
let's get high.

2082
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:36,111
And I was like,

2083
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:36,311
Nah,

2084
00:50:36,311 --> 00:50:39,590
I'm about four months crazy
kick at high right now.

2085
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,660
That's what I had been
high 20 times maybe.

2086
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,543
And you're like,

2087
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,300
why?

2088
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:44,541
I'm like,

2089
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,380
because I won't do good.

2090
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:45,980
He goes,

2091
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,060
so I'm like,

2092
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:47,421
what do you mean?

2093
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:48,254
So he goes,

2094
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,093
so,

2095
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,570
but then he goes,

2096
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:51,290
you won't get fired.

2097
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,160
They didn't hire you.

2098
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:53,181
You can't play here.

2099
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:54,170
It's 450 seats.

2100
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:57,980
And also like it because it's too far
for you to go to feature and you just way

2101
00:50:57,981 --> 00:50:58,970
too big for you to headline.

2102
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,750
So I'm hiring you and I don't
care if you get too fucked up.

2103
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,190
So smoked pot.

2104
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:04,840
And I was like,

2105
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,673
yeah,

2106
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,630
why don't you to feel free?

2107
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:12,631
And that there's these moments when
you get high and you go on stage where,

2108
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:13,960
and they don't always happen,

2109
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:19,110
but there are moments where you take a
right turn into brilliant Ville and that

2110
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:22,210
right turn doesn't exist.

2111
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:23,530
Sometimes if you're sober,

2112
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,191
you're sober,

2113
00:51:24,191 --> 00:51:25,210
you'll stick to the script.

2114
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,380
But if you're high,

2115
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:27,250
you're like,

2116
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,260
so what if I did fuck my dog?

2117
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,953
Let's try,

2118
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,023
let's try this for a while.

2119
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:37,230
How to know where you might come up with
this premise or this tagline or this

2120
00:51:37,271 --> 00:51:40,330
thing that comes from you being in
this altered state of conscious.

2121
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:40,610
Yes.

2122
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:41,510
And you can't do it.

2123
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:42,680
Any comic listening,

2124
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,260
I would not advise you
doing it on a big showcase.

2125
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:48,200
We have to show like William Marsh and
Mclennan or when you're taping something

2126
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:49,010
where it's important,

2127
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,610
but for workout sets when you're really
just trying to get work out of this.

2128
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,893
So,

2129
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:54,441
so,

2130
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:55,190
um,

2131
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:56,510
and back then I could get hot.

2132
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:57,261
Now you and I,

2133
00:51:57,261 --> 00:51:58,910
we get high for a couple hours,

2134
00:51:59,210 --> 00:51:59,540
you know,

2135
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,820
maybe then I was high for nine hours.

2136
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,740
I smoked three hits.

2137
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:04,574
There was no like,

2138
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,360
so anyway,

2139
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,460
we had two sets at night or
Friday or Saturday night.

2140
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:08,683
And uh,

2141
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,000
the first set was awful.

2142
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:11,470
I,

2143
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:13,130
I forgot what I was saying.

2144
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,350
I had no idea where I was going.

2145
00:52:15,351 --> 00:52:15,690
I remember,

2146
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:16,523
isn't that bad?

2147
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,450
I was bad.

2148
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:17,581
No,

2149
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:17,661
no,

2150
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:17,781
no.

2151
00:52:17,781 --> 00:52:19,220
Parts of it were really far to have it.

2152
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:19,700
Okay.

2153
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,090
But then by the second set now,

2154
00:52:21,091 --> 00:52:22,160
then you went on for an hour,

2155
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,130
then we had a half hour break and then
want to again by then I come down a

2156
00:52:25,131 --> 00:52:25,581
little bit.

2157
00:52:25,581 --> 00:52:27,440
And the second set was what
you were talking about.

2158
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:29,450
Free flowing.

2159
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,720
Get high about an hour and a
half before you go onstage.

2160
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,650
Not like right before I fucked
up and got a high right before.

2161
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:37,460
That's not,

2162
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,300
that's not wise.

2163
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,141
What's wise,

2164
00:52:39,141 --> 00:52:39,580
isn't it

2165
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,390
on your way down.

2166
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,390
You already know where it's
gone and now you're coasting.

2167
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,350
You know what Edgar would do
medic or we're due for a while.

2168
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:47,800
He would go on late at the comedy store
and he wouldn't get high off that.

2169
00:52:47,801 --> 00:52:47,921
You know,

2170
00:52:47,921 --> 00:52:49,930
your first hit of the day
is like your biggest one.

2171
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:51,183
And um,

2172
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,450
cigarette smokers have the suits.

2173
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,271
Only time you get a buzz,

2174
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:55,130
that first cigarette you know it,

2175
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,800
but your first we'd hit,

2176
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:57,663
it's the biggest one.

2177
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,170
He wouldn't smoke all day.

2178
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,000
He'd have a 12:15 AM spot.

2179
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:02,080
And when they go,

2180
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:02,501
Hey Matt,

2181
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:03,400
we're letting the Tony,

2182
00:53:03,401 --> 00:53:03,701
he'd go,

2183
00:53:03,701 --> 00:53:04,240
cool,

2184
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,073
run to the main room,

2185
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,070
smoke a bunch.

2186
00:53:06,071 --> 00:53:08,440
And that three minutes
and then go on stage.

2187
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,900
Ooh.

2188
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,160
Yeah,

2189
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,770
and he'd be going up and
feeling it while he's off.

2190
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,690
Like it wouldn't even hit him
until he's two minutes on.

2191
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,553
Oh Jesus.

2192
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,240
He did that for like six months.

2193
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,270
Be Good if you had notes.

2194
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,850
Yeah.

2195
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:21,540
And if you followed what
you talked about already.

2196
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,750
That's what I tell them when they play
Clandestina or comedy underground,

2197
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:25,710
they call and Toronto.

2198
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:26,010
Wow.

2199
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,060
That place is crazy.

2200
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:28,230
I'm like,

2201
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,681
any advice?

2202
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:28,920
I'm like,

2203
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,450
my advice is bring a set list.

2204
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,860
I normally don't say that,

2205
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:34,410
but this is one you will lose your place.

2206
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:36,630
There was no air in that room.

2207
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:41,631
Once green is only pot like you
were breathing pot and exhaling pot.

2208
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,810
It was all pot.

2209
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,040
My Buddy Minola so he was like,

2210
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:44,611
I don't smoke.

2211
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:46,230
And then he's in the back for 20 minutes.

2212
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:47,160
Like two of them high shit.

2213
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:47,720
Yes.

2214
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,540
Tripoli.

2215
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,350
Tripoli wasn't getting high back
then and yes you are standing.

2216
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,210
He was barbecued.

2217
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,550
That's where I started to believe
secondhand smoke is a real thing.

2218
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:59,010
I didn't think it was until then.

2219
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,190
People that don't think it's real,

2220
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,481
it's great.

2221
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:01,990
When we used to mock tape cause take,

2222
00:54:01,991 --> 00:54:04,470
didn't want to get high and we would just
smoke pot and Tate would have to stick

2223
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:05,970
his head out the window like an ostrich.

2224
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,430
I feel like what the
fuck is wrong with her?

2225
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:12,210
He was worried and you want
to get hotboxing if that's
when we used to get vans.

2226
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,830
Remember we used to get vans for awhile?

2227
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,150
Conversion vans.

2228
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:15,360
Yeah.

2229
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,400
We would rent vans because
it was so many of us.

2230
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:19,063
Oh

2231
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:20,820
yeah.

2232
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,970
We would entourage it and
red van would film it.

2233
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:26,490
We would just have shenanigans
and every time we went to

2234
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:28,890
you of course.

2235
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:33,930
And then Eddie Tate and red band as the
non comedians and then me and Duncan or

2236
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:35,940
me and dia or whatever.

2237
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:37,160
Um,

2238
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,310
there was a shitload of us.

2239
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:38,641
Yeah.

2240
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:39,121
So five,

2241
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:41,370
six people and then we would feast.

2242
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,800
We'd go to these fucking
amazing restaurants.

2243
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:44,910
Fogo a lot.

2244
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,350
We went to a lot of photos.

2245
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:47,700
It brings me back to one of my memories,

2246
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,730
I believe it was Cincinnati was nearby.

2247
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,840
Right near the hotel.

2248
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,670
Do you want us to Korea?

2249
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:54,150
Yeah,

2250
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:55,020
right across the street.

2251
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:55,590
Yeah.

2252
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:59,490
And a as relieving fucking newly a botox.

2253
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:00,363
Uh,

2254
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:01,500
I came in and like,

2255
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:01,681
dude,

2256
00:55:01,681 --> 00:55:03,840
that's fucking Vandelay and he was,

2257
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:07,520
he was the most fierce pregame fighter.

2258
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:08,430
The way he'd look at you like,

2259
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,960
I want to kill you for taking this flight.

2260
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:13,860
Nobody was scary that him and his prime
cro cop was scary because he would just

2261
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:14,820
be so calm.

2262
00:55:14,821 --> 00:55:19,160
Like I don't care what do this cop stared
him down more than anybody ever stared

2263
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,003
Vandelay town.

2264
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:20,780
He wouldn't break,

2265
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,181
it could move.

2266
00:55:21,181 --> 00:55:22,740
Cro Cop was a straight up killer,

2267
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,210
Croatian Croatian antiterrorist squad.

2268
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,260
They begged for mercy and I've showed
them and he's a world class kickboxer like

2269
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:34,890
he wasn't afraid of Vandelay strike and
he was a heavyweight and Vandelay really

2270
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:35,724
wasn't a heavyweight.

2271
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,350
But anyway,

2272
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:38,820
we saw him checking in and we went to eat.

2273
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,610
He was in that true husker
Rhea 15 minutes late.

2274
00:55:41,611 --> 00:55:43,350
Like he threw his shit down and came in.

2275
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,080
They were like so excited about it.

2276
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,301
Look,

2277
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:46,134
look at Cro cop.

2278
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,063
Wow

2279
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,733
Dude.

2280
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,300
Nobody's stared down.

2281
00:55:51,301 --> 00:55:52,260
Cro Cop back then,

2282
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,990
that was when cro cop was at the peak was
Japanese got going through his routine

2283
00:55:55,991 --> 00:55:56,824
and it's like fuck.

2284
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,160
And I'm pretty sure this was before,

2285
00:55:59,220 --> 00:55:59,670
uh,

2286
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:02,880
Cro cop really had sort of mastered MMA.

2287
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,180
He was coming over as a straight kickboxer
and they had different rules for him.

2288
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,350
The rules for Cro cop where like you
can only fight on the ground for like 30

2289
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:14,250
seconds they had and if the fight
went to a distance it would be a draw.

2290
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:15,330
Yeah,

2291
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:20,330
because he really didn't have a lot of
experience with take down defense or any

2292
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:21,810
MMA fighting back then.

2293
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,070
And the,

2294
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:23,950
he didn't get botox.

2295
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:24,040
He

2296
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,140
had his face reconstructed cause his nose,

2297
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,670
he had been in so many brawls,

2298
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:31,270
his nose had completely flattened where
he couldn't breathe out of it and he had

2299
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,900
so much scar tissue over his eyes
that his eyes were drooping down.

2300
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,910
So He'd get cut instantly.

2301
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:37,110
Any,

2302
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:39,760
any punched him would hit him
with open them up like a gas.

2303
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:42,270
And he and his nose was completely flat.

2304
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:47,200
So they took a chunk of his rib and
rebuilt his nose and he had his nose built

2305
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:49,090
big so he could breathe out of it more.

2306
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:53,320
And then he had all the scar tissue
from his eyebrows and then pull back.

2307
00:56:53,321 --> 00:56:54,460
And according to Dana,

2308
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:54,880
I dunno,

2309
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,481
but the is like,

2310
00:56:55,481 --> 00:56:55,721
it got,

2311
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:59,100
it's done in Brazil on the
cheap and it's just like wasn't,

2312
00:56:59,340 --> 00:56:59,860
it didn't,

2313
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,360
I didn't really make
them look like Vander.

2314
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,110
Wow.

2315
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:04,570
So he went from Vandelay Silva.

2316
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,840
It's like Vandelay Silva has the most
profound facial form change in all of MMA

2317
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,510
because he went from pretty,

2318
00:57:13,511 --> 00:57:14,344
if go back,

2319
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:19,430
because I ended up Silva Vandelay Silva
versus go to Vandelay Silva versus Dan

2320
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:21,970
Henderson one.

2321
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,350
When they first fought in pride,

2322
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,010
he,

2323
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,060
he was a normal,

2324
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,560
actually pretty good looking guy,

2325
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,330
like regular good looking guy.

2326
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,430
And then by the time he left pride,

2327
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:32,200
his face was just smashed in.

2328
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,730
By the time he fought chocolate Dell,

2329
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,380
his face was just smashed in.

2330
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:37,600
His nose had been literally flattened.

2331
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,420
Wow.

2332
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,020
For from punches and kicks
and not just from fights,

2333
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:42,250
but also from training.

2334
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:45,580
The training that he did
it shoot to box and karate.

2335
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,150
Ba was legendary.

2336
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,400
It was fucked up.

2337
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:49,234
Fucked up.

2338
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,070
That also okay would
bring me to another thing.

2339
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,570
We got to go to Brazil one time.

2340
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,130
We didn't do a show that time,

2341
00:57:54,131 --> 00:57:58,210
but that's him versus Dan Henderson
can make that a little bigger.

2342
00:57:58,630 --> 00:57:59,260
So you could see.

2343
00:57:59,260 --> 00:57:59,860
Yeah,

2344
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,880
super normal kid.

2345
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,920
Just a normal combat ass.

2346
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:04,600
That was the first fight.

2347
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,660
Oil fought Dan Henderson Chin
look like it was drawn on.

2348
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,010
Guys got him hooked.

2349
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,880
Somebody fucked up.

2350
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:11,000
What?

2351
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,100
He's drawing a bone,

2352
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:16,330
which I let him let him see that picture
of annually above that with the eye all

2353
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:17,080
fucked up.

2354
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,340
That was him from that fight.

2355
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:18,870
Oh really?

2356
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:22,140
And Henderson connected with a haymaker
of her right hand and fucked up his up.

2357
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,440
Smile on that.

2358
00:58:23,441 --> 00:58:24,274
Like look at this bad.

2359
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,700
Look at this cool picture on by the tick.

2360
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,800
But you mean look at vandelays face there
in comparison to his face later on his

2361
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:30,400
career.

2362
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,270
Totally different.

2363
00:58:31,271 --> 00:58:33,880
Dan Henderson looks exactly the same.

2364
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,740
He looks like the same guy.

2365
00:58:35,741 --> 00:58:37,180
He's just an other version.

2366
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:39,400
He might be one of the
toughest guys ever lived.

2367
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,300
So tough.

2368
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:40,991
Yeah.

2369
00:58:40,991 --> 00:58:45,991
Dan is just a fucking picture up there
with the tattoos and the shoulders go to

2370
00:58:46,061 --> 00:58:46,690
that one.

2371
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,970
Now that's him after
facial reconstruction,

2372
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:52,840
make that larger c that's after the
facial reconstruction has settled in,

2373
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:53,890
you know,

2374
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:57,090
or we saw him right then and
he just fought real recently,

2375
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:57,940
a couple of weeks ago.

2376
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,430
He's still fighting gun
knocked out by rampage.

2377
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:01,930
Rampage flatline them.

2378
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:02,630
Wow.

2379
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:03,000
Yeah.

2380
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,250
Pages still fun to Yup.

2381
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,630
Rampage still carries that power.

2382
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:12,631
That was when he KOD rampage Kao to him
in the UFC with and knocking him through

2383
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:16,600
the ring through the pride
was one of the coolest.

2384
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:17,350
Yeah,

2385
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,220
I saw that later.

2386
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:18,461
I mean,

2387
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:18,700
I,

2388
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,001
you know,

2389
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:22,190
way later I come to the UFC and
it's like all these highlights,

2390
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,790
this backlog of highlights of MMA mile,

2391
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,390
especially if the UFC purchase price.

2392
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,393
Yeah.

2393
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,220
Rio was really cool.

2394
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:31,491
Yeah.

2395
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:32,151
It's a place to go.

2396
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:35,570
And actually that fight that in
terms of the audience response,

2397
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:40,730
the two biggest ones were
Sylvia couture in Columbus.

2398
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,200
First time they'd ever been in Columbus.

2399
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,560
And that real fight Josie Aldo versus,

2400
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:45,920
uh,

2401
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,120
that was a Chad Mendez,

2402
00:59:47,121 --> 00:59:47,600
right?

2403
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,433
Which one?

2404
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:49,431
The one in Brazil,

2405
00:59:49,431 --> 00:59:50,150
wasn't it?

2406
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,380
It was a spinning back kick.

2407
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:51,981
Oh,

2408
00:59:51,981 --> 00:59:52,761
that was Terry.

2409
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:56,540
Adam versus a Edson Barboza
dude from day from fight,

2410
00:59:56,541 --> 01:00:00,110
one of the undercard the place was
so that you could feel it shaking.

2411
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,320
And I remember them chanting
something in the crowd.

2412
01:00:03,321 --> 01:00:04,160
Cause Dana did smart.

2413
01:00:04,161 --> 01:00:07,160
There's one of the first like foreign
ones and he made a Brazilian fighter on

2414
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:07,994
every,

2415
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,833
on every fight.

2416
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,530
He fucked up a little by having a couple
of times Brazilian verse Brazilian,

2417
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,500
but at every fight and they were
chanting something in the audience.

2418
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:16,280
Yeah.

2419
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:16,761
You were like,

2420
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:17,600
you go to the translator,

2421
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:19,800
like what are they saying
you're going to die?

2422
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:20,210
It was like,

2423
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:21,320
oh my God.

2424
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:23,660
Oh my God.

2425
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:24,741
Yeah.

2426
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:25,670
They didn't play games,

2427
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:26,000
man.

2428
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,840
Oh my God.

2429
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:27,920
That's when they were like legit.

2430
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:28,551
And I believed it.

2431
01:00:28,551 --> 01:00:30,680
Like we've got to figure out how we're
gonna get Chelsea on and out of here.

2432
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,491
Fights Anderson here.

2433
01:00:31,491 --> 01:00:31,761
And I'm like,

2434
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:32,210
come on.

2435
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:32,781
And then you go there.

2436
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:33,140
You're like,

2437
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:33,261
oh,

2438
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:34,010
I believe it now.

2439
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:34,790
Yeah.

2440
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:34,971
Well,

2441
01:00:34,971 --> 01:00:36,200
they're fiercely,

2442
01:00:36,201 --> 01:00:37,460
fiercely nationalistic.

2443
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,210
And also that's where I'm at.

2444
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,070
Started.

2445
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:40,810
I mean,

2446
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:43,420
MMA martial arts started in the Orient.

2447
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,920
They started in Japan and China and,

2448
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,130
but in terms of like legitimate,

2449
01:00:48,131 --> 01:00:51,010
mixed martial arts valley
to though those no rules,

2450
01:00:51,011 --> 01:00:51,730
fights,

2451
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:52,810
that's all from Brazil.

2452
01:00:52,811 --> 01:00:53,170
Men,

2453
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,420
Brazil changed Jujitsu.

2454
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:56,340
I mean,

2455
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,710
you leave the airport
and they're these giant,

2456
01:00:58,810 --> 01:00:59,640
um,

2457
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,900
like Jujitsu guys in,

2458
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:04,860
he's like looking at each other like
it's part of their organization culture.

2459
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,630
It's huge over there.

2460
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:07,501
And you know,

2461
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:11,490
I had on a Rafael Lovato who's like one
of the top Brazilian Jujitsu fighters in

2462
01:01:11,491 --> 01:01:13,590
the world who fights for Bela Tarr now,

2463
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:16,470
and he's actually an American
from Oklahoma at fights,

2464
01:01:16,471 --> 01:01:17,070
uh,

2465
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:17,371
you know,

2466
01:01:17,371 --> 01:01:19,310
and really represents Brazilian Jujitsu.

2467
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,270
But he was saying that like,

2468
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:23,280
for the longest time,

2469
01:01:23,281 --> 01:01:25,650
the Brazilians dominated
the world championships.

2470
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:28,620
He was one of the first Americans
to win a gold medal in the world

2471
01:01:28,621 --> 01:01:29,454
championships.

2472
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:30,720
But for the longest time,

2473
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:32,030
like even to this shame,

2474
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:36,120
the Brazilian still have a
disproportionate number of gold medalist.

2475
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:37,370
Yup.

2476
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:37,670
Yeah.

2477
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,020
It's huge part of the
culture and they're so proud,

2478
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:40,920
you know,

2479
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,753
so proud.

2480
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:43,230
That was one of the coolest
places I've ever been through.

2481
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,640
I remember also when we went to

2482
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:50,000
Australia to Sydney and uh,

2483
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,990
we did do a show that we did two shows.

2484
01:01:51,991 --> 01:01:52,800
That was cool.

2485
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,633
But um,

2486
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,350
it was in your contract FirstClass
companion ticket way before we were ever

2487
01:01:58,351 --> 01:01:59,700
going to go to Australia for that.

2488
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,740
And then it was just as a UFC grew,

2489
01:02:01,741 --> 01:02:02,910
which is grandfathered in.

2490
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:07,200
And so I remember Dana coming up
to me half joking and half serious,

2491
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:07,920
just going,

2492
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,180
do you know how much
I fucking ticket cost?

2493
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,221
And I'm like,

2494
01:02:11,221 --> 01:02:11,670
what?

2495
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:12,690
$25,000,

2496
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:13,020
dude,

2497
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,580
that's how much I'm paying
for you to go to Australia.

2498
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:17,071
Yeah,

2499
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:18,050
those were good times.

2500
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:19,501
I almost want to like,

2501
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:20,040
Bro,

2502
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,810
put me in coach or give
me fucking 12 of that.

2503
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,710
I could use the money.

2504
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:23,911
I'll split the difference.

2505
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:26,950
Don't suffer for 14 hours for 12 grand.

2506
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:28,363
Yeah,

2507
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:29,120
yeah,

2508
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:29,311
yeah.

2509
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:30,420
Those are like apartments.

2510
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,560
If like a little apartment.

2511
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:32,394
I was so proud.

2512
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:33,773
Yeah,

2513
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:36,450
it's a girl told me he brought him
the year before and he was like,

2514
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:36,661
dude,

2515
01:02:36,661 --> 01:02:37,081
get ready.

2516
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:37,861
It's going to be so good.

2517
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:39,690
They give you socks that I jerked off into

2518
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:43,740
such a fucking cool grand experience.

2519
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:44,131
Yeah,

2520
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:46,150
you can do a lot of fucking UFC live,

2521
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:46,530
man.

2522
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,430
I went to,

2523
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,020
let's just talk about
Anderson for a cause.

2524
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:52,680
I believe my very first
UFC was at the Pearl.

2525
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,311
Yes.

2526
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,050
At the palms.

2527
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:55,470
I think it was Anderson Bearse.

2528
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:56,040
Chris Leeman.

2529
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:56,431
Yes.

2530
01:02:56,431 --> 01:02:57,990
It was fun fight.

2531
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:58,380
Yeah.

2532
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,430
I guess Anderson,

2533
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,810
I might've been his first
fight in the UFC was okay.

2534
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:02,740
And people were like,

2535
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:02,941
yeah,

2536
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:04,530
he's highly touted but not crazy.

2537
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,550
Like he's the best.

2538
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:10,410
Just like I knew who he was and I was
telling everybody like whatever the

2539
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,191
betting line is,

2540
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:12,024
it's off.

2541
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,410
You told me that on um,

2542
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:13,741
on,

2543
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:14,540
um,

2544
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,750
fuck Glover to sharer.

2545
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,080
Oh,

2546
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:16,441
you're like,

2547
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:16,710
hey dude,

2548
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,400
I don't really tell you.

2549
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,810
Go fucking take money on this.

2550
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:19,890
Put all the money.

2551
01:03:19,891 --> 01:03:22,770
He was home early in the
undercard Glover foot.

2552
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:23,640
Kyle Kingsbury,

2553
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:25,800
just like people don't know.

2554
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:26,641
And you know,

2555
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:27,150
Glover,

2556
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:27,391
I was like,

2557
01:03:27,391 --> 01:03:27,751
what's the line?

2558
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:28,020
It goes,

2559
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:28,720
it doesn't matter to her.

2560
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,600
He'll when he got a rough deal man,

2561
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:35,070
because he couldn't get a visa to fight
in the UFC for a loan for six fucking

2562
01:03:35,071 --> 01:03:35,730
years.

2563
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:36,541
For six years.

2564
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:38,970
Glover had a toil and other countries,

2565
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,740
he was one of the best ever.

2566
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,440
He was fucking phenomenal back then man.

2567
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,490
And I think,

2568
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:44,791
you know,

2569
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:47,700
when we got them in the UFC was
at the tail end of his greatness.

2570
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,450
Honestly.

2571
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:52,590
I mean I think we never
really got a chance to see
glow over at his very best in

2572
01:03:52,591 --> 01:03:53,424
the UFC.

2573
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,800
It's kind of like a Jackie Robinson.

2574
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:56,820
Like what were the steps would have
been if he could have played his whole

2575
01:03:56,821 --> 01:03:57,654
career,

2576
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,130
it's euro or something like that.

2577
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:01,140
He's one of those guys that,

2578
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:01,531
I mean,

2579
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:02,400
I remember when he fought,

2580
01:04:02,401 --> 01:04:03,234
so could you,

2581
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:03,871
he fought.

2582
01:04:03,871 --> 01:04:04,441
So could you,

2583
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:09,060
I think it was in the dubby c and the
early days of the WEC when it was in

2584
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:14,061
northern California and he was a chocolate
Dell sparring partner and it was one

2585
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:18,960
of the rare times that he got to fight
in the U S and I remember watching him

2586
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:20,480
fight and I would hear about them.

2587
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:23,520
I think Hackman told me about him too
because he was training with chuck and I

2588
01:04:23,521 --> 01:04:23,731
was like,

2589
01:04:23,731 --> 01:04:25,590
that guy's a mother fucker.

2590
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,150
He is so good.

2591
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,100
He was so solid and he was like,

2592
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:29,371
you know,

2593
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:33,480
training with Hackleman and training
with Chuck Liddell in the early days when

2594
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:34,740
you know they're just savages,

2595
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:35,461
man and his,

2596
01:04:35,461 --> 01:04:36,540
he had wrestling too.

2597
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:38,580
There was one thing that a
lot of Brazilians didn't have.

2598
01:04:38,581 --> 01:04:41,490
They were more Jujitsu oriented
and he was a wrestler as well.

2599
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:42,383
There was Bob Ballou.

2600
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,430
Lou had a real good wrestling base too,

2601
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:47,940
and that was the first guy I remember
making money by leaving the UFC.

2602
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,440
He was one of the straight guys.

2603
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,420
I'll get paid as a UFC vet.

2604
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:55,080
I have a name and I'll get paid a
bunch off this fucking chuck fight,

2605
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:55,830
you know,

2606
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:58,380
I'll get paid a bunch of the rest of my
career until everybody started going.

2607
01:04:58,381 --> 01:04:59,040
And then it's like,

2608
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,550
it wasn't worth that much anymore to
be a form of Europe's force opened up.

2609
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,031
You know,

2610
01:05:03,031 --> 01:05:05,160
a lot of people realize
that there was like,

2611
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,920
there was a legitimate venue
and they weren't showtime.

2612
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:09,720
Strikeforce was on showtime.

2613
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:10,310
Yeah.

2614
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:12,630
You mean when Kimbo fought there?

2615
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,580
I mean it all of a sudden
it was a big fucking deal.

2616
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:17,040
That was a lead XC let the
chick that went on to uh,

2617
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:17,913
to uh,

2618
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,430
Gina Carano and they would like make ms
people and that's actually where you've

2619
01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:22,420
heard about Cyborg.

2620
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:22,930
Yup.

2621
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:23,530
Yup,

2622
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:24,040
Yup.

2623
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:24,341
Yeah.

2624
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:26,560
There was like a lead XC and that.

2625
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:27,843
Yeah.

2626
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,631
And then,

2627
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:29,320
um,

2628
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:29,651
you know,

2629
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:30,401
and strike force,

2630
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:34,840
those were two legit venues outside
the UFC that really kind of,

2631
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:37,480
because the UFC wasn't as big back then.

2632
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:38,020
Right.

2633
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,820
And then they were pretty
legit and there were more men,

2634
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:41,441
you could get it,

2635
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:42,490
you didn't have to pay per view it.

2636
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:42,910
Right.

2637
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,050
You could actually just watch him,

2638
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:46,150
which is what Bellah tour
has going for it too.

2639
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:48,580
But now Bella is on that new thing.

2640
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,370
Does zone Dazn do you know what that is?

2641
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:52,420
Well they,

2642
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,710
what they're doing is they're splitting,

2643
01:05:53,711 --> 01:05:55,030
it's like a streaming service.

2644
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,910
They're splitting half
the half the fights.

2645
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:58,560
Uh,

2646
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,370
Bella tour on paramount,

2647
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,280
which is used to be spike Fairmount.

2648
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:04,990
Half the fights on this DAZN network.

2649
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:10,530
But what's crazy is the DAZN network
just gave Canelo Alvarez $365 million.

2650
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:16,930
They just gave him this giant
deal because they had no Canelo.

2651
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:20,920
Just one could just beat triple
g unconcerned about boxing.

2652
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:21,341
You know what I'm saying?

2653
01:06:21,341 --> 01:06:21,641
Of blocks.

2654
01:06:21,641 --> 01:06:21,881
You know what?

2655
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:22,714
I fully left it.

2656
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:26,470
What we went to your place
once you're old house.

2657
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,190
Maybe you Eti,

2658
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,860
maybe a couple other people.

2659
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,710
We were watching some
pride stuff that you Dvr,

2660
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:33,653
right?

2661
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,070
And it cut off the last
fight cause it went long.

2662
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:36,761
Oh that's right.

2663
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:37,660
And then we watch watched boxing,

2664
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,410
boxing.

2665
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:40,510
And after watching two hours of MMA,

2666
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,130
you see a guy get knocked
down and they're just like,

2667
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:42,710
go to work.

2668
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:43,110
Go to word.

2669
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:43,590
Let them get up.

2670
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:43,841
You're like,

2671
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:45,070
what the fuck is this?

2672
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:49,820
So much hugging and fucking boxing socks.

2673
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:53,860
It's great if you watch really good boxers
and if you'd know you're going to go

2674
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:56,950
see boxing Canelo Alvarez fight.

2675
01:06:56,951 --> 01:06:57,970
That happened a couple of weeks ago.

2676
01:06:57,971 --> 01:06:58,960
It was a really good fight.

2677
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,460
It was a really good fight.

2678
01:07:00,461 --> 01:07:01,840
I thought triple g.

2679
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,690
Well I thought it was a real close fight,

2680
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:05,650
but if I was going to give it to someone,

2681
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:09,460
I think I would've given it to triple
g but it was close enough where you can

2682
01:07:09,461 --> 01:07:09,641
go,

2683
01:07:09,641 --> 01:07:09,851
okay,

2684
01:07:09,851 --> 01:07:12,760
this isn't a robbery but good fight,

2685
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:18,580
but leg kicks and and and take downs and
it just makes fighting more interest as

2686
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:20,230
I was just way too many fucking,

2687
01:07:20,231 --> 01:07:21,400
let's see what the judges said.

2688
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:22,211
No one.

2689
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:23,470
So nobody really one.

2690
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,540
They just got it just did better.

2691
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:26,370
Yeah.

2692
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:26,531
No,

2693
01:07:26,531 --> 01:07:27,460
we're not Beto guy.

2694
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:27,880
Right?

2695
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,210
Rarely.

2696
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,820
I mean it happens rarely.

2697
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,060
It happens less.

2698
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:31,571
Yeah.

2699
01:07:31,571 --> 01:07:32,620
The thing about Pacquiao,

2700
01:07:32,621 --> 01:07:33,490
Mayweather was like,

2701
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,110
I mean you could have kept fighting,

2702
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:35,860
right?

2703
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,120
So what have we decided?

2704
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:37,511
Right,

2705
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:37,721
right,

2706
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:38,140
right.

2707
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:38,381
Yeah.

2708
01:07:38,381 --> 01:07:39,220
After 12 rounds,

2709
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,050
they could've gotten 12
I like the early pride,

2710
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,660
like the early UFC with hoist,

2711
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,800
it's like you're going to
find me for 35 minutes.

2712
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:45,550
Right.

2713
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,740
And then we'll see eventually
I'll fucking wear you down.

2714
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,820
Yeah.

2715
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,050
That's what Nate always says.

2716
01:07:50,051 --> 01:07:50,831
Like if this was war,

2717
01:07:50,831 --> 01:07:51,664
you'd be dead.

2718
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,750
Yeah.

2719
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:53,180
Yeah.

2720
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:56,140
It's like I choked her out that he's able
to kept choking you and then just put

2721
01:07:56,141 --> 01:07:57,670
a fucking twisted your neck.

2722
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:58,683
Yeah.

2723
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:04,150
I mean if someone came along today
and did no time limit fights,

2724
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:09,420
I wonder like if you had like three big
no time limit fights like Nate versus

2725
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:10,954
Connor,

2726
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:14,050
John Jones versus DC,

2727
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:14,531
you know,

2728
01:08:14,531 --> 01:08:16,460
and have just three

2729
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:20,130
giant fights and have no time limit,

2730
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:20,950
no fight,

2731
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:22,050
Ooh,

2732
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,751
carry thing.

2733
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:24,980
To go into that kind of a fight.

2734
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:27,920
That's a different feeling like would
hoist went into and those early days of

2735
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:28,520
the UFC,

2736
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,480
it took a lot of abuse just to get like
pass guard and that slow like eight

2737
01:08:32,481 --> 01:08:34,760
minutes later he's like so slowly move.

2738
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:35,960
We're not in a rush.

2739
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:41,060
It's weird how it changes your fight
plan based on this outside influence.

2740
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:41,331
Well.

2741
01:08:41,331 --> 01:08:44,810
People also have to remember hoist
fought guys that were so much bigger than

2742
01:08:44,811 --> 01:08:45,644
massive,

2743
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:46,693
like chemo,

2744
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:52,360
chemo and chemo like was a giant roid it
up dude and was hitting him with bombs

2745
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:56,180
and and hoists was on its back and
finally caught him in an arm bar and then

2746
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:56,991
couldn't continue.

2747
01:08:56,991 --> 01:08:58,160
He couldn't fight after that.

2748
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,300
He was to focus to fight
later and he couldn't fight.

2749
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:03,350
He was just,

2750
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:04,250
he couldn't fight in the,

2751
01:09:04,251 --> 01:09:05,030
in the next fight.

2752
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:06,050
He was just too bad.

2753
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:06,884
That tournament's right?

2754
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:07,730
Yeah.

2755
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:08,563
Crazy.

2756
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:09,590
Twice in a night.

2757
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,030
They were three times in a night.

2758
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:12,170
Yeah.

2759
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:14,150
That's doesn't look out young.

2760
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,230
Big John Looks,

2761
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,850
Oh my Christ.

2762
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:17,990
He's not even going facial hair.

2763
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:18,824
Here's chemo.

2764
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:20,240
Chemo was giant.

2765
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:23,000
I mean he was so huge at
Jesus' tattooed on his stomach.

2766
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,730
Look how big he is to him.

2767
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:26,031
Yeah.

2768
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:27,380
That was a crazy ass fight,

2769
01:09:27,381 --> 01:09:28,040
man.

2770
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:28,641
That's what it was like.

2771
01:09:28,641 --> 01:09:29,990
What is this whole sport?

2772
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:30,741
I remember getting it.

2773
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:31,574
My friend's like,

2774
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:31,860
yeah,

2775
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:32,860
college dorm as hell.

2776
01:09:32,861 --> 01:09:33,440
Son.

2777
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,940
Helson Gracie in the back.

2778
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,010
I mean that was the clan man.

2779
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:37,440
Those the,

2780
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,660
the Gracie clan.

2781
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:40,160
Who was the Gracie that
was supposed to be,

2782
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:40,581
but they were like,

2783
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:41,181
you're too good.

2784
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:42,230
It'll fuck everything up.

2785
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:47,000
Hixon but the thing about it was
not just that Hickson was too good,

2786
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:50,780
but also that Hixon wouldn't listen
like no one could control Hixon.

2787
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:51,320
Oh really?

2788
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:51,560
Like,

2789
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:51,950
yeah,

2790
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:56,090
cause Horian created the UFC and
Horian was the oldest brother,

2791
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,050
Jorge and Helson.

2792
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,380
I Dunno,

2793
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,480
I'm not sure which one was right at it.

2794
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,030
There was no feelings for the route.

2795
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,640
17 seconds in a fucking
font had to do that.

2796
01:10:04,641 --> 01:10:04,821
I mean,

2797
01:10:04,821 --> 01:10:06,560
he had to close the distance
to get ahold of them.

2798
01:10:06,561 --> 01:10:07,760
You had the door open.

2799
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:08,541
He's like,

2800
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:08,781
wait,

2801
01:10:08,781 --> 01:10:09,110
wait,

2802
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:09,381
wait.

2803
01:10:09,381 --> 01:10:09,681
He's like,

2804
01:10:09,681 --> 01:10:10,161
Oh fuck.

2805
01:10:10,161 --> 01:10:10,994
This is sucky.

2806
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:12,043
Yeah,

2807
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:12,441
ready,

2808
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:13,250
go.

2809
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:13,700
Yeah.

2810
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,230
And Chemo had is risk taped up,

2811
01:10:15,231 --> 01:10:16,160
but not as knuckles.

2812
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:17,840
It's crazy tired.

2813
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:19,751
Bare knuckles,

2814
01:10:19,751 --> 01:10:21,740
stomps soccer kicks.

2815
01:10:21,741 --> 01:10:24,290
You can do anything back then
you can kick in the balls,

2816
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,520
you can knee in the balls you could haul.

2817
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:26,750
Yeah,

2818
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:26,931
right.

2819
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:27,281
That's right.

2820
01:10:27,281 --> 01:10:30,320
I remember that guy just kept wailing
on the balls that 30 times a whole bunch

2821
01:10:30,321 --> 01:10:30,730
of the guys like,

2822
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:31,021
all right,

2823
01:10:31,021 --> 01:10:31,854
all right.

2824
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:32,480
Wow.

2825
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,690
He's hackney versus Joe.

2826
01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:34,160
Simon,

2827
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,770
he fucking bald them on Joe
Simon and went to jail for rape.

2828
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:39,150
He went to jail for a yacht and then not,

2829
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,820
he murdered his cellmate.

2830
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:45,590
He went to jail for a gang rape that
they arrested him for something else and

2831
01:10:45,591 --> 01:10:47,000
they did a DNA test done.

2832
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:49,250
I once found out that he
was a part of a gang rape.

2833
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:50,613
Yeah.

2834
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,200
Look how skinny pig John Is.

2835
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,350
So small.

2836
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,030
He just felt looking so sexy.

2837
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:57,403
Like a model.

2838
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,060
This is 93 right?

2839
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,070
So this is a long ass fucking time ago,

2840
01:11:01,071 --> 01:11:01,640
man.

2841
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,610
25 years.

2842
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:03,110
Yeah.

2843
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:05,840
And Hoist headbutts he
that hoist with the head,

2844
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:10,850
but it's like the balls please fall
down so I can do what I need to do.

2845
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:11,930
Well,

2846
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:14,310
I mean he really didn't
a wrestling background.

2847
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:14,640
I mean,

2848
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,200
you see how high his hips are,

2849
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:16,711
you know,

2850
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:17,161
he didn't,

2851
01:11:17,161 --> 01:11:19,320
he didn't drop down and go for a double.

2852
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,110
He was basically claim changed.

2853
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:21,721
Yeah.

2854
01:11:21,721 --> 01:11:25,290
He was basically clinching and then hoping
he get to fight to the ground with a

2855
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:26,310
trip and there he goes.

2856
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,660
And then when he tripped him,

2857
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:29,460
chemo wound up on top of him,

2858
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:30,630
which is hilarious.

2859
01:11:30,631 --> 01:11:31,890
Like this flatten out.

2860
01:11:31,891 --> 01:11:33,600
Had his back is terrible,

2861
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:34,620
terrible position.

2862
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:38,250
Blue Hoist places just happy
that he's on the ground.

2863
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:38,851
Dude,

2864
01:11:38,851 --> 01:11:39,840
keep wrestling with me.

2865
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:41,010
I'll fucking get you.

2866
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:42,870
But look at this chemos riding his back.

2867
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:47,160
But Chemo is maybe 80 or
90 pounds heavier than him.

2868
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:48,960
It seems a lot to get off your back.

2869
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:52,170
You voice was like one 75 g two yeah,

2870
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:54,610
he was one 75 and chemo is easily,

2871
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:58,860
easily two 50 he was
a big fucking guy man.

2872
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:00,090
And there's no back of the head.

2873
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:02,760
So he's got to protect themselves
with distance and know like,

2874
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,550
and also chemo is holding
on to hoist as Geeky.

2875
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:07,141
But now look,

2876
01:12:07,141 --> 01:12:07,711
you fucked up,

2877
01:12:07,711 --> 01:12:08,544
you got tired,

2878
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,390
tired,

2879
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:10,890
look wide open God.

2880
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:12,240
And then he just didn't even try to,

2881
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:13,140
yeah,

2882
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:13,891
but he bought,

2883
01:12:13,891 --> 01:12:15,870
he bucked him off just from sheer size,

2884
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:19,320
but chemo just got exhausted
because when you're that big,

2885
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:22,290
if you don't have like a real rigorous
strength and conditioning program,

2886
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:24,130
you just get fucking
trying going in there.

2887
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:24,900
You've got no idea.

2888
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:25,800
Oh no arm bar,

2889
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:27,090
but looks not that good.

2890
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,050
A sloppy.

2891
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:28,681
He's tired,

2892
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:29,160
man.

2893
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,900
He's carrying this fucking big guys.

2894
01:12:30,901 --> 01:12:31,290
Wait.

2895
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,040
And again,

2896
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,200
they didn't have strength
and conditioning back then,

2897
01:12:34,201 --> 01:12:34,590
man.

2898
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:36,120
No one knew what the fuck they were doing.

2899
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:37,480
This was all just cut.

2900
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:38,403
Wade.

2901
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:39,803
He didn't cut anyway.

2902
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,390
Didn't know shit about nutrition.

2903
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,600
I mean in 93 man that now he,

2904
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:48,270
I remember he got ahold of that hair and
he got a fist full of hair and started

2905
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:49,220
punching him in the face.

2906
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:49,501
Really?

2907
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:50,970
Chris Distance for their
arm triangle there.

2908
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:51,770
No look at it.

2909
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:53,400
Still can't cut it at fist full of hair.

2910
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,380
It's not letting go of this.

2911
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:55,891
He's a bitch.

2912
01:12:55,891 --> 01:12:57,030
I got your hair fucked up,

2913
01:12:57,031 --> 01:12:57,240
man.

2914
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,040
Should get a haircut.

2915
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:58,351
Yeah,

2916
01:12:58,351 --> 01:13:01,020
you try to be sexy Tong Po Bullshit.

2917
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,700
But you know,

2918
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:03,160
this is,

2919
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:06,750
we learned so much about martial arts
from these fights because everybody had

2920
01:13:06,751 --> 01:13:08,780
these ideas like woodwork
and what wouldn't.

2921
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:09,810
And then once they did that it's like,

2922
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,070
oh I have to work on my ground.

2923
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,360
And then that evolved and
I have all been involved.

2924
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:18,390
Well like the old opened up Jujitsu
schools worldwide everywhere.

2925
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:20,520
And everybody wanted to be a Gracie.

2926
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,361
You know guys,

2927
01:13:21,361 --> 01:13:25,440
we're changing their name to Gracie guys
were like Marion Gracie's just to have

2928
01:13:25,441 --> 01:13:28,680
the Gracie name guys and marry a female
Gracie and then changed their name to

2929
01:13:28,681 --> 01:13:29,514
Gracie.

2930
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,900
I mean it was crazy.

2931
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:34,470
It was a difference between you making
$1 million and you make it nothing.

2932
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,110
Nobody wanted to go to Fred's Jujitsu.

2933
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:42,240
What wanted to be a part
of the Gracie Academy,

2934
01:13:42,241 --> 01:13:42,780
you know,

2935
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:43,071
like look,

2936
01:13:43,071 --> 01:13:44,340
you just get all that hair on the ground.

2937
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:44,761
What does that,

2938
01:13:44,761 --> 01:13:44,881
oh,

2939
01:13:44,881 --> 01:13:45,681
it's a hair chemo.

2940
01:13:45,681 --> 01:13:46,221
His hair.

2941
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,910
If he pulled a fistful of fucking hand,

2942
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:48,780
pulled it out.

2943
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:49,260
Yeah.

2944
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,100
What the fuck?

2945
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,260
They're both so tired.

2946
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:52,471
Oh,

2947
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:53,550
exhausted Ben.

2948
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,080
And this is the only thing fortunately.

2949
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,600
How long's this Viko I
think it went seven minutes,

2950
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:58,860
if I have to remember exactly.

2951
01:13:58,890 --> 01:13:59,671
It's crazy.

2952
01:13:59,671 --> 01:14:01,320
They're both so worn out.

2953
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,530
It looks like it's more of,

2954
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:04,230
so it's,

2955
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:05,640
what's that James Right here?

2956
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:08,370
It's about to end here for 22 oh hey.

2957
01:14:08,371 --> 01:14:09,230
He catches him,

2958
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,200
keeps going for the arm,

2959
01:14:10,201 --> 01:14:10,351
Bar,

2960
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:10,951
the triangle,

2961
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:11,621
and eventually it's like,

2962
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:12,401
I'll get one over here.

2963
01:14:12,401 --> 01:14:12,881
He gets it.

2964
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:15,490
So it was like four 28
he's catching the arm bar.

2965
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,200
So this is like first round.

2966
01:14:17,201 --> 01:14:17,650
I wonder,

2967
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:20,440
I wonder if UFC today even
knows what he's going for here.

2968
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,360
A hoist does chemo,

2969
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:23,290
chemo.

2970
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:23,741
What are you doing?

2971
01:14:23,741 --> 01:14:24,160
I don't get it.

2972
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:24,670
That's it.

2973
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:27,460
I think he more tap cause he
was exhausted than anything.

2974
01:14:27,461 --> 01:14:28,180
Like look at him.

2975
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:29,020
He's exhausted.

2976
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,543
Made a bear.

2977
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:31,960
He got the arm bar for sure.

2978
01:14:31,961 --> 01:14:32,920
But I mean barely.

2979
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:38,130
But then hoist was so beaten down by
this fight that he couldn't go on,

2980
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,820
but Hixon would have destroyed chemo.

2981
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:46,150
It would have been a completely different
thing because Hickson was strong as

2982
01:14:46,151 --> 01:14:47,020
fuck man.

2983
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,160
And Hickson was,

2984
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:52,780
there's Joseph Hickson
was a different animal.

2985
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:55,930
Like Hickson was much
more physically imposing.

2986
01:14:56,110 --> 01:15:00,640
He was about one 9,200 pounds
and he was smaller than chemo,

2987
01:15:00,641 --> 01:15:02,410
but he was jacked bodies.

2988
01:15:02,411 --> 01:15:02,731
Look at it.

2989
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:03,031
Fuck it.

2990
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:04,840
His body is just like rustler body.

2991
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:05,590
Damn.

2992
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:06,970
Well marginal wrestler bought it.

2993
01:15:06,971 --> 01:15:07,181
Yeah.

2994
01:15:07,181 --> 01:15:08,100
More bodybuilder.

2995
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:08,940
Yeah.

2996
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:09,490
Yeah.

2997
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:10,540
Whereas hoist is just,

2998
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,010
if you saw hoist with his shirt off,

2999
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:13,690
you would think that guy's a fighter.

3000
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,830
Wrap you up like a fucking package.

3001
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,000
So back to Anderson though.

3002
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:18,331
Yeah,

3003
01:15:18,331 --> 01:15:23,331
so my book ends with him are that first
leap and fight and then shattering his

3004
01:15:23,941 --> 01:15:24,480
leg,

3005
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,130
which I was in the front row for
which you didn't even believe it.

3006
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,670
It didn't make sense to
see a leg move like that.

3007
01:15:29,671 --> 01:15:30,200
You're like,

3008
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:30,600
I don't,

3009
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,433
I don't get it.

3010
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:36,200
It looked like somebody filled up a
sock with pebbles and just like hit it

3011
01:15:36,201 --> 01:15:37,800
against something and
it's like it doesn't,

3012
01:15:37,801 --> 01:15:40,710
it didn't make sense and it was so gross.

3013
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:42,540
But in the interim,

3014
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:47,910
seeing that first Charleston
and fight when he was,

3015
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:49,860
I mean he won 400 a half rounds.

3016
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:50,703
Chael Sonnen,

3017
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:53,100
he almost won the title
and then to cut that,

3018
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,270
I mean it was a la,

3019
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:56,820
such a legendary sports thing,

3020
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:57,781
not UFC,

3021
01:15:57,781 --> 01:15:58,591
but sports thing.

3022
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:02,100
How this guy's down like
crazy in a title fight.

3023
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:07,100
A guy who's never been tested was
finally tested and was losing.

3024
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:07,980
It was over.

3025
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:08,813
This guy could,

3026
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,960
Chael Sonnen was beating him.

3027
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:15,410
He figured them out and then to get
that triangle with 40 seconds left,

3028
01:16:15,661 --> 01:16:16,310
two minutes left.

3029
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:17,143
It was,

3030
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:21,900
but I remember what's so
clear and indelible in my
head is afterwards we're at

3031
01:16:21,901 --> 01:16:22,770
the entrance,

3032
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,180
everyone's cleared out of the stadium.

3033
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,950
We're at the entrance to the,

3034
01:16:25,951 --> 01:16:26,400
um,

3035
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:26,760
to the,

3036
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,330
under the,

3037
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:27,541
you know,

3038
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:28,440
the caves of the,

3039
01:16:28,441 --> 01:16:29,251
of the stadium,

3040
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,084
whatever it was.

3041
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:30,991
And it's me,

3042
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:31,501
you,

3043
01:16:31,501 --> 01:16:32,520
I think Dana,

3044
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,880
Randy was there and we're all talking.

3045
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,880
And then every once in a while somebody's
mind would go to that fight and you

3046
01:16:39,881 --> 01:16:40,591
just see him go like,

3047
01:16:40,591 --> 01:16:40,831
yeah,

3048
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,071
yeah,

3049
01:16:41,071 --> 01:16:42,210
I think the weather is pretty nice here.

3050
01:16:42,211 --> 01:16:43,140
And then you see someone go like,

3051
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:46,411
like,

3052
01:16:46,411 --> 01:16:47,460
you couldn't believe it.

3053
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,980
I remember seeing Randek a tour dude.

3054
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:49,903
Like,

3055
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:51,100
well,

3056
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,000
like why do this?

3057
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:58,020
Four minutes into the fight grabs a
hold of it or four rounds in the fight,

3058
01:16:58,021 --> 01:16:58,854
grabs a hold of that,

3059
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:02,790
syncs up the triangle and gets a
triangle armbar combination and tabs him.

3060
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,713
Wow.

3061
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,030
And this is an Anderson
came into that fight,

3062
01:17:06,031 --> 01:17:11,031
injured and are Anderson had a fucked up
rib entering into that fight and a lot

3063
01:17:11,181 --> 01:17:12,470
of people thought he
should have pulled out.

3064
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:14,600
What kind of weird edit is this?

3065
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:15,503
All the blurriness,

3066
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:17,660
all these strange fan,

3067
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:18,830
and it was nuts.

3068
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,450
It was nuts for that guy.

3069
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:22,380
He'll come see how he's
holding his side and the mode.

3070
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:22,791
The first,

3071
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:25,100
that was the first trash talk
fight ever remember to Oh,

3072
01:17:25,101 --> 01:17:28,340
Chels son and people forget
how good he was a talking shit.

3073
01:17:28,341 --> 01:17:29,174
He was the best,

3074
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:29,600
the best.

3075
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,321
He was the best.

3076
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:31,160
When I come it,

3077
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:33,500
when Anderson Silva walks into the ring,

3078
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:36,410
you could hear a mouse pissing on cotton.

3079
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:38,000
When I walk in,

3080
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:38,950
it's thunder.

3081
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,080
I mean the promos he would cut.

3082
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:42,530
Yeah.

3083
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:44,870
We're just the APP that
hadn't been done yet.

3084
01:17:44,871 --> 01:17:45,704
Now we've done a lot.

3085
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:46,071
Well,

3086
01:17:46,071 --> 01:17:47,770
Conor Mcgregor Prob,

3087
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:48,650
you know,

3088
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:51,770
it's arguable that shale
was even better than Conor.

3089
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:54,890
If you take time period into accounts,

3090
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:56,060
no one was doing right.

3091
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:56,870
He was the first.

3092
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:57,170
Yeah,

3093
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:02,000
and he was building up fights as a heel
for the first time ever and brought them

3094
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,050
in a little bit later.

3095
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:05,060
People forget how to chill,

3096
01:18:05,061 --> 01:18:05,421
could fight.

3097
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:06,710
If you go back to really,

3098
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:07,401
to me,

3099
01:18:07,401 --> 01:18:07,611
his,

3100
01:18:07,611 --> 01:18:11,120
one of his most impressive victories was
Nate Marquardt because he fought Nate

3101
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:11,480
Marquardt wouldn't meet,

3102
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:16,310
Nate was one of the best and he ragdolled
them and it was a bloody crazy chaotic

3103
01:18:16,311 --> 01:18:16,970
fight.

3104
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:17,930
And He,

3105
01:18:17,931 --> 01:18:18,381
you know,

3106
01:18:18,381 --> 01:18:20,390
he basically dominated him with wrestling,

3107
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:21,140
you know,

3108
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:22,730
chill just fought last week.

3109
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,620
He just got knocked out by fader.

3110
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,533
Damn.

3111
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:26,710
He's stopped by fate.

3112
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:27,440
Yeah.

3113
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:27,921
And you know,

3114
01:18:27,921 --> 01:18:29,330
he had some good moments in that fight.

3115
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:30,680
He had faith doors back.

3116
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:31,903
He tried,

3117
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:33,920
he tried to roll them over.

3118
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:37,940
There's a move that you do go under
the Chin when you have someone's back,

3119
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:39,640
you go under the Chin and then you,

3120
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:43,670
you somersault over and
try to carry with momentum.

3121
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:45,140
Try to carry them over.

3122
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:48,600
But it's a core strength
move head and arm.

3123
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:49,381
Well you,

3124
01:18:49,381 --> 01:18:49,821
yeah,

3125
01:18:49,821 --> 01:18:50,300
he had,

3126
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:54,020
he had the back and he was kind of
like riding high on the back end.

3127
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:54,440
He went,

3128
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,410
he felt like he had a grip under the chin.

3129
01:18:57,411 --> 01:18:58,700
I don't know how he held his hands.

3130
01:18:58,701 --> 01:19:01,460
But what you do is when
you have a guy's back,

3131
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:02,210
you,

3132
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:05,090
you hold it like this
and then you go forward.

3133
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:07,580
So you take them forward with you.

3134
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,380
That way you have their back.

3135
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,000
When you're on your back,

3136
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:12,890
you could cinch up a body triangle.

3137
01:19:12,891 --> 01:19:17,840
You could cinch up the choke but fade
or shook them off and then beat them on

3138
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:18,180
the ground.

3139
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:18,271
Yeah,

3140
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:18,981
watch how he does it.

3141
01:19:18,981 --> 01:19:20,210
So he tries to flip them,

3142
01:19:20,211 --> 01:19:20,750
oversee,

3143
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:21,471
but he lost.

3144
01:19:21,471 --> 01:19:21,830
Fuck,

3145
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:23,480
he lost control and then boom,

3146
01:19:23,481 --> 01:19:27,140
hey makers coming down from one of the
greatest ground and pound experts of all

3147
01:19:27,141 --> 01:19:30,710
time and giant difference that was
getting that are not cutting it also,

3148
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:30,981
you know,

3149
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:35,060
chill fought one 85 fade or has
been heavyweight his whole life.

3150
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,261
It's like,

3151
01:19:36,261 --> 01:19:36,561
you know,

3152
01:19:36,561 --> 01:19:38,090
there's a lot of factors in there,

3153
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,240
but uh,

3154
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:42,810
it was a good fight for as long
as it landed long as it lasted.

3155
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:43,220
Brother,

3156
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:47,960
one of the cool things that we've gotten
is the big ability to hang out casually

3157
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:48,794
with these fighters.

3158
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:52,280
Like having breakfast with Randy Singh,

3159
01:19:52,281 --> 01:19:55,580
him having with enough times with you
that I remember one time I was like going

3160
01:19:55,581 --> 01:19:57,920
into a buffet or whatever or the hotel,

3161
01:19:57,921 --> 01:20:01,490
like free breakfast and like looking
around and just having him go sit with me.

3162
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:02,090
Yeah.

3163
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:02,420
I'm like,

3164
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:03,090
okay.

3165
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:03,923
Just like,

3166
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:04,200
oh,

3167
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,420
you're just such sought after it.

3168
01:20:05,421 --> 01:20:05,780
I'm just like,

3169
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:07,320
I'm talking about nothing but

3170
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:13,160
some of my favorites were in Chicago
to going to the way ends and then like,

3171
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:17,330
let's go to the show and then
just junk drive with Clay Guido

3172
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:19,231
and like,

3173
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,710
I'll drive you just,

3174
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:21,563
it's his city,

3175
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:22,740
it's his city.

3176
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:23,581
And he's like,

3177
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:23,981
come with me.

3178
01:20:23,981 --> 01:20:24,241
And were like,

3179
01:20:24,241 --> 01:20:24,870
okay,

3180
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:26,430
and you white knuckling,

3181
01:20:26,431 --> 01:20:27,630
holding onto the front seat.

3182
01:20:27,631 --> 01:20:31,830
I see he's swerving with a brown
paper bag drives like he fights

3183
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:34,680
and I'm just like,

3184
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,431
I accept that.

3185
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:40,070
So either way about it and he would
just go in for it on these highways.

3186
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:40,581
He knows.

3187
01:20:40,581 --> 01:20:42,990
And then I believe the
rain and it was just like,

3188
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,990
I wish I was like so fun.

3189
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,383
Yeah.

3190
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:50,040
Another one that I
remember early on early on,

3191
01:20:50,041 --> 01:20:50,731
John Jones,

3192
01:20:50,731 --> 01:20:51,690
he wasn't anything then,

3193
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:52,600
which foreign?

3194
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:52,771
Oh,

3195
01:20:52,771 --> 01:20:53,880
maybe something like that.

3196
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,290
Um,

3197
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:56,123
meeting him,

3198
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:56,880
uh,

3199
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,661
talking about shit,

3200
01:20:57,661 --> 01:21:00,670
and I could talk about this now because
it's not no longer a banned substance in

3201
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,291
the UFC,

3202
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:01,711
but like,

3203
01:21:01,711 --> 01:21:02,544
uh,

3204
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:04,710
talking about weed and was like,

3205
01:21:04,711 --> 01:21:04,871
yeah,

3206
01:21:04,871 --> 01:21:05,730
let's smoke bro.

3207
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:06,900
He wasn't anything,

3208
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,960
it wasn't anything and just going like,

3209
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:10,270
he was like,

3210
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:10,711
who's got wait?

3211
01:21:10,711 --> 01:21:10,920
I'm like,

3212
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:11,041
oh,

3213
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:11,671
Rogan's got it.

3214
01:21:11,671 --> 01:21:14,790
But he's in his hotel room
and texting you flip phone,

3215
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:17,400
texting you doc when it wasn't cool.

3216
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,740
You don't have to have like hip to
have a flip phone where it's like,

3217
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:20,640
that's all anybody had.

3218
01:21:20,641 --> 01:21:21,480
That's how long ago.

3219
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:22,981
And then just go on.

3220
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:24,420
Like maybe it's that,

3221
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:25,280
maybe it was early,

3222
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:25,530
uh,

3223
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:25,921
iPhone,

3224
01:21:25,921 --> 01:21:26,970
but like just going,

3225
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:27,720
hey man,

3226
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:28,553
are you up?

3227
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:29,161
And you're like,

3228
01:21:29,161 --> 01:21:29,680
y'all kind of,

3229
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,513
and go to sleep.

3230
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:31,471
And was like,

3231
01:21:31,471 --> 01:21:32,131
Fuck John.

3232
01:21:32,131 --> 01:21:33,750
I think he's doesn't want us up there.

3233
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:34,740
And then be like,

3234
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:34,891
no,

3235
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:34,981
no,

3236
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:35,371
let's go.

3237
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:36,000
He's got the weed.

3238
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,780
Let's go.

3239
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:38,040
Because some fan gave it to us.

3240
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:38,281
Right?

3241
01:21:38,281 --> 01:21:41,790
You had this fucking him
like tin foil of Weed and um,

3242
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:43,000
and just knock on your door and be like,

3243
01:21:43,001 --> 01:21:43,770
what?

3244
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:44,221
And you're like,

3245
01:21:44,221 --> 01:21:45,054
uh,

3246
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,010
she retired and it was like,

3247
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:47,400
um,

3248
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:47,761
do you have that?

3249
01:21:47,761 --> 01:21:48,600
We'd like to come on,

3250
01:21:48,601 --> 01:21:49,181
I want to go to sleep.

3251
01:21:49,181 --> 01:21:49,470
It's like,

3252
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:49,711
man,

3253
01:21:49,711 --> 01:21:50,461
John want to smoke?

3254
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:50,821
And you're like,

3255
01:21:50,821 --> 01:21:51,451
you looked at us,

3256
01:21:51,451 --> 01:21:54,180
you open the door fully looked at me and
this young fighter and you were like,

3257
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:56,183
come on in.

3258
01:21:57,030 --> 01:22:00,450
And we all smoked pot together and this
hotel room and fucking wherever it was,

3259
01:22:00,451 --> 01:22:01,171
I think Montreal.

3260
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:02,004
Ashley's Montreal.

3261
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:02,730
Yeah.

3262
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:04,050
And you're just a fun time.

3263
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:08,100
And then seeing this guy move on to
become the baddest motherfucker on the

3264
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:08,520
planet.

3265
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,530
But we also had a
conversation with him about,

3266
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:10,920
I was,

3267
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,390
I wanted him to go to a different camp.

3268
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:13,141
That's right.

3269
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:16,350
He was training in fucking
youtube videos in New York.

3270
01:22:16,351 --> 01:22:16,800
Yeah.

3271
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,120
With his buddies in a garage.

3272
01:22:18,121 --> 01:22:18,841
You too good.

3273
01:22:18,841 --> 01:22:19,201
I'm like,

3274
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:20,360
you should be in a real cash.

3275
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:20,971
That's right.

3276
01:22:20,971 --> 01:22:23,610
We had that over weed in the hotel room.

3277
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:24,061
He's like,

3278
01:22:24,061 --> 01:22:24,661
you really think so.

3279
01:22:24,661 --> 01:22:24,901
I go,

3280
01:22:24,901 --> 01:22:25,201
I know.

3281
01:22:25,201 --> 01:22:26,250
So I know.

3282
01:22:26,251 --> 01:22:26,461
I go,

3283
01:22:26,461 --> 01:22:28,140
you only have a certain
amount of time in this thing.

3284
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:32,220
I go and your time should be
invested with a real coach.

3285
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:34,170
Who's going to hone your skills.

3286
01:22:34,171 --> 01:22:34,850
I grow you.

3287
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:35,730
You could be an all time.

3288
01:22:35,731 --> 01:22:36,564
Great man.

3289
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:37,643
Wow.

3290
01:22:37,650 --> 01:22:37,890
Yeah,

3291
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:38,910
I remember telling him that and he's like,

3292
01:22:38,911 --> 01:22:39,570
you really think so.

3293
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:39,781
I go,

3294
01:22:39,781 --> 01:22:40,081
I know.

3295
01:22:40,081 --> 01:22:40,801
So I know.

3296
01:22:40,801 --> 01:22:41,301
So you,

3297
01:22:41,301 --> 01:22:42,450
you really got to move on.

3298
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,740
I forgot about that part of it.

3299
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:44,190
That,

3300
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:47,780
how influential was that in the
fucking future of mixed martial arts?

3301
01:22:47,781 --> 01:22:48,750
So I hope it helped.

3302
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:49,561
You know he did.

3303
01:22:49,561 --> 01:22:51,520
He went to Winkeljohn Jack's Jackson,

3304
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:52,710
uncle John Eventually.

3305
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:53,371
I mean,

3306
01:22:53,371 --> 01:22:53,800
he'd probably be,

3307
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:54,960
we might've done it anyway.

3308
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,220
He might owe knows,

3309
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:56,990
but uh,

3310
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:57,221
I,

3311
01:22:57,221 --> 01:23:00,030
I think it was a good conversation
to have with a young guy.

3312
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:00,331
You know,

3313
01:23:00,331 --> 01:23:00,750
I was like,

3314
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:01,460
listen man,

3315
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:01,620
you,

3316
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:01,900
you,

3317
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:02,600
you,

3318
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,960
you have real talent.

3319
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,830
Like you could really be something,

3320
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:07,360
but you gotta be,

3321
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:12,480
you gotta be coached by guys who are
going to find out your tendency technique

3322
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:13,511
isn't worth,

3323
01:23:13,511 --> 01:23:15,040
isn't going to go take you that far.

3324
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:15,551
Well,

3325
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:16,060
I mean,

3326
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:16,601
fucking,

3327
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:17,440
he was so good.

3328
01:23:17,441 --> 01:23:19,600
Who knows how far he might've
been a world champion,

3329
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:21,310
even with the camp that he was in.

3330
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:25,960
He's so good and his wrestling is so
powerful and he's so physically talented,

3331
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:31,290
but it made a big difference for him to
go to Jackson's and be able to train on

3332
01:23:33,731 --> 01:23:38,731
a regular basis with world class fighters
being there on a daily basis with

3333
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:41,530
Carlos condit who is,

3334
01:23:41,531 --> 01:23:41,741
you know,

3335
01:23:41,741 --> 01:23:43,480
at the top of his game back then.

3336
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:47,920
And I mean Keith Jardeen
and they just had a massive,

3337
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:49,410
they had ruined tailors,

3338
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:50,380
the,

3339
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:55,180
they called it the ring of fire where
you would go five rounds of sparring with

3340
01:23:55,181 --> 01:23:59,410
to get ready for a fight
with a different high level.

3341
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,273
I mean,

3342
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:01,780
highest level fighter.

3343
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,100
So like Nate Marquardt like,

3344
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:03,341
cool.

3345
01:24:03,341 --> 01:24:05,950
That was where I won't out of here at
Giardia and you'd come in and now I just

3346
01:24:05,951 --> 01:24:07,390
finished a fucking route
with Nate Marquardt.

3347
01:24:07,391 --> 01:24:09,040
Now I gotta go with kicked Jardeen cool.

3348
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:09,903
Round three.

3349
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:10,210
Yeah,

3350
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:10,461
charge.

3351
01:24:10,461 --> 01:24:10,991
Didn't get out.

3352
01:24:10,991 --> 01:24:12,790
Jon Jones who come in and it's like,

3353
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:13,150
what?

3354
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:13,983
I mean,

3355
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:15,070
the training you got there.

3356
01:24:15,071 --> 01:24:15,311
Correct.

3357
01:24:15,311 --> 01:24:16,001
Johnson's camp.

3358
01:24:16,001 --> 01:24:16,450
We're like,

3359
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:16,990
well,

3360
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:17,680
yeah,

3361
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,310
I mean,

3362
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:18,641
look,

3363
01:24:18,641 --> 01:24:22,020
there's a reason why so many extremely
high level fighters are coming down

3364
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:22,151
there.

3365
01:24:22,151 --> 01:24:24,010
And then Rashad Evans
was there as well too.

3366
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:27,490
And Rashad had a real problem with John
Coming there because Rashad was like,

3367
01:24:27,491 --> 01:24:27,641
hey,

3368
01:24:27,641 --> 01:24:29,140
this guy's in my weight class,

3369
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,521
but what are you going to do?

3370
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:31,031
I have one guy,

3371
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:31,790
he's way class.

3372
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:32,590
Right.

3373
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:33,423
It's an issue.

3374
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:34,540
Yeah.

3375
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:35,440
And then you know,

3376
01:24:35,441 --> 01:24:37,860
Rishad and John became friends.

3377
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:39,453
They did fight.

3378
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,030
Did they would,

3379
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:40,840
yes,

3380
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:41,440
they fought.

3381
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,970
And John beat the shit out of him.

3382
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:46,510
I don't even remember that they fought
after they had a big falling out because

3383
01:24:46,511 --> 01:24:48,220
Rashad was upset that,

3384
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:48,670
you know,

3385
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:49,540
John Wound up,

3386
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:51,280
John Wound up getting a title shot,

3387
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:52,090
uh,

3388
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:54,790
and beat Shogun because
Rashad got injured.

3389
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:57,370
Rashad was supposed to get the title shot,

3390
01:24:57,610 --> 01:25:02,050
John Steps in and they were friends at
the time and then somewhere along the

3391
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:03,820
line then the trash talk started,

3392
01:25:03,821 --> 01:25:04,061
you know,

3393
01:25:04,061 --> 01:25:05,050
I'll fight Rashad,

3394
01:25:05,051 --> 01:25:05,560
fuck it.

3395
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,221
And then it was like,

3396
01:25:06,221 --> 01:25:06,371
man,

3397
01:25:06,371 --> 01:25:07,630
I thought we were friends and then,

3398
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:08,021
oh yeah,

3399
01:25:08,021 --> 01:25:08,980
that's back when it was like,

3400
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:09,290
you know,

3401
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:10,570
you guys can fight as
front and [inaudible].

3402
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:12,560
You don't have to like be at enemies.

3403
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:13,370
Everybody fight.

3404
01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:16,000
It's a sport and it's a money thing.

3405
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:18,340
And then when John beat him,

3406
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:23,370
it was a real drubbing
and it was a five rounds.

3407
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:27,010
It was a decision and uh,

3408
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,900
it was a real clear cut,

3409
01:25:28,901 --> 01:25:29,770
unanimous decision.

3410
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:31,810
He did some crazy shit to him.

3411
01:25:31,811 --> 01:25:33,820
Like step in elbow to the face.

3412
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:36,130
I kind of do remember this one now.

3413
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:38,670
This was John when he was developing John.

3414
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:39,521
It wasn't even John,

3415
01:25:39,521 --> 01:25:41,290
like the John that knocked out DC.

3416
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:42,970
I remember him when he sang it in fights.

3417
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:46,420
I didn't really ever see this with the
fighters where he would talk about after

3418
01:25:46,421 --> 01:25:46,930
wins,

3419
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:48,130
talking about the holes,

3420
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,170
the fuck ups he had more than the,

3421
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,020
what he did right was most
guys would be braggadocious,

3422
01:25:53,021 --> 01:25:53,890
but I loved it.

3423
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:56,290
But it was like he was upset
at things that went wrong.

3424
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:56,501
Yeah,

3425
01:25:56,501 --> 01:25:57,610
I guess I got to cover that up.

3426
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:58,540
That could get exposed.

3427
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,793
You know,

3428
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,120
John's a fucking smart dude.

3429
01:26:01,121 --> 01:26:03,100
I mean is reckless and chaotic as he is.

3430
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:03,501
And you know,

3431
01:26:03,501 --> 01:26:04,340
I've said this before

3432
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:08,030
that I don't know what causes
that kind of recklessness,

3433
01:26:08,031 --> 01:26:13,031
but there is a direct correlation
between traumatic brain injury,

3434
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,120
brain damage and impulsive
behavior and recklessness.

3435
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,020
It's a fact.

3436
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:19,460
It's well researched.

3437
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,670
It's well documented in neuroscience.

3438
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:24,050
They know that this,

3439
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:24,680
this is a,

3440
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,550
there's a connection.

3441
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,030
I don't want to exonerate
him from his past behavior,

3442
01:26:29,031 --> 01:26:31,880
but we see that in football players,

3443
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:35,990
we see that in BMX riders that go crazy
and fucking land on their head a bunch

3444
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:36,620
of times.

3445
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:36,980
People,

3446
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:37,850
they get crazy,

3447
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:39,980
they get wild and impulsive.

3448
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,090
It's just a fact.

3449
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,290
It's just a part of the game.

3450
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:43,101
You know,

3451
01:26:43,101 --> 01:26:43,440
they,

3452
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:43,880
they,

3453
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:48,880
those people that engage in any kind of
an activity where you bring gets rattled

3454
01:26:48,951 --> 01:26:50,000
on a regular basis,

3455
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:54,110
you are way more likely to do ridiculous
things that don't make any sense.

3456
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:55,370
Yeah,

3457
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:56,203
it does.

3458
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,650
And so what I said about John,

3459
01:26:57,651 --> 01:26:58,820
have you talked to John about it?

3460
01:26:59,270 --> 01:26:59,900
You know,

3461
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:00,733
um,

3462
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:02,263
and you know,

3463
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:07,700
I know John was upset with me after one
of those things before we actually did a

3464
01:27:07,701 --> 01:27:08,540
podcast together.

3465
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:09,470
He was upset and I said,

3466
01:27:09,471 --> 01:27:10,070
listen man,

3467
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:13,130
I have to be honest about everything.

3468
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:16,430
I have to be honest about how I feel
about every single aspect of your

3469
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:17,264
performance,

3470
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:18,680
of your behavior.

3471
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:19,573
I have to be,

3472
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:20,630
it doesn't mean I don't love you.

3473
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:21,650
Doesn't mean I don't think you were great.

3474
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,360
I hate to give your commentary on stuff.

3475
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,400
I have to be,

3476
01:27:25,401 --> 01:27:26,480
you don't really choose sides.

3477
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:27,051
I can't,

3478
01:27:27,051 --> 01:27:27,501
I can't,

3479
01:27:27,501 --> 01:27:29,090
not only can I not choose sides,

3480
01:27:29,091 --> 01:27:31,100
I have to call what I see.

3481
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:31,520
It's,

3482
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,320
it's everything because if I don't,

3483
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:34,580
then no one's going to listen to me.

3484
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:35,910
There's just cause I have a comment on it.

3485
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:36,630
Go ahead.

3486
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:36,781
No,

3487
01:27:36,781 --> 01:27:37,440
go ahead.

3488
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:37,600
Well,

3489
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:41,850
I remember finding it interesting
that after Brock beat heath herring,

3490
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:42,630
yeah.

3491
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:43,463
Um,

3492
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:48,510
went to whatever steakhouse he wants
to and heath coming in afterwards and

3493
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:49,711
looking right at,

3494
01:27:49,711 --> 01:27:51,270
you said like it wasn't good.

3495
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:51,380
He,

3496
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:53,010
you were critical of him,

3497
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:53,580
right?

3498
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:54,600
He sought you out as I can.

3499
01:27:54,601 --> 01:27:55,110
I talk to you.

3500
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:55,530
And it was like,

3501
01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:55,951
oh fuck,

3502
01:27:55,951 --> 01:27:56,491
he's mad.

3503
01:27:56,491 --> 01:27:57,030
But he's like,

3504
01:27:57,030 --> 01:28:00,090
he just wanted to express to you they
had this leg injury and that's why he

3505
01:28:00,091 --> 01:28:01,590
couldn't really defend that takedown.

3506
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:06,150
But it's interesting how the fighters
that I get to see these fighters respect

3507
01:28:06,151 --> 01:28:09,210
your opinion enough to want
to explain their side of it.

3508
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:10,463
Well I appreciate it.

3509
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:11,970
Um,

3510
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:13,320
and there's always a side,

3511
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:16,200
like what was talking about that fighter
that has this pretty significant injury

3512
01:28:16,201 --> 01:28:17,220
that he's dealing with right now.

3513
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:21,210
Like most people don't even know and they
wouldn't have known if he didn't tell

3514
01:28:21,211 --> 01:28:21,630
you.

3515
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:24,000
And there's a lot of these guys that
go into fights and they're really

3516
01:28:24,001 --> 01:28:24,711
compromised.

3517
01:28:24,711 --> 01:28:24,940
You know,

3518
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:26,460
they have hand injuries,

3519
01:28:26,461 --> 01:28:27,211
back injuries,

3520
01:28:27,211 --> 01:28:28,044
neck injuries.

3521
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:31,110
And this is just a part of
this crazy sport where you're,

3522
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,660
the whole objective is to injure people.

3523
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,360
So you're injuring each
other in training and

3524
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:38,270
when you got to hide those injuries,

3525
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:39,440
cause then they'll exploit them.

3526
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:40,510
Yeah.

3527
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:42,210
But then there's the,

3528
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:45,760
but this is why one of the reasons why
I have to be honest all the time is

3529
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:46,660
because people,

3530
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,550
they respect the fact
that I'm not going to,

3531
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,540
I'm not saying things
because it sounds cool.

3532
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:56,590
I'm saying things because this is actually
what I see and it maybe you have a

3533
01:28:56,591 --> 01:28:59,350
different perspective and maybe you
could share your perspective with me and

3534
01:28:59,351 --> 01:29:01,800
I'll tell you why I thought this
and maybe I'll change my mind

3535
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,480
and I'm not scared to change my mind,

3536
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:05,520
but we've got to say what I think.

3537
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:05,761
Yeah.

3538
01:29:05,761 --> 01:29:06,390
And it's cool.

3539
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:06,751
The fighters,

3540
01:29:06,751 --> 01:29:07,290
like I just said,

3541
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:08,550
I wasn't being a pussy to see it.

3542
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:09,170
I mean,

3543
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:13,350
I would never think Keith haring
would be a pussy care that you know,

3544
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:14,250
the real truth of it.

3545
01:29:14,251 --> 01:29:14,390
Right.

3546
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:15,330
And not that it was bad,

3547
01:29:15,331 --> 01:29:16,260
but like here's the reason.

3548
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:19,380
It was interesting how they
respect your opinion like that.

3549
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:20,110
What guy?

3550
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:21,300
Like Brock list or man,

3551
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:24,240
I swear that if Brock Lesnar got into the,

3552
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:28,980
into mixed martial arts right out of
college when college wrestler right into

3553
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:29,491
training,

3554
01:29:29,491 --> 01:29:34,350
really learned striking and learned
slowly like took some small fight.

3555
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:35,190
Jon Jones did.

3556
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:35,850
Yeah.

3557
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:36,270
Yeah.

3558
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:37,103
And then,

3559
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:42,410
but really learn striking instead of
like spending all that time doing WWE,

3560
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:44,670
which I'm sure he made
a fuck load of money.

3561
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:46,860
I mean good for him.

3562
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:48,330
That's all great and everything like that.

3563
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:49,230
But man,

3564
01:29:49,231 --> 01:29:52,500
I think he could have been one of the
all time greats are really do a really

3565
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:54,090
song.

3566
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:54,890
Nobody,

3567
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:55,261
nobody.

3568
01:29:55,261 --> 01:29:57,540
I remember cutting that
much to heavyweight,

3569
01:29:58,110 --> 01:29:58,970
these giant,

3570
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,910
but that was all weights would weigh
in with their jeans on because they're

3571
01:30:01,911 --> 01:30:02,061
like,

3572
01:30:02,061 --> 01:30:02,610
all right,

3573
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:03,310
whatever I am.

3574
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:04,080
It was also,

3575
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,640
there was no testing back then.

3576
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:09,330
I know you've got to realize that
the testing back then was horse shit.

3577
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:10,440
And the way to be,

3578
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:14,700
the best way to show the
testing was horseshit was to
show when Alistair Overeem

3579
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:15,534
fought Brock.

3580
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:17,100
That was the steroid Olympics,

3581
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,980
those two guys together
inside the octagon.

3582
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:20,700
Uh,

3583
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:25,700
but that was also Brock less than a year
from diverticulitis surgery where they

3584
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:31,161
had to remove I think 12
inches of his colon or is um,

3585
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:32,290
well it was,

3586
01:30:32,290 --> 01:30:35,130
it's not even an immediate or I thought
it was at the time then I talked to,

3587
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,451
of all people,

3588
01:30:36,451 --> 01:30:41,170
Anthony Bordain told me now people get
diverticulitis sometimes from seeds like

3589
01:30:41,171 --> 01:30:41,420
a,

3590
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:42,930
it'll get stuck in your intestines.

3591
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:44,003
So they had wrong.

3592
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:44,281
Yeah,

3593
01:30:44,281 --> 01:30:46,350
well it's just things
get caught and stuck.

3594
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:47,040
Um,

3595
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:47,530
but they,

3596
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:51,060
they had to remove 12
inches of his intestines.

3597
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,110
So that opened him

3598
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:54,391
while he was,

3599
01:30:54,391 --> 01:30:55,470
and then he came back.

3600
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:56,620
But he was done as,

3601
01:30:56,621 --> 01:30:58,650
as the Brock Lesnar that everybody feared.

3602
01:30:58,830 --> 01:30:59,011
Well,

3603
01:30:59,011 --> 01:30:59,460
he,

3604
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:02,040
he says that he was
compromised even before that.

3605
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:06,540
He said he was compromised before the
cane fight and before a lot of his other

3606
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:06,781
fights,

3607
01:31:06,781 --> 01:31:09,650
even the fight with chain
Carwyn from diverticulitis,

3608
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:12,450
like who is suffering from it
from a law for a long time.

3609
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:13,890
And he just thought that,

3610
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:14,160
you know,

3611
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,930
it was just exhausted from training,

3612
01:31:15,931 --> 01:31:19,140
but really he was having this
blockage and all this issue.

3613
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:20,280
Look at this.

3614
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,120
Jesus.

3615
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:21,781
Yeah,

3616
01:31:21,781 --> 01:31:22,141
it was fun.

3617
01:31:22,141 --> 01:31:24,690
Talking to a as two 56 is incorrect.

3618
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:25,171
By the way,

3619
01:31:25,171 --> 01:31:26,040
that's not true.

3620
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:27,451
When he waited,

3621
01:31:27,451 --> 01:31:29,220
he was to 65.

3622
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:30,870
If you look at it over him over,

3623
01:31:30,871 --> 01:31:33,540
he was over in was to 65 as well.

3624
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:37,020
And if you look at ovary on
the scale for that fight,

3625
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:37,560
there's a,

3626
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:37,881
there's,

3627
01:31:37,881 --> 01:31:38,280
there's,

3628
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:42,020
that's a great picture of the two of them
facing down like Jesus Christ or bolts

3629
01:31:42,021 --> 01:31:42,854
so jacked,

3630
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:43,830
so big.

3631
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:44,730
But it's not like there's six,

3632
01:31:44,731 --> 01:31:45,330
10.

3633
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:46,163
When Overeem,

3634
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:50,100
when Overeem was,

3635
01:31:50,101 --> 01:31:50,760
um,

3636
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,800
was standing there flexing on the scale,

3637
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,191
you know,

3638
01:31:53,191 --> 01:31:55,580
like what in the fuck is he on?

3639
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,433
Like right there.

3640
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:58,800
What the fuck dude?

3641
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:00,123
Wow.

3642
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:03,280
How he's not even like
really fucking hard.

3643
01:32:03,281 --> 01:32:04,120
He's still smiling.

3644
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:10,680
So Jack that he was so fuck,

3645
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:14,790
what was Anderson's friends a trainer's
name or manager's name to Paul Chek.

3646
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:15,530
Gosh.

3647
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:16,050
Oh,

3648
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:16,721
oh,

3649
01:32:16,721 --> 01:32:18,220
I'm ed source.

3650
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:18,641
That source.

3651
01:32:18,641 --> 01:32:18,970
Yeah.

3652
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:19,731
And we were to ask him,

3653
01:32:19,731 --> 01:32:21,550
but like I bought the pride days.

3654
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:22,180
He was like,

3655
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:22,271
oh,

3656
01:32:22,271 --> 01:32:24,310
they tested for steroids
and pride and you were like,

3657
01:32:24,311 --> 01:32:25,144
what?

3658
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:26,440
They tested for steroids?

3659
01:32:26,441 --> 01:32:26,680
It goes,

3660
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:26,861
yeah.

3661
01:32:26,861 --> 01:32:27,041
I mean,

3662
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:27,910
they didn't do anything about it,

3663
01:32:27,911 --> 01:32:28,330
but they're just,

3664
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:30,070
they're dusted with like
get your both positive.

3665
01:32:30,071 --> 01:32:30,431
Go fight.

3666
01:32:30,431 --> 01:32:30,980
Who Cares?

3667
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:31,390
Yeah.

3668
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:31,641
Well,

3669
01:32:31,641 --> 01:32:32,980
according to ensign anyway.

3670
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:34,990
Not only did they not test in pride,

3671
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:36,370
they put it in the contract.

3672
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,360
We do not test for steroids.

3673
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:38,440
Oh,

3674
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:40,330
I thought he said they
tested it and then just like,

3675
01:32:40,331 --> 01:32:41,164
we don't give a shit,

3676
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,460
but just want to know.

3677
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,390
I think they test,

3678
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:43,870
they took,

3679
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:44,950
they took tests,

3680
01:32:44,951 --> 01:32:46,480
but they didn't really test you.

3681
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:46,901
Damn.

3682
01:32:46,901 --> 01:32:50,080
Those guys are big ring card
girl that she was so young.

3683
01:32:50,081 --> 01:32:50,650
Which one was that?

3684
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:51,483
Oh,

3685
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,160
he was a gold Barilla son.

3686
01:32:54,161 --> 01:32:54,994
Jesus.

3687
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:56,800
It's blonde hair.

3688
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:57,281
He should,

3689
01:32:57,281 --> 01:33:00,630
he should have been Nazi in the
war that he's missed his call.

3690
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:03,640
He would have been the one of
the most feared Nazis there were.

3691
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,571
Honestly,

3692
01:33:04,571 --> 01:33:05,620
if he was a fucking Nazi,

3693
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:06,700
I would have rooted for the other team.

3694
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:09,520
He was a viking Nazi's dude.

3695
01:33:09,521 --> 01:33:11,920
He would have been on one of them
boats with a dragon on the front of it.

3696
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:15,813
By the way,

3697
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:18,850
I mean underrated Jon
Jones for a weed head.

3698
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:20,141
I mean,

3699
01:33:20,141 --> 01:33:20,230
yeah,

3700
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:23,610
everybody gives all the credit
to fucking Nate and nick fair.

3701
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:24,483
They've earned it.

3702
01:33:24,610 --> 01:33:27,000
But when you would give a
fuck at those breast strips,

3703
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:28,840
half a strip was the dose.

3704
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,010
That's right.

3705
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:30,631
And on the plane.

3706
01:33:30,631 --> 01:33:30,971
And he was like,

3707
01:33:30,971 --> 01:33:31,560
how'd you got it?

3708
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:32,111
What am I find?

3709
01:33:32,111 --> 01:33:33,550
His compliments was Jon Jones.

3710
01:33:33,551 --> 01:33:34,540
I heard somebody else goes,

3711
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:34,901
hey,

3712
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:35,600
you know John's always,

3713
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:36,433
it always goes,

3714
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:37,383
or just your fear.

3715
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:38,440
It's always got great weed.

3716
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:39,970
Yes.

3717
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:40,930
Hell fucking yes.

3718
01:33:40,931 --> 01:33:41,764
I'll take that.

3719
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:44,630
I gave him a package of breath
strips and he ate the whole bag

3720
01:33:47,650 --> 01:33:48,371
is the dose.

3721
01:33:48,371 --> 01:33:49,750
He took two and you're like,

3722
01:33:49,751 --> 01:33:49,901
don't,

3723
01:33:49,901 --> 01:33:50,060
don't,

3724
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:50,670
don't do that.

3725
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:51,071
He's like,

3726
01:33:51,071 --> 01:33:51,491
Joe Rogan,

3727
01:33:51,491 --> 01:33:52,324
I'll be fine.

3728
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:53,050
It was fine.

3729
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:54,250
I was so scared for him.

3730
01:33:54,730 --> 01:33:59,320
I was paranoid because I gave Tommy
buns a half and we flew to Florida.

3731
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:00,400
And uh,

3732
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,420
he told me,

3733
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,170
he goes,

3734
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:02,590
dude,

3735
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:03,130
he goes,

3736
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:04,470
I swear to God when we landed,

3737
01:34:04,471 --> 01:34:04,730
he told,

3738
01:34:04,730 --> 01:34:04,990
he goes,

3739
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:06,540
I didn't think I was gonna make it.

3740
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,110
It was like one of those with you before.

3741
01:34:08,111 --> 01:34:08,950
I really thought,

3742
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:10,150
I really thought I couldn't make it.

3743
01:34:10,151 --> 01:34:13,570
I really thought there's no way I'm
going to be able to survive this flight.

3744
01:34:13,571 --> 01:34:14,351
I'm going to freak out.

3745
01:34:14,351 --> 01:34:15,580
I'm going to have them land somewhere.

3746
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:17,830
I almost told the stewardess
before he took off.

3747
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:19,410
I was close to be like,

3748
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:20,490
we're not doing,

3749
01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:22,240
we're not doing this before
we were on the runway.

3750
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:25,330
The only thing that stopped me from doing
it is knowing the abuse I would have

3751
01:34:25,331 --> 01:34:26,350
taken from you verbally.

3752
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:27,520
That's two years.

3753
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:28,241
Then I'm like,

3754
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:29,074
I'd rather die.

3755
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:30,940
I love those days.

3756
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:32,170
It was so fun.

3757
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:33,423
I was actually,

3758
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:36,130
I felt bad for you a
couple of times in my life.

3759
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:37,120
Why?

3760
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,230
One time me and nick use,

3761
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:41,200
if we're doing a corporate and Vegas
and went to the new Aria and we took

3762
01:34:41,201 --> 01:34:43,270
edibles and we walked
around and I was like,

3763
01:34:43,330 --> 01:34:43,451
oh,

3764
01:34:43,451 --> 01:34:44,760
Rogan's too famous and Bega,

3765
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:45,640
he can't do this.

3766
01:34:45,641 --> 01:34:47,200
He can't get this fucked
up and walk around,

3767
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:48,760
but,

3768
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:51,310
but watching the fights on edibles,

3769
01:34:51,610 --> 01:34:52,030
I'm like,

3770
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:52,141
oh,

3771
01:34:52,141 --> 01:34:52,721
it's too bad.

3772
01:34:52,721 --> 01:34:53,840
You don't get to experience that.

3773
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:54,250
Yeah,

3774
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:55,180
you can't do that.

3775
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:57,950
You can't have to do
commentary 100% sober.

3776
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,750
I tried early in the days,

3777
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:00,741
early in the day.

3778
01:35:00,741 --> 01:35:03,740
I did like one or two events where I
was a little fucked up and I was like,

3779
01:35:03,741 --> 01:35:04,880
this is just too cloudy.

3780
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:07,490
I want to think cause I would
want to talk about other shit.

3781
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:08,403
Right.

3782
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:09,620
The fight will be going on.

3783
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:11,690
I want to talk about this thing.

3784
01:35:11,691 --> 01:35:12,800
Ray Tattoo on his back

3785
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:16,100
and his last fights he was on there.

3786
01:35:16,101 --> 01:35:18,080
I think a guy who the
fucking big black dude beat.

3787
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:19,120
Okay.

3788
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:20,960
Unless 13 seconds Volkov yeah,

3789
01:35:20,961 --> 01:35:22,070
I think he has a sting ray.

3790
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,210
I thought it was like,

3791
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:23,601
oh yeah.

3792
01:35:23,601 --> 01:35:24,440
It is kind of a sting,

3793
01:35:24,441 --> 01:35:24,620
right?

3794
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:25,880
I could see you going
like what a great fun.

3795
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:28,880
Two stingers or some of the most
underrated to creatures there are.

3796
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:29,691
First of all,

3797
01:35:29,691 --> 01:35:30,231
they're peaceful.

3798
01:35:30,231 --> 01:35:33,360
Should have been involved in
millions and millions of years.

3799
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:36,350
We're strange thing to have tattoos on
your back and wonder if he's like an

3800
01:35:36,351 --> 01:35:37,184
ocean guy.

3801
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:38,540
It's really an

3802
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:41,360
ice.

3803
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,200
We swam with those.

3804
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:45,650
Forget where.

3805
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:46,471
Oh,

3806
01:35:46,471 --> 01:35:46,950
Flores.

3807
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:47,790
Off of florists.

3808
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:48,180
Really?

3809
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:48,341
Yeah.

3810
01:35:48,341 --> 01:35:49,620
Near where the Komodo dragons are.

3811
01:35:49,650 --> 01:35:50,700
You fucking dive in.

3812
01:35:50,701 --> 01:35:52,970
And he went to the isle of Flores.

3813
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:53,580
Oh,

3814
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:53,911
that's,

3815
01:35:53,911 --> 01:35:55,950
that's where that little fucking man

3816
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:56,903
lived.

3817
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:57,301
You know,

3818
01:35:57,301 --> 01:35:57,930
they had that,

3819
01:35:57,930 --> 01:35:59,700
that human being that they found,

3820
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,600
what do they call it?

3821
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:01,230
Um,

3822
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:03,330
Homo Floresiensis this,

3823
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:04,290
I think they call it.

3824
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:04,851
Yeah.

3825
01:36:04,851 --> 01:36:06,090
It was a little tiny hobbit,

3826
01:36:06,091 --> 01:36:07,590
like person that existed,

3827
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:12,780
I want to say as recently
as 10 to 15,000 years ago,

3828
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:16,770
there was like a three
foot tall kind of human.

3829
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:17,850
Yeah.

3830
01:36:17,850 --> 01:36:18,460
There was,

3831
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:21,570
there's been many different
branches of human being,

3832
01:36:21,571 --> 01:36:21,841
right.

3833
01:36:21,841 --> 01:36:23,640
There's been neanderthals,

3834
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:24,630
Homo Sapiens,

3835
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:29,300
there's a one from Russia die
in isis or something like that.

3836
01:36:29,301 --> 01:36:29,880
I forget how to say,

3837
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:30,090
like,

3838
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:30,451
look at that.

3839
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:31,020
Oh yeah,

3840
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:31,171
no,

3841
01:36:31,171 --> 01:36:31,681
I met that guy.

3842
01:36:31,681 --> 01:36:32,311
He ran a hostel.

3843
01:36:32,311 --> 01:36:32,880
I stood up.

3844
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:33,271
Yeah.

3845
01:36:33,271 --> 01:36:34,650
That guy was the shit.

3846
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:35,221
He gave me.

3847
01:36:35,221 --> 01:36:35,820
Good,

3848
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:36,653
good drugs.

3849
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:40,110
But this little little person that lived,

3850
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:40,690
uh,

3851
01:36:40,690 --> 01:36:42,150
alongside human beings,

3852
01:36:42,450 --> 01:36:42,990
what,

3853
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:44,460
see if my timeline is right.

3854
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:47,220
They have speech they don't know,

3855
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,780
but they know they use tools.

3856
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:49,803
I don't know.

3857
01:36:50,770 --> 01:36:52,720
That always makes sure to paint
them with tool to show you what,

3858
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:53,990
95,000,

3859
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:54,990
70,000 years ago.

3860
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:55,141
Oh,

3861
01:36:55,141 --> 01:36:55,530
that's it.

3862
01:36:55,530 --> 01:36:56,940
17,000 years ago.

3863
01:36:56,970 --> 01:36:57,620
Wow.

3864
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:59,550
Why does it say he
bunked w what's that one?

3865
01:36:59,551 --> 01:36:59,941
Hobbit.

3866
01:36:59,941 --> 01:37:01,140
Human species debunked.

3867
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:02,460
I don't think that's correct.

3868
01:37:02,461 --> 01:37:03,780
It says new historian,

3869
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:04,681
but uh,

3870
01:37:04,681 --> 01:37:08,590
I'm pretty sure that's probably
an old article or audiences.

3871
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:09,301
What year?

3872
01:37:09,301 --> 01:37:10,170
What was that article?

3873
01:37:10,171 --> 01:37:11,004
When is that?

3874
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:12,083
10 years ago.

3875
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:12,820
10 years ago?

3876
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:13,653
Yeah.

3877
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:14,673
Was it 10 years ago?

3878
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:17,950
2004 the talking about it.

3879
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:18,893
I'm sorry,

3880
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:21,930
so it's 2014 is the article
that's fairly recently.

3881
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:23,880
I don't think that's the consensus.

3882
01:37:23,881 --> 01:37:26,040
I don't think the consensus
is that it's been debunked.

3883
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:28,960
Tongue part is about the
cranial volume or something.

3884
01:37:29,190 --> 01:37:29,580
Oh,

3885
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:30,413
brain size,

3886
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,250
but not that it was a separate species.

3887
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:36,420
Cranium volume was calculated
to be 430 million milliliters,

3888
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:40,290
which puts it within the range of
modern human living in the same region.

3889
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:44,490
They went further comparing the size
of the circumference of the Occipital,

3890
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:48,450
said the word occipital frontal
section of the skull to patients with

3891
01:37:48,451 --> 01:37:50,220
developmental disorders in that region.

3892
01:37:50,221 --> 01:37:50,641
The planet.

3893
01:37:50,641 --> 01:37:52,920
They found the measurements
were indeed similar.

3894
01:37:53,190 --> 01:37:55,830
If lb one did have down syndrome,

3895
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:58,680
then it would explain
this short femurs as well.

3896
01:37:58,681 --> 01:37:59,400
Hence,

3897
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:02,010
when calculated statistically
for normal growth,

3898
01:38:02,011 --> 01:38:04,350
they would yield a height
of just over four feet,

3899
01:38:04,351 --> 01:38:06,780
which matches up with some
humans living on Flores.

3900
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:07,620
Wow.

3901
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:08,400
Hmm.

3902
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:08,761
This is,

3903
01:38:08,761 --> 01:38:12,180
I think this is probably one of
those heavily debated things,

3904
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:13,800
but you're trying to recreate,

3905
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:14,220
you know,

3906
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:17,390
there's a thing called island
dwarfism that happens too.

3907
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:17,760
Um,

3908
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,020
it's,

3909
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:18,781
it's a really odd,

3910
01:38:18,781 --> 01:38:20,310
because it happens to mammals,

3911
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:23,430
but the opposite takes place
with lizards and reptile.

3912
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:24,293
Massive.

3913
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:24,540
Yeah.

3914
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:27,600
Reptiles get massive like Komodo
dragons on the island of Comodo.

3915
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:29,670
Scariest giant.

3916
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,020
They get huge.

3917
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:32,700
They're their monitor lizards really,

3918
01:38:32,701 --> 01:38:34,020
essentially that are enormous.

3919
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:37,290
Whereas elephants that
live on islands get tiny.

3920
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:38,670
They have these warf elephants.

3921
01:38:38,671 --> 01:38:39,504
Yeah.

3922
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:39,991
Yeah.

3923
01:38:39,991 --> 01:38:43,350
See that island morphis
room to have to cover,

3924
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:45,180
so no less resources.

3925
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,650
So they adapt to the taxes.

3926
01:38:47,670 --> 01:38:48,300
Less food.

3927
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:48,451
Like,

3928
01:38:48,451 --> 01:38:50,760
look how tiny that elephant
is that lives on those.

3929
01:38:50,761 --> 01:38:51,031
I mean,

3930
01:38:51,031 --> 01:38:52,800
it's an elephant that's
like shorter than you.

3931
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:53,730
Wow.

3932
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:54,760
And Elephant.

3933
01:38:54,770 --> 01:38:55,530
It's through.

3934
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:56,010
Yeah.

3935
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:56,520
It's like,

3936
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:59,400
that's like a elephant
that's like my kid's height.

3937
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:00,811
Like this is,

3938
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:02,520
it happens with all sorts
of different animals.

3939
01:39:02,521 --> 01:39:03,810
He Dwarf Buffalo.

3940
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:04,920
Yeah.

3941
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:05,910
Island dwarfism.

3942
01:39:05,911 --> 01:39:10,140
They think it's because these animals
adapt to the fact that there's a limited

3943
01:39:10,141 --> 01:39:12,230
amount of living on a territory.

3944
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:12,580
Right.

3945
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:14,820
They don't have to cover long
distances to get to something.

3946
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:15,000
Yeah.

3947
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,130
It's fucking crazy what
happens with animals,

3948
01:39:17,131 --> 01:39:20,820
men when they figure out like
what they need to do to survive.

3949
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:25,410
Like one of the things that a I was
reading about really recently was um,

3950
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,110
these,

3951
01:39:26,110 --> 01:39:26,820
uh,

3952
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:27,361
fuck,

3953
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:29,640
I wish I had it off the top of my head,

3954
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,350
but these moths that
lived in a separate area,

3955
01:39:34,351 --> 01:39:39,351
an area where things were darker and they
change from a light colored moth to a

3956
01:39:39,571 --> 01:39:40,650
black moth.

3957
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:42,090
Like really quickly.

3958
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:42,960
Really?

3959
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,351
Yeah.

3960
01:39:43,351 --> 01:39:44,340
Like really quickly.

3961
01:39:44,341 --> 01:39:47,640
Like they did it over a
couple of generations and
they're trying to figure out

3962
01:39:47,641 --> 01:39:48,900
how the fuck this happened.

3963
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:52,590
See if he could find that couple
of generations peppered moth.

3964
01:39:52,591 --> 01:39:53,070
Yeah.

3965
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:53,881
Really fast.

3966
01:39:53,881 --> 01:39:54,141
Like it,

3967
01:39:54,141 --> 01:39:55,170
it blew them away.

3968
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:57,510
They don't understand how
it happened so quickly.

3969
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:58,500
I think there's like,

3970
01:39:58,890 --> 01:39:59,311
there's,

3971
01:39:59,311 --> 01:40:04,050
there's so little that's truly understood
about what adaptive changes can

3972
01:40:04,051 --> 01:40:05,730
possibly happen within animals.

3973
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:10,050
Like for instances is documentary called
relentless enemies and it's all about

3974
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:11,250
you're going to piss in something

3975
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:14,550
we're going to use though.

3976
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:15,413
Kombucha bottle.

3977
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:15,841
Okay.

3978
01:40:15,841 --> 01:40:16,740
Where's the bottle?

3979
01:40:16,830 --> 01:40:17,130
Okay.

3980
01:40:17,130 --> 01:40:17,251
Oh,

3981
01:40:17,251 --> 01:40:17,800
sorry.

3982
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:17,901
Oh,

3983
01:40:17,901 --> 01:40:18,840
I thought that was full.

3984
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:19,860
It's the widest mouth.

3985
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:20,651
Oh,

3986
01:40:20,651 --> 01:40:21,450
okay.

3987
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:22,111
You know what you should do?

3988
01:40:22,111 --> 01:40:23,580
You should get one of those um,

3989
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:26,700
ice bags that people use for.

3990
01:40:26,701 --> 01:40:27,534
Um,

3991
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:30,510
definitely don't show that it
will get kicked off of Youtube.

3992
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:33,120
There's a ice bags that um,

3993
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:37,860
people use like compression ice bags
and they have like a nice wide mouth.

3994
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:38,251
Oh,

3995
01:40:38,251 --> 01:40:38,780
that's cool.

3996
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:39,780
I had some of them here,

3997
01:40:39,781 --> 01:40:41,190
but I don't want to give it to God.

3998
01:40:41,191 --> 01:40:42,024
Dammit.

3999
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:42,960
That's listening in it.

4000
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:44,610
It didn't work so much.

4001
01:40:44,611 --> 01:40:45,091
Piss through.

4002
01:40:45,091 --> 01:40:45,924
Much piss.

4003
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:46,470
Okay.

4004
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:47,303
What else do we got?

4005
01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:48,203
Nothing.

4006
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:53,580
Top ones off the topping it off.

4007
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:54,070
I'll use this.

4008
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,730
I'll use this.

4009
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:57,280
Why don't you just run off to the bathroom
real quick and just hold onto your

4010
01:40:57,281 --> 01:40:57,951
deck and scared.

4011
01:40:57,951 --> 01:40:58,330
Jeff,

4012
01:40:58,330 --> 01:40:59,200
why don't you just suck it?

4013
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:01,120
I don't think I want to do that.

4014
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:02,380
Don't piss in that cup please.

4015
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:03,513
What do you got?

4016
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:06,130
What's that other of Tumbler?

4017
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:06,311
Yeah,

4018
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:06,581
go ahead.

4019
01:41:06,581 --> 01:41:07,414
Pissing that could,

4020
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:08,273
I don't know what that's for.

4021
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:12,490
Definitely take the piss out
of here though afterwards.

4022
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,051
You don't want it with me.

4023
01:41:14,051 --> 01:41:14,884
I'm like a wasted

4024
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:18,753
pieces with it.

4025
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,710
That's the thing is I bet you
could sell that bit in and out.

4026
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:23,190
That's like the pissed
it was Andrea roads.

4027
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:24,110
This is Ari.

4028
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:27,510
Shaffir is piss for real
on episode two was 47.

4029
01:41:27,511 --> 01:41:29,320
It was witchcraft.

4030
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:33,220
Alright.

4031
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:34,660
Give it a shake and let's get back to you.

4032
01:41:34,661 --> 01:41:35,120
Okay.

4033
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:35,953
All right.

4034
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:37,360
Jamie's turned his head away.

4035
01:41:37,361 --> 01:41:38,194
He's afraid of Dicks.

4036
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:39,010
Trying to be,

4037
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:39,843
don't be afraid.

4038
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:40,713
The glory.

4039
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:42,510
No.

4040
01:41:42,510 --> 01:41:42,910
Uh,

4041
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:44,380
I believe this might be actually,

4042
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:44,830
yeah.

4043
01:41:44,830 --> 01:41:45,041
Yeah,

4044
01:41:45,041 --> 01:41:45,430
they are.

4045
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:46,470
How fucking comfortable with those.

4046
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:47,270
The best.

4047
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:48,550
The only one of the,

4048
01:41:48,551 --> 01:41:48,941
only two,

4049
01:41:48,941 --> 01:41:52,450
maybe them and blue apron and the only
like no longer sponsors that I'm like,

4050
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:53,470
I'll still rep your guys.

4051
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:55,240
What's going on with you and sponsors?

4052
01:41:55,241 --> 01:41:55,540
Did,

4053
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:59,230
did something happen when
you said something crazy
but a sponsor and they give

4054
01:41:59,231 --> 01:42:00,064
you a hard time.

4055
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:00,761
Yeah,

4056
01:42:00,761 --> 01:42:01,080
man.

4057
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:01,601
Get recruiter.

4058
01:42:01,601 --> 01:42:02,190
Was that what it was?

4059
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:02,401
Yeah.

4060
01:42:02,401 --> 01:42:03,220
It's okay.

4061
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:03,760
I get it.

4062
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:04,511
I'm not for everybody,

4063
01:42:04,511 --> 01:42:05,920
but then it's like we're,

4064
01:42:05,930 --> 01:42:06,940
we can't work together anymore.

4065
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:07,390
Yeah.

4066
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:07,721
I just,

4067
01:42:07,721 --> 01:42:09,700
I can't operate under the idea
that you can tell him what to say.

4068
01:42:10,330 --> 01:42:11,020
What'd they say?

4069
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:12,850
Don't say something they
said it's offensive.

4070
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:13,481
When I'm like,

4071
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:15,550
what did you say it?

4072
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:18,460
I think it was something
along the lines of like a,

4073
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:22,250
if you're a human resources
person and you have to a higher,

4074
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:22,650
you can,

4075
01:42:22,650 --> 01:42:24,340
your time can be spent better,

4076
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:25,180
you know,

4077
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:25,901
doing something else.

4078
01:42:25,901 --> 01:42:27,430
You could fucking quickly hire somebody,

4079
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:28,180
used Zipcar,

4080
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:29,830
and then spend all your time
masturbating in your office.

4081
01:42:29,831 --> 01:42:33,700
You can bring in like a Ziploc bag and
keep putting like use socks in there that

4082
01:42:33,701 --> 01:42:34,401
you masturbated into.

4083
01:42:34,401 --> 01:42:34,661
I don't know.

4084
01:42:34,661 --> 01:42:37,240
I'm just going off top of
my head trying to be funny.

4085
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,193
It's pretty reasonable.

4086
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:40,420
Three minute read on a one minute by yeah.

4087
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:41,531
And then they're like,

4088
01:42:41,531 --> 01:42:42,010
it's offensive.

4089
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:43,000
Like that's fine.

4090
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:43,810
All right.

4091
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:45,220
But I can't be thinking about it.

4092
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,830
I refuse to let myself think about,

4093
01:42:46,850 --> 01:42:47,683
so I'll just give up the money.

4094
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:48,793
Yeah.

4095
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:50,203
Yeah.

4096
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:51,580
I've had some people get pissed at me.

4097
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,000
Yeah.

4098
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:52,990
And it's fair on their part.

4099
01:42:52,991 --> 01:42:53,824
I get it.

4100
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:54,581
I don't agree,

4101
01:42:54,581 --> 01:42:55,211
but I get it.

4102
01:42:55,211 --> 01:42:55,571
That's your,

4103
01:42:55,571 --> 01:42:56,290
that's your right.

4104
01:42:56,290 --> 01:42:58,150
Some of our Vistage is language.

4105
01:42:58,210 --> 01:42:58,420
Yeah,

4106
01:42:58,420 --> 01:42:58,841
exactly.

4107
01:42:58,841 --> 01:42:59,140
But I'm like,

4108
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:00,310
that's not the way I'm going to do it,

4109
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,230
so we're done.

4110
01:43:02,860 --> 01:43:04,650
It's such a foolhardy way of looking.

4111
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:05,441
I believe that too.

4112
01:43:05,441 --> 01:43:08,730
I believe a good sponsor read that
one I did was to Gora for stock,

4113
01:43:08,731 --> 01:43:10,480
but beds where I was like,

4114
01:43:10,650 --> 01:43:12,850
he ain't getting pegged
in the ass by Christine,

4115
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:14,950
Christina and a,

4116
01:43:14,951 --> 01:43:15,910
and he's fucking bleeding,

4117
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:16,990
but his knees are Oh,

4118
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:18,700
so soft and the Saatva mattress.

4119
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:19,871
It's like,

4120
01:43:19,871 --> 01:43:20,271
dude,

4121
01:43:20,271 --> 01:43:20,770
man,

4122
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:21,760
they got Super Mad.

4123
01:43:21,761 --> 01:43:23,650
They're going to go back in
and edit and take it down.

4124
01:43:23,651 --> 01:43:23,981
Which I'm like,

4125
01:43:23,981 --> 01:43:24,101
no,

4126
01:43:24,101 --> 01:43:26,110
you're giving me more work to not pay me.

4127
01:43:26,111 --> 01:43:26,411
He said,

4128
01:43:26,411 --> 01:43:27,130
take it down.

4129
01:43:27,130 --> 01:43:27,371
Yeah,

4130
01:43:27,371 --> 01:43:28,860
so I had to go reedit well,

4131
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:29,141
why?

4132
01:43:29,141 --> 01:43:31,390
Why do they have the
right to say take it down?

4133
01:43:31,391 --> 01:43:31,901
Because they're like,

4134
01:43:31,901 --> 01:43:32,141
come on,

4135
01:43:32,141 --> 01:43:32,891
we're a family company.

4136
01:43:32,891 --> 01:43:33,100
I'm like,

4137
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:33,933
dude,

4138
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:35,650
my listeners aren't family.

4139
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:37,481
I'm the Ra.

4140
01:43:37,481 --> 01:43:38,760
She fears can exactly.

4141
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:39,850
Family Company.

4142
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:40,870
Exactly and I'm like,

4143
01:43:40,871 --> 01:43:41,350
guys,

4144
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:44,200
I can give you gold once in a
while if you let me be fully free,

4145
01:43:44,630 --> 01:43:47,030
I can give you something
that got passed around a,

4146
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,720
I remember Berg up
naturebox pissed at him.

4147
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:50,120
He goes,

4148
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:51,070
it's fucking healthy.

4149
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:51,380
Hey,

4150
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:51,680
hey,

4151
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:52,280
have a fucking

4152
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:52,950
apple.

4153
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:53,300
Yeah,

4154
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:54,140
why do you want to eat healthy?

4155
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:56,030
Well that goes against like,

4156
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:58,250
I won't shit on the actual products.

4157
01:43:58,820 --> 01:43:59,840
He couldn't help it.

4158
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:03,350
They gave him the copy and it's
like the healthiest snacks.

4159
01:44:04,510 --> 01:44:05,360
He doesn't preread it.

4160
01:44:05,361 --> 01:44:06,040
He just reads.

4161
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:08,060
It strikes bullshit with
them and you're like,

4162
01:44:08,061 --> 01:44:08,480
Nah,

4163
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:08,851
I don't know.

4164
01:44:08,851 --> 01:44:09,684
I know we're done.

4165
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:11,360
Well,

4166
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:15,590
there are some like irrefutable sponsors,

4167
01:44:15,591 --> 01:44:16,131
like for me,

4168
01:44:16,131 --> 01:44:17,660
Squarespace irrefutable,

4169
01:44:17,661 --> 01:44:18,530
awesome product,

4170
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:20,870
but they always let me
go do whatever I want.

4171
01:44:20,871 --> 01:44:21,810
Whatever the fuck you mean.

4172
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:22,370
Andy's,

4173
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:23,730
if I started saying I wear me on,

4174
01:44:23,731 --> 01:44:24,400
these are super credible.

4175
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,810
Also when you have that last
bit of calm on your Dick,

4176
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,340
it'll soak them up perfectly.

4177
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:28,670
They,

4178
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:29,300
they'd be like,

4179
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:29,930
whatever.

4180
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:30,763
They don't care.

4181
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,111
They're not saying,

4182
01:44:33,111 --> 01:44:33,920
how dare you.

4183
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:34,430
I'll be like,

4184
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:34,641
hey,

4185
01:44:34,641 --> 01:44:36,320
the get the dark ones that
cover up the fucking blood.

4186
01:44:36,321 --> 01:44:37,520
That comes out of your house really well,

4187
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,140
they'd be like,

4188
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:39,231
Oh,

4189
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:40,400
you're not shitting on the product.

4190
01:44:40,401 --> 01:44:41,510
You're not saying it's uncomfortable.

4191
01:44:41,511 --> 01:44:42,344
So go ahead.

4192
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:43,050
Yeah.

4193
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:44,600
So super corporate guys,

4194
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:47,410
the ones that zip recruiter
or that kind of shit.

4195
01:44:47,411 --> 01:44:48,244
Yeah,

4196
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:48,450
yeah,

4197
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:49,190
I guess.

4198
01:44:49,190 --> 01:44:49,611
And it's like,

4199
01:44:49,611 --> 01:44:50,181
it's fine.

4200
01:44:50,181 --> 01:44:51,014
It's just signs.

4201
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:51,620
Yeah.

4202
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:56,620
I make money by continuously focusing on
free speech and I'll lose money in some

4203
01:44:58,341 --> 01:45:01,040
spots and makes money and other spots
and this is all just part of it.

4204
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:01,401
Yeah.

4205
01:45:01,401 --> 01:45:05,810
You can't really think about it like
only looking to make money every time.

4206
01:45:05,811 --> 01:45:08,930
Make more cause that
universal growth paradigm,

4207
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:09,171
you know,

4208
01:45:09,171 --> 01:45:12,020
that's only for corporations and then
I'm going to be doing straight ad reads

4209
01:45:12,021 --> 01:45:13,370
and my listeners can get bored as fuck.

4210
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:14,300
I'm going to lose listeners.

4211
01:45:14,301 --> 01:45:17,240
So then I'll be able to make less money
off ads in the long run because of that

4212
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:19,590
more as less money as opposed
to like fewer ads more.

4213
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:20,450
It's like,

4214
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:21,290
well not only that,

4215
01:45:21,291 --> 01:45:23,420
it's like how much time
do we really have left?

4216
01:45:23,530 --> 01:45:24,363
Yeah.

4217
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,310
If we,

4218
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:28,400
if both of us live another 45 years,

4219
01:45:28,401 --> 01:45:30,320
would it be fucking amazing?

4220
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:31,130
Yeah.

4221
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:34,550
That's 45 seasons of sober October's,

4222
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:36,050
you know,

4223
01:45:36,050 --> 01:45:37,490
that would be amazing.

4224
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:38,070
Oh No.

4225
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:40,730
Two 45 the less sober October done.

4226
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:42,470
I shouldn't have gotten
roped into this one.

4227
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:44,630
Are you done because of the contest?

4228
01:45:44,631 --> 01:45:46,340
Are you done because of the sobriety.

4229
01:45:46,341 --> 01:45:48,020
So what can we do in January?

4230
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:48,981
Why January?

4231
01:45:48,981 --> 01:45:51,320
So October is the best
drinking month in New York.

4232
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:52,610
We could definitely do it in January,

4233
01:45:52,611 --> 01:45:54,140
but w w New Year's Eve.

4234
01:45:54,630 --> 01:45:55,463
Oh yeah.

4235
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,880
Or February even.

4236
01:45:58,350 --> 01:45:59,183
Yeah,

4237
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:03,840
because technically after midnight you'd
still be fucked up and you would never,

4238
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:04,940
I wouldn't mind November.

4239
01:46:05,090 --> 01:46:05,301
Yeah.

4240
01:46:05,301 --> 01:46:05,841
No booze.

4241
01:46:05,841 --> 01:46:06,470
November.

4242
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:06,801
No booze.

4243
01:46:06,801 --> 01:46:07,241
November.

4244
01:46:07,241 --> 01:46:07,350
What?

4245
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:08,390
He buttoned thanksgiving.

4246
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:09,290
You have a little Turkey.

4247
01:46:09,291 --> 01:46:09,780
You want a nice,

4248
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,960
I honestly though Thanksgiving,

4249
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:12,471
the memories.

4250
01:46:12,471 --> 01:46:13,304
You have a thanksgiving.

4251
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:14,450
We'll childhood.

4252
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:15,770
They're not alcohol based?

4253
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:16,550
No,

4254
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:17,383
not really.

4255
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:18,291
You might want something,

4256
01:46:18,291 --> 01:46:19,410
but that's what she really wants.

4257
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:20,720
If you said no stuffing,

4258
01:46:20,721 --> 01:46:20,961
he'd be like,

4259
01:46:20,961 --> 01:46:21,351
hold on.

4260
01:46:21,351 --> 01:46:22,184
That's part of it.

4261
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:24,040
But no alcohol and Thanksgiving,

4262
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:24,920
that's not a big deal.

4263
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:27,960
What about March?

4264
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:28,853
March is okay.

4265
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:30,020
More sober march.

4266
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:30,621
Sure.

4267
01:46:30,621 --> 01:46:31,790
That's hard to bullshit.

4268
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:32,480
Month.

4269
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,710
The fuck goes on in March.

4270
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:34,700
March is a bullshit month.

4271
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:35,923
March madness.

4272
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:36,890
St Patrick's Day.

4273
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:38,330
Saint Patrick's Day is March.

4274
01:46:38,610 --> 01:46:38,770
Yeah,

4275
01:46:38,770 --> 01:46:39,100
it is.

4276
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:39,440
Yeah.

4277
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:40,280
But yeah,

4278
01:46:40,281 --> 01:46:41,150
but I'm not Irish.

4279
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,290
I'm barely Irish.

4280
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:45,620
Quarter Irish spring big.

4281
01:46:45,621 --> 01:46:46,370
Well guess what we're in.

4282
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:47,550
We don't have that anymore.

4283
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:49,890
You've got to go whatever.

4284
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,780
There's always a reason by
October is a one of them.

4285
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:54,150
All the Nyu kids have calmed
down and going to classes.

4286
01:46:54,151 --> 01:46:54,890
So like you can actually,

4287
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:56,460
the cities back two years again.

4288
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:57,773
It's amazing.

4289
01:46:58,410 --> 01:46:59,243
And it's like,

4290
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:01,050
it's fucking hard.

4291
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:01,310
I just,

4292
01:47:01,310 --> 01:47:02,131
I passed my bars.

4293
01:47:02,131 --> 01:47:02,311
I'm like,

4294
01:47:02,311 --> 01:47:02,971
I want to fucking go.

4295
01:47:02,971 --> 01:47:04,680
I want to go with Jay and be like,

4296
01:47:04,681 --> 01:47:06,000
let's go to fucking neighborhood bar.

4297
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:07,830
It's fucking awful.

4298
01:47:07,870 --> 01:47:08,551
Couple of days away,

4299
01:47:08,551 --> 01:47:08,881
buddy.

4300
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:11,640
We're only 10 days left now.

4301
01:47:11,641 --> 01:47:12,000
It's just,

4302
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,530
what's really important
is that we beat Bert.

4303
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:14,401
I for sure.

4304
01:47:14,401 --> 01:47:15,270
I don't care if you win.

4305
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:16,160
I don't care if Tom Quinn,

4306
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,270
as long as Bert loses as
long as Britain users.

4307
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:18,751
Can I,

4308
01:47:18,751 --> 01:47:19,170
um,

4309
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:20,160
can I tell you,

4310
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:22,110
can we talk about drugs at
the UFC for a little bit?

4311
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:22,950
Sure.

4312
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:27,950
So with Diaz always bringing the breath
strips there be this time where it

4313
01:47:29,131 --> 01:47:29,950
wouldn't kick in,

4314
01:47:29,950 --> 01:47:30,600
it wouldn't kick it.

4315
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,680
And you look over like feeling it.

4316
01:47:31,681 --> 01:47:31,950
You'd be like,

4317
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:32,130
ah,

4318
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:33,270
maybe sort of or,

4319
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:35,460
or one of those jolly
ranchers that they'd have.

4320
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:36,740
I remember having a side,

4321
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,140
I remember eating a jolly rancher like
before the fight started because I would

4322
01:47:40,141 --> 01:47:41,100
get an answer early with you.

4323
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:43,350
And I'm kind shocking.

4324
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,060
I'm like the US and some other guy.

4325
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:47,010
Nobody knew me back then and it was like,

4326
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:47,371
dude,

4327
01:47:47,371 --> 01:47:48,700
I think somebody's smoking weed or look,

4328
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:49,720
no,

4329
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:50,160
we come from,

4330
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:53,190
from home and he smelled the
weed from the jolly ranchers.

4331
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:54,050
Yeah.

4332
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:57,330
And nobody could comprehend back then
that it could be coming from your jolly

4333
01:47:57,331 --> 01:47:57,661
rancher.

4334
01:47:57,661 --> 01:48:00,030
It's Olay from smokeable 2003.

4335
01:48:01,830 --> 01:48:02,663
Um,

4336
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:04,030
and then you look over,

4337
01:48:04,030 --> 01:48:04,980
you're feeling it sort of,

4338
01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:06,030
and then you look over again.

4339
01:48:06,031 --> 01:48:10,320
And Diaz just like in a trance
when you realized you are too,

4340
01:48:10,321 --> 01:48:11,530
and you both look and Diego

4341
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:14,761
and you know,

4342
01:48:14,761 --> 01:48:15,650
he bought the devil in.

4343
01:48:15,650 --> 01:48:16,170
Yeah.

4344
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:17,730
And it was just fucking great.

4345
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:18,151
And that's,

4346
01:48:18,151 --> 01:48:18,331
I mean,

4347
01:48:18,331 --> 01:48:18,990
I've talked about something,

4348
01:48:18,990 --> 01:48:19,681
this is not happening.

4349
01:48:19,681 --> 01:48:21,630
Stories where it's like you don't
even know who's winning fights.

4350
01:48:21,631 --> 01:48:23,100
You just know you're
enjoying watching them.

4351
01:48:23,101 --> 01:48:23,670
Acid,

4352
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:24,720
one of the UFC events.

4353
01:48:25,170 --> 01:48:25,710
Yeah.

4354
01:48:25,710 --> 01:48:27,360
Back when we were sitting
with kill scene and,

4355
01:48:27,361 --> 01:48:27,900
and uh,

4356
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:28,733
and uh,

4357
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:32,580
we didn't tell him red band
new and just do an acid.

4358
01:48:32,581 --> 01:48:33,290
I remember how low,

4359
01:48:33,290 --> 01:48:34,650
how into it you were,

4360
01:48:34,830 --> 01:48:37,620
that part of me is you never quite
know how people can react to things.

4361
01:48:37,621 --> 01:48:38,520
So you really know them.

4362
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:41,970
And like it could have gone
like it was my place of work.

4363
01:48:41,971 --> 01:48:42,570
You can't,

4364
01:48:42,570 --> 01:48:43,260
you know,

4365
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:44,550
a small part of me thinks maybe,

4366
01:48:44,820 --> 01:48:47,970
but then you're texting us while you're
in the fights where all you guys,

4367
01:48:47,971 --> 01:48:48,481
where are you got to sit?

4368
01:48:48,481 --> 01:48:49,320
And it wasn't one of those,

4369
01:48:49,321 --> 01:48:50,071
we got bottom floor,

4370
01:48:50,071 --> 01:48:51,840
we're in the fucking stands for that one.

4371
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:54,630
And we kept looking at
us until you found us.

4372
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:59,380
Like Dan's every I like
you're doing as a great,

4373
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:00,421
Oh man,

4374
01:49:00,421 --> 01:49:02,100
I've never saw see stuff so clearly.

4375
01:49:02,101 --> 01:49:05,910
I remember Forrest Griffin coming in
with a shipping up to Boston playing and

4376
01:49:05,911 --> 01:49:06,691
everyone cheering.

4377
01:49:06,691 --> 01:49:07,111
And I was like,

4378
01:49:07,111 --> 01:49:07,980
this is the Colosseum.

4379
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:11,140
We're watching what it was like in the
coliseum for a few people fighting lions.

4380
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,190
This is the,

4381
01:49:12,190 --> 01:49:13,590
everyone's cheering for blood.

4382
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:15,660
How are we different than the Romans?

4383
01:49:16,410 --> 01:49:18,060
Pretty fucking similar in a lot of ways.

4384
01:49:18,090 --> 01:49:18,470
Yeah.

4385
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:19,171
Just a modern,

4386
01:49:19,171 --> 01:49:20,640
more acceptable version of it.

4387
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:21,451
Oh,

4388
01:49:21,451 --> 01:49:23,790
that acid that you have
seen with so fucking good.

4389
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:25,280
It was great.

4390
01:49:25,281 --> 01:49:26,490
He didn't want any food.

4391
01:49:26,491 --> 01:49:28,380
Red Bank sorta took care
of you a little bit.

4392
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:29,130
He was like,

4393
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:29,311
oh,

4394
01:49:29,311 --> 01:49:31,920
I'll have some of the fucking
auntie Dolores cookies.

4395
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:33,331
Yeah,

4396
01:49:33,331 --> 01:49:34,380
we've done,

4397
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:35,250
I mean,

4398
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:39,780
I went to a bunch of events outside of
the UFC where we got really fucked up on

4399
01:49:39,781 --> 01:49:43,530
Adam went to that one and a at
the playboy mansion Strikeforce.

4400
01:49:43,550 --> 01:49:43,830
Yeah,

4401
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:44,191
we got,

4402
01:49:44,191 --> 01:49:45,120
we got fucked on those.

4403
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:46,230
Blasted in that one.

4404
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:46,740
Yeah.

4405
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:47,410
That was,

4406
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:48,070
I missed out

4407
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,940
on a lot of that.

4408
01:49:48,970 --> 01:49:52,300
Like you guys sitting there in the
audience had a lot more fun than

4409
01:49:52,550 --> 01:49:55,190
six hours of fucking greatness.

4410
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:58,770
So you take him early and by the very
end it's like you're just coming down

4411
01:49:58,771 --> 01:49:59,211
enough to like,

4412
01:49:59,211 --> 01:50:00,560
let's go eat these dykes,

4413
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:01,610
Joe Rogan's.

4414
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:02,271
Buying again,

4415
01:50:02,271 --> 01:50:03,104
let's go.

4416
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:05,703
Ah,

4417
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:10,970
there was one in Calgary where it fell
on shrimp fest and it was with Duncan and

4418
01:50:10,971 --> 01:50:11,331
I was like,

4419
01:50:11,331 --> 01:50:11,451
Hey,

4420
01:50:11,451 --> 01:50:12,410
I got as mushrooms,

4421
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:13,340
and he goes,

4422
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:13,621
oh,

4423
01:50:13,621 --> 01:50:13,910
I don't,

4424
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:14,271
I don't,

4425
01:50:14,271 --> 01:50:14,811
I don't want to come.

4426
01:50:14,811 --> 01:50:15,950
I don't want to take mushrooms right now.

4427
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:16,350
And I was like,

4428
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:16,641
okay,

4429
01:50:16,641 --> 01:50:17,360
I'll just throw them out.

4430
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,530
I'll have to get the
mushrooms I have for you.

4431
01:50:18,531 --> 01:50:19,161
I'll throw them out,

4432
01:50:19,161 --> 01:50:20,720
I'll step on them on the
ground and throw them out.

4433
01:50:20,721 --> 01:50:21,071
So he went to,

4434
01:50:21,071 --> 01:50:21,291
he goes,

4435
01:50:21,291 --> 01:50:21,591
all right,

4436
01:50:21,591 --> 01:50:22,011
relax.

4437
01:50:22,011 --> 01:50:22,844
I'll take them off.

4438
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,250
And Man,

4439
01:50:25,670 --> 01:50:29,180
it's so fun there because
like you would take them,

4440
01:50:29,181 --> 01:50:29,751
you get bored,

4441
01:50:29,751 --> 01:50:30,740
there's some wrestling fight,

4442
01:50:30,741 --> 01:50:31,071
you know,

4443
01:50:31,071 --> 01:50:33,860
where it's like they're trying to
outpoint each other and you're like,

4444
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:34,723
let's go wander.

4445
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:35,840
And you just go wander.

4446
01:50:35,841 --> 01:50:36,830
You could get a hot dog.

4447
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:38,360
We put him into a Maynard's,

4448
01:50:38,510 --> 01:50:39,690
which is like jolly rancher,

4449
01:50:39,691 --> 01:50:39,920
like,

4450
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:40,610
like gummy,

4451
01:50:40,610 --> 01:50:41,330
whatever.

4452
01:50:41,330 --> 01:50:44,180
We'd stick them in there so you could
reach farther and Maynard or you reach in

4453
01:50:44,181 --> 01:50:46,220
there and you feel something crunchy
like a stick and you're like,

4454
01:50:46,221 --> 01:50:46,641
okay,

4455
01:50:46,641 --> 01:50:47,301
I'm going for that.

4456
01:50:47,301 --> 01:50:49,010
We just keep eating these mushrooms.

4457
01:50:49,370 --> 01:50:50,840
Some random dudes were like,

4458
01:50:51,230 --> 01:50:52,010
hey,

4459
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:54,020
you want to come fucking to our skybox?

4460
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:57,510
And so we went to some skybox for awhile
until we got kicked out by security and

4461
01:50:57,511 --> 01:50:57,930
that was fun.

4462
01:50:57,930 --> 01:51:00,590
Like there's go as we were
great fucking giant pupils.

4463
01:51:02,090 --> 01:51:05,780
I saw a fucking security guard in
Calgary as we were going in and already

4464
01:51:05,781 --> 01:51:07,610
tripping and trying to smuggle these,

4465
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:09,710
these mushrooms in
there and this guy goes,

4466
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:10,753
hey man,

4467
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:11,660
happy shroom fest.

4468
01:51:11,661 --> 01:51:12,460
And I was like,

4469
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:12,980
oh,

4470
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:13,320
okay.

4471
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:14,230
You're being cool about it.

4472
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:16,580
Like you know about it and you're
letting me go like thank you very much.

4473
01:51:16,581 --> 01:51:17,430
Security officer.

4474
01:51:17,431 --> 01:51:19,130
I knew about shrooms was like a cop,

4475
01:51:19,790 --> 01:51:21,110
one of those that they hire there.

4476
01:51:21,170 --> 01:51:21,561
It kind of,

4477
01:51:21,561 --> 01:51:23,150
Calgary was fun.

4478
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:24,320
Calgary's great,

4479
01:51:24,830 --> 01:51:25,663
great city.

4480
01:51:26,030 --> 01:51:26,630
Yeah,

4481
01:51:26,630 --> 01:51:27,100
doing,

4482
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:28,850
doing that during the edibles.

4483
01:51:28,851 --> 01:51:32,060
I remember Alex Jones being there once
in d has given him a cookie and it goes

4484
01:51:32,061 --> 01:51:32,351
right.

4485
01:51:32,351 --> 01:51:32,571
He goes,

4486
01:51:32,571 --> 01:51:32,751
hey,

4487
01:51:32,751 --> 01:51:33,380
this cookie.

4488
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:33,681
Yeah.

4489
01:51:33,681 --> 01:51:34,760
And Alex Jones is like,

4490
01:51:34,761 --> 01:51:35,301
what's in the cookie?

4491
01:51:35,301 --> 01:51:36,740
And Diaz eat the fucking cookie.

4492
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:37,880
Like,

4493
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:39,200
like what kind of stupid question is that?

4494
01:51:39,201 --> 01:51:39,860
You know what's in there?

4495
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:40,940
We went to eat with him afterwards.

4496
01:51:40,941 --> 01:51:42,500
He was barbecued barbecue,

4497
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:43,820
much more reasonable back then.

4498
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:45,553
I never,

4499
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:50,830
I never understood how they made him
from crazy conspiracy theorists to alter

4500
01:51:52,611 --> 01:51:53,444
[inaudible].

4501
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:54,740
I didn't get the connection there.

4502
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:55,560
Well

4503
01:51:55,560 --> 01:52:00,090
that connection happened when he became
United with like Alex Jones became

4504
01:52:00,091 --> 01:52:01,320
United with Donald Trump.

4505
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:02,190
Right?

4506
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:02,341
Like,

4507
01:52:02,341 --> 01:52:04,370
cause he was a big part
of Donald Trump in,

4508
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:05,790
in the campaign days,

4509
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:08,130
Donald Trump would call in,

4510
01:52:08,670 --> 01:52:12,930
he would call into info wars and he knew
that Alex Jones had a big base and Alex

4511
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:13,860
Jones would help them get elected.

4512
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:14,970
You know,

4513
01:52:14,970 --> 01:52:15,803
Donald Trump,

4514
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:16,860
it's very clever.

4515
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:18,450
And who he aligns himself with.

4516
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:22,230
Like when you see him standing
there listening to Kanye West,

4517
01:52:22,231 --> 01:52:27,231
what Kanye West is ranting and saying all
this crazy fucking skitzo nonsense and

4518
01:52:27,241 --> 01:52:27,930
he's like this,

4519
01:52:27,930 --> 01:52:28,480
hmm.

4520
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,313
That's a smart cookie.

4521
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:31,080
He's very smart.

4522
01:52:31,081 --> 01:52:33,540
And when he calls bullshit and
when he doesn't call bullshit,

4523
01:52:33,570 --> 01:52:34,403
you know what I'm saying?

4524
01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:34,880
Yeah.

4525
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:35,280
It's like,

4526
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:39,930
imagine if Kanye West was debating him
and they were doing a presidential debate

4527
01:52:39,931 --> 01:52:41,100
and Kanye was talking like that.

4528
01:52:41,101 --> 01:52:41,431
It'd be like,

4529
01:52:41,431 --> 01:52:43,590
what the fuck is this guy saying?

4530
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:44,810
What are you saying?

4531
01:52:44,810 --> 01:52:46,100
Give enough for me so I'll let you talk.

4532
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:47,083
Yeah,

4533
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:48,103
he's,

4534
01:52:48,290 --> 01:52:48,890
you know,

4535
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:53,350
I just don't get how stones what it was
because he would have him on a bunch.

4536
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:53,961
Well,

4537
01:52:53,961 --> 01:52:54,231
you know,

4538
01:52:54,231 --> 01:52:57,170
also out outright wasn't
a thing back then.

4539
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,033
You got to realize when,

4540
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:00,340
when Alex came with us to,

4541
01:53:00,410 --> 01:53:01,243
to the fights,

4542
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:02,660
that was no outright,

4543
01:53:02,661 --> 01:53:03,830
but he was more like lizard.

4544
01:53:03,831 --> 01:53:05,150
People are like are like,

4545
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:05,361
oh,

4546
01:53:05,361 --> 01:53:07,100
it's a fucking government conspiracy.

4547
01:53:07,370 --> 01:53:07,521
Yeah.

4548
01:53:07,521 --> 01:53:11,150
He was all about don't get him started
on nine 11 it's like he was all about

4549
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:12,740
certain conspiracies.

4550
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:15,730
I remember we were in Austin once
when there was a shooting at a,

4551
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:17,660
at an army base.

4552
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:19,880
We were there right with him.

4553
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:23,210
When the thing went out about
and we were at a bar that goes,

4554
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:25,820
I guarantee you they're
not taking that guy alive.

4555
01:53:25,850 --> 01:53:26,990
I guarantee they won't let him talk.

4556
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:28,100
And then an hour later,

4557
01:53:28,101 --> 01:53:28,870
like they got them alive,

4558
01:53:28,870 --> 01:53:30,590
the shot him in the leg or they
got them alive because yeah,

4559
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:33,050
of course it got him a lot because they
want them to be a fucking martyr for

4560
01:53:33,051 --> 01:53:34,580
this thing and it's like or whatever.

4561
01:53:34,890 --> 01:53:35,720
It's going to be Marta,

4562
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:35,961
right?

4563
01:53:35,961 --> 01:53:36,171
Yeah.

4564
01:53:36,171 --> 01:53:37,970
And it's like no matter what,

4565
01:53:37,971 --> 01:53:38,391
he's just,

4566
01:53:38,391 --> 01:53:41,150
I'm spinning this to
conspiracy and then I just,

4567
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,950
that business is a tricky business.

4568
01:53:42,951 --> 01:53:43,650
I just don't,

4569
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:44,590
I don't think I said like,

4570
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:44,771
no,

4571
01:53:44,771 --> 01:53:45,950
you've got to be off the air now.

4572
01:53:45,951 --> 01:53:46,460
And it's like,

4573
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:49,070
well that's where it's fucked up.

4574
01:53:49,071 --> 01:53:50,540
It just elicit person guy.

4575
01:53:50,610 --> 01:53:51,800
Well it's not though,

4576
01:53:51,801 --> 01:53:56,750
because like people were concerned
that you're giving out bad information.

4577
01:53:56,751 --> 01:53:57,170
Right.

4578
01:53:57,170 --> 01:53:58,400
And they're concerned about it.

4579
01:53:58,401 --> 01:54:00,020
But then with Alex,

4580
01:54:00,050 --> 01:54:02,270
what came out was the sandy hook thing,

4581
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:04,160
the Sandy Hook denial thing.

4582
01:54:04,330 --> 01:54:05,330
It was when again,

4583
01:54:05,331 --> 01:54:05,961
conspiracy,

4584
01:54:05,961 --> 01:54:06,910
I don't get why that's right.

4585
01:54:06,911 --> 01:54:10,100
But it was a conspiracy involving
children being murdered and their parents

4586
01:54:10,101 --> 01:54:11,480
being actors.

4587
01:54:11,690 --> 01:54:14,720
And then everyone was like some sort of
a crisis actor and they were hired by

4588
01:54:14,721 --> 01:54:16,310
the government to take away people's guns.

4589
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:17,010
This is,

4590
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:19,970
this is the most radical
version of shirts.

4591
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:22,850
I understand and I understand
that that's wrong and crazy.

4592
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:26,000
Where do you get from there to,

4593
01:54:26,001 --> 01:54:27,680
you can't be allowed to say these crazy.

4594
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:29,660
You've been saying these
made up things before,

4595
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:30,140
right?

4596
01:54:30,140 --> 01:54:31,310
You're saying it's still,

4597
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:32,481
what's a free,

4598
01:54:32,481 --> 01:54:33,860
I don't get why it's a hate monger.

4599
01:54:33,890 --> 01:54:34,970
You got a really good argument.

4600
01:54:34,971 --> 01:54:35,930
But here's the argument.

4601
01:54:35,931 --> 01:54:39,080
The argument is what is Facebook?

4602
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:40,940
What is Twitter?

4603
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:42,260
What is Youtube?

4604
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:44,060
Are they private companies?

4605
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:45,320
Mercer,

4606
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:45,831
most certainly,

4607
01:54:45,831 --> 01:54:48,560
or even more so are they utilities?

4608
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:50,330
Is it like the electricity?

4609
01:54:50,510 --> 01:54:51,740
Is it like a phone?

4610
01:54:51,930 --> 01:54:54,290
Like what should you be
allowed to tell someone?

4611
01:54:54,291 --> 01:54:55,124
They can't use it?

4612
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:57,680
Like I wonder if Jack said,

4613
01:54:57,681 --> 01:54:57,831
Hey,

4614
01:54:57,831 --> 01:54:58,730
I'm shutting down Twitter.

4615
01:54:58,760 --> 01:54:59,540
If the government is like,

4616
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:00,530
we're opening it back up again.

4617
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:00,860
Right?

4618
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:02,420
Or is it like NBC?

4619
01:55:02,990 --> 01:55:06,020
Cause if NBC is a private
company and Ari Shaffir says,

4620
01:55:06,021 --> 01:55:06,440
Hey,

4621
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:08,440
the lizard people are
eating kids and that's,

4622
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:10,100
that's death to run 60 minutes.

4623
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:10,791
And they say,

4624
01:55:10,791 --> 01:55:10,931
no,

4625
01:55:10,931 --> 01:55:10,991
no,

4626
01:55:10,991 --> 01:55:11,180
no,

4627
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:11,451
our,

4628
01:55:11,451 --> 01:55:12,284
you're fired.

4629
01:55:12,550 --> 01:55:13,101
Like Bro,

4630
01:55:13,101 --> 01:55:17,120
Zan made one fucking bad ambien
joke and they canceled her.

4631
01:55:17,330 --> 01:55:18,290
They kicked her off of,

4632
01:55:18,291 --> 01:55:19,124
uh,

4633
01:55:19,730 --> 01:55:19,960
for,

4634
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:20,793
for any other reason.

4635
01:55:21,610 --> 01:55:22,070
They were,

4636
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:22,670
they weren't,

4637
01:55:22,670 --> 01:55:23,503
that's not true.

4638
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,820
Why do you say that show was a huge hit?

4639
01:55:25,850 --> 01:55:28,220
Because of the outrage over the
first season when she was like,

4640
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:29,090
she supports Trump.

4641
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:29,511
Yeah,

4642
01:55:29,511 --> 01:55:32,090
but there was a giant hit,

4643
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:36,260
but they were looking to get rid of her
at this whole group was already saying,

4644
01:55:36,261 --> 01:55:36,921
we want you out.

4645
01:55:36,921 --> 01:55:37,671
We're looking for an excuse.

4646
01:55:37,671 --> 01:55:41,420
Kind of like when they got rid of
you at the comedy store over filming,

4647
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:42,553
when it was like,

4648
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:43,650
come on.

4649
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,240
They already wanted to get rid of you.

4650
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:46,853
Well,

4651
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:49,050
and then they found an
excuse to get it done.

4652
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:53,880
That's a tricky argument
because they wanted her so bad.

4653
01:55:53,881 --> 01:55:54,690
They wanted her out.

4654
01:55:54,690 --> 01:55:56,960
I think they wanted to minimize her paid.

4655
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:58,350
That's true.

4656
01:55:58,350 --> 01:56:02,070
But she was telling me how they were
changing the way they were writing things

4657
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:06,360
and they weren't including her in the
process where she was very much included

4658
01:56:06,361 --> 01:56:09,360
in the process during the first season
when they were writing for the second

4659
01:56:09,361 --> 01:56:09,870
season.

4660
01:56:09,870 --> 01:56:13,620
They were there basically excluding her
from the process of premises and the way

4661
01:56:13,621 --> 01:56:14,820
they were writing the show.

4662
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:15,060
I mean,

4663
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:15,660
I read,

4664
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:18,330
I read all the outrage
about early on it was like,

4665
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:19,470
you're a Trump supporter.

4666
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:20,940
And I read,

4667
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:23,640
I saw someone like Ray Sani,

4668
01:56:23,641 --> 01:56:26,330
some young female comedian
going like it when,

4669
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:26,780
when,

4670
01:56:26,780 --> 01:56:28,050
when Silverman was like,

4671
01:56:28,051 --> 01:56:28,231
Hey,

4672
01:56:28,231 --> 01:56:29,840
watch my friends show Rosanne.

4673
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:30,480
She's great,

4674
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:30,921
great show.

4675
01:56:30,921 --> 01:56:31,210
And she goes,

4676
01:56:31,210 --> 01:56:31,330
no,

4677
01:56:31,330 --> 01:56:33,720
this is the bitch I got to be fake with
at a party and kissed her on the cheek,

4678
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:34,680
pretend I'm cool with her.

4679
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:36,083
And it's like,

4680
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:38,670
what is all this outrage
over this pro Trump thing?

4681
01:56:38,671 --> 01:56:39,091
And I finally,

4682
01:56:39,091 --> 01:56:39,271
I'm like,

4683
01:56:39,271 --> 01:56:40,104
let me go watch it.

4684
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:41,453
And my friend,

4685
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:45,690
Jewish female leftist
Morgan Murphy who wrote it,

4686
01:56:46,180 --> 01:56:46,530
uh,

4687
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:47,580
I talked to her later about it,

4688
01:56:47,581 --> 01:56:48,540
but I finally watched it.

4689
01:56:48,541 --> 01:56:50,940
And it's this 12 characters in the show,

4690
01:56:51,690 --> 01:56:54,270
10 of them don't talk about
who they voted for it all.

4691
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:55,590
One of them is pro Trump,

4692
01:56:55,870 --> 01:56:56,570
anti Trump.

4693
01:56:56,570 --> 01:56:59,130
It's also a little trans
kid on there and that's it.

4694
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:00,300
Just one pro Trump,

4695
01:57:00,301 --> 01:57:02,640
one anti anti-Trump and the outrage dies.

4696
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:04,110
Saw was almost like,

4697
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:07,140
I don't think you guys could've
possibly watch this episode.

4698
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:10,080
I think you're all reading
headlines about stories.

4699
01:57:10,590 --> 01:57:11,770
And that's what I talked
to Morgan about it.

4700
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:12,613
I'm like,

4701
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:16,140
it doesn't seem like it could
have come from the actual facts,

4702
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:17,063
you know,

4703
01:57:17,550 --> 01:57:18,930
there was a lot of that going on.

4704
01:57:18,930 --> 01:57:19,620
Right?

4705
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:20,070
Yeah.

4706
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:20,730
And so I,

4707
01:57:20,730 --> 01:57:22,950
I feel like it's the same
thing with Alex Jones.

4708
01:57:22,951 --> 01:57:23,850
I'm going hate monitor.

4709
01:57:23,851 --> 01:57:24,510
I'm like,

4710
01:57:24,510 --> 01:57:24,961
what?

4711
01:57:24,961 --> 01:57:26,070
Alex Jones,

4712
01:57:26,490 --> 01:57:28,080
just crazy conspiracy guy.

4713
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:29,093
Most of it.

4714
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:29,550
Yeah.

4715
01:57:29,550 --> 01:57:31,050
Most of the hate monger.

4716
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:31,471
Well,

4717
01:57:31,471 --> 01:57:32,130
yeah.

4718
01:57:32,130 --> 01:57:32,520
Um,

4719
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:35,220
do you talk about taking away
trans rights or anything like that?

4720
01:57:35,221 --> 01:57:36,780
Doing some talk?

4721
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:40,050
There was some talk Alex Jones
was saying and one of the,

4722
01:57:40,051 --> 01:57:41,850
one of the last final straws,

4723
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:46,410
it was talking about people taking up
arms and that people are not going to

4724
01:57:46,411 --> 01:57:47,131
stand it.

4725
01:57:47,131 --> 01:57:47,461
And you know,

4726
01:57:47,461 --> 01:57:47,671
it's,

4727
01:57:47,671 --> 01:57:49,740
it's basically rabble rousing,

4728
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:53,730
which is like a lot of what people do
when they're there talking about the other

4729
01:57:53,731 --> 01:57:54,181
side,

4730
01:57:54,181 --> 01:57:55,290
trying to take away your rights,

4731
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:56,730
trying to take away your guns.

4732
01:57:56,850 --> 01:57:57,810
We're not gonna stand for it.

4733
01:57:58,060 --> 01:57:58,540
You know,

4734
01:57:58,540 --> 01:58:01,290
you know people are going to get shot,

4735
01:58:01,410 --> 01:58:02,790
you know that kind of talk.

4736
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:03,361
I mean,

4737
01:58:03,361 --> 01:58:05,670
I don't know specifically what he said,

4738
01:58:05,671 --> 01:58:08,520
but this is a problem that
you don't know specifically.

4739
01:58:08,670 --> 01:58:09,180
Right.

4740
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:13,230
There's a problem that they
can just decide that you
represent a certain faction

4741
01:58:13,231 --> 01:58:17,220
of thought and that this
should be eliminated from,

4742
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:21,990
you should be deep platformed instead
like the platform for a conspiracy guy and

4743
01:58:21,991 --> 01:58:22,260
they go,

4744
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:25,380
people are going up to those those parents
and saying like your kid's not dead.

4745
01:58:25,650 --> 01:58:26,520
And it's like a real issue.

4746
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:26,641
Yeah,

4747
01:58:26,641 --> 01:58:28,380
but it's like he's not calling for that.

4748
01:58:28,381 --> 01:58:30,000
That's what they're doing on their own.

4749
01:58:30,590 --> 01:58:33,860
Somebody shot two cops in New York because
of the black lives matter movement.

4750
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:35,970
You don't shut down the black
lives matter movement over that.

4751
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:38,130
They weren't asking
for them to shoot cops.

4752
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:40,200
Someone did on their own who was also an,

4753
01:58:40,201 --> 01:58:41,630
he was an avenue to do that,

4754
01:58:41,631 --> 01:58:42,100
right?

4755
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:42,251
No,

4756
01:58:42,251 --> 01:58:42,820
he wasn't.

4757
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:43,450
So like,

4758
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:46,690
so like I don't see how you deep plat for
the only great article I read was by a

4759
01:58:46,691 --> 01:58:47,530
trans woman who said,

4760
01:58:47,531 --> 01:58:49,030
when I hear crazy shit like that,

4761
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:52,150
I feel like it's supposed to roll
your eyes and then walk away.

4762
01:58:52,630 --> 01:58:53,350
You don't say,

4763
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:53,531
Hey,

4764
01:58:53,531 --> 01:58:54,460
you need to get gone.

4765
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:56,933
Well,

4766
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:58,190
you know,

4767
01:58:58,190 --> 01:58:59,330
d platforming people,

4768
01:58:59,331 --> 01:59:00,260
that's a good way to put it,

4769
01:59:00,290 --> 01:59:00,651
dad.

4770
01:59:00,651 --> 01:59:01,580
That is what they're saying.

4771
01:59:01,581 --> 01:59:02,630
And it's also,

4772
01:59:02,631 --> 01:59:06,200
it seemed like it was a universal d
platforming because Twitter was the one of

4773
01:59:06,201 --> 01:59:07,850
the last places that kept him on.

4774
01:59:08,150 --> 01:59:10,460
And then they decided that
they were going to remove him,

4775
01:59:10,610 --> 01:59:12,620
but I didn't see anything specifically.

4776
01:59:12,650 --> 01:59:13,870
Cause yeah,

4777
01:59:13,910 --> 01:59:14,211
I like,

4778
01:59:14,211 --> 01:59:15,590
they have some rules
like that when they got,

4779
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:16,453
um,

4780
01:59:16,790 --> 01:59:20,870
who's a woman that was Rose McGowan and
then she was claim talking about a rape

4781
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:21,561
and people are like,

4782
01:59:21,561 --> 01:59:22,161
how dare you,

4783
01:59:22,161 --> 01:59:22,460
she,

4784
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:22,781
she,

4785
01:59:22,781 --> 01:59:23,090
she,

4786
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:24,260
she out of the rape and then,

4787
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:27,740
and then a u d platform or from Matt
or you just took it out from that?

4788
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:28,540
Um,

4789
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:29,301
and that was the story.

4790
01:59:29,301 --> 01:59:29,901
That was a headline.

4791
01:59:29,901 --> 01:59:30,291
Everyone's like,

4792
01:59:30,291 --> 01:59:31,250
how dare you Jack,

4793
01:59:31,251 --> 01:59:32,084
is that the guy from Twitter?

4794
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:32,631
Jack Dorsey?

4795
01:59:32,631 --> 01:59:32,750
Yeah.

4796
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:33,110
Yeah.

4797
01:59:33,110 --> 01:59:33,591
How dare you.

4798
01:59:33,591 --> 01:59:34,930
And then he actually responded.

4799
01:59:34,931 --> 01:59:35,110
He goes,

4800
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:35,291
oh no,

4801
01:59:35,291 --> 01:59:35,371
no,

4802
01:59:35,371 --> 01:59:35,810
no.

4803
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:36,770
She docked somebody's,

4804
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:40,100
she gave somebody information about
where they live and stuff like that.

4805
01:59:40,101 --> 01:59:40,551
And that's,

4806
01:59:40,551 --> 01:59:41,450
we already had that role.

4807
01:59:41,451 --> 01:59:42,284
You can't do that.

4808
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:42,441
Right?

4809
01:59:42,441 --> 01:59:44,540
Nothing to do with why she dox them.

4810
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:44,760
Well,

4811
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:45,120
let's,

4812
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:46,310
let's just over that,

4813
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:51,050
why don't you Google what exactly
got Alex Jones kicked off Twitter?

4814
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:52,553
Cause he would,

4815
01:59:52,670 --> 01:59:57,670
Twitter was one of the last platforms and
then they can say hate speech and hate

4816
01:59:58,281 --> 01:59:59,580
speech is one of those weird,

4817
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:00,260
broad,

4818
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:01,280
broad terms.

4819
02:00:01,410 --> 02:00:02,243
It's like I hate you.

4820
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:03,253
Yeah.

4821
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:04,273
Okay.

4822
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:05,500
Yeah,

4823
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:05,891
I mean I,

4824
02:00:05,891 --> 02:00:06,910
I really am like,

4825
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:07,600
I don't,

4826
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:12,600
I think people are forgetting how the
ACL you defended the Klan members because

4827
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:14,530
the free speech is too big.

4828
02:00:14,540 --> 02:00:14,820
Uh,

4829
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:15,010
uh,

4830
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:15,660
uh,

4831
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:19,690
a fucking issue to worry about how
I feel about what they're saying.

4832
02:00:19,810 --> 02:00:19,961
Well,

4833
02:00:19,961 --> 02:00:23,140
you know what's really interesting
is that left leaning people,

4834
02:00:23,141 --> 02:00:27,850
the leftists are the ones that want to
censor and d platform and silence people

4835
02:00:27,851 --> 02:00:28,330
on the right.

4836
02:00:28,330 --> 02:00:28,721
It is.

4837
02:00:28,721 --> 02:00:29,441
It's also both.

4838
02:00:29,441 --> 02:00:30,920
I think we see the left more cause word,

4839
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:31,540
that bubble.

4840
02:00:31,540 --> 02:00:32,620
I think it goes the right is doing it.

4841
02:00:32,621 --> 02:00:33,071
So we just don't,

4842
02:00:33,071 --> 02:00:33,800
we're not friends with her.

4843
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:34,481
The white doing it.

4844
02:00:34,481 --> 02:00:35,030
They have no,

4845
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:38,500
no power in technology
that the tech companies,

4846
02:00:38,501 --> 02:00:39,370
whether it's Facebook,

4847
02:00:39,371 --> 02:00:39,851
Google,

4848
02:00:39,851 --> 02:00:40,300
Twitter,

4849
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:41,260
they're all left.

4850
02:00:41,290 --> 02:00:41,800
Yeah.

4851
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:43,370
And they're the ones who have the mean.

4852
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:44,350
This is where it's weird.

4853
02:00:44,351 --> 02:00:45,184
Right.

4854
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:46,510
It's because nobody saw this coming.

4855
02:00:46,510 --> 02:00:47,620
It was media.

4856
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:49,180
Like you had Fox News,

4857
02:00:49,181 --> 02:00:50,140
you had NBC,

4858
02:00:50,141 --> 02:00:50,500
you had,

4859
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:51,970
you had your left and you had your right.

4860
02:00:52,150 --> 02:00:54,040
More left than right of sure.

4861
02:00:54,220 --> 02:00:56,590
But there was power in the Fox News,

4862
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:57,520
you know,

4863
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:58,120
faction,

4864
02:00:58,120 --> 02:00:59,140
they had their voice.

4865
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:00,640
But in the,

4866
02:01:00,641 --> 02:01:01,030
in,

4867
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:02,380
when it comes to technology,

4868
02:01:02,381 --> 02:01:05,740
there's not really an equivalent
or commensurate company.

4869
02:01:05,790 --> 02:01:06,700
It's all left.

4870
02:01:06,701 --> 02:01:06,940
Yeah.

4871
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:07,960
It's all left.

4872
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:12,700
There's not one right leaning
large social media platform.

4873
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:13,330
Right.

4874
02:01:13,330 --> 02:01:14,260
They don't exist.

4875
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:15,500
It should just stay out of it.

4876
02:01:15,501 --> 02:01:15,581
But,

4877
02:01:15,581 --> 02:01:15,761
but I,

4878
02:01:15,761 --> 02:01:16,560
I get why they,

4879
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:16,860
you're getting,

4880
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:18,070
you gotta read it
situation where it's like,

4881
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:18,311
okay,

4882
02:01:18,311 --> 02:01:23,230
but suddenly it devolved into
just child porn will read it.

4883
02:01:23,231 --> 02:01:27,460
The problem with Reddit is an anonymity
when you give people anonymity and one

4884
02:01:27,461 --> 02:01:31,180
guy actually lost his job because
of it because somebody decided,

4885
02:01:31,181 --> 02:01:31,271
hey,

4886
02:01:31,271 --> 02:01:33,520
this guy is such a fucking
creep piece of shit.

4887
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:35,020
Let's find out who the fuck he is.

4888
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:38,500
And he got his Ip and then they figured
out who he was and then he was like some

4889
02:01:38,501 --> 02:01:39,710
guy who is a dad,

4890
02:01:39,810 --> 02:01:40,040
right?

4891
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,510
It was like some regular guy with a
job and they got him fire and like,

4892
02:01:42,820 --> 02:01:43,560
you know,

4893
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,140
he had a bunch of weird,

4894
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:46,153
you know,

4895
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,620
kid fucking type posts and

4896
02:01:48,940 --> 02:01:50,200
a bunch of shit that just people,

4897
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:53,860
it's almost like role playing
where it's like you're not serious.

4898
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:54,550
Exactly.

4899
02:01:54,550 --> 02:01:59,320
And it's all said [inaudible] people
were running out of the room yesterday or

4900
02:01:59,321 --> 02:01:59,891
two days ago.

4901
02:01:59,891 --> 02:02:02,200
He got a full room randomly
the end of the night.

4902
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:03,110
Yeah.

4903
02:02:03,110 --> 02:02:04,670
He spent his first three minutes like,

4904
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:06,093
oh,

4905
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:07,030
it's cable.

4906
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:07,580
Oh No,

4907
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:07,901
it's due.

4908
02:02:07,901 --> 02:02:09,160
I never got up out of this many people,

4909
02:02:09,161 --> 02:02:10,240
like he couldn't handle it.

4910
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:11,351
And then he starts going,

4911
02:02:11,351 --> 02:02:13,900
they start leaving and he starts
getting angry and born to his pocket,

4912
02:02:13,901 --> 02:02:14,141
you know,

4913
02:02:14,141 --> 02:02:15,250
into where he's belongs.

4914
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:18,640
And that asks people to leave in like
he's talking about child fucking and stuff

4915
02:02:18,641 --> 02:02:19,090
like that.

4916
02:02:19,090 --> 02:02:19,923
And uh,

4917
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:21,033
and um,

4918
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:24,100
it was a peek behind the curtain.

4919
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:25,720
I didn't fuck a baby,

4920
02:02:27,190 --> 02:02:27,850
just so you know,

4921
02:02:27,850 --> 02:02:28,840
there were no babies fucked.

4922
02:02:29,710 --> 02:02:30,543
So calm down.

4923
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:31,841
Well,

4924
02:02:31,841 --> 02:02:34,390
people don't want to hear about
that subject and that's fair.

4925
02:02:34,690 --> 02:02:35,890
That's to the comedy store.

4926
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:38,680
Do your some wonderful jokes about
people losing socks in the dryer.

4927
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:38,891
Right?

4928
02:02:38,891 --> 02:02:39,401
So actually,

4929
02:02:39,401 --> 02:02:40,690
honestly walking out,

4930
02:02:40,691 --> 02:02:41,590
is it fine response?

4931
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:42,130
Yeah.

4932
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:43,480
Saying he can't go up anymore.

4933
02:02:43,481 --> 02:02:47,110
It's not a fine response response and
saying you're going to boycott the comedy

4934
02:02:47,111 --> 02:02:49,070
store because they don't do
your kind of comedy and you,

4935
02:02:49,130 --> 02:02:50,140
if you want to boycott.

4936
02:02:50,141 --> 02:02:50,980
And that's also okay.

4937
02:02:50,981 --> 02:02:51,350
But yeah,

4938
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:52,520
just trying to get other people to

4939
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:53,640
all right.

4940
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:54,400
All right.

4941
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,940
But there's that,

4942
02:02:55,950 --> 02:03:00,370
this is a problem in
that there's no balance,

4943
02:03:00,430 --> 02:03:00,880
right?

4944
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:05,830
If people are just right leaning and
people want a deep plat form them because

4945
02:03:05,831 --> 02:03:07,300
they have right-leaning beliefs,

4946
02:03:07,301 --> 02:03:07,601
right.

4947
02:03:07,601 --> 02:03:10,720
Leaning ideas like say if
they support president Trump,

4948
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,280
I mean he is the president.

4949
02:03:12,281 --> 02:03:13,114
Whether you like it,

4950
02:03:13,390 --> 02:03:14,830
you're allowed to like it or not.

4951
02:03:14,831 --> 02:03:16,450
You want whether you like it or not,

4952
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:19,810
that guy's the president and when
do you like his policies or not?

4953
02:03:19,811 --> 02:03:20,890
They are his policies.

4954
02:03:20,891 --> 02:03:24,910
He's the president of the United States
and if someone supports that deep

4955
02:03:24,911 --> 02:03:29,080
platforming people who support him and
support that is not the right response.

4956
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:34,320
The right response is a well-worded
argument against that is against that.

4957
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:39,480
That is convincingly articulate
to the point where you,

4958
02:03:40,990 --> 02:03:44,440
you make an argument that
this is a terrible policy,

4959
02:03:44,441 --> 02:03:49,441
a terrible idea and an objective fence
rider like myself that watches that and

4960
02:03:49,451 --> 02:03:50,650
reads it might go,

4961
02:03:50,651 --> 02:03:50,981
okay,

4962
02:03:50,981 --> 02:03:51,741
this guy's got a good point.

4963
02:03:51,741 --> 02:03:52,080
Yeah,

4964
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:53,040
I want to hear both sides,

4965
02:03:53,041 --> 02:03:55,680
but I need to hear that side in
order to hear the alternative side,

4966
02:03:55,681 --> 02:03:57,570
like Dave Smith who hates all politicians,

4967
02:03:57,571 --> 02:03:58,404
pretty much,

4968
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:01,320
he was pointing out these like separating
their kids from their parents thing

4969
02:04:01,321 --> 02:04:01,681
and he's like,

4970
02:04:01,681 --> 02:04:03,240
it's gotten real bad with Trump now.

4971
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:03,931
And he goes,

4972
02:04:03,931 --> 02:04:04,231
okay,

4973
02:04:04,231 --> 02:04:04,950
that's true.

4974
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:07,260
But look at the picture they're using
on the bottom right hand corner.

4975
02:04:07,261 --> 02:04:10,020
There's a date stamp on
it and it's 2014 yeah,

4976
02:04:10,021 --> 02:04:11,460
there's definitely a lot of shenanigans.

4977
02:04:11,461 --> 02:04:12,160
So like your,

4978
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,920
your anger is not even who,

4979
02:04:14,270 --> 02:04:15,750
I can't even bring that up.

4980
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:18,600
Elysium the what that is and,

4981
02:04:18,601 --> 02:04:21,030
and online journalism look,

4982
02:04:21,260 --> 02:04:23,770
journalism my fucking fighting for
their lives right down back there.

4983
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:24,950
And it's terrible.

4984
02:04:24,951 --> 02:04:25,784
It's terrible.

4985
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:26,601
And it's also,

4986
02:04:26,601 --> 02:04:27,500
there's no money in it.

4987
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:30,800
There's a problem is nobody wants to buy
newspapers and we want to buy magazines

4988
02:04:30,801 --> 02:04:35,730
and it's really hard for online journalism
to not resort clicktale anger shit.

4989
02:04:35,900 --> 02:04:36,200
Yeah.

4990
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:39,000
I mean that's literally how they make
their living now as click bait shit.

4991
02:04:39,330 --> 02:04:39,950
And so,

4992
02:04:39,950 --> 02:04:40,170
you know,

4993
02:04:40,170 --> 02:04:40,921
they have a photo.

4994
02:04:40,921 --> 02:04:42,030
This is what the stock photo.

4995
02:04:42,031 --> 02:04:45,450
We got a little fucking kid who's crying
and he's standing in front of a border

4996
02:04:45,451 --> 02:04:46,110
patrol guy,

4997
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:46,943
throw it up,

4998
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:49,500
use it is what we got the stories real.

4999
02:04:49,501 --> 02:04:50,370
The photo's not,

5000
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:51,960
it's it's Shit Journal.

5001
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:55,520
I think it really comes down to like
when you see like a norm McDonald where

5002
02:04:55,521 --> 02:04:55,850
it's like,

5003
02:04:55,850 --> 02:04:56,091
okay,

5004
02:04:56,091 --> 02:04:58,880
I haven't done anything to anybody wrong.

5005
02:04:59,690 --> 02:05:02,270
I just want to look at with
compassionate and other human.

5006
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:02,691
I'm like,

5007
02:05:02,691 --> 02:05:03,140
these are p,

5008
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:03,973
there's a friends of mine.

5009
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:04,820
The people I know.

5010
02:05:04,820 --> 02:05:05,350
What do you mean?

5011
02:05:05,350 --> 02:05:07,190
Just be specific what you're
saying about norm Macdonald.

5012
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:11,150
He said like Roseanne and Louie and
like they'd lost everything in a day and

5013
02:05:11,151 --> 02:05:12,590
people don't really
understand what it's like.

5014
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:12,980
Right.

5015
02:05:12,980 --> 02:05:15,020
And I would like to see these friends,

5016
02:05:15,021 --> 02:05:16,070
human beings,

5017
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:18,500
friends of mine come up
with a way and he goes,

5018
02:05:18,501 --> 02:05:18,831
honestly,

5019
02:05:18,831 --> 02:05:20,300
I don't think Rosanne
who that lady was black.

5020
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:21,800
I don't think she makes that comment.

5021
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:22,671
And then people go,

5022
02:05:22,671 --> 02:05:23,504
fuck you.

5023
02:05:23,740 --> 02:05:24,140
You're can't.

5024
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:25,720
Your tonight show appearance is canceled.

5025
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:27,051
And it's like,

5026
02:05:27,051 --> 02:05:28,220
why do you even do anything?

5027
02:05:28,340 --> 02:05:29,750
When we tell him he didn't do anything,

5028
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:31,970
instead of taking that opportunity to go,

5029
02:05:32,510 --> 02:05:32,841
hey,

5030
02:05:32,841 --> 02:05:33,620
let's hear him out.

5031
02:05:33,620 --> 02:05:35,180
Maybe you can clarify what you mean,

5032
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:36,333
right?

5033
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:36,951
Even say,

5034
02:05:36,951 --> 02:05:37,161
no,

5035
02:05:37,161 --> 02:05:38,270
I didn't mean it that way.

5036
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:39,200
The platform,

5037
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:39,891
the platform,

5038
02:05:39,891 --> 02:05:41,360
cause he's women or people,

5039
02:05:41,361 --> 02:05:44,900
I don't really know who they were at the
tonight show had their opportunity to

5040
02:05:44,901 --> 02:05:46,370
fall on their sword and they go,

5041
02:05:46,371 --> 02:05:49,130
now we get to stand up for women's
rights and we get to stand up for racial

5042
02:05:49,131 --> 02:05:51,590
rights instead of going like,

5043
02:05:51,591 --> 02:05:52,424
let's have him on,

5044
02:05:52,770 --> 02:05:53,810
have him on and say,

5045
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:55,130
Jimmy Fallon go,

5046
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:55,851
what?

5047
02:05:55,851 --> 02:05:56,511
What did you mean by that?

5048
02:05:56,511 --> 02:05:56,901
Exactly.

5049
02:05:56,901 --> 02:05:58,970
And then to clarify his
position to now show,

5050
02:05:59,060 --> 02:05:59,271
Oh,

5051
02:05:59,271 --> 02:06:00,170
I'm on your side,

5052
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:01,130
but people don't want that.

5053
02:06:01,131 --> 02:06:01,740
They're more interested.

5054
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:03,200
They're more interested in punishment.

5055
02:06:04,070 --> 02:06:07,880
And so now you're punishing people who
are on your side so you can feel right at

5056
02:06:07,881 --> 02:06:08,720
the comedy cellar.

5057
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:11,300
A waitress was traveling to fucking work,

5058
02:06:11,330 --> 02:06:12,140
wearing her comedy cell,

5059
02:06:12,140 --> 02:06:14,180
a t shirt off to Louis came
back and somebody said,

5060
02:06:14,181 --> 02:06:14,420
hey,

5061
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:14,990
headphones,

5062
02:06:14,990 --> 02:06:15,920
like take your headphones out.

5063
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:16,521
And she did.

5064
02:06:16,521 --> 02:06:16,761
She goes,

5065
02:06:16,761 --> 02:06:16,970
what?

5066
02:06:16,970 --> 02:06:17,360
And they go,

5067
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:18,260
shame on you.

5068
02:06:18,980 --> 02:06:20,210
To some waitress who by the way,

5069
02:06:20,211 --> 02:06:21,470
he's not in charge of him coming back.

5070
02:06:21,590 --> 02:06:25,010
She might've actually guy or girl
that said shame on you don't know.

5071
02:06:25,011 --> 02:06:25,844
I think a woman,

5072
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:26,953
I'm not sure,

5073
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:29,900
but this waitress might've been like
heavily against him coming back,

5074
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:31,880
but there's no research done.

5075
02:06:31,881 --> 02:06:32,390
It's just like,

5076
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:36,470
I get my chance to show that I've stuck
up for somebody instead of ruining some

5077
02:06:36,471 --> 02:06:38,840
other woman's Day who
might be on your side.

5078
02:06:38,910 --> 02:06:39,200
Yeah.

5079
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:42,140
Well this is one of the stuck a finger
in Val's face after he came back.

5080
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:43,303
Fuck you.

5081
02:06:43,580 --> 02:06:44,413
After they were leaving,

5082
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:46,400
that was one of the
managers of the seller.

5083
02:06:46,790 --> 02:06:47,540
And it's like,

5084
02:06:47,540 --> 02:06:50,780
so here's a fellow woman who
hasn't done anything wrong.

5085
02:06:51,110 --> 02:06:51,650
Right.

5086
02:06:51,650 --> 02:06:52,180
And you're,

5087
02:06:52,180 --> 02:06:52,650
you're,

5088
02:06:52,650 --> 02:06:56,210
you're cursing her out so you can feel
like I've done something for the cause.

5089
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:56,920
Yeah.

5090
02:06:56,920 --> 02:06:57,550
Well this is,

5091
02:06:57,550 --> 02:06:57,760
no,

5092
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:59,170
the left does that.

5093
02:06:59,171 --> 02:07:01,810
The right doesn't do the
left attacks its own.

5094
02:07:02,210 --> 02:07:02,460
Yeah.

5095
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:02,711
And they,

5096
02:07:02,711 --> 02:07:03,544
they attack.

5097
02:07:04,390 --> 02:07:05,350
Tina Fey once said,

5098
02:07:05,351 --> 02:07:06,520
your antifeminist and she was like,

5099
02:07:06,521 --> 02:07:08,140
you're out of your
fucking mind about what,

5100
02:07:08,141 --> 02:07:08,351
five,

5101
02:07:08,351 --> 02:07:09,071
six years ago,

5102
02:07:09,071 --> 02:07:09,611
I don't remember.

5103
02:07:09,611 --> 02:07:09,911
And she goes,

5104
02:07:09,911 --> 02:07:10,510
you out of your mind.

5105
02:07:10,510 --> 02:07:11,343
I'm your leader,

5106
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:12,910
I'm on your side.

5107
02:07:12,911 --> 02:07:14,740
You're attacking me
for being antifeminist.

5108
02:07:14,770 --> 02:07:16,180
You're out of your fucking mind.

5109
02:07:16,181 --> 02:07:16,841
They eat their own.

5110
02:07:16,841 --> 02:07:17,171
They can't.

5111
02:07:17,171 --> 02:07:18,730
They have blood loss and
they know how to control it.

5112
02:07:18,731 --> 02:07:20,400
You're not trained in fucking fighting.

5113
02:07:20,550 --> 02:07:20,701
Well,

5114
02:07:20,701 --> 02:07:22,320
they're always looking for targets.

5115
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:25,290
They're always looking for targets and
in finding and establishing a target,

5116
02:07:25,291 --> 02:07:29,070
you clearly establish that you are better
and more virtuous than that person.

5117
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:29,250
Right?

5118
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:31,470
Because you find a fence
in something that they do.

5119
02:07:31,471 --> 02:07:34,140
They're not progressive enough and
they are a part of the problem.

5120
02:07:34,350 --> 02:07:38,140
And so he cast them out or you
shut them down or you d platform.

5121
02:07:38,230 --> 02:07:38,501
Yeah,

5122
02:07:38,501 --> 02:07:39,670
so I think with Alex Jones,

5123
02:07:39,671 --> 02:07:40,080
they go,

5124
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:40,250
hey,

5125
02:07:40,250 --> 02:07:41,380
they pointed to that one a lot.

5126
02:07:41,381 --> 02:07:41,770
They're like,

5127
02:07:41,770 --> 02:07:42,130
dude,

5128
02:07:42,130 --> 02:07:44,320
he said fucking Sandy Hook didn't happen.

5129
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:45,363
And it's like,

5130
02:07:45,530 --> 02:07:46,001
okay,

5131
02:07:46,001 --> 02:07:46,570
I'm not,

5132
02:07:46,570 --> 02:07:47,320
I'm not saying I'm not.

5133
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:47,921
You've tried it.

5134
02:07:47,921 --> 02:07:49,990
Now I get Straw man me into saying,

5135
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:50,621
I'm saying,

5136
02:07:50,621 --> 02:07:51,880
that's okay or that's right.

5137
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:52,930
I'm not saying this right.

5138
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:55,150
I just don't see the connection to this.

5139
02:07:55,151 --> 02:07:57,820
I don't see the connection
to Michael Vick killing dogs,

5140
02:07:57,821 --> 02:07:59,350
which I'm not in the side of too.

5141
02:07:59,351 --> 02:08:00,550
You shouldn't play football.

5142
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:01,240
Right.

5143
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:02,970
You haven't made that
connection to me and be like,

5144
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:03,101
Oh,

5145
02:08:03,101 --> 02:08:04,270
you're saying it's okay to kill dogs?

5146
02:08:04,271 --> 02:08:05,104
Like no,

5147
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:07,360
it's just why is that job not allowed?

5148
02:08:07,361 --> 02:08:07,770
Yeah.

5149
02:08:07,770 --> 02:08:10,500
The connection would be if
you have a private company,

5150
02:08:11,130 --> 02:08:11,850
this is where we're,

5151
02:08:11,850 --> 02:08:13,380
we're all boils down to like,

5152
02:08:13,381 --> 02:08:18,381
do you have a right to use their platform
so you're not taking Alex Jones off

5153
02:08:18,721 --> 02:08:19,440
the Internet.

5154
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:19,741
Right.

5155
02:08:19,741 --> 02:08:21,750
Alex Jones still has this
website in the Internet,

5156
02:08:21,990 --> 02:08:22,823
but if you have,

5157
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:23,280
uh,

5158
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:28,080
if Ari should fear.com all
the sudden becomes Twitter.

5159
02:08:28,370 --> 02:08:29,080
Okay.

5160
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:29,370
There's,

5161
02:08:29,370 --> 02:08:30,290
there's a separate thing though.

5162
02:08:30,291 --> 02:08:30,891
Private company,

5163
02:08:30,891 --> 02:08:32,660
are they allowed and it's private company.

5164
02:08:32,690 --> 02:08:33,920
Should you be doing that?

5165
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:36,200
Should you be doing with the laws are,

5166
02:08:36,201 --> 02:08:37,760
I agree with only a portion of it.

5167
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:38,593
The laws,

5168
02:08:38,770 --> 02:08:39,603
you know,

5169
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:43,160
this is in response to like the cockpit
type of shit that has happened at reddit

5170
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:48,220
that reddit has gotten so fucking out
there in so many different ways and so

5171
02:08:48,651 --> 02:08:49,730
like that,

5172
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,010
especially the Trump section of reddit.

5173
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:52,460
Yeah.

5174
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:54,080
Like people let them be there.

5175
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:55,280
They're not doing anything to anybody.

5176
02:08:55,281 --> 02:08:56,390
They're not planning attacks.

5177
02:08:56,630 --> 02:08:58,310
But people who,

5178
02:08:58,370 --> 02:08:59,090
if you save,

5179
02:08:59,090 --> 02:09:04,090
you own that company and you were one
of the people that was responsible for

5180
02:09:04,191 --> 02:09:06,750
trying to sell ads for
Twitter or for whatever.

5181
02:09:06,850 --> 02:09:08,180
I don't think Twitter has ads,

5182
02:09:08,690 --> 02:09:11,960
but if you had like
established guidelines,

5183
02:09:11,961 --> 02:09:13,460
which you could and couldn't say,

5184
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,840
one of those things would
probably be no hate speech,

5185
02:09:17,841 --> 02:09:19,100
no racism,

5186
02:09:19,101 --> 02:09:19,821
no this,

5187
02:09:19,821 --> 02:09:20,654
no that.

5188
02:09:20,810 --> 02:09:25,810
But you can't promote false conspiracy
theories that hurt other people.

5189
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:26,980
Right.

5190
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:27,320
That you,

5191
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:29,030
you could get away with saying that.

5192
02:09:30,340 --> 02:09:31,173
Right?

5193
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:32,201
So it's not about,

5194
02:09:32,201 --> 02:09:33,001
so it's kind of like the,

5195
02:09:33,001 --> 02:09:33,280
the,

5196
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:33,700
the,

5197
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:35,330
the Rose McGowan thing where it's like,

5198
02:09:35,370 --> 02:09:35,651
oh no,

5199
02:09:35,651 --> 02:09:36,071
it's not about,

5200
02:09:36,071 --> 02:09:37,150
you just can't talk to anybody.

5201
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:37,781
What does this,

5202
02:09:37,781 --> 02:09:38,614
Jamie,

5203
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:43,570
this is from a NPR interview with a
Washington Post reporter about why,

5204
02:09:43,630 --> 02:09:44,350
what's read this?

5205
02:09:44,350 --> 02:09:44,800
It says,

5206
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:46,360
and when I spoke to somebody at Twitter,

5207
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:49,870
they said one thing that weighed very
heavily on them was the way that Jones

5208
02:09:49,871 --> 02:09:53,500
conducted himself outside of a
congressional hearing where Twitter CEO,

5209
02:09:53,501 --> 02:09:54,161
Jack Dorsey,

5210
02:09:54,161 --> 02:09:57,850
was testifying about the way the
company moderates content online.

5211
02:09:57,851 --> 02:09:58,201
Jones.

5212
02:09:58,201 --> 02:10:00,630
Specif essentially went after Republicans,

5213
02:10:00,631 --> 02:10:04,990
Senator Mark Marco Rubio interrupted
one of his press conferences.

5214
02:10:05,110 --> 02:10:09,010
He yelled at Dorsey at one point as he
was trying to leave the building and then

5215
02:10:09,011 --> 02:10:12,700
he live streamed the incident where
he was attacking a CNN reporter,

5216
02:10:12,730 --> 02:10:14,680
hurling verbal insults at him.

5217
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:16,990
The video was broadcast on periscope,

5218
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:21,310
which is the live streaming site owned
by Twitter and so in the minds of the

5219
02:10:21,311 --> 02:10:23,110
company and essentially was too much.

5220
02:10:23,170 --> 02:10:26,380
He had gone too far and so
they kicked him off the site.

5221
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:26,801
Yeah,

5222
02:10:26,801 --> 02:10:28,360
I mean I guess if you're
talking about you're right.

5223
02:10:28,390 --> 02:10:28,840
It's like,

5224
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:29,261
sure,

5225
02:10:29,261 --> 02:10:30,041
I guess it's their right,

5226
02:10:30,041 --> 02:10:31,420
but I disagree with them doing it.

5227
02:10:31,450 --> 02:10:31,900
I would,

5228
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:33,380
I would like a world where you were like,

5229
02:10:33,381 --> 02:10:34,214
we don't,

5230
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:37,100
unless it's physical harm to someone,

5231
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:38,330
possibly monetary,

5232
02:10:38,331 --> 02:10:39,740
like direct monetary harm,

5233
02:10:39,741 --> 02:10:40,760
like I'm stealing from you.

5234
02:10:41,170 --> 02:10:44,240
It infringes on your rights
then do what you want.

5235
02:10:44,270 --> 02:10:45,200
Say what you want.

5236
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:45,860
Right.

5237
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:48,170
It doesn't infringe on
your rights and keep going.

5238
02:10:48,230 --> 02:10:48,351
Well,

5239
02:10:48,351 --> 02:10:52,040
the problem he comes who's to
decide what is hate speech.

5240
02:10:52,070 --> 02:10:52,630
Exactly.

5241
02:10:52,630 --> 02:10:56,060
Who we don't decide that
and who is to decide.

5242
02:10:56,090 --> 02:10:59,750
Is it saying retard in a Thompson
Gora special hate speech?

5243
02:11:00,730 --> 02:11:01,230
It's,

5244
02:11:01,230 --> 02:11:01,890
it's,

5245
02:11:01,890 --> 02:11:06,890
it's such a slippery slope that the
only way to do it is if you infringe on

5246
02:11:07,011 --> 02:11:07,640
someone's right,

5247
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:09,770
you've gone too far because you haven't,

5248
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:13,220
you have not yelling fire
in a crowded theater.

5249
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:13,810
Yeah.

5250
02:11:13,810 --> 02:11:14,150
It's,

5251
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:15,240
it's free speech until you,

5252
02:11:15,241 --> 02:11:16,580
like someone is going to get,

5253
02:11:16,610 --> 02:11:19,730
is getting hurt from this or it's
very possible that they will,

5254
02:11:19,731 --> 02:11:22,730
you can see why they would not just
like it might hurt their feelings.

5255
02:11:22,731 --> 02:11:23,780
Am I making it harder for them to,

5256
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:24,620
to,

5257
02:11:24,620 --> 02:11:26,450
to be a kid in this world?

5258
02:11:26,930 --> 02:11:27,763
It's like no.

5259
02:11:28,020 --> 02:11:28,530
Yeah,

5260
02:11:28,530 --> 02:11:28,741
no,

5261
02:11:28,741 --> 02:11:29,490
I agree.

5262
02:11:29,490 --> 02:11:30,990
But I also agree that if you,

5263
02:11:30,991 --> 02:11:35,991
or NBC or ABC or CBS and someone says
things that you feel violate your

5264
02:11:38,251 --> 02:11:39,660
company's policies,

5265
02:11:39,690 --> 02:11:40,140
right?

5266
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:44,940
So if someone promotes some outlandish
conspiracy theory about children that

5267
02:11:44,941 --> 02:11:47,220
gets shot in Parkland really never died.

5268
02:11:47,221 --> 02:11:50,530
And their parents are all
crisis actors paid by the CIA.

5269
02:11:50,531 --> 02:11:52,560
It's a psy op and you know,

5270
02:11:52,561 --> 02:11:54,410
this person is on CBS,

5271
02:11:54,870 --> 02:11:57,340
you can fire them right now.

5272
02:11:57,341 --> 02:11:58,174
Worries the question.

5273
02:11:58,200 --> 02:11:59,700
But let me finish here.

5274
02:11:59,940 --> 02:12:03,060
So is Twitter like CBS Ppas,

5275
02:12:03,061 --> 02:12:04,380
they're both private companies.

5276
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:09,560
And are the people who are on
broadcasting on periscope and on Youtube,

5277
02:12:11,130 --> 02:12:14,790
are they essentially someone who is,

5278
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:15,810
I mean you kind of,

5279
02:12:15,810 --> 02:12:20,810
are you working with or for Youtube
if you're broadcasting on Youtube?

5280
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:21,181
I mean,

5281
02:12:21,181 --> 02:12:22,014
how do you look at it?

5282
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:22,951
I don't think so.

5283
02:12:22,951 --> 02:12:23,820
I think it's a private thing.

5284
02:12:23,821 --> 02:12:24,240
And I think,

5285
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:27,870
I think if you're making a
video on how to make a bomb,

5286
02:12:28,430 --> 02:12:28,890
um,

5287
02:12:28,890 --> 02:12:30,450
I think the authority should get in there,

5288
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:30,780
right?

5289
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:31,740
So you can't do that.

5290
02:12:31,810 --> 02:12:36,440
But what if you making a video about how
there's some people out there that are

5291
02:12:36,441 --> 02:12:38,380
lying about their children being shot?

5292
02:12:38,410 --> 02:12:39,090
Same thing.

5293
02:12:39,090 --> 02:12:39,811
Got The authorities.

5294
02:12:39,811 --> 02:12:41,100
Then if you think it's leading to harm,

5295
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:42,630
but it's not the company,

5296
02:12:42,631 --> 02:12:43,300
so you don't do it,

5297
02:12:43,300 --> 02:12:44,320
you should be allowed.

5298
02:12:44,321 --> 02:12:45,280
If your youtube,

5299
02:12:45,310 --> 02:12:47,020
you don't think you should
be allowed to tell someone,

5300
02:12:47,021 --> 02:12:47,381
hey,

5301
02:12:47,381 --> 02:12:48,430
you say a bunch of shit,

5302
02:12:48,431 --> 02:12:50,560
that's not true and it hurts people.

5303
02:12:51,090 --> 02:12:51,670
What's your,

5304
02:12:51,670 --> 02:12:52,091
what's the word?

5305
02:12:52,091 --> 02:12:52,750
Hurt me.

5306
02:12:52,750 --> 02:12:53,110
Well.

5307
02:12:53,110 --> 02:12:53,530
Okay,

5308
02:12:53,530 --> 02:12:58,530
if your children were murdered and
there's some guy screaming on youtube that

5309
02:12:58,781 --> 02:13:02,110
you're a crisis actor and nothing ever
happened to your kid and your kids,

5310
02:13:02,350 --> 02:13:03,280
it's a lie.

5311
02:13:03,460 --> 02:13:07,090
And there's rubber kids in the ground
with fake blood and they can prove it with

5312
02:13:07,091 --> 02:13:08,230
the Hologram.

5313
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:11,300
You shouldn't be able to
remove them from your,

5314
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:12,160
to your platform.

5315
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:12,731
Do you remember,

5316
02:13:12,731 --> 02:13:13,840
um,

5317
02:13:14,590 --> 02:13:15,730
what's his name from?

5318
02:13:16,540 --> 02:13:16,991
And by the way,

5319
02:13:16,991 --> 02:13:17,910
I'm not arguing by now.

5320
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:20,530
And the other is important for
people online to understand.

5321
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:22,540
This is the Kansas Pastor,

5322
02:13:22,600 --> 02:13:23,081
what's his name?

5323
02:13:23,081 --> 02:13:24,820
He died Kansas Pastor,

5324
02:13:24,910 --> 02:13:28,150
which we talked on the radio
once that not just church,

5325
02:13:28,151 --> 02:13:29,200
something Baptist Church.

5326
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:32,160
And he would go to funerals of,

5327
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:32,790
of uh,

5328
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:33,001
oh,

5329
02:13:33,001 --> 02:13:33,530
Phelps.

5330
02:13:33,530 --> 02:13:33,680
Yeah,

5331
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:34,070
yeah,

5332
02:13:34,070 --> 02:13:34,520
yeah,

5333
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:34,830
yeah.

5334
02:13:34,830 --> 02:13:35,880
And he would go there and say,

5335
02:13:35,881 --> 02:13:38,270
the reason your son died
is because gays around.

5336
02:13:38,290 --> 02:13:38,820
Yeah.

5337
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:40,430
And he ruined people's funerals.

5338
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:41,890
So much have a child who died.

5339
02:13:41,910 --> 02:13:43,770
My wife bags.com and not,

5340
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:46,140
and these weren't gay
soldiers were just soldiers.

5341
02:13:46,170 --> 02:13:46,980
Right?

5342
02:13:46,980 --> 02:13:47,813
It's horrible.

5343
02:13:48,150 --> 02:13:52,080
And then other people had to do things
like create a blockade around their cars

5344
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:52,840
and say,

5345
02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:53,640
give us tickets.

5346
02:13:53,640 --> 02:13:54,480
We'll eventually move,

5347
02:13:54,481 --> 02:13:55,470
but the funeral will be over.

5348
02:13:56,610 --> 02:13:56,821
Yeah,

5349
02:13:56,821 --> 02:13:57,210
man,

5350
02:13:57,210 --> 02:13:58,230
that's sucky behavior.

5351
02:13:58,260 --> 02:13:59,460
You can't stop them from doing it.

5352
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:00,540
Okay.

5353
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:00,920
You so,

5354
02:14:00,920 --> 02:14:01,200
okay,

5355
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:03,450
so go to CME terms of public discourse.

5356
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:05,420
So go to CBS and say that and say like,

5357
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:05,880
well,

5358
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:08,520
we can take you down because you've
said things that are totally untrue.

5359
02:14:08,970 --> 02:14:12,090
What about the guy who gets
caught smoking weed in,

5360
02:14:12,340 --> 02:14:12,900
uh,

5361
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:15,030
I was a legal state and I'm in Alabama.

5362
02:14:15,690 --> 02:14:16,590
Could you fire from that?

5363
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:17,401
Yeah,

5364
02:14:17,401 --> 02:14:18,390
but that's a different thing.

5365
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:20,160
It goes against what we think is okay.

5366
02:14:20,970 --> 02:14:21,900
That's a slippery slope.

5367
02:14:21,930 --> 02:14:22,141
I mean,

5368
02:14:22,141 --> 02:14:22,620
if you're saying,

5369
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:24,030
are you allowed legally?

5370
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:24,271
Yes,

5371
02:14:24,271 --> 02:14:25,104
of course.

5372
02:14:25,650 --> 02:14:26,371
But morally,

5373
02:14:26,371 --> 02:14:26,850
no.

5374
02:14:26,850 --> 02:14:27,420
I think you,

5375
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:29,430
you're a fucking platform for speech.

5376
02:14:29,460 --> 02:14:30,840
So let all the speech in.

5377
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:31,590
Mm.

5378
02:14:31,590 --> 02:14:34,800
And four Chan got written up
as this fucking hateful place.

5379
02:14:34,801 --> 02:14:35,191
We're really,

5380
02:14:35,191 --> 02:14:36,270
they're just trolls.

5381
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:39,570
And they know one of the best ways
to troll is using Donald Trump.

5382
02:14:39,630 --> 02:14:39,751
Well,

5383
02:14:39,751 --> 02:14:39,910
you know,

5384
02:14:39,910 --> 02:14:43,260
there was a really interesting case
with four Chan that I found preposterous

5385
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:45,680
where they trolled Sheil booth.

5386
02:14:45,790 --> 02:14:46,623
Oh yeah.

5387
02:14:46,820 --> 02:14:47,510
They took down that,

5388
02:14:47,510 --> 02:14:48,331
that podcast.

5389
02:14:48,331 --> 02:14:48,721
Yes.

5390
02:14:48,721 --> 02:14:50,570
We tell us it was great.

5391
02:14:50,860 --> 02:14:51,390
It was great.

5392
02:14:51,390 --> 02:14:52,051
It was hilarious.

5393
02:14:52,051 --> 02:14:52,411
And people go,

5394
02:14:52,411 --> 02:14:54,070
how dare you promote four Chan,

5395
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:54,961
they're a hate group.

5396
02:14:54,961 --> 02:14:55,450
And you're like,

5397
02:14:55,450 --> 02:14:56,520
you didn't listen.

5398
02:14:56,970 --> 02:14:59,040
We've just said that
they're not a hate group.

5399
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:00,091
And you're like,

5400
02:15:00,091 --> 02:15:00,631
fuck you,

5401
02:15:00,631 --> 02:15:01,860
I don't like that interpretation.

5402
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:02,431
Fuck you.

5403
02:15:02,431 --> 02:15:03,264
Norm Macdonald's.

5404
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:04,290
I liked the interpretation.

5405
02:15:04,291 --> 02:15:05,610
She did know that lady was black.

5406
02:15:06,870 --> 02:15:07,111
Okay.

5407
02:15:07,111 --> 02:15:08,100
You went real far with that.

5408
02:15:08,110 --> 02:15:11,040
But you can't say Rosanne wasn't racist.

5409
02:15:11,070 --> 02:15:11,160
I,

5410
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:11,550
he's like,

5411
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:13,470
he's not saying racism is okay.

5412
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:14,190
He goes,

5413
02:15:14,190 --> 02:15:15,080
we're Norma sang.

5414
02:15:15,180 --> 02:15:16,620
I don't think she was new.

5415
02:15:16,621 --> 02:15:17,610
That lady was black.

5416
02:15:17,730 --> 02:15:18,391
I agree with four.

5417
02:15:18,391 --> 02:15:20,430
Chan is not saying pro Trump.

5418
02:15:20,431 --> 02:15:24,480
Fuck all of you pro Trump at fortune
is saying this will fuck with you.

5419
02:15:24,570 --> 02:15:25,403
Let's fuck with you.

5420
02:15:25,450 --> 02:15:27,570
Well they're saying fuck
Shiela booth cause he's,

5421
02:15:27,571 --> 02:15:32,571
he's a goof and they decided to
use science and they literally,

5422
02:15:33,150 --> 02:15:33,810
they,

5423
02:15:33,810 --> 02:15:36,540
they studied the stars in the sky.

5424
02:15:36,570 --> 02:15:37,560
Oh it was amazing.

5425
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:41,970
Amazing troll had someone drive around
and beeped their horn so they could

5426
02:15:41,971 --> 02:15:44,960
triangulate the area where this has taken
me where the airplanes were going over

5427
02:15:44,961 --> 02:15:45,510
ahead.

5428
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:46,170
Took the FA.

5429
02:15:46,170 --> 02:15:47,003
Yeah.

5430
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:48,490
Took the fucking flag down and went,

5431
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:50,310
Fuck Shiloh of the day.

5432
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:55,430
They found it somewhere in the world and
the podcast was great and there was no

5433
02:15:55,681 --> 02:15:56,401
hate involve.

5434
02:15:56,401 --> 02:15:58,610
It had nothing to do
with political ideology,

5435
02:15:58,620 --> 02:16:00,570
had nothing to do with racism
and nothing to do with hate.

5436
02:16:00,810 --> 02:16:01,410
And people were saying,

5437
02:16:01,410 --> 02:16:01,531
Oh,

5438
02:16:01,531 --> 02:16:03,330
you're supporting you dope was fortunate.

5439
02:16:03,331 --> 02:16:04,050
Supports Hitler.

5440
02:16:04,050 --> 02:16:04,590
Now listen,

5441
02:16:04,590 --> 02:16:06,480
four Chan is just a bunch
of people and it's like,

5442
02:16:06,481 --> 02:16:06,601
yeah,

5443
02:16:06,601 --> 02:16:09,480
they've just said in that podcast a
fortunate does not support littler.

5444
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:09,810
Yeah,

5445
02:16:09,810 --> 02:16:10,830
they go Trump,

5446
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:10,831
Trumbull,

5447
02:16:10,831 --> 02:16:11,520
fuck with people.

5448
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:14,310
Let's align that with some
fucking weird fraud for no reason.

5449
02:16:14,311 --> 02:16:15,010
It makes no sense.

5450
02:16:15,010 --> 02:16:15,630
Right.

5451
02:16:15,630 --> 02:16:18,990
And that's now explained to me where
that frog thing came from and I'm like,

5452
02:16:18,991 --> 02:16:19,231
Oh,

5453
02:16:19,231 --> 02:16:20,550
you're just pulled a random thing out.

5454
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:22,410
Well most of that frog thing was fun.

5455
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:23,273
It was fun.

5456
02:16:23,310 --> 02:16:23,670
Yeah.

5457
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:26,190
And there was a few
instances of that frog,

5458
02:16:26,191 --> 02:16:29,770
which were racist or KKK
versions or Nazi versions.

5459
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:32,470
And then people decided
that whole frog racist.

5460
02:16:32,471 --> 02:16:35,410
But he's all over in
Geneva as a good luck sign.

5461
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:36,400
Different different case.

5462
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:40,170
The vast majority of the use
of that frog was not racist.

5463
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:41,500
The vast majority was,

5464
02:16:41,501 --> 02:16:42,161
feels bad,

5465
02:16:42,161 --> 02:16:42,660
man.

5466
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:42,850
Yeah.

5467
02:16:42,850 --> 02:16:44,140
It was silly trolling.

5468
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:45,340
It was just being silly.

5469
02:16:45,341 --> 02:16:45,700
Yeah.

5470
02:16:45,700 --> 02:16:46,031
Yeah.

5471
02:16:46,031 --> 02:16:47,230
And then there was like,

5472
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:50,440
you can't let people coopt a frog,

5473
02:16:50,990 --> 02:16:51,500
you know,

5474
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:52,360
NPR,

5475
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:54,760
I think it was NPR podcasts.

5476
02:16:54,761 --> 02:16:55,570
It might've been,

5477
02:16:55,570 --> 02:16:56,890
I'm not sure what the company was.

5478
02:16:57,140 --> 02:16:57,581
They were like,

5479
02:16:57,581 --> 02:16:57,671
yeah,

5480
02:16:57,671 --> 02:16:58,270
we'll take it down.

5481
02:16:58,270 --> 02:16:58,871
You can still have it.

5482
02:16:58,871 --> 02:17:00,520
It's still on Radiolab.

5483
02:17:00,580 --> 02:17:01,030
Radiolab.

5484
02:17:01,030 --> 02:17:01,290
Okay.

5485
02:17:01,290 --> 02:17:01,720
Yeah.

5486
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:02,141
And they're like,

5487
02:17:02,141 --> 02:17:02,771
sorry about that.

5488
02:17:02,771 --> 02:17:04,360
We'll take it out on youtube.

5489
02:17:04,930 --> 02:17:05,763
I just heard it.

5490
02:17:05,770 --> 02:17:05,981
Well,

5491
02:17:05,981 --> 02:17:06,761
I have two was taking,

5492
02:17:06,761 --> 02:17:07,511
downloaded it.

5493
02:17:07,511 --> 02:17:08,980
And then when I went to send people to it,

5494
02:17:08,981 --> 02:17:13,420
I found out on the show on the podcast
that it had been taken down and I was

5495
02:17:13,421 --> 02:17:13,511
like,

5496
02:17:13,511 --> 02:17:15,250
you gotta be fucking version is down,

5497
02:17:15,251 --> 02:17:16,540
but you can still get it other places.

5498
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:18,610
But for them to apologize is meet saying,

5499
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:18,881
okay,

5500
02:17:18,881 --> 02:17:19,540
you're weak.

5501
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:20,710
You're allowed to take that down.

5502
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:21,160
Right.

5503
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:23,200
But for someone else to come in and say,

5504
02:17:23,201 --> 02:17:25,540
you can't make podcasts anymore,

5505
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:26,210
right.

5506
02:17:26,210 --> 02:17:27,880
Is like really dangerous.

5507
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:30,370
And that could have happened from that.

5508
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:31,390
If someone had said,

5509
02:17:31,391 --> 02:17:31,601
no,

5510
02:17:31,601 --> 02:17:32,890
we're not going to take it down.

5511
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,890
So radio lab is now hate monger.

5512
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:36,130
Exactly.

5513
02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:36,700
Their support.

5514
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:40,330
They support four Chan for Chan's
about Hitler radio lab supports Hitler.

5515
02:17:40,420 --> 02:17:40,810
Yeah,

5516
02:17:40,810 --> 02:17:41,321
I mean this is,

5517
02:17:41,321 --> 02:17:42,640
this is a circular logic.

5518
02:17:42,790 --> 02:17:42,991
Yeah.

5519
02:17:42,991 --> 02:17:47,050
So the only answer is you have to have
a strong line and it's causing direct

5520
02:17:47,051 --> 02:17:50,560
physical damage to someone
that's everything's allowed.

5521
02:17:50,561 --> 02:17:50,950
Well,

5522
02:17:50,950 --> 02:17:51,610
W Dave,

5523
02:17:51,610 --> 02:17:52,300
they were,

5524
02:17:52,300 --> 02:17:53,740
the Internet is a horrible place.

5525
02:17:54,190 --> 02:17:55,510
It's a great place to though.

5526
02:17:55,630 --> 02:17:57,610
They should have never
fucking taken that down.

5527
02:17:57,640 --> 02:17:57,910
Nope.

5528
02:17:57,910 --> 02:17:58,970
They should have been like that podcast.

5529
02:17:59,050 --> 02:18:02,880
You listen to it and it
made me laugh so hard.

5530
02:18:02,890 --> 02:18:06,390
They told him how they got together
in a trolling Isaac [inaudible],

5531
02:18:06,430 --> 02:18:08,460
science logic.

5532
02:18:08,470 --> 02:18:08,831
These things.

5533
02:18:08,831 --> 02:18:11,320
These are smart fucking people that
figured out where that flag was

5534
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:13,653
hilarious.

5535
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:15,130
It was such a good podcast.

5536
02:18:15,131 --> 02:18:15,851
But being wild,

5537
02:18:15,851 --> 02:18:16,600
by the way,

5538
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:18,010
meet talking about it on,

5539
02:18:18,070 --> 02:18:18,940
on people.

5540
02:18:18,950 --> 02:18:19,150
Like,

5541
02:18:19,150 --> 02:18:20,590
I can't believe you don't get it.

5542
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:21,371
You know you,

5543
02:18:21,371 --> 02:18:22,091
you're fucking,

5544
02:18:22,091 --> 02:18:24,370
you always have all these
white supremacists on.

5545
02:18:24,430 --> 02:18:25,480
Are you all right?

5546
02:18:25,510 --> 02:18:26,081
Are you this?

5547
02:18:26,081 --> 02:18:26,670
I mean,

5548
02:18:26,670 --> 02:18:30,820
every day people will tweet at me with
stupid shit like that and that one

5549
02:18:30,821 --> 02:18:34,870
podcast me saying how great that podcast
was in particular people saying what

5550
02:18:34,871 --> 02:18:36,280
the fuck is wrong with Joe Rogan?

5551
02:18:36,281 --> 02:18:36,461
You know,

5552
02:18:36,461 --> 02:18:37,690
I used to think he was a good guy.

5553
02:18:37,810 --> 02:18:40,510
Now I think he's a white supremacist
or he's a fucking racist.

5554
02:18:40,511 --> 02:18:41,640
He's a KKK person.

5555
02:18:41,650 --> 02:18:42,090
Yeah,

5556
02:18:42,090 --> 02:18:42,671
I guess so.

5557
02:18:42,671 --> 02:18:43,331
Stupid.

5558
02:18:43,331 --> 02:18:44,260
One of my favorite books,

5559
02:18:44,261 --> 02:18:44,951
maybe my favorite,

5560
02:18:44,951 --> 02:18:46,020
I don't like to use that word favorite,

5561
02:18:46,021 --> 02:18:51,021
but like the fountainhead by
Ayn rand and people go like,

5562
02:18:51,270 --> 02:18:52,780
oh social isyou know,

5563
02:18:52,810 --> 02:18:53,111
you know,

5564
02:18:53,111 --> 02:18:54,930
she took fucking social
security in her old age.

5565
02:18:54,930 --> 02:18:55,763
She never did.

5566
02:18:55,870 --> 02:18:56,261
And I'm like,

5567
02:18:56,261 --> 02:18:56,651
okay,

5568
02:18:56,651 --> 02:18:57,140
okay.

5569
02:18:57,140 --> 02:18:59,590
And I used to shit on it and
I'm right all the time myself.

5570
02:18:59,770 --> 02:19:01,840
And then I realize I've
actually never read a book,

5571
02:19:02,140 --> 02:19:05,830
read the fountainhead and it changed my
life like not even a little bit to the

5572
02:19:05,831 --> 02:19:06,970
direction of my career.

5573
02:19:07,030 --> 02:19:09,340
I still correct it freed me as an artist.

5574
02:19:09,460 --> 02:19:09,540
Oh,

5575
02:19:09,540 --> 02:19:11,950
so you've got to read it Bro.

5576
02:19:11,951 --> 02:19:12,360
But it's,

5577
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:12,640
it's,

5578
02:19:12,640 --> 02:19:14,830
it's all about how to read a chapter of,

5579
02:19:14,831 --> 02:19:18,130
it took me a year and a
half to read every chapter.

5580
02:19:18,131 --> 02:19:18,670
I'd sit down,

5581
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:19,690
I think about it for two weeks.

5582
02:19:19,691 --> 02:19:22,540
What I read that the Jordan
Peterson talks about her as a,

5583
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:23,411
as a philosopher.

5584
02:19:23,411 --> 02:19:25,360
He doesn't like her as a novelist.

5585
02:19:25,361 --> 02:19:25,901
She's like,

5586
02:19:25,901 --> 02:19:26,400
she's great.

5587
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:26,690
What,

5588
02:19:26,690 --> 02:19:27,160
what,

5589
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:27,831
what was it about it?

5590
02:19:27,831 --> 02:19:27,971
Hey,

5591
02:19:27,971 --> 02:19:28,070
it

5592
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:30,040
shows you a true artist
and it shows you a,

5593
02:19:30,041 --> 02:19:32,570
a jobber and the jobber.

5594
02:19:32,630 --> 02:19:33,140
Yeah,

5595
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:34,220
like pro wrestling style,

5596
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:38,330
sort of someone who's just like doing
it for the money as opposed to what a

5597
02:19:38,331 --> 02:19:38,990
pure,

5598
02:19:38,990 --> 02:19:39,823
like Abby,

5599
02:19:39,830 --> 02:19:40,663
Abby Martin,

5600
02:19:40,780 --> 02:19:41,361
he Harris,

5601
02:19:41,361 --> 02:19:41,900
what's her name?

5602
02:19:41,900 --> 02:19:42,410
Which one?

5603
02:19:42,410 --> 02:19:43,150
The journalists.

5604
02:19:43,150 --> 02:19:44,120
Abby Martin Martin,

5605
02:19:44,121 --> 02:19:44,261
who was,

5606
02:19:44,261 --> 02:19:44,570
she's like,

5607
02:19:44,570 --> 02:19:44,721
oh,

5608
02:19:44,721 --> 02:19:46,910
I don't want to just
take money for reporting.

5609
02:19:46,911 --> 02:19:48,290
I want to actually real report now.

5610
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:48,860
Yes.

5611
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:50,540
So she's a ton of a true artist,

5612
02:19:50,541 --> 02:19:51,374
at least in that moment.

5613
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:55,460
And none of us can be a fully true artist
and none of us are really just full

5614
02:19:55,470 --> 02:19:55,971
jobbers.

5615
02:19:55,971 --> 02:19:57,890
We will have a little
bit of artistic taste.

5616
02:19:57,891 --> 02:19:59,810
Even the jobbers have the
fucking little bit of like,

5617
02:19:59,811 --> 02:20:00,680
I wanna do some interesting,

5618
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:01,560
you know,

5619
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:02,420
and the full artists,

5620
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:03,373
it's just,

5621
02:20:03,460 --> 02:20:04,490
it's an almost an impossible,

5622
02:20:04,491 --> 02:20:05,540
a hundred percent ideal.

5623
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:08,120
But if you can only aim for that,

5624
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:10,220
if a sponsor says,

5625
02:20:10,221 --> 02:20:13,100
we need you to fucking tone
it down to realize like,

5626
02:20:13,550 --> 02:20:14,390
oh fuck,

5627
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:15,830
I just came up another four grand.

5628
02:20:16,220 --> 02:20:16,700
No,

5629
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:17,181
sorry,

5630
02:20:17,181 --> 02:20:18,200
I can't use you anymore,

5631
02:20:18,270 --> 02:20:18,830
goddammit.

5632
02:20:18,830 --> 02:20:19,360
I hate this.

5633
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:21,590
That's what fuck you money
is all about sort of.

5634
02:20:21,591 --> 02:20:21,980
Yeah,

5635
02:20:21,980 --> 02:20:24,010
but this guy didn't have
fuck you money in the,

5636
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:24,621
this guy's like,

5637
02:20:24,621 --> 02:20:25,170
I'll go back up.

5638
02:20:25,170 --> 02:20:25,760
Mike's,

5639
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:26,840
I'll go back to open mikes.

5640
02:20:27,410 --> 02:20:31,340
You can't take away my ability
to freely do this no matter what.

5641
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:34,940
So it freed me in terms of like
being able to think that way,

5642
02:20:35,190 --> 02:20:35,931
who's really,

5643
02:20:35,931 --> 02:20:37,130
really informative to me.

5644
02:20:37,490 --> 02:20:38,930
But if I had just heard
these people going,

5645
02:20:38,931 --> 02:20:39,381
fuck her,

5646
02:20:39,381 --> 02:20:40,340
she's a socialist.

5647
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:41,473
And then you read it like,

5648
02:20:41,540 --> 02:20:41,721
Oh,

5649
02:20:41,721 --> 02:20:42,800
I'm not getting what you're saying.

5650
02:20:42,801 --> 02:20:43,260
I did this,

5651
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:43,541
I,

5652
02:20:43,541 --> 02:20:45,080
I'm missing this amazing stuff.

5653
02:20:45,740 --> 02:20:46,700
So the people who will just say,

5654
02:20:46,701 --> 02:20:47,421
Oh fuck you,

5655
02:20:47,421 --> 02:20:48,620
four Chan is hatemongers.

5656
02:20:48,621 --> 02:20:49,760
It's like you didn't really even,

5657
02:20:49,790 --> 02:20:51,380
you're not even listening to
what they're actually doing.

5658
02:20:51,730 --> 02:20:53,740
As soon as you eliminate
nuance and you eat,

5659
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:55,960
you have reductionist ideology,

5660
02:20:55,990 --> 02:20:56,350
right?

5661
02:20:56,350 --> 02:20:57,550
You just want to reduce something to,

5662
02:20:57,551 --> 02:20:57,710
oh,

5663
02:20:57,710 --> 02:20:58,480
he's racist.

5664
02:20:58,480 --> 02:20:58,631
Oh,

5665
02:20:58,631 --> 02:20:59,350
he's hateful.

5666
02:20:59,350 --> 02:20:59,471
Oh,

5667
02:20:59,471 --> 02:20:59,861
he's this.

5668
02:20:59,861 --> 02:21:00,550
He's that,

5669
02:21:00,550 --> 02:21:01,000
that,

5670
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:01,780
that is the,

5671
02:21:01,780 --> 02:21:03,190
that's where ideas go to die.

5672
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:03,950
Does you,

5673
02:21:03,950 --> 02:21:04,610
you,

5674
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:07,870
you eliminate what is
what it is to be a human,

5675
02:21:07,871 --> 02:21:10,510
what needs to be a human is
to be constantly conflicted,

5676
02:21:10,870 --> 02:21:13,150
to deal with a bunch of
different contrary ideas,

5677
02:21:13,151 --> 02:21:15,280
bouncing around your head
left and right all the time.

5678
02:21:15,910 --> 02:21:16,300
You know,

5679
02:21:16,300 --> 02:21:18,310
and if you,

5680
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:22,690
if you want to eliminate the ability
to talk to people that you don't agree

5681
02:21:22,691 --> 02:21:23,524
with,

5682
02:21:23,590 --> 02:21:24,040
boy,

5683
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:27,550
you're living in a fucking bizarre bubble
because you're not going to agree with

5684
02:21:27,551 --> 02:21:28,690
yourself five years from now.

5685
02:21:28,691 --> 02:21:29,410
Most likely.

5686
02:21:29,410 --> 02:21:29,650
Yeah.

5687
02:21:29,650 --> 02:21:29,951
I mean,

5688
02:21:29,951 --> 02:21:31,420
if I had an argument today,

5689
02:21:32,110 --> 02:21:33,190
15 years ago,

5690
02:21:33,370 --> 02:21:34,203
I'd be like,

5691
02:21:34,300 --> 02:21:34,571
man,

5692
02:21:34,571 --> 02:21:35,620
you're a fucking dumb ass.

5693
02:21:36,010 --> 02:21:37,390
You need to stop thinking this way.

5694
02:21:37,391 --> 02:21:38,470
You need to stop doing this.

5695
02:21:38,620 --> 02:21:40,420
He need to look at
yourself more objectively.

5696
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:42,640
Tell you why.

5697
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:43,141
Think that.

5698
02:21:43,141 --> 02:21:43,581
And just like,

5699
02:21:43,581 --> 02:21:43,741
listen,

5700
02:21:43,741 --> 02:21:43,870
if,

5701
02:21:43,870 --> 02:21:46,680
I mean the fact that we're so divisive,

5702
02:21:46,681 --> 02:21:48,390
but like no one listens.

5703
02:21:48,391 --> 02:21:49,210
The other side I'll,

5704
02:21:49,210 --> 02:21:51,540
I'll give the easiest
argument to me is abortion.

5705
02:21:52,050 --> 02:21:52,883
Where it's like,

5706
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:53,161
well,

5707
02:21:53,161 --> 02:21:54,760
both sides of pro life,

5708
02:21:55,350 --> 02:21:58,830
the idea of life and both
sides are also pro choice.

5709
02:21:58,831 --> 02:22:00,030
No one's against choice,

5710
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:01,950
but you're not hearing the other side.

5711
02:22:02,190 --> 02:22:03,570
So one side is saying,

5712
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:04,080
um,

5713
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:05,700
it's a woman's right to choose her body.

5714
02:22:05,730 --> 02:22:06,181
It's her choice.

5715
02:22:06,181 --> 02:22:06,480
And it's like,

5716
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:06,751
okay,

5717
02:22:06,751 --> 02:22:08,160
but yes,

5718
02:22:08,161 --> 02:22:08,641
it's her body,

5719
02:22:08,641 --> 02:22:09,750
but it ain't a tattoo.

5720
02:22:10,230 --> 02:22:10,471
There's,

5721
02:22:10,471 --> 02:22:10,831
you know,

5722
02:22:10,831 --> 02:22:12,690
there's more to it than just her body.

5723
02:22:13,020 --> 02:22:13,801
And then the other side,

5724
02:22:13,801 --> 02:22:14,340
it's like,

5725
02:22:14,340 --> 02:22:15,031
it's a human life.

5726
02:22:15,031 --> 02:22:15,270
Like,

5727
02:22:15,270 --> 02:22:15,661
okay,

5728
02:22:15,661 --> 02:22:15,931
yes,

5729
02:22:15,931 --> 02:22:16,411
it's a life,

5730
02:22:16,411 --> 02:22:19,140
but also this chick has to
carry it for nine months.

5731
02:22:19,410 --> 02:22:21,360
She's gotta change her whole
body in order to carry.

5732
02:22:21,361 --> 02:22:22,410
It's not just simply,

5733
02:22:22,590 --> 02:22:23,220
it's a life.

5734
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:24,750
It's not like they're going
in and murdering babies.

5735
02:22:24,990 --> 02:22:25,823
It's in a cuma.

5736
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:26,070
So

5737
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:27,150
can you guys actually talk,

5738
02:22:27,660 --> 02:22:29,640
can you guys really
talk and own up to like,

5739
02:22:29,820 --> 02:22:31,830
it's no more than just one side ground.

5740
02:22:31,950 --> 02:22:32,420
Yeah.

5741
02:22:32,420 --> 02:22:33,253
Right.

5742
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:36,120
The people with the pro
choice or saying no,

5743
02:22:36,121 --> 02:22:38,670
it's a woman's right to choose
and the people that are pro life,

5744
02:22:38,671 --> 02:22:41,790
so you know you're killing a baby
and if you give up any ground,

5745
02:22:41,791 --> 02:22:42,780
the baby's going to die.

5746
02:22:42,970 --> 02:22:45,930
Or I'm going to take away a woman's
right to have an abortion and then she's

5747
02:22:45,931 --> 02:22:47,940
going to have to carry a bunch of
kids from people that raped her.

5748
02:22:48,420 --> 02:22:48,751
And there's,

5749
02:22:48,751 --> 02:22:51,420
this is the worst case scenario
and extremes on both ends.

5750
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:52,351
As a booker,

5751
02:22:52,351 --> 02:22:53,310
as a former booker,

5752
02:22:53,820 --> 02:22:55,050
someone who books a show,

5753
02:22:55,051 --> 02:22:55,321
they're like,

5754
02:22:55,321 --> 02:22:55,921
you need more women.

5755
02:22:55,921 --> 02:22:56,160
It's like,

5756
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:56,311
oh,

5757
02:22:56,311 --> 02:22:57,270
I'm looking at hard,

5758
02:22:57,810 --> 02:23:00,420
but you have to understand that I'm
not going to hurt my product over.

5759
02:23:00,421 --> 02:23:01,230
I do want diversity.

5760
02:23:01,230 --> 02:23:02,490
I want diversity of opinion on there.

5761
02:23:02,491 --> 02:23:03,690
I want diversity of experience.

5762
02:23:03,810 --> 02:23:05,010
I want some Australians,

5763
02:23:05,011 --> 02:23:06,840
I want some fucking black people.

5764
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:10,740
Ali Said deek cause a far different
life experience than I do.

5765
02:23:10,940 --> 02:23:11,180
Right.

5766
02:23:11,180 --> 02:23:11,370
You know,

5767
02:23:11,370 --> 02:23:12,300
forget about my race.

5768
02:23:12,301 --> 02:23:14,220
Just his life experience is way different.

5769
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:14,851
You know,

5770
02:23:14,851 --> 02:23:16,320
all I see Deacon Byron Bowers,

5771
02:23:16,321 --> 02:23:18,420
both black guys gives a
far different worldview.

5772
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:19,403
Yeah.

5773
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:21,480
So I do want that diversity of experience,

5774
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:22,720
but I'm not going to hurt my PR.

5775
02:23:22,730 --> 02:23:24,780
I'm not gonna get some shitty
guy who just was in prison,

5776
02:23:24,781 --> 02:23:25,800
doesn't have to tell the story.

5777
02:23:25,830 --> 02:23:26,220
Right?

5778
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:27,330
So I'll work hard,

5779
02:23:27,630 --> 02:23:29,040
but meet me halfway.

5780
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:30,121
I will do it,

5781
02:23:30,121 --> 02:23:31,500
but find me quality people.

5782
02:23:31,790 --> 02:23:34,590
So I'll go to fucking
Atlanta and five ms pat.

5783
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:35,513
But I'll go,

5784
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:36,570
I have to go far for it.

5785
02:23:36,810 --> 02:23:39,750
So if somebody cancels on my show
and now I have five white guys,

5786
02:23:39,751 --> 02:23:40,830
don't be like fuck you.

5787
02:23:41,610 --> 02:23:43,800
Look into a little more like
I just had two chicks cancel,

5788
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:46,020
so meet me halfway.

5789
02:23:46,470 --> 02:23:51,210
Well whenever you're looking for diversity
as opposed to looking for the best

5790
02:23:51,211 --> 02:23:52,200
possible product,

5791
02:23:52,620 --> 02:23:53,453
you've got an issue.

5792
02:23:53,750 --> 02:23:56,340
And part of that best part
is some diversity of opinion.

5793
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:56,781
That is,

5794
02:23:56,781 --> 02:23:57,121
that is.

5795
02:23:57,121 --> 02:23:57,510
But,

5796
02:23:57,510 --> 02:23:58,590
but it should be good.

5797
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:01,110
And there's no reason why the
two are mutually exclusive.

5798
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:06,980
Like the idea that there's only a certain
limited amount of good ideas that come

5799
02:24:07,980 --> 02:24:09,780
mostly from white people is ridiculous.

5800
02:24:10,170 --> 02:24:10,411
Right?

5801
02:24:10,411 --> 02:24:13,890
So there's plenty of ideas that will
come from Asians and plenty of ideas that

5802
02:24:13,891 --> 02:24:17,370
come from all sorts of different
ethnicities that are also excellent.

5803
02:24:17,550 --> 02:24:19,320
So it's just finding them.

5804
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:24,450
But when you guarantee that you're going
to have five of this and five of that,

5805
02:24:24,451 --> 02:24:25,720
that's when you're going to
have a real fucking thing.

5806
02:24:25,721 --> 02:24:26,970
So I had my friends,

5807
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:28,230
my friend,

5808
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:29,273
um,

5809
02:24:29,490 --> 02:24:31,140
Colette said that we're doing in the,

5810
02:24:31,141 --> 02:24:31,531
in the,

5811
02:24:31,531 --> 02:24:31,830
uh,

5812
02:24:31,830 --> 02:24:34,380
in the business world is they're
taking what their industry is,

5813
02:24:34,381 --> 02:24:36,060
the number of let's say,

5814
02:24:36,061 --> 02:24:36,880
men and women only,

5815
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:38,460
I forget I'm black and white and Latino,

5816
02:24:38,461 --> 02:24:38,730
whatever.

5817
02:24:38,730 --> 02:24:39,330
Just men and women,

5818
02:24:39,330 --> 02:24:42,960
they're taking the number of people in
the industry and in order to correct,

5819
02:24:43,530 --> 02:24:43,951
uh,

5820
02:24:43,951 --> 02:24:45,610
an over use of males,

5821
02:24:45,611 --> 02:24:45,991
let's say,

5822
02:24:45,991 --> 02:24:49,290
or the other way over use of
females and like autistic training,

5823
02:24:49,320 --> 02:24:50,040
you know,

5824
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:51,570
but let's just say in the business world,

5825
02:24:51,870 --> 02:24:53,160
it's 70,

5826
02:24:53,161 --> 02:24:53,710
30,

5827
02:24:53,710 --> 02:24:54,543
making that up.

5828
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:54,970
Okay.

5829
02:24:54,970 --> 02:24:55,320
Um,

5830
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:59,460
so what you do is they force you instead
of his faith where California is like,

5831
02:24:59,461 --> 02:25:00,930
you must put a woman on your board.

5832
02:25:00,970 --> 02:25:01,230
Yes.

5833
02:25:01,230 --> 02:25:01,800
Which means like,

5834
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:02,041
okay,

5835
02:25:02,041 --> 02:25:02,460
if we just,

5836
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:03,570
we had three board members,

5837
02:25:03,571 --> 02:25:06,330
one left and we have to
hire a woman now wait,

5838
02:25:06,331 --> 02:25:07,770
Bill Gates just became available.

5839
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:08,910
He wants to work on our board,

5840
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:09,750
can't hire him,

5841
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:10,583
can't hire him.

5842
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:12,020
That's hurting my company.

5843
02:25:12,021 --> 02:25:13,070
You got to hire a cigarette time.

5844
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:13,830
He's great.

5845
02:25:13,830 --> 02:25:14,280
Yeah,

5846
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:16,080
so what they said is
in order to correct it,

5847
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:21,140
they will interview at a 10% higher
rate than the industry numbers so that

5848
02:25:21,171 --> 02:25:24,040
there'll be exposed slightly
to more of the people

5849
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:27,910
that are underrepresented and over time
that would correct the issue without

5850
02:25:27,911 --> 02:25:28,691
hurting any company.

5851
02:25:28,691 --> 02:25:29,710
I have to here,

5852
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:33,250
well let me hear why you think you're
right for the job and eventually you will

5853
02:25:33,251 --> 02:25:33,731
hear is people are like,

5854
02:25:33,731 --> 02:25:33,941
wow,

5855
02:25:33,941 --> 02:25:35,020
she was actually really good.

5856
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:36,730
Let's actually heart here or there,

5857
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:38,050
but if it's still bill gates,

5858
02:25:38,051 --> 02:25:39,190
you probably didn't get the job over him.

5859
02:25:39,430 --> 02:25:40,480
He's got his fucking,

5860
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:41,733
he's got his resume.

5861
02:25:41,890 --> 02:25:46,120
Well that's where Jordan Peterson comes
in with this equality of outcome id

5862
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:48,790
argument and the equality
of outcome argument is,

5863
02:25:48,830 --> 02:25:51,820
it's a dangerous argument if you
guarantee a quality of outcome.

5864
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:57,420
But I want to hear it that women are
going to make exactly the same amount as

5865
02:25:57,491 --> 02:25:58,210
men.

5866
02:25:58,210 --> 02:26:01,000
And so even if the man works harder,

5867
02:26:01,090 --> 02:26:02,830
the women is still gonna make
the same amount of money.

5868
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:03,850
Well that's ridiculous.

5869
02:26:03,910 --> 02:26:04,540
Yeah.

5870
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:05,373
Then vice versa cut up.

5871
02:26:06,070 --> 02:26:06,470
Sure.

5872
02:26:06,470 --> 02:26:07,390
But with the NFL,

5873
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:10,300
the NFL said you have to interview,

5874
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:12,370
I mean we're predominantly black.

5875
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:13,870
You have to interview,

5876
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:14,440
interview,

5877
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:15,160
not hire,

5878
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:18,220
interview one black candidate
before you hire somebody.

5879
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,520
So at least these people get
heard and sometimes you go like,

5880
02:26:21,550 --> 02:26:22,990
that guy was actually pretty fucking good.

5881
02:26:23,410 --> 02:26:24,340
Let's really consider them.

5882
02:26:24,370 --> 02:26:27,070
And then they get hired a little
more until it just shifts the needle.

5883
02:26:27,110 --> 02:26:27,240
Well,

5884
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:28,840
I only qualified people.

5885
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:31,690
Ideally what you would want is no racism,

5886
02:26:32,140 --> 02:26:32,891
no racism,

5887
02:26:32,891 --> 02:26:33,611
no sexism.

5888
02:26:33,611 --> 02:26:34,340
That's a deal.

5889
02:26:34,340 --> 02:26:38,140
And not to have to make some laws for it.

5890
02:26:38,260 --> 02:26:38,381
Yeah,

5891
02:26:38,381 --> 02:26:39,970
but we're not in that world where we live,

5892
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,230
but it would be nice.

5893
02:26:41,250 --> 02:26:41,530
Yeah,

5894
02:26:41,530 --> 02:26:45,940
that would be what we really would really
want is this is never an issue at all.

5895
02:26:45,941 --> 02:26:48,490
You're only getting people that
are great at it and that way we,

5896
02:26:48,491 --> 02:26:48,910
if,

5897
02:26:48,910 --> 02:26:49,270
if,

5898
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:50,920
if racism was not an issue at all,

5899
02:26:50,950 --> 02:26:52,330
if there was no racism whatsoever,

5900
02:26:52,690 --> 02:26:54,460
what you would say is,

5901
02:26:54,490 --> 02:26:55,300
oh look,

5902
02:26:55,300 --> 02:26:58,090
it seems like Asian people
gravitate towards this.

5903
02:26:58,210 --> 02:27:02,170
It seems like people have this color or
this culture rather gravitate towards

5904
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:04,660
this activity and I wonder why that is.

5905
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:05,890
And a set of saying,

5906
02:27:05,891 --> 02:27:07,600
why don't you hire more white people?

5907
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:07,991
You'd say,

5908
02:27:07,991 --> 02:27:11,260
it seems like white people aren't really
interested in that job at the cleaners.

5909
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:14,260
The cleaners in New York
is the variation job.

5910
02:27:14,350 --> 02:27:15,000
Yes.

5911
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:15,230
Well,

5912
02:27:15,230 --> 02:27:16,690
you're not like you need
to hire white people.

5913
02:27:16,750 --> 02:27:17,650
You need to hire black people.

5914
02:27:17,651 --> 02:27:21,110
It's like it's a job.

5915
02:27:21,190 --> 02:27:22,240
That's why nobody cares.

5916
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:23,081
Nobody cares.

5917
02:27:23,081 --> 02:27:25,930
But if it was a CEO of large
financial institutions,

5918
02:27:25,931 --> 02:27:26,261
you would say,

5919
02:27:26,261 --> 02:27:29,080
this is ridiculous that
it's all this and not that.

5920
02:27:29,260 --> 02:27:34,260
Ideally it would be a fascinating
social experiment or a,

5921
02:27:35,261 --> 02:27:39,400
a social observation to
find out what genders,

5922
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:41,350
what sexual orientation,

5923
02:27:41,380 --> 02:27:42,370
what race,

5924
02:27:42,371 --> 02:27:46,330
what g w what ethnicities
gravitate toward specific jobs.

5925
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:50,860
If those jobs didn't have
a hierarchy of desire,

5926
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:51,190
right.

5927
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:51,331
If,

5928
02:27:51,331 --> 02:27:54,310
if there wasn't some jobs
that are far more desirable.

5929
02:27:54,340 --> 02:27:54,760
Yeah.

5930
02:27:54,760 --> 02:27:55,380
I mean,

5931
02:27:55,380 --> 02:28:00,100
one of the arguments I had really early
on in Hollywood was with this guy who

5932
02:28:00,101 --> 02:28:00,911
was a really nice guy,

5933
02:28:00,911 --> 02:28:03,220
but he was Asian and he was saying,

5934
02:28:03,221 --> 02:28:05,200
there's no fucking rolls for Asian actors.

5935
02:28:05,201 --> 02:28:06,070
This is bullshit.

5936
02:28:06,250 --> 02:28:06,641
And I was like,

5937
02:28:06,641 --> 02:28:07,360
okay,

5938
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:08,500
why don't you make roles?

5939
02:28:08,501 --> 02:28:08,771
It's like,

5940
02:28:08,771 --> 02:28:09,431
it's not that easy.

5941
02:28:09,431 --> 02:28:09,671
I go,

5942
02:28:09,671 --> 02:28:10,210
I get it.

5943
02:28:10,210 --> 02:28:11,320
I understand that it's not that easy,

5944
02:28:11,321 --> 02:28:15,580
but do you think that someone should have
to write an Asian leading man because

5945
02:28:15,581 --> 02:28:17,350
you have a hard time getting a job,

5946
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:17,890
right?

5947
02:28:17,890 --> 02:28:19,300
Like what should they do?

5948
02:28:19,301 --> 02:28:21,830
Like how should it show ugly people?

5949
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:22,430
Right.

5950
02:28:22,430 --> 02:28:22,870
It's true.

5951
02:28:22,870 --> 02:28:23,703
Like what about,

5952
02:28:24,050 --> 02:28:25,730
what about people who are dwarves?

5953
02:28:26,010 --> 02:28:26,600
There's no,

5954
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:29,510
there's very few jobs for that
and the one guy's killing it.

5955
02:28:29,810 --> 02:28:32,210
That one guys dominated
that game of Thrones.

5956
02:28:32,211 --> 02:28:32,920
Dude,

5957
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:33,651
what'd you do?

5958
02:28:33,651 --> 02:28:34,201
Like what?

5959
02:28:34,201 --> 02:28:34,531
What?

5960
02:28:34,531 --> 02:28:37,040
What would you do to correct
that is the question.

5961
02:28:37,041 --> 02:28:38,810
It's not whether or not the world is fair.

5962
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:39,770
The world's not fair.

5963
02:28:39,890 --> 02:28:43,370
There's no five foot tall white
guys that are playing in the NBA.

5964
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:44,420
That's not fair either.

5965
02:28:44,470 --> 02:28:44,690
Yeah.

5966
02:28:44,690 --> 02:28:47,930
This weird shit that just
happens to be reality.

5967
02:28:48,140 --> 02:28:49,760
Like what do you do to correct that?

5968
02:28:49,910 --> 02:28:50,361
And you know,

5969
02:28:50,361 --> 02:28:53,580
he was really adamant that
Hollywood is racist and they're not,

5970
02:28:53,620 --> 02:28:56,420
not hiring Asians to be
leading men and Asians.

5971
02:28:56,500 --> 02:28:56,871
And I'm like,

5972
02:28:56,871 --> 02:28:57,704
okay,

5973
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:00,830
I see how it would be
frustrating for you as an actor.

5974
02:29:01,010 --> 02:29:01,730
But if you've,

5975
02:29:01,730 --> 02:29:06,470
if you're a screenwriter and you're a
guy who writes a story about a white guy

5976
02:29:06,471 --> 02:29:08,420
and moves into a haunted
house and you know,

5977
02:29:08,421 --> 02:29:11,450
he falls in love with this woman and
they buy a house together and the house

5978
02:29:11,451 --> 02:29:12,950
winds up being haunted and his monsters,

5979
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:14,510
you're saying,

5980
02:29:14,510 --> 02:29:14,991
should you,

5981
02:29:14,991 --> 02:29:18,800
should someone have to change that to
an Asian guy so that you get a job?

5982
02:29:18,890 --> 02:29:19,061
Yeah.

5983
02:29:19,061 --> 02:29:22,250
Well also simplistic because
it's like not hearing the other,

5984
02:29:22,310 --> 02:29:22,941
the other argument,

5985
02:29:22,941 --> 02:29:23,121
it's like,

5986
02:29:23,121 --> 02:29:23,540
okay,

5987
02:29:23,540 --> 02:29:26,120
sure that Becca could
be anybody that could,

5988
02:29:26,121 --> 02:29:26,690
it could be any,

5989
02:29:26,690 --> 02:29:27,260
any race,

5990
02:29:27,260 --> 02:29:27,710
right?

5991
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:28,850
But if me,

5992
02:29:28,851 --> 02:29:29,990
I'm not Hollywood,

5993
02:29:30,050 --> 02:29:32,330
I'm all guy making this one movie,

5994
02:29:32,360 --> 02:29:32,810
right?

5995
02:29:32,810 --> 02:29:34,610
And if I cast an Asian,

5996
02:29:35,690 --> 02:29:40,690
I'm probably going to make far less
money than if I cast a guy who looks like

5997
02:29:41,271 --> 02:29:42,950
most of the movie ticket purchasers,

5998
02:29:43,650 --> 02:29:46,280
which was a white guy or a famous person,

5999
02:29:46,281 --> 02:29:47,740
which you know is going
to sell it Brad Pitt.

6000
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:48,021
Sure,

6001
02:29:48,021 --> 02:29:48,680
absolutely.

6002
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:52,010
So then it's like you want me
to correct what Hollywood is,

6003
02:29:52,011 --> 02:29:53,060
but I'm not Hollywood.

6004
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:55,320
I'm just this producer for this movie

6005
02:29:55,410 --> 02:29:56,243
that becomes,

6006
02:29:56,270 --> 02:29:59,540
that's something that my friend
Frankie Renzulli said to me once,

6007
02:29:59,541 --> 02:29:59,811
he said,

6008
02:29:59,811 --> 02:30:00,710
there's no Hollywood.

6009
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:01,940
Right.

6010
02:30:01,940 --> 02:30:03,580
That's what I said about
the AIDS cure care.

6011
02:30:03,640 --> 02:30:03,980
Yeah.

6012
02:30:03,980 --> 02:30:04,970
Doctors have the cure,

6013
02:30:05,150 --> 02:30:06,180
but they make more,

6014
02:30:06,230 --> 02:30:09,410
they make more money in selling
the treatment off the treatment.

6015
02:30:09,411 --> 02:30:10,040
But I'm like,

6016
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:11,750
but there's no such thing as doctors.

6017
02:30:11,751 --> 02:30:13,070
There's doctors group.

6018
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:14,510
So if one doctor had it,

6019
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:17,540
he would be a billionaire if
he just released the cure.

6020
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:17,721
Well,

6021
02:30:17,721 --> 02:30:21,380
this is the main problem with conspiracy
theory is that everyone's working

6022
02:30:21,381 --> 02:30:22,214
together.

6023
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:26,150
Everyone's working together as a part of
some grand thing to keep the knowledge

6024
02:30:26,151 --> 02:30:28,670
that the world's flat away
from the general public,

6025
02:30:28,790 --> 02:30:29,960
like that kind of stupidity.

6026
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:34,520
But that comes from a lack
of understanding of how
human beings interact with

6027
02:30:34,521 --> 02:30:39,521
each other and about how a magnificent
a discovery so gigantic would be to the

6028
02:30:39,951 --> 02:30:41,420
one person that exposed it,

6029
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:44,930
but that person is going to keep their
mouth shut for what fucking reason.

6030
02:30:45,230 --> 02:30:45,710
What reason?

6031
02:30:45,710 --> 02:30:46,640
That's nonsense.

6032
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:48,210
I will say with that in mind,

6033
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:54,200
there is a thing that when you interview
a white lady or a black dude for a job,

6034
02:30:54,780 --> 02:30:58,920
a lot of times your
predispositions towards those
races or genders go in and go

6035
02:30:58,921 --> 02:30:59,130
like,

6036
02:30:59,130 --> 02:31:01,500
I don't respect you as
much as your mind is there.

6037
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:03,720
I kind of like disrespect you a little.

6038
02:31:03,721 --> 02:31:08,721
I don't think you have the brain that
someone who looks different has so now

6039
02:31:08,791 --> 02:31:11,340
you're like not letting them
get the part or get the job.

6040
02:31:11,341 --> 02:31:15,540
They would have gotten not the part that
Holly was so garbage part doesn't work

6041
02:31:15,541 --> 02:31:17,280
but the job because like ah,

6042
02:31:17,370 --> 02:31:18,630
really you're smart.

6043
02:31:18,631 --> 02:31:19,170
No.

6044
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:19,381
Right.

6045
02:31:19,381 --> 02:31:19,980
A woman's

6046
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:21,150
going to do the best job,

6047
02:31:21,190 --> 02:31:22,023
get the fuck out.

6048
02:31:22,110 --> 02:31:24,900
Whenever you see like a an actor who
goes on to like write and direct his own

6049
02:31:24,901 --> 02:31:25,830
thing and like what?

6050
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:27,630
Because most actors are fucking idiots.

6051
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:27,841
Right.

6052
02:31:27,841 --> 02:31:29,090
And when you see when
it's actually intelligent,

6053
02:31:29,091 --> 02:31:30,480
like I would not have
expected that from you.

6054
02:31:30,510 --> 02:31:32,010
And that happens also
with race and gender,

6055
02:31:32,190 --> 02:31:33,810
so that you do want to correct.

6056
02:31:33,930 --> 02:31:34,291
Yes.

6057
02:31:34,291 --> 02:31:36,720
Well that's what Billy Bob
Thornton did with Slingblade.

6058
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:38,580
He couldn't get jobs made his own.

6059
02:31:38,610 --> 02:31:39,181
So he decided,

6060
02:31:39,181 --> 02:31:42,000
you know what have this
crazy character swingers.

6061
02:31:42,001 --> 02:31:42,720
Exactly.

6062
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:43,553
Jon Favreau,

6063
02:31:43,890 --> 02:31:45,540
they decided to make his own movie.

6064
02:31:45,570 --> 02:31:46,110
Rocky.

6065
02:31:46,110 --> 02:31:46,680
Yeah.

6066
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:47,880
I mean sort of.

6067
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:48,201
Well,

6068
02:31:48,201 --> 02:31:50,910
he just made sure he played and
he wrote it and he wrote it.

6069
02:31:50,911 --> 02:31:51,660
Yeah,

6070
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:54,870
but you did go to a major studio,

6071
02:31:55,140 --> 02:31:56,130
but you,

6072
02:31:56,210 --> 02:31:59,010
you can't mandate creativity.

6073
02:31:59,070 --> 02:32:01,240
Creativity is a different
element because like,

6074
02:32:01,530 --> 02:32:04,220
look how many fucking books is
Stephen King written about Maine.

6075
02:32:04,690 --> 02:32:06,240
Like every other book,

6076
02:32:06,241 --> 02:32:06,841
it's about Maine.

6077
02:32:06,841 --> 02:32:09,690
You can't tell him he can't write a
book about Maine because people from

6078
02:32:10,350 --> 02:32:10,891
Kenosha,

6079
02:32:10,891 --> 02:32:13,600
Wisconsin are upset and
they think that you're,

6080
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:14,160
you know,

6081
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:15,030
your location.

6082
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:18,750
But I do like what they're doing in the
UK and they're like the first year of

6083
02:32:18,751 --> 02:32:19,500
Black Mirror,

6084
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:20,670
which was UK based.

6085
02:32:22,140 --> 02:32:22,680
They don't,

6086
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:25,480
they just let black guys play roles.

6087
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:25,921
It's not,

6088
02:32:25,921 --> 02:32:27,240
they're not playing black person.

6089
02:32:27,300 --> 02:32:27,871
They're just like,

6090
02:32:27,871 --> 02:32:29,100
there's mixed race couples.

6091
02:32:29,130 --> 02:32:29,640
They're just,

6092
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:30,630
they're just people.

6093
02:32:30,930 --> 02:32:32,730
They're way further along
than we are in terms of that.

6094
02:32:32,731 --> 02:32:35,430
And so as a social consciousness
of the design guys in general,

6095
02:32:35,431 --> 02:32:38,940
they don't see race as
the European English,

6096
02:32:39,030 --> 02:32:39,510
English,

6097
02:32:39,510 --> 02:32:40,343
you know,

6098
02:32:40,520 --> 02:32:41,353
they say they see,

6099
02:32:41,380 --> 02:32:44,010
they see the ends and
Pakistanis and stuff like that.

6100
02:32:44,011 --> 02:32:46,260
They see that race really hard still.

6101
02:32:46,320 --> 02:32:47,850
We actually probably see that less.

6102
02:32:48,180 --> 02:32:49,560
But in terms of black and white,

6103
02:32:49,580 --> 02:32:50,060
they're there,

6104
02:32:50,060 --> 02:32:51,000
which is way more like,

6105
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:51,950
oh there's people.

6106
02:32:52,470 --> 02:32:53,190
Um,

6107
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:55,970
that's interesting cause they don't
have a history of slavery like we did

6108
02:32:57,660 --> 02:32:58,081
earlier.

6109
02:32:58,081 --> 02:32:58,651
I'm not sure.

6110
02:32:58,651 --> 02:33:02,900
I mean way back they had the more
[inaudible] Shakespeare but like I dunno,

6111
02:33:02,910 --> 02:33:03,960
it's just not as bad as us.

6112
02:33:04,290 --> 02:33:04,620
Right.

6113
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:05,311
For whatever reason,

6114
02:33:05,311 --> 02:33:06,360
I'm not really sure the causes.

6115
02:33:06,390 --> 02:33:07,200
But then people,

6116
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:09,090
black guys can just play a role.

6117
02:33:09,270 --> 02:33:10,860
You understand an
argument about that with,

6118
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:13,590
with Black Mirror that I
found was kind of silly.

6119
02:33:13,591 --> 02:33:14,190
Someone was saying,

6120
02:33:14,190 --> 02:33:14,401
Oh,

6121
02:33:14,401 --> 02:33:18,930
I'm upset about black mirror because
it's like every show has a woman lead in

6122
02:33:18,931 --> 02:33:19,291
every show.

6123
02:33:19,291 --> 02:33:22,320
I go step away and look at the shows,

6124
02:33:22,321 --> 02:33:23,640
they're fucking fantastic.

6125
02:33:23,660 --> 02:33:25,440
Is that good?

6126
02:33:25,441 --> 02:33:25,621
Yeah.

6127
02:33:25,621 --> 02:33:26,160
Why do you,

6128
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:31,160
but that's someone who was so upset
by this whole idea of diversity and in

6129
02:33:31,291 --> 02:33:35,250
forced diversity that they're looking for
it even when it's not relevant because

6130
02:33:35,251 --> 02:33:36,720
th the actual work itself,

6131
02:33:36,721 --> 02:33:37,350
it's so good.

6132
02:33:37,350 --> 02:33:40,650
She's like you shouldn't say the new
Ghostbusters suck cause it was all women.

6133
02:33:40,710 --> 02:33:40,850
Right.

6134
02:33:40,850 --> 02:33:44,160
You said the new Ghostbusters suck because
no one was calling for a remake of it

6135
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:45,570
and it sucked.

6136
02:33:45,570 --> 02:33:46,980
Or Star Wars,

6137
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:48,180
the new star wars.

6138
02:33:48,181 --> 02:33:49,790
Like when you had uh,

6139
02:33:49,830 --> 02:33:53,940
Carrie Fisher and Laura dern were like
the major generals and you're like what?

6140
02:33:54,660 --> 02:33:55,860
This doesn't even work.

6141
02:33:56,010 --> 02:34:00,330
Like maybe it doesn't work because it
wasn't written well and because they

6142
02:34:00,331 --> 02:34:01,560
didn't really pull it off.

6143
02:34:01,590 --> 02:34:05,340
But you're telling me you couldn't have
some bad ass chick like Sigourney weaver

6144
02:34:05,341 --> 02:34:08,700
when she was in aliens who dominated
the film and nobody gave a fuck that she

6145
02:34:08,701 --> 02:34:10,980
was the lead and we look
up cause it was so good.

6146
02:34:11,450 --> 02:34:12,181
He was so good.

6147
02:34:12,181 --> 02:34:13,770
The blonde chick is from game of Thrones.

6148
02:34:13,950 --> 02:34:14,311
Perfect.

6149
02:34:14,311 --> 02:34:15,840
Cause you know and Searcy's yes,

6150
02:34:16,230 --> 02:34:17,470
there are no one's like,

6151
02:34:17,550 --> 02:34:18,190
oh yeah,

6152
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:18,700
whatever.

6153
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:20,410
It's like no one thinks of them is women.

6154
02:34:20,411 --> 02:34:21,800
They're just like strong characters.

6155
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:25,240
Omar from the wire who was gay and black,

6156
02:34:25,660 --> 02:34:29,620
like no one cares because it
was just like he nailed it.

6157
02:34:30,580 --> 02:34:31,600
But then how do you,

6158
02:34:31,810 --> 02:34:33,100
did you have to like,

6159
02:34:33,300 --> 02:34:36,880
like not see it and black who's going
to be great in this and also give a

6160
02:34:36,881 --> 02:34:37,750
representation of,

6161
02:34:37,930 --> 02:34:40,660
you can't make all the gangsters
white because it'd be unrealistic.

6162
02:34:41,140 --> 02:34:41,651
You know what I mean?

6163
02:34:41,651 --> 02:34:43,540
We've seen this in comedy too,

6164
02:34:43,541 --> 02:34:43,900
right?

6165
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:48,490
We've seen there's a difference between
in forced diversity and people who just

6166
02:34:48,491 --> 02:34:49,570
happen to be diverse,

6167
02:34:49,571 --> 02:34:50,404
but our brilliant,

6168
02:34:50,680 --> 02:34:51,220
true,

6169
02:34:51,220 --> 02:34:55,720
and we've seen this where they're trying
to enforce like certain aspects of

6170
02:34:55,780 --> 02:34:57,180
standard mustaches.

6171
02:34:57,190 --> 02:34:58,570
You're going to make your product worse.

6172
02:34:58,600 --> 02:34:59,050
Yeah.

6173
02:34:59,050 --> 02:34:59,860
Well we,

6174
02:34:59,860 --> 02:35:00,610
I mean,

6175
02:35:00,610 --> 02:35:01,840
how many times have we seen this?

6176
02:35:01,841 --> 02:35:02,800
And people will say,

6177
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:03,550
Hey,

6178
02:35:03,550 --> 02:35:03,791
you know,

6179
02:35:03,791 --> 02:35:06,700
why aren't there more women at the comedy
store and why aren't there more this?

6180
02:35:06,700 --> 02:35:07,750
Why aren't there more that?

6181
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:08,613
Whoops.

6182
02:35:09,010 --> 02:35:09,730
Oh yeah.

6183
02:35:09,730 --> 02:35:10,570
That lady who said like,

6184
02:35:10,610 --> 02:35:11,051
where'd he come?

6185
02:35:11,051 --> 02:35:12,310
He's only got three spots last month.

6186
02:35:12,311 --> 02:35:12,820
Explained that.

6187
02:35:12,820 --> 02:35:15,070
But where what you're doing is accusing,

6188
02:35:15,071 --> 02:35:17,050
but if you're actually asking
why would it come and go?

6189
02:35:17,140 --> 02:35:20,410
I got three spots last month is because
what it comes called in for three spots

6190
02:35:20,411 --> 02:35:21,190
last month,

6191
02:35:21,190 --> 02:35:22,930
she gets every spot she wanted.

6192
02:35:23,170 --> 02:35:25,060
She will tell you that if
you're asked to her face,

6193
02:35:25,450 --> 02:35:29,140
she's one of the ones
who long you don't get,

6194
02:35:29,141 --> 02:35:30,880
you don't call in and not get a spot.

6195
02:35:31,230 --> 02:35:33,340
There are certain people
that get the spots they want.

6196
02:35:33,670 --> 02:35:34,240
Yeah.

6197
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:35,440
So she's one of them.

6198
02:35:35,560 --> 02:35:35,771
Yeah.

6199
02:35:35,771 --> 02:35:37,300
So the answer is she's busy.

6200
02:35:37,330 --> 02:35:37,691
She has.

6201
02:35:37,691 --> 02:35:37,871
Yeah,

6202
02:35:37,871 --> 02:35:38,411
exactly.

6203
02:35:38,411 --> 02:35:40,030
The answer isn't causing sexism there.

6204
02:35:40,330 --> 02:35:42,820
Well that's nonsense though
that that kind of thinking.

6205
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:44,650
He almost always comes
from people who suck.

6206
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:46,090
If you look at their art,

6207
02:35:46,270 --> 02:35:47,830
they're almost always bad.

6208
02:35:48,730 --> 02:35:49,600
That's just a fact.

6209
02:35:49,601 --> 02:35:52,600
They want Liza about this recently.

6210
02:35:53,230 --> 02:35:53,681
It's not new.

6211
02:35:53,681 --> 02:35:55,510
It made me realize same
thing when Dan Cook up,

6212
02:35:55,511 --> 02:35:56,170
big people are like,

6213
02:35:56,170 --> 02:35:57,190
oh cause he's good looking.

6214
02:35:57,430 --> 02:36:01,090
And that was a bunch of sucky guys who
weren't killing every set like Dane was.

6215
02:36:01,150 --> 02:36:01,600
Sure.

6216
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:02,433
And they'll go on,

6217
02:36:02,650 --> 02:36:05,740
there must be a reason
other than it's on me.

6218
02:36:06,100 --> 02:36:07,780
Why I'm not as big as him.

6219
02:36:08,080 --> 02:36:10,090
So how about the good
looking thing that's off me?

6220
02:36:10,091 --> 02:36:11,240
I have no control over that.

6221
02:36:11,650 --> 02:36:12,370
And it's really like,

6222
02:36:12,370 --> 02:36:12,581
dude,

6223
02:36:12,581 --> 02:36:16,310
that Guy Kills 19 Times at a 20
and you kill two out of 20 yeah.

6224
02:36:16,580 --> 02:36:19,570
Like can you possibly say
it could be based on that,

6225
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:22,870
but it's the people that are complaining
are almost never doing well anyway.

6226
02:36:22,871 --> 02:36:24,460
So this is why they complaining.

6227
02:36:25,240 --> 02:36:25,601
I mean,

6228
02:36:25,601 --> 02:36:25,831
what,

6229
02:36:25,831 --> 02:36:26,170
what's,

6230
02:36:26,170 --> 02:36:26,591
what's going,

6231
02:36:26,591 --> 02:36:29,110
I mean you're not going
to hear certain people.

6232
02:36:29,110 --> 02:36:31,590
You're going to hear a bill burr
complaining about other people don't.

6233
02:36:31,591 --> 02:36:32,370
Chappelle said it,

6234
02:36:32,370 --> 02:36:33,100
it goes,

6235
02:36:33,100 --> 02:36:33,760
I mean,

6236
02:36:33,760 --> 02:36:35,200
black comics who do well,

6237
02:36:35,260 --> 02:36:37,090
they're all successful hugely.

6238
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:37,720
You guys.

6239
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:41,620
If you're doing well on stage
consistently as a black comic,

6240
02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:42,970
there's no question you'll be,

6241
02:36:43,030 --> 02:36:43,863
you'll be doing,

6242
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,130
you'll be making doctor money.

6243
02:36:45,160 --> 02:36:45,731
He didn't say that,

6244
02:36:45,731 --> 02:36:46,840
but like that's what it is.

6245
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:47,610
That's what it is.

6246
02:36:47,610 --> 02:36:48,340
Yeah.

6247
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:53,340
Well comedy in many ways is
very egalitarian in that way.

6248
02:36:53,950 --> 02:36:54,510
Last year.

6249
02:36:54,510 --> 02:36:55,040
Yeah.

6250
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:55,840
I mean,

6251
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:57,040
you are what you are,

6252
02:36:57,041 --> 02:36:57,220
you know,

6253
02:36:57,220 --> 02:36:58,690
either you're really funny or you're not.

6254
02:36:58,720 --> 02:37:00,010
And those black rooms of black comics,

6255
02:37:00,011 --> 02:37:00,910
it was something it's like,

6256
02:37:00,940 --> 02:37:03,780
so like I'm in that doesn't
relate to certain white audiences.

6257
02:37:03,790 --> 02:37:04,930
Like I just can't figure it up.

6258
02:37:04,931 --> 02:37:05,870
But there's rooms for them.

6259
02:37:05,900 --> 02:37:07,990
There's a lot of the Mexican rooms
where they do half their pumps lines in

6260
02:37:07,991 --> 02:37:08,480
Spanish.

6261
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:10,330
That wouldn't play the comedy store,

6262
02:37:10,331 --> 02:37:13,570
but it would play in certain
audiences as used to do Miami.

6263
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:15,010
He would do Spanglish.

6264
02:37:15,380 --> 02:37:17,780
He would have his punchlines to be in
Spanish and people would follow the

6265
02:37:17,781 --> 02:37:18,710
fucking chair laughing.

6266
02:37:19,720 --> 02:37:22,130
And if you were a white
guy who didn't swear,

6267
02:37:22,250 --> 02:37:23,480
good luck.

6268
02:37:23,870 --> 02:37:24,201
Good luck.

6269
02:37:24,201 --> 02:37:25,070
Jump out a window.

6270
02:37:25,100 --> 02:37:25,730
That was another thing.

6271
02:37:25,730 --> 02:37:25,851
Oh,

6272
02:37:25,851 --> 02:37:26,361
you're dirty.

6273
02:37:26,361 --> 02:37:27,200
That's why he's successful.

6274
02:37:27,710 --> 02:37:28,191
That's a big thing,

6275
02:37:28,191 --> 02:37:28,550
man.

6276
02:37:28,550 --> 02:37:30,590
Just start crushing and
it's won't be an issue.

6277
02:37:30,710 --> 02:37:31,340
Yeah.

6278
02:37:31,340 --> 02:37:33,260
Well that was a nonsense issue to like,

6279
02:37:33,261 --> 02:37:34,610
I don't want to fall someone dirty.

6280
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:34,880
Yeah.

6281
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:35,720
Why not?

6282
02:37:35,940 --> 02:37:36,450
Yeah.

6283
02:37:36,450 --> 02:37:36,710
Why?

6284
02:37:36,710 --> 02:37:37,830
What difference does it have?

6285
02:37:38,030 --> 02:37:39,200
But this idea that like,

6286
02:37:39,350 --> 02:37:40,490
I'm not getting a hook as a reason.

6287
02:37:40,491 --> 02:37:41,324
It's not new.

6288
02:37:42,110 --> 02:37:45,260
This has been going on as
a reason to be like off me,

6289
02:37:45,261 --> 02:37:46,160
why I'm not doing well.

6290
02:37:46,180 --> 02:37:46,610
Yeah,

6291
02:37:46,610 --> 02:37:47,443
and it does.

6292
02:37:47,510 --> 02:37:49,220
I think the real sexism,

6293
02:37:49,910 --> 02:37:53,240
especially for women is having to work
with a bunch of people that are trying to

6294
02:37:53,241 --> 02:37:54,350
fuck you all the time.

6295
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:59,540
Especially I think at open mics when
you're already ready to quit anyway.

6296
02:37:59,640 --> 02:37:59,960
Yeah,

6297
02:37:59,960 --> 02:38:01,040
you're about ready to quit.

6298
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:02,660
And now this fucking,

6299
02:38:02,661 --> 02:38:04,820
these creeps around and
there's no one to talk to.

6300
02:38:04,821 --> 02:38:07,480
What the fucking call the
coffee shop on the homeless.

6301
02:38:07,540 --> 02:38:10,340
I mean for real homeless
people line up for open mics.

6302
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:13,980
There's a giant percentage of them
that are out of their fucking mind.

6303
02:38:13,981 --> 02:38:17,570
So if you're some girl who already feels
vulnerable around men to begin with

6304
02:38:17,571 --> 02:38:22,571
because you're smaller and you know
you're a target for sexual harassment

6305
02:38:22,601 --> 02:38:23,770
manager to go talk to them like,

6306
02:38:23,771 --> 02:38:23,891
Hey,

6307
02:38:23,891 --> 02:38:24,561
this guy's fucking,

6308
02:38:24,561 --> 02:38:25,400
can you walk me to my car?

6309
02:38:25,490 --> 02:38:26,270
No rules.

6310
02:38:26,270 --> 02:38:26,451
You know,

6311
02:38:26,451 --> 02:38:27,051
sign up.

6312
02:38:27,051 --> 02:38:28,520
There's 30 other people sign up.

6313
02:38:28,521 --> 02:38:30,350
You wait around for
your name to be called.

6314
02:38:30,650 --> 02:38:31,311
If you're lucky,

6315
02:38:31,311 --> 02:38:33,320
you get three minutes and
you're still no matter what,

6316
02:38:33,321 --> 02:38:35,180
five years away from making a dollar.

6317
02:38:35,180 --> 02:38:35,601
So it's like,

6318
02:38:35,601 --> 02:38:36,380
you know what,

6319
02:38:36,380 --> 02:38:36,921
fuck it,

6320
02:38:36,921 --> 02:38:37,670
I'm done.

6321
02:38:37,670 --> 02:38:39,950
If Mary Lynn Rice Cup today gets harassed,

6322
02:38:40,310 --> 02:38:41,390
she's not going to quit.

6323
02:38:41,610 --> 02:38:42,590
It's still making money.

6324
02:38:42,700 --> 02:38:43,070
Right.

6325
02:38:43,070 --> 02:38:43,371
You know,

6326
02:38:43,371 --> 02:38:43,660
she'll,

6327
02:38:43,660 --> 02:38:46,130
she might not come to the store anymore
if nobody does anything about it.

6328
02:38:46,530 --> 02:38:47,300
Um,

6329
02:38:47,300 --> 02:38:48,250
but people would do,

6330
02:38:48,260 --> 02:38:50,360
so there's a place to go to for like,

6331
02:38:50,361 --> 02:38:52,700
hey you need to get rid of this guy and
this audience member can't come anymore.

6332
02:38:52,760 --> 02:38:54,020
And that's just comedy.

6333
02:38:54,021 --> 02:38:57,500
I mean with any job issue.

6334
02:38:57,830 --> 02:38:59,030
Well also with men,

6335
02:38:59,031 --> 02:39:00,230
men are fucking stupid.

6336
02:39:00,231 --> 02:39:00,740
Okay.

6337
02:39:00,740 --> 02:39:03,120
If you're working with a man and a,

6338
02:39:03,121 --> 02:39:04,370
you're nice that man,

6339
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:08,730
he assumes you want to fuck him cause
this how this is evolution worked.

6340
02:39:08,820 --> 02:39:09,050
Yeah,

6341
02:39:09,050 --> 02:39:10,310
we're monkeys just my arm and it's like,

6342
02:39:10,570 --> 02:39:11,630
oh for the next two days,

6343
02:39:12,270 --> 02:39:15,530
if a woman is like kind to
a guy and get some coffee,

6344
02:39:15,860 --> 02:39:19,310
the guy thinks she wants to suck his dick
cause he's stupid because this is how

6345
02:39:19,311 --> 02:39:19,910
we're programmed.

6346
02:39:19,910 --> 02:39:22,370
We're programmed to think
that women who are nice to us,

6347
02:39:22,430 --> 02:39:23,780
if that woman is attractive,

6348
02:39:24,020 --> 02:39:25,190
she must be sending a signal.

6349
02:39:25,191 --> 02:39:26,330
She wants sexual attention.

6350
02:39:26,510 --> 02:39:30,200
It can't just be some completely
platonic workplace situation.

6351
02:39:30,230 --> 02:39:33,590
That's not possible because eight hours
a day when you're working with someone,

6352
02:39:33,770 --> 02:39:37,070
you develop feelings and thoughts
and ideas about that person.

6353
02:39:37,130 --> 02:39:38,190
I realized that we're not,

6354
02:39:38,191 --> 02:39:39,440
we're doing the nastiest show,

6355
02:39:39,630 --> 02:39:41,340
the Montreal and a,

6356
02:39:41,341 --> 02:39:42,980
there's all these young interns,

6357
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:46,490
some of them women and young
people are cuter than old people.

6358
02:39:47,580 --> 02:39:48,500
I don't know to tell you,

6359
02:39:49,010 --> 02:39:53,570
I'll stand by all your wants to
fucking talk to every magazine

6360
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:59,340
and you get this idea and you're there
a week early from everybody else in

6361
02:39:59,341 --> 02:39:59,571
Nancy.

6362
02:39:59,571 --> 02:40:00,470
She'll start to weight earlier,

6363
02:40:00,471 --> 02:40:03,110
so you're pretty much the only English
speaking show while the French stuff is

6364
02:40:03,111 --> 02:40:06,410
going on and these interns
come out and you're like,

6365
02:40:06,440 --> 02:40:06,771
Ooh,

6366
02:40:06,771 --> 02:40:08,030
I think I can fuck one of them.

6367
02:40:08,090 --> 02:40:09,080
And then it hit me like,

6368
02:40:09,140 --> 02:40:09,441
oh wait,

6369
02:40:09,441 --> 02:40:13,100
there's also male interns who also
showing up to the shows and you're like,

6370
02:40:13,410 --> 02:40:13,531
oh,

6371
02:40:13,531 --> 02:40:13,980
they're all just

6372
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:18,980
comedy fans and I'm reading
in these wind maci flirting.

6373
02:40:19,570 --> 02:40:23,010
Whereas they're coming when they're
exhibiting the literally the exact same

6374
02:40:23,011 --> 02:40:25,260
behavior as the men who are coming,

6375
02:40:26,050 --> 02:40:26,760
coming to like,

6376
02:40:26,760 --> 02:40:30,630
I want to hang out with the
comedian and they might want hook,

6377
02:40:30,670 --> 02:40:31,500
they might not,

6378
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:35,430
but I'm putting something on them only
because of their gender and then it's

6379
02:40:35,431 --> 02:40:35,610
like,

6380
02:40:35,610 --> 02:40:35,821
okay,

6381
02:40:35,821 --> 02:40:36,451
step back.

6382
02:40:36,451 --> 02:40:37,560
You can't fuck any of these people.

6383
02:40:38,120 --> 02:40:38,780
Yeah.

6384
02:40:38,780 --> 02:40:43,170
That's must be what it's like if you're
the manager of an office and there's a

6385
02:40:43,171 --> 02:40:48,060
cute woman who works for you and a guy
who's fat and gross and they're both

6386
02:40:48,061 --> 02:40:50,700
exhibiting the exact same
friendly behavior towards you.

6387
02:40:50,850 --> 02:40:51,830
You don't assume the fact,

6388
02:40:51,840 --> 02:40:52,800
I want to suck your Dick.

6389
02:40:52,830 --> 02:40:53,280
Right.

6390
02:40:53,280 --> 02:40:53,760
And then,

6391
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:56,220
and then also it's like
if you can still hook up,

6392
02:40:56,340 --> 02:40:57,570
but they have to do all the work.

6393
02:40:57,571 --> 02:40:59,290
The underling has to
do all the pushing you,

6394
02:40:59,291 --> 02:41:01,650
even though I don't think you
can in an office environment,

6395
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:04,040
I think of the underling
keeps pushing there.

6396
02:41:04,100 --> 02:41:04,801
They have good push,

6397
02:41:04,801 --> 02:41:05,700
hard to push on.

6398
02:41:05,730 --> 02:41:05,991
You can,

6399
02:41:05,991 --> 02:41:06,601
you can be like,

6400
02:41:06,601 --> 02:41:07,381
what are you doing this weekend?

6401
02:41:07,381 --> 02:41:08,910
And every body I was like,

6402
02:41:09,070 --> 02:41:09,621
I'm going to move.

6403
02:41:09,621 --> 02:41:10,440
You want to come like,

6404
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:11,101
oh sure.

6405
02:41:11,101 --> 02:41:11,910
Anybody else want to cut?

6406
02:41:11,910 --> 02:41:15,510
Like you have to like really not
push and put them in a position.

6407
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:16,260
Mm.

6408
02:41:16,260 --> 02:41:16,681
Yeah.

6409
02:41:16,681 --> 02:41:19,020
And there's people going to take
advantage of that on both sides.

6410
02:41:19,180 --> 02:41:19,680
Yeah.

6411
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:21,180
And even on the female side,

6412
02:41:21,250 --> 02:41:21,510
um,

6413
02:41:21,510 --> 02:41:23,770
there's a friend of mine
who works at vice and uh,

6414
02:41:23,820 --> 02:41:28,170
he was talking to me about this woman
who was making these like really obvious,

6415
02:41:28,490 --> 02:41:29,323
um,

6416
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:32,333
advances.

6417
02:41:32,400 --> 02:41:35,460
She was trying to have
sex with him and uh,

6418
02:41:35,580 --> 02:41:40,580
he contacted one of the other guys that
he works with that is also there and

6419
02:41:41,050 --> 02:41:41,520
he's like,

6420
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:43,230
do not fuck her.

6421
02:41:43,590 --> 02:41:45,750
Like she is upwardly mobile.

6422
02:41:45,870 --> 02:41:46,661
Like what she was doing,

6423
02:41:46,661 --> 02:41:48,300
she tried to fuck her way up to the top.

6424
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:52,110
She did it to this guy and then she
called sexual harassment on him after she

6425
02:41:52,111 --> 02:41:56,700
flirted with him and
he's got some fucking,

6426
02:41:56,790 --> 02:41:59,990
some advance that she
shouldn't have and some,

6427
02:42:00,060 --> 02:42:01,710
some nonsense when people are political.

6428
02:42:01,740 --> 02:42:05,340
Some people are very calculated and some
people are sociopaths and they exist

6429
02:42:05,341 --> 02:42:06,180
with vaginas.

6430
02:42:06,181 --> 02:42:07,260
They exist with penises.

6431
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:09,120
It's just this is part of being a person.

6432
02:42:09,121 --> 02:42:10,590
There's some people that
are just bad people,

6433
02:42:10,620 --> 02:42:13,710
but there's also some women who were
like power and that's not wrong.

6434
02:42:14,670 --> 02:42:14,791
Oh,

6435
02:42:14,791 --> 02:42:15,570
you're a manager.

6436
02:42:15,570 --> 02:42:16,000
Right.

6437
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,150
It's justifiably,

6438
02:42:17,170 --> 02:42:18,690
makes me want to fuck you a little more.

6439
02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:20,040
And so that's okay too.

6440
02:42:20,070 --> 02:42:20,610
Yeah.

6441
02:42:20,610 --> 02:42:23,520
And well there's some women also that
like being in power and we hate those

6442
02:42:23,521 --> 02:42:23,910
women,

6443
02:42:23,910 --> 02:42:26,050
but we don't hate the men
who like to be empowered.

6444
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:28,680
That's a weird thing to like
a woman wants to run shit.

6445
02:42:28,681 --> 02:42:28,891
We're like,

6446
02:42:28,891 --> 02:42:30,660
look at this crazy bitch
wanting to run everything.

6447
02:42:30,870 --> 02:42:34,050
Whereas a guy who wants to
run shit seems totally normal.

6448
02:42:34,380 --> 02:42:36,090
I will say it's a bigger wrong,

6449
02:42:38,250 --> 02:42:40,500
it's like what are you
most likely want to avoid?

6450
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:41,370
You know,

6451
02:42:41,370 --> 02:42:45,150
and it seems like a bigger
wrong for someone to have
to like worry about getting

6452
02:42:45,151 --> 02:42:45,720
fucking,

6453
02:42:45,720 --> 02:42:49,770
not just being able to
do their job versus Oh,

6454
02:42:49,771 --> 02:42:51,480
this chick wants to sleep with me
because she wants to get ahead.

6455
02:42:51,750 --> 02:42:51,961
Yeah.

6456
02:42:51,961 --> 02:42:54,330
Well that's easy to avoid
is for the guidance.

6457
02:42:54,360 --> 02:42:55,620
There's no physical threat,

6458
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:56,833
eh,

6459
02:42:57,060 --> 02:42:58,590
there's never a physical
threat from that guy.

6460
02:42:58,860 --> 02:42:59,270
Feel like,

6461
02:42:59,270 --> 02:43:00,450
well I got my ass grabs like,

6462
02:43:00,510 --> 02:43:03,120
and you could end it anytime
he wants to not come on.

6463
02:43:03,210 --> 02:43:03,900
Stop it.

6464
02:43:03,900 --> 02:43:08,610
I mean in last year to like
really a mess and you know,

6465
02:43:08,820 --> 02:43:11,040
you've just vulnerable psychologically,

6466
02:43:11,050 --> 02:43:11,960
physically all the time.

6467
02:43:12,030 --> 02:43:12,340
Bubs,

6468
02:43:12,340 --> 02:43:14,780
you're an aberration or an operation.

6469
02:43:14,781 --> 02:43:15,460
Yeah.

6470
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:16,293
Yeah.

6471
02:43:16,940 --> 02:43:18,020
I don't know how to correct it.

6472
02:43:18,580 --> 02:43:21,610
We're lucky we don't have to
work with people all day man.

6473
02:43:21,820 --> 02:43:24,310
Beat people in a fucking
office environment.

6474
02:43:24,610 --> 02:43:28,990
They're working around people all
day and people have some weird shit.

6475
02:43:28,991 --> 02:43:33,070
And then you go to the company Christmas
party and some guy who works with your

6476
02:43:33,071 --> 02:43:36,730
wife's had some creepy shit to
you cause you know he's been like,

6477
02:43:36,850 --> 02:43:41,590
he's been coveting your wife behind your
back and you know he wants her and you

6478
02:43:41,591 --> 02:43:42,100
know he's,

6479
02:43:42,100 --> 02:43:46,960
he talks shit about you to her and she
tells you and that kind of shit is so

6480
02:43:46,961 --> 02:43:47,794
normal man.

6481
02:43:47,890 --> 02:43:50,260
Because you think about how
many hours are in a day,

6482
02:43:50,310 --> 02:43:51,790
you have 24 hours in a day.

6483
02:43:51,791 --> 02:43:52,720
Eight of them you're sleeping.

6484
02:43:52,750 --> 02:43:53,230
Okay.

6485
02:43:53,230 --> 02:43:55,180
So how much time is commuting?

6486
02:43:55,270 --> 02:43:56,290
How much time is work?

6487
02:43:56,410 --> 02:43:58,150
Most of your day is at work,

6488
02:43:58,210 --> 02:44:00,550
so your life is not what your spouse,

6489
02:44:00,820 --> 02:44:01,900
you might not hook up with them,

6490
02:44:01,901 --> 02:44:05,500
but you were interacting with them
and then the disproportionate way,

6491
02:44:05,570 --> 02:44:06,403
yeah.

6492
02:44:06,850 --> 02:44:09,860
Do you think with people sometimes
talk about me to going too far,

6493
02:44:09,861 --> 02:44:13,220
but let's talk about for a second
like me to going the right level.

6494
02:44:13,280 --> 02:44:14,030
Do you think,

6495
02:44:14,030 --> 02:44:15,080
and we don't work in an office job,

6496
02:44:15,081 --> 02:44:16,010
so we're just guessing,

6497
02:44:16,070 --> 02:44:16,903
right?

6498
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:19,670
You think sexual harassments
or down now and last year,

6499
02:44:19,940 --> 02:44:23,630
men who are creeps are probably
a little more cautious.

6500
02:44:23,631 --> 02:44:25,280
I remember after them and see a video,

6501
02:44:26,540 --> 02:44:28,070
people all over open Mikes,

6502
02:44:28,071 --> 02:44:29,270
we're calling each other out on it.

6503
02:44:29,630 --> 02:44:30,170
Yeah.

6504
02:44:30,170 --> 02:44:33,470
And then occasionally it was
a question of it went too far.

6505
02:44:33,471 --> 02:44:33,801
We were like,

6506
02:44:33,801 --> 02:44:34,610
you stole that joke from,

6507
02:44:34,610 --> 02:44:34,821
it's like,

6508
02:44:34,821 --> 02:44:38,060
do we both talked about the same movie
and you're trying to write me off my

6509
02:44:38,061 --> 02:44:39,740
whole career off because I talked about,

6510
02:44:40,050 --> 02:44:40,610
uh,

6511
02:44:40,610 --> 02:44:41,443
you know,

6512
02:44:41,810 --> 02:44:43,880
whatever gets with wolves and so are you.

6513
02:44:43,881 --> 02:44:45,580
But your thing was about
the native Americans do,

6514
02:44:45,581 --> 02:44:47,950
your thing was about the fucking co,

6515
02:44:48,040 --> 02:44:48,260
you know,

6516
02:44:48,260 --> 02:44:49,460
the dog they had.

6517
02:44:49,940 --> 02:44:51,530
And so I'm sure it went
too far here or there,

6518
02:44:51,531 --> 02:44:55,580
but it was nice where it like it was
no longer acceptable to steal jokes.

6519
02:44:55,581 --> 02:44:56,414
Yes.

6520
02:44:56,450 --> 02:44:58,700
And it wasn't just something
we're going to tolerate.

6521
02:44:58,730 --> 02:44:59,120
Right.

6522
02:44:59,120 --> 02:45:00,260
It's gotta be like that too.

6523
02:45:00,261 --> 02:45:01,100
With this meat to stuff.

6524
02:45:01,130 --> 02:45:03,380
It's no longer acceptable
that fucking patent ass.

6525
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:03,891
Exactly.

6526
02:45:03,891 --> 02:45:06,200
When you can be like wood or I
just wanted to an everyone else.

6527
02:45:06,410 --> 02:45:07,071
Even the guys like,

6528
02:45:07,071 --> 02:45:07,341
dude,

6529
02:45:07,341 --> 02:45:07,971
no dude,

6530
02:45:07,971 --> 02:45:11,630
I couldn't imagine being a
man where rather than reality,

6531
02:45:11,800 --> 02:45:16,800
I couldn't imagine being a woman working
for a man who wanted to fuck me and me

6532
02:45:17,081 --> 02:45:18,940
getting a raise,

6533
02:45:18,941 --> 02:45:23,941
me getting some sort of a upward movement
in my career is dependent upon this

6534
02:45:24,131 --> 02:45:27,310
person making a decision and this
person is always trying to fuck me.

6535
02:45:27,670 --> 02:45:28,750
That'd be disgusting.

6536
02:45:28,870 --> 02:45:32,320
And that's what a lot of women have to
deal with all day long and that's only

6537
02:45:32,321 --> 02:45:33,310
one step of it.

6538
02:45:33,430 --> 02:45:35,350
How about the fucking Bill Cosby step?

6539
02:45:35,530 --> 02:45:38,950
How about you can't leave
your fucking drink alone.

6540
02:45:39,320 --> 02:45:40,450
You can't leave your drink.

6541
02:45:40,451 --> 02:45:42,040
That's a reality with a lot of women.

6542
02:45:42,130 --> 02:45:43,690
That's not a reality with you or me.

6543
02:45:44,070 --> 02:45:45,490
When I was trying to rape us.

6544
02:45:46,100 --> 02:45:46,933
Fuck.

6545
02:45:48,090 --> 02:45:50,880
I mean there's a lot of shit that women
have to think about that we don't have

6546
02:45:50,881 --> 02:45:51,990
to think about a lot.

6547
02:45:52,140 --> 02:45:52,531
Many,

6548
02:45:52,531 --> 02:45:52,801
many,

6549
02:45:52,801 --> 02:45:53,101
many,

6550
02:45:53,101 --> 02:45:53,401
many,

6551
02:45:53,401 --> 02:45:53,671
many,

6552
02:45:53,671 --> 02:45:53,971
many,

6553
02:45:53,971 --> 02:45:54,610
many things.

6554
02:45:54,610 --> 02:45:54,910
Yeah,

6555
02:45:54,910 --> 02:45:55,550
it is interesting.

6556
02:45:55,550 --> 02:45:56,670
This now is all coming up here.

6557
02:45:56,671 --> 02:45:57,161
Like what?

6558
02:45:57,161 --> 02:45:59,600
How many of you had some damn fuck.

6559
02:45:59,620 --> 02:46:00,490
It's worse than I thought.

6560
02:46:00,550 --> 02:46:03,580
A lot of it's too cause like you just
want to believe the best in the world and

6561
02:46:03,581 --> 02:46:06,580
people and so when you're
like this you're like,

6562
02:46:06,581 --> 02:46:07,090
no,

6563
02:46:07,090 --> 02:46:08,080
that can't happen that much.

6564
02:46:08,110 --> 02:46:09,830
It's not like you're problem,

6565
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:10,960
you're not doing it,

6566
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:13,700
but you just don't want to
believe that's so removed.

6567
02:46:13,790 --> 02:46:15,890
Probably some kid can
get chopped up by some,

6568
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:16,161
you know,

6569
02:46:16,161 --> 02:46:16,980
some monster,

6570
02:46:16,980 --> 02:46:17,440
right?

6571
02:46:17,440 --> 02:46:18,273
Like no,

6572
02:46:18,620 --> 02:46:19,160
right?

6573
02:46:19,160 --> 02:46:19,311
Yeah,

6574
02:46:19,311 --> 02:46:19,791
we're moving.

6575
02:46:19,791 --> 02:46:20,630
We don't see it as much.

6576
02:46:20,631 --> 02:46:21,770
It's not directed us.

6577
02:46:21,771 --> 02:46:23,420
So they've been fucked up worlds,

6578
02:46:23,421 --> 02:46:23,691
man.

6579
02:46:23,691 --> 02:46:24,441
Our world is,

6580
02:46:24,441 --> 02:46:25,610
everybody smokes pot.

6581
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:26,930
Almost everybody drinks,

6582
02:46:27,210 --> 02:46:27,580
you know,

6583
02:46:27,580 --> 02:46:28,610
everybody's a deviant.

6584
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:32,450
Everybody is impossible for
them to have a regular job.

6585
02:46:32,690 --> 02:46:35,270
Every single one of us
that successful as a comic,

6586
02:46:35,570 --> 02:46:39,890
it's virtually impossible for
any of us to have ever existed.

6587
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:41,840
In an office environment and survived.

6588
02:46:41,930 --> 02:46:42,763
Yeah,

6589
02:46:42,890 --> 02:46:44,000
we're too fucked up,

6590
02:46:44,480 --> 02:46:45,770
but we're perfect for comedy.

6591
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:46,671
You know what I mean?

6592
02:46:46,671 --> 02:46:47,504
So like us,

6593
02:46:48,110 --> 02:46:51,110
US talking about office politics
and office environments,

6594
02:46:51,140 --> 02:46:52,360
so we a fucking big deal.

6595
02:46:52,361 --> 02:46:53,540
It's really what it is.

6596
02:46:53,541 --> 02:46:53,990
Fools.

6597
02:46:53,990 --> 02:46:56,480
That's why I think it's funny
when people say like talk about,

6598
02:46:56,481 --> 02:46:56,721
I don't know,

6599
02:46:56,721 --> 02:46:57,800
Louie or something where it's like,

6600
02:46:58,490 --> 02:46:59,570
it was a comedy festival,

6601
02:46:59,571 --> 02:46:59,901
so it was,

6602
02:46:59,901 --> 02:47:01,040
it was at their job and it's like,

6603
02:47:01,100 --> 02:47:01,370
oh no,

6604
02:47:01,370 --> 02:47:01,551
no,

6605
02:47:01,551 --> 02:47:01,701
no,

6606
02:47:01,701 --> 02:47:01,820
no.

6607
02:47:01,820 --> 02:47:03,170
You just don't understand what comedy is.

6608
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:04,970
Safety issue.

6609
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:06,220
If it was a workplace then,

6610
02:47:06,260 --> 02:47:06,511
then,

6611
02:47:06,511 --> 02:47:07,370
then you would have to say like,

6612
02:47:07,371 --> 02:47:07,731
by the way,

6613
02:47:07,731 --> 02:47:09,770
actually do people do
coke at the workplace?

6614
02:47:09,830 --> 02:47:14,610
We're now job people actually consensually
fuck doing work at our workplace.

6615
02:47:14,630 --> 02:47:18,470
Like is that happens to a lot
of pot smoking at our workplace?

6616
02:47:18,490 --> 02:47:18,620
Yeah.

6617
02:47:18,620 --> 02:47:19,490
Like it's not,

6618
02:47:19,491 --> 02:47:20,001
it's not,

6619
02:47:20,001 --> 02:47:20,350
it's not.

6620
02:47:20,350 --> 02:47:24,590
Workplace has a designated pot-smoking
place and now where we are,

6621
02:47:24,591 --> 02:47:25,550
you're in the green room,

6622
02:47:25,640 --> 02:47:26,810
you can't fuck with anybody,

6623
02:47:26,990 --> 02:47:27,500
but you can,

6624
02:47:27,500 --> 02:47:28,333
you can't smoke.

6625
02:47:28,580 --> 02:47:29,413
Yeah.

6626
02:47:29,570 --> 02:47:30,020
It's not,

6627
02:47:30,020 --> 02:47:30,920
it's not a workplace.

6628
02:47:31,280 --> 02:47:31,910
It's not,

6629
02:47:31,910 --> 02:47:32,630
well,

6630
02:47:32,630 --> 02:47:34,250
you should still have
the rights to safety.

6631
02:47:34,310 --> 02:47:35,300
But it ain't a workplace.

6632
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:36,020
Well,

6633
02:47:36,020 --> 02:47:36,853
and you should,

6634
02:47:37,250 --> 02:47:37,831
it's all WWE.

6635
02:47:37,831 --> 02:47:38,810
Like here's the thing,

6636
02:47:39,020 --> 02:47:42,070
like say if you're Tom and Christina,

6637
02:47:42,260 --> 02:47:42,570
yeah.

6638
02:47:42,570 --> 02:47:43,790
You're married together.

6639
02:47:43,850 --> 02:47:44,120
Yeah.

6640
02:47:44,120 --> 02:47:45,590
You could fuck in the green room.

6641
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:49,310
Lock the door and who's going to stop
you so you could fuck at the workplace.

6642
02:47:49,400 --> 02:47:50,233
Yeah.

6643
02:47:50,270 --> 02:47:50,630
Yeah,

6644
02:47:50,630 --> 02:47:51,463
you could.

6645
02:47:51,530 --> 02:47:52,363
That's not an issue.

6646
02:47:52,510 --> 02:47:53,770
You people fucking agreement all the time.

6647
02:47:53,780 --> 02:47:54,351
Like they'd beat it.

6648
02:47:54,351 --> 02:47:55,011
This girl is coming in,

6649
02:47:55,011 --> 02:47:59,720
but you can't fuck if you know you're
the manager and she's a secretary and you

6650
02:47:59,721 --> 02:48:00,501
pull her into your office,

6651
02:48:00,501 --> 02:48:01,334
you get fired for that.

6652
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:02,450
Even if it's your wife,

6653
02:48:02,630 --> 02:48:03,500
you're not allowed to do that.

6654
02:48:03,880 --> 02:48:04,601
A real work.

6655
02:48:04,601 --> 02:48:06,200
You can't fuck fuck at work.

6656
02:48:06,420 --> 02:48:07,550
When we're Constanza got fired,

6657
02:48:07,551 --> 02:48:07,790
he goes,

6658
02:48:07,790 --> 02:48:09,200
is that not alone?

6659
02:48:09,260 --> 02:48:10,093
What did he do at work?

6660
02:48:11,450 --> 02:48:12,200
And then they were like,

6661
02:48:12,200 --> 02:48:13,310
we caught you on camera goes,

6662
02:48:13,370 --> 02:48:13,520
oh,

6663
02:48:13,520 --> 02:48:13,970
what I did,

6664
02:48:13,970 --> 02:48:14,661
was that a problem?

6665
02:48:14,661 --> 02:48:16,580
I didn't realize trying
to lie his way out of it.

6666
02:48:18,110 --> 02:48:18,560
Yeah.

6667
02:48:18,560 --> 02:48:19,310
Well,

6668
02:48:19,310 --> 02:48:21,410
I think people listen
to more and it's slow.

6669
02:48:21,440 --> 02:48:22,050
And I think at the,

6670
02:48:22,050 --> 02:48:22,291
the,

6671
02:48:22,291 --> 02:48:24,030
the conversation gets
sidetracked when you,

6672
02:48:24,140 --> 02:48:24,400
you,

6673
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:26,030
you hit on punishment too much.

6674
02:48:26,460 --> 02:48:27,590
When people hit on punishment,

6675
02:48:27,591 --> 02:48:28,610
like this person needs to go away.

6676
02:48:28,610 --> 02:48:28,821
It's like,

6677
02:48:28,821 --> 02:48:29,900
can we get back to the fucking,

6678
02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:30,980
same thing with Michael Vick.

6679
02:48:31,150 --> 02:48:33,850
It's when you're talking about
whether he should put that away.

6680
02:48:33,870 --> 02:48:34,341
Football,

6681
02:48:34,341 --> 02:48:34,581
it's like,

6682
02:48:34,581 --> 02:48:36,200
now you've sidetrack me from just saying,

6683
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:37,910
don't kill dogs.

6684
02:48:38,450 --> 02:48:39,320
I'm on your side.

6685
02:48:39,321 --> 02:48:39,920
But like,

6686
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:40,161
oh,

6687
02:48:40,161 --> 02:48:41,300
now you've sidetrack me to go.

6688
02:48:41,301 --> 02:48:41,411
No,

6689
02:48:41,411 --> 02:48:41,570
no.

6690
02:48:41,570 --> 02:48:42,560
He should be allowed to like football.

6691
02:48:42,561 --> 02:48:43,580
That has nothing to do with it.

6692
02:48:44,060 --> 02:48:47,420
Let's just get back always to the argument
like let's make it safer for chicks

6693
02:48:47,421 --> 02:48:48,254
in the workplace.

6694
02:48:48,470 --> 02:48:51,290
Let's not let a black guy and not
get hired when he's deserving.

6695
02:48:52,220 --> 02:48:52,550
You know,

6696
02:48:52,550 --> 02:48:53,720
let's fix that stuff.

6697
02:48:53,900 --> 02:48:56,030
The punishment side tracks as
you can still talk about it,

6698
02:48:56,031 --> 02:48:57,260
but not when you're emotional.

6699
02:48:57,320 --> 02:49:01,550
I think one thing that we've come within
this conversation as a job suck jobs

6700
02:49:01,551 --> 02:49:01,731
do,

6701
02:49:01,731 --> 02:49:04,190
so no one should have them
because if you have them,

6702
02:49:04,191 --> 02:49:05,720
people want to fuck
you that you work with.

6703
02:49:06,200 --> 02:49:06,740
Yeah.

6704
02:49:06,740 --> 02:49:07,441
I think the,

6705
02:49:07,441 --> 02:49:09,420
that's the solution when it's
like men need to shut up.

6706
02:49:09,421 --> 02:49:09,721
It's like,

6707
02:49:09,721 --> 02:49:09,961
all right,

6708
02:49:09,961 --> 02:49:12,250
well then we can't help you or
hurt you if in your shout out.

6709
02:49:12,270 --> 02:49:13,440
Those people are just,

6710
02:49:13,530 --> 02:49:14,370
there's French,

6711
02:49:14,371 --> 02:49:15,810
there's loud fringe people.

6712
02:49:15,811 --> 02:49:16,650
Like you know,

6713
02:49:17,210 --> 02:49:18,210
that's just one,

6714
02:49:18,211 --> 02:49:21,390
one of my favorite tweets that I saved
from this feminist woman that said,

6715
02:49:21,660 --> 02:49:25,260
all white males are trash
unless proven otherwise.

6716
02:49:25,500 --> 02:49:25,710
It's like,

6717
02:49:25,710 --> 02:49:26,440
okay,

6718
02:49:26,440 --> 02:49:27,520
well we're not going to have them,

6719
02:49:28,600 --> 02:49:29,433
but you want our help,

6720
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:30,353
so,

6721
02:49:30,370 --> 02:49:31,203
okay,

6722
02:49:31,550 --> 02:49:33,210
good luck with that
unless proven otherwise.

6723
02:49:33,510 --> 02:49:34,980
That's a ridiculous way to look at things.

6724
02:49:35,500 --> 02:49:37,920
What if a man said that
all women are constantly,

6725
02:49:37,921 --> 02:49:39,600
it's proven otherwise that's a bad person.

6726
02:49:39,630 --> 02:49:39,781
Well,

6727
02:49:39,781 --> 02:49:41,520
it's also like the answer to,

6728
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:41,970
I dunno,

6729
02:49:41,970 --> 02:49:42,281
White Dude,

6730
02:49:42,281 --> 02:49:43,390
he's been in charge forever,

6731
02:49:43,410 --> 02:49:47,280
is not fuck these people over
who I wasn't here for forever.

6732
02:49:47,300 --> 02:49:47,460
Right.

6733
02:49:47,460 --> 02:49:48,900
People just need to stop talking.

6734
02:49:48,920 --> 02:49:49,171
Yeah.

6735
02:49:49,171 --> 02:49:49,710
And it's like,

6736
02:49:49,710 --> 02:49:50,070
okay,

6737
02:49:50,070 --> 02:49:51,030
okay.

6738
02:49:51,340 --> 02:49:53,640
That's the answer is lack of racism,

6739
02:49:53,641 --> 02:49:54,474
lack of sex,

6740
02:49:54,810 --> 02:49:55,740
complete lack.

6741
02:49:56,040 --> 02:49:58,830
Even in judging white people,

6742
02:49:58,860 --> 02:50:00,330
even in judging white males,

6743
02:50:00,450 --> 02:50:04,080
even in judging white males in a
position of power like this should be no

6744
02:50:04,081 --> 02:50:04,591
racism.

6745
02:50:04,591 --> 02:50:08,040
There should be no discrimination and
people should be presidential candidate

6746
02:50:08,070 --> 02:50:08,491
early,

6747
02:50:08,491 --> 02:50:09,390
early last time.

6748
02:50:09,740 --> 02:50:10,021
And they're like,

6749
02:50:10,021 --> 02:50:11,010
how do you feel that black lives matter?

6750
02:50:11,011 --> 02:50:11,970
And he hadn't heard about it yet.

6751
02:50:12,310 --> 02:50:13,143
And he goes,

6752
02:50:13,270 --> 02:50:13,880
what?

6753
02:50:13,880 --> 02:50:14,940
And he was super progressive.

6754
02:50:14,941 --> 02:50:15,151
It's like,

6755
02:50:15,151 --> 02:50:16,470
of course black lives matter.

6756
02:50:16,471 --> 02:50:17,120
All lives matter.

6757
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:17,480
We tie.

6758
02:50:17,480 --> 02:50:18,130
Yeah.

6759
02:50:18,130 --> 02:50:20,680
And like you can't see the logo for that.

6760
02:50:20,690 --> 02:50:22,080
That's a slogan for the other side.

6761
02:50:22,081 --> 02:50:22,561
And they were like,

6762
02:50:22,561 --> 02:50:23,460
wrote him off and he's like,

6763
02:50:23,490 --> 02:50:24,060
yeah,

6764
02:50:24,060 --> 02:50:24,240
no,

6765
02:50:24,240 --> 02:50:25,650
a bunch of fucking three words.

6766
02:50:25,651 --> 02:50:27,060
Summation of the whole argument.

6767
02:50:27,550 --> 02:50:27,960
Yeah.

6768
02:50:27,960 --> 02:50:29,850
Black lives matter or all lives matter.

6769
02:50:29,880 --> 02:50:30,840
And Bernie Sanders said,

6770
02:50:30,841 --> 02:50:31,710
black lives matter.

6771
02:50:31,710 --> 02:50:32,191
And he said,

6772
02:50:32,191 --> 02:50:33,024
why?

6773
02:50:33,030 --> 02:50:33,631
And people like,

6774
02:50:33,631 --> 02:50:33,781
Oh,

6775
02:50:33,781 --> 02:50:34,680
you're stupid progressive.

6776
02:50:34,681 --> 02:50:35,131
We love you,

6777
02:50:35,131 --> 02:50:35,521
Bernie.

6778
02:50:35,521 --> 02:50:38,070
You're playing by the rules that we've
established and you saying the things

6779
02:50:38,071 --> 02:50:38,461
that we make,

6780
02:50:38,461 --> 02:50:38,910
you say,

6781
02:50:38,910 --> 02:50:39,600
yeah,

6782
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:41,550
well of course all lives matter.

6783
02:50:41,580 --> 02:50:43,230
But black lives matter as well.

6784
02:50:43,231 --> 02:50:44,940
So the yellow lives matter also.

6785
02:50:44,941 --> 02:50:45,390
It's too,

6786
02:50:45,390 --> 02:50:46,670
it's too crazy too.

6787
02:50:46,940 --> 02:50:48,270
It didn't work as a slogan.

6788
02:50:48,300 --> 02:50:49,133
If you go,

6789
02:50:49,500 --> 02:50:49,681
hey,

6790
02:50:49,681 --> 02:50:52,560
we need to figure out why black people
are getting shot at a higher rate and

6791
02:50:52,561 --> 02:50:53,460
their percentages,

6792
02:50:53,510 --> 02:50:53,910
um,

6793
02:50:53,910 --> 02:50:55,290
then white people by cops.

6794
02:50:55,291 --> 02:50:57,150
So we need to like curb that immediately.

6795
02:50:57,151 --> 02:51:00,330
And we didn't make it somewhere where
you can actually trust the police to

6796
02:51:00,331 --> 02:51:02,580
represent you all and
not have a fear of them.

6797
02:51:02,730 --> 02:51:03,150
It's like,

6798
02:51:03,150 --> 02:51:04,290
that's not a slogan you can throw out.

6799
02:51:04,320 --> 02:51:04,860
Right.

6800
02:51:04,860 --> 02:51:05,910
But if you said that,

6801
02:51:05,911 --> 02:51:06,744
then nobody's gonna like,

6802
02:51:06,810 --> 02:51:07,180
no,

6803
02:51:07,180 --> 02:51:08,360
you should have to worry about cups.

6804
02:51:09,240 --> 02:51:10,250
It's like we were just like,

6805
02:51:10,400 --> 02:51:15,210
get behind that super deep and complex
conversation about systemic racism in

6806
02:51:15,211 --> 02:51:17,460
communities where like in Baltimore,

6807
02:51:17,461 --> 02:51:20,700
where they literally established zones
where black people couldn't buy homes.

6808
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:22,650
And now you're gonna
sum up the three words.

6809
02:51:23,340 --> 02:51:28,340
You've got giant cultural issues that
should be addressed on literally a

6810
02:51:29,310 --> 02:51:30,870
nationwide scale.

6811
02:51:31,170 --> 02:51:31,591
Like we're,

6812
02:51:31,591 --> 02:51:36,591
we're interested in building nations and
helping people in Afghanistan and the

6813
02:51:36,750 --> 02:51:38,820
giving aid to Saudi Arabia
and all these different,

6814
02:51:39,060 --> 02:51:39,780
uh,

6815
02:51:39,780 --> 02:51:41,370
fill in the blank with
whatever country it is.

6816
02:51:41,820 --> 02:51:44,340
How the fuck are they not fixing
the south side of Chicago?

6817
02:51:44,420 --> 02:51:44,790
Yeah.

6818
02:51:44,790 --> 02:51:45,120
I mean,

6819
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:46,770
how the fuck are they
not fixing Baltimore?

6820
02:51:46,771 --> 02:51:48,300
How do they not going to Compton,

6821
02:51:48,310 --> 02:51:49,320
Flint water,

6822
02:51:49,360 --> 02:51:50,110
still many drinkable,

6823
02:51:50,110 --> 02:51:50,790
goddammit.

6824
02:51:50,790 --> 02:51:54,030
Elon Musk has to step in and say
he's going to fix your water.

6825
02:51:54,090 --> 02:51:54,451
By the way,

6826
02:51:54,451 --> 02:51:55,284
you and I,

6827
02:51:56,510 --> 02:51:59,880
we have no idea about the
backstory to it and how to fix it.

6828
02:51:59,881 --> 02:52:01,530
We ever know pennies in
our opinions are worthless.

6829
02:52:01,531 --> 02:52:02,400
They're just worthless.

6830
02:52:02,880 --> 02:52:03,870
No solutions,

6831
02:52:04,020 --> 02:52:04,590
neither.

6832
02:52:04,590 --> 02:52:06,100
Neither one us have any

6833
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:07,060
skin in the game.

6834
02:52:07,180 --> 02:52:08,350
We're talking out of our ass,

6835
02:52:08,500 --> 02:52:08,980
but,

6836
02:52:08,980 --> 02:52:11,740
but we're going to do anything really
wrong to people without hurting anybody.

6837
02:52:11,741 --> 02:52:13,720
But if we look want to
look at things objectively,

6838
02:52:13,721 --> 02:52:15,730
that is a real valid

6839
02:52:17,230 --> 02:52:18,063
argument.

6840
02:52:18,110 --> 02:52:19,870
Real valid point of discussion.

6841
02:52:20,110 --> 02:52:20,440
It's like,

6842
02:52:20,440 --> 02:52:20,771
sure,

6843
02:52:20,771 --> 02:52:21,610
black lives matter,

6844
02:52:21,730 --> 02:52:24,460
but you know what else matters really bad.

6845
02:52:24,461 --> 02:52:28,930
Communities that have been bad for decade
after decade after decade and they're

6846
02:52:28,931 --> 02:52:30,760
not being addressed by any politicians.

6847
02:52:30,910 --> 02:52:32,710
They're not being addressed
by any community leaders.

6848
02:52:32,890 --> 02:52:34,240
No one is stepping in and saying,

6849
02:52:34,241 --> 02:52:34,750
hey,

6850
02:52:34,750 --> 02:52:37,870
before we do anything
involving any other country,

6851
02:52:37,960 --> 02:52:41,410
we've got to fix all the
problems we have right here.

6852
02:52:41,411 --> 02:52:42,700
And they can be fixed.

6853
02:52:42,850 --> 02:52:43,720
They can be fixed.

6854
02:52:43,810 --> 02:52:45,010
And it might take decades.

6855
02:52:45,100 --> 02:52:46,030
It might take years.

6856
02:52:46,031 --> 02:52:47,140
I don't know how long it's going to take,

6857
02:52:47,290 --> 02:52:50,440
but it's not going to be
fixed at all if we do nothing.

6858
02:52:51,230 --> 02:52:51,740
If we,

6859
02:52:51,740 --> 02:52:52,380
we've we've,

6860
02:52:52,380 --> 02:52:54,180
that's also part of this
argument that goes too far.

6861
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:55,240
The pendulum was here.

6862
02:52:55,290 --> 02:52:56,410
We want it back in the middle.

6863
02:52:56,530 --> 02:52:59,950
It's just going to have to swing a little
too far and then come back when we're

6864
02:52:59,980 --> 02:53:04,420
talking about me too and and sexual
harassment and rape and all this stuff.

6865
02:53:04,421 --> 02:53:06,910
I think one of the things that
we're dealing with is information.

6866
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:11,380
Does distribution of information is
occurring at a rate that's unprecedented.

6867
02:53:11,410 --> 02:53:16,410
It's never been like this before and I
think there's a real step that's going to

6868
02:53:16,601 --> 02:53:19,540
happen with human beings where you're not,

6869
02:53:19,780 --> 02:53:24,780
you're going to be able to literally
read minds and this is going to happen

6870
02:53:25,841 --> 02:53:28,930
through some sort of a merging
with humans and technology.

6871
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:31,680
Elon Musk believes it's going
to be this thing that he's,

6872
02:53:31,720 --> 02:53:35,530
he's releasing something in the next few
months called neuro link and this neuro

6873
02:53:35,531 --> 02:53:40,531
link is going to somehow or another
increase the bandwidth between people and

6874
02:53:40,751 --> 02:53:41,584
information.

6875
02:53:41,590 --> 02:53:44,590
At a rate that's going to literally
change what a human being is.

6876
02:53:45,370 --> 02:53:48,340
And the way he was
explaining it was very vague.

6877
02:53:48,490 --> 02:53:49,151
But you know,

6878
02:53:49,151 --> 02:53:53,350
when you're talking about a guy like Elon
Musk and the insane ideas that he has

6879
02:53:53,351 --> 02:53:55,360
bounced around inside
it's fucking robot brain.

6880
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:56,673
I believe him,

6881
02:53:56,770 --> 02:53:58,240
and I believe this is one step,

6882
02:53:58,241 --> 02:54:03,241
just like no one could have ever
predicted the Internet in 1960 no one ever

6883
02:54:04,601 --> 02:54:07,240
would have thought other
than I think Malcolm Mcluhan,

6884
02:54:07,900 --> 02:54:08,330
uh,

6885
02:54:08,330 --> 02:54:10,240
had some people had some,

6886
02:54:11,290 --> 02:54:12,123
yeah,

6887
02:54:12,250 --> 02:54:12,861
some people that,

6888
02:54:12,861 --> 02:54:13,750
some ideas of,

6889
02:54:13,751 --> 02:54:14,560
of what,

6890
02:54:14,560 --> 02:54:15,820
what could possibly happen.

6891
02:54:15,821 --> 02:54:16,654
But

6892
02:54:17,650 --> 02:54:18,483
no one,

6893
02:54:18,850 --> 02:54:20,980
no average person saw this comment.

6894
02:54:20,981 --> 02:54:25,981
And I think no average person is going
to see these next stages of integration

6895
02:54:26,111 --> 02:54:27,970
between human beings and technology.

6896
02:54:27,971 --> 02:54:32,971
And one of them is going to be
some sort of a translation device,

6897
02:54:33,550 --> 02:54:37,180
some sort of a translation device
that translates not just languages but

6898
02:54:37,181 --> 02:54:40,930
thoughts and a universal language that is,

6899
02:54:41,670 --> 02:54:42,370
it's,

6900
02:54:42,370 --> 02:54:45,820
it defies economic boundaries,

6901
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:47,260
political boundaries,

6902
02:54:47,261 --> 02:54:48,340
geographic boundaries,

6903
02:54:48,341 --> 02:54:50,020
something that everyone's
going to be able to understand.

6904
02:54:50,021 --> 02:54:51,040
Like the real problem,

6905
02:54:51,041 --> 02:54:53,620
like Tower of Babel argument is that,

6906
02:54:53,740 --> 02:54:54,310
you know,

6907
02:54:54,310 --> 02:54:58,080
if someone's talking in Bangladesh
and someone's talking in Japan,

6908
02:54:58,081 --> 02:54:59,350
it's someone's talking in America,

6909
02:54:59,351 --> 02:55:01,930
there's so many different
ways of saying things.

6910
02:55:02,140 --> 02:55:04,040
It's too hard to understand the mall.

6911
02:55:04,041 --> 02:55:06,020
No one knows all the languages,

6912
02:55:06,021 --> 02:55:06,270
right.

6913
02:55:06,270 --> 02:55:07,640
Very QP nuance.

6914
02:55:08,330 --> 02:55:10,040
Somebody translated the stranger.

6915
02:55:10,070 --> 02:55:10,400
Yeah.

6916
02:55:10,400 --> 02:55:11,240
Four sentences.

6917
02:55:11,290 --> 02:55:12,123
Um,

6918
02:55:12,410 --> 02:55:13,460
and it's a French I think,

6919
02:55:13,461 --> 02:55:14,150
but it's,

6920
02:55:14,150 --> 02:55:17,450
it's mother died yesterday
or was it the day before?

6921
02:55:17,451 --> 02:55:18,284
I can't be sure.

6922
02:55:18,350 --> 02:55:21,020
And they have to have arguments
about she used mother,

6923
02:55:21,021 --> 02:55:23,360
she's mom should use Mama.

6924
02:55:23,660 --> 02:55:23,811
Like,

6925
02:55:23,811 --> 02:55:27,830
which one is the actually
meaning in French and not
just get like a sterile one,

6926
02:55:27,831 --> 02:55:28,650
but like a,

6927
02:55:28,650 --> 02:55:29,090
uh,

6928
02:55:29,090 --> 02:55:30,170
a normalized once.

6929
02:55:30,171 --> 02:55:30,501
I can't,

6930
02:55:30,501 --> 02:55:30,701
it's like,

6931
02:55:30,701 --> 02:55:31,000
it's,

6932
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:32,430
it's beyond just translation.

6933
02:55:32,431 --> 02:55:32,571
So,

6934
02:55:32,571 --> 02:55:32,751
yeah.

6935
02:55:32,751 --> 02:55:33,584
So go ahead.

6936
02:55:33,660 --> 02:55:38,660
And I think this is one of the giant
problems with whenever you're dealing with

6937
02:55:40,651 --> 02:55:41,580
nationalism,

6938
02:55:41,730 --> 02:55:43,650
whenever you're dealing
with this idea of the other,

6939
02:55:43,710 --> 02:55:46,920
that someone from another place
is different than you kids.

6940
02:55:46,960 --> 02:55:49,920
And Yemen's lives don't
matter nearly as much as,

6941
02:55:50,010 --> 02:55:50,610
um,

6942
02:55:50,610 --> 02:55:51,443
I dunno,

6943
02:55:51,530 --> 02:55:55,890
someone not getting hired for late night
TV is a perfect example because they're

6944
02:55:55,891 --> 02:55:59,310
using drones to launch missiles into a
country that we're not even supposed to

6945
02:55:59,311 --> 02:55:59,980
be at war with.

6946
02:55:59,980 --> 02:56:00,160
Okay.

6947
02:56:00,160 --> 02:56:02,520
They're going after it's not insurgence.

6948
02:56:03,080 --> 02:56:03,560
Yeah.

6949
02:56:03,560 --> 02:56:07,550
A six year old little girl
is dead times a thousand.

6950
02:56:07,640 --> 02:56:08,010
Right.

6951
02:56:08,010 --> 02:56:11,060
But if one died because like,

6952
02:56:11,260 --> 02:56:12,093
but it's nice that,

6953
02:56:12,100 --> 02:56:12,671
okay,

6954
02:56:12,671 --> 02:56:15,070
it's not happening in
Chicago or San Francisco,

6955
02:56:15,100 --> 02:56:15,660
right.

6956
02:56:15,660 --> 02:56:18,670
We're just not drones launching
into the East village.

6957
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,010
So because that's not happening,

6958
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:24,700
we don't think of it as a
concern of ours and this,

6959
02:56:24,760 --> 02:56:26,440
I think these hurdles,

6960
02:56:27,400 --> 02:56:31,840
these are informational hurdles as much
as their geographical hurdles and their

6961
02:56:31,841 --> 02:56:32,860
language hurdles.

6962
02:56:32,890 --> 02:56:34,480
And these are,

6963
02:56:34,660 --> 02:56:36,160
these are hurdles of understanding.

6964
02:56:36,400 --> 02:56:41,290
And I think as our realm of
understanding expands and we get a better

6965
02:56:41,291 --> 02:56:45,580
understanding of the idea that we really
are just human beings in different

6966
02:56:45,581 --> 02:56:48,490
places and that you are
no different than me.

6967
02:56:48,491 --> 02:56:51,610
And I'm no different from some kid who
lives in China and that we're all just

6968
02:56:51,611 --> 02:56:52,241
human beings.

6969
02:56:52,241 --> 02:56:56,200
And the what of our differences are they
pale in comparison to our similarities

6970
02:56:56,590 --> 02:57:01,590
and also the random chance that you were
born in Maryland and I was born in New

6971
02:57:03,070 --> 02:57:03,560
Jersey.

6972
02:57:03,560 --> 02:57:07,390
This randomness and this idea that you
take pride in that is so foolhardy and so

6973
02:57:07,391 --> 02:57:08,224
ridiculous.

6974
02:57:08,290 --> 02:57:11,590
And the idea that somehow or another
we're on some sort of a tribe and this is

6975
02:57:11,591 --> 02:57:15,580
something that human beings will
cling to for security and safety.

6976
02:57:15,910 --> 02:57:16,780
And we go with tribe,

6977
02:57:16,781 --> 02:57:17,650
left and tribe,

6978
02:57:17,651 --> 02:57:18,101
right?

6979
02:57:18,101 --> 02:57:22,180
And we go with tribe progressive and
tried conservative and we go with tribe,

6980
02:57:22,181 --> 02:57:23,110
American tribe,

6981
02:57:23,111 --> 02:57:24,010
Canada and tribe,

6982
02:57:24,011 --> 02:57:24,521
Mexico.

6983
02:57:24,521 --> 02:57:25,510
It's all foolishness.

6984
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:28,510
And I think as technology expands,

6985
02:57:28,511 --> 02:57:30,760
that will be more and more preposterous.

6986
02:57:30,940 --> 02:57:31,511
And you're,

6987
02:57:31,511 --> 02:57:35,920
you're starting to see this with
even the way people view religion.

6988
02:57:36,550 --> 02:57:38,800
If you look to people from
just a few decades ago,

6989
02:57:39,030 --> 02:57:39,370
um,

6990
02:57:39,370 --> 02:57:41,110
how many people in this
country thought they were,

6991
02:57:41,111 --> 02:57:41,380
uh,

6992
02:57:41,380 --> 02:57:43,060
how many identified as atheist?

6993
02:57:43,061 --> 02:57:44,740
It's quite a bit less than today.

6994
02:57:45,220 --> 02:57:49,420
Quite a bit more identify with today
because you start to understand more about

6995
02:57:49,421 --> 02:57:50,230
religion.

6996
02:57:50,230 --> 02:57:52,140
There's Google people can um,

6997
02:57:52,180 --> 02:57:53,860
and Bill Maher and Sam Harris,

6998
02:57:53,861 --> 02:57:56,080
we're actually talking about
this on a podcast recently.

6999
02:57:56,590 --> 02:57:56,861
Um,

7000
02:57:56,861 --> 02:58:00,610
cause they were talking about the 10th
anniversary of Religious Bill Maher's

7001
02:58:00,611 --> 02:58:01,230
documentary.

7002
02:58:01,230 --> 02:58:02,040
They made a really good point

7003
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:05,010
that Google came along and
when Google came along,

7004
02:58:05,130 --> 02:58:09,810
people were allowed to then research the
history of Mormonism where they never

7005
02:58:09,811 --> 02:58:10,561
really could before.

7006
02:58:10,561 --> 02:58:10,831
And they go,

7007
02:58:10,831 --> 02:58:11,160
wait,

7008
02:58:11,160 --> 02:58:13,350
he was 14 and 18,

7009
02:58:13,351 --> 02:58:17,490
20 and Joseph Smith was just a kid and
he made up a bunch of find me a 14 year

7010
02:58:17,491 --> 02:58:17,611
old.

7011
02:58:17,611 --> 02:58:18,630
It's not full of shit.

7012
02:58:18,940 --> 02:58:20,190
That's way more impressive.

7013
02:58:20,670 --> 02:58:22,900
And then Scientology and,

7014
02:58:22,901 --> 02:58:23,181
and,

7015
02:58:23,181 --> 02:58:24,030
and many of the,

7016
02:58:24,060 --> 02:58:24,780
you know,

7017
02:58:24,780 --> 02:58:26,310
many of the chapters in the Bible,

7018
02:58:26,311 --> 02:58:28,260
when people look at the difference
between the New Testament,

7019
02:58:28,261 --> 02:58:31,070
the old testament who
wrote it and why and,

7020
02:58:31,160 --> 02:58:35,710
and how many passages were removed
and edited by human beings.

7021
02:58:36,170 --> 02:58:36,710
How we,

7022
02:58:36,710 --> 02:58:38,520
you decide the work of God,

7023
02:58:38,521 --> 02:58:40,590
like what gets to be
released and what's not.

7024
02:58:41,060 --> 02:58:41,190
The,

7025
02:58:41,190 --> 02:58:42,210
all that stuff is,

7026
02:58:42,330 --> 02:58:44,250
it's kindle now.

7027
02:58:44,251 --> 02:58:44,451
It's like,

7028
02:58:44,451 --> 02:58:44,910
man,

7029
02:58:44,910 --> 02:58:49,170
it's kindling for the fire of
enlightenment and in that fire spreading.

7030
02:58:49,410 --> 02:58:53,280
And I think that it's an
informational tool and these,

7031
02:58:53,310 --> 02:58:56,160
this fire enlightenment is,

7032
02:58:56,170 --> 02:58:57,003
is,

7033
02:58:57,350 --> 02:58:59,100
it's a bad term fire enlightenment.

7034
02:58:59,100 --> 02:58:59,990
But Fred,

7035
02:59:00,060 --> 02:59:01,370
when you realize too,

7036
02:59:01,380 --> 02:59:02,580
when it really does get out,

7037
02:59:02,581 --> 02:59:03,000
we're like,

7038
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:03,601
Whoa,

7039
02:59:03,601 --> 02:59:04,620
I didn't realize,

7040
02:59:04,700 --> 02:59:05,000
right.

7041
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:05,990
Got It done.

7042
02:59:06,420 --> 02:59:08,060
And we think about how
many women you like,

7043
02:59:08,130 --> 02:59:09,870
they were talking about this a
long time ago and you're like,

7044
02:59:09,871 --> 02:59:12,210
come on man,

7045
02:59:12,330 --> 02:59:13,170
relax honey.

7046
02:59:13,210 --> 02:59:13,420
Yeah,

7047
02:59:13,420 --> 02:59:14,180
exactly like that.

7048
02:59:14,180 --> 02:59:14,551
It's okay.

7049
02:59:14,551 --> 02:59:15,031
And now you're like,

7050
02:59:15,031 --> 02:59:15,870
fuck,

7051
02:59:15,900 --> 02:59:17,370
I guess it is really bad.

7052
02:59:17,430 --> 02:59:17,611
Well,

7053
02:59:17,611 --> 02:59:18,444
the Cosby,

7054
02:59:18,630 --> 02:59:19,381
the Cosby thing,

7055
02:59:19,381 --> 02:59:21,750
I remember hearing about that
when I was at news radio.

7056
02:59:21,900 --> 02:59:22,130
Yeah.

7057
02:59:22,130 --> 02:59:22,940
It was always a thing.

7058
02:59:22,940 --> 02:59:23,773
Like,

7059
02:59:23,970 --> 02:59:24,331
I don't know,

7060
02:59:24,331 --> 02:59:28,650
maybe think about it like
in terms of perse actress.

7061
02:59:28,720 --> 02:59:29,553
Yeah,

7062
02:59:29,640 --> 02:59:31,920
that was my sister who
went through or my mom.

7063
02:59:32,100 --> 02:59:34,530
That's another reason too where
I'll try to put myself in the place.

7064
02:59:34,531 --> 02:59:35,161
I'm pretty good at.

7065
02:59:35,161 --> 02:59:35,820
Like,

7066
02:59:35,820 --> 02:59:36,870
I mean you've seen me tell stories.

7067
02:59:36,871 --> 02:59:37,704
I got worked up,

7068
02:59:37,770 --> 02:59:37,980
you know,

7069
02:59:37,980 --> 02:59:40,020
I could put myself in a
place I was or you know,

7070
02:59:40,021 --> 02:59:41,130
imagine something pretty,

7071
02:59:41,190 --> 02:59:42,023
pretty good.

7072
02:59:42,660 --> 02:59:43,560
And so it's like,

7073
02:59:43,770 --> 02:59:44,190
yeah,

7074
02:59:44,190 --> 02:59:45,001
if it was your sister,

7075
02:59:45,001 --> 02:59:45,451
your mom,

7076
02:59:45,451 --> 02:59:46,081
your girlfriend,

7077
02:59:46,081 --> 02:59:46,740
your wife,

7078
02:59:46,740 --> 02:59:47,460
daughter.

7079
02:59:47,460 --> 02:59:48,100
Going through it,

7080
02:59:48,100 --> 02:59:48,421
you'd be like,

7081
02:59:48,421 --> 02:59:49,560
I'll fucking kill that guy.

7082
02:59:49,561 --> 02:59:49,861
You know?

7083
02:59:49,861 --> 02:59:50,161
It's like,

7084
02:59:50,161 --> 02:59:50,994
you're so mad.

7085
02:59:51,720 --> 02:59:53,700
But then the same thing
when I hear about like,

7086
02:59:54,360 --> 02:59:57,990
I dunno like Louie and if my
sister is like told me that,

7087
02:59:57,991 --> 02:59:58,320
I'd be like,

7088
02:59:58,320 --> 03:00:00,350
well he did what he often funny

7089
03:00:03,110 --> 03:00:05,400
red pubes how many of them were gray?

7090
03:00:05,730 --> 03:00:06,090
Yeah,

7091
03:00:06,090 --> 03:00:06,960
like right.

7092
03:00:07,170 --> 03:00:07,291
Yeah.

7093
03:00:07,291 --> 03:00:08,640
I try to put in them as a position,

7094
03:00:08,641 --> 03:00:09,181
as best as I can.

7095
03:00:09,181 --> 03:00:10,950
I still don't have to go
through it if it's wrong,

7096
03:00:10,951 --> 03:00:13,350
but like there's levels,

7097
03:00:13,530 --> 03:00:14,101
there's level.

7098
03:00:14,101 --> 03:00:15,990
But also it's like getting
back to what it's like.

7099
03:00:16,020 --> 03:00:17,850
You really hear about little
stuff now and you're like,

7100
03:00:17,851 --> 03:00:18,780
whoa.

7101
03:00:18,810 --> 03:00:19,680
But there's also,

7102
03:00:20,010 --> 03:00:21,540
in terms of someone like Louie,

7103
03:00:21,570 --> 03:00:23,550
there's gotta be a road to redemption.

7104
03:00:23,580 --> 03:00:27,420
And this is one of the problems with
people that are so fucking angry is that

7105
03:00:27,421 --> 03:00:29,370
they don't think there's
any road to redemption.

7106
03:00:29,400 --> 03:00:32,460
They want career to be taken
away and never play again.

7107
03:00:32,640 --> 03:00:34,440
But the Michael Vick thing is different.

7108
03:00:34,640 --> 03:00:36,690
Cause Michael Vick tortured and murdered,

7109
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:38,300
he didn't murder murder,

7110
03:00:38,680 --> 03:00:38,880
murder.

7111
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:43,880
But he also went to jail at the time
that the state said you would need to do

7112
03:00:44,281 --> 03:00:45,180
this for what he did,

7113
03:00:45,181 --> 03:00:46,170
he'd served his time.

7114
03:00:46,171 --> 03:00:48,150
He lost his freedom for four years.

7115
03:00:48,151 --> 03:00:48,984
Yes.

7116
03:00:49,160 --> 03:00:49,400
Yeah,

7117
03:00:49,400 --> 03:00:52,410
so his job that he had before
has nothing to do with it,

7118
03:00:52,411 --> 03:00:54,690
but it does come down to people going,

7119
03:00:55,080 --> 03:00:55,540
I,

7120
03:00:55,540 --> 03:00:57,390
I'm not through with you suffering yet.

7121
03:00:58,110 --> 03:00:58,530
Okay.

7122
03:00:58,530 --> 03:00:59,320
Same thing with Louis.

7123
03:00:59,320 --> 03:01:00,420
Still think it's a different,

7124
03:01:00,520 --> 03:01:01,480
I'm not through with you suffered,

7125
03:01:01,510 --> 03:01:04,600
you represent killing about two
women torturing versus different.

7126
03:01:04,601 --> 03:01:05,860
Do you represent evil to women?

7127
03:01:05,861 --> 03:01:06,670
Just cause he beat off.

7128
03:01:06,670 --> 03:01:08,050
He's a representative of that.

7129
03:01:08,770 --> 03:01:11,830
Of course you're just a creeper but like
not even that I don't think but like

7130
03:01:12,580 --> 03:01:14,920
but like pervert I guess.

7131
03:01:15,400 --> 03:01:16,180
What are Ya?

7132
03:01:16,180 --> 03:01:16,840
I Dunno man.

7133
03:01:16,840 --> 03:01:20,240
Actually deviant hang out with two girls
who were like talking dirty to you for

7134
03:01:20,241 --> 03:01:22,840
two days ago on drinks with them
and you start getting like the idea,

7135
03:01:22,841 --> 03:01:23,760
it's like I think I got to hook up.

7136
03:01:23,780 --> 03:01:24,760
I think I might have a threesome.

7137
03:01:25,060 --> 03:01:27,010
And they're like that's not
enough reason to go for,

7138
03:01:27,011 --> 03:01:27,221
it's like,

7139
03:01:27,221 --> 03:01:27,341
yeah,

7140
03:01:27,341 --> 03:01:27,731
you're right.

7141
03:01:27,731 --> 03:01:28,930
Like I need more signs for like,

7142
03:01:29,290 --> 03:01:29,381
well,

7143
03:01:29,381 --> 03:01:30,640
let me say you want to go out for drinks?

7144
03:01:30,641 --> 03:01:31,241
And I do.

7145
03:01:31,241 --> 03:01:31,781
It's like still,

7146
03:01:31,781 --> 03:01:31,970
no,

7147
03:01:31,970 --> 03:01:33,170
it's not enough of a sign.

7148
03:01:33,171 --> 03:01:33,461
It's like,

7149
03:01:33,461 --> 03:01:33,641
y'all,

7150
03:01:33,641 --> 03:01:34,001
you're right,

7151
03:01:34,001 --> 03:01:34,570
you're right.

7152
03:01:34,570 --> 03:01:34,721
Oh,

7153
03:01:34,721 --> 03:01:35,650
I know all about them.

7154
03:01:35,651 --> 03:01:36,550
Up to my hotel room.

7155
03:01:36,790 --> 03:01:39,060
That's usually pretty universal
sign and they're coming there.

7156
03:01:39,061 --> 03:01:40,000
Came to my hotel room.

7157
03:01:40,150 --> 03:01:40,451
No,

7158
03:01:40,451 --> 03:01:41,081
that's not enough.

7159
03:01:41,081 --> 03:01:41,441
You're right.

7160
03:01:41,441 --> 03:01:41,771
You're right.

7161
03:01:41,771 --> 03:01:42,041
You're right.

7162
03:01:42,041 --> 03:01:43,930
All these signs is not
enough to tell you what,

7163
03:01:43,960 --> 03:01:45,190
I'll just ask outright,

7164
03:01:45,280 --> 03:01:46,630
can I fucking jerk off in front of you?

7165
03:01:46,690 --> 03:01:47,141
And they said,

7166
03:01:47,141 --> 03:01:47,974
yes.

7167
03:01:48,340 --> 03:01:48,701
No,

7168
03:01:48,701 --> 03:01:49,900
that's still not enough.

7169
03:01:50,440 --> 03:01:51,700
What are you talking about?

7170
03:01:52,750 --> 03:01:52,901
Well,

7171
03:01:52,901 --> 03:01:53,321
here's the,

7172
03:01:53,321 --> 03:01:53,771
so no,

7173
03:01:53,771 --> 03:01:54,610
not creeper,

7174
03:01:54,880 --> 03:01:56,500
but he represents things to people.

7175
03:01:56,710 --> 03:02:00,520
Just like Roseanne represented Trump when
she said she has a character of voted

7176
03:02:00,521 --> 03:02:01,900
for Trump and Nixon the show.

7177
03:02:02,290 --> 03:02:04,600
So because the representative
evil gets women,

7178
03:02:04,601 --> 03:02:05,170
they go,

7179
03:02:05,170 --> 03:02:09,670
just get rid of that representative and
they're not seeing them as a human being

7180
03:02:09,671 --> 03:02:13,270
that people actually know
that is a human as a person.

7181
03:02:13,570 --> 03:02:14,403
Not only that,

7182
03:02:14,800 --> 03:02:16,270
if someone says yes,

7183
03:02:16,900 --> 03:02:17,860
if you ask,

7184
03:02:17,861 --> 03:02:19,090
can I beat off in front of you?

7185
03:02:19,091 --> 03:02:20,820
And they say yes and then never side.

7186
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:20,961
No,

7187
03:02:20,961 --> 03:02:21,041
no,

7188
03:02:21,041 --> 03:02:21,571
I was just kidding.

7189
03:02:21,571 --> 03:02:22,260
Just kidding.

7190
03:02:22,260 --> 03:02:23,380
Does leave the yes out there.

7191
03:02:24,790 --> 03:02:25,330
We're done here.

7192
03:02:25,330 --> 03:02:25,990
We're done.

7193
03:02:25,990 --> 03:02:26,411
Did you say?

7194
03:02:26,411 --> 03:02:27,240
Yes.

7195
03:02:27,240 --> 03:02:28,930
So like if a girl says,

7196
03:02:28,931 --> 03:02:29,380
can I,

7197
03:02:29,380 --> 03:02:30,850
can I play with my pussy in front of you?

7198
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:31,361
And you go,

7199
03:02:31,361 --> 03:02:32,050
yeah.

7200
03:02:32,050 --> 03:02:32,980
And then she does he go,

7201
03:02:32,981 --> 03:02:35,620
well that was fucking disgusting
and I can't believe this happened.

7202
03:02:35,621 --> 03:02:36,880
And I'm going right to the press.

7203
03:02:37,600 --> 03:02:38,200
Like,

7204
03:02:38,200 --> 03:02:38,980
wait a minute.

7205
03:02:38,980 --> 03:02:40,060
Did you say yes?

7206
03:02:40,320 --> 03:02:41,153
Like,

7207
03:02:41,190 --> 03:02:41,650
okay,

7208
03:02:41,650 --> 03:02:43,190
here's one thing is if this is a,

7209
03:02:43,250 --> 03:02:44,380
an aggressive,

7210
03:02:44,650 --> 03:02:45,640
angry person,

7211
03:02:45,641 --> 03:02:46,391
a traps you to room,

7212
03:02:46,391 --> 03:02:46,650
you've,

7213
03:02:46,650 --> 03:02:48,220
you only way you can get out.

7214
03:02:48,250 --> 03:02:50,620
The only way you can get out of this room
as you let this guy beat off in front

7215
03:02:50,621 --> 03:02:51,400
of you and you've,

7216
03:02:51,400 --> 03:02:52,690
you fearful of your life,

7217
03:02:52,720 --> 03:02:53,411
people don't really,

7218
03:02:53,411 --> 03:02:54,520
most people don't really care.

7219
03:02:54,910 --> 03:02:57,430
I saw him on stage of
one cough like crazy.

7220
03:02:57,760 --> 03:02:58,600
They were so happy.

7221
03:02:58,601 --> 03:02:59,250
And when he goes,

7222
03:02:59,250 --> 03:03:00,520
cause I'm just going to do jokes tonight.

7223
03:03:00,550 --> 03:03:01,091
Everyone's like,

7224
03:03:01,091 --> 03:03:02,800
fuck yes.

7225
03:03:02,860 --> 03:03:03,370
Yeah,

7226
03:03:03,370 --> 03:03:04,690
just to jokes,

7227
03:03:04,750 --> 03:03:05,171
jokes.

7228
03:03:05,171 --> 03:03:08,140
We just want to see what we
loved about two years ago,

7229
03:03:09,220 --> 03:03:10,053
10 months ago.

7230
03:03:10,180 --> 03:03:10,901
And Michael Vick,

7231
03:03:10,901 --> 03:03:12,340
we just want you to see you throw,

7232
03:03:12,341 --> 03:03:13,120
we're done with that.

7233
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:14,920
You digital crime or we still hate you.

7234
03:03:15,070 --> 03:03:16,690
It has nothing to do
with Michael Richards.

7235
03:03:16,750 --> 03:03:17,830
How you got your job?

7236
03:03:18,460 --> 03:03:18,761
He didn't,

7237
03:03:18,761 --> 03:03:19,250
he just,

7238
03:03:19,250 --> 03:03:19,610
he just,

7239
03:03:19,610 --> 03:03:20,770
he yelled out racist shit.

7240
03:03:21,430 --> 03:03:21,731
But like,

7241
03:03:21,731 --> 03:03:22,480
but like nobody,

7242
03:03:22,480 --> 03:03:23,260
nobody saw it.

7243
03:03:23,260 --> 03:03:24,580
Nobody liked him on stage.

7244
03:03:24,610 --> 03:03:25,001
But the thing,

7245
03:03:25,001 --> 03:03:25,241
yeah,

7246
03:03:25,241 --> 03:03:25,600
you're right.

7247
03:03:25,600 --> 03:03:26,890
So it's like I'm not missing anything.

7248
03:03:27,270 --> 03:03:28,420
Lily is,

7249
03:03:28,600 --> 03:03:29,433
you know,

7250
03:03:29,740 --> 03:03:30,040
you,

7251
03:03:30,040 --> 03:03:33,460
there's gotta be some path
of redemption for everybody.

7252
03:03:33,640 --> 03:03:33,821
Yeah.

7253
03:03:33,821 --> 03:03:34,391
For everybody.

7254
03:03:34,391 --> 03:03:35,770
I mean human beings.

7255
03:03:35,800 --> 03:03:36,850
Very wild.

7256
03:03:36,970 --> 03:03:37,900
Bill Cosby.

7257
03:03:38,050 --> 03:03:38,380
No,

7258
03:03:38,380 --> 03:03:41,920
not go up at a prison talent show.

7259
03:03:42,760 --> 03:03:43,420
No,

7260
03:03:43,420 --> 03:03:43,870
no,

7261
03:03:43,870 --> 03:03:44,590
no.

7262
03:03:44,590 --> 03:03:45,260
It's over.

7263
03:03:45,260 --> 03:03:48,160
He can't even go up in prison.

7264
03:03:48,280 --> 03:03:49,113
No.

7265
03:03:49,300 --> 03:03:50,133
Disagree.

7266
03:03:50,170 --> 03:03:51,003
No,

7267
03:03:51,070 --> 03:03:51,720
I'm kidding.

7268
03:03:51,720 --> 03:03:55,990
I took until you show me the connection
to what he did versus this job.

7269
03:03:56,230 --> 03:03:56,800
You know what I mean?

7270
03:03:56,800 --> 03:03:58,460
If you Pete rose bed on baseball,

7271
03:03:58,940 --> 03:04:01,820
he hurt the job he was
doing so that you got like,

7272
03:04:01,821 --> 03:04:04,550
you can't be in baseball anymore
cause you fucked over baseball.

7273
03:04:05,570 --> 03:04:07,580
But did he fuck over
baseball by betting on it?

7274
03:04:08,240 --> 03:04:08,601
Yeah.

7275
03:04:08,601 --> 03:04:08,760
He,

7276
03:04:08,760 --> 03:04:13,160
they show he liked probably through some
games or he like use his relievers in

7277
03:04:13,161 --> 03:04:13,590
situations.

7278
03:04:13,590 --> 03:04:14,391
He wouldn't have that.

7279
03:04:14,391 --> 03:04:17,310
He can't use them tomorrow because
you fucked over baseball that fuck.

7280
03:04:17,390 --> 03:04:22,310
So you basically shut its doors
to you if you steal jokes.

7281
03:04:22,580 --> 03:04:23,350
Yes.

7282
03:04:23,350 --> 03:04:26,150
You maybe there is a
path to redemption maybe,

7283
03:04:26,210 --> 03:04:27,620
but you fucked over jokes.

7284
03:04:27,890 --> 03:04:31,130
Well you fucked over other comments
so you fucked over the experience.

7285
03:04:31,131 --> 03:04:32,360
You're talking about getting back into it.

7286
03:04:32,390 --> 03:04:34,700
But that guy can go to the supermarket.

7287
03:04:34,850 --> 03:04:35,360
Yes,

7288
03:04:35,360 --> 03:04:37,970
he can work at another job
because that has nothing.

7289
03:04:37,980 --> 03:04:40,310
You haven't shown me a
connection to another job.

7290
03:04:40,550 --> 03:04:43,040
See the thing about the
jokes dealing thing,

7291
03:04:43,100 --> 03:04:44,540
and this is where it gets really,

7292
03:04:44,600 --> 03:04:45,440
really weird,

7293
03:04:45,740 --> 03:04:50,740
is there's no real punishment other
than people deciding they don't like you

7294
03:04:50,991 --> 03:04:53,510
because you're a joke thief and
that is the real punishment.

7295
03:04:53,570 --> 03:04:54,830
Like you're talking like
a Twitter take you down.

7296
03:04:54,831 --> 03:04:55,041
It's like,

7297
03:04:55,041 --> 03:04:55,191
no,

7298
03:04:55,191 --> 03:04:55,281
no,

7299
03:04:55,281 --> 03:04:55,401
no.

7300
03:04:55,401 --> 03:04:57,740
What I'm saying is it's different
than someone who steals cars,

7301
03:04:57,770 --> 03:04:58,220
right?

7302
03:04:58,220 --> 03:04:59,250
Someone steals cars.

7303
03:04:59,251 --> 03:04:59,990
The punishment setup.

7304
03:04:59,990 --> 03:05:00,171
Yeah,

7305
03:05:00,171 --> 03:05:00,801
you go to jail.

7306
03:05:00,801 --> 03:05:01,380
It's illegal.

7307
03:05:01,380 --> 03:05:04,520
If someone steals jokes like you
basically done the same thing,

7308
03:05:04,550 --> 03:05:07,590
you've stolen a thing and
you know that thing is a,

7309
03:05:07,910 --> 03:05:08,743
the thing is,

7310
03:05:08,780 --> 03:05:09,080
yeah,

7311
03:05:09,080 --> 03:05:12,050
you also a little different because
you can still do your jokes.

7312
03:05:12,620 --> 03:05:13,041
If I stay there,

7313
03:05:13,041 --> 03:05:13,371
a car,

7314
03:05:13,371 --> 03:05:14,710
you can't have her caught on the one on.

7315
03:05:14,730 --> 03:05:18,170
If somebody goes on in front of you
like we know him and see it did and does

7316
03:05:18,171 --> 03:05:18,860
your headline.

7317
03:05:18,860 --> 03:05:21,470
Europe is closing bit on purpose,

7318
03:05:21,471 --> 03:05:23,090
on purpose to fuck with you.

7319
03:05:23,360 --> 03:05:25,310
He would do closing bits.

7320
03:05:25,400 --> 03:05:29,030
That was Freddie fucking with
Bobby once and he was like,

7321
03:05:29,090 --> 03:05:29,271
Oh,

7322
03:05:29,271 --> 03:05:29,900
you're going to love it.

7323
03:05:29,900 --> 03:05:31,760
I mean he would fuck with Bobby populate,

7324
03:05:32,210 --> 03:05:33,043
but it wasn't.

7325
03:05:33,060 --> 03:05:33,770
Yeah,

7326
03:05:33,770 --> 03:05:34,800
it was to fuck with Bobby.

7327
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:35,590
He said,

7328
03:05:35,590 --> 03:05:36,800
you've got to love this nice guy.

7329
03:05:36,801 --> 03:05:38,180
He's so funny and Bobby,

7330
03:05:38,181 --> 03:05:39,710
all the wanted was Freddy support.

7331
03:05:40,010 --> 03:05:42,530
He looked up to him so hard
and he could never get it.

7332
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:44,120
You're going to love this next guy.

7333
03:05:44,121 --> 03:05:46,580
Does this joke about selling corn on
the side of the road and he's like,

7334
03:05:46,581 --> 03:05:49,460
y'all and Coney corn corner yells so good.

7335
03:05:49,461 --> 03:05:51,050
He has this other bit about,

7336
03:05:51,230 --> 03:05:52,730
about his Dallas bits.

7337
03:05:52,790 --> 03:05:53,623
He would just tell the,

7338
03:05:53,730 --> 03:05:58,160
the ending punchlines that this bit
to pull his legs out from under him.

7339
03:05:58,560 --> 03:05:59,393
That's a terrible thing.

7340
03:05:59,920 --> 03:06:00,830
He was fucking with him,

7341
03:06:00,980 --> 03:06:02,810
but he wasn't doing to gain himself.

7342
03:06:02,840 --> 03:06:05,560
Only to hurt Bobby and only
in one moment that I ever saw,

7343
03:06:05,580 --> 03:06:06,413
but it was like,

7344
03:06:06,530 --> 03:06:08,960
fuck you got me bad.

7345
03:06:10,850 --> 03:06:11,683
Yeah.

7346
03:06:11,990 --> 03:06:13,250
I mean they were bitter enemies.

7347
03:06:13,280 --> 03:06:15,830
It was like something about routing,

7348
03:06:16,970 --> 03:06:21,310
routing them out to somebody a
long time before those arguments.

7349
03:06:21,330 --> 03:06:22,010
Waco,

7350
03:06:22,010 --> 03:06:22,550
it's done.

7351
03:06:22,550 --> 03:06:24,920
But like they hated each other back then.

7352
03:06:25,730 --> 03:06:26,810
Freddie hated Bobby.

7353
03:06:26,811 --> 03:06:27,360
Bobby.

7354
03:06:27,360 --> 03:06:30,890
They hated them back only because the
thing about people getting caught,

7355
03:06:31,010 --> 03:06:33,500
it's like the punishments real though.

7356
03:06:33,620 --> 03:06:36,320
It's almost better than
going to jail like we don't.

7357
03:06:36,520 --> 03:06:37,610
We know about you now.

7358
03:06:37,640 --> 03:06:39,230
Not only do we know about you now,

7359
03:06:39,231 --> 03:06:43,250
but the public knows about you
now and the disdain is palpable.

7360
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:44,241
It's real.

7361
03:06:44,241 --> 03:06:45,740
And you see it not just with him,

7362
03:06:45,741 --> 03:06:46,270
not just hope.

7363
03:06:46,270 --> 03:06:46,701
You can see it,

7364
03:06:46,701 --> 03:06:47,990
but here's a few of them.

7365
03:06:48,080 --> 03:06:50,720
And you can tell a difference
too between somebody going back,

7366
03:06:50,721 --> 03:06:54,440
I took that guys joke
versus that guy takes jokes.

7367
03:06:55,050 --> 03:06:55,500
Know what I mean?

7368
03:06:55,500 --> 03:06:55,861
The back.

7369
03:06:55,861 --> 03:06:56,070
I took

7370
03:06:56,070 --> 03:06:57,570
that guy that's out there and that's real.

7371
03:06:57,600 --> 03:06:58,020
Right.

7372
03:06:58,020 --> 03:07:02,520
But it doesn't quite stick as much as
like we all just know that guy steals

7373
03:07:02,521 --> 03:07:02,911
jokes.

7374
03:07:02,911 --> 03:07:03,530
Right.

7375
03:07:03,530 --> 03:07:04,363
You know,

7376
03:07:04,560 --> 03:07:06,180
not a possible parallel.

7377
03:07:06,181 --> 03:07:07,500
It's like over and over again,

7378
03:07:07,501 --> 03:07:10,560
like such a clarity to in the
difference between the jokes,

7379
03:07:10,561 --> 03:07:13,290
they come up with it on their own
and the jokes that they steal.

7380
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:14,520
You can keep going up.

7381
03:07:14,521 --> 03:07:15,780
You can still settle theaters.

7382
03:07:15,990 --> 03:07:17,160
So your punishment is,

7383
03:07:17,370 --> 03:07:18,510
we know about you.

7384
03:07:18,990 --> 03:07:19,391
I can't,

7385
03:07:19,391 --> 03:07:20,760
you can't saw theater style.

7386
03:07:20,790 --> 03:07:22,590
That's what happens to them eventually.

7387
03:07:22,591 --> 03:07:24,870
But a lot of them still do the name one.

7388
03:07:25,490 --> 03:07:27,330
Dan Cook continue to
sell it theater as well.

7389
03:07:27,331 --> 03:07:27,971
He's does it.

7390
03:07:27,971 --> 03:07:31,260
So things dog died off eventually,

7391
03:07:31,261 --> 03:07:32,690
but a lot of people die off too.

7392
03:07:33,090 --> 03:07:34,590
But during while it was happening,

7393
03:07:34,620 --> 03:07:35,520
there was no real,

7394
03:07:35,521 --> 03:07:36,690
he was still doing massive numbers.

7395
03:07:36,691 --> 03:07:40,260
Meant CEO's still doing living
better than most a level comics.

7396
03:07:40,650 --> 03:07:41,490
Even after all that,

7397
03:07:41,491 --> 03:07:44,730
you mean even right now actually
he's still makes more money than,

7398
03:07:44,760 --> 03:07:46,140
than Mike [inaudible] does.

7399
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:47,401
You know,

7400
03:07:47,401 --> 03:07:49,410
then really good comments in big j does,

7401
03:07:49,920 --> 03:07:50,610
you know,

7402
03:07:50,610 --> 03:07:52,470
he probably still makes more
money than I do it to be honest.

7403
03:07:53,070 --> 03:07:53,791
You know what I'm doing.

7404
03:07:53,791 --> 03:07:55,050
It's greatest I've ever done,

7405
03:07:55,080 --> 03:07:57,930
but like so it's like it doesn't
get taken away from you completely.

7406
03:07:58,520 --> 03:08:00,210
You'll never get the
respect of your peers.

7407
03:08:00,420 --> 03:08:01,890
That's a big deal with us.

7408
03:08:02,770 --> 03:08:04,980
That's what we're talking about.

7409
03:08:04,981 --> 03:08:06,740
This in the back of the comedy store,

7410
03:08:06,770 --> 03:08:07,900
when he was talking about a bunch of shit,

7411
03:08:07,901 --> 03:08:11,540
he was calling through and
splitting up and all this and that.

7412
03:08:11,570 --> 03:08:11,791
He goes,

7413
03:08:11,791 --> 03:08:12,211
listen,

7414
03:08:12,211 --> 03:08:13,080
at the end of the day,

7415
03:08:13,081 --> 03:08:14,700
all I give a fuck about,

7416
03:08:14,820 --> 03:08:17,610
do I have the love and
respect of my peers?

7417
03:08:17,840 --> 03:08:18,020
Yeah.

7418
03:08:18,020 --> 03:08:20,920
And those guys don't have it and it
fucking drives them crazy and kind of

7419
03:08:21,600 --> 03:08:22,050
punishment.

7420
03:08:22,050 --> 03:08:23,370
You can take jokes and do whatever,

7421
03:08:23,371 --> 03:08:24,204
but like

7422
03:08:25,560 --> 03:08:27,690
we're never going to look up to
you and that's what you want.

7423
03:08:28,320 --> 03:08:29,153
Yeah.

7424
03:08:29,490 --> 03:08:29,851
And on that,

7425
03:08:29,851 --> 03:08:30,750
nobody hates Larry.

7426
03:08:32,100 --> 03:08:32,970
Nobody hates Larry.

7427
03:08:33,090 --> 03:08:33,541
They might,

7428
03:08:33,541 --> 03:08:35,160
they might think he's like lame,

7429
03:08:35,161 --> 03:08:36,180
but nobody hates him.

7430
03:08:36,240 --> 03:08:36,931
Larry the cable guy.

7431
03:08:36,931 --> 03:08:37,140
Yeah,

7432
03:08:37,140 --> 03:08:37,800
he's a great guy.

7433
03:08:37,800 --> 03:08:38,610
Great Guy.

7434
03:08:38,610 --> 03:08:42,220
I want one more story
before I go about this.

7435
03:08:42,221 --> 03:08:43,500
Had really an MMA podcast.

7436
03:08:43,501 --> 03:08:44,334
It's kind of not,

7437
03:08:44,370 --> 03:08:46,590
but it is release it over.

7438
03:08:46,600 --> 03:08:48,930
He was always like that though.

7439
03:08:50,610 --> 03:08:51,480
I did this thing,

7440
03:08:51,600 --> 03:08:56,280
you helped me like organize a little bit
or or arrange it in my head where I was

7441
03:08:56,580 --> 03:09:01,580
really stoked on the experience La people
have with medical marijuana and I said

7442
03:09:02,880 --> 03:09:05,490
it's not fair that other people don't
get to have this experience of taking

7443
03:09:05,491 --> 03:09:07,710
these breast trips at a UFC.

7444
03:09:07,740 --> 03:09:08,670
How great it is.

7445
03:09:08,730 --> 03:09:09,570
And I was like,

7446
03:09:10,110 --> 03:09:12,630
I'm going to have an event
called hunt for the edible.

7447
03:09:12,660 --> 03:09:13,493
Oh No.

7448
03:09:13,890 --> 03:09:15,900
And I am going to hide marijuana,

7449
03:09:15,901 --> 03:09:17,100
have a scavenger hunt.

7450
03:09:17,220 --> 03:09:19,410
At first I thought like have some
clues and they'll come to me.

7451
03:09:19,411 --> 03:09:19,990
I'll give it to them.

7452
03:09:19,990 --> 03:09:21,600
Like a cop will do that and come to you.

7453
03:09:21,610 --> 03:09:22,381
You're like the point.

7454
03:09:22,381 --> 03:09:22,711
Good point.

7455
03:09:22,711 --> 03:09:23,544
I gotta hide this.

7456
03:09:25,650 --> 03:09:28,350
So I would hide drugs.

7457
03:09:28,380 --> 03:09:30,450
I mean drugs but only marijuana.

7458
03:09:30,870 --> 03:09:31,710
A onetime mushrooms.

7459
03:09:31,711 --> 03:09:32,350
But like a,

7460
03:09:32,350 --> 03:09:36,540
at UFC I would have
access to it beforehand.

7461
03:09:36,541 --> 03:09:37,650
When we went to the MGM,

7462
03:09:37,710 --> 03:09:38,550
if for the weigh ins,

7463
03:09:38,551 --> 03:09:39,660
half of it was shut down.

7464
03:09:39,661 --> 03:09:42,960
So the other half I could just walk
through freely and I would hide.

7465
03:09:42,961 --> 03:09:46,260
I would tape these breaths
trips to somewhere.

7466
03:09:46,290 --> 03:09:48,120
The first one's underneath the bathroom,

7467
03:09:48,121 --> 03:09:52,890
sink in a fucking in one of the
bathrooms and draw clues on Twitter.

7468
03:09:52,900 --> 03:09:54,220
Released them every five minutes,

7469
03:09:54,220 --> 03:09:55,180
plan it out ahead of time.

7470
03:09:55,330 --> 03:09:56,080
But one was like,

7471
03:09:56,080 --> 03:09:56,850
if you want to get high,

7472
03:09:56,850 --> 03:09:57,611
go up a level.

7473
03:09:57,611 --> 03:09:57,940
And it's like,

7474
03:09:57,940 --> 03:09:58,151
okay.

7475
03:09:58,151 --> 03:09:58,661
People were like,

7476
03:09:58,661 --> 03:09:59,494
run up.

7477
03:09:59,500 --> 03:10:00,580
People got into it,

7478
03:10:00,910 --> 03:10:02,480
they run up levels and then they,

7479
03:10:02,560 --> 03:10:03,281
until this guy was like,

7480
03:10:03,281 --> 03:10:04,180
I think it's right here,

7481
03:10:04,210 --> 03:10:04,881
this bathroom sink.

7482
03:10:04,881 --> 03:10:06,820
Then he looked under it on did it,

7483
03:10:07,450 --> 03:10:09,130
had a note in there
with the proper dosage,

7484
03:10:10,250 --> 03:10:10,980
you know,

7485
03:10:10,980 --> 03:10:11,400
I don't know.

7486
03:10:11,400 --> 03:10:12,910
I want to fuck anybody over.

7487
03:10:13,600 --> 03:10:14,320
And uh,

7488
03:10:14,320 --> 03:10:15,730
it became such a fun,

7489
03:10:15,731 --> 03:10:16,564
fun time.

7490
03:10:16,600 --> 03:10:20,080
I got to assume the powers that
be knew about it and said nothing.

7491
03:10:20,110 --> 03:10:21,220
Is it plausible that I ability,

7492
03:10:21,221 --> 03:10:21,581
I don't know.

7493
03:10:21,581 --> 03:10:22,330
I don't care.

7494
03:10:22,330 --> 03:10:23,440
Did I promote it?

7495
03:10:23,920 --> 03:10:24,753
No.

7496
03:10:24,820 --> 03:10:26,530
I tell people and I don't think so.

7497
03:10:26,670 --> 03:10:26,920
Yeah.

7498
03:10:26,920 --> 03:10:27,521
So how did they,

7499
03:10:27,521 --> 03:10:28,660
how do you think they knew about it?

7500
03:10:28,690 --> 03:10:29,021
Twitter,

7501
03:10:29,021 --> 03:10:31,540
I might've mentioned it on
the podcast or something,

7502
03:10:31,600 --> 03:10:32,433
but um,

7503
03:10:32,470 --> 03:10:34,030
it was so fun for me.

7504
03:10:34,690 --> 03:10:35,290
Um,

7505
03:10:35,290 --> 03:10:37,540
and I would do it over and over
again and then I would go back.

7506
03:10:37,541 --> 03:10:39,040
I remember looking times where I would go,

7507
03:10:39,220 --> 03:10:40,090
I would tape it to like a,

7508
03:10:40,091 --> 03:10:41,350
a pillar somewhere.

7509
03:10:41,351 --> 03:10:44,130
I like the Pearl and I would go to
see if it's found under his feet.

7510
03:10:44,290 --> 03:10:46,810
Usher go like as I was looking at,

7511
03:10:46,811 --> 03:10:47,231
he didn't know.

7512
03:10:47,231 --> 03:10:48,280
I was wondering who hit it,

7513
03:10:48,281 --> 03:10:48,790
you know,

7514
03:10:48,790 --> 03:10:48,971
he,

7515
03:10:48,971 --> 03:10:49,720
he would just go,

7516
03:10:49,720 --> 03:10:53,830
what's you're looking for is no longer
here because I guess a bunch of people

7517
03:10:53,831 --> 03:10:55,990
kept coming to this pillar and
they would follow the clues.

7518
03:10:55,991 --> 03:10:57,520
No one said it.

7519
03:10:57,530 --> 03:11:00,490
Someone once said it's found
now cut the game later.

7520
03:11:00,491 --> 03:11:01,870
I would go in and delete all the clues.

7521
03:11:01,871 --> 03:11:04,060
I'm not looking to fuck over
the cops or anything like that,

7522
03:11:04,570 --> 03:11:07,210
but it was so fun.

7523
03:11:07,360 --> 03:11:09,160
One time nobody found one.

7524
03:11:09,250 --> 03:11:10,480
I was always living like still here.

7525
03:11:10,480 --> 03:11:12,730
I'm fucking taken it off using it myself.

7526
03:11:13,570 --> 03:11:17,250
But it usually had high two of them
underneath the fucking fire extinguisher,

7527
03:11:17,440 --> 03:11:18,273
something like that.

7528
03:11:18,670 --> 03:11:19,630
Now one time,

7529
03:11:20,150 --> 03:11:20,983
um,

7530
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:26,710
somebody found it and then came down
and sat like right behind me and Shandra

7531
03:11:27,490 --> 03:11:27,971
and then,

7532
03:11:27,971 --> 03:11:28,780
um,

7533
03:11:28,780 --> 03:11:29,141
these,

7534
03:11:29,141 --> 03:11:32,650
these usher slash security guards
came and found the guy and said,

7535
03:11:32,680 --> 03:11:33,100
hey,

7536
03:11:33,100 --> 03:11:34,120
I need you to come with me.

7537
03:11:34,630 --> 03:11:35,950
And they took them out and I was like,

7538
03:11:35,951 --> 03:11:36,760
fuck.

7539
03:11:36,760 --> 03:11:37,331
He kept his mouth.

7540
03:11:37,331 --> 03:11:37,691
He wasn't like,

7541
03:11:37,691 --> 03:11:38,590
it was just getting in front of me.

7542
03:11:38,591 --> 03:11:41,680
And I sat there for about
30 seconds and I was like,

7543
03:11:42,400 --> 03:11:43,180
I got to go Shandra.

7544
03:11:43,180 --> 03:11:44,013
I gotta go fucking,

7545
03:11:45,050 --> 03:11:46,540
I got to turn myself in on this.

7546
03:11:47,250 --> 03:11:48,760
Oh yeah.

7547
03:11:49,210 --> 03:11:49,781
And she was like,

7548
03:11:49,781 --> 03:11:50,171
what am I,

7549
03:11:50,171 --> 03:11:50,371
I'm,

7550
03:11:50,371 --> 03:11:51,550
I'm I letting this fucking kid,

7551
03:11:51,551 --> 03:11:51,820
dude,

7552
03:11:51,820 --> 03:11:52,390
fuck.

7553
03:11:52,390 --> 03:11:53,410
I gotta say like,

7554
03:11:53,411 --> 03:11:53,561
no,

7555
03:11:53,561 --> 03:11:54,070
I hit it.

7556
03:11:54,070 --> 03:11:54,940
I'll figure it out.

7557
03:11:55,840 --> 03:11:56,920
And then I went up there
and they were like,

7558
03:11:56,950 --> 03:11:57,100
oh no.

7559
03:11:57,100 --> 03:12:00,100
They were just moving our seats
because we were sitting around,

7560
03:12:00,200 --> 03:12:01,033
suits were fine.

7561
03:12:03,110 --> 03:12:03,431
I was like,

7562
03:12:03,431 --> 03:12:03,551
oh,

7563
03:12:03,551 --> 03:12:03,881
that guy.

7564
03:12:03,881 --> 03:12:04,230
Thank God.

7565
03:12:04,230 --> 03:12:07,990
Didn't you get busted in like Minneapolis
or some shit at the mall of America

7566
03:12:07,991 --> 03:12:11,790
that wasn't in the UFC at the
mall of America outside the UFC.

7567
03:12:11,800 --> 03:12:12,101
Sure.

7568
03:12:12,101 --> 03:12:12,934
People would be like,

7569
03:12:13,050 --> 03:12:13,291
oh,

7570
03:12:13,291 --> 03:12:14,120
I wish I never did much.

7571
03:12:14,120 --> 03:12:15,070
I'm mushrooms was in,

7572
03:12:15,071 --> 03:12:15,940
was in Winnipeg,

7573
03:12:15,941 --> 03:12:16,990
was not at a UFC,

7574
03:12:17,230 --> 03:12:18,370
was just that comedy shows.

7575
03:12:18,480 --> 03:12:18,880
Oh,

7576
03:12:18,880 --> 03:12:19,180
uh,

7577
03:12:19,180 --> 03:12:24,180
but the UFC experience was so fun for
me to give these people the drugs that I

7578
03:12:24,281 --> 03:12:28,970
took and I want you to experience this
heavily blown out on we'd experience at

7579
03:12:29,280 --> 03:12:30,790
me and das get to do,

7580
03:12:31,390 --> 03:12:33,190
and it was fun to spread that joy.

7581
03:12:33,520 --> 03:12:34,450
It really was fun.

7582
03:12:34,451 --> 03:12:36,730
It was one of my favorite
memories of this UFC one.

7583
03:12:36,731 --> 03:12:37,810
If you could do that again,

7584
03:12:37,811 --> 03:12:39,220
now that it's totally legal.

7585
03:12:40,030 --> 03:12:40,211
Ooh,

7586
03:12:40,211 --> 03:12:41,021
maybe you're right.

7587
03:12:41,021 --> 03:12:42,370
California and Nevada,

7588
03:12:42,400 --> 03:12:44,560
they're both legally legal,

7589
03:12:44,620 --> 03:12:45,011
legal,

7590
03:12:45,011 --> 03:12:45,844
legal,

7591
03:12:45,930 --> 03:12:46,810
Massachusetts,

7592
03:12:46,870 --> 03:12:47,261
legal,

7593
03:12:47,261 --> 03:12:47,800
legal.

7594
03:12:47,800 --> 03:12:48,400
Wow.

7595
03:12:48,400 --> 03:12:49,510
There's a bunch of states now,

7596
03:12:49,900 --> 03:12:50,261
you know,

7597
03:12:50,261 --> 03:12:51,920
and now all of Canada,

7598
03:12:52,190 --> 03:12:53,023
all of candidates,

7599
03:12:53,150 --> 03:12:56,120
October 17th Canada
fucking went whole hog.

7600
03:12:56,180 --> 03:12:57,230
Now what if it could do it again?

7601
03:12:57,740 --> 03:12:59,300
Canada salute you.

7602
03:12:59,301 --> 03:13:00,810
Bad mother fuckers.

7603
03:13:01,400 --> 03:13:02,810
Finally constellations.

7604
03:13:02,960 --> 03:13:04,490
That's a beautiful thing they did.

7605
03:13:04,520 --> 03:13:07,850
They made it legal ash nationwide hour
before the first guy got pulled over for

7606
03:13:07,851 --> 03:13:08,750
smoking weed in this car.

7607
03:13:11,120 --> 03:13:12,080
Probably right now.

7608
03:13:12,090 --> 03:13:12,711
That's what it was.

7609
03:13:12,711 --> 03:13:14,240
It was an hour after
it was fully legalize.

7610
03:13:14,250 --> 03:13:16,160
The guy busted for
smoking weed in the car.

7611
03:13:16,180 --> 03:13:16,800
Don't do that.

7612
03:13:16,800 --> 03:13:18,080
Well we before you get in the car,

7613
03:13:18,081 --> 03:13:19,190
you idiot on stupid.

7614
03:13:19,790 --> 03:13:20,623
Don't be ridiculous.

7615
03:13:21,080 --> 03:13:21,291
Yeah,

7616
03:13:21,291 --> 03:13:24,170
but that was when my favorite
memories of UFC is having that thing.

7617
03:13:24,260 --> 03:13:27,950
We had some good God damn times and it
was funny that it took me a long time to

7618
03:13:27,951 --> 03:13:30,620
figure out that I could
combine the UFC and comedy.

7619
03:13:30,680 --> 03:13:30,861
Yeah.

7620
03:13:30,861 --> 03:13:33,320
I remember you taking this with us
a few times and then I was like,

7621
03:13:33,321 --> 03:13:33,471
two,

7622
03:13:33,471 --> 03:13:35,090
why are we doing nothing on Friday nights?

7623
03:13:35,400 --> 03:13:35,600
And like,

7624
03:13:35,600 --> 03:13:35,931
what do you mean?

7625
03:13:35,931 --> 03:13:37,370
Like I can't schedule a show.

7626
03:13:37,371 --> 03:13:38,480
Can you schedule a show?

7627
03:13:38,510 --> 03:13:39,020
Yeah,

7628
03:13:39,020 --> 03:13:40,460
I mean we're going to
do guest spot somewhere.

7629
03:13:40,490 --> 03:13:40,910
Yeah,

7630
03:13:40,910 --> 03:13:42,140
let's just make a couple of bucks.

7631
03:13:42,170 --> 03:13:42,620
What did we,

7632
03:13:42,620 --> 03:13:43,820
how did we start doing it?

7633
03:13:43,970 --> 03:13:44,803
I think we would,

7634
03:13:45,050 --> 03:13:49,220
I think honestly when we did like the
Pearl or something court Macau and we'd be

7635
03:13:49,221 --> 03:13:49,431
like,

7636
03:13:49,431 --> 03:13:49,731
Hey,

7637
03:13:49,731 --> 03:13:51,230
if you want to come in and do a set,

7638
03:13:51,231 --> 03:13:52,064
you can like,

7639
03:13:52,070 --> 03:13:53,030
like dom Irrera.

7640
03:13:54,010 --> 03:13:54,350
He's like,

7641
03:13:54,350 --> 03:13:54,940
he'll come to a site.

7642
03:13:54,940 --> 03:13:56,210
I remember smoking cigars with me,

7643
03:13:56,211 --> 03:13:56,451
you,

7644
03:13:56,451 --> 03:13:57,320
him,

7645
03:13:57,500 --> 03:13:58,251
Kevin James,

7646
03:13:58,251 --> 03:13:59,630
and just like the common bar.

7647
03:14:00,470 --> 03:14:01,460
I hated those clubs,

7648
03:14:01,461 --> 03:14:04,110
but there's common bars
were the best and we were,

7649
03:14:04,240 --> 03:14:05,470
we could sneak around back then

7650
03:14:07,130 --> 03:14:08,120
we didn't get mobbed.

7651
03:14:09,020 --> 03:14:10,250
And then eventually it was like,

7652
03:14:10,280 --> 03:14:10,401
hey,

7653
03:14:10,401 --> 03:14:12,200
instead of just doing an
occasional guest spots,

7654
03:14:12,230 --> 03:14:13,160
why don't we do clubs?

7655
03:14:13,161 --> 03:14:14,210
And the clubs would get full.

7656
03:14:14,210 --> 03:14:17,680
I remember guide toward doing something
maybe in Omaha and it was like,

7657
03:14:17,681 --> 03:14:17,771
well,

7658
03:14:17,771 --> 03:14:19,130
how about a midnight Friday show?

7659
03:14:19,190 --> 03:14:19,821
Can we do that?

7660
03:14:19,821 --> 03:14:21,020
You don't want to bump anybody.

7661
03:14:21,050 --> 03:14:21,800
Right.

7662
03:14:21,800 --> 03:14:23,690
But then you would schedule
it months and months out.

7663
03:14:23,691 --> 03:14:24,800
So nobody was scheduled.

7664
03:14:25,610 --> 03:14:26,460
And then theaters,

7665
03:14:26,461 --> 03:14:27,620
it was just one night anyway.

7666
03:14:28,250 --> 03:14:29,083
Um,

7667
03:14:29,420 --> 03:14:30,500
and it was just became like,

7668
03:14:30,501 --> 03:14:33,500
we're not wasting time
doing these fun UFC stuff.

7669
03:14:33,501 --> 03:14:34,730
We're actually working.

7670
03:14:35,030 --> 03:14:36,080
If you ever want to do those again,

7671
03:14:36,081 --> 03:14:36,560
man,

7672
03:14:36,560 --> 03:14:37,400
we could do some.

7673
03:14:37,490 --> 03:14:39,580
It became harder as I started
headlining to be like,

7674
03:14:39,730 --> 03:14:40,940
I got to give up time

7675
03:14:42,440 --> 03:14:43,490
to go do that.

7676
03:14:43,820 --> 03:14:45,260
I remember one time it was a,

7677
03:14:45,770 --> 03:14:46,071
you were like,

7678
03:14:46,071 --> 03:14:46,970
can you come to Dallas?

7679
03:14:46,971 --> 03:14:49,010
You know how there's like shows
that are important to you.

7680
03:14:49,670 --> 03:14:51,200
It might not be the
most money or anything,

7681
03:14:51,201 --> 03:14:52,340
but it's important to you.

7682
03:14:52,900 --> 03:14:53,733
Um,

7683
03:14:53,930 --> 03:14:54,501
case in point,

7684
03:14:54,501 --> 03:14:56,870
I went in to do the Wilbur my
first time doing the Wilbur,

7685
03:14:57,260 --> 03:14:57,920
you know,

7686
03:14:57,920 --> 03:15:00,470
and that was one of the ones I
remember you doing the opening for you.

7687
03:15:00,470 --> 03:15:01,820
And then I'm doing two shows.

7688
03:15:01,830 --> 03:15:02,241
The Wilbur,

7689
03:15:02,241 --> 03:15:02,451
I'm like,

7690
03:15:02,451 --> 03:15:02,751
this is,

7691
03:15:02,751 --> 03:15:07,160
I want to show Boston's an important
comedy city so that I was like,

7692
03:15:07,190 --> 03:15:08,660
I needed to get like a really good,

7693
03:15:08,790 --> 03:15:09,650
it was just somebody,

7694
03:15:09,651 --> 03:15:10,371
I got Joe list.

7695
03:15:10,371 --> 03:15:10,611
It was like,

7696
03:15:10,611 --> 03:15:12,410
you're a headline or I
need you to open for me.

7697
03:15:12,950 --> 03:15:16,310
And luckily he been opened for
Louis and his schedule became clear.

7698
03:15:16,750 --> 03:15:17,530
Um,

7699
03:15:17,530 --> 03:15:19,680
because lucky for us,

7700
03:15:19,681 --> 03:15:20,840
that's how I opened every show.

7701
03:15:21,180 --> 03:15:22,013
Lucky for us.

7702
03:15:22,280 --> 03:15:23,113
Uh,

7703
03:15:23,420 --> 03:15:23,990
but um,

7704
03:15:23,990 --> 03:15:24,231
yeah,

7705
03:15:24,231 --> 03:15:24,801
and you were like,

7706
03:15:24,801 --> 03:15:26,090
you had to show in Dallas and you're like,

7707
03:15:26,091 --> 03:15:26,541
can you do it?

7708
03:15:26,541 --> 03:15:26,721
I'm like,

7709
03:15:26,721 --> 03:15:28,220
I'm doing the fucking San Francisco,

7710
03:15:28,221 --> 03:15:28,460
um,

7711
03:15:28,460 --> 03:15:29,211
comedy festivals.

7712
03:15:29,211 --> 03:15:29,990
Like how much you can pay it.

7713
03:15:29,990 --> 03:15:30,711
Like honestly,

7714
03:15:30,711 --> 03:15:31,431
like 400 bucks.

7715
03:15:31,431 --> 03:15:32,031
It's not about that.

7716
03:15:32,031 --> 03:15:33,290
I agreed and you're like,

7717
03:15:33,320 --> 03:15:34,400
I'll give you $5,000.

7718
03:15:34,670 --> 03:15:35,503
I'll cancel now.

7719
03:15:38,960 --> 03:15:41,000
Let me get off the phone right
now and I'll go ahead and finish.

7720
03:15:41,120 --> 03:15:43,280
You can't do it cause
it would be more fun.

7721
03:15:43,310 --> 03:15:43,551
Yeah,

7722
03:15:43,551 --> 03:15:44,384
there's that too.

7723
03:15:44,740 --> 03:15:46,160
Who would you be more fun?

7724
03:15:46,161 --> 03:15:46,790
I mean,

7725
03:15:46,790 --> 03:15:50,160
we've had some fucking fun man last

7726
03:15:50,160 --> 03:15:51,830
and when I talked to
people about the road,

7727
03:15:51,831 --> 03:15:52,380
the gall,

7728
03:15:52,380 --> 03:15:53,550
the road is lonely.

7729
03:15:53,551 --> 03:15:53,950
The roads.

7730
03:15:53,950 --> 03:15:54,570
I'm like,

7731
03:15:54,570 --> 03:15:55,650
you're doing it wrong.

7732
03:15:55,910 --> 03:15:57,540
It's supposed to do
with your best friends.

7733
03:15:57,630 --> 03:15:58,890
Do some fun shit with it.

7734
03:15:58,891 --> 03:16:02,010
I try to stay later on Sunday
and go hiking if it's like,

7735
03:16:02,011 --> 03:16:02,460
oh yeah,

7736
03:16:02,460 --> 03:16:04,200
if it's cold in New
York and I'm an Austin,

7737
03:16:04,201 --> 03:16:06,930
fucking stay in the warmth a
little bit and do something fun.

7738
03:16:06,960 --> 03:16:07,710
That's a good move,

7739
03:16:07,710 --> 03:16:08,041
you know?

7740
03:16:08,041 --> 03:16:08,341
But yeah,

7741
03:16:08,341 --> 03:16:10,860
but you and your friends is the
number one way to turn that thing,

7742
03:16:10,861 --> 03:16:11,490
man.

7743
03:16:11,490 --> 03:16:11,671
You know,

7744
03:16:11,671 --> 03:16:12,570
the entourage thing,

7745
03:16:12,571 --> 03:16:13,231
when we did that,

7746
03:16:13,231 --> 03:16:13,930
it was too big.

7747
03:16:13,930 --> 03:16:14,960
It's too much trouble.

7748
03:16:15,030 --> 03:16:15,870
It's too much work.

7749
03:16:15,960 --> 03:16:17,880
It's too hard to organize
and get everybody together.

7750
03:16:17,910 --> 03:16:19,500
And it was too much pressure on me.

7751
03:16:19,950 --> 03:16:20,191
I was like,

7752
03:16:20,191 --> 03:16:20,941
I don't want to deal with this.

7753
03:16:20,941 --> 03:16:23,610
I just want you gotta be an
administrator too with all those people.

7754
03:16:24,120 --> 03:16:26,430
Two openers or two acts with me.

7755
03:16:26,431 --> 03:16:27,264
It's too much work.

7756
03:16:27,270 --> 03:16:28,680
One person is fine.

7757
03:16:28,710 --> 03:16:32,240
The only reason you brought a
second opener because the one open,

7758
03:16:32,250 --> 03:16:33,800
it was so irresponsible.

7759
03:16:33,820 --> 03:16:35,160
You couldn't trust that he'd be there.

7760
03:16:35,310 --> 03:16:39,300
But he was so brilliant that I refused
to not hire him whenever I could work

7761
03:16:39,301 --> 03:16:39,440
with.

7762
03:16:39,440 --> 03:16:41,730
The obvious answer is get someone else.

7763
03:16:42,210 --> 03:16:42,721
But you were like,

7764
03:16:42,721 --> 03:16:43,320
no,

7765
03:16:43,320 --> 03:16:44,760
I'll get a buffer in case.

7766
03:16:45,300 --> 03:16:45,571
Well,

7767
03:16:45,571 --> 03:16:48,870
my feeling on Diaz Zoe's
like I have a special,

7768
03:16:48,871 --> 03:16:51,400
I've always had a special place
in my heart for him because I,

7769
03:16:51,420 --> 03:16:55,540
he reminded me so much at my friend Johnny
Johnny be from New York who taught at

7770
03:16:55,541 --> 03:16:56,340
the pool player.

7771
03:16:56,340 --> 03:16:56,820
Yeah.

7772
03:16:56,820 --> 03:16:58,830
And like I knew what Joey was,

7773
03:16:58,831 --> 03:17:02,190
he's just brilliant guy who had
a really hard time with reality,

7774
03:17:02,460 --> 03:17:02,781
with,

7775
03:17:02,781 --> 03:17:03,420
with re,

7776
03:17:03,420 --> 03:17:04,080
with life,

7777
03:17:04,080 --> 03:17:05,160
with civilization.

7778
03:17:05,161 --> 03:17:05,820
He was just,

7779
03:17:05,820 --> 03:17:08,550
but in those moments of brilliance,

7780
03:17:08,700 --> 03:17:10,020
he was worth everything to me.

7781
03:17:10,260 --> 03:17:10,861
So I was like,

7782
03:17:10,861 --> 03:17:11,580
look,

7783
03:17:11,580 --> 03:17:16,200
what I'm going to try to do with this
guy is I'm going to try to somehow or

7784
03:17:16,201 --> 03:17:17,010
another,

7785
03:17:17,010 --> 03:17:18,210
because I had,

7786
03:17:19,140 --> 03:17:20,520
I was in main stream,

7787
03:17:20,880 --> 03:17:22,380
I had a television show,

7788
03:17:22,440 --> 03:17:25,440
pull them in clubs that I could headline.

7789
03:17:25,620 --> 03:17:25,981
I'm like,

7790
03:17:25,981 --> 03:17:29,850
I'm going to bring this guy into the
world and I'm going to show them how I do

7791
03:17:29,851 --> 03:17:32,310
it and I'm going to like indoctrinate him.

7792
03:17:32,311 --> 03:17:32,940
I'm gonna,

7793
03:17:32,940 --> 03:17:33,773
I'm gonna.

7794
03:17:33,810 --> 03:17:34,531
You know what I mean?

7795
03:17:34,531 --> 03:17:37,980
He's older than me and I respect him
and I'm not like a mentor to him,

7796
03:17:37,981 --> 03:17:42,981
but I am someone who was more advanced
in comedy and but was a giant fan of Joey

7797
03:17:45,890 --> 03:17:45,900
Dhea.

7798
03:17:45,900 --> 03:17:46,470
So it was like,

7799
03:17:46,470 --> 03:17:50,190
I just want to figure out a way where
the it can work for this guy because I

7800
03:17:50,191 --> 03:17:55,191
know if this guys is out there hustling
and being crazy and doing coke,

7801
03:17:55,230 --> 03:17:55,880
it's just,

7802
03:17:55,880 --> 03:17:59,540
it's going to go off the rails
like whatever I can do to,

7803
03:17:59,840 --> 03:18:04,840
and I think it helped him that
someone who was established who,

7804
03:18:04,920 --> 03:18:05,753
Oh,

7805
03:18:05,770 --> 03:18:07,710
a guy who legitimately me.

7806
03:18:07,750 --> 03:18:09,270
It didn't give a fuck what he did.

7807
03:18:09,271 --> 03:18:10,890
I wanted him to be myself.

7808
03:18:11,100 --> 03:18:12,030
I want to be at south.

7809
03:18:12,100 --> 03:18:13,860
We would love to wild with the owner,

7810
03:18:13,870 --> 03:18:14,490
be fun.

7811
03:18:14,490 --> 03:18:15,240
I don't care.

7812
03:18:15,240 --> 03:18:17,460
I never cared about what went on.

7813
03:18:17,490 --> 03:18:17,970
I wanted,

7814
03:18:17,970 --> 03:18:19,500
I wanted fun for everybody.

7815
03:18:19,680 --> 03:18:20,220
Like that was,

7816
03:18:20,220 --> 03:18:22,240
it was important for me
that I'd be the only one.

7817
03:18:22,390 --> 03:18:24,720
That's one of the biggest
poisons ever with comics.

7818
03:18:24,990 --> 03:18:27,480
Be the only funny one or on the headliner.

7819
03:18:27,481 --> 03:18:28,680
I'm the only one who kills.

7820
03:18:28,681 --> 03:18:29,051
And you,

7821
03:18:29,051 --> 03:18:32,310
you guys are doing too well or are you
guys are doing too much time for me it

7822
03:18:32,311 --> 03:18:33,870
was like go have fun.

7823
03:18:34,080 --> 03:18:35,220
We're here to party.

7824
03:18:35,460 --> 03:18:36,293
This is a party.

7825
03:18:37,530 --> 03:18:39,030
I mean I just did way too long.

7826
03:18:39,090 --> 03:18:39,751
It was just me and you.

7827
03:18:39,751 --> 03:18:44,030
I think I did 44 minutes and red
bands like two do are like 45 minutes.

7828
03:18:44,031 --> 03:18:44,251
I was like,

7829
03:18:44,251 --> 03:18:44,401
no,

7830
03:18:44,401 --> 03:18:45,350
I did that for,

7831
03:18:45,360 --> 03:18:46,430
just didn't realize it.

7832
03:18:46,440 --> 03:18:46,681
He was like,

7833
03:18:46,681 --> 03:18:47,020
you did?

7834
03:18:47,020 --> 03:18:47,290
I'm like,

7835
03:18:47,290 --> 03:18:50,170
there's no way I did 25 or 30
but that's such a good club.

7836
03:18:50,171 --> 03:18:51,520
The comedy works and he goes,

7837
03:18:51,820 --> 03:18:53,500
I recorded it on video.

7838
03:18:53,501 --> 03:18:55,390
I can show you the starting
point in the any point.

7839
03:18:55,391 --> 03:18:56,170
And he did and I was like,

7840
03:18:56,170 --> 03:18:57,100
oh fuck.

7841
03:18:57,310 --> 03:18:58,121
I've told you this before.

7842
03:18:58,121 --> 03:18:58,460
But,

7843
03:18:58,460 --> 03:18:59,051
but I was like,

7844
03:18:59,051 --> 03:18:59,231
dude,

7845
03:18:59,231 --> 03:19:00,250
I am so sorry.

7846
03:19:00,430 --> 03:19:01,150
That was way wrong.

7847
03:19:01,150 --> 03:19:01,241
Like,

7848
03:19:01,241 --> 03:19:01,630
no,

7849
03:19:01,630 --> 03:19:02,380
it didn't matter.

7850
03:19:02,380 --> 03:19:02,621
I like,

7851
03:19:02,621 --> 03:19:02,701
no,

7852
03:19:02,701 --> 03:19:02,951
no,

7853
03:19:02,951 --> 03:19:03,641
I'm really,

7854
03:19:03,641 --> 03:19:04,161
I'm really sorry.

7855
03:19:04,161 --> 03:19:04,330
He goes,

7856
03:19:04,330 --> 03:19:04,461
no,

7857
03:19:04,461 --> 03:19:04,570
no,

7858
03:19:04,570 --> 03:19:05,081
it didn't matter.

7859
03:19:05,081 --> 03:19:05,350
I'm like,

7860
03:19:05,350 --> 03:19:05,711
no,

7861
03:19:05,711 --> 03:19:06,431
but I shouldn't do that.

7862
03:19:06,431 --> 03:19:06,611
You're like,

7863
03:19:06,611 --> 03:19:06,741
no,

7864
03:19:06,741 --> 03:19:07,120
no,

7865
03:19:07,120 --> 03:19:07,953
you killed.

7866
03:19:08,230 --> 03:19:10,210
And then I went up and killed.

7867
03:19:10,810 --> 03:19:14,680
So you haven't made a connection to
me where it does actually matter.

7868
03:19:14,850 --> 03:19:16,200
Does we both killed?

7869
03:19:16,290 --> 03:19:20,080
Why is it an issue if it goes off
the rails one time and you go long,

7870
03:19:20,081 --> 03:19:20,970
like who gives a shit?

7871
03:19:20,970 --> 03:19:21,110
Yeah,

7872
03:19:21,110 --> 03:19:22,060
that's not a consistent thing.

7873
03:19:23,230 --> 03:19:24,410
The whole thing to,

7874
03:19:24,670 --> 03:19:25,900
to all of us,

7875
03:19:25,901 --> 03:19:26,590
she'd be,

7876
03:19:26,590 --> 03:19:27,730
we know the process chart,

7877
03:19:27,740 --> 03:19:30,940
some shit have fun and the
audience has a great time.

7878
03:19:30,970 --> 03:19:31,803
That's what I all,

7879
03:19:31,840 --> 03:19:36,840
that's all I wanted and like to have also
that stand up wasn't something that I

7880
03:19:37,811 --> 03:19:39,670
had to do for money.

7881
03:19:40,090 --> 03:19:43,870
Like stand up was almost
like supplementing,

7882
03:19:44,260 --> 03:19:44,861
whether it was news,

7883
03:19:44,861 --> 03:19:46,930
radio money or fear factor money.

7884
03:19:46,931 --> 03:19:48,730
It's like a had all this money that I,

7885
03:19:48,760 --> 03:19:49,593
I could,

7886
03:19:49,600 --> 03:19:50,520
my bills were okay.

7887
03:19:50,560 --> 03:19:51,400
I was okay.

7888
03:19:51,520 --> 03:19:52,660
I didn't have to think about it.

7889
03:19:52,870 --> 03:19:55,900
So I didn't worry about
getting kicked out of clubs.

7890
03:19:56,050 --> 03:19:58,270
I didn't worry about not getting booked.

7891
03:19:58,271 --> 03:19:58,630
I'm like,

7892
03:19:58,630 --> 03:19:59,470
so what?

7893
03:19:59,850 --> 03:20:04,030
Like we're here to have fun and we rolled
through the entire country like that

7894
03:20:04,240 --> 03:20:05,140
and it worked out.

7895
03:20:05,170 --> 03:20:05,890
It was fun.

7896
03:20:05,890 --> 03:20:06,671
God Damn Dude,

7897
03:20:06,671 --> 03:20:08,230
we had the time of our lives.

7898
03:20:08,380 --> 03:20:09,490
When you look back,

7899
03:20:09,491 --> 03:20:11,650
if we look back as you know,

7900
03:20:11,750 --> 03:20:14,230
senior citizens at the fucking,

7901
03:20:14,530 --> 03:20:19,530
the rare great times that we had
consistently all across the country,

7902
03:20:20,200 --> 03:20:21,820
the offstage stuff was stuff great.

7903
03:20:21,870 --> 03:20:21,990
Uh,

7904
03:20:21,990 --> 03:20:26,350
for me onstage it was getting more stage
time that I would get in La and I was

7905
03:20:26,351 --> 03:20:29,110
getting this weird exposure to an
actual good crowd where I could like

7906
03:20:29,350 --> 03:20:30,580
experiment with pausing.

7907
03:20:30,820 --> 03:20:34,210
I wouldn't be afraid of losing a crowd
if I shows you do and a half hour

7908
03:20:34,211 --> 03:20:35,044
consistently,

7909
03:20:35,140 --> 03:20:36,130
two shows a night.

7910
03:20:36,210 --> 03:20:36,941
I was talking to Michelle,

7911
03:20:36,941 --> 03:20:37,780
she just went to what will,

7912
03:20:37,790 --> 03:20:38,770
if she just went to a,

7913
03:20:38,830 --> 03:20:40,330
I think commerce for the
first time and I was like,

7914
03:20:40,331 --> 03:20:40,841
oh how was it?

7915
03:20:40,841 --> 03:20:41,140
She goes,

7916
03:20:41,140 --> 03:20:41,921
it's not fair.

7917
03:20:41,921 --> 03:20:43,030
They're laughing at setups.

7918
03:20:43,060 --> 03:20:44,710
It's just too good at
it doesn't make sense.

7919
03:20:44,711 --> 03:20:45,940
I'm like it's a victory lap.

7920
03:20:45,941 --> 03:20:46,774
You should enjoy it.

7921
03:20:46,780 --> 03:20:49,780
And then I remember like I think that
might've been the first time I went with

7922
03:20:49,781 --> 03:20:53,410
Brogan was and I was doing
so well but he's like,

7923
03:20:53,470 --> 03:20:54,670
oh you're coming with me again.

7924
03:20:54,850 --> 03:20:55,760
It was almost like,

7925
03:20:56,440 --> 03:20:58,510
like it was unfair showcase.

7926
03:20:58,710 --> 03:21:01,060
You know why I already
knew you were funny.

7927
03:21:01,260 --> 03:21:01,500
Yeah,

7928
03:21:01,500 --> 03:21:01,650
that's,

7929
03:21:01,650 --> 03:21:03,160
that's why you asked me to
go with one with first place,

7930
03:21:03,161 --> 03:21:03,660
but like,

7931
03:21:03,660 --> 03:21:04,481
but I was like,

7932
03:21:04,481 --> 03:21:06,760
this is the perfect club
for anybody to try out in.

7933
03:21:06,761 --> 03:21:07,850
Cause it's so sad.

7934
03:21:07,851 --> 03:21:10,120
It's like a wind assisted
a hundred yard dash,

7935
03:21:10,300 --> 03:21:10,630
you know,

7936
03:21:10,630 --> 03:21:12,040
with heavy gusts of wind.

7937
03:21:12,070 --> 03:21:12,491
Right.

7938
03:21:12,491 --> 03:21:13,840
It's almost like you have a sale.

7939
03:21:13,900 --> 03:21:14,480
Yeah,

7940
03:21:14,480 --> 03:21:15,100
yeah,

7941
03:21:15,100 --> 03:21:15,880
yeah.

7942
03:21:15,880 --> 03:21:16,091
Oh,

7943
03:21:16,091 --> 03:21:16,810
they were fun.

7944
03:21:16,810 --> 03:21:16,931
Yeah.

7945
03:21:16,931 --> 03:21:18,220
We had a great fucking time dude.

7946
03:21:18,400 --> 03:21:18,631
But at,

7947
03:21:18,631 --> 03:21:19,181
and it works.

7948
03:21:19,181 --> 03:21:19,451
Look,

7949
03:21:19,451 --> 03:21:19,661
I mean,

7950
03:21:19,661 --> 03:21:22,180
look how all the people that went with us,

7951
03:21:22,181 --> 03:21:26,260
whether it's Diaz or
Dunkin or you or Segura,

7952
03:21:26,500 --> 03:21:28,690
they're murdering now
all over the country,

7953
03:21:28,780 --> 03:21:29,560
murdering,

7954
03:21:29,560 --> 03:21:30,520
doing quite well.

7955
03:21:30,640 --> 03:21:32,020
If I was a talent scout dude,

7956
03:21:32,021 --> 03:21:33,520
I'd be 100% no,

7957
03:21:33,521 --> 03:21:35,320
you would not think harder.

7958
03:21:36,560 --> 03:21:37,090
Okay.

7959
03:21:37,090 --> 03:21:38,560
It's not because I was
going to write down a name,

7960
03:21:38,561 --> 03:21:38,941
but you're not.

7961
03:21:38,941 --> 03:21:39,650
You're not.

7962
03:21:39,650 --> 03:21:41,170
You're not 100% got him clothes.

7963
03:21:41,200 --> 03:21:43,760
Do you have a great percentage of
the people that I wasn't 100% on,

7964
03:21:43,780 --> 03:21:44,710
they failed themselves.

7965
03:21:44,810 --> 03:21:46,200
They had the potential of the bay

7966
03:21:46,290 --> 03:21:47,123
and then it's on them.

7967
03:21:47,420 --> 03:21:47,870
Well,

7968
03:21:47,870 --> 03:21:49,940
discipline is something
that a lot of people lack,

7969
03:21:49,941 --> 03:21:50,300
man.

7970
03:21:50,300 --> 03:21:51,021
And it's not very,

7971
03:21:51,021 --> 03:21:51,920
very unfortunate.

7972
03:21:52,040 --> 03:21:53,060
And we're seeing it right now.

7973
03:21:53,061 --> 03:21:53,361
Bert.

7974
03:21:53,361 --> 03:21:55,250
Kreischer you're behind
by a thousand points.

7975
03:21:55,251 --> 03:21:56,084
Motherfucker.

7976
03:21:57,520 --> 03:21:58,940
Can I promote two days before we go?

7977
03:21:59,330 --> 03:22:00,680
I'm doing a lot of reading of the,

7978
03:22:00,681 --> 03:22:01,221
of a,

7979
03:22:01,221 --> 03:22:01,640
um,

7980
03:22:01,640 --> 03:22:03,020
with the indigent O'Neil in New York.

7981
03:22:03,021 --> 03:22:05,090
November 11th of the
screenplay I wrote in college.

7982
03:22:05,120 --> 03:22:05,331
Oh,

7983
03:22:05,331 --> 03:22:07,330
I've been hearing about this and Oh,

7984
03:22:07,340 --> 03:22:07,791
by the way,

7985
03:22:07,791 --> 03:22:11,240
it's horrible podcast on sober October
when you're walking around New York.

7986
03:22:11,241 --> 03:22:12,410
It's God damn awesome.

7987
03:22:12,470 --> 03:22:14,270
I'm so angry and full
of fucking withdrawal.

7988
03:22:16,880 --> 03:22:17,031
My,

7989
03:22:17,031 --> 03:22:18,320
you're my favorite when you're angry.

7990
03:22:18,530 --> 03:22:18,910
Angry.

7991
03:22:18,910 --> 03:22:19,790
Ari's my favorite.

7992
03:22:19,791 --> 03:22:20,160
All right.

7993
03:22:20,160 --> 03:22:21,370
When you still fuck it.

7994
03:22:23,060 --> 03:22:23,720
That's,

7995
03:22:23,720 --> 03:22:24,800
that's my favorite Aria.

7996
03:22:26,330 --> 03:22:28,790
And then I got a European
door coming November and uh,

7997
03:22:28,791 --> 03:22:29,624
and uh,

7998
03:22:29,780 --> 03:22:31,900
November 16 starts in
Reykjavik and it ends November,

7999
03:22:32,150 --> 03:22:32,801
December 9th.

8000
03:22:32,801 --> 03:22:34,310
Then Zurich can all sorts of cities.

8001
03:22:34,311 --> 03:22:37,550
So please already the
great.com for tickets.

8002
03:22:37,610 --> 03:22:38,443
Um,

8003
03:22:38,600 --> 03:22:40,160
I love to see out there Brussels,

8004
03:22:40,340 --> 03:22:41,470
I'm Sadam Copenhagen,

8005
03:22:41,480 --> 03:22:42,320
all sorts of places.

8006
03:22:42,380 --> 03:22:43,213
Boom.

8007
03:22:43,570 --> 03:22:44,600
There's 10 more days,

8008
03:22:44,601 --> 03:22:45,440
ladies and gentlemen,

8009
03:22:45,500 --> 03:22:49,940
as head more days and then grew that
hair on 10 more days and then we're going

8010
03:22:49,941 --> 03:22:50,774
crazy.

8011
03:22:50,960 --> 03:22:51,810
I can't wait until then.

8012
03:22:52,210 --> 03:22:56,150
We'll be the wrap up show where
someone besides Bert Kreischer.

8013
03:22:56,151 --> 03:22:57,680
We'll get that championship belt.

8014
03:22:57,740 --> 03:22:58,730
I might go workout right now.

8015
03:22:58,880 --> 03:22:59,840
I'm gonna go work out right now.

8016
03:23:00,440 --> 03:23:02,780
I have to twist the blade.

8017
03:23:03,150 --> 03:23:03,920
All right.

8018
03:23:03,920 --> 03:23:04,400
Bye Buddy.
