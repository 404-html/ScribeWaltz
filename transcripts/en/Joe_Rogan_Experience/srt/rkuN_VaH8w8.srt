1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,530
What are you guys gonna play?

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,981
Oh,

4
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:04,814
sorry.

5
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,990
We can play a song called big man.

6
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,250
My good friends.

7
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:09,140
The only band I've ever worked with ever.

8
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:09,974
In real life.

9
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,153
What are you gonna play?

10
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,243
Big Man.

11
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,593
What's happening?

12
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,300
That's the song we're
going to play real life.

13
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,170
Well,

14

the only with us,

15
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,700
Tony played some drums.

16
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:21,180
I feel like you could get some drums.

17
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,430
I want to just watch.

18
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,930
Do too many things.

19
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,053
Play drums.

20
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,970
Super Group

21
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,430
means skin on

22
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,313
the penis.

23
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,233
Obvious here.

24
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,401
This.

25
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:38,234
Okay guys.

26
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,813
Let it go.

27
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,730
Hey,

28
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,563
how's that work?

29
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,300
Oh,

30
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,133
good.

31
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,853
Yup.

32
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,213
Okay.

33
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,003
Oh,

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,870
when the pig man,

35
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,350
they spill Bucky.

36
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,683
Oh

37
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,820
No.

38
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,793
Damn.

39
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,823
Damn.

40
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,163
Okay.

41
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,763
Wait.

42
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,413
Ooh.

43
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,700
And they came,

44
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,673
uh,

45
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,010
to the funeral.

46
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,900
Hey Jane called.

47
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,430
Hey

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,033
Man.

49
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,140
Damn man.

50
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,443
Okay.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,330
You can try her head off.

52
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,190
They be

53
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,750
part of some big plan.

54
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:43,870
Maybe no one should ever die

55
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,630
down.

56
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,860
Low

57
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,570
bones buried

58
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,413
bones.

59
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Barry de Bono's out wall shea

60
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,830

61
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,623

62
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,523

63
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,720
old pain.

64
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,923
Yeah.

65
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,003
Awesome.

66
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,280
That's a beautiful song.

67
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,143
Shit.

68
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,860
Nice mine.

69
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,350
Is that one of the ones going
to be in the new special?

70
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,100
That's it.

71
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,401
Yeah.

72
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:08,450
That's what you're shooting for.

73
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,940
Do you guys have a name for the record?

74
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,553
No,

75
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,443
not yet.

76
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,800
We're open to my ideas.

77
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,310
Okay.
