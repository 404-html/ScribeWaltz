1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,530
What are you guys gonna play?

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,981
Oh,

4
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:04,814
sorry.

5
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,990
We can play a song called big man.

6
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,250
My good friends.

7
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:09,140
The only band I've ever worked with ever.

8
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:09,974
In real life.

9
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,153
What are you gonna play?

10
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,243
Big Man.

11
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,593
What's happening?

12
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:15,801
That's the song.

13
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:17,300
We're going to play real life.

14
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,170
Well,

15
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,840

16
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,700
Tony played some drums.

17
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:21,180
I feel like you could get some drums.

18
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,430
I want to just watch.

19
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,930
Do too many things.

20
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,053
Play drums.

21
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,970
Super Group

22
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,430
means skin on

23
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,313
the penis.

24
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,233
Obvious here.

25
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,401
This.

26
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:38,234
Okay guys.

27
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,813
Let it go.

28
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,730
Hey,

29
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,563
how's that work?

30
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,300
Oh,

31
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,133
good.

32
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,853
Yup.

33
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,213
Okay.

34
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,003
Oh,

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,920
when the pig man,

36
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,350
they spill Bucky.

37
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,683
Oh

38
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,820

39
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,373
man,

40
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,643
baby.

41
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,163
Okay,

42
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,763
wait.

43
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,413
Ooh.

44
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,700
And they came,

45
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,673
uh,

46
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,010
to the funeral.

47
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,880
Hey Jay called.

48
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,430
Hey.

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,170
Damn man.

50
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,890
Damn man.

51
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,443
Okay.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,180
You can try her head off baby.

53
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,773
Oh,

54
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,750
part of some big plan.

55
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:43,480
Maybe no one should ever low

56
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,890
down low

57
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,570
bones buried

58
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,413
bones.

59
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Barry de Bono's out wall shea

60
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,830
to sleep

61
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,623

62
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,523

63
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,720
old pain.

64
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,923
Yeah.

65
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,003
Awesome.

66
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,280
That's a beautiful song.

67
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,143
Shit.

68
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,860
Nice mine.

69
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,350
Is that one of the ones going
to be in the new special?

70
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,100
That's it.

71
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,401
Yeah.

72
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:08,450
That's what you're shooting for.

73
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,940
Do you guys have a name for the record?

74
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,610
No,

75
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,211
not yet,

76
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:15,800
but we're open to ideas.

77
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,310
Okay.
