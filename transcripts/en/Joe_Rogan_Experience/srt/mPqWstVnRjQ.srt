1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,660
And we're live.
All right,

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,590
Paul,
first of all,

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,600
welcome.
Thank you for coming here.

4
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:16,601
And you are probably one of the most 
requested people from the Internet that 

5
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:17,060
I've ever had.
So feel good about that.

6
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:22,061
And I'm honored.
And he the first guy ever to wear a 

7
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:22,061
mushroom hat.
Okay.

8
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:22,220
That's really a hat made out of 
mushrooms.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,000
It's made from this on the do mushroom.
Um,

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,120
it's called families from materials.
It grows on birch trees throughout the 

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,621
world.
But this is an example of why I think 

12
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:35,720
shamanistic Lee plants mushrooms become 
significant.

13
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:40,721
There's a plurality of benefits.
So this mushrooms a fire starter 

14
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:42,530
mushroom.
It allowed for the portability of fire.

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,120
There's no doubt that we came from 
Africa.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,240
We migrated north,
we discovered something new called 

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,240
winter.
Oops.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,970
This allowed for the portability of 
fire.

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,420
You can hollow this mushroom output 
embers of a fire inside and carry fire 

20
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:55,420
for days.

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,520
If your clan could not rekindle fire in 
Europe in the wintertime,

22
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,620
you would die.
So when you.

23
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,320
This has actually made by some ladies in
Transylvania.

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,420
Can I feel that?
Yeah.

25
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,960
And it's a hard wood.
Conk.

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,340
Oh Wow.
But when you soak it in lye water,

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,420
ashes and water it,
the laminate's into this fabric.

28
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,100
Oh,
let me feel that.

29
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,500
It's very soft.
It's also called German felt.

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,400
Wow.
It's extremely flammable.

31
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,960
So it revolutionized warfare because Don
Nepal,

32
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,980
iconic napoleonic times,
this is the punk that ignited gunpowder.

33
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,480
So even the Chinese invented the Chinese
invented gunpowder,

34
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:40,481
the Europeans and then had the rifle.
So this allowed flint spark guns to 

35
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:41,870
ignite the gunpowder.
This feels amazing.

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,830
It is as big a piece.
Can you get that?

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,960
That's a great question.
Depending on the size of the conch on 

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:49,960
beech trees,
they're much bigger than birch.

39
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,450
These trees just naturally get larger.

40
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,180
So the larger,
the more fabric you can tear.

41
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,540
But this mushroom is made of mycelium 
and basically what that fabric is a 

42
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,810
cellular fabric called mycelium.
And this is,

43
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,960
I have,
actually,

44
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:05,930
I have one that caught on fire because 
someone was smoking a joint near me.

45
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:11,050
And uh,
the and the embers of the joint got on 

46
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:11,050
my hat to just immediately go up.
No,

47
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,530
it burns really slowly.
So it's a fuse.

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,080
It's fantastic for delayed explosions as
because you can light this thing and 

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,900
beekeepers for hundreds of years used 
this for smoking the hives of bees 

50
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,930
because it's um,
it's just,

51
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,520
we could,
we could light it now.

52
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:28,550
I mean the whole thing would,
one flick of the bic and this thing will

53
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,340
smoke entirely in about 10 minutes and 
turn nothing.

54
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,420
Nothing into white ash.
Wow.

55
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,310
Your fire alarms may go off though.
Yeah,

56
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,060
probably.
Yeah.

57
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,400
Also with this thing,
this larger piece,

58
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:42,740
they would hollow this out,
put an ember in there.

59
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:47,741
Would they have.
They'll have to blow on the ember as 

60
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:47,741
they hiked.
Well,

61
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:50,381
you could blow it on a little bit and 
you cap it and then you can put it in 

62
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:52,961
your pocket.
The famous iceman that was found on the 

63
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:53,690
border of view in Austria,
he had this tethered to his right side,

64
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:56,060
which is a position of significance.
You know,

65
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:58,220
things that you need,
like your knife,

66
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,250
you know,
and things you want to make sure you 

67
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,250
have if you're right handed you this on 
the right side.

68
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,321
So there's this one example.
We have a thread of knowledge of use of 

69
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:12,451
mushrooms that goes over millennia and 
most of those threads have been frayed 

70
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:16,111
or broken in the chain of knowledge,
but this is one of the threads that was 

71
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:17,740
not broken and it's significant.

72
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,740
I think it's we are much more dependent 
upon mushrooms when we were forest 

73
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,850
people than we are now seemingly in the 
cities,

74
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:27,460
but it's coming full circle very 
quickly.

75
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,430
Well,
mushrooms are weird in that some of them

76
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:35,431
are incredibly edible and nutritious and
other ones will kill you and sometimes 

77
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:36,940
they look really similar to each other.
Well,

78
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:41,710
this is the mystery of mushrooms and I 
think it speaks to also Michael Phobia,

79
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,940
the fear of mushrooms.
R Gordon Wasson first coined that term,

80
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:50,440
but when you think about it in your 
visual landscape with animals,

81
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,560
you see them for months,
years in plants,

82
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,920
so you have a familiarity factor,
but mushrooms that come up and 

83
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,340
disappeared for five days.
Some of them can feed you,

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,770
some can kill you,
some can heal you,

85
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,080
some can send to you on a spiritual 
journey.

86
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,410
So to have something so powerful and yet
so ephemeral,

87
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,460
it's natural for humans to avoid that 
which they don't understand out of fear 

88
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,430
because they don't know the difference.

89
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,330
But you know,
23 primates consume mushrooms,

90
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,630
humans being one of them,
and so that speaks to a long ancestral 

91
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,111
use of mushrooms going back in our 
primate evolutionary tree for a very,

92
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:29,980
very long time.
What,

93
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:33,430
how many species of mushrooms are there?
You know that you asked,

94
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,800
you asked me that question five years 
ago,

95
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,220
I would've said one point $5 million and
now we're up to about $5.

96
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:44,221
Million is being is being estimated.
Plant fungi outnumber plants five to 10 

97
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:49,741
to one,
and I just speak at Ted and I've gone to

98
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:55,471
these ted conferences,
but it's shocking with the smartest 

99
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:57,460
brains in the world.
Not until just recently did they realize

100
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,740
what us mycologists have known for a 
long time.

101
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,780
Thirty percent of the soil mass when 
you're walking on soil,

102
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,260
the 30 percent of the biological carbon 
is fungal.

103
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,050
And the biggest,
biggest whoa,

104
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:11,700
whoa,
whoa.

105
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,720
Say that again.
Thirty percent.

106
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:18,430
Thirty percent of soil is fungal mass 
living and dead of healthy soil,

107
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,180
so and this is the biggest repository of
carbon in the world in the ground is 

108
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,060
related to these fungal networks.
So there is about eight point three to 

109
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,710
about 10 million species on the planet 
about right now,

110
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:37,711
about half of those are fungal species.
They outnumber plants up to eight to 

111
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:39,370
1:10
to one by by some estimates,

112
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,850
a really nice,
interesting metric in one meter of a 

113
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,590
tree root for every meter of a tree 
root.

114
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,160
There's a kilometer of Mycelium,
I think of that three feet versus 2100 

115
00:05:55,691 --> 00:06:00,691
feet so that the extensiveness of the 
mycelial network in our landscapes is 

116
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,370
vast and it's.
It's a,

117
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,710
as I call it,
Earth's natural internet as it is.

118
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,220
These are membranes that are literally 
sensitive.

119
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,370
I think they're sentient.
They respond to every footprint that we 

120
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:15,370
take on this planet.

121
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,830
And as you walk across landscapes,
you're breaking wood and that makes new 

122
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:24,140
nutrition available.
So the competition of fungi to find that

123
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:26,120
new new nutritionist,
fierce.

124
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,690
And so first to the menu winds.
So this is something that we are now 

125
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:37,421
understanding how essential they are for
preserving biodiversity and for the 

126
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:39,590
health of the ecosystems as well as our 
own personal health.

127
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,570
So when you say you think they're 
sentient,

128
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,420
to what degree?
I mean and you're not talking about just

129
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:49,421
like silicide and your Mascara.
We're kind of intellectually provincial 

130
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,330
in that we are using language and we've 
ended terms in order to describe 

131
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,450
concepts that we're trying to.
We're struggling with.

132
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,720
So the.
Let me describe it this way,

133
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:03,800
that we separated from fungi $650 
million years ago.

134
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,620
Maybe you did.
Dude.

135
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,290
I know some people that are probably 
still will.

136
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,650
Basically we,
we,

137
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,680
we are descendants of fungi.

138
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,640
We share a more common ancestry with 
fungi than we do with any of their 

139
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,880
kingdom and fungi are closer to animals 
and the plants.

140
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,100
Animals came from fungi.
You and I are actually fungal bodies.

141
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,330
I'm speaking to basically another fungal
body right now.

142
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,180
So Joe Rogan,
I mean whether you know it or not,

143
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,540
you are basically a fungal mass from a 
cellular point of view under the 

144
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,060
microscope.
A human cells,

145
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,920
animal cells.
And Fungal cells are very,

146
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:42,410
very similar.
We exhale carbon dioxide,

147
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,260
inhale oxygen,
as do fungus.

148
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,570
The fungus does.
We separated from fungi.

149
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:52,571
Basically,
we chose the route to encapsulate our 

150
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:54,431
nutrients in a cellular Osaka stomach,
digesting our nutrients within the 

151
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:56,930
fungal systems,
digest their nutrients externally.

152
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,440
They exhale oxygen,
inhale carbon dioxide and their network 

153
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,300
like design allows them to respond to 
catastrophic.

154
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,610
And what I mean by that is that the 
mycelial networks,

155
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,040
they're so dense in the soil and they 
have literally hundreds of billions of 

156
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,130
tips.

157
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,610
And as these tips are growing out,
they tend to be polynucleotide at the 

158
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:29,030
tips and it allows them to upregulate 
new enzymes,

159
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:30,450
acid sequences,
et cetera.

160
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:32,120
So if there's a new ecological 
challenge,

161
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,490
new food source,
a new toxin or something,

162
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:40,090
these fungal networks are so a great 
plasticity in being able to code for new

163
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:46,541
sequences from their DNA.
So all you need is one of those hundreds

164
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,360
of billions of tips to find a new enzyme
to break down a toxin or a new food 

165
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,481
source.
And what happens then is that 

166
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:57,851
information then is incorporated 
genetically into the mycelial network 

167
00:08:57,851 --> 00:09:02,010
and the mycelium then surges because as 
new food logically and so when it surges

168
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:05,190
named creates a new what's called a 
sector of Mycelium,

169
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:10,490
we now know there's evidence that the 
mycelial network then that benefits from

170
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:15,861
that tip exploration and discovery.
So these are like massively resilient,

171
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,240
adaptive organisms that have a network 
based design,

172
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,850
not dissimilar from that of our neural 
networks,

173
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,880
not dissimilar from the computer 
internet and more and more that I 

174
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,960
explore this,
the more I'm convinced that we will find

175
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,240
network based organisms throughout the 
cosmos,

176
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,750
probably fungal systems and fungal 
systems ultimately give rise,

177
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:44,031
in our case animals and it's more likely
we'll find fungal animal relationships 

178
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:44,490
all throughout the universe.

179
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,220
Do you think

180
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:50,330
that there's some unknown way that 
animals are connected in some sort of a 

181
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,540
similar way as well,
that if,

182
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,680
if animals came from fungus and fungus 
has this incredible way of communicating

183
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,470
with each other,
do you think that there's something like

184
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:01,870
that with the animal kingdom that we 
haven't discovered?

185
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Well,
that stimulates my thought into talking 

186
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:11,930
about the microbiome,
the mycelial landscapes,

187
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,720
networks,
they don't live by themselves.

188
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:19,721
They select a microbiome of bacteria and
other organisms that rest upon the 

189
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:21,620
mantle.
These fungal networks are the foundation

190
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,420
of the food web.
Well,

191
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,810
similarly,
we have a microbiome and it's really 

192
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,981
interesting that the many of the 
bacterial diseases that infect fungi 

193
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:36,910
also affect us.
Our best antibiotics against bacteria 

194
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,270
come from fungi.
Penicillin being the obvious example,

195
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,690
but we have found out during sex next 
gen sequencing,

196
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:43,280
and this has never been published 
before,

197
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:48,670
that the mycelial mats growing in the 
very same wood chips in our case that 

198
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:54,530
we'd been fermented.
We had a thousand fold difference in the

199
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:58,490
relative abundance of Genera of bacteria
from the very same wood chips.

200
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,580
Two different mushroom species planted 
on these wood chips and the microbiomes 

201
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,810
that were created and selected for by 
the mycelium were vastly different.

202
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,110
This really strongly supports the 
concept is the hypothesis with quickly 

203
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,220
becoming a theory.
I'll explain the difference in a minute,

204
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,840
but this really supports the concept 
that I've long believed that a spouse,

205
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,930
that these mycelial networks are there,
not just happenstance,

206
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,230
they are just creating the habitats and 
the flora and then ultimately the fauna 

207
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,480
that are resident within the ecosystem 
to guarantee the plurality and the 

208
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,750
biodiversity of the ecosystem by 
creating the plants that create,

209
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:37,460
that grow up,
that feed the animals,

210
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:42,461
the insects to create the debris fields 
and then feed the mycelium for the 

211
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:42,710
benefit of the progeny of the mushrooms 
out form thereafter.

212
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,950
So these are deterministic organisms 
that are setting the stage for 

213
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,800
ecological evolution.
And you think that they're doing this in

214
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:50,810
a conscious manner.
Well,

215
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,980
see again,
we're victims of our consciousness 

216
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,440
trying to define what is conscious and 
what a smart and one of the best 

217
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,710
arguments I've had,
my brother builds a super genius,

218
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:03,460
is far smarter than myself and he was 
editing one of my books,

219
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:05,840
mycelium running how mushrooms can help 
save the world.

220
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:07,360
And and he goes,
Paul,

221
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:12,361
you cannot say that mycelium is 
intelligent and that you can't say 

222
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:13,750
nature is intelligent.
I go,

223
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,190
wait,
Bill,

224
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,280
I respect you,
but you didn't realize that how poc of 

225
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,481
the statement that you're giving me,
you're telling me nature is not 

226
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:23,481
intelligent and yet you are born of 
nature.

227
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:28,471
Using the mind to conceive the concept 
that challenge the idea that nature is 

228
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:28,690
not intelligent when you are part of 
nature.

229
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,870
I rest my case.
Yeah,

230
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,190
that's,
that's indefensible.

231
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:34,690
So yeah,
so we're.

232
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,300
We create language and words to describe
concepts.

233
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,340
So you feel like your brother was sort 
of hampered by these predetermined 

234
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,020
categories that we like to put things 
into it.

235
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,840
You have a word,
use that word.

236
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:47,050
The word is very clearly defined in our.

237
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,460
Thank you.
Thank you.

238
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:52,930
Yes.
Language is code and we don't have.

239
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,170
We haven't elaborated the code yet to 
elucidate the concepts that we're trying

240
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:59,200
to articulate.
That does not mean that just because you

241
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:01,240
can't prove it's true doesn't mean it 
hasn't happened.

242
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,840
So as our vocabulary increases,
you know,

243
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,210
as our lexicon of language increases of 
more robust than I think we can better,

244
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,220
better describe,
test and prove that these concepts are 

245
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,280
true,
but we are biologically provincial.

246
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,970
When we think about how limited we are,
we're truly neanderthals with nuclear 

247
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,900
weapons.
I mean this is when you look at the how,

248
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,670
how important natural ecosystems are,
try to replicate them.

249
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,040
They're very,
very difficult to replicate due to their

250
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:35,041
complexity,
so I think the more that we study 

251
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,351
nature,
most all of us scientists subscribe to 

252
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:38,530
the adage that the more we studied the 
subject,

253
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:43,590
the more we realized we didn't know and 
the Hubris of us thinking that these 

254
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,580
things cannot occur,
did not occur,

255
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:49,690
will not occur,
really speaks to our provincial attitude

256
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:50,290
towards nature.

257
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,060
The idea that these fungus fungi are 
creating their environment and almost 

258
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,990
they're the architects of this 
environment.

259
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:06,310
They're establishing the landscape for 
all these different creatures and 

260
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,890
lifeforms to live is unbelievably 
fascinating.

261
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,310
The idea that and also that they're 
connected,

262
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,260
right?
They're connected in some sort of almost

263
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:18,261
like a neural network and there's,
what is that thing in the Pacific 

264
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:22,731
northwest,
the one fungus group that's essentially 

265
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:23,160
the largest living organism on the face 
of the earth.

266
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,510
Yeah.
The largest organism in the world so far

267
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,630
discovered is a mycelial mat.
Twenty 200 acres in size and that's 

268
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,070
equivalent to about 665 football fields.
That's one animal is one man,

269
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,330
one mycelial mat.
It's a honey mushroom that kills trees.

270
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,000
It's an edible mushroom,
but think of this.

271
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,850
Let me think.
So for those listeners out there,

272
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,910
if any soil biologist know this well,
if you go out and get some nice rich 

273
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,370
soil,
a of it and you analyze,

274
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:57,371
it typically is a million 5 million 
microbes per gram in that soil.

275
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Now the mycelium is growing out.
We have five or six skin layers that 

276
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,871
protect us from infection.
The mycelium only has one cell wall on 

277
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:11,951
the other side of that cell wall are 
hundreds of millions of microbes per 

278
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:14,771
gram that are trying to consume it.
Many of which the mycelium is able to 

279
00:15:14,771 --> 00:15:19,090
upregulate and constant biomolecular 
communication with this ecosystem be 

280
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,350
able to prevent predators from consuming
it,

281
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,890
thus allowing it to achieve the largest 
mass of any organism in the world.

282
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,340
This is amazing to me because it means 
that it is constantly in communication 

283
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:36,041
with the ecosystem being challenged,
accepting alliances,

284
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:41,081
so guilds of microbiomes are being 
created selected by the mycelium and 

285
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:46,160
these guilds and communities then 
cooperate in order to prevent pathogens,

286
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:51,161
parasites,
even competing guilds from coming into 

287
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:53,561
that landscape.
So the dominance of these fungi are to 

288
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:54,320
ensure the ecosystems give lives to 
their progeny.

289
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,230
The rule of natural selection of life is
reproduction,

290
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,990
so everything steers towards 
reproduction.

291
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,210
So from evolutionary biology point of 
view,

292
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:07,211
what will that organism do to help 
survive so he can reproduce and 

293
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,330
reproduction through creating guilds of 
communities of the microbiome using the 

294
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,291
mycelial network as the structural 
foundation of the food web seems to be 

295
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,460
the name of the game here.
So this honey mushroom,

296
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:21,980
is that what it's called?
And that lives in the Pacific northwest.

297
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,160
It.

298
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,100
How is it killing these trees is a root 
parasite,

299
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:30,340
so it comes in and kills the trees and I
spent a lot of time in the old growth 

300
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,721
forest and a lot of hiking.
I've always been one wondering about 

301
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:37,720
meadows and the sub Alpine regions.
There's all these subalpine forests and 

302
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:39,890
then you come out and it is giant 
meadows.

303
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,180
I suspect that the honey mushroom is a 
meadow maker.

304
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,810
It climaxes these trees.
It kills them.

305
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,470
They then die and then they grow out 
prophetically,

306
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,290
but then it clears the canopy for the 
grasses landscape,

307
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,500
sap prophetic music.
It's growing on dead material,

308
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,220
so first is a parasite mushrooms,
the mushrooms,

309
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,600
the persons.
The parasite kills the tree.

310
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,290
That's a sacrifice or sap probe as 
another word for it.

311
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,620
It's a decomposer.
It breaks down that material,

312
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,480
but as it decomposes the wood,
30 percent of wood becomes water,

313
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,900
so the mycelium generates water,
so water lenses are being created that 

314
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,140
now you have more sunlight.

315
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,230
Grasses then flourish,
and so I suspected that these mushrooms 

316
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,041
are actually meadow makers allowing then
the elk and the deer and marmots and 

317
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:34,850
whatnot to exist in those grassland 
environments as a way of rebuilding the 

318
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,831
nitrogen sources in the soil.
So I think these are over great huge 

319
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:46,361
time scales.
We have to get away from the concept of 

320
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:46,361
our lifespan or even 100,
200 years.

321
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:49,410
We need to think in millennial terms 
over many,

322
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,680
many millennia.
This is unbelievably fascinating.

323
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,300
The idea that they're sort of the 
architects of their ecosystem.

324
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,580
They are the architects of our 
existence.

325
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,150
This is something that there's a really 
fantastic research that's come out in 

326
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,540
the past two years.
I'm.

327
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,690
I'm a science ambassador,
flared AAA's,

328
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,770
the American Association of Science,
so I am a little bit out there,

329
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:18,771
but I'm really happy that I have so much
scientific support these days because a 

330
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:19,080
lot of the things I've been talking 
about for 20 years now,

331
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,670
well rooted and been proven.

332
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,360
One of the things that that has been so 
fascinating to me,

333
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,640
and I'm still wrapping my mind around 
this,

334
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,090
but you know,
the universe was created about 13 point 

335
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,961
8 billion years ago from the Big Bang.
The earth coalesced out of star at us 

336
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:40,101
about four point 5 billion.
The earliest records of life we have is 

337
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:43,680
about three point 8 billion years ago.
Single cell,

338
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,700
single celled organisms,
but just recently in lava beds in South 

339
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,650
Africa,
they found mycelium infused to the lava.

340
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,350
Two point 4 billion years ago now,
we split from fungi,

341
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:02,430
650 million years ago,
and then in Brazil this past year,

342
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:07,431
they found a fully intact,
apparently a fossilized mushroom 

343
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:11,240
published in nature,
which is a very reputable scientific 

344
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,081
journal,
and that one is one point 4 billion 

345
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:15,930
years old.
So the oldest,

346
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:20,931
multicellular organism in the fossil 
record today is this fungus in lava in 

347
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:24,060
South Africa.
Two point 4 billion years ago,

348
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:28,500
a fully formed mushroom who had this 
form grew,

349
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,700
was growing.

350
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,550
One point 4 billion years ago,
we were.

351
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,220
We separated from fungi.
Six hundred 50 million years ago.

352
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:40,221
Mushrooms had their form longer than 
we've had our form by more than a 

353
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,881
billion years here.
Jamie just pulled it up on the screen 

354
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:43,881
here so we can take a look at it.
One from Brazil.

355
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:47,940
So this is the pause.
This though,

356
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:52,941
the image that you're familiar with,
the one that has just been published in 

357
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:57,471
the past,
they have a great name that's a tongue 

358
00:19:57,471 --> 00:19:59,640
twister to pronounce this Gondwana.
Garris ids magnificence.

359
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,430
Why did they do that?
They do that to make people like me feel

360
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:07,431
stupid.
They don't have to graduate students 

361
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:07,860
want to publish papers and said they get
invent names,

362
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,640
so it looks better if you have a long 
Latin sounding name,

363
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,690
so,
but think of that.

364
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:15,030
Mushrooms had their form before we had 
ours.

365
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,020
These are elders,
these are ancient organisms.

366
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:24,290
These are the really the the overlord 
under lords of our ecosystem and I 

367
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,210
suspect and as these neural networks,
they have more neural connections in the

368
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:30,240
mycelial mass over a thousand acres and 
we have in our brain,

369
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,090
they are actually accumulating 
knowledge,

370
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:36,480
genetic intelligence,
but I think that as time goes on,

371
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,680
I hope that we have to interface with 
them because I think there is a.

372
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,010
There are many benefits of us 
communicating with mycelium that can 

373
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:50,500
give us rapid responses to kind of 
Straw.

374
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,730
That's how they've evolved and we're now
the biggest walking catastrophe that I 

375
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,761
know walking across the planet and we 
need to engage these fungal allies for 

376
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:04,171
the benefits that we need to put it into
play in order to prevent the loss of 

377
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:04,450
biodiversity.

378
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:09,590
It seems like a communication gap would 
be very hard to bridge that 

379
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,170
communication gap.
I mean,

380
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:15,171
if we really did find a way to 
communicate in some form with mushrooms,

381
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,360
like the concept of language,
like you were talking about,

382
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:22,290
just the idea of nature and intelligence
and these words that we have,

383
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:27,291
that we have these sort of concrete 
definitions in our head that don't 

384
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,310
really apply to some things that are 
very,

385
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,030
very confusing to us.
Like the idea of fungal intelligence,

386
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,360
the idea that you could somehow or 
another understand the language that 

387
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,700
these things we want.
We don't even understand dolphin 

388
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:43,700
language.

389
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,320
Well,
one classic example,

390
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,770
example,
the Japanese are so clever at this.

391
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:52,771
They,
there was a slime mold called Pfizer 

392
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:56,980
polycephalum and they had a.
and this slime mold is very,

393
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:59,560
very good at navigating through mazes 
and challenges.

394
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,860
I mean,
first to food wins is conservation of 

395
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,680
energy as rewarded.
So you don't want to set this up.

396
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,680
They like it.
They did several experiments.

397
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,700
Fun.
Most fun.

398
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:14,701
One is they,
they designed a nutrient basically 

399
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:19,560
nutrient like maze replicating,
um,

400
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Tokyo and the Japanese subway system.
And so they started with Tokyo and they 

401
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:28,300
put oats,
which is a nutritional source.

402
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:33,301
They inoculated what is on this basic 
and aggre map with all the major cities,

403
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,900
the nodes around Tokyo,
and they then make each of those nodes 

404
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,000
had a piece of oat on them was a source 
of nutrition.

405
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,300
The main oat was where Tokyo was.
They inoculated it and then they let the

406
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:54,541
slime mold then grow,
and first it grew out randomly 

407
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,710
exploratory Lee,
just like you would do if you're a 

408
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,870
hunter or something or hunting on the 
landscape,

409
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:03,370
looking for things,
and then after about 28 hours,

410
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,640
it reorganized itself in the most 
efficient way possible and reorganized 

411
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:14,821
the Japanese subway system in a more 
efficient manner than it's designed 

412
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:14,821
today.

413
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,050
Thus they said,
not me,

414
00:23:17,051 --> 00:23:22,051
not Paul stamets.
This is a demonstration of cellular 

415
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:25,021
intelligence.
So this is the tip of the proverbial 

416
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:25,021
mycelial iceberg.
You know,

417
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:30,030
this is,
it has broad implications and I just 

418
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,541
want people to suspend their disbelief 
and this goes into it actually,

419
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:39,211
the evolution of human consciousness and
Terence Mckenna was a good friend of 

420
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,150
mine.
I love Terence.

421
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,240
I especially love the last five years of
his life because he made fun of himself 

422
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,511
so much.
Terence people took terence way too 

423
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,120
seriously in many levels,
but as his brother Dennis,

424
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,460
which I think has been on your show a 
couple times.

425
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:55,010
Yeah,
this is a great ally,

426
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:56,570
great scientists,
but you know,

427
00:23:56,571 --> 00:24:01,571
Dennis said even if 10 percent of what 
terence said was true is frigging 

428
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:05,920
amazing and terence and Dennis both came
up with a stain stoned ape theory.

429
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,090
Now it's not a theory,
it's a hypothesis.

430
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:13,510
A hypothesis is speculative,
but cannot necessarily be as not yet 

431
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,561
proven.
A theory is a hypothesis that has been 

432
00:24:17,561 --> 00:24:20,621
tested and proven with facts,
so I disagree with them and saying it's 

433
00:24:20,621 --> 00:24:20,621
not a theory,
it's a hypothesis,

434
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,920
but the hypothesis of the stone,
a part of the stoned ape,

435
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:29,921
which I think you've alluded to before,
is that with climate change and as the 

436
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:33,971
savannas increased and our primate 
ancestors came out of the forest 

437
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:38,231
canopies,
there are tracking across the Savanna 

438
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:38,231
and if you're a hunter,
what do you look?

439
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:39,240
You look for footsteps.
I mean,

440
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:44,241
look for Scott and the most significant 
fleshy mushroom going out of poop in 

441
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,290
Africa,
hippopotamus,

442
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,600
elephant,
deer,

443
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:51,660
antelope,
et cetera.

444
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,910
His last big events,
this is a very large mushroom.

445
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,010
You're hungry,
you're with your clan,

446
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:03,670
you consume it,
and then 20 minutes later you are 

447
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,170
catapulted in this extraordinary 
experience.

448
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,380
Psilocybin substitutes,
as serotonin becomes a better 

449
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,410
neurotransmitter,
activates neurogenesis,

450
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,890
it causes new neurons to form new 
pathways of knowledge.

451
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,220
So that's the stoned ape hypothesis,
and it speaks to a mystery that the 

452
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:27,071
human brain,
basically the brain cavity doubled in 

453
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:31,181
size in about 2 million years.
Some people say as less as to less than 

454
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:32,600
200,000,
Homo sapiens run 200,000

455
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:34,940
years.
Homo sapiens arrived at 200,000

456
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:35,900
to 300,000
years ago.

457
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,970
It's a big gap.
It's a big gamble,

458
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:42,971
but science is like that.
So you want to be scientifically 

459
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:42,971
accurate.
Here,

460
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:46,220
I need to show the extreme margins of 
what's been estimated,

461
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:51,650
so we accept 2 million years that the 
innocent shown in the fossil record.

462
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:56,651
This is true,
the oldest homo sapiens fossils are 

463
00:25:56,651 --> 00:25:56,651
300,000
years old now,

464
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,800
but we have a subtle suddenly doubling 
of the human brain.

465
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,760
And with that,
our language centers increased our 

466
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,280
ability to prognosticate,
to plan,

467
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,290
and there's no explanation for this 
currently.

468
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,010
And even though we may not be able to 
prove it,

469
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,550
I ask people to suspend their disbelief 
for a second.

470
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,050
Now,
think of this.

471
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,950
Our primate ancestors are going across 
the Savanna,

472
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,250
the injustice mushrooms as a clan,
massive input for anyone's eaten.

473
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:33,530
These mushrooms,
huge amounts of data's coming in,

474
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,310
fractal patterns.
Geometrical landscapes occur.

475
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,350
You have empathy,
you have greater courage.

476
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,890
You're fighting a saber,
save a saber,

477
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:44,970
tooth tiger,
you know,

478
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:49,971
one day you have a fear of it.
We know now from neurogenesis and the 

479
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:52,350
extinction of the fear response that has
been clinically proven.

480
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,650
PSILOCYBIN allows you to re set and have
different neurological pathways to 

481
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,840
respond to fear,
overcoming the fear,

482
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,860
conditioned response,
potentially ptsd.

483
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,710
And there's a lot of research on this 
currently so,

484
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:07,620
but this one happened one time with one 
hominid group.

485
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,470
Wouldn't happen two times,
10 times it happened,

486
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,560
millions and millions and millions and 
millions of times over millions and 

487
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:17,460
millions of years.

488
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:22,670
This leads to what I think is called,
should be called epigenetic 

489
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,850
neurogenesis.
We know that there was a regeneration of

490
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:28,851
neurons.
We know that psilocybin substitutes as 

491
00:27:28,851 --> 00:27:29,030
Serotonin,
it opens the floodgates of the senses.

492
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:34,050
You have a lot more data coming in and 
we know that he has extinction of the 

493
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,670
fear response,
so if you're the leader of your clan,

494
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,970
you've had this traumatic event,
either war or cataclysm from 

495
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,840
earthquakes,
whatever the case may be,

496
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:44,760
or encounter a saber,
tooth tiger,

497
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:49,790
whatever.
If you're the leader of that clan and 

498
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:53,040
you can overcome your fear response,
you have courage and you have empathy.

499
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,840
Those are leadership skills.
I think we'd be able to take note of it.

500
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:03,770
People like to fall leaders who are 
courageous and yet kind who they can 

501
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:08,541
trust,
they'll have their best interests in 

502
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:08,541
mind.
So I think this propelled,

503
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,440
I think as a lot is a very good 
explanation.

504
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,440
It's an unprovable hypothesis,
but now we're at a junction for the net 

505
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,180
and we're ready for the next quantum 
leap in human consciousness.

506
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,660
I think psilocybin should be looked upon
as a nootropic vitamin and there's a 

507
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,010
huge amount of interest in this.
Johns Hopkins University,

508
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:28,380
as you probably well know,
New York University,

509
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:30,420
Ucla,
elsewhere in Europe,

510
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,600
there's major clinical studies that have
been conducted in the past two years 

511
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,950
showing exactly what I'm saying about 
overcoming fear response,

512
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,860
neurogenesis,
overcoming ptsd.

513
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,220
This is now medically quite seriously 
considered and something that I think 

514
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:49,650
that we should explore under controlled 
settings.

515
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:52,290
I'm not into partying with psilocybin 
mushrooms,

516
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,930
so good.
I can understand that fear is going to 

517
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:03,970
be here in an hour and a half and he's 
the creator of shroom fest.

518
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,990
He's going to be very upset with your 
idea that you shouldn't party with it.

519
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,710
Well,
I think there's greater benefit and 

520
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:12,810
humanity.

521
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:16,230
I think these are serious tools.
California has it.

522
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,280
I'm sure you probably aware.
Wow.

523
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,780
There it's up for legalization.
Yeah.

524
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:25,720
I was really quite surprised by that.
Yeah.

525
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,710
All my work and to put some caveats 
here,

526
00:29:27,711 --> 00:29:32,711
I was.
All my work is covered by a drug 

527
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:34,371
enforcement administration license.
I've published now four new species in 

528
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:37,761
the genus philosophy,
including the most potent psilocybin 

529
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:37,761
mushroom in the world called philosophy 
as residents,

530
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,210
and to be clear,
folks,

531
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,500
nature provides.
I don't,

532
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:45,810
so I had my dea license,
I mean everyone I suspected was a dea 

533
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:50,041
agent who came to me and wanted to get 
some psilocybin but probably got set up 

534
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:52,650
a bunch of times,
numerous times at all.

535
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,740
It was,
it,

536
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,600
was it a point.
It was pretty funny.

537
00:29:55,601 --> 00:30:00,601
You know,
I had this one person that offered me 

538
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:00,670
just huge amounts of money and I played 
with them and I said,

539
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:01,450
no,
it's not enough.

540
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,030
And he offered me more and more money 
presented with 200,

541
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:09,031
$300,000
and he and he was writing all these 

542
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:12,390
coded letters.
Really obviously a dea agent trying to 

543
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,751
set me up and finally got really 
frustrated because I was playing with a 

544
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:15,751
guy.
I said,

545
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:16,270
you know,
I'm tired of being set up like this.

546
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:17,660
I'm just gonna play with a Sucker,
you know?

547
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,360
And so it finally came to a point and 
you've got really,

548
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:23,740
really frustrated.
You don't get mad at me.

549
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:24,120
He goes,
well,

550
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:29,130
how much money I go,
there's not enough money on this planet 

551
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,370
for me to ever give you a soulless Ivan 
mushroom.

552
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:32,500
So give it up.
So.

553
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,100
But if you say that's not enough money,
could that be taken as a negotiation?

554
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,540
Well,
not enough money on the planet.

555
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,610
I suppose.
Some aliens,

556
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,040
not enough money on the planet for not 
enough money.

557
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,290
It was not enough money.
Right before that goes,

558
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:52,420
is telling you that like if you had like
a really loosely interpreting judge you 

559
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,580
I suppose.
But I never committed a criminal act.

560
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,720
So isn't it sort of like a conspiracy 
to.

561
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,430
I'm not a lawyer.
I wouldn't have.

562
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:05,350
I mean you have to keep things in 
context.

563
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,950
I wouldn't play.
Maybe you're more courageous person when

564
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:13,951
it comes to that stuff than me.
Well at some point I just got frankly 

565
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:15,550
pissed off and I'm playing with waste of
your time.

566
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:17,520
I'm going to play with you and I'm going
to reverse the tables.

567
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:18,550
So.
But in any event,

568
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,810
this is serious research and it's 
something that unfortunately,

569
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,080
because it can be marginalized by the 
party atmosphere and used as a party 

570
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,220
drug.
There's a really amazing study that just

571
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:35,221
came out about five days ago.
It's a big data study.

572
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Four hundred and 40,000
people.

573
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:46,470
Prisoners were surveyed over 10 years 
and the Department of Human and health 

574
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,211
services data bank,
and they found an amazing correlation if

575
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:54,100
you had in this patient and this 
prisoners,

576
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,700
one experience with psilocybin in your 
life,

577
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:03,150
one experience it reduced in that 
population compared to the people who 

578
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:08,641
did not take psilocybin mushrooms,
an 18 percent reduction in burglary and 

579
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:14,611
larceny and up to a 27 percent reduction
in other crimes including violent 

580
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:17,620
crimes,
so that phenomenal.

581
00:32:17,621 --> 00:32:20,830
I actually got my numbers reversed,
is 27 percent reduction in burglary.

582
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,140
Eighteen percent reduction in violent 
crime.

583
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:28,350
Now,
think of the damage not only to the 

584
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,110
victims and the victims' families,
the court system,

585
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:30,910
the lawyers,
the collateral damage,

586
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,940
people being upset because they were 
being criminalized in prison for 

587
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,111
something you know,
for merely possessing psilocybin 

588
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:41,840
mushrooms or something like that.
But think of the return on investment of

589
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:46,841
four to six hour experience creates a 
lifetime benefit to society.

590
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,130
Reducing criminal activity by 18 to 27 
percent.

591
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:58,660
This is phenomenal.
This is that this is something that can 

592
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,140
help the health of our,
of our human psyche,

593
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:02,120
our of our,
of our social system,

594
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,990
of reducing trauma throughout our entire
society.

595
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:11,410
It's time for us to wake up and look at 
this at a much more seasoned and 

596
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,620
intellectual fashion than we have a 
rational

597
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,900
not weighed down by the ideas of 
mushrooms being a silly thing

598
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,380
and so I mean I have a few pet peeves 
and I understand why people want to use,

599
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,960
but the word shroom just drives me 
crazy.

600
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:33,020
Shroom,
fast strand this room fastest with all 

601
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,420
due respect.
I understand,

602
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,660
but let's not be children about this.
Let's be adults.

603
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,490
You know,
you're a serious person.

604
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,340
I get it.
I,

605
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,420
I'm also in a non serious person on many
levels,

606
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:47,421
but I know when it comes to something 
that is so powerful that is so 

607
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:51,051
important,
let's not jeopardize its use medically 

608
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:55,131
and the benefit society in the future by
appealing to the lowest common 

609
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:56,460
denominator.
Let's be adults in the room on this.

610
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,540
I agree with you to a certain extent,
but I also think that it's got to be 

611
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,651
incredibly frustrating for a guy like 
you that has the kind of information 

612
00:34:05,651 --> 00:34:08,651
that you have bouncing around your head 
in relationship to the rest of the 

613
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:08,651
world.
Views it.

614
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:12,170
See to a person like myself who I don't 
know nearly as much as you know,

615
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:17,171
but I know quite a bit more than the 
average person when it comes to 

616
00:34:17,171 --> 00:34:19,190
psilocybin and mushrooms or Amanita 
[inaudible] or Terence Mckenna's ideas.

617
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:24,970
Shroom fest doesn't bother me,
but for a serious researcher like 

618
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:24,970
yourself,
it's got to be like,

619
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,870
oh,
you're a part of the problem.

620
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,660
Right?
Well,

621
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,740
it's naked.
It's silly.

622
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,630
Is that Timothy leary problem,
right?

623
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,050
Right.

624
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,370
It held back the bonafide research in 
this subject for years.

625
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,560
There's a movement right now in that,
please.

626
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,660
It is.
There's a movement right now to move 

627
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:41,660
psilocybin from schedule one to schedule
two,

628
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,670
schedule one illegal drug that has no 
medical benefits.

629
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,430
Schedule two means it's a drug that has 
medical benefits,

630
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:51,820
so there's a serious movement going on 
right now within the FDA to have it be 

631
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:57,731
recategorized because in the words of 
FDA researchers,

632
00:34:57,741 --> 00:35:02,741
I know one arm's length removed is that 
they've never seen anything with such a 

633
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:07,031
strong safety profile.
They give so much benefit at so little 

634
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:10,361
cost for such a long time.
This is a drug in a category of its own.

635
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,980
This is really important.
Let's not jeopardize it.

636
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,540
It is really important,
but you're never going to stop kids from

637
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:21,560
calling a truce.
Well,

638
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,230
you know,
and I want to give a pass here.

639
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,510
I want to get a pass and the coming of 
age,

640
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:31,100
you know,
when I was 16 to the age 20 to 24,

641
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,280
it's the coming of age ceremony.
Now I'm going to tell you something 

642
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,071
that's very deeply personal and very 
significant in my life.

643
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,670
I had a congenital stuttering habit.
I could not speak.

644
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,450
I could not look at Joe Rogan in the eye
right now without,

645
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,480
you know,
I had like the king's speech.

646
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:54,780
You've seen the movie exactly like that,
but worse.

647
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:59,870
In my case,
I went through six years of speech 

648
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,470
therapy.
I was interviewed for special education.

649
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:03,510
I grew up in a small town called 
Columbiana,

650
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:08,511
Ohio and I could not speak now the type 
of stuttering habit that I have and had.

651
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:13,800
I don't stutter to animals.
I had pet snapping turtles and I haven't

652
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:16,540
talked to him all the time and I don't 
stutter when I sing,

653
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:22,190
but I could not elocute without 
stuttering constantly and please people 

654
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:24,930
out there don't finish a stutterers 
sentence.

655
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:30,540
The type of stutterer category that I 
have been in is that we would try to 

656
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:36,111
trick our brain with a prepositional or 
adverbial phrase halfway through the 

657
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:40,971
sentence that we're stuck on because 
we're thinking three or four sentences 

658
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:41,100
ahead and the only way you can do is 
trick the brain.

659
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:46,370
So I had to come up with a new 
neurological pathway to trick my brain 

660
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,010
so I could get out of my stuttering 
rhythm.

661
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,280
That was just repetition I couldn't get 
out of.

662
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,270
And then in one day before I ever had 
psilocybin mushrooms,

663
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,680
I bought some,
a bag of them and I thought I got,

664
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,370
I had no information,
I just bought the bag for about 25 bucks

665
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,700
and I went out for a walk in the woods 
in Ohio and there was a beautiful oak 

666
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:13,170
tree that I used to climb the top of the
very top of the tallest hill in Ohio.

667
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,740
We don't have mountains,
we have hills and it isn't a summertime.

668
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:18,990
And so I thought set and setting is 
important.

669
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:22,710
I knew that.
So I went for a walk and I ate the bag,

670
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,010
the whole bag when I was walking.
How many announcers you think?

671
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,090
Well,
it was about.

672
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:29,040
I know it was about a half an ounce to 
an ounce.

673
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,620
So.
So we're,

674
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,030
we're talking.
This is,

675
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:37,370
this is,
this is the elevator ride beyond the 

676
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,741
10th floor.
So eight to 16 grams is probably on the 

677
00:37:39,741 --> 00:37:40,120
order,
about 20 grand,

678
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,050
you know.
So.

679
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,270
And,
but I didn't know.

680
00:37:45,271 --> 00:37:46,080
No,
I had no one to.

681
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,780
So.
But I knew that I went to this.

682
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,520
I want to.
My destination was this tree.

683
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:56,270
So I walked and walked and I came at the
tree and I was eating the mushrooms and 

684
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:00,980
then I started feeling the effects and 
so it was great because I was climbing 

685
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,740
the tree and I was getting higher in the
tree and higher in my brain.

686
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,200
Well that seems like a terrible thing to
do.

687
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,680
And I climbed to the top of the tree and
this beautiful landscape.

688
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:09,750
But it was,
was the summertime,

689
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,850
these boiling black clouds in the 
horizon.

690
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:12,270
I go,
oh,

691
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,520
that's cool.
You know?

692
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,010
And so this big summer storm was coming.
The,

693
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:22,410
the clouds were dark and boiling and,
and they're coming close and I could 

694
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:26,841
hear the thunder and you know,
and then I'm going to higher and higher 

695
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:30,021
and the winds pick up and the tree 
started moving and I started getting 

696
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:30,021
vertigo because I was like,
oh my God,

697
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:31,740
I'm getting so freaking high on these 
mushrooms.

698
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:37,190
And so I grabbed the tree and held on 
the tree and it became my axis Mundi 

699
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,621
into the earth.
And then the lightning started coming 

700
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:40,621
closer and then lightning strikes 
started.

701
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:45,330
I'm really close and the lightning would
hit and I saw fractals for the first 

702
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,800
time the atmosphere became liquid.

703
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:53,010
I saw this liquid waves of these 
multidimensional geometrical patterns 

704
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,761
everywhere and the sparks of lightning 
would just create these amazing 

705
00:38:56,761 --> 00:39:00,391
crescendos of secondary,
tertiary fractals all around me and I 

706
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:01,100
was like,
oh my.

707
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,140
It was amazing.
I said,

708
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:07,141
this is what I read about.
So the storm came and lightning strikes 

709
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:11,851
are all around me and I was washed with 
rain ends up there and I felt I felt in 

710
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:12,880
touch with Gaia,
the universe.

711
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:16,000
My heart opened up.
I felt one with all.

712
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,380
I was like,
oh my gosh,

713
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:19,600
this is such a powerful spiritual 
experience.

714
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:22,930
I had no idea.
No matter what anyone has read,

715
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:25,630
as you probably know it cannot describe 
the experience,

716
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,910
and then it dawned on me,
wait a second,

717
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:32,911
stamets,
you're in the tallest tree on the 

718
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:33,250
tallest hill for miles in the middle of 
a lightning storm.

719
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:38,700
This is not the best place to be,
and so I realized I could be killed up 

720
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:39,190
here.

721
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,990
Suddenly I had a reality rush,
like you could turn into a god.

722
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,780
Imagine like Comic Book,
Twenty Grams of mushrooms,

723
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:54,990
hugging a tree,
the lightning comes and hits you and 

724
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,250
maybe you were the savior.
Maybe you need to get back to that tree.

725
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:03,510
Maybe you're the chosen one.
So I thought it was an incredibly 

726
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,830
spiritual and wonderful experience,
but I also had the fear,

727
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,170
and this comes,
comes with the hero's journey,

728
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,290
you know,
you always have the dark side.

729
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:17,900
He always have not just the light side,
but it's counterbalanced the dark side.

730
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,780
Then I realized,
oh my gosh,

731
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,580
I'm gonna.
I could die up here and said,

732
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,110
well,
I don't die stamets,

733
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,150
which were your issues?
This,

734
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,100
this gets something out of this 
experience.

735
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:32,101
And I said,
this stuttering habits ridiculous and 

736
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:34,570
I'm not stupid.
So I said to myself,

737
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:37,930
stop stuttering now.
Stop Stuttering now.

738
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,430
I said that dozens hundreds of times 
over and over and over,

739
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:47,431
and fortunately the storms went past and
held onto the tree and soaking wet.

740
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:52,980
I came out of the tree and walked back 
to where I was living in the next day I 

741
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,490
got up,
I didn't see anybody and I was walking 

742
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,681
on on on this path and sidewalk and 
there's a lady that I really liked a 

743
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:06,031
lot,
but she was always attracted to the 

744
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:06,100
super self assured jocks and things like
that.

745
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:11,101
She was actually very kind and sweet,
but I didn't want to stare at her in the

746
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:15,220
eyes because I would stutter and it's 
humiliating for us,

747
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,400
so the more humiliating us stutterers 
feel,

748
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,820
the more we stutter and so it's a really
slippery slope and so I would avoid eye 

749
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:28,700
contact and so for the first time she 
walked towards him,

750
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:29,680
he says,
Good Morning Paul,

751
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:34,681
how are you?
She was always so nice to me and I was 

752
00:41:34,681 --> 00:41:35,330
terrified because embarrass myself,
and I looked at her straight in the eyes

753
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,890
and I said,
I'm doing fine.

754
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,890
How are you?
And I stopped stuttering in one day and 

755
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:46,691
this speaks to now.
What has been medically proven is that 

756
00:41:46,691 --> 00:41:48,800
we can reset the neurology of the human 
brain through neurogenesis.

757
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:54,130
I believe that experience allowed me to 
map new neurological pathways that 

758
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,170
allows me to elocute in a way that I 
could not elocute before.

759
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,740
Now,
just to be truthful here,

760
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,860
if I drink a lot of alcohol,
I'm in a loud bar because us stutterers,

761
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:11,130
you're a martial artist.
I've been a martial artist all my life 

762
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,130
and we have peripheral consciousness and
so if someone comes through a door,

763
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,290
you know,
into the bar and I'm looking at you.

764
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:20,291
I know that they've come through,
so this hyper alertness that US martial 

765
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:24,431
artists have of knowing things in the 
circumference around us in the 

766
00:42:24,431 --> 00:42:28,421
peripheral environment is distracting.
So if I drink a lot and there's a loud,

767
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:31,700
a loud noise and a lot of people coming 
in and out of doors,

768
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:36,980
I'm hypersensitive to intruders and then
that's when I'll start stuttering.

769
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,710
If the person's talking to me asking me 
how do you grow mushrooms?

770
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:44,711
It's like filling a well with a teaspoon
because I'm worried about the guy who 

771
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:47,801
just came through the door over there 
who looks like he may not be a safe 

772
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:47,801
person to be in this environment right 
now.

773
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:53,140
So that there's a time that I'll,
you only give 10 percent of my brain to 

774
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:54,680
communicating to the person in front of 
me.

775
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:58,820
My 90 percent of my brain is hyper aware
in the circumstantial environment around

776
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:03,821
me,
time for another trip to the tree to 

777
00:43:03,821 --> 00:43:03,821
cure that last 10 percent.

778
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:09,610
But that's my personal story.
That's amazing and it's not going to 

779
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:09,800
work.
But it worked for you.

780
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:14,830
That's what's important for me.
And I was at crater lake lodge and a 

781
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:18,980
waiter came up to me and he goes,
he's about 17,

782
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:21,050
18 years of age,
a bus boy actually.

783
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,090
And my wife and I,
my wife looked at me and I looked,

784
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,630
looked at her and I said,
should I?

785
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,370
Yeah,
go ahead.

786
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,340
So I told her,
I told this bus boy at the same story.

787
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:36,341
Now this guy was totally straight,
looked like it was a super conservative 

788
00:43:36,341 --> 00:43:37,850
from a super conservative family.
And we told him this whole story and his

789
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:42,851
eyes were wide open because when you 
meet other stutterers and you talk to 

790
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:43,010
them,
they're really desperate for a solution.

791
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,920
So I never knew what happened to this 
young bus boy.

792
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:47,420
But I think I changed his life forever.

793
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:52,730
I hope you did.
So I had a good friend growing up and 

794
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,301
his brother was severely stricken with 
it to the point where he would have to 

795
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:59,080
wince,
close his eyes and looked down and he 

796
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,690
would talk to you and he just couldn't 
get over it.

797
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:02,810
It was.
But he won't stutter to animals.

798
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,310
It won't stutter when he sings.
So what do you think it is?

799
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,740
Like what is.
What is happening?

800
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,940
Do you think that?
Well,

801
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,960
there's several things.
It could be trauma when you're a child 

802
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,191
combined with neuropathy.
I was told by one psychiatrist who is a 

803
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:24,530
specialist in this at a conference that 
there is a theory that in the seventh or

804
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:27,980
eighth month in the womb,
you,

805
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,380
your neurons failed to make all the 
connections that it to.

806
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,740
So that makes sense to me because why 
would reroute with preposition 

807
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,531
preposition or adverbial phrases to try 
to jump around the little habitual loop 

808
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:40,240
that I'm in.

809
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:45,450
But I think this speaks to increasing 
intelligence and we all will suffer from

810
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:48,900
some form of dementia and neuropathy 
occurs.

811
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:54,830
There is a really wonderful,
safe and legal mushroom to use that at 

812
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,300
least in neurogenesis and that's called 
lion's mane.

813
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:02,400
And Lion's mane is a cascading white 
icicle edible choice mushroom.

814
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:05,070
They sell in the stores,
the stores,

815
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,290
grocery stores all over.
Yeah,

816
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,610
lion's Mane.
They're called,

817
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,800
um,
various brand names.

818
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:14,430
One I love is called pom Pom Blanc.
It looks like pom poms from cheerleaders

819
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:20,030
and lion's mane contains a unique group 
of compounds called rna scenes and 

820
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:26,700
herbicide nuns.
And these regenerate Myelin on the axons

821
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:31,730
of nerves.
And so this is a mushroom [inaudible] 

822
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,630
discovered this in 1994,
a Japanese researcher and he postulated 

823
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,381
it as a potential preventative or 
treatment for Alzheimer's,

824
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:41,640
muscular dystrophy,
etc.

825
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,660
But do take it.
I take it every day,

826
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,600
every day,
every day.

827
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:48,300
Take it in raw form or I take it in 
capsules.

828
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,490
So you Buy it?
Yeah,

829
00:45:50,491 --> 00:45:53,580
we have a,
we have an extensive product line.

830
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,710
How do you get to that host defense.com,
host defense.com.

831
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,040
Why host defense?
And that's part of your innate immunity 

832
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,050
response,
supporting your immunity.

833
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,300
But our main business is@fungi.com.
And I mentioned that many myself,

834
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:11,400
I'm kind of proud of that.
It cost me 25 bucks.

835
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,470
Nineteen 94.
Wow.

836
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:17,910
You were ahead of the ball so well 
yourself,

837
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:21,810
but lIon's mane is a safe mushroom to 
consume.

838
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:26,990
There are several clinical studies out 
on treating mild cognitive dysfunction,

839
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,850
but there's two mouse studies that I 
think are quite illustrative and this is

840
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:35,880
translational medicine.
This translates from mice experiments to

841
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:40,881
humans.
We already know is that it has aspects 

842
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,020
of neurogenesis.
When you go into all zimmer,

843
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:45,210
a state of alzheimer's,
which is a bit complex,

844
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,930
but one of the characteristics is the 
formation of amyloid plaques.

845
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,100
De myelination of the neurons.
Myelin transmits the neural signals,

846
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:58,130
demyelination occurs.
Your outer sheath on the neurons is 

847
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:02,880
interrupted by amyloid plaques that then
prevent neurotransmission.

848
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,800
So the experiments with the mice,
which I think are so interesting was one

849
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:12,801
experiment was the the maze experiment 
where the mice were put into an arena 

850
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:20,150
and they went out of the corridor and 
they went one way in the corridor or 

851
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:20,310
they'd find food the other way.
There's no food.

852
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,020
Well,
very quickly the mice learned,

853
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,700
you know,
you go out the corridor,

854
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,410
go to the left,
you find food,

855
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:30,950
they injected it.
Then with a toxic polypeptide that 

856
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,160
induces amyloid plaque formation.
That is a neurotoxin.

857
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:37,540
very quickly after two weeks or so,
the mice developed neuropathy.

858
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:43,380
They got confused.
They couldn't remember which way to go 

859
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,980
at randomized.
Upon giving these mice again,

860
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:48,860
mushrooms for a few weeks,
they nearly read,

861
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,550
normalized upon sacrificing the mice.

862
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:56,790
And the first part of the experiment,
they saw the amyloid plaques and the de 

863
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,550
myelination.
The second part of the experiment,

864
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,160
of course,
another subset of mice,

865
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:05,140
they found that the myelin regrew and 
the amyloId plaque had resolved.

866
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,200
this is postmortems by say 100 miles.
You're basically cutting their brains 

867
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,470
cutting off a representative sample is 
sacrifice them.

868
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:15,190
You determine,
yeah,

869
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:17,050
that's representative of the population.
Now,

870
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:22,051
the remaining population as alive,
they fed them the mushrooms and they 

871
00:48:22,051 --> 00:48:23,800
found that they regained neurological 
function.

872
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,490
The other experiment,
which I find is even more fun is,

873
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:29,800
um,
and this was done in Japan.

874
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,400
They put like 100 mice in an arena and 
they put a toy in the middle of the 

875
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:37,760
cage.
All the mice got excited,

876
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:39,160
they came up and sniffed it and smelled 
it,

877
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:44,161
and they got really excited and they sat
there with counters to measure the 

878
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,620
number of points of contact,
how many points of contact the mice have

879
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,200
exploring a new toy,
so they got a really good baseline,

880
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:53,260
hundreds of data points,
and then did the same thing.

881
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,440
Then they introduced thiS peptide,
this neurotoxin,

882
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:59,860
and the mice.
Then after awhile were uninterested,

883
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,530
didn't have imagination,
no curiosity.

884
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,720
They put a new toy.
They were disinterested.

885
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,200
They did the same thing.
Now even their full blown dementia like 

886
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,200
symptoms gave them lion's mane 
mushrooms,

887
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,120
and after a few weeks where they put it 
in a new toy,

888
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,120
they came back to near normal levels.
Upon sacrificing the mice,

889
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:21,121
they found that the amyloid plaque had 
resolved and myelin had regenerated and 

890
00:49:21,121 --> 00:49:23,680
neurogenesis had occurred.
This is a smart mushroom.

891
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,510
Now.
The tragedy that we face,

892
00:49:25,511 --> 00:49:30,040
I believe as a society is we have people
like yourself,

893
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:35,490
people like me,
we're all going to suffer through 

894
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,861
neuropathy.
We have a lifetime of a body intellect 

895
00:49:37,861 --> 00:49:38,110
of knowledge that we're going to start 
losing.

896
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,230
So what is the loss to society of our 
elders?

897
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:46,231
Forgetting not remembering.
So I think this is something that's 

898
00:49:46,231 --> 00:49:46,990
reallY extraordinarily exciting.

899
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,890
It's not patentable,
it's the drug companies have no interest

900
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:55,891
in this,
but this is probably the number one 

901
00:49:55,891 --> 00:49:56,660
thing that people can do in my mind to 
present,

902
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,390
to preserve cognitive function,
but to expand it now,

903
00:50:01,391 --> 00:50:06,391
I personally would love to see it legal,
to stack them both together,

904
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,830
stacking psilocybin with lion's mane,
and I think that stacking thing and then

905
00:50:11,831 --> 00:50:16,831
combining it with vitamin d three.
Now by suggest vitamin d three niacin 

906
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,660
because those of you who've had a niacin
flush,

907
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,180
you know,
200 milligrams of niacin or more,

908
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,900
you get red,
you get itchy and neuropathy typically 

909
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,381
is presented at the fingertips at the 
end of your toes and your fingers and 

910
00:50:31,381 --> 00:50:33,860
your peripheral nervous system.
as you have neuropathy,

911
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,080
the nerve endings begin to die 
backwards,

912
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,680
so my idea here is because there are 
different receptors being activated by 

913
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,910
psilocybin than with the [inaudible] 
from lion's mane.

914
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,770
If you stack lion's mane with psilocybin
mushrooms with niacin.

915
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:54,220
The advantages of this is hypothetical,
but this is something I think is well 

916
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:58,121
worth testing is that niacin can help 
drive the neurogenic benefits of 

917
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:01,430
psilocybin and aaron means to the end of
the peripheral nervous system.

918
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:03,970
So we actually have a planning right 
now,

919
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,590
clinical study in Oregon with lion's 
mane mushrooms.

920
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,000
The physicians who've looked at the 
research which is robust,

921
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,800
are convinced that it adds worthy and 
they have their own funding.

922
00:51:15,801 --> 00:51:19,910
So we're going to have 30 study is what 
we hope to do,

923
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,790
30 patients and we hope to begin that 
study in the next year.

924
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,840
It was phenomenal to see how that would 
affect people with cte.

925
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,120
People like football players,
boxers,

926
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,280
people with,
uh,

927
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,110
across,
across the board.

928
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,880
The benefits.
And this is something that when you're 

929
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,121
depressed,
you're not creative and your immune 

930
00:51:43,121 --> 00:51:46,481
system is depressed as well.
You're psychologically emotionally 

931
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:48,020
depressed and you're not as creative 
when you are happy,

932
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,150
you are creative and your immune system 
is better.

933
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:55,340
So this could be fundamental to disease 
mitigation across the board.

934
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,470
So tHis is some of the.
This is,

935
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:02,570
there are so many different examples 
like this where mushrooms need to be 

936
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:06,311
advanced to the front stage of 
consideration by serious scientists and 

937
00:52:06,411 --> 00:52:10,010
give up your michael phobia or even your
silo phobia,

938
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:15,310
the irrational fear of psilocybin 
mushrooms and look upon these with new 

939
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:19,601
eyes and drop your prejudices and just 
look at as a serious scientific 

940
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,750
analysis.
Wow.

941
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:30,220
how is this received?
Like in the general scientific 

942
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:30,220
community?
Is there skepticism?

943
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:35,180
I love my skeptics because unless 
they're prejudice against you,

944
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,250
some people are.
You can never convince them,

945
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:40,700
but if scientists,
when they see the data sets and they see

946
00:52:40,701 --> 00:52:45,701
there's a dozen or more publications 
with scientists without commercial 

947
00:52:45,701 --> 00:52:47,090
interests who've done this 
independently,

948
00:52:47,091 --> 00:52:52,091
then it's being taken very seriously.
So though the whole medical community 

949
00:52:52,091 --> 00:52:53,290
right now,
you know,

950
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,600
I speak at a number of medical 
conferences at ted med,

951
00:52:56,601 --> 00:53:00,020
the american academy of dermatology,
of the keynote speakers.

952
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,830
Many medical conferences.
And,

953
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:08,140
and it's great because I can take people
who are totally skeptical and most of 

954
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:14,921
them walk out of that room convinced,
and why shouldn't we think that fungi 

955
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:16,610
are sources of medicines.
I mean,

956
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:20,450
penicillin may have tipped World war ii 
in our favor.

957
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:26,230
So the job,
the japanese and germans did not have 

958
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:27,060
panelists penicillin,
even though Alexander Fleming discovered

959
00:53:27,061 --> 00:53:32,061
it in 1928 in 1941,
a lab tech researcher went to a market 

960
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,620
in chicago,
found a moldy cantaloupe,

961
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,700
and alexander fleming's strain of 
penicillin was too weak.

962
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:46,701
It couldn't be commercialized.
This lady researcher who found this 

963
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:50,130
moldy cantaloupe found a penicillium 
strain that was 200 times more potent.

964
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:54,750
And as a result of that,
in war,

965
00:53:55,230 --> 00:54:00,180
the most of the casualties died from 
infections.

966
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:05,630
And so the british and the english,
the english and the americans had 

967
00:54:06,691 --> 00:54:09,210
penicillin.
The germans and japanese did not.

968
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:13,860
And so it is.
There's a great npr analysis on this,

969
00:54:13,861 --> 00:54:18,861
on the history of penicillin,
and it is one of the major factors in 

970
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,960
helping tilt the balance in the favor of
the allied powers against the axis 

971
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,830
powers so concerned with the researchers
in england.

972
00:54:25,831 --> 00:54:29,370
They impregnated their clothes with 
spores of this mold strain.

973
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:33,120
So if our laboratories were bombed or 
they were captured,

974
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:38,330
if one of them escaped,
they could regenerate the culture from 

975
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:38,330
their clothing.

976
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:38,330
Whoa.

977
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,910
Wow.
And this speaks to the panspermia.

978
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:48,540
We're all carrying microbiomes of fungi.
The fact that you and I are here 

979
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,891
together means that I have now 
inoculated you with my microbiome of 

980
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,240
selected fungi.
So joe,

981
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:56,440
you are now a vector.

982
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:58,490
Whoa,
awesome.

983
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:02,800
Congratulations.
Now does the frustrating aspects of.

984
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,530
What is the word that you use?
Fungi phobiA.

985
00:55:06,531 --> 00:55:08,720
So we used by co phobia,
michael phobia.

986
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,510
The frustrating aspects are first of 
all,

987
00:55:11,511 --> 00:55:12,530
prohibition,
right?

988
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:17,560
Sweeping psychedelic act of 1970 that 
made psilocybin mushrooms illegal.

989
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,620
Right?
And then on top of it,

990
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,980
the commercial pharmaceutical industry,
which doesn't want to have anything to 

991
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:33,191
do with anything that it can't patent 
and has so many doctors and so many 

992
00:55:33,191 --> 00:55:36,170
researchers in its pocket.
So you have two issues there,

993
00:55:36,171 --> 00:55:37,970
right?
You have one issue that people,

994
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,550
which is obviously why you don't like 
the word shroom.

995
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:44,570
People think of mushrooms as a party 
drug of like being silly,

996
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,300
freaking out,
doing something stupid,

997
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:50,510
regrettable actions.
And then afterwards going,

998
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,070
wow,
we got so crazy.

999
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:57,260
I was thinking of it as a frivolous sort
of thing that you would engage in.

1000
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:03,340
Whereas what you're trying to do is show
the absolute hard science.

1001
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,580
Do you feel that this absolute hard 
science is.

1002
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:14,060
I mean,
you must feel that it's unfairly 

1003
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:14,060
inhibited and hindered.

1004
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:16,880
The sun has been,
but there's never been a title change.

1005
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,550
Uh,
and um,

1006
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:24,570
pharma ecology of the use psilocybin and
um,

1007
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:28,870
and its utility as a therapeutic agent 
is there's a title change.

1008
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:34,140
I think now there's over 700 patients 
have gone through johns hopkins clinical

1009
00:56:36,671 --> 00:56:40,810
trials for things like end of life,
add depression,

1010
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:46,140
ptsd.
There's studies out on treating 

1011
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,140
alcoholics.
And drug addicts,

1012
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,360
so and this is important to communicate 
to people.

1013
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,100
In John Hopkins study in particular,
dr roland griffiths,

1014
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,650
a great,
great scientist.

1015
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:59,170
He's been running and championing these 
studies,

1016
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:04,890
came up with a very interesting series 
of analyses and some of the take home 

1017
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,371
points were only 70 percent of the 
people described the psilocybin 

1018
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:13,000
experience therapeutically under 
controlled settings at John Hopkins with

1019
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:15,160
a very high dose of psilocybin as being 
beneficial.

1020
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,720
Only 70 percent,
70 percent.

1021
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:19,450
Thirty percent of them saying,
I didn't like that,

1022
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:23,590
but in a retrospective study,
14 months to two years later,

1023
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:28,240
the 70 percent of the people who said it
was a beneficial experience,

1024
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:33,270
still described it as one of the most 
significant beneficial experiences of 

1025
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,990
their lifetime and interviewing their 
friends,

1026
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:35,980
their spouses.

1027
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:41,520
They saw a permanent residual effect 
from the benefits of the experience.

1028
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:45,820
There were nicer people.
They're nicer to get along.

1029
00:57:45,821 --> 00:57:50,821
They're less prone to anger.
They had many of values that we would 

1030
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,400
cherish as an improved community of 
individuals.

1031
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,460
The 30 percent of the people who had a 
negative experience,

1032
00:57:57,461 --> 00:58:00,790
the negativity of the experience did not
extend Beyond the experience themselves,

1033
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,570
so they didn't have collateral damage 
where we had collateral benefit,

1034
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:09,990
so the positive people saw that as a 
positive experience and the memory of 

1035
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:10,810
the experience.
This is so cool.

1036
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:16,150
The memory of the experience kept them 
optimistic,

1037
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:21,420
hopeful,
and they felt benefits from just 

1038
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,540
remembering the experience that people 
had a negative experience.

1039
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:26,800
They just wouldn't do that again.
So these mushrooms are obviously not for

1040
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:29,260
everyone,
but for the people who do benefit,

1041
00:58:29,261 --> 00:58:31,240
they benefit substantially.
Don't you feel

1042
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,680
a lot of the people that have those 
negative experiences,

1043
00:58:33,681 --> 00:58:38,681
at least from my understanding,
a lot of it are people that have some 

1044
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:42,911
serious issues that they're not dealing 
with and ego problems and the mushrooms 

1045
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:45,860
expose that and they tried to wrestle 
the mushroom.

1046
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,100
I mean when.

1047
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,270
Absolutely.
I think the very well put.

1048
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:54,510
I think that's a big issue.
Some people are afraid of their inner 

1049
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:54,970
self.
They know we're all.

1050
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,610
He can't paint the canvas,
black and white.

1051
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:03,240
We're a big spectrum of complex 
personality traits and what happens to 

1052
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:06,310
somebody when they're two years old,
five years old,

1053
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,530
what trauma they experience,
you know,

1054
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:11,470
it's very complex to be able to make the
savings,

1055
00:59:11,471 --> 00:59:13,510
but I think as a,
as a group,

1056
00:59:13,511 --> 00:59:18,511
there are some people who are on the 
edge and they may not control their 

1057
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:24,530
innermost emotions and they're afraid of
that in normal state of consciousness.

1058
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:26,570
So they're Afraid they might lose their 
control.

1059
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:27,880
Right?
Yeah.

1060
00:59:27,881 --> 00:59:32,881
I mean I've,
I've had personally some terrIfying 

1061
00:59:32,881 --> 00:59:35,401
psychedelic experiences,
but the way I've gotten through them is 

1062
00:59:35,401 --> 00:59:37,891
just to give in,
just to give in and for a person like 

1063
00:59:37,891 --> 00:59:38,830
myself was kind of a control freak,
especially when I was younger.

1064
00:59:38,831 --> 00:59:42,120
It's a hard thing to do to use because 
you're like,

1065
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:42,300
no,
no,

1066
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,150
no,
I'm going to be fine.

1067
00:59:43,151 --> 00:59:43,310
No,
no,

1068
00:59:43,311 --> 00:59:43,510
no,
no.

1069
00:59:43,511 --> 00:59:44,430
Fuck this.
You know,

1070
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,330
I'm going to know that I don't like 
where this is going.

1071
00:59:46,331 --> 00:59:48,350
I'm going to stop this right now.
I'm going to put a halt to this.

1072
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:51,640
I bring myself back to sobriety like 
it's impossible.

1073
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:56,641
It's not going to happen.
So you have to figure out how to just 

1074
00:59:56,641 --> 01:00:00,061
let go and how to just really let go and
trust the mushroom or the dmt or 

1075
01:00:00,371 --> 01:00:04,180
whatever it is that you're on to take 
you on this ride and you'll be okay when

1076
01:00:04,181 --> 01:00:06,820
it's over.
And if you can't do that,

1077
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:11,970
that's the bad trIp.
And I've seen a lot of people have bad 

1078
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:11,970
trips.

1079
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:11,970
We'll say close friends.
We.

1080
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:16,540
We are the casualty of the fact that we 
don't have an infrastructure tradition 

1081
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,060
in our societies like first peoples and 
native americans too.

1082
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:23,570
They have set up a structure.
They have a tradition shamanically your 

1083
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:23,570
mind,
traditions,

1084
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:24,510
rituals,
elders.

1085
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:27,390
They have done this for a long time.
I have set and setting down.

1086
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,900
They know how to treat these powerful 
medicines in the right context and we 

1087
01:00:33,661 --> 01:00:35,730
lack that.
You did,

1088
01:00:35,731 --> 01:00:40,731
you know that mushrooms were 
specifically banned from beer in the 

1089
01:00:40,731 --> 01:00:42,330
bavarian beer act of 15,
16,

1090
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,880
whoa.
And mushrooms and hen bane and other 

1091
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,720
plants were used in meads psychoactive 
beers and celebrated by people 

1092
01:00:53,971 --> 01:00:57,390
practicing pagan religions in europe,
in the forest.

1093
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,410
And the struggle between,
I believe christianity,

1094
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:04,320
monotheism versus polytheism and nature 
based religions.

1095
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:08,550
There was a collision course and then 
under pressure of the church,

1096
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:13,580
they banned the addition of these plants
that could be your gateway to god 

1097
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:16,710
because the church wanted to be in 
between you and god.

1098
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:22,010
They wanted to get the tIthings.
They wanted to be your portal and 

1099
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:22,170
control,
access to the divine,

1100
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:27,770
and so these mushrooms are looked upon 
as being specifically a threat to 

1101
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:34,220
monotheism and christianity.
So the the very end beer act banned 

1102
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:34,220
mushrooms.

1103
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:38,870
That's incredible.
Terence had some pretty interesting 

1104
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:41,841
ideas about that.
Terence mckenna did one of the things 

1105
01:01:41,841 --> 01:01:44,661
that he said that he believed that as 
the climate changed and some mushrooms 

1106
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:47,661
became less and less available,
they started preserving them in honey 

1107
01:01:47,661 --> 01:01:50,160
because you can preserve things in honey
and that in preserving things in honey,

1108
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:55,110
you also run into the possibility of 
fermented honey and then fermented honey

1109
01:01:55,111 --> 01:02:00,111
becoming mead.
You go into more of an alcohol culture 

1110
01:02:00,111 --> 01:02:02,970
than a psychedelic culture,
which is really like on the opposite end

1111
01:02:02,971 --> 01:02:06,720
of the spectrum.
Alcohol culture is loosened inhibitions,

1112
01:02:06,721 --> 01:02:09,930
wild behavior,
less thought of the consequences of your

1113
01:02:09,931 --> 01:02:12,300
actions,
less introspective,

1114
01:02:12,301 --> 01:02:14,930
thinking much more chaos,
right,

1115
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:20,180
and that he believes that this has 
probably resulted in some sort of a 

1116
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,360
shift he believed rather before he 
passed,

1117
01:02:21,361 --> 01:02:26,361
that was resulted in some sort of a 
shift from these more communal mushroom 

1118
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:33,501
worshiping cultures to what you saw like
in the inquisition and some of the more 

1119
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:35,910
chaotic times in history.

1120
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:39,460
I would respectfully disagree with the 
secoNd part of that analysis,

1121
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:42,520
not what you're saying,
but what terence would have been saying.

1122
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,850
Mushroom being preserved in honey as a 
way of preventing them from rotting.

1123
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,560
Do with mead.
Well you did.

1124
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:50,230
I think it did have something to do with
me,

1125
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,920
but the amount of alcohol being produced
versus the dose that you would get.

1126
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:59,330
It seemed to me this all simon dose Will
be so much more powerful than the small 

1127
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:00,630
amount of alcohol you'd be trying.

1128
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,010
Am I misrepresenting what he was saYing?

1129
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:03,910
No,
I don't think so.

1130
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:05,080
I think you're.
You're,

1131
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:10,350
you have.
You just disagree with his initial idea 

1132
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:10,350
and that's,
that's okay.

1133
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:11,080
You know,
terence isn't terence is,

1134
01:03:11,081 --> 01:03:16,081
it was a very smart guy and I still 
appreciate and love him wandering 

1135
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:20,281
thoughts and they were amazing,
but his time timewave zero was totally 

1136
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:20,281
bs,
so that was crazy.

1137
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:24,840
That was crazy.
He had the end of time occurring on his 

1138
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:24,840
birthday.
I go,

1139
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:24,840
don't you think that's a little 
egocentric?

1140
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,650
No.
Well,

1141
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:31,700
he also had some strange sort of a 
computer program and I've tried to 

1142
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:31,700
follow it many,
many times.

1143
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:36,081
Some of the lectures that he gave on 
that computer program that represented 

1144
01:03:36,081 --> 01:03:38,580
timewave zero,
the idea was for people interested,

1145
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:43,581
he just thought there was going to come 
a point of ultimate novelty and somehow 

1146
01:03:43,581 --> 01:03:48,201
or another conveniently he had that 
point coinciding with both his birthday 

1147
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:48,990
and the end of the mayan calendar.
Right?

1148
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

1149
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,260
His birthday was december 20,
first 2012 as well.

1150
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,060
I think so.
Yeah.

1151
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:58,430
But the other thing to celebrate totally
egotistical,

1152
01:03:58,540 --> 01:03:59,920
I,
I loved him,

1153
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:04,250
but he basically got the math to conform
to the convenience of his birthday.

1154
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:05,830
So it's like

1155
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:08,470
whatever.
We're all guilty of being human.

1156
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:08,750
Yeah,
yeah,

1157
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:10,180
yeah.
I mean even the great ones.

1158
01:04:10,181 --> 01:04:10,730
Yeah.
I mean,

1159
01:04:10,731 --> 01:04:15,731
and he was a great,
he was one of my favorite people in 

1160
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:15,731
terms of like listening to his 
recordings.

1161
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:17,080
Do you ever listen to psychedelic salon?
Oh yeah.

1162
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:17,800
Amazing.

1163
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:21,020
One of the best articulators of the 
english language I've ever.

1164
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,330
Yes.
So yeah,

1165
01:04:22,331 --> 01:04:23,890
I agree.
And as is his brother.

1166
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,980
Yeah.
Every time is how,

1167
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:27,100
which what brings me back to the stoned 
ape theory.

1168
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:28,630
One of the things that his brother 
talked about,

1169
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:33,631
and maybe you could elaborate on this,
was the impact that psilocybin has on 

1170
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:38,550
the creation of language and he thinks 
that the very pathways that you were 

1171
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:42,631
discussing that psilocybin sort of 
empowers that,

1172
01:04:42,641 --> 01:04:47,641
that may very well have been how human 
beings started elaborating on language.

1173
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:52,960
Oh,
I think he's correct on that because a 

1174
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:52,960
glossary leo,
um,

1175
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,800
and we know the neurogenesis occurs in 
the hippocampus.

1176
01:04:55,010 --> 01:05:00,010
Gloss eylea is the ability to speak and 
elocute languages and new words as 

1177
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:06,450
languaging.
Your ability to language is increased 

1178
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:10,390
under the experience of psilocybin.
Speaking to neurogenesis and exactly 

1179
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:13,871
what we've been talking about,
is that basically your hippocampus is 

1180
01:05:13,871 --> 01:05:18,071
your center for learning and memory and 
is why the mice got better because 

1181
01:05:19,481 --> 01:05:24,481
neurogenesis was occurring in the 
hippocampus and so they regained their 

1182
01:05:24,481 --> 01:05:27,430
memory and they were able to learn.
And so yes,

1183
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:31,840
I think this neurogenesis not only 
occurs in the hippocampus,

1184
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:36,841
but I think it can also occur in the 
peripheral nervous system of an 

1185
01:05:36,841 --> 01:05:40,981
extraordinarily powerful story that I 
would like to tell about neurogenesis 

1186
01:05:40,981 --> 01:05:45,511
and um,
it was from a good friend of mine named 

1187
01:05:45,511 --> 01:05:46,540
bill webb.
He lived in big sur California.

1188
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:51,840
He was a friend of ansell adams and 
Henry Miller who wroTe copic tropic of 

1189
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:54,400
capricorn,
whatever it was in the sixties.

1190
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:59,401
This is a big part of the movement in 
the sixties and seventies and antal 

1191
01:05:59,401 --> 01:06:03,331
items is the very famous photographer.
And bill webb was a mentor to me.

1192
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:07,240
I met him in 20 years of age.
I was writing.

1193
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,800
I wrote my first book,
philosophy,

1194
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,870
mushroom,
philosophy,

1195
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:11,950
mushrooms,
and our allies.

1196
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,830
You wrote your first book at 20 axiom?
I was 18.

1197
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:15,870
You bad motherfucker.
Yeah.

1198
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:18,160
It was the weirdest.
I mean,

1199
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:23,190
I haven't told anyone this in 30 years,
but I went up to a place called Montana 

1200
01:06:25,421 --> 01:06:30,421
books in seattle and I had my manuscript
and I walked into the bookstore because 

1201
01:06:30,421 --> 01:06:34,771
I was told Montana books was a kind of 
an avant garde book publisher in the 

1202
01:06:34,771 --> 01:06:39,480
early 19 seventies.
And so I was told to go up there and I 

1203
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,901
made an appointment and then I go in,
I'm meeting with a publisher and he 

1204
01:06:42,901 --> 01:06:42,901
goes,
listen,

1205
01:06:42,901 --> 01:06:43,180
this is an interesting little field 
guide you wrote,

1206
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:44,740
but this is not our market.

1207
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:48,790
You know,
you really need a book representative.

1208
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:50,740
You need an agent.
And he said,

1209
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:53,500
the best agent I know by far is bill 
webb,

1210
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:59,060
you know,
but I haven't seen bill webb in two 

1211
01:06:59,060 --> 01:06:59,060
years,
but you know,

1212
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,940
you really need to see bill webb.
And when he said those words,

1213
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:03,550
the door opened,
a little bell rang.

1214
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:06,990
And in walked bill webb,
he was like,

1215
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:09,820
the publisher goes,
this is freaking crazy,

1216
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:11,230
you know?
So building a webinar,

1217
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,960
I became tightly bonded.
He was a father figure to me.

1218
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:19,200
He was in his seventies when I met him.
So bill and I went down to big sur and 

1219
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,660
we tripped together,
was a great mentoring father,

1220
01:07:22,661 --> 01:07:27,661
son relationship and bill and I became 
very tight and then bill was about 82 

1221
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:31,240
years of age and he calls me up and he 
says,

1222
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:36,540
paul,
I have to tell you something that's so 

1223
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:39,511
important and I want you to listen so 
you understand paul.

1224
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:40,060
I go,
yeah,

1225
01:07:40,061 --> 01:07:40,510
bill,
hi,

1226
01:07:40,511 --> 01:07:41,230
how are you doing?
He goes,

1227
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:42,730
well,
not doing too well.

1228
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:47,790
I'm losing my sight.
I'm losing my hearing and getting a 

1229
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:48,040
getting old sucks.
He said,

1230
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:50,380
but I want to tell you something that's 
really important.

1231
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,640
You know,
great.

1232
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:53,410
bill hasn't tell me to know.
Paul,

1233
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:57,580
I want you to absolutely swear to me.
You will tell this to other people.

1234
01:07:58,030 --> 01:07:59,110
I go,
got it,

1235
01:07:59,111 --> 01:08:00,540
bill.
I said,

1236
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:01,210
okay,
bill,

1237
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,220
you've laid.
I made the promise.

1238
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,300
What is it?
He goes,

1239
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,900
okay,
I've had this fricking hearing aid and I

1240
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:12,901
hate it.
I can't hear the birds or the waves 

1241
01:08:12,901 --> 01:08:16,470
breaking on the beach.
And that's a big part of the big sur 

1242
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:16,470
experience live above the cliffs of big 
sur.

1243
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,480
And I said,
well,

1244
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:18,860
what w w,
w how this relate?

1245
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,030
And he goes,
well,

1246
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,850
I did a five gram dose of cubensis.

1247
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,400
That's the hero's journey for people who
are listening.

1248
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,890
Five grams is,
is is it,

1249
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,030
you know,
you're on the floor,

1250
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,910
and was on his deck and it was house in 
and he noticed that he dIdn't.

1251
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,070
his hearing aid,
he could hear the birds in the waves and

1252
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,320
things like that.
And he's laying there just.

1253
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:41,900
He's like 80,
80,

1254
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:47,010
mid eighties at that point.
And he's just like having this 

1255
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:49,660
incredibly blissful experience.
He's coming there to reconcile his own 

1256
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:50,600
mortality.
The fact that he's going to die,

1257
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:55,490
he's thinking about his life and he's 
kind of dreaming in that dreamscape.

1258
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:57,680
And he hears,
click,

1259
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:58,970
click,
click,

1260
01:08:58,971 --> 01:08:59,390
click,
click,

1261
01:08:59,391 --> 01:09:00,140
click,
click.

1262
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,040
He looks around and he goes,
what's that noise?

1263
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,890
He shakes his ear.
Maybe something is click,

1264
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:08,530
click,
click,

1265
01:09:08,531 --> 01:09:08,890
click,
click,

1266
01:09:08,891 --> 01:09:09,440
click,
click.

1267
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,710
He looks around and he decided,
he's driving me crazy.

1268
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:14,330
I go,
where's the sound coming from?

1269
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:19,710
And he finally looked over and it was 
ants walking on the deck by near his 

1270
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,500
head.
He could hear their footsteps.

1271
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:26,510
Neurogenesis.
Jesus christ,

1272
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:31,890
and this is an easily measurable metric,
silicide and experienced while he was 

1273
01:09:32,151 --> 01:09:35,180
fully on the experience,
he said he did not use a hearing aid for

1274
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:37,340
three or four days.
Now I've mentioned this today,

1275
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:38,990
just do mushrooms again and keep the 
hearing.

1276
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:44,200
Well,
that's basically he ran out of cubensis 

1277
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:44,200
and so hearing he was asking me for 
cubensis and that's.

1278
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:48,200
I'm sorry I can't get provided.
So I've mentioned this now to several of

1279
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:51,650
the clinical researchers who have dea 
licensed or doing clinical research.

1280
01:09:51,651 --> 01:09:56,651
This is an easily measurable metric you 
can do as people were fully,

1281
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:02,380
you know,
in these sessions they could be giving 

1282
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:05,351
them auditory stimulation to see if the 
auditory nerve is undergoing regena 

1283
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:11,390
neurogenesis and so this is something 
that I think that can be incorporated in

1284
01:10:11,391 --> 01:10:13,010
the clinical studies to see if this is 
true.

1285
01:10:13,011 --> 01:10:16,280
But bill was emphatic and when bill webb
spoke,

1286
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,290
he had enormous gravitas.

1287
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:23,530
This guy was a serious intellectual.
So I think this is a end of one study,

1288
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:29,230
one individual,
but I think this is something that 

1289
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:29,230
medical researchers did you pay 
attention to.

1290
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:33,440
What do you think could possibly 
regenerate anything that quickly though,

1291
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:37,910
like how could it happen so quickly that
during the excited for our trip,

1292
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:42,970
because they're like nodes of crossing 
and there's an interconnectedness that 

1293
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:47,411
occurs and there's a great graphic which
I didn't send you an advance showing 

1294
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:52,720
this is your brain without psilocybin.
This is your brain will whistles simon,

1295
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:56,390
and there's a massive amount of neural 
connections that are occurring.

1296
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,720
so I think,
um,

1297
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,350
you know,
the,

1298
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,810
just like water chooses the path of 
least resistance.

1299
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:04,880
I think that neurologically,
if,

1300
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:09,900
if there is a neurological pathway that 
can help you as a species,

1301
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:15,881
as an individual survive,
should there be a saber tooth tiger on 

1302
01:11:15,881 --> 01:11:19,791
the horizon,
then I think that the economy of energy 

1303
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:24,170
in nature would reward the neurological 
pathways that are most likely to lead to

1304
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:25,950
your survival.

1305
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:31,130
So I think that neurogenesis across the 
brain occurred just like me with my 

1306
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:33,090
stuttering and there was another 
neurological pathway.

1307
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:38,450
BuT in bill's case,
when he lost his access to those 

1308
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:42,171
mushrooms,
the neuropathy became more resident and 

1309
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:47,931
prominent.
And so what we're looking at these 

1310
01:11:47,931 --> 01:11:47,931
images mean we just put jamie's the 
best.

1311
01:11:47,931 --> 01:11:49,380
We're just,
we're looking at these images.

1312
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:51,390
And could you explain to us what these 
are?

1313
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,110
This is your brain on magic mushrooms.
Exactly.

1314
01:11:55,111 --> 01:12:00,111
Opposite of nancy reagan's mantra here.
Yeah,

1315
01:12:00,361 --> 01:12:03,390
this is.
You can push this up to your faces.

1316
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:06,690
The,
the placebos on the left.

1317
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:11,720
This is your normal representation of 
interconnectedness between the nodes of 

1318
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:13,980
your brain.
So I try to explain this to people.

1319
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:16,480
most of the people are just listening 
rather than viewing.

1320
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:17,810
Okay.
So the,

1321
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:22,910
the one on the left,
it basically shows the connections 

1322
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:27,801
between neuronal nodes that maybe on the
order of 40 or 50 different nodes of 

1323
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:29,610
crossing.

1324
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:35,390
The one on the right with psilocybin is 
literally in the hundreds and the nodes 

1325
01:12:35,971 --> 01:12:40,971
of crossing not only are more of them,
but the thickness of the lines speaks to

1326
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:49,290
how robust those nodes are crossing are 
for carrying neurological signals.

1327
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:52,140
So this is pretty amazing.
Now,

1328
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:57,141
this also influences,
I think is important for our us 

1329
01:12:57,141 --> 01:12:58,450
military,
you know,

1330
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:00,480
for,
for coders,

1331
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:06,290
for people who are trying to solve very 
complex data sets.

1332
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:11,070
The ability of you to have increased 
cognition and increased intelligence,

1333
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,880
and this is why microdosing is the rage 
in silicon valley.

1334
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:20,430
Enormous number of coders are 
microdosing right now and for those who 

1335
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:24,621
are listening,
this loose use philosophy cubensis as 

1336
01:13:24,621 --> 01:13:27,711
the standard species because that's the 
one that's mostly grown and at a half a 

1337
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:31,320
gram to a quarter gram you have lift 
off.

1338
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:34,830
Five grams is the full blown hero's 
journey.

1339
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:39,960
A lot of people will take between two 
and four grams as a moderately spiritual

1340
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:40,650
experience.

1341
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:45,650
Four grams being higher and so 
microdosing is is taking a dose so low 

1342
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:55,290
that if at most you might feel it a 
little bit giddy the first time you take

1343
01:13:55,291 --> 01:14:00,291
it the first day,
but you build up a tolerance 

1344
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:00,291
immediately.
The second day,

1345
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:03,570
second day you feel nothing.
So that's on the order of a 10th of a 

1346
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:06,801
gram of cubensis Where people are taking
this and then they're taking it 

1347
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:13,131
repeatedly over time and coders in 
silicon valley from the biggest computer

1348
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:21,750
companies that we all know.
This is a not only a fashion but a tool 

1349
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:29,340
that they are seeing an increased 
ability for coming up with codes and as 

1350
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,670
a competitive advantage in the 
capitalistic system.

1351
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:36,210
I have a good friend who's a world 
champion kickboxer and one of the best 

1352
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:39,391
in the world.
He microdose is daily and he's been 

1353
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:41,110
doing it over the last leg,
I want to say probably year or so,

1354
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:46,320
and he.
He has achieved phenomenal improvements 

1355
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:46,320
in his performance.
Because of that.

1356
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,520
He says that when he's sparring,
it's almost like he's psychic,

1357
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,890
like he knows what people are going to 
do before they do it.

1358
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,560
He said his mood is better.
He feels better.

1359
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:58,330
He just feels more balanced and he'll 
take days off and when he takes days off

1360
01:14:58,331 --> 01:15:03,331
and even though he's completely sober 
while he's microdosing because he's 

1361
01:15:03,331 --> 01:15:06,661
really only microdosing.
There's something about taking days off 

1362
01:15:06,661 --> 01:15:07,840
Where everything just feels like kind of
shitty,

1363
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,640
just doesn't feel good.
And then he's like,

1364
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:10,690
oh,
I didn't.

1365
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:15,780
I didn't take my microdose.
And so he takes it again and goes right 

1366
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:16,840
back to that place,
but he feels like he's in the matrix.

1367
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:22,400
Well,
actually it's probably good that he 

1368
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,490
interrupts it because it washes those 
receptors clean of this all,

1369
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:28,530
simon and the time.
Do you think you should interrupt for 

1370
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:28,530
two days out of out of seven,
so five days on,

1371
01:15:28,531 --> 01:15:33,531
two days off.
Now I'm not making official 

1372
01:15:33,531 --> 01:15:35,601
recommendations.
I'm just saying from from my my small 

1373
01:15:39,361 --> 01:15:41,180
amount of knowledge on the subject,
I.

1374
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:46,410
I think that makes sense and that's 
consistent with traditional chinese 

1375
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:46,560
medicine.
It's also consistent for those of us who

1376
01:15:46,561 --> 01:15:50,010
drink coffee like myself.
You drink coffee for five days,

1377
01:15:50,011 --> 01:15:55,011
you take two days off.
That next day is the strongest cup of 

1378
01:15:55,011 --> 01:15:55,011
coffee you've had in a long time.

1379
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,960
Me and my friends who are just coming to
the next podcast after this,

1380
01:15:57,961 --> 01:16:01,500
we just got done doing sober october.
So no alcohol,

1381
01:16:01,501 --> 01:16:02,880
no marijuana,
no nothing.

1382
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:07,500
We drank coffee but that's it.
And when I stopped smoking marijuana,

1383
01:16:07,501 --> 01:16:11,370
the first thing that happened is my 
dreams became rocket charged.

1384
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:14,130
Like very biZarre,
like crazy,

1385
01:16:14,131 --> 01:16:16,380
lucid,
strange,

1386
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:21,560
weird dreams.
Not lucid in the sense that controlled 

1387
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,230
them,
but lucid in the sense that I realized I

1388
01:16:22,231 --> 01:16:26,970
was dreaming and I was just like having 
incredibly vivid,

1389
01:16:26,971 --> 01:16:31,971
vibrant dreams and I would wake up from 
them and be certain that what I had done

1390
01:16:32,761 --> 01:16:37,761
was real.
Like I had one dream that I fell Asleep 

1391
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:37,830
on the couch and why I did fall asleep 
on the couch.

1392
01:16:37,831 --> 01:16:39,870
But while I was asleep I was like,
oh,

1393
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:44,930
I'm struggling to get this blanket over 
me while I'm on the couch and I'm 

1394
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:48,591
pulling it,
but it's stuck under the cushions and 

1395
01:16:48,591 --> 01:16:48,960
I'm struggling and I kinda halfway got 
it over me and I went to sleep again.

1396
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:50,430
Well,
when I woke up in the morning,

1397
01:16:50,431 --> 01:16:52,950
there was no blanket.
There's no blanket anywhere near me.

1398
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:58,650
Didn't exist.
I had a lucid dream about covering 

1399
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:00,990
myself with a blanket while I was 
sleeping on this couch.

1400
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:06,470
Very strange and very primal dreams too.
Like being chased by wolves and running 

1401
01:17:08,191 --> 01:17:12,200
into bears in and really bizarre,
very,

1402
01:17:12,201 --> 01:17:14,460
very vibrant colors.
And,

1403
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,840
and apparently from what I've read,
marijuana does something to suppress rem

1404
01:17:20,391 --> 01:17:24,490
sleep and that in taking time off of it,
your,

1405
01:17:24,491 --> 01:17:26,720
your rem sleep just gets jacked through 
the roof.

1406
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,370
You know,
I've heard this many,

1407
01:17:28,371 --> 01:17:33,371
many times,
I've never seen in a clinical study on 

1408
01:17:33,371 --> 01:17:33,371
it,
but it's that type of thing.

1409
01:17:33,371 --> 01:17:37,241
You hear so many times that you have 
pretty good confidence that this is 

1410
01:17:37,241 --> 01:17:37,241
true.

1411
01:17:37,241 --> 01:17:38,180
well,
we all experienced it.

1412
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:43,240
All my friends who did it experienced at
ari in particular probably smokes as 

1413
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:43,240
much as I do,
maybe more.

1414
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,090
I'm he experienced it deeply.

1415
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:49,280
I'm glad that you mentioned lucid dreams
because this is a nice segue to I think 

1416
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,970
the greatest discovery I've made up my 
life and I want us all came through a 

1417
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:54,540
lucid dream.
So let me,

1418
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:59,541
let me set the stage here.
And a colony collapse disorder is a 

1419
01:17:59,761 --> 01:18:02,190
threat to worldwide food,
biosecurity,

1420
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:07,280
and killing bees.
Bees around the world are being 

1421
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:07,280
decimated.
Say the name of the disorder again,

1422
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:12,200
colony collapse disorder disorder.
Now bees are dying off in enormous 

1423
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:16,290
quantities.
Oklahoma lost 85 percent of his beehives

1424
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:19,740
last year or this 2016,
2017.

1425
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:25,010
The annual loss of bees report and 
Maryland lost 75 percent.

1426
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:32,420
Nebraska I think lost 60 percent.
I met a beekeeper in Washington state 

1427
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,930
who lost 75 percent of his 35,000
hives.

1428
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:39,680
Now apex mila for is the honeybee and 
this factory farm now and the almond 

1429
01:18:39,901 --> 01:18:44,901
harvest in California is the biggest 
market for beekeepers who send their 

1430
01:18:45,061 --> 01:18:47,310
bees to the almond orchards.

1431
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:51,360
One bee component,
a thousand flowers and a day,

1432
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:55,140
so every flower that bee visits is an 
almond,

1433
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:58,560
so it's one of the most bee dependent 
crops in the world.

1434
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:03,180
Thirty five percent of your food is 
directly dependent upon bee pollination.

1435
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:07,740
The other 65 percent,
much of that is indirectly dependent,

1436
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:11,490
but hay,
alfalfa and clover for cows.

1437
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:14,700
All of our dairy is dependent upon bee 
pollination.

1438
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:17,010
All of our berries,
all of our nuts,

1439
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:22,490
coffee is even cannabis and other non 
dependent plants benefit from what's 

1440
01:19:25,351 --> 01:19:30,351
called buzz pollination because the bees
then can spread the pollen better 

1441
01:19:30,351 --> 01:19:35,150
through the error.
It is now a thought by many of the 

1442
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:40,131
entomologist I've been dealing with,
that we could have full colony collapse 

1443
01:19:40,131 --> 01:19:42,270
across the world within 10 years.
The cost,

1444
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:47,480
it will be astronomical to our society.
Prices where food will raise poverty 

1445
01:19:47,701 --> 01:19:52,701
will increase.
You could make the argument that 

1446
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:54,060
increased poverty leads to terrorism 
because people are poorer,

1447
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:58,680
they're desperate,
and so colony collapse now is much worse

1448
01:19:58,681 --> 01:20:02,610
than most people realize because all the
wild bees have now been infected.

1449
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:08,120
So 80 percent of pollination services 
come from wild bees and 20 percent from 

1450
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:12,410
managed honeybees.
Eva's [inaudible] is from a honey bee 

1451
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:14,400
from europe,
brought over in the 17 hundreds in 1984.

1452
01:20:14,401 --> 01:20:19,401
The varroa mite was introduced in the 
United States and the varroa mite has is

1453
01:20:19,521 --> 01:20:24,521
like a is a parasite on the backs of 
bees and injects viruses and 

1454
01:20:24,521 --> 01:20:27,630
particularly the deformed wing virus,
the lake sinai virus,

1455
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:32,660
and the black queen cell virus.
The Deformed wing virus is the really 

1456
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:36,021
the most important one.
Bees used to go and they only live 30 

1457
01:20:36,021 --> 01:20:40,251
days,
but now they used to go pollinating for 

1458
01:20:40,251 --> 01:20:43,161
nine days,
so they leave the hive and they 

1459
01:20:43,161 --> 01:20:44,580
pollinate for about nine days.
I'd bring back pollen and uh,

1460
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:47,010
that's their service to the hive and 
they die off.

1461
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:50,370
Now the average time for pollination is 
only four days.

1462
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:56,150
The order to fight the mites,
they've been using a toxic insecticide 

1463
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:56,260
called emma.

1464
01:20:56,830 --> 01:21:00,360
EMma tries.
Fights is licensed for fighting ticks on

1465
01:21:00,361 --> 01:21:05,130
cattle using cattle strength doses of 
ama tries off label.

1466
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:08,970
Beekeepers have been drenching their 
hives with amtrust twice per year.

1467
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:13,050
Now the mites have built up tolerance 
and now they're up to nine times a year.

1468
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:18,200
They're soaking the hives in order to 
kill the mites because mites are 

1469
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:18,810
injecting these viruses.
This is all hands on deck.

1470
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:21,930
This is the proverbial shit's gonna hit 
the fan on.

1471
01:21:21,931 --> 01:21:25,740
This is an extremely important and 
interestingly,

1472
01:21:25,741 --> 01:21:28,740
it's the number one bridge issue between
liberals and conservatives.

1473
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,770
So when you're at thanksgiving dinner or
christmas or hanukkah,

1474
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:37,160
if you want to avoid talking about trump
and politics and hillary or benghazi or 

1475
01:21:37,621 --> 01:21:39,310
whatever that subject,
you know,

1476
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,550
dispute is.
Talk about bees.

1477
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,160
Everyone's on board on protecting the 
bees.

1478
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:49,520
So I had a waking dream first 1984.
I had two beehives.

1479
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:55,970
I planted a mushroom in my garden called
the garden giant and one time this 

1480
01:21:55,970 --> 01:22:00,591
summer I came out to water my mushrooms 
and it was covered with bees and the 

1481
01:22:00,591 --> 01:22:05,181
bees moved the wood chips aside and I 
could see these white mycelium and they 

1482
01:22:05,181 --> 01:22:07,440
were sipping on the little droplets of 
oozing from the mycelium.

1483
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:11,730
I got real excited and I kept a journal 
and for fortY days from dawn to dusk,

1484
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,550
there was a continuous convoy of bees to
my mushroom bed.

1485
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,250
Does that edible edible mushrooms?
Um,

1486
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:19,020
and I made note of it.
I published it.

1487
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:20,940
and then harris smith magazine,
1988.

1488
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:23,880
I put it in one of my books in 1994.
And then I forgot about it.

1489
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:29,930
So I got involved with us biosil 
biodefense program directly after nine 

1490
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:30,120
slash 11.
You can google my name,

1491
01:22:30,121 --> 01:22:35,121
stamets and smallpox.
There's a vetted press release from the 

1492
01:22:35,121 --> 01:22:35,121
us government.
We,

1493
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:36,640
we the,
the,

1494
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:41,780
did 2,200
plus analyses of our mushroom extracts 

1495
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:48,230
and we found extracts that were highly 
active against flu viruses against 

1496
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:51,030
including bird flu against herpes and 
against pox viruses,

1497
01:22:51,031 --> 01:22:53,850
including smallpox.
So I have a patent that issued on,

1498
01:22:53,851 --> 01:22:58,851
this is a great secondary story because 
I had black hawk helicopters coming over

1499
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,930
my laboratory,
all this other stuff.

1500
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:09,930
So it's a true conspiracy story.
So I had published this research on the 

1501
01:23:11,681 --> 01:23:13,930
antiviral properties of mushrooms,
the mycelium,

1502
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,330
and then I heard about the bees,
you know,

1503
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,910
I'd raised bees and then a friend of 
mine,

1504
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:23,911
louie schwartzberg,
we're doing a movie called fantastic 

1505
01:23:23,911 --> 01:23:25,921
fungi making for 10 years.
And louie came to me and said,

1506
01:23:26,351 --> 01:23:31,351
paul,
I have eight patents on fungi that can 

1507
01:23:31,351 --> 01:23:32,260
control termites,
ants,

1508
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:34,840
mosquitoes,
you can google right now.

1509
01:23:34,841 --> 01:23:39,841
Stamets can take down monsanto.
There's probably a thousand websites 

1510
01:23:39,841 --> 01:23:41,050
because my patents are disruptive 
patents,

1511
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:46,420
so I can very much control termites.
Ants from consuming your house for about

1512
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:51,421
twenty cents.
And I met with all the big companies 

1513
01:23:51,421 --> 01:23:51,421
but,
but anyhow,

1514
01:23:51,421 --> 01:23:55,150
so louie knew about my research on that.
I've spoken on this before and he said,

1515
01:23:55,151 --> 01:23:56,740
paul,
the mites are killing the bees,

1516
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,960
can't you do something to help the 
mites?

1517
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:02,950
And so now that's two stories.

1518
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:06,040
We have this bio shield biodefense story
and my antiviral stuff.

1519
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:11,041
We have me growing the mushrooms in the 
garden and a hike in the old growth 

1520
01:24:11,041 --> 01:24:13,390
forest a lot and I'm hiking the old 
growth for us.

1521
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:17,000
And the way I orienteer it'S one of the 
few skill sets I have.

1522
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:22,230
I like just getting off trail and I'm 
the south fork of the hoh river and I'm 

1523
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:27,330
deep in the old growth forest.
I come around a corner and I see a bear 

1524
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:27,330
strike.
The bear came up,

1525
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,990
bam,
scratched this tree,

1526
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:33,250
huge paw strike in the tree.
And I told my wife,

1527
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:34,120
I said,
you know,

1528
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:40,410
the Washington state,
the school system is dependent upon 

1529
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:43,120
funding from selling timber to the 
lumber,

1530
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:48,150
lumber companies.
So the school system dependent upon 

1531
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:48,250
timber harvest,
off of public lands.

1532
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:50,980
So in humans,
great wisdom.

1533
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:56,760
They decided that the bears were 
jeopardizing the educational funds in 

1534
01:24:57,041 --> 01:25:02,041
Washington state,
so they hired hunters to kill all the 

1535
01:25:02,041 --> 01:25:02,041
bears.

1536
01:25:02,041 --> 01:25:06,120
So my neighbor killed 400 bears.
That's why we have a salmon run right 

1537
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,290
now on [inaudible] inlet,
and then chemistry point Washington,

1538
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:11,740
there's no bears around because they saw
the bears,

1539
01:25:11,741 --> 01:25:15,580
the threat to the economic stability,
this whole system and why the bears when

1540
01:25:15,581 --> 01:25:20,581
they scratch the trees,
it become an entry room for a poly pore 

1541
01:25:20,581 --> 01:25:20,830
mushrooms.
So I told my wife,

1542
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:26,310
if this is true,
let's come back in two years and see if 

1543
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:26,310
this [inaudible] mushroom is growing 
there.

1544
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:28,330
These are woodcock similar to the one my
hat is made from.

1545
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:32,320
So we came back two years later and sure
enough this wood conk was growing out of

1546
01:25:32,321 --> 01:25:33,400
the tree.
The tree had died,

1547
01:25:33,401 --> 01:25:36,970
so they kind of got it right.
So when bears scratch trees,

1548
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:40,570
resin comes out and bees are attracted 
to the propolis,

1549
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,630
to make propolis from the residence to 
pastor hives from cracks,

1550
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,760
to prevent invaders coming into a 
beehive.

1551
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:50,200
These orals seemingly disparate stories.
And this is why this waking dream put it

1552
01:25:50,201 --> 01:25:55,201
all together.
So I have my garden giant in bed with 

1553
01:25:55,201 --> 01:25:59,620
the bees are coming to the [inaudible] 
biodefense program where I found these 

1554
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:00,610
extracts are highly active against 
viruses,

1555
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:04,760
bear scratched trees,
introduce poly pore mushrooms,

1556
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:08,360
and then with my friend louie 
schwartzberg is saying,

1557
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:13,361
you know,
how can you help the bees so and now I 

1558
01:26:13,361 --> 01:26:16,921
highly recommend this to everybody.
Listening is these lucid dream state at 

1559
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:21,671
that state when you're fully asleep and 
you just go into the ether of 

1560
01:26:21,671 --> 01:26:23,420
wakefulness,
stay there,

1561
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:29,380
reside there.
We have random access memory before you 

1562
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:32,480
get your neurological pathways all set 
up by habit of what you're going to do.

1563
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:38,020
Just exist in that space.
And then I had synopsis activate a new 

1564
01:26:38,901 --> 01:26:40,850
neurological pathway.
I had an epiphany.

1565
01:26:40,851 --> 01:26:42,290
I think I know how to save the bees.

1566
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:47,060
Fast forward now I have multiple patents
issuing all over the world.

1567
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:50,570
We've done research for Washington state
university.

1568
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:53,810
We've gathered two point $5,
million dollars.

1569
01:26:53,811 --> 01:26:58,811
You can go to wsu,
www dot b's dot w s u.edu.

1570
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:05,450
So the wasn't the university.edu
for education.

1571
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:08,150
And you'll see the resource that we 
have.

1572
01:27:08,151 --> 01:27:13,151
There we are.
Now I have found that the extracts of 

1573
01:27:13,151 --> 01:27:18,101
amadou,
the one my hat is made from doubles the 

1574
01:27:18,141 --> 01:27:23,141
lifespans of bees and reduces the 
deformed wing virus by more than a 

1575
01:27:23,141 --> 01:27:26,420
thousand fold in 10 days.
I hit joe,

1576
01:27:26,421 --> 01:27:29,150
the [inaudible] home run.
I'm not an entomologist.

1577
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:32,330
I have two beehives.
I'm not a big beekeeper,

1578
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:37,850
but I put these thoughts together that 
if these mushroom extracts,

1579
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:40,700
reduced viruses that harm humans,
pigs and birds,

1580
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:43,310
what would they do with bees?
Now?

1581
01:27:43,311 --> 01:27:48,311
We all grew up with winnie the pooh,
so my us patent issued this past year 

1582
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:51,740
and now it's issued in Australia,
United States issuing in europe,

1583
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:52,880
eurasia and Canada.

1584
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:55,100
I plan to open source it for the rest of
the world,

1585
01:27:55,670 --> 01:28:00,670
but I was waiting on pins and needles 
because certainly it would be something 

1586
01:28:00,670 --> 01:28:03,551
called prior art.
Patents are issued for and based on 

1587
01:28:03,621 --> 01:28:05,450
several criteria.
One,

1588
01:28:05,451 --> 01:28:07,220
no prior art,
no one's ever mentioned it.

1589
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:10,310
Secondly,
contrary to conventional wisdom,

1590
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:13,100
so if you invented the bicycle,
the wheel,

1591
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,170
then you came up with a tricycle.
That's not patentable.

1592
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:18,560
That's pretty obvious because it's 
logical.

1593
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:19,990
So you want something as.
No,

1594
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:25,020
no evidence in the literature,
public or private or scientific or 

1595
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:27,500
popular.
You want it to contrary to conventional,

1596
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:32,530
conventional wisdom,
which means that you want experts to 

1597
01:28:32,530 --> 01:28:36,131
teach away from your invention.
So every time someone out there and 

1598
01:28:36,131 --> 01:28:36,131
tells me that,
that tells,

1599
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:39,050
I hear that paul stamets is full of 
crap.

1600
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,560
Nothing he says is true.
I have one great response.

1601
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:43,730
I say,
thank you.

1602
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:48,230
You're helping my patentability because 
the more experts that teach away from my

1603
01:28:48,231 --> 01:28:51,110
invention,
the more unconventional my invention is.

1604
01:28:51,111 --> 01:28:54,500
Hence the more patentable it is.
The third criteria is usefulness.

1605
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:57,110
Benjamin franklin could not have 
invented the iphone.

1606
01:28:57,111 --> 01:28:59,360
There's no usefulness and no self cell 
towers.

1607
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:03,120
So there's three criteria for 17 years.
It becomes open source.

1608
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:07,290
So the idea is to incentivize inventors.
That's why you have the iphone,

1609
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:08,460
the droid,
all your computers.

1610
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:13,780
You know,
I had one person call me up in a cell 

1611
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:13,780
phone and said,
how dare you patent this?

1612
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:15,420
I go,
how dare you speak to me on a cell phone

1613
01:29:15,421 --> 01:29:20,421
that was enabled by a patent so you 
could tell me that I shouldn't be 

1614
01:29:20,421 --> 01:29:20,421
patenting things.
I'm just like,

1615
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:25,610
the contradictions are pretty obvious,
so the patents and now have issued and 

1616
01:29:26,401 --> 01:29:31,401
there was no prior art,
even though we all grew up with winnie 

1617
01:29:31,401 --> 01:29:33,471
the pooh,
we knew that bears went into rotted 

1618
01:29:33,471 --> 01:29:33,960
trees to find honey and beehives.

1619
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:39,320
No one apparently until me made the 
connection that bees are attracted to 

1620
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:42,090
the mycelium in rotted logs because of 
immunological benefit.

1621
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:47,390
Now,
let's go back in time because this is a 

1622
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:47,400
very big picture concept here.
Twelve thousand years ago,

1623
01:29:47,401 --> 01:29:49,980
we invented agriculture.
What did we do?

1624
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:54,240
We started to deforest.
When we started cutting down the trees,

1625
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:59,220
we began to dismantle the immunological 
mycelial nets of nature.

1626
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:02,790
Mycelium needs wood to decompose.
You take away the wood.

1627
01:30:02,791 --> 01:30:07,791
There's mycelium doesn't have a habitat 
because the mycelium is producing these 

1628
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:09,570
antiviral compounds,
rotting the wood,

1629
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:12,870
the bees were attracted,
and because of deforestation,

1630
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:17,871
now we're stressing the bees.
So there's not only the lack of habitat 

1631
01:30:18,331 --> 01:30:23,331
deforestation,
there's now neonicotinoids behr and 

1632
01:30:23,331 --> 01:30:26,661
syngenta syngenta that produces neonics 
as or known a toxic insecticide,

1633
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:32,270
um,
sponsored research in europe because 

1634
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:32,270
they didn't believe that new indicative 
noise harm the bees.

1635
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:37,310
There'll be research,
the researchers then finally published 

1636
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:40,700
when they got the results that was 
contrary to the interests of syngenta 

1637
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:41,550
and bear that in fact neonicotinoids 
harm.

1638
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:44,790
The second and third generation is now 
neonicotinoids are now banned in europe.

1639
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:47,010
They are not banned in the United 
States,

1640
01:30:47,011 --> 01:30:50,190
so you have drift of these new 
indicative to whites on there,

1641
01:30:50,191 --> 01:30:53,790
Jason Fields,
so you have loss of wood deforestation,

1642
01:30:53,791 --> 01:30:56,640
you have neonicotinoids,
you have gli phosphates,

1643
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:01,700
whether they're associated with gmos 
because they interfere with the 

1644
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:01,700
microbiome of the bees and their gut 
flora,

1645
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:04,200
so they can't detoxify.
It's called the cytochrome p 4:50

1646
01:31:04,201 --> 01:31:06,900
pathway that we all have it breaking 
down toxins.

1647
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:09,210
So there's a confluence of multiple 
stressors,

1648
01:31:09,211 --> 01:31:14,211
but the nail in the coffin by far is the
deformed wing virus and we have found 

1649
01:31:14,211 --> 01:31:16,830
now the extracts of this one drop per 
thousand drops.

1650
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:22,130
One milliliter in a leader can reduce 
the viruses in bees by more than a 

1651
01:31:22,130 --> 01:31:26,840
thousand fold and double the lifespan.
So it's a frigging homerun because it 

1652
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:30,270
protects food biosecurity around the 
world at a time that food ecosystems are

1653
01:31:30,271 --> 01:31:30,870
collapsing.

1654
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:34,230
But think of the bigger picture here.
For millions of years,

1655
01:31:34,231 --> 01:31:36,780
we were forest people.
We began deforestation.

1656
01:31:36,781 --> 01:31:41,781
When we got into agriculture,
we began to dismantle the immunological 

1657
01:31:41,781 --> 01:31:42,570
networks of nature,
the mycelium,

1658
01:31:42,571 --> 01:31:47,571
this resident,
the fact that these same mushrooms that 

1659
01:31:47,571 --> 01:31:48,090
reduce viruses in bees,
pigs,

1660
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:54,110
birds,
people speaks to me of a bigger concept 

1661
01:31:55,860 --> 01:32:00,860
that the mycelium is part of the 
immunity of the and as we lose the 

1662
01:32:01,871 --> 01:32:04,660
debris fields that the mycelium is 
dependent upon,

1663
01:32:04,661 --> 01:32:09,661
we began to dismantle the immunological 
health of our environment and zoonotic 

1664
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:12,490
diseases,
diseases coming from factory farms,

1665
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:15,460
whether they're from pigs or chicken 
farms.

1666
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:20,940
And we have one extraordinary experiment
and this speaks to the black hawk 

1667
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:26,221
helicopter story is that I was working 
with biosil biodefense program directly 

1668
01:32:26,981 --> 01:32:31,981
after nine slash 11.
They contacted me because I wrote an 

1669
01:32:31,981 --> 01:32:35,190
article that was a one page analysis of 
all the research on the antiviral 

1670
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:38,080
properties of mushrooms in scientific 
literature.

1671
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:40,990
I wrote this article published in a peer
reviewed journal.

1672
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:45,190
Bioterrorism became the front and center
of concern of the us defense department.

1673
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:50,790
A group of radiologists saw my article 
and they got funded by dick cheney and 

1674
01:32:51,671 --> 01:32:53,910
George Bush and I have,
you know,

1675
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:59,040
I want to say thank you ironically to 
those two because they funded the bio 

1676
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:03,581
shield is called project biodefense and 
they funded it with several billion 

1677
01:33:03,581 --> 01:33:08,040
dollars and they contacted me because I 
knew I had this large library of about 

1678
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,220
700 strains of mushrooms in our culture 
library.

1679
01:33:09,221 --> 01:33:14,221
We have a company of 78 great employees 
and we had this large library,

1680
01:33:16,751 --> 01:33:21,751
so they said,
we want to test your library based on 

1681
01:33:21,751 --> 01:33:24,871
this article that you've written,
showing there are antiviral properties 

1682
01:33:24,871 --> 01:33:24,871
in some mushrooms.
You have a lot of them.

1683
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:27,760
Let's test your library to see if we 
have antiviral properties.

1684
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:33,390
So great.
So I started making extracts of 

1685
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:33,390
mushrooms,
the fruit bodies,

1686
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:37,981
the mycelium,
the little filamentous fuzzy stuff that 

1687
01:33:37,981 --> 01:33:40,171
gives rise to mushrooms and I sent off a
hundred extracts at a time all coded 

1688
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:42,700
with alphanumeric codes.

1689
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:47,970
So they didn't.
The government didn't know how sending 

1690
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:48,550
them.
So I get the first reports come back and

1691
01:33:48,551 --> 01:33:50,800
I'm flipping through them.
No activity,

1692
01:33:50,801 --> 01:33:55,801
no activity against pox viruses,
because by far the concern was smallpox 

1693
01:33:56,110 --> 01:34:00,160
the biggest.
We have no immunological defense against

1694
01:34:00,161 --> 01:34:01,050
it.
Um,

1695
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:06,570
after 1974 they stopped immunizing.
Do you have a smallpox vaccinaTion on 

1696
01:34:06,570 --> 01:34:08,560
your arm is probably one of the last 
ones that were getting it.

1697
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:14,730
So I'm going through a night,
come to sample 78 and it said high 

1698
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:14,730
activity.
Whoa.

1699
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:15,970
You know,
sample 81 high activity.

1700
01:34:15,971 --> 01:34:17,340
Whoa.
I got really excited.

1701
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:19,570
I looked at my notebook,
what the codes were,

1702
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:24,840
and it was from this mushroom called 
[inaudible] that grows exclusively in 

1703
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:25,810
the old growth forests of the pacific 
northwest.

1704
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:29,410
This is the longest living mushroom in 
north America.

1705
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:35,010
It's a perennial poly poor.
It looks like a giant beehive by 

1706
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:36,400
coincidence up on a tree so you can get 
a picture of jana.

1707
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:40,630
And so a garrick on a g,
a r I,

1708
01:34:40,631 --> 01:34:42,200
k o,
n and a.

1709
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:47,220
So I got real excited and I Was given a 
contact person because he had one point 

1710
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:48,310
of contact with us,
the defense department,

1711
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:50,500
a physician,
and I called him up saying,

1712
01:34:50,510 --> 01:34:53,260
these researchers,
these research results are wonderful.

1713
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:55,210
He goes,
what research results?

1714
01:34:55,240 --> 01:35:00,240
I go,
federal express just delivered me this 

1715
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:00,240
whole dossier and the first hundred 
samples,

1716
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:00,530
wow,
look at that.

1717
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:02,360
And,
and he goes,

1718
01:35:02,361 --> 01:35:04,610
you're not supposed to get those.
I am.

1719
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:06,020
I said,
well,

1720
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:11,110
I'll photocopy and send them to you.
So he didn't think that was too funny,

1721
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:15,110
but that's the us government sometimes 
is not very well organized.

1722
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,850
The left hand doesn't talk to the right 
hand.

1723
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,840
So we got these research results.
It's crazy.

1724
01:35:20,841 --> 01:35:25,841
That looks like a stick up a dude's.
But this one is particularly unusual 

1725
01:35:26,121 --> 01:35:28,880
because it was attached to an upper 
branch.

1726
01:35:28,881 --> 01:35:32,960
It fell through the air,
hit the other branch and teeter tottered

1727
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:36,710
and then it regrew it's mycelium and it 
connected back into the mother.

1728
01:35:36,711 --> 01:35:38,870
Mycelium inside the tree.
And then it grew two legs.

1729
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:44,350
So this is like,
this was first described by the ice 

1730
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:47,821
core.
It says 65 is ed as [inaudible] ad 

1731
01:35:47,821 --> 01:35:51,131
longum vitam the elixir of long life.
So this has been used in greek 

1732
01:35:51,131 --> 01:35:52,300
pharmacopoeia for,
for,

1733
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:54,480
for thousands of years.
So please get back to your store.

1734
01:35:54,481 --> 01:35:55,580
Sorry for the interruption.

1735
01:35:57,630 --> 01:36:00,380
It's one aisle.
I'm up in Canada.

1736
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:04,730
And one of my managers calls me up,
says paul,

1737
01:36:04,731 --> 01:36:07,220
there's a helicopter who are the 
laboratories?

1738
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:08,570
I go,
no big deal.

1739
01:36:08,571 --> 01:36:11,480
And helicopters come and go because no,
it's really close.

1740
01:36:11,481 --> 01:36:12,380
And I said,
how close?

1741
01:36:12,381 --> 01:36:15,890
He goes,
listen to go,

1742
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:17,000
whoa,
that's really close.

1743
01:36:17,001 --> 01:36:22,001
I go,
what are the numbers in the back of the 

1744
01:36:22,001 --> 01:36:22,001
helicopter?
And he goes,

1745
01:36:22,001 --> 01:36:22,160
there are no numbers as a black hawk 
helicopter.

1746
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:27,600
And I went,
oh my gosh now just because it was very 

1747
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,911
new in the program with.
Because when you have an antidote to a 

1748
01:36:31,071 --> 01:36:34,010
weapon than it can be weaponized by 
terrorists.

1749
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:36,980
So they didn't know who.
Not everybody in the government knew who

1750
01:36:36,981 --> 01:36:41,981
I was.
Even though I was working with project 

1751
01:36:41,981 --> 01:36:44,111
biodefense,
I was still sort of an unknown entity 

1752
01:36:44,111 --> 01:36:46,370
and I filed a patent application on 
this.

1753
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,160
And so I told my manager,
okay,

1754
01:36:49,161 --> 01:36:50,150
shut down the business.

1755
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:52,910
Give everybody cultures of this 
mushroom,

1756
01:36:52,911 --> 01:36:57,911
which was [inaudible].
I don't want to know who has them shut 

1757
01:36:57,911 --> 01:36:57,911
down the business.
Everyone spread.

1758
01:36:57,911 --> 01:36:59,930
So we decentralized ourselves at target.
But hold on,

1759
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:02,120
let me stop you right there.
So you're in Canada,

1760
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:04,580
Canada,
and the United States.

1761
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:08,150
In Washington state and the helicopters 
are flying over your lab,

1762
01:37:08,151 --> 01:37:09,560
what happens then?
Well,

1763
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:12,710
they were trying.
They were spooking us do it on purpose.

1764
01:37:12,711 --> 01:37:17,711
They were doing the purpose.
They were hovering to let you know 

1765
01:37:17,711 --> 01:37:17,711
they're there.
I don't know what they were doing.

1766
01:37:17,711 --> 01:37:19,520
I mean there are treetop level right 
over the frigging laboratory.

1767
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:23,210
So I had everyone go in their car.
They asked everyone to go in their car,

1768
01:37:23,211 --> 01:37:26,120
shut down the business immediately and 
decentralize us as a target.

1769
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:31,570
So later on when I came back,
I called the people in the defense 

1770
01:37:31,570 --> 01:37:33,350
department saying,
what the hell's going on here?

1771
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:34,970
And they go,
oh geez,

1772
01:37:34,971 --> 01:37:39,971
you know,
sometimes the left hand doesn't talk to 

1773
01:37:39,971 --> 01:37:39,971
her.
Right?

1774
01:37:39,971 --> 01:37:39,971
Or sorry.
So eventually.

1775
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:43,550
So how did they find out that you just 
from your patent filing with the patent?

1776
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:48,700
I filed the patent and it disappeared.
Most patent applications when you file 

1777
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:53,001
them show up in the us patent homepage,
within a year or two I filed this patent

1778
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:57,060
and four or five years later it still 
had not been published.

1779
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:02,600
So I get a hold of my patent attorney 
who gets ahold of the patent office and 

1780
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:05,901
the us department of defense considered 
it to be an act national security,

1781
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:10,620
so they quarantined my patent,
took it out of the patent office,

1782
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:15,920
and they so it could not be seen by 
potential terrorists because then it 

1783
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:20,600
could have an antidote to smallpox.
So I had to do an inner government,

1784
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:25,350
a governmental agency,
trace to recall the patent from dod,

1785
01:38:25,351 --> 01:38:30,351
that meetings they let out to be 
released because it was a natural 

1786
01:38:30,351 --> 01:38:30,351
product.

1787
01:38:30,351 --> 01:38:34,640
And so the patent then was put back into
the patent application queue and it was 

1788
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:37,950
approved in 2013.
I filed it in 2004.

1789
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:44,060
So we have now done work at the 
university of Mississippi school of 

1790
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:47,571
pharmacy.
We've isolated two novel anti smallpox 

1791
01:38:47,571 --> 01:38:50,571
molecules.
We also have done work at the 

1792
01:38:50,571 --> 01:38:53,360
tuberculosis research institute with Dr.
Scott France plow and university of 

1793
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,020
Illinois chicago.
We've identified a new anti-tuberculosis

1794
01:38:55,190 --> 01:39:00,190
molecule,
a garicoitz and [inaudible] time in 

1795
01:39:00,190 --> 01:39:02,400
greek culture was used for treating 
consumption later thought to be known as

1796
01:39:02,401 --> 01:39:07,401
tuberculosis.
We have found that extracts of this 

1797
01:39:07,401 --> 01:39:08,700
mushroom are dually active against 
bacteria and viruses.

1798
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:13,530
Most people who die from viral pneumonia
actually die from bacterial pneumonia.

1799
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:18,740
They get a viral infection.
Their immune system over amps and 

1800
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:19,590
response.
You get flood,

1801
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:24,650
lungs get flooded with liquid bacteria 
setup and bacterial pneumonia usually 

1802
01:39:24,650 --> 01:39:27,060
kills people who actually get a flu 
virus.

1803
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:32,060
They die from bacterial pneumonia,
so to find a natural product that's 

1804
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:33,030
dually active against viruses and 
bacteria is medically significant.

1805
01:39:33,031 --> 01:39:38,031
So there's a good argument for natural 
products because you have a consortium 

1806
01:39:38,031 --> 01:39:41,420
of protective agents that are living in 
this soup of this extract that can help 

1807
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:46,480
help protect you.
So this has now led onto our discovering

1808
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:50,760
molecules active against hpv.
The human papilloma virus.

1809
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:56,780
Seventy percent or more of women have 
hpv controversial vaccine.

1810
01:39:57,451 --> 01:39:59,560
Apparently it's very dangerous.
Well,

1811
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:02,680
I'm not anti vaccination,
but I'm not either,

1812
01:40:02,681 --> 01:40:07,470
but I'm curious why they don't recommend
the vaccine after the age of 24.

1813
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:13,640
I can't wrap my mind around.
I think they're just trying to prevent 

1814
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:16,191
infection from sexually active kids 
while you're sexually active after the 

1815
01:40:16,191 --> 01:40:16,380
age of 24.
So why?

1816
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:18,390
When they're sexually active before 
then,

1817
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:23,870
but if you were didn't have the 
infection before 24 and you're still 

1818
01:40:23,870 --> 01:40:27,530
active at the age of 24,
why wouldn't they recommend the 

1819
01:40:27,530 --> 01:40:27,530
vaccination after the age of 24?

1820
01:40:27,530 --> 01:40:32,240
Maybe there's a good medical recommended
post 24 hours that we were just 24 also 

1821
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:35,850
post 24.
They don't recommend it because they 

1822
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:35,850
think maybe you already have it.
I don't know the answer to that.

1823
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:40,430
That's bizarre.
I've never been able to get someone to 

1824
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:41,910
explain to me why is it the case?
Mushrooms can suppress the expression of

1825
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:45,360
this is that we were saying the 
ingredients within the mushrooms.

1826
01:40:45,361 --> 01:40:50,361
We have found five molecules 
authenticated by nih virology as being 

1827
01:40:50,361 --> 01:40:52,560
potently active against hpv.
Which mushrooms,

1828
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:58,220
uh,
all the poly pores that I have been 

1829
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,790
talking about,
a ratio air-con,

1830
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:04,690
amadu are likely,
we don't,

1831
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:09,720
I can't say de facto,
all of them to have varying amounts of 

1832
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:13,441
these constituents.
So these mushroom extracts are huge 

1833
01:41:13,441 --> 01:41:16,441
consortium of antiviral and 
antibacterial compounds.

1834
01:41:16,811 --> 01:41:18,130
Now,
as I mentioned,

1835
01:41:18,131 --> 01:41:23,131
this maybe 5 million species of fungi is
about 150,000

1836
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:26,680
species of mushrooms we've identified 
around 14,000,

1837
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:32,220
so think of from a just from 
experientials evidence over thousands of

1838
01:41:32,350 --> 01:41:33,580
years of human experimentation.

1839
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:37,750
It'd be like you went into a library and
there's 14,000

1840
01:41:37,751 --> 01:41:40,030
books in your library,
14,000

1841
01:41:40,031 --> 01:41:43,210
species,
and our ancestors started selecting each

1842
01:41:43,211 --> 01:41:48,211
of these species and testing them.
We've narrowed the field down to about 

1843
01:41:48,211 --> 01:41:52,081
200 species of which 50 species are 
superstars that have no adverse effects 

1844
01:41:53,291 --> 01:41:58,291
to human ingestion that had been used 
for a very long period of time and 

1845
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:03,900
within that set of 50 species we're 
finding these mushrooms which have 

1846
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:08,100
tremendous potential health benefit.
So this is why I'm so excited in the 

1847
01:42:10,931 --> 01:42:14,260
field of mycology is we have 
translational science.

1848
01:42:14,261 --> 01:42:19,261
We have applied mycology,
and I think based on what we've 

1849
01:42:19,961 --> 01:42:24,961
discovered,
we can make the argument that we should 

1850
01:42:24,961 --> 01:42:26,710
save the old growth forest as a matter 
of national defense.

1851
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:31,570
Our fungal genomes are essential for our
future and present survival.

1852
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:35,440
The more we eliminate these landscapes 
of biodiversity,

1853
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:39,190
the more really losing potential agents 
that can fight disease,

1854
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:44,470
and so this is something that I think we
can build a bridge between conservatives

1855
01:42:44,471 --> 01:42:48,520
and liberals because osama bin ladin and
have access to an old growth forest.

1856
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:53,790
We did and we do,
and I think this is really just 

1857
01:42:53,790 --> 01:42:58,471
indicative of many other things that we 
can discover if we pay attention to the 

1858
01:42:59,141 --> 01:43:03,580
vast genomic resources we have in the 
biodiversity of the ecosystems that are,

1859
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:04,810
that are still intact.

1860
01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:10,190
Now.
Do you recommend for personal 

1861
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:11,160
consumpTion any particular mushrooms,
any particular supplements?

1862
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:16,770
I in terms of recommend recommendations 
for gourmet mushrooms,

1863
01:43:16,771 --> 01:43:21,771
I can make those.
In terms of recommendations for 

1864
01:43:21,771 --> 01:43:21,810
medicinal mushrooms,
I cannot make recommendations.

1865
01:43:21,811 --> 01:43:26,040
I'm legally tied by the fda.
I cannot make a recommendation.

1866
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:29,780
Can you recommend a website that perhaps
would recommend?

1867
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:36,760
Well,
I do recommend eating gourmet mushrooms 

1868
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,530
for,
for just for a sheet talky,

1869
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:41,570
lion's mane,
my talky and reishi and chaga,

1870
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,350
and these all have medical benefits as 
well.

1871
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:44,930
These all,

1872
01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:49,930
I don't know the difference between a 
gourmet and a medicinal medicinal 

1873
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:49,930
mushrooms.
Mushrooms,

1874
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:53,750
mushrooms are medicinal.
Mushrooms are medicinal.

1875
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:58,160
Mushrooms are very,
very medicinal.

1876
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:03,370
The big,
the big stars right now by far are 

1877
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:04,220
reishi,
chaga,

1878
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:06,440
and lion's mane.
What about portabella?

1879
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:08,390
They taste too good.
They can't be that good for you.

1880
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:11,060
Poor bellows,
have a problem.

1881
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:16,090
I knew all mush.
All mushrooms should be cooked and 

1882
01:44:16,401 --> 01:44:20,300
portobellos in particular should be 
cooked at high temperatures.

1883
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:25,630
Why?
There is a unfortunate google compound 

1884
01:44:25,630 --> 01:44:26,740
called at garret.
Uh,

1885
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:31,800
garret teens are hydrazine's that are 
heat unstable.

1886
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,310
So the good news is you should cook 
them.

1887
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:38,660
And if you cook them well,
then those mushrooms are not a problem.

1888
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:44,290
If you don't cook them well,
then these hydrazine's are potentially 

1889
01:44:44,481 --> 01:44:46,070
problematic.
Now,

1890
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:51,160
nature's a numbers game.
So there are beneficial compounds that 

1891
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,350
in some balance may outweigh the 
negative effects of the hydrazine's,

1892
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:58,010
the garrett teens in these mushrooms.
But that jury is still out.

1893
01:44:58,011 --> 01:45:01,910
So what are the negative benefits or the
negative affects of this?

1894
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:08,290
This is an explosive area of 
conversation and puts my life in danger.

1895
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:13,820
So I reserve the right not to answer a 
question.

1896
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,700
Whoa.
I didn't expect that.

1897
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:20,390
It puts your life in danger.
Talking about portabella mushrooms.

1898
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:25,850
He's looking at me silently.
I will respectfully move on.

1899
01:45:25,851 --> 01:45:28,730
Thank you.
So anybody who's interested,

1900
01:45:28,731 --> 01:45:33,150
just google that and get back to me 
next.

1901
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:38,200
I'm going to have a guy who was the same
height as paul and he's going to have a 

1902
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:43,181
mask on and we're going to have some 
sort of electric box that distorts his 

1903
01:45:43,181 --> 01:45:44,080
voice.
No,

1904
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:49,280
but the good news there is lots of 
mushrooms that have tremendous benefit 

1905
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:54,860
and compounds inside of portabella 
mushrooms that are very beneficial and 

1906
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:59,300
in fact there is a positive study with 
some breast cancer patients.

1907
01:45:59,450 --> 01:46:04,310
Breast cancer study showing that that 
button mushrooms can confer benefits.

1908
01:46:04,311 --> 01:46:06,300
So there that you know,
we.

1909
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:09,710
We were funded by nih with a two point 
$2,000,000

1910
01:46:09,711 --> 01:46:14,711
for a breast cancer clinical study on 
Turkey tail mushrooms and Turkey tail 

1911
01:46:14,711 --> 01:46:17,810
mushrooms are fantastic as adjuncts to 
conventional therapy.

1912
01:46:19,190 --> 01:46:24,190
The clinical study that was conducted 
funded by nih and the university of 

1913
01:46:25,011 --> 01:46:30,011
Minnesota medical school and medical 
college showed a dose response curve 

1914
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:35,050
specifically in supporting the immune 
system by taking Turkey tail mushrooms 

1915
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:37,100
and the more you talk,
the more benefit there was.

1916
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:42,800
I have a ted med talk that's very 
popular in front of 800 physicians where

1917
01:46:43,641 --> 01:46:48,641
my mother,
who is challenged with advanced stage 

1918
01:46:48,641 --> 01:46:48,860
four breast cancer,
who is now 90,

1919
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:53,930
almost 93 years of age.
She had advanced stage four breast 

1920
01:46:53,930 --> 01:46:57,180
cancer when she was 84 years of age,
given less than a few months to live,

1921
01:46:57,870 --> 01:47:01,110
and she had metastasized tumors all over
her body.

1922
01:47:01,170 --> 01:47:06,170
Her breast was erupting with a very,
very bad carcinoma and she is alive well

1923
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:11,500
and fully recovered today.
She did.

1924
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:16,580
She had chemotherapy using herceptin and
little short time taxol.

1925
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:21,740
She had a very bad reaction to taxol,
but there's a scientific articles now 

1926
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:25,560
been published saying that showing that 
Turkey tail mushroom constituents help 

1927
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:27,990
conventional therapies like 
chemotherapy,

1928
01:47:27,991 --> 01:47:30,360
the herceptin and making herceptin work 
better.

1929
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:35,810
So there's a nice blending of 
integrative medicine with using natural 

1930
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:40,401
products with conventional medicine.
I will never be say that you should not 

1931
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:42,330
consult a physician.

1932
01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:44,610
I will never say that you should not use
conventional medicine.

1933
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:48,960
You should is the state of the art of 
science is right there,

1934
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:54,200
but the state of the arts and sciences 
that we can upregulate immunity with 

1935
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:57,831
these mushrooms and that's your front 
line of defense and then the other 

1936
01:47:57,831 --> 01:48:00,990
conventional therapies that are being 
practiced now combine very,

1937
01:48:00,991 --> 01:48:05,610
very nicely according to many physicians
and reports showing that the combination

1938
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:10,630
of Turkey tail mushrooms in combination 
with conventional therapy can have a 

1939
01:48:11,371 --> 01:48:15,360
significant difference in improving your
immunological defense.

1940
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:20,770
No,
I absolutely agree with you that 

1941
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:23,240
conventional treatments are state of the
art and this is state of the art 

1942
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:27,411
science.
When you're talking about dealing with 

1943
01:48:27,411 --> 01:48:29,331
cancer,
you should deal with oncologists that 

1944
01:48:29,331 --> 01:48:30,720
are at the cutting edge,
but they're not state of the art when it

1945
01:48:30,721 --> 01:48:35,070
comes to the preventing of these things 
and that that's a giant issue that a lot

1946
01:48:35,071 --> 01:48:37,110
of people have when it comes to 
nutrition,

1947
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:40,500
lifestyle,
mitigating stress,

1948
01:48:40,501 --> 01:48:44,700
all the various factors that contribute 
to a bunch of different health ailments.

1949
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:50,060
Do you think that mushrooms could also 
play a factor in that as well?

1950
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:52,650
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

1951
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:57,330
There's a great epidemiological study 
that came out of Japan and dr.

1952
01:48:57,770 --> 01:49:02,770
Valois was a epidemiologist that worked 
for the national cancer center in tokyo 

1953
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:08,900
and they noticed and surveying people in
Japan in the 19 sixties,

1954
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:12,030
early 19 seventies,
there was a dearth,

1955
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:16,830
a drop in the overall cancer rate and 
this one population in nagano prefecture

1956
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:22,100
in Japan,
so he was sent there by the national 

1957
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:24,981
cancer center of tokyo,
by the government to say what are these 

1958
01:49:24,981 --> 01:49:28,101
people doing?
And this one cluster of villages where 

1959
01:49:28,101 --> 01:49:28,740
they have statistically significant less
cancer rates.

1960
01:49:28,741 --> 01:49:31,260
We're talking about 30 percent less than
the national average.

1961
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:35,610
And after exhaustive study he found that
they were eating enoki mushrooms.

1962
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:40,790
A lot of them,
because the enoki mushrooms are really 

1963
01:49:40,790 --> 01:49:40,790
thin ones,
like really tall stems.

1964
01:49:40,790 --> 01:49:41,280
You can buy them in the store.
Well,

1965
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:46,340
the font,
there was a big farming centers for 

1966
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:47,070
enoki mushrooms there and then the 
blemished ones as us.

1967
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:48,100
Roberta,
there's no.

1968
01:49:48,110 --> 01:49:53,110
We don't sell to the public,
the ones that have little spots on them 

1969
01:49:53,110 --> 01:49:53,920
or are deformed,
but they are given to the workers and so

1970
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:58,921
their workers and then their families 
eat a higher per capita consumption of 

1971
01:49:58,921 --> 01:50:00,640
enoki mushrooms than the other residents
of Japan.

1972
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:06,030
So they found that specifically the 
consumption of enoki mushrooms resulted 

1973
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:11,380
in a reduction of cancer across the 
board of all cancers.

1974
01:50:11,381 --> 01:50:14,440
Statistically significant,
I think over 220,000

1975
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:19,441
people in this epidemiological survey.
I've written about 10 articles for the 

1976
01:50:19,441 --> 01:50:21,220
huffington post and you can google 
stamets,

1977
01:50:21,221 --> 01:50:25,060
huffington post and enoki mushrooms and 
see all the citations on enoki mushrooms

1978
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:29,950
on lion's mane on [inaudible].
All these mushrooms I'm talking about,

1979
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:32,770
they're all peer reviewed past 
physicians.

1980
01:50:32,771 --> 01:50:36,280
They're all very short articles,
but they summarize a lot of the research

1981
01:50:36,281 --> 01:50:37,030
that I'm talking about.

1982
01:50:37,470 --> 01:50:38,930
That's amazing.
Um,

1983
01:50:38,970 --> 01:50:43,970
what,
what do you know about the quarter eps 

1984
01:50:43,970 --> 01:50:43,970
mushroom?

1985
01:50:43,970 --> 01:50:44,560
I know a fair amount about cortisol.

1986
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:47,790
Yeah.
I'm fascinated for two reasons.

1987
01:50:47,791 --> 01:50:51,120
One,
because of a supplement that I take that

1988
01:50:51,121 --> 01:50:54,210
my company makes called true tech sport,
sorry for the name.

1989
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:59,340
My apologies in advance,
buT it's based on athletic performance,

1990
01:50:59,341 --> 01:51:04,341
but the shroom tech is based on the 
quarter steps and be 12 and a bunch of 

1991
01:51:04,741 --> 01:51:09,741
different adaptogens.
And the idea being that when you take 

1992
01:51:09,741 --> 01:51:10,200
that it benefits athletic performance,
benefits,

1993
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,970
endurance and oxygen utilization.
And apparently they discoVered this from

1994
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:20,200
what?
It's a weird one because they grow it 

1995
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:20,200
on,
on a caterpillar,

1996
01:51:20,330 --> 01:51:21,510
d,
do you know about all that?

1997
01:51:21,570 --> 01:51:26,570
Yeah.
Cordyceps is now has been split into 

1998
01:51:26,570 --> 01:51:26,570
several different gentlemen.
Yeah,

1999
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:31,790
bring up.
The other one is the one that explodes 

2000
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:31,790
on ants.

2001
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:31,790
Yeah,
there's a.

2002
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:36,540
There's a quarter steps.
Sinensis now known as [inaudible] 

2003
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:40,870
sinensis.
cordyceps has about 500 species in it.

2004
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:45,550
It's been a very complicated taxonomy 
because when researchers would go in the

2005
01:51:45,551 --> 01:51:50,551
himalayas and they find these 
caterpillars for the quarter system 

2006
01:51:50,551 --> 01:51:52,510
mushrooms coming out of it,
very good scientists,

2007
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:54,850
and they did this.
What I would do,

2008
01:51:54,851 --> 01:51:59,851
they would take it in a laboratory.
They would break it open and take a 

2009
01:51:59,851 --> 01:51:59,851
piece of tissue from the inside.
They.

2010
01:51:59,851 --> 01:52:04,051
It's called cloning.
So you just capture their genetic 

2011
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:04,051
material.
You grow out the culture.

2012
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:07,210
Very confusing because there's five 
different fungi.

2013
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:11,050
They're called anna morphs.
Cordyceps is a dimorphic fungus.

2014
01:52:11,051 --> 01:52:16,051
what that means as two forms,
it's got a mold state and it's got a 

2015
01:52:16,051 --> 01:52:19,801
mushroom state.
The mushroom state comes up like a 

2016
01:52:19,801 --> 01:52:19,801
little club,
looked like your finger would go,

2017
01:52:19,801 --> 01:52:19,900
orange,
orange,

2018
01:52:19,901 --> 01:52:24,901
little finger coming up out of the 
ground so you can find that jamie and 

2019
01:52:24,901 --> 01:52:24,901
the.

2020
01:52:25,010 --> 01:52:27,340
Yeah,
so is this a expired caterpillar?

2021
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:32,080
I can't actually see the species there,
but it looked like they're beetles,

2022
01:52:34,210 --> 01:52:36,000
so there's a number of core set of 
species.

2023
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:41,920
So when there was a lot of scientific 
dispute on what the true anamorphic,

2024
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:48,030
now it's two sides of the same coin.
You see the quarter and then you clone 

2025
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:51,620
it and you get this mold growing and 
then people will grow up the mold.

2026
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:56,480
Well now we know there are several 
species of molds that are growing inside

2027
01:52:56,481 --> 01:53:01,481
the caterpillar,
so the true cost us a quarter step 

2028
01:53:01,481 --> 01:53:04,340
sinensis is now identified as her tele 
condensed sinensis.

2029
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:09,760
That's the true one facility on my cs 
and monetarism and all these other ones 

2030
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:12,500
are not considered to be the true 
organism.

2031
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:17,980
They're chasing the other quarters steps
mold inside of the mushroom.

2032
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:19,230
Whoa.
Well,

2033
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:26,640
I can't keep up with you.
This isn't going to be one that I'm 

2034
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:26,640
going to go over many,
many,

2035
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:28,070
many,
many poly culture,

2036
01:53:28,390 --> 01:53:32,000
poly call polyculture with several 
different entimopathogenic fungi.

2037
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,220
These are fungi that kill insects,
so I mean this is very,

2038
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:40,630
very disruptive because all of the fda 
and the labeling and how do you label 

2039
01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:44,411
this or what do you do and who's right 
and who's wrong and how do you get the 

2040
01:53:44,411 --> 01:53:46,730
labeling to conform with the current 
taxonomy based on dna research.

2041
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:50,960
The good news is based on the best of my
knowledge,

2042
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:55,130
the several of these companies that are 
selling these quarter steps,

2043
01:53:55,131 --> 01:53:58,580
they anam wharfs even though they may 
not be the true cordyceps sinensis.

2044
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:03,820
Those also confer benefits so you can 
argue in a sense about different 

2045
01:54:05,481 --> 01:54:08,150
species.
The problem with this is there's no less

2046
01:54:08,151 --> 01:54:11,460
than a thousand peer reviewed articles 
on quarter acep,

2047
01:54:11,461 --> 01:54:16,461
sinensis and no one or hardly anyone.
No one knows what species they were 

2048
01:54:17,091 --> 01:54:19,220
actually growing because if we don't 
know which,

2049
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:24,250
which of these animal wars there were 
actually growing was this recent 

2050
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:24,250
information is all very recent.

2051
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:27,080
All in the past four or five years,
and especially in the past two years,

2052
01:54:27,081 --> 01:54:32,081
so it's taxonomy is in flux because the 
dna pcr amplification in the region of 

2053
01:54:34,791 --> 01:54:39,110
dna that they've chosen to amplify there
are idiosyncratic to the species.

2054
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:44,350
Now that story has changed.
Whole genome sequencing is really the 

2055
01:54:44,350 --> 01:54:47,741
only way to go about this where they 
sequence the entire genome and so there 

2056
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,000
was a lot of elasticity or plasticity in
the expression of dna.

2057
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,820
Now going back,
what we've been talking about,

2058
01:54:55,821 --> 01:54:58,310
this whole interview,
epa,

2059
01:54:58,311 --> 01:54:59,570
genesis,
epa,

2060
01:54:59,571 --> 01:55:04,571
genesis,
is the an environmental stimulus has a 

2061
01:55:04,571 --> 01:55:08,471
selective influence on the genomic 
expression of the individual species 

2062
01:55:08,781 --> 01:55:13,781
yourself and so you up regulate or turn 
on genes that are otherwise quote 

2063
01:55:13,781 --> 01:55:18,701
unquote asleep.
And so what we're seeing now is that 

2064
01:55:18,701 --> 01:55:23,680
epigenetic influences can cause 
different dna expressions and so what 

2065
01:55:26,001 --> 01:55:31,001
was considered to be conformity of a 
species in dna types before like 99 

2066
01:55:31,001 --> 01:55:31,070
percent.

2067
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:31,910
And that was thought that,
oh,

2068
01:55:31,911 --> 01:55:34,820
we're the same species.
Now we know that's highly inaccurate.

2069
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:40,120
So what was accurate a few years ago is 
considered to be highly inaccurate 

2070
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:41,900
today.
The science is changing very,

2071
01:55:41,901 --> 01:55:44,550
very rapidly and the regulatory 
environment cannot catch up,

2072
01:55:45,030 --> 01:55:49,020
so it doesn't really matter except for 
the following,

2073
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:51,210
and this is I do make a recommendation 
here,

2074
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:56,750
make sure your mushrooms or whatever 
products you're consuming are certified 

2075
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:58,590
organic and please don't buy them from 
China.

2076
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:02,610
Anyone who's been to China,
I've been to China several times.

2077
01:56:02,611 --> 01:56:07,611
The amount of massive air pollution 
there is horrific and the chain of 

2078
01:56:07,611 --> 01:56:09,180
custody as we call it,
where are these people are getting their

2079
01:56:09,181 --> 01:56:11,670
mushrooms because they had mixed 
oftentimes distributors,

2080
01:56:11,671 --> 01:56:15,000
mixed suppliers and as a form of quote 
unquote russian roulette.

2081
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:20,360
We've done analyses on chinese sourced 
mushrooms and they've had up to 2100 

2082
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:23,670
parts per million of lead where two or 
three capsules is toxic.

2083
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:28,970
So why would you take a medicinal 
mushroom that's contaminated with heavy 

2084
01:56:28,970 --> 01:56:31,821
metals and pesticides?
You're trying to improve your immune 

2085
01:56:31,821 --> 01:56:31,920
system at the same time.
You're sabotaging your immune system,

2086
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:36,240
so getting mushrooms from clean 
environments is critically important.

2087
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:41,480
Unfortunately,
because the usda organic program they 

2088
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:45,111
can borrow from the organic programs of 
China is still say they're certified 

2089
01:56:45,111 --> 01:56:49,461
organic,
so you really need to buy us grown 

2090
01:56:49,461 --> 01:56:52,440
certified organic mushrooms that have a 
clear chain of custody and hopefully one

2091
01:56:52,441 --> 01:56:57,441
that is from a reputable supplier or 
scientist and not somebody who's just 

2092
01:56:57,441 --> 01:56:58,440
trying to make money.
There's a lot of opportunistic companies

2093
01:56:58,441 --> 01:57:02,280
right now who are just trying to exploit
and ride the bandwagon of the popularity

2094
01:57:02,281 --> 01:57:07,281
of medicinal mushrooms without really 
having done their homework or without 

2095
01:57:07,281 --> 01:57:10,980
fully informing the public that their 
mushrooms are actually coming from China

2096
01:57:10,981 --> 01:57:14,700
when they are not.
What is the strain of cordyceps mushroom

2097
01:57:14,701 --> 01:57:18,240
that erupts,
that infects ants,

2098
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:20,220
kills them,
sprouts out of them,

2099
01:57:20,221 --> 01:57:25,221
and then explodes and infects the ants 
near them and other ants will drag that 

2100
01:57:25,221 --> 01:57:28,380
ant knowing that it's infected deep,
deep away into the forest,

2101
01:57:28,830 --> 01:57:30,260
away from the column just quarter.

2102
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:33,110
Lord dei up on the screen there,
pulled up.

2103
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:38,270
We of course step laurie dei,
you lateralis is another one of these 

2104
01:57:38,281 --> 01:57:41,670
zombie movies he'd been saying have been
based on cordyceps and next.

2105
01:57:41,671 --> 01:57:46,560
I was actUally,
I was a character in hannibal lecter.

2106
01:57:46,890 --> 01:57:47,720
You were?
Yeah,

2107
01:57:47,730 --> 01:57:52,730
in the series.
I think it's number five and and l I 

2108
01:57:52,801 --> 01:57:57,570
think elvin stamets.
Was this anesthesiologist gave your last

2109
01:57:57,571 --> 01:57:58,220
name?
Yeah,

2110
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:00,210
use my last name and they just call you 
paul.

2111
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:03,170
Well they do on star trek.
I'm a character instructor.

2112
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:05,580
They actually call me paul stamets on 
star trek,

2113
01:58:07,590 --> 01:58:10,920
but hannibal lecter that series.
I let people write me,

2114
01:58:10,921 --> 01:58:11,460
said,
oh my gosh,

2115
01:58:11,461 --> 01:58:16,461
you're this evil doctor who overdoses 
his patients with drugs and then puts 

2116
01:58:17,911 --> 01:58:22,911
them in the backyard and then inoculates
with mushrooms just like cordyceps 

2117
01:58:22,911 --> 01:58:27,650
mushrooms growing in the backyard.
And some of the star trek people called 

2118
01:58:27,650 --> 01:58:27,900
me up in august of 2016.

2119
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:31,220
I'm talking to them.
They cbs set it up.

2120
01:58:31,221 --> 01:58:33,100
They have to talk to you.
They saw my ted talk and,

2121
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:34,980
and they said,
paul,

2122
01:58:34,981 --> 01:58:37,350
we're the writers of the star trek 
discovery series.

2123
01:58:37,351 --> 01:58:38,730
We're kind of stuck,
you know,

2124
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:41,770
we want to talk to you.
We saw your ted talk really interested.

2125
01:58:41,771 --> 01:58:42,460
And I go,
wait a second,

2126
01:58:42,461 --> 01:58:44,170
are you the one who put me in hannibal 
lecter?

2127
01:58:44,171 --> 01:58:44,770
It goes,
yeah.

2128
01:58:44,771 --> 01:58:45,210
And I go,
well,

2129
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:47,710
let's get it right this time,
you know.

2130
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:49,600
so I said,
okay.

2131
01:58:49,601 --> 01:58:50,800
I said,
foolishly,

2132
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:53,440
or maybe to my benefit,
foolishly,

2133
01:58:53,441 --> 01:58:55,330
I said,
turn on your tape recorder,

2134
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:58,990
give me the general idea,
let me run with it.

2135
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:00,010
And they said,
okay,

2136
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:05,160
go for it.
There's six of them I guess in the 

2137
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:05,160
conference call.
foolishly,

2138
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:05,590
I said,
I'm a star trek fan,

2139
01:59:05,591 --> 01:59:08,890
which is not foolish,
but I want no money for these ideas.

2140
01:59:08,890 --> 01:59:13,890
I give you all my intellectual property.
I want science fiction to predict 

2141
01:59:13,890 --> 01:59:13,890
science.
Fact,

2142
01:59:13,890 --> 01:59:18,450
the great thing about star trek is the 
flip phone and the ipad came out and 

2143
01:59:18,450 --> 01:59:20,320
start truck and then it became reality.
I said,

2144
01:59:20,321 --> 01:59:23,740
so you have a unique opportunity here of
forming our future.

2145
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:29,280
Let's collaborate to create a future 
that's better for our future 

2146
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:32,941
generations,
by inspiring students and young people 

2147
01:59:32,941 --> 01:59:37,350
to get excited about the science so they
can help populate the universities to 

2148
01:59:37,350 --> 01:59:40,000
create the inventions that can help save
this planet.

2149
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:45,300
That's in jeopardy.
And so I ran with the star trek theme 

2150
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:49,470
and we just saw the last episode last 
night and astrobiologist paul stamets is

2151
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:53,410
using the mycelium spore drive.
It is become,

2152
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:56,800
I couldn't believe it.
We're watching this thing and star trek,

2153
01:59:56,801 --> 02:00:01,801
the main theme of star trek is based on 
mycelium and the concepts that I gave 

2154
02:00:01,801 --> 02:00:01,801
them.

2155
02:00:01,801 --> 02:00:03,850
They've elaborated this six ways to 
sunday,

2156
02:00:03,851 --> 02:00:07,000
so they've really taken it misses as 
some sort of a propulsion system.

2157
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:10,480
It's a system.
Because in my ted talk,

2158
02:00:10,481 --> 02:00:12,520
and I've been talking about this a long 
time about networks,

2159
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:15,550
we have the mycelial network,
we have the computer internet,

2160
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:17,860
we have the neurological network in our 
brains.

2161
02:00:18,130 --> 02:00:21,370
And the ordination of dark matter 
conforms to string theory.

2162
02:00:21,580 --> 02:00:26,050
So these are three archetypes,
the same archetype,

2163
02:00:26,380 --> 02:00:31,380
the same dimensional structures stacked 
on top of each other and nature builds 

2164
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:35,881
upon its prior successes.
So networks reward themselves by 

2165
02:00:36,581 --> 02:00:38,950
surviving.
And it was from catastrophic.

2166
02:00:39,590 --> 02:00:43,150
So I said I'm still bound by 
confidentiality.

2167
02:00:43,151 --> 02:00:45,520
And there's an incredibly strict 
confidentiality agreement.

2168
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:48,280
I can only state which has been publicly
displayed,

2169
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:53,640
but the mycelium spore allows through 
the internet of nature,

2170
02:00:54,371 --> 02:00:59,371
you might say,
to be able to go into hyperspace 

2171
02:00:59,371 --> 02:01:01,090
immediately by tapping into the mycelial
archetype.

2172
02:01:01,550 --> 02:01:06,550
And so astro mycologist stamets now is 
plugging himself into the mycelial 

2173
02:01:06,550 --> 02:01:10,981
network of the universe and they can 
jump rather than using their standard 

2174
02:01:11,921 --> 02:01:16,921
hyper drives,
which you see them streaming across for 

2175
02:01:16,921 --> 02:01:16,921
hours from one part of the university,
the other,

2176
02:01:16,921 --> 02:01:19,210
they can show up immediately and then 
then disappear.

2177
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,610
Is this something that you think could 
actually be real?

2178
02:01:21,611 --> 02:01:23,130
One day?
I am.

2179
02:01:23,230 --> 02:01:23,800
Okay.
You're gonna.

2180
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:27,280
We're pushing the envelope,
pushing the envelope on this one,

2181
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:32,110
but if you look at the multiverse and 
I've had a.

2182
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:37,170
I've had a one or two in particular 
multiverse experiences where time and 

2183
02:01:40,101 --> 02:01:45,101
reality has changed in a way that I 
cannot explain it.

2184
02:01:45,201 --> 02:01:50,201
So what do you mean it's so incredibly 
profound that I still cannot wrap my 

2185
02:01:50,631 --> 02:01:52,050
mind around it.
And um,

2186
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:54,720
these are psilocybin experiences 
psilocybin experienced.

2187
02:01:54,721 --> 02:01:59,721
So I think the psilocybin experience 
might be a one will portal.

2188
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:04,960
And now I'm going to sound like terence 
mckenna vendoring in the to the 

2189
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:08,480
multiverse.
The idea that time can be bent,

2190
02:02:09,230 --> 02:02:14,230
that there are multiple universes 
occurring simultaneously in different 

2191
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:17,891
realities.
And I've had one experience in 

2192
02:02:17,891 --> 02:02:17,930
particular that is just unfathomable to 
me.

2193
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:24,220
I don't know how to explain it is okay.
I'll give it a shot.

2194
02:02:25,490 --> 02:02:29,090
You've already blown my mind this 50 
times today.

2195
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:31,730
This is a very deeply personal 
experience to me,

2196
02:02:31,731 --> 02:02:36,731
but I was um,
I was going to the evergreen state 

2197
02:02:36,731 --> 02:02:41,441
college.
I had the drug enforcement 

2198
02:02:41,441 --> 02:02:42,770
administration license.
My brother john went to yale university.

2199
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:48,940
He got a graduate scholarship in 
neurophysiology at the university of 

2200
02:02:48,940 --> 02:02:52,421
Washington.
He came out to Washington state and 

2201
02:02:52,421 --> 02:02:52,421
seattle.
I was living in olympia,

2202
02:02:52,421 --> 02:02:56,441
Washington.
I had a cabin up in the mountains near 

2203
02:02:56,441 --> 02:03:01,241
darrington,
Washington of the summertime for three 

2204
02:03:01,241 --> 02:03:01,241
years.
I set chokers.

2205
02:03:01,241 --> 02:03:01,670
I was a logger.

2206
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:05,960
I really believe in the school of hard 
knocks and the blending of academia with

2207
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:07,310
blue collar,
hard work.

2208
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:10,010
I love chopping wood.
I love running a chainsaw.

2209
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:14,900
I love hard labor.
I think it gives my mind some respite to

2210
02:03:14,901 --> 02:03:19,901
be able to think.
So I'm in this highly academic 

2211
02:03:19,901 --> 02:03:20,000
environment.
My brother john,

2212
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:23,230
he died unfortunately two years ago,
soon.

2213
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:28,440
See he got me involved in mushrooms,
so I'm going to segue and set the stage 

2214
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:32,831
here,
but I needed another two minutes to set 

2215
02:03:32,831 --> 02:03:34,571
the stage here.
So I'm growing up in a small town in 

2216
02:03:34,571 --> 02:03:37,841
Ohio called columbiana.
My brother john goes to is going to 

2217
02:03:37,841 --> 02:03:41,021
yale.
He comes back one day and it gives me a 

2218
02:03:41,021 --> 02:03:43,440
book that he usually for his class,
but he's on break and he said,

2219
02:03:43,441 --> 02:03:45,710
I am really fascinated and john went to 
Mexico.

2220
02:03:45,711 --> 02:03:50,711
Colombia,
came back with great stories of eating 

2221
02:03:50,711 --> 02:03:50,711
psilocybin mushrooms and he's my older 
brother.

2222
02:03:50,711 --> 02:03:53,480
I just idolized him and his book called 
older states of consciousness.

2223
02:03:54,050 --> 02:03:55,460
And so I said,
john,

2224
02:03:55,461 --> 02:03:56,450
can I borrow your book?
He said,

2225
02:03:56,451 --> 02:03:58,280
sure.
And he said,

2226
02:03:58,281 --> 02:04:03,281
but paul and you get back from my break 
is over and going back to college and 

2227
02:04:03,281 --> 02:04:03,800
this is part of our textbook.
So I borrowed his book,

2228
02:04:03,801 --> 02:04:07,010
altered states of consciousness.
I'm just fascinated reading it about all

2229
02:04:07,011 --> 02:04:08,660
these different ways of expanding your 
consciousness.

2230
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:13,160
I'm 14 years of age and so my best 
friend Ryan Snyder says,

2231
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:14,420
paul,
can I borrow your book?

2232
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:17,810
We're hanging together all the time,
and I go,

2233
02:04:17,811 --> 02:04:18,830
yeah,
but my idea back,

2234
02:04:19,350 --> 02:04:22,700
so he borrows my book and he doesn't 
return it a day.

2235
02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:23,990
SeverAl days,
pass a week,

2236
02:04:23,991 --> 02:04:25,070
pass,
two weeks pass.

2237
02:04:25,071 --> 02:04:30,071
My brother's coming back on break.
I said I needed that book ball back.

2238
02:04:30,141 --> 02:04:31,850
Paul and I go to ryan.
I go,

2239
02:04:31,851 --> 02:04:32,630
ryan,
I need my book.

2240
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:37,630
I need my book,
and ryan kept on avoiding the answering 

2241
02:04:37,630 --> 02:04:37,630
the subject and to finally give me my 
book,

2242
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:39,390
and ryan goes,
I can't give it to you,

2243
02:04:39,391 --> 02:04:40,350
paul.
I said,

2244
02:04:40,351 --> 02:04:45,351
why is my dad burned it?
I see your dad burned my brother's book.

2245
02:04:47,670 --> 02:04:49,620
I go,
wtf?

2246
02:04:49,621 --> 02:04:51,750
I didn't use this phrase back then.
I said,

2247
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:56,840
oh my god,
and I have a shout out to ryan snyder's 

2248
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:59,871
father because of that event.
It stimulated my interest in altered 

2249
02:05:00,361 --> 02:05:05,361
states of consciousness even more so 
that john goes to yale and it goes to 

2250
02:05:05,641 --> 02:05:09,210
the university of Washington.
I have this dea permit.

2251
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:12,510
I'm at the evergreen state college.
John calls me up and he says,

2252
02:05:12,511 --> 02:05:17,511
paul,
I think I found some psilocybin 

2253
02:05:17,511 --> 02:05:17,511
mushrooms.
John said,

2254
02:05:17,511 --> 02:05:21,531
you're really smart.
You've been collecting sloppy cubensis 

2255
02:05:21,531 --> 02:05:23,631
in Colombia and Mexico,
but this is much more complicated up 

2256
02:05:23,631 --> 02:05:23,631
here.
I said,

2257
02:05:23,631 --> 02:05:24,300
let me ask you a few questions.

2258
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:25,050
I said,
okay,

2259
02:05:25,051 --> 02:05:26,190
john,
can you take a spore print?

2260
02:05:26,230 --> 02:05:26,820
He goes,
yes,

2261
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:28,860
I go,
spores purple,

2262
02:05:28,861 --> 02:05:30,390
brown,
and he goes,

2263
02:05:30,391 --> 02:05:31,410
yes,
they are purple brown.

2264
02:05:31,411 --> 02:05:31,980
I go,
good.

2265
02:05:33,660 --> 02:05:36,450
John separable,
gelatinous pellicle,

2266
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:37,620
and he goes,
what's that?

2267
02:05:37,621 --> 02:05:38,070
And I go,
well,

2268
02:05:38,370 --> 02:05:40,320
break the cap.
These are growing on wood chips.

2269
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:43,140
Break the cap and separate the cap very 
slowly.

2270
02:05:43,141 --> 02:05:45,660
Do you see a little skin that's 
translucent?

2271
02:05:45,710 --> 02:05:46,740
And he breaks it and goes,
yeah,

2272
02:05:46,741 --> 02:05:49,320
I see that skin.
The john the growing in wood chips,

2273
02:05:49,321 --> 02:05:50,130
and he goes,
yes.

2274
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:52,590
I go,
are they turning bluish?

2275
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:53,490
He goes,
yes,

2276
02:05:53,491 --> 02:05:56,490
they're staining really bright blue go,
wow.

2277
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:57,600
I said,
john,

2278
02:05:57,810 --> 02:06:00,030
how many did you find?
He goes,

2279
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:03,930
you would not believe it is a huge 
amount.

2280
02:06:04,230 --> 02:06:05,180
I said,
wait.

2281
02:06:05,470 --> 02:06:06,860
I said,
paul,

2282
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:09,960
they're in a very sensitive place.
You better come up here right away.

2283
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:13,980
So I jumped in my car and I drove up 
from olympia to seattle about 60,

2284
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:14,730
70 miles.

2285
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:18,570
I get to his house and john's there and 
I go,

2286
02:06:18,571 --> 02:06:19,750
well,
where are we going to say,

2287
02:06:19,790 --> 02:06:24,790
well we need some grocery bags and let's
get on our bikes and let's go down 

2288
02:06:25,411 --> 02:06:26,010
there.
I go,

2289
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:30,270
why all the secrecy and the promise is,
well you'll see.

2290
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:34,920
And it was the end of boat street and 
right at the university of Washington,

2291
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:39,180
right off of university avenue.
There's boat street and we get there and

2292
02:06:39,181 --> 02:06:41,490
right across the street as a police 
substation.

2293
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:46,710
So we're there and it was an eruption of
this mushroom that had to be 10,000,

2294
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:48,000
30,000
mushrooms,

2295
02:06:48,001 --> 02:06:53,001
I don't know,
is about 50 feet by 30 feet with all 

2296
02:06:53,001 --> 02:06:56,110
been cultured wood chips.
There was an eruption that picked up 

2297
02:06:56,110 --> 02:06:57,420
trash and debris that picked up six 
inches,

2298
02:06:57,421 --> 02:06:59,910
was solid mushrooms there.
Mushrooms everywhere.

2299
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:05,120
To this day,
never seen so many mushrooms in one 

2300
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:07,491
concentrated area.
So we waited until the police cars went 

2301
02:07:07,491 --> 02:07:10,461
away and were kind of idling there.
And then the police cars will go away 

2302
02:07:10,461 --> 02:07:10,461
and from the substation.
And we'd start picking mushrooms,

2303
02:07:10,461 --> 02:07:15,201
picking mushrooms,
and we fill up a grocery bag or two and 

2304
02:07:15,201 --> 02:07:15,690
then the other students are walking by,
what are you doing?

2305
02:07:15,691 --> 02:07:16,230
Oh,
nothing.

2306
02:07:16,231 --> 02:07:21,231
You know?
And then we eventually got plenty for 

2307
02:07:21,231 --> 02:07:21,231
everybody.

2308
02:07:21,231 --> 02:07:25,780
So it was like pretty good.
Everyone's all hanging out as a little 

2309
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:25,780
group like at the bus stop,
right?

2310
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:26,800
We're not really waiting for the bus.
Right.

2311
02:07:26,810 --> 02:07:28,410
We're waiting for the police cars to go 
away.

2312
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:33,890
And then we picked all these mushrooms 
and so we got about eight or 10 grocery 

2313
02:07:33,890 --> 02:07:35,500
bags full of these mushrooms help as it 
turned out to be a new species of called

2314
02:07:35,501 --> 02:07:37,430
philosophy students.
See I'm named after him.

2315
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:39,340
No species,
new species,

2316
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:45,160
as in hadn't been discovered with had 
never been described in the scientific 

2317
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:48,961
literature and before.
So you picked a mushroom that no one 

2318
02:07:48,961 --> 02:07:50,560
knew existed but hadn't been.
Hadn't been described scientifically.

2319
02:07:50,590 --> 02:07:52,450
We had known about it for about three 
years,

2320
02:07:52,451 --> 02:07:57,451
but this is a largest eruption.
And from that collection became part of 

2321
02:07:57,940 --> 02:08:01,780
the type collection that anchored the 
species taxonomically.

2322
02:08:02,050 --> 02:08:07,050
So I think some of the specimens still 
exist in her barrier around the world 

2323
02:08:07,050 --> 02:08:07,780
because it's the reference standard.

2324
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:13,060
So we go back to the house and it's like
we gotta dry them,

2325
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:19,200
so we lay out newspapers and the whole,
the whole newspapers were just covered 

2326
02:08:20,531 --> 02:08:21,800
with mushrooms.
And,

2327
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:25,900
and so that night we just above four 
guys from yale,

2328
02:08:25,901 --> 02:08:29,540
all neurophysiology,
all scientists on scientist track them,

2329
02:08:30,670 --> 02:08:32,230
eat them.
And so,

2330
02:08:32,231 --> 02:08:34,100
I mean,
this is not very potent there.

2331
02:08:34,150 --> 02:08:39,080
One 10th the potency of cubensis.
So we made smoothies and uh,

2332
02:08:39,081 --> 02:08:42,010
oh my gosh,
talk about the gag reflex.

2333
02:08:42,011 --> 02:08:47,011
So we had to make these foods,
we have 50 of them in order to have a 

2334
02:08:47,011 --> 02:08:49,520
dose equivalent equivalent to westlaw 
speak.

2335
02:08:49,550 --> 02:08:51,190
Vince's would be.
So I knew that.

2336
02:08:51,191 --> 02:08:56,191
So we made these incredibly distasteful 
Milkshakes and we chugged them,

2337
02:08:56,320 --> 02:09:00,760
we drank them.
And then amazing experience.

2338
02:09:00,761 --> 02:09:02,800
I bonded with my brother,
it was beautiful.

2339
02:09:02,801 --> 02:09:04,840
And then you're peaking at the 
experience.

2340
02:09:04,841 --> 02:09:07,480
You look around and there's like tens of
thousands is modular.

2341
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:08,230
Like,
oh my gosh,

2342
02:09:09,490 --> 02:09:10,700
all for science.
Um,

2343
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:16,020
and so I go To bed and I'm laying in bed
in full blown experience.

2344
02:09:18,401 --> 02:09:23,401
And can barely sleep because all the 
colors are keeping me awake and my mind 

2345
02:09:23,981 --> 02:09:28,981
is racing and then I have a lucid dream 
and I'm dreaming and I wake up and I go 

2346
02:09:31,991 --> 02:09:32,980
downstairs,
I go,

2347
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:36,010
I had this crazy dream.
What's your dream?

2348
02:09:36,011 --> 02:09:41,011
And I said,
I saw thousands of cattle dead baking in

2349
02:09:41,321 --> 02:09:43,390
the sun.
I said,

2350
02:09:44,230 --> 02:09:45,700
I think there's going to be a nuclear 
war,

2351
02:09:46,110 --> 02:09:49,040
but what could kill all these cattle,
you know,

2352
02:09:49,050 --> 02:09:52,390
at the time,
the reagan administration and all that,

2353
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:57,640
the tension was really high between the 
soviet union and United States.

2354
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:00,280
And they said,
and they were joking with me saying,

2355
02:10:00,281 --> 02:10:00,790
oh,
well,

2356
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:01,560
okay,
you know,

2357
02:10:01,810 --> 02:10:02,980
when it's gonna to happen,
I go,

2358
02:10:03,010 --> 02:10:08,010
I know I was in olympia and I needed to 
rush up to darrington to stay in my 

2359
02:10:08,010 --> 02:10:09,880
cabin because my books are up there.
My manuscript was up there.

2360
02:10:09,881 --> 02:10:11,560
I need to save,
save my research.

2361
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:14,260
So they laughed and they laughed.
They said,

2362
02:10:14,261 --> 02:10:15,640
well,
when's the world going to end?

2363
02:10:15,641 --> 02:10:16,420
Paul?
And I go,

2364
02:10:16,421 --> 02:10:18,130
well,
there's not this weekend.

2365
02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:20,860
That was like in two days,
it's next weekend.

2366
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:24,070
So they wrote on the calendar,
December 1st,

2367
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:26,860
I put it in my book,
I think it's 1975,

2368
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:30,430
the end of the world that wrote,
paul predicts the end of the world.

2369
02:10:31,540 --> 02:10:35,720
So we forgot about it.
Massive rains the next week,

2370
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:37,640
huge amounts of snowfall.

2371
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:40,180
And then on wednesday,
thursday,

2372
02:10:40,181 --> 02:10:44,020
temperature inversion,
and it flipped to 75 to 85 degrees.

2373
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:49,800
All the snow started to melt.
All the rivers were flooding and my 

2374
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:53,581
little cabin was right next to this 
river that would swell from date and 

2375
02:10:53,581 --> 02:10:58,290
have a morning tonight.
It go up six feet just from the snow 

2376
02:10:58,290 --> 02:11:02,401
melt.
And because we're very close to this 

2377
02:11:02,401 --> 02:11:02,401
volcano and the glaciers as,
oh my gosh,

2378
02:11:02,401 --> 02:11:03,460
I'm gonna lose my manuscript.
All my research.

2379
02:11:03,461 --> 02:11:04,870
I need to get up there,
I need to go up there.

2380
02:11:05,230 --> 02:11:07,660
And so I'm watching the news on news and
the roads are being closed.

2381
02:11:07,661 --> 02:11:09,220
So I had to go through rockport,
Washington,

2382
02:11:09,221 --> 02:11:10,810
the back way in order to get back to my 
cabin.

2383
02:11:10,811 --> 02:11:14,560
I get to my cabin and the bank had 
eroded about 10 feet.

2384
02:11:14,561 --> 02:11:16,210
I was only about 10,
12 feet away from the,

2385
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:16,810
from the river.

2386
02:11:16,810 --> 02:11:19,090
Now my cabin was on the verge of falling
into it,

2387
02:11:19,091 --> 02:11:22,360
but I thought my manuscript,
I got all my books and I rescued all the

2388
02:11:22,361 --> 02:11:25,540
material,
had medical and get out of there because

2389
02:11:25,541 --> 02:11:28,070
the roads that have been closed and so I
had to wait,

2390
02:11:28,090 --> 02:11:33,090
wait two days,
two days and the roads then opened up 

2391
02:11:33,090 --> 02:11:36,990
and I drove out out of the valley and to
snohomish valley and I went around the 

2392
02:11:37,481 --> 02:11:41,410
bend and there the son that was a 
brilliant sunny day,

2393
02:11:41,470 --> 02:11:46,470
a warm day and there floating in the 
fields were hundreds and hundreds of 

2394
02:11:46,470 --> 02:11:51,050
dead cattle.
How do you explain that?

2395
02:11:53,260 --> 02:11:55,090
I entered,
I think into the multiverse.

2396
02:11:55,820 --> 02:11:56,700
Oh,

2397
02:11:57,890 --> 02:12:02,890
now as a scientist,
you realize when you say something like 

2398
02:12:02,890 --> 02:12:02,890
that,
you open yourself up to ridicule.

2399
02:12:02,890 --> 02:12:04,820
Do you feel hesitant to communicate 
these ideas?

2400
02:12:05,350 --> 02:12:06,340
to a degree,
yes,

2401
02:12:06,341 --> 02:12:08,290
but you know,
I'm 62 years of age and you know,

2402
02:12:08,291 --> 02:12:11,050
at one point I just don't care.
I just don't care.

2403
02:12:11,110 --> 02:12:12,760
You know,
this is true.

2404
02:12:12,761 --> 02:12:17,761
This happened to me and I can push the 
envelope on these ideas because the 

2405
02:12:17,761 --> 02:12:19,090
credibility of My research as well 
established.

2406
02:12:19,180 --> 02:12:24,180
I can save the bees.
Do you care whether I have taken 

2407
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:25,660
silicide mushrooms?
If I can save your farm,

2408
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:27,790
your family,
your country or the world?

2409
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:29,950
Billions of dollars and protect 
biosecurity.

2410
02:12:30,130 --> 02:12:31,660
I care more.
I care more.

2411
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:33,940
That's right.
So I'm telling you things.

2412
02:12:33,941 --> 02:12:36,760
I'm not making these up.
I just.

2413
02:12:37,890 --> 02:12:42,890
But just because you can't explain it 
does not mean it's not true and I think 

2414
02:12:42,890 --> 02:12:47,251
that we need to accept the fact that the
reality is not limited to the perception

2415
02:12:47,590 --> 02:12:51,350
that we have traditionally used.
That's a beautiful way to describe it.

2416
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:54,560
Let's end with that.
That's perfect.

2417
02:12:54,620 --> 02:12:56,900
Thank you brother paul.
Thank you so much.

2418
02:12:56,901 --> 02:13:01,901
I'm so glad you came here and thank you 
to all the people that recommended you 

2419
02:13:01,901 --> 02:13:04,670
and turned me onto your work.
And can we do this again?

2420
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:06,470
I'd love to please.
All right.

2421
02:13:06,530 --> 02:13:09,530
And if people want to research more of 
your stuff,

2422
02:13:09,590 --> 02:13:14,590
fungi.com.
And what was the other website and host 

2423
02:13:14,590 --> 02:13:15,650
defense.com.
Host defense.com.

2424
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:18,530
And there's a ton of other information,
ted talk

2425
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:23,680
and I like youtube.com/paul
stamets site and louie schwartzberg a 

2426
02:13:24,170 --> 02:13:27,470
shout out.
We have a fantastic fungi.com.

2427
02:13:27,780 --> 02:13:28,640
Check it out.
Louis,

2428
02:13:28,660 --> 02:13:31,070
now are coming out with a movie that 
describes much of this stuff.

2429
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:32,070
Thank you so much.

2430
02:13:32,090 --> 02:13:33,130
All right.
Thank you brother.

2431
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:34,200
Woo.
That was awesome.
