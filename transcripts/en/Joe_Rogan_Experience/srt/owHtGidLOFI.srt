1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
Sweet jesus.
Fuck yeah.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,100
The Joe Rogan experience podcast.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,630
This is getting boring saying this way.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,660
Every time they listen to what I like
most about this podcast is it has no

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,010
professionalism to it whatsoever.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,440
So when I have to say the
same shit over and over again,

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,720
I feel like I'm being a
professional and I feel like, uh,

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,670
I'm not doing myself a service. It's
nonsense. You know what the fuck it is?

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,200
We're sponsored. How do we pay the
bills? Okay, how do I employ Brian?

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,260
We have to get money. This is where
we get it. We get it from brain pills,

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,350
Alpha brain. What does Alpha
brain, what does Alpha brain,

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,580
it's cognitive enhancing
supplement. It is a, uh,

13
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:46,581
a supplement that has a bunch of
the very best nutrients to support

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,430
neurochemistry. And the
idea is that, you know,

15
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:52,680
your body essentially runs on nutrients.

16
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:56,550
It's what you need to have
everything functioning optimally,

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,810
but you can adjust those levels and add
things and you can get benefits from it.

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,980
And Alpha brain to me
is, uh, I, I am fucking,

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,410
I'm lost without it. If
I don't have it, I've,

20
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:10,650
I really do kind of freak out and people
think that I've had people say that

21
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:13,800
it's a placebo effect and
I say you're fucking crazy.

22
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:17,370
Cause it gives me these most incredibly
vivid dreams that I never used to have

23
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:20,970
before. And you know, I think
everybody's different. I don't know.

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,360
I don't know how sensitive you are
to your body, but I'm very sensitive.

25
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,870
I'm very sensitive to what's working,
what's not working,

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,830
how I feel when I take fish oil,
how I feel when I don't take fish oil,

27
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,060
my body to Joe. I am sensitive. I'm
trying to be sensitive to your soul.

28
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:41,061
Brian tried to be sensitive to as an
essence realize that were sponsored by a

29
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:43,260
pharmaceutical company.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,850
Well it's not a pharmaceutical comp
kind of their vitamins for your mind.

31
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,860
Vitamins for your dumb.

32
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,980
Well it is kind of crazy because we also
sell kettle bells and battle ropes and

33
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,790
uh, you're blending it sounds
like that, right? Yeah.

34
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,420
You're building on fucking army for
some reasons and I'm just trying to

35
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:04,890
strengthen up men. All right. Strengthen
your mind and your fucking body.

36
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:09,090
And that's what on it's all about what is,
I take Alpha brain every fucking day.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,460
I definitely take it before every podcast.
In fact,

38
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:15,270
they usually do it in the middle of the
podcast, which is why I'm at my best.

39
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:19,050
About an hour or so. Anne, what do you
got over there? I got only new mood.

40
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,420
I don't want to take new meter.
And now you've got any of that Alpha brain

41
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,173
retarded.

42
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,160
I was like the worst commercial
for Alpha brain over.

43
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,030
I've been hanging out in Ohio. That's why,
oh, the drain due again. Those vampires,

44
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:36,930
they got ahold of the courts. We
have um, this new shit that's in,

45
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:38,730
it's called hemp force and uh,

46
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,000
all the information on any of these things
that I don't want to go too in depth

47
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,030
because people can play in it. These,
these commercials take too long.

48
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,410
What we're trying to do it on it is
sell you the very best shit possible.

49
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:53,190
As cheap as we can,
and to make it as easy as possible.

50
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:57,960
So we have a 100% money back guarantee
on your first order of 30 vitamins,

51
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,190
30 pills.
It's Alpha brain or new

52
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,581
mood,

53
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:05,581
which is a five HTP and l tryptofan
supplement that actually boosts your mood.

54
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:09,100
It actually boosts your serotonin levels.
And these are all this is,

55
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,980
there's a lot of science behind this
stuff, but it's very controversial.

56
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,260
So if you're interested
at all in nootropics,

57
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:18,730
I suggest that you Google the word new
tropics and just read on the pros and

58
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,990
cons. But to me vitamins are a
very important part of my life.

59
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:27,370
I think supplementing has
made me a healthier person
with a body that functions

60
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:29,200
better period.
Um,

61
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,130
we also have these kettle bells and
battle ropes that are in and I've talked

62
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,300
about them Ad Nauseum,

63
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,480
but the new news is I will definitely be
doing a kettle bell DVD with the Great

64
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,450
Steve Maxwell's mate.
Yeah, we uh, we went,

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,730
we did some emails back and forth and uh,
Steve is totally down.

66
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:47,620
So we're going to, we're
going to do, he's going to,

67
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,640
what are we going to do is I'm going to
have Steve put me through like one of

68
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:55,900
his brutal workouts and people at home
will be able to do it along with them and

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,170
I, I'm, I'm trying to, I'm trying to do
it for too because people, first of all,

70
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:01,270
people keep asking me to do
one of these and second of all,

71
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:05,530
because I think people could
really benefit from kettle bells.

72
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,090
I think it's a more interesting way to
work out. It feels more satisfying to me.

73
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,200
It's fucking harder.

74
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,200
Like when I see someone like just
doing bicep curls now I'm like,

75
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:17,680
you silly bitch. Like
that's nonsense. Like it's,

76
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,790
it's too easy to,
to really get like real benefits that you,

77
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,890
you see when you roll,
when you do Jujitsu,

78
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,620
I feel like you have to do
something really difficult.

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,340
You have to do either power lifting,
you have to do cleans and presses,

80
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:33,010
you have to do squats,
you have to do dead lifts.

81
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,950
If you want to like really get a benefit,
you have to do that.

82
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,080
Or you got to do something
like kettle bells.

83
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,890
And what I like about kettle bells is you,
you got it.

84
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,950
You develop amazing core strength
because you're essentially balancing this

85
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,360
fucking cannon ball and moving it
around and it makes your body work

86
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:51,580
intelligently as one unit.

87
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,080
And I think you using your body to lift
weights as one unit instead of isolating

88
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:59,290
areas to me,
shows the best benefits athletically.

89
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,050
So all that shit we sell and on at.com,

90
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,330
um, the vitamins, what
video you're making,

91
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:06,750
Jim kills me and wants to
know if you be aware, GSP,

92
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,370
I shorts and shorts at GSB.

93
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:11,110
Where's doesn't really tight
ones that he wants to know.

94
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,980
If you would go do it for
him. Okay, I will do that for
him. I still love him. Um,

95
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,890
anyway, uh, go to [inaudible]
dot com use the code. Any Rogan,

96
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,250
save 10% off any of the supplements. Um,
and, uh, that's including the hemp force.

97
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,940
So you go check it out on a.com o.
N n I t.

98
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,090
And we also want to thank Alienware
for providing us with these super dope

99
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,920
computers.
And I'm now using alien,

100
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:34,190
whereas the computer that I used
to watch youtube videos and stuff,

101
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:37,100
so there it's going to be a lot of
new shenanigans flow. Excellent.

102
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,790
We'll get to see pop up screens.
The computers are awesome,

103
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,760
but windows can suck it. How
about that? How about that?

104
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,140
We need to figure out a way to port these
bitches over to Mac. Ooh, wait a minute.

105
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:51,370
Fanboys all across the world just went,
what the fuck man. I've been playing,

106
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,420
I've been playing a future sponsor,
uh, on the, uh, like, yeah.

107
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,160
I don't know if I can talk about it,
but it's

108
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,790
pretty cool. You don't know if you can
talk about it. I remember the, the gay,

109
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,930
the IPAD a game. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. We'll, we'll, we'll soon. Yeah,

110
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,100
you've been previewing it and we are,

111
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:11,680
we will soon be sponsored by
a new game company. Um, uh,

112
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,690
that's making a really bad ass iPad games.
Yeah.

113
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:17,360
And I've been using my iPad a lot
because of this game, which is,

114
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:20,570
it's kind of weird. It's turned into a
game boy almost. Yeah. Almost Twitter.

115
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,090
Well this, that should be
finalized real shown. All right.

116
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,680
So let's roll the podcast Rep.
We got a lot of shit to talk about.

117
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,783
A lot of shit.

118
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,723
Oh,

119
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,160
pitch out Rogan experience
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

120
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,320
Ladies and gentlemen, we are joined by
congressional candidate David Seaman.

121
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,450
That sounds so, that sounds so official,
dude. I know. It feels kind of ridiculous.

122
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,300
I was at lunch that day with a friend
of mine if we check this and uh,

123
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,180
we were talking about it,

124
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,250
it just sounds so ridiculous to talk
about like your supporters and campaigning

125
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:06,800
and all this. But uh, it's cool in a way,

126
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,570
cause I used to be the guy who had just
watched TV and be so angry that all of

127
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,060
these dumb asses had been in for 20
years and her legislative terrible stuff.

128
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,120
So I've just read articles about
it and do youtube videos about it.

129
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,960
And then a number of things happened and
I actually had an opportunity to run.

130
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,560
So why not? Why not jump in instead of
just being on the sidelines? Yep. Wow.

131
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:30,240
That's, did you feel compelled?
Do you feel like a calling
me? How old are you? I,

132
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,870
I'm a, I'm in my mid twenties.
You, you don't want to say I'm 26.

133
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,810
Why didn't you want to say uh,

134
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,790
cause mid twenties more people
can connect with that than 26

135
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,330
we just ruined your entire campaign
over buddy. I'm just kidding.

136
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,180
I don't know. There's normally,
here's why I answered that way.

137
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:49,890
Normally it's a girl who
asked me how old I am.

138
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,200
And so you can go for like 10
minutes on the guessing game.

139
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,260
Oh and you liked that? I liked
that. So you treat me like a chick.

140
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,730
Well I dare you sir.
How dare you run your shenanigans my way

141
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,990
dude,
I respect you.

142
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:07,680
If you're still running around with a
last name like semen and being a young man

143
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,430
that had to be brutal. What the fuck was
high school? Like? High school was cool.

144
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,560
It was middle school is bad.
Cause in high school people were like,

145
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:16,240
okay there were over it. Yeah.
Like in middle school though,

146
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,120
you take the science class where you
first learned about like that that happens

147
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,820
and people just go wild.
They love it. That's it.

148
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,770
It was kind of tempered by there's this
guy in my same class with the last name

149
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:33,771
either Butkus or but Lik I think it
was but lik so like semen was almost a

150
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:37,890
little too. It was a little too
obscure for people to grasp but like,

151
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:39,750
but like you could just
jump on that and you could,

152
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,820
you could really believe that kid.

153
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,630
It's funny how weird noises with your
mouth like have a different effect on

154
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:49,740
people. Totally. You know, or curse curse
words. Like why is something a curse word?

155
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:52,500
It's just something coming out
of your mouth. It's, it's almost,

156
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:54,930
to me it's like that's
the beginnings of all

157
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,970
the beginning of the vault ignorance
is this idea that we have bad words.

158
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,120
It's like, it's almost like
if you can convince people,

159
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:05,760
like if everybody agrees
that there's bad words,

160
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:08,340
we all agree there's words you
should never say in certain company.

161
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,810
If you do that, that's a step step
one on the way to be full of shit.

162
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,420
And that, you know, it's weird that
we still accept that. It's so silly.

163
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,720
It's the, those words are
important. If people don't use them,

164
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:24,930
they're not as fun to talk
to. You know? I don't know.

165
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,010
A single person that never swears that's
as legitimately fun to talk to is my

166
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:30,240
friends who swear all the time.

167
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,930
If you don't swear it all,
there's something a little
bit wrong with you. Yeah. Uh,

168
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,340
cause it's just,
it's not the way people speak.

169
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,090
It's stupid. It's, it's,
it's you by not using it.

170
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:44,140
It's stupid because sometimes it's the
fucking word to use. Stop right there.

171
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:47,770
It was extra fucking, you know, you're
my mom. There's something wrong with her.

172
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:50,710
Cause she, I, I'll say shit. And
she was like, Bryan was like,

173
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,290
what sucks by your mom's religious though,
Dude.

174
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,600
That's where things could get odd.
Right. Um, in running for Congress,

175
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:01,380
is that important? Do you have to bring
up religion? Is it, do you feel like, uh,

176
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,980
you need people on your team?

177
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,091
Uh, well, I mean,

178
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:07,450
I have a lot of republican and a lot of
democratic supporters and obviously a

179
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:09,340
lot of independence
and libertarian minded,

180
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,600
but they're not supporting me because
of what I believe metaphysically,

181
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,560
whatever that may be.

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,220
There were supporting me just because
I want to protect the constitution and

183
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:20,860
defend the bill of rights. And for
most people, that's enough right there.

184
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,750
And if you believe in those things,

185
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:26,500
you know that my personal beliefs are
kind of irrelevant as long as I'm not a

186
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,330
member of the League of shadows or
something, you know, and like, yeah,

187
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,240
as long as your religion
isn't harmful to anybody,

188
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:36,241
it doesn't matter if you're an atheist
or if you're a skeptic or secular or,

189
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,140
you know, extremely. Uh, what's
the word? Extremely devout.

190
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,500
That shouldn't really matter when you're
representing your, your, uh, district.

191
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,900
Yeah, I couldn't agree more
and I, you know, I really,

192
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,880
I've been callous about people's ideas
in the past and made fun of silly

193
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:54,361
religions.

194
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:59,280
But the reality is some of the nicest
people I know are religious people. I,

195
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,390
I have a friend who's a Mormon, is like
one of the nicest guys on earth. This,

196
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,230
I now have a frozen
Scientologists. Oh, I've never seen

197
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,750
met Amine Mormon.

198
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,030
They're like nice to the point
where you're like a little bit upset

199
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,460
and they're really charitable. They're
like, it's a beautiful religion. If you,

200
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:17,880
if you know people that are Mormons and
you see like how much they help each

201
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:21,870
other when there's like a, if there's
any sort of a crisis or one family has,

202
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,150
how much they chip in, it's a beautiful
community. Even if it's based on nonsense.

203
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,770
It's a,
it's a beautiful community,

204
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,820
but you should be able to do whatever
the fuck you want as long as you're nice.

205
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,860
You know, if that, I like
that guy's my friend.

206
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,690
I mean he believes all
kinds of wacky shit.

207
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:39,630
They wa they used to wear a special
underwear, the whole fucking deal.

208
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,650
But he's my friend. He's a nice guy. I
don't need him to believe everything.

209
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:44,460
I believe.

210
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,630
I just need to be able to interact with
him and know that he's got my interest

211
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:50,460
and his interests and
everybody's interests at heart.

212
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,830
He's not just trying to fuck
the whole thing up for himself.

213
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,040
Yeah, well I mean personal beliefs. Uh,

214
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,810
once you start telling somebody that they
can believe in what they can't believe

215
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,950
in terms of religion, you're
jumping a huge jumping. It's, yeah,

216
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,020
it's a very slippery slope.

217
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,100
It's so when we,
you know,

218
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:12,101
I think the idea is we should be as
honest as possible about everything about

219
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:15,110
it. You know, all your own
personal beliefs and religion.

220
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:17,030
We should all be as honest as possible.

221
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,820
And I think we would come
to like a remarkable middle
ground if we took away all

222
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,580
the ideology. I think we
would come to, if we all,

223
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,350
if we all got together
for the whole world,

224
00:12:27,351 --> 00:12:29,900
could speak one language and we
sat down and talked about religion,

225
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,033
I think we could,

226
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,190
we would form a remarkably similar
opinions if we're really honest about what

227
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:40,010
the fuck happens when you die and
about who has created this earth.

228
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,810
It's a massive mystery.

229
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,960
Well that, that's the, uh, I'm definitely
not religious, but people have asked me,

230
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:50,640
uh, somebody's online on Google
plus actually asked me, he was like,

231
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:54,510
do you believe in God this the deal
breaker for me it was this atheist. So,

232
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:55,730
and first of all he was,
he was,

233
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,320
he was posting a comment on a thread
that had nothing to do with that.

234
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,650
I was writing something about
censorship or like Internet censorship.

235
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:04,500
And this is question totally like
hijacking what we're talking about,

236
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,000
but I wanted to answer him and I said,
you know,

237
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,970
I believe in a higher power because I
really don't want to believe that we're

238
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:13,410
the most advanced thing in the universe.
Like this iPhone over there is the,

239
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,830
the most high tech incredible thing
invented in the whole universe.

240
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:17,790
I just don't believe that.

241
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,260
And I don't believe that we're necessarily
the highest level of intelligence out

242
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:24,930
there. I don't, you know, and
if you look at where we are now,

243
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,790
a atheist want you to believe that we
came from kind of like toxic sludge

244
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,050
billions of years ago,

245
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:36,051
washing up on the shore and it kind of
pre oxygenated earth or whatever the

246
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:40,230
details are. And I'd like to think
that there's more to life than that.

247
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,123
I really would.

248
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:46,500
Well, uh, I would like to
too. I don't want to, you
don't want, you don't want to,

249
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,800
you want to think this is it.

250
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,800
This is the fucking floor it and
see where it crashes. Absolutely.

251
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,741
You know,

252
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:56,860
I think a lot of us would like to think
there's something out there that's a,

253
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,000
that's smarter than us.

254
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,600
I think the real issue is ego is that
the human ego is aware of itself.

255
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,350
And I think when a person
is aware of themselves,

256
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,800
when you start thinking of yourself
and you want to keep yourself alive,

257
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,730
you start looking at yourself like
very selfishly and an objectively.

258
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,030
You start looking at yourself like
you're super, super fucking important.

259
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,220
You know?
I think if we,

260
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,560
if we could get past that and you looked
at life and intelligence, you would say,

261
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:31,000
well, why does it have to be coming out
of the mouth of some thing that can move

262
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:34,270
around? Why am I assuming that
that's the only intelligence?

263
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,660
How do I not know that there's
not intelligence and stars?

264
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:39,010
How do I not know that
there's intent there?

265
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:43,330
There could be hyper intelligence
all around us. We're just,

266
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:46,030
we're not capable of
hearing it's frequency.

267
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,130
We're not capable of
communicating with it.

268
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,370
Why does this bag of blood and cells and
nerve endings and electrical impulses,

269
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,580
why does this make noise with its mouth
and change the world? Why does it,

270
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:02,270
why the fuck does that happen? Well,
who knows? It doesn't make any sense.

271
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,350
How do you,

272
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,950
how do you not know that there is not
an intelligence to everything around us

273
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:07,521
all the time.

274
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:11,270
It's just imperceptible to us and
they're starting to figure this out with

275
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,050
plants.

276
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,870
They're starting to figure out that
plants have some sort of rudimentary or a

277
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,950
unknown rather,
I'm going shouldn't say rudimentary.

278
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,750
You might be like really complicated
method of communicating with each other.

279
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,820
It's fucking, I'm actually,
I've actually ready

280
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,040
when one of the, one of the
trees gets cut down. Hey, send a,

281
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,260
like a chemical signal through
the roots. The other trees. Yeah.

282
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:32,050
And like warn them or something.

283
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,330
Nothing really matters cause you're
a tree and you can't go anywhere.

284
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,380
But they still, they send out the warning
signal, you know? And uh, there's,

285
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,240
I don't know if this has
been debunked or not,

286
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:44,740
but somebody put out a book a while ago
that my aunt was really into and it was

287
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:48,130
like if you're in a room with the plant
and you have positive emotions of like,

288
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,400
I love this plant, it fares better
than a plant where you're like,

289
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,780
I need it for this damn thing out.

290
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,120
Yeah. They, yeah, I think that's real.

291
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,260
I don't even think we might
have to Snopes that one. Nope.

292
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:01,600
It cause Snopes tends to be
pretty honest about that shit.

293
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,970
Although there do seem
a little pessimistic.

294
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,310
You're saying Snopes once in a while. I
was on the rag. I Dunno. Do you think so?

295
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,173
Yeah.

296
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,160
Question Snoop Bees,
butthole.

297
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,540
Do Plants do plants? Do you
plants care? Do you plan

298
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,440
a positive emotion plant?

299
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,570
Yeah. Positive. Yeah.
Positive singing to plants,

300
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,460
benefits of Po Positive Planet sex people.

301
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,540
I wonder if he had sex with lance if
they would grow bigger maybe if you just

302
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,160
came on your plant.
Oh yeah.

303
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,970
Sprinkled a little every day on one

304
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,000
communication. I put so many, some
Gatorade once and it looked like a grease,

305
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,400
like twice its size overnight.
What?

306
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,110
I put some come in and I wipe my come off
in with Gatorade and it seemed like it

307
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,350
just expanded really big in the Gatorade.

308
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,070
So I don't know if there's a chemical
reaction between the two, but yeah,

309
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,470
this is a,
I think I was too vague in my search.

310
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,380
People talk to plants. What, what would
you say? It's not people talk positive,

311
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:10,610
positive energy or energy around plants.
Helping

312
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:12,923
butthole.

313
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,190
Is that hurricane hitting
Florida right now?

314
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,770
Got It. I got out of there. Uh, they
offered to change my flight for no fee.

315
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,310
Oh, relied. Flew out a day early. Just
because you want to be stuck in that.

316
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:27,130
Even if there is nothing big
airlines will cancel your flights.

317
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,240
Just out of caution.

318
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,131
You know,
I,

319
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:33,700
I flew on southwest the other day and I
just wanted to sleep and the whole time

320
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,780
they played games on the intercom and
like, like Trivia Games with everyone,

321
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:40,480
they're like, now press your
button, that Ding button, you know,

322
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:43,270
like the help me button.
It seemed totally illegal because like,

323
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,380
what if somebody really needed help,

324
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:47,260
like a heart attack and there's all these
people dinging and they're like, no,

325
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,100
I'm having a heart attack. You
know, a southwest. I don't,

326
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,320
I don't like those games.
Like, uh, I remember one time,

327
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,450
I don't want to like single out and
say it was definitely southwest cause I

328
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:58,620
don't, I don't wanna be sued. Right. But
I'm like 99% sure it was southwest. Yeah,

329
00:17:58,621 --> 00:17:58,921
me too.

330
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:02,880
I'm 99.9 the flight attendant was making
some kind of lame joke about like I

331
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:06,120
hope like hopefully we'll land. Right.
And I was like, that's like for me,

332
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:07,740
it doesn't matter cause
you fly enough times,

333
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:09,400
you know that the odds are in your favor.
Right.

334
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,420
But every once in a while to get that
person who's flying for the first time.

335
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,060
Right. And that probably freaks
the hell out of that person.

336
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,820
Yeah. You almost swore and, and you
know, backed off it perfectly though.

337
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,770
This is what one of the stewardess said,

338
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,290
I'm trying to sleep and they're
screaming on Entercom the whole flight.

339
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,560
I want to kill people. Like,
like, like she says, all right,

340
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:31,060
now take your seatbelt and
cross your lips. Oh, I'm in
hips and I'm thinking like,

341
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:35,050
did she just meet Pussy lips cause she
made like the motion like cross your belt

342
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:37,150
over your,
she probably used to be a stripper name.

343
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,070
She was a flood trying to sleep

344
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,930
America. I was pretty impressed with, uh,

345
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,900
I don't know how they're
able to do this legally,

346
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:46,930
but everybody was young and
had a good attitude. Yeah.

347
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,190
And that's like my
euphemism for hot women. Uh,

348
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:55,150
and there are other airlines like because
of unions and stuff, they're just,

349
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:58,510
they have serious attitude.
They hate their job and they're old.

350
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,370
They've been there for like 30 years.
Yeah.

351
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,580
And or theirs, their standup comics
that never made it. And the other,

352
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,280
they're trying to material out
because they have a captive audience.

353
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:08,280
Who are you gonna do?
Like jump out?

354
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,350
Joey and I had a guy recently in flying
into Denver that has like a whole

355
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,920
routine. They're like, how to let go.
He was doing stand up. I was like,

356
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,550
as a standup, I know when someone's doing
standup, like he was doing stand up,

357
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,240
he had like a whole routine that it would
do like a bunch of one liners about,

358
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:25,190
uh, about travel. It was so silly.

359
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,760
There's this one pilot that sings
every time he takes off and lands.

360
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,470
It's a song that should definitely be
legal cause you use using the like using

361
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:36,320
up the airwaves. I know what
I'm saying. It's ridiculous.

362
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,370
Do you have it? It's just so gross.
Like who are you? This is my plane.

363
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:43,650
I'm not a pilot.
Slaps the waitress on it.

364
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:47,040
Her ass was it flight attendant on
her ass as he moves into the cockpit,

365
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,190
gives his buddy knuckles.
I'm going sing to these people.

366
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:53,980
They need to hear my voice and loop brain.

367
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,690
It was also so cold and I was like can I
please have a blanket? And they're like,

368
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:59,760
we don't have blankets.
And I'm like all right.

369
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:02,640
So I had to make one of those like things
where you take your arms and put it

370
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:06,900
inside your shirt and then just like
make a cocoon and like bundle up in a

371
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:09,780
corner because it was so freezing on
the plane. Why they're doing this.

372
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,980
How healthy could it be being a pilot
you just flying up and lasted by

373
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,320
radiation. Plastic by radiation
in front of like a window.

374
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,170
Yeah. It makes me want to play
trivia games or the inner comments.

375
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:26,880
He knows how much radiation is involved
in, in plane flight. Do you know? Uh,

376
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:29,970
I heard something like a cross country
is like the equivalent of a chest x ray

377
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:32,580
or something. It's not,
it's not, it's nothing.

378
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:35,970
It's just the fact if you're flying
every single day as they do it,

379
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:38,120
my dad up and uh,

380
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,970
radiation is not as bad for you as people
make it out to be like the Fukushima

381
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:45,420
style stuff is definitely really
bad for you. But in terms of like,

382
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:48,070
just low ambient doses,
you're getting radiation

383
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,120
just walking outside.

384
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,410
I make sure everything I read somewhere
like in a kitchen with a marble top

385
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,500
that's giving off radiation. Yeah.
Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Yeah.

386
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:59,800
I was watching some documentary on TV
where they were talking about dinosaur

387
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,650
bones.
Some of them being radioactive.

388
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:07,960
They need a coat them with lead paint to
try to reduce the amount of radioactive

389
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,840
energy that came off. I don't know.
Right. It's horse shit or not. It sounds,

390
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,130
it sounds silly, but it actually makes
sense if the dinosaurs died, you know,

391
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:18,640
from some sort of a, um, uh, a
meteor impact or something like that,

392
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,660
that there was some mean 6,000
and 6,000 years ago, right? Yeah.

393
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,740
How long has a half life for
that stuff? They said, no,

394
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm saying the dinosaurs 6,000 years ago,

395
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,140
it was at least 6,060 6,000 or more.
How do you deal with that question?

396
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,770
Is Anybody ever, for folks who don't
know what the fuck we're talking about,

397
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,130
serious fundamentalists believed
that the earth is 6,000 years old?

398
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,870
I think the way I'd answer is I'd be like,

399
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:43,030
I definitely believe there were dinosaurs
on the planet 6,000 or more years ago.

400
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,670
I don't believe they're
tricked by the devil.

401
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,420
I don't believe like dinosaur fossils
are there to confuse us and like question

402
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:51,910
our faith. I think they're there
because their dinosaur fossils,

403
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,300
Bill Hicks had a great joke about that.
It doesn't make you,

404
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:57,730
it doesn't it bother you.
The God might be fucking with you.

405
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,580
God might be fucking with your head.

406
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,830
That's such a great bit about God burying
dinosaur bones and Giggling, like,

407
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:08,110
figure this out.
Now he's questioning your faith.

408
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:09,550
That's what's all that's hilarious.

409
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,660
That is one of the most beautiful
ways to shut down new ideas.

410
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,710
It's Satan questioning
your faith. Yeah. Yeah.

411
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:22,060
You can't let that 6,000 year thank
go. Okay. We know more now period.

412
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,770
You can't trust what was in a book that
was written by people who, you know,

413
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:30,550
we're deciphering it from several other
different languages. Also, by the way,

414
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,530
it didn't immediately go to English.

415
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:37,000
It had to be translated from Hebrew to
Latin to grid and a lot of shit missing

416
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:41,470
from that man. Maybe that's 6,000 years
is a figure of speech, you know? Yeah.

417
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,720
I wondered about that. Like you look
at a Wikipedia entry and here we have,

418
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,940
we have digital content where you
transfer something and it's 100%, uh,

419
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,440
intact back then.

420
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:53,030
You're just doing it by hand and
like you have other issues going on.

421
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:56,470
Maybe you get hit with plague and shit.
Fuck the editors get wiped out.

422
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:59,350
But like whenever you copy
something from book to book,

423
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,090
they're going to be big changes. Just
that of like it's what happens, accidents,

424
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,370
you know? Yeah, yeah. So true.

425
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,730
There's no way you can spread information
on the back of animal hides for a

426
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,900
thousand years and have
that shit come out perfect.

427
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,730
It's kind of let that 6,000
year thing go. Well, it's wild.

428
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:21,910
It just like for 400 years ago,
people really thought that a or the,

429
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:22,691
I don't know if they've thought this,

430
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:26,770
they were told that the
earth was the center of the
universe. Yeah. And you know,

431
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:28,840
these people were not any
dumber than we are today.

432
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:33,520
Like biologically the same brain and
people were doing smart stuff back then,

433
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,470
but they had to like buy in
at this collective bullshit.
Like, Oh yeah. Uh, it is,

434
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,660
we're definitely the center of the
university even though we know that that's

435
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:43,870
not the case.
And back then if you said something,

436
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,550
if you came out with new information

437
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,610
that showed that the current
model was completely false,

438
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,630
they will put you in jail or kill.
You just accept it.

439
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,660
You weren't allowed to just
come out and say, hey man,

440
00:23:56,661 --> 00:24:01,430
I think that we're spinning around
it and it's one of a bunch of them.

441
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,150
Yeah. We weren't allowed to say
that. They were like when gout,

442
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,210
there wasn't Galileo was
put under house arrest and

443
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,640
yeah, he was under house arrest. I
mean it was considered heresy, right?

444
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,130
Yeah. You new information. Is
he considered like say tannic?

445
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:17,730
They wanted to, what's really
exciting if you, I mean ridiculous.

446
00:24:17,731 --> 00:24:19,140
Rather if you stop and think about that,

447
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:23,310
like they just won the block
down information so bad
that if you had some new

448
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:26,790
stuff they wouldn't even consider it.
It was the work of the devil.

449
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:29,670
They had it locked down.
They know exactly what was up.

450
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,100
That kind of confidence is so ridiculous.

451
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,280
Well, it might've been lack
of confidence actually,

452
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:36,830
because if you acknowledge
that, okay, you guys are right,

453
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,580
the earth is just this insignificant
thing in a much bigger picture,

454
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,440
then maybe people go, what about the pope?
Do we still have to pay homage to them?

455
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:48,750
Or could that be a typo? Also,
you know, uh, that's awesome.

456
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,670
One of the most ridiculous things
ever that like foreign dignitaries and

457
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,950
presidents and prime ministers,

458
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,860
they have to sit down and
meet with the fucking pope.

459
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,140
They have to sit down and meet with this
cult leader who's dressed like a wizard

460
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:05,630
in a star wars episode.
I mean,

461
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,580
it's the most ridiculous idea ever that
this guy should still be dressing like

462
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:14,480
this and 2012 and we should
still pretend that he's holy.

463
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,590
We should still pretend that he's got
the Willy Wonka golden ticket to Jesus's

464
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:22,550
fucking factory fuck house.
It's unbelievable, man.

465
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,990
It's unbelievable that that still works.
That kind of stuff is preposterous.

466
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:29,720
That kind of stuff is,
that's mind boggling.

467
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,990
It's not whether or not there's a god,
it's not whether or not, you know,

468
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,690
the idea of higher power exists.
Of course it does.

469
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:40,691
He would be crazy to think that some
higher intelligent might be at the end of

470
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:44,600
all this, why not? Who we are.

471
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,770
Look how much change we enact on our
environment and we do it thoughtfully.

472
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,320
We do it whether it's reasonable or not,

473
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,260
we're thinking about it while
we're doing it. And when,

474
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,250
when even when you throw
garbage in the ocean,

475
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:56,720
you're thinking about when you do that,

476
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,640
why wouldn't we assume that there's some
sort of an intelligence to galaxies?

477
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,690
Why wouldn't we assume that? You know,
just cause it can't talk English.

478
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,220
That's so arrogant to me.
I,

479
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:11,720
it's crazy to think that we're the only
intelligence just because we can clearly

480
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:14,360
communicate with each other but
can't communicate with other things.

481
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:18,640
Yeah. That's like, uh, how they test for
intelligence in schools at the sat test.

482
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:23,440
So you get somebody who's
good at memorizing facts
and filling out bubbles and

483
00:26:23,441 --> 00:26:27,510
it doesn't count it off of that person
who's like truly a genius at painting or

484
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,420
designing websites or doing things that
are ultimately like much more lucrative

485
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,000
than filling out a bubble test me.

486
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,890
Well Rosie. Yeah. Brian is
a good example. I mean you,

487
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:39,530
you did say that as a Chug,
but you are a good example.

488
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,530
Like you're great at what you do.
I fucking hate math.

489
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,590
Imagine if you had to do something else.
What if you had to be a lawnmower guy?

490
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,430
And what if you got to be a guy who mows
lawns? How good would you be at that?

491
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:54,620
He would fucking suck at that.
What does some people, you know,

492
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,270
certain things have no appeal to them.

493
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,440
They have no desire to do it for other
people. Other people love mowing lawns.

494
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,820
Okay? Some, I know dudes who are landscape
artists, they're fucking artists, man.

495
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,810
They put together like the put the plants
in the right place and they range the

496
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:14,370
flowers perfectly, cut everything. And
it creates this really nice aesthetic.

497
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:17,070
Like when a guy does it, your,
your front lawn and you know,

498
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:20,370
if there's a guy across the street from
my house who has like little gnomes and

499
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:22,710
shit, puts all these little
things in front of me,

500
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:26,810
he's creating light little work of art
out there that guys compelled to do that.

501
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,800
And Man, everybody's compelled
to do different shit.

502
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,530
The real problem is that
we don't recognize that.

503
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:34,710
We're always trying to push people
into areas where they're not compelled.

504
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,040
You know, we're trying to tell people,
you can't be a professional skateboarder.

505
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:41,640
There's no money in that.
Then you go, what the fuck
is Tony Hawk? Who's that guy?

506
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:44,880
Why is that guy's, that
guy's fucking huge. Okay,

507
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,240
how come he don't tell me there's
no money in it? There's money in it.

508
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,880
Just stop telling me what to do.
I'm going to do this.

509
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,743
I'm going to try to do that.

510
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,110
Well, people have such a
weird attitude. Like, uh,

511
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,220
I told people I was coming out here, do
your show and to do a couple of meetings.

512
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,360
And uh, they're like, so if somebody's
paying you to go out there and I'm like,

513
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:04,700
are you serious? Like I'm going to
be in front of millions of people.

514
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,150
And I'm like, that's the first
question in your mind is going to be,

515
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,340
am I being paid to come out? You know?
And people really think like that.

516
00:28:10,341 --> 00:28:12,800
Like you asked them to do something
and it's like, well, is this on the,

517
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,420
is this on the payroll? You know, and
you're like, just fucking do it. You know,

518
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,500
like if it's something important,
you should do it.

519
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:22,520
Like there are a lot of people who they
want to be in a cubicle and get paid on

520
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,980
a time schedule.
That's all they want.

521
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,750
And if they encounter somebody who's
not on that same, that same, uh,

522
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,290
thought process of, I wonder what my
annual salary this year is going to be,

523
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,170
then they're confused.
Like, wait a second,

524
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:39,790
why aren't you maximizing year
available work hours? You know?

525
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,030
Yeah. That's, we want to know that
we have a certain amount of money

526
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,350
coming in every month. Yeah.
I mean that, that's normal.

527
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:51,790
That's just like not wanting to starve.
Yeah. But then there are people who, uh,

528
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,270
took anything that's coming out of a
place of passion or a place of civic duty.

529
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,740
It's like, what does that all about?
You know, like, uh, the TSA for example,

530
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,750
whenever I rant about them on Twitter
or on one of my articles on business

531
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:08,500
insider, I get a couple of people who
always say they're just doing their jobs,

532
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:10,600
leave them alone. I'm like, that's,

533
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,750
that's the justification given for some
of the most evil stuff that's been done

534
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:15,610
on this planet.
We're just doing our jobs.

535
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,150
Find a job that doesn't violate people's
constitutional rights. You know,

536
00:29:19,151 --> 00:29:22,750
find a job where you can go home at
night and not be like embarrassed about

537
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:25,900
you're doing all day and for the money
they're making, whatever they're making,

538
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:30,250
it's not enough to just totally
infringe on other people's basic rights.

539
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,840
And I feel that way.
Like it's not all about the money.

540
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:36,040
It has to be the money and doing
something that you're okay with.

541
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,950
I don't think, I don't, first of all, um,

542
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,880
I don't think it's the fault of the Tsa.
I think first of all,

543
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:47,410
that's an incredibly difficult
job. Whenever you're trying
to search people shit,

544
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,910
when they're on their way somewhere,

545
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,450
that's a difficult job because what if
someone does get through with a bomb when,

546
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:57,160
if someone does get through some shit
that can it like the inside of the plane

547
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:58,420
on fire we got,

548
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:02,440
he gets a real problem and
we live in a fucked up time.

549
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,050
We really do.
We do live in a fucked up time,

550
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,530
but these people that are working there,
man, they're just people with jobs.

551
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:13,360
The people that are running the whole
thing must be responsible. Yeah. Yeah.

552
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,680
Whenever, whenever you have a problem
with somebody, it's the people at the top.

553
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,570
You, you give people a job like that. Like
you gotta make sure nobody has a bomb.

554
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,210
Like all right, you know,
like sir, listen to me sir.

555
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,890
Like people don't want to listen to you.
It's a,

556
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,080
people naturally get a little bit douchey.

557
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,950
Everybody you meet is NOI
to meet you all day long.

558
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,310
There are no aid to be in front of
you that annoyed you just getting this

559
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,580
fucking cancer ray from them all day long.

560
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,760
So I think we need to figure out a way,
first of all,

561
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:42,970
to make it like way less
intrusive on people. Definitely.

562
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,900
Well it's more realistic to like old
people and babies and shit really.

563
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:50,380
Is this baby a terrorist? Yeah.
Quiet. You know, it's one of the only,

564
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,700
for a lot of people it's one of the
only times where you meet the federal

565
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:55,670
government face to face, you know,
representative of the federal government.

566
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,390
And it's normally not a
pleasant encounter. Like you
said, they're annoyed. Yeah.

567
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,410
You're either annoyed or scared. Uh,
it could be an awesome experience.

568
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:06,800
It could be like, wow, the government is
looking out for me. This is efficient.

569
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,910
This is a decent use of tax dollars.
But instead I get the opposite feeling.

570
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,220
I'm discussed that every time
I go through with that. Well,

571
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,840
it's the same with tourists.

572
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:18,110
Like people come to the U S and they don't
want to come back because if you're a

573
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,620
visitor,
you get treated even worse.

574
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:23,090
If you're like automatically you get
the Kiefer Sutherland treatment and like

575
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:27,830
they think you're a threat until
you prove otherwise. Yeah. We're,

576
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,310
we're a nation of cons.

577
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,320
I don't think I'm watching it. I'm not
going to campaign on that. Don't do it.

578
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:39,330
It wouldn't help. But it's, it's, it's
so frustrating. It's really frustrating.

579
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:43,140
We will stop and think about it. Could
you imagine the baby's war terrorist?

580
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,900
Oh Gosh. It's terrible. First,

581
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:49,420
the first terrible thing is that we
have to worry about someone pulling, uh,

582
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,640
you know, a stunt like
that, that dude did, uh,

583
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,050
when to tried to light his underwear
on fire. What is he trying to do?

584
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,890
Lighter shoes on fire from that guy on.
Everybody had to take their shoes off.

585
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:03,150
The thing with al Qaeda is they really
don't seem to try the same thing multiple

586
00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:06,120
times.
Like nine 11 happened.

587
00:32:06,121 --> 00:32:09,200
If we're going to just stick with the
official story and not delve into crazy

588
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,890
alternative possibilities,

589
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:14,640
which are definitely possibilities based
on the research. I've done. But uh,

590
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,870
if you're going with the official story,
uh,

591
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:20,850
this took them years to plan out and it
works. Not because they were geniuses.

592
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:25,110
It works because it's like running up
to the biggest kid on the playground and

593
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,980
just unexpectedly kicking him in the nuts.
Like,

594
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,010
that's going to work because
he's not expecting it. You know,

595
00:32:29,011 --> 00:32:30,990
it's not going to work a
second time or third time.

596
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,570
But they did something that was totally
unexpected and that's why it worked.

597
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,560
Not because they were brilliant
masterminds and then they try completely

598
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:44,270
different, you know, the underwear
bomb or the a shoe bomb and that's it.

599
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,520
Next time we shouldn't even be
looking at airports. Honestly,

600
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:48,350
the next threat is going to be something,
whatever it is,

601
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,080
I would put my money up being something
completely different from that.

602
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,750
Yeah. And then the idea is that the
more rights they take away from us,

603
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,800
the less likely that is to happen.

604
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,250
But it's still real bad guys.
Real bad.

605
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,060
Whether or not something's going
to happen is that illegal legal,

606
00:33:04,061 --> 00:33:08,810
the pet on the next year.
Crazy. A crepe. Creepy pastor.

607
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,540
You can't do that. Man, I can't bet on
shit. Although there are like in London,

608
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:16,150
there's that bedding house where you
can bet on anything and he'd be like,

609
00:33:16,151 --> 00:33:17,350
what are the odds that Madonna,

610
00:33:17,351 --> 00:33:21,760
we'll get like an STD in the next 18
months and there's an, or whatever it is,

611
00:33:21,761 --> 00:33:26,050
there's a wager on it in England and
help do that kind of stuff like that.

612
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,160
Those crazy bets.

613
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,050
Good idea. I'm sure he would. Yeah. Stan
herb and I, by the way, are doing a,

614
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:36,790
uh, end of the year, um,
December 21st end of the world,

615
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,000
Mayan calendar,
apocalypse show in Hollywood.

616
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,110
We're going to do it at the Wiltern
theater in Hollywood. It's going to be me,

617
00:33:44,111 --> 00:33:49,090
Joey Diaz, Stan hope and honey honey.
Wow. That's going to be so fucking great.

618
00:33:49,091 --> 00:33:52,900
Yeah, we're working it all out now, but
it'll be at the Wiltern December 21st.

619
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:56,290
I don't think tickets are not on sale yet,
but it's going to be fucking crazy. Oh.

620
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,330
And we're at the ice house this
weekend. We had to cancel, um,

621
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,790
this show at Mandalay Bay because of the
UFC got cancelled the first time ever.

622
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,150
And, uh, so we moved the
show to the ice house.

623
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:10,900
Friday is 10 o'clock and
Saturday is 10 30, I believe.

624
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,450
Or is it the other way around?

625
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:17,560
Tenish ice has comedy.com to get tickets
to their greatest club in the world.

626
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:21,730
This place, it's, it's run by the
nicest people ever. It's in Pasadena.

627
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,880
And the, uh, the way this
place is set up, it's,

628
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:28,990
it's basically the same club that
was here in the 1960s. It's amazing.

629
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,980
It's like a slice of history and a, and
we love it. So we hear all the time.

630
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:37,250
So this weekend it'd be
me, Joey, and Ari and, uh,

631
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:39,720
it will be just like a regular real show,
you know what I'm saying?

632
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,400
Or it's just come on down. So, uh,
David Seaman, I'm sorry. We, we, uh,

633
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:48,900
we went off track there. No,
you've been a, you've been
off bear for a while, right?

634
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:51,510
So you're trying to catch up. Yeah. Yeah.

635
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:56,190
We were in a vacation mode last week.
So you're,

636
00:34:56,191 --> 00:35:01,170
um, you're, you're running for Congress
out of Florida. Yes sir. And when you're,

637
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:04,620
when you're doing that, what do you have
to do? Like how do you get your word out?

638
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,560
Do you or do you go door to door?
Like how do you let people know?

639
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:10,980
Do you just put out an internet videos?
Like what's your method of a,

640
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,840
I never leave the apartment now I believe,
you know,

641
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,440
like right now we're actually
trying to build national awareness.

642
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:21,400
So it does involve a lot of internet
stuff and doing TV shows and local radio

643
00:35:21,401 --> 00:35:25,330
shows and uh, that's the best way to hit
people. Like it makes you sound like,

644
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,540
uh, like you're lazy and
you're like, I just do that.

645
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:32,980
But I mean we also go out and talk to
actual people and shake hands and all that

646
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:35,950
stuff. But you do that, you're
exhausted by the end of the day.

647
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,090
You've talked to some crazy,
you've only made a difference.

648
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,840
You've made a difference of like,
now 20 people know who you are.

649
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,110
Versus like somebody who's like, you want
to do a radio show and like, you know,

650
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:49,830
they call your cell phone and you, you
lie and say it's a land line. Because,

651
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,830
you know,
they call your cell phone,

652
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,940
you talk to some dude for 10
minutes and you're like, okay,

653
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:56,700
now 10,000 people in this
area know about my campaign.

654
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,470
That's a hell of a lot better than
shaking hands with the crazy people. Yeah.

655
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,080
But you need to do both because you
can't be this disconnected like media

656
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:06,270
personality. You have to actually
know what you're talking about.

657
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,280
Especially when somebody
hits you with a local issue,

658
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:09,450
you gotta be right on top of that.

659
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,390
And the best way to know about
that is by talking to people. Yeah,

660
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:15,720
that's a really good point man.
So it's not either or. It's both.

661
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,770
You know that you gotta be hands on and
you also have to be the online method of

662
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:25,500
distribution is the new way. I mean
for everything for standup comedy for,

663
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:27,600
and you still gotta you still
gotta suck up to mainstream media.

664
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:30,410
Even though I hate them.
I was like,

665
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,680
I mean CNN and Msnbc won't have me.
I don't think they'll have me on,

666
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:35,430
cause I've trashed them
so many times on Twitter.

667
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,520
But there are a couple of cable networks
that liked me and having me on and

668
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:41,760
they're like my lifeblood for getting
the word out about this stuff. You know?

669
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:46,820
What is your main beef with
mainstream news? What is a,

670
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,630
what is the main problem you have with it?

671
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,200
A total lack of a sense of scale.

672
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,950
Like there'll be like we have
controversial, controversial,

673
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:58,950
new tweets from Justin Bieber after
the break and you're like, you're like,

674
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,700
you're like, this is really Fox News
or this is really MSNBC, you know?

675
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,690
Or like Paul Ryan's budget plan might
affect us in 10 years and you're like,

676
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,280
okay, let's, that's fine for a segment.

677
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,520
But what about covering the massive
protests that are happening around the

678
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:15,060
country that I have to tune in to on
like some live streams site that somebody

679
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:18,450
sends me an email and I
see people not much older,

680
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,910
not much younger than me getting
the shit kicked out of them,

681
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,420
especially girls for some reason. I see
a lot of that and this is all happening.

682
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:25,590
I'm like,
this is incredible.

683
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:28,560
And you look at the bottom and it's
like 6,000 people watching 7,000 people

684
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:31,170
watching 8,000 people watching
and you're like, any second,

685
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:33,720
this is going to be on CNN and
I've done this a million times.

686
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:36,990
You turn on the TV and you're like,
okay, say something about the protests,

687
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,720
not a single word. And it starts
to creep you out and you're like,

688
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:42,510
maybe they know about this and they're
just not saying anything because a lot of

689
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:43,440
people send in tips.

690
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:48,330
A lot of people tweet CNN and
email CNN and a email producers,

691
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:50,610
they're like,
I know how to work with TV producers.

692
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:53,790
If for some reason those handful of
networks just don't want to cover what's

693
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:57,090
happening in this country.
They don't want to cover a civil unrest.

694
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,640
They don't wanna cover police beating
people and they don't want to cover

695
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:03,180
anything that Congress has been working
on over the past eight months. Uh,

696
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:07,770
I've not heard much coverage of
this stuff. Yeah, it's disturbing.

697
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:11,430
When you find out how
many different places are
experiencing this massive amount

698
00:38:11,431 --> 00:38:14,070
of civil unrest,
it's happening all over the world.

699
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,120
I think they can just control it.

700
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:18,660
Like if it's not until it's on the
evening news, it's not really a thing.

701
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,960
Like somebody might, you know, post
about it on Twitter or Facebook,

702
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:24,540
but you're able to, it's not legit.
Yeah. You're able to cognitively be like,

703
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:28,200
well that's just Chris or that's just
Amy there. They've always been Weirdos,

704
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:32,040
you know. And then once it's on TV, it's
real because it's this collective thing.

705
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,770
And a, just a quick
shout out, a current TV

706
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,090
and our current TV and rt
America have kicked ass.

707
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,910
They're actually covering this stuff.
They're covering the protests.

708
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,360
They had been covering Nda and uh,
uh,

709
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:49,630
Sopa and Cisco and all of these crazy
bills that Congress is working on.

710
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,800
They're actually doing what all the TV
networks, uh, used to do. Well, you know,

711
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:57,070
we can do is all of us can start
paying attention to them and not paying

712
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:58,590
attention to exactly.
Exactly.

713
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,850
We have to figure out who
the fuck has a Nielsen box

714
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,970
get inside that guy's head and go, listen
man. CNNS ratings are down tremendously.

715
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:10,170
The down like 50% over the past year.
Really. And it gives her science,

716
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,320
cause people just don't buy it anymore.

717
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:15,190
They're always going to have that
person out there who wants to watch, uh,

718
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,190
like a political shout
fest, you know? Right.

719
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,300
But there are a lot of people who would
just rather look for news on Twitter or

720
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:23,800
look for news on Google News.
I mean at least Google News.

721
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:27,910
Like you type in protest and you see
real articles about what's happening. Uh,

722
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:29,560
so it's a better way to
get your information.

723
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:33,310
Do you think what's happening is that
because of the spread of information

724
00:39:33,311 --> 00:39:36,460
through the Internet and we've realized
how they've done business as usual the

725
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:37,294
whole time,

726
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:41,800
they have denied attention to a
lot of really important things,

727
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:44,290
but we didn't have any other
way to get the information out.

728
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,900
Like if there's something
happening in the Congo,

729
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:51,220
like I didn't know anything about
Liberia until I watched the vice guide to

730
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:54,220
Liberia and I was like,
Holy Shit.

731
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,070
Like what a crazy part of the world.
This is.

732
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,350
Why didn't I get that from any
other sources as well, you know? No,

733
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,700
their sources had it on and
it was not on CNN. It wasn't,

734
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,290
I mean they wouldn't air a show like that.

735
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,430
It's almost like in in
them having the power,

736
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,160
they ultimately became corrupt.
Even if you have the,

737
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,110
your idea is that you want to,
you know,

738
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,120
do some sort of a news thing if
you're not monitored, if no one, no.

739
00:40:20,121 --> 00:40:23,410
Like in the day back now,
everything is so transparent.

740
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,090
But back then you weren't monitored.
You put on whatever you wanted to put on.

741
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:31,360
Whenever the government told you to put
on whatever deals he had made the put on.

742
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,790
I think you're partially right.

743
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:37,870
I think a part of the reason why we feel
like there's so much bad stuff going on

744
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:40,780
today is that we have access to it.
And back then you had three,

745
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,940
three TV networks,
not even cable.

746
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,030
You just said that the three networks
and they told you what you were supposed

747
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:49,150
to be worried about and that was it.
Alice, you're going gonna get information,

748
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,740
the newspapers and same thing there.

749
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,910
But I think also there's a big aspect of
it that things really are accelerating.

750
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,020
And getting worse.

751
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,810
Some of those things they're drafting
and congress are things that a previous

752
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:01,060
generation would have just said,
hell no.

753
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,540
Like this is like the people in Congress
wouldn't have thought of drafting it

754
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:08,950
and people hearing about it one way or
another would have not tolerated it well.

755
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,390
We have a much higher tolerance right now
for corruption and for bad legislation

756
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:17,590
than we used to. Is that because we're
too distracted? What do you think? That's,

757
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,670
that's my guess is we're distracted and
things were still good right now for a

758
00:41:21,671 --> 00:41:25,620
lot of people, like if you can
pay your rent and uh, you know,

759
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,690
you can watch a hundred
channels on online or on cable,

760
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:31,750
you're constantly entertained and as long
as you're not starving and as long as

761
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:34,190
you're not bored,
you're not going to go out in the streets

762
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,891
and protests,

763
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:38,750
losing your right to a trial or losing
any of these things that we've lost over

764
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:39,584
the past eight months.

765
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,920
And that's with a lot of people don't
realize is national defense authorization

766
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:47,240
act that got passed, which is what
really is, is an act of treason.

767
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,090
I mean it's, it's, you could think
of no other way to describe it

768
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,890
to be high treason. Like that's
what I'm saying. Like if this,

769
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:58,080
if in the sixties or the seventies,
uh, if the people found out that, oh,

770
00:41:58,081 --> 00:41:58,651
by the way,

771
00:41:58,651 --> 00:42:01,920
a Kennedy drafted something that
would take away your right to a trial,

772
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,000
allow him, knew, imprison you on
suspicion alone for the rest of your life.

773
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,930
People would be like, what? No way
that we're supposed to trust them.

774
00:42:09,931 --> 00:42:12,420
That they're only going to use
it on people who deserve it.

775
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,570
They're only going to do it on bad
guys. It doesn't happen. Don't,

776
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,920
don't worry about it, Mike. It
doesn't, it's not about you.

777
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:21,130
We're just worried about terrorists.
We're not going to use to say, oh yeah,

778
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,090
and also that's, that's not the role of
the government the first place. It's like,

779
00:42:24,091 --> 00:42:26,160
it's not,
it's like I'm going to have a,

780
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,290
I'm going to have your girlfriend
and my bed, but don't worry about it.

781
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,640
Nothing's going to
happen. It's like, well,

782
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,640
that's not an option in the
first place. Yeah. You know,

783
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,260
you doing these things is not something
that's constitutional begin with.

784
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:36,000
So your intentions don't really matter.

785
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,330
It's frightening that
that could ever get past.

786
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:43,740
It's really frightening and it just
shows you how when people are in power,

787
00:42:43,741 --> 00:42:44,760
when they're in positions of power,

788
00:42:44,761 --> 00:42:49,050
they do everything they possibly can to
hold it and we'll you sense a trend of

789
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,150
this,
what the trend is.

790
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:55,050
Information is coming in and people are
having much more access to all sorts of

791
00:42:55,051 --> 00:42:59,550
things and ultimately the Internet is
going to represent how people communicate

792
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:04,080
and how people express anything, whether
it's voting, whether it's decided.

793
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,840
I mean that's how it should be.
It should pretty sure if she'll be,

794
00:43:06,841 --> 00:43:10,890
we should be able to figure out how
to make each human being have a bio

795
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:12,900
identifiable characteristic.

796
00:43:12,901 --> 00:43:15,450
Whether it's looking in their
eyes are registering their finger.

797
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,390
You everybody should have that shit on
their fucking laptop and we should all be

798
00:43:18,391 --> 00:43:21,480
able to vote online because then
things would be a whole lot different.

799
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,430
That is the future and they don't
have that yet and it's real close.

800
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,440
So these fucking assholes that are running
things are just holding on tooth and

801
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:31,861
claw.

802
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:35,550
And the way they're doing that is by
pulling rights away and they're doing it

803
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:40,110
under the guise of, of helping
us, which is fucking disgusting.

804
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,410
It is. And I have a theory that I've
never said anywhere else before,

805
00:43:43,411 --> 00:43:46,680
but you were talking about how, uh,
you know, they're taking away rights.

806
00:43:46,681 --> 00:43:49,380
People are kind of wising up and
they're no longer tolerating it because

807
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:54,270
information is getting out. Uh, I
wouldn't stay click my reputation on this,

808
00:43:54,271 --> 00:43:58,830
but my theory is that, uh, it got to
the point with Bush eight years of Bush,

809
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,460
it's where the, they knew that the
people just were not having it anymore.

810
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:06,090
They're sick of funding wars.
They're sick of this Patriot Act stuff,

811
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,920
the whole thing. Right. Uh,

812
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:12,000
and then Obama came along draped and hope
and change and very positive message.

813
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,250
And uh,

814
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,830
people put their support behind them
and thought they were getting something

815
00:44:16,831 --> 00:44:21,170
brand new. And when really he's backed
by the same people who backed Bush,

816
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,790
essentially the same
kinds of interests and a,

817
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:27,050
so you had a couple of years there
where people let their guard down and

818
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,150
meanwhile the same stuff has been
happening, taking away more rights.

819
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,340
The Patriot Act not stopped being used.

820
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,760
A 300,000 people have been around
300,000 people have been served nsls uh,

821
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:40,440
and they might be spying on
hundreds of millions of Americans.

822
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,600
I had so much more confidence in us when
I was really young during the Clinton

823
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:46,434
administration.

824
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:50,380
I had so much more confidence in what
the government would and wouldn't do to

825
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,580
civilians to its
civilization. I remember, uh,

826
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,970
I remember this girl in my class,

827
00:44:56,971 --> 00:45:01,971
her dad worked on the Hubble
Space Telescope and he
came to our school to talk

828
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:06,660
about it and like there was a camera crew
there from the TV stations and stuff.

829
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,490
I remember thinking how cool this is.

830
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:12,750
Like government is funding this crazy
thing that is going to make a difference

831
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:16,410
in like move us forward. You
know, it's like, this is amazing.

832
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:18,660
And now I don't feel that
way about a lot of programs.

833
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:22,830
Like now I'm constantly
being sent articles where
you just kind of a disbelief

834
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:26,730
like the, you've probably
read about this, the DRP,

835
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:31,320
the national defense
resources preparedness, uh,
executive order. What is that?

836
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:36,710
So a reader sent this to me and you
always follow tips regardless of what they

837
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:41,850
are. I read through this thing, it's
an executive order from Obama and uh,

838
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,570
I was like, this is, this is bullshit.
This must be made up somehow.

839
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,350
But then I went on the White House website
on whitehouse.gov where they have to

840
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:52,830
publish the executive order is word for
word. I read through it and I was like,

841
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:56,670
Whoa, this makes no sense. He's claiming
powers that no president should claim.

842
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,210
The ability to,
uh,

843
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,580
nationalize whole companies are
nationalized industries and take personal

844
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:06,060
property and land and really take in,

845
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:08,100
do whatever his administration wants.

846
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:11,100
All they have to do is claim they're
preparing for a national emergency.

847
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,940
There doesn't have to be
proof that there's a national
emergency on the way that

848
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:17,380
doesn't actually have to be
a national emergency. Uh,

849
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,270
the national emergency can just be him
declaring that there might be one of the

850
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:23,760
national emergency could be the
threat of terrorist. Yeah, exactly.

851
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:26,900
It could be just this looming threat
of terrorism and then it's white.

852
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,770
So I'm sorry.
But that's,

853
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:31,080
that's the scariest thing about
having that sort of an enemy.

854
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:33,150
You can kind of claim it's everywhere,
right?

855
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,660
Well and the NDA part of the
languages until hostilities end.

856
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,950
So what does that mean?
It's like when,

857
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:41,400
when there's not a single
violent person on the earth,

858
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,710
whoever commits a crime or
turns to violence against
innocent people, then we'll,

859
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:48,810
we'll stop detaining
people without a trial.

860
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,320
What is the exact language until
has still yes. Go on. Go on.

861
00:46:52,321 --> 00:46:55,740
Belligerent act.org. I'm not
affiliated with them, but uh,

862
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,980
it's just this one page site does a
great job of breaking down the exact

863
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:03,780
language until hostilities.
That so creepy. Can you
bring that up and uh, sure.

864
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:07,230
Read it. Cause they do a good
job of highlighting this.
It again, it's belligerent,

865
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:10,860
act.org
because there are a lot of people,

866
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,530
when I was covering this stuff with like,
I want to see the exact language,

867
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,270
you don't know what you're talking
about, and I was like, well,

868
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,500
this is based on the [inaudible] analysis
and Amnesty International's analysis

869
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:21,480
and you know, et Cetera.
They're like, I don't care.

870
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:22,800
I still want to see the exact language.

871
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:26,970
Belligerent and that website does
a good job of showing people like,

872
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:30,070
here are the exact words that
were signed into that affect

873
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,220
you. I don't want to read this
man. I'm going to get depressed.

874
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,880
I can't get a lot of the rich, you
can't spell belligerent. He sleep bitch.

875
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,460
It's two L's.

876
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,493
Oh,

877
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,160
be contained indefinitely without
trial. Wow. It's just so weird.

878
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:55,100
It makes it legal to incarcerate United
States citizens without recourse to any

879
00:47:55,101 --> 00:47:59,780
form of judicial process. Just that alone.
Yeah. That's crazy. What do you mean?

880
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:00,990
Why do we have a,

881
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,320
why don't we have a judicial branch
if you're not going to use it?

882
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:08,270
The idea that you would allow someone
to sign a law that says they can

883
00:48:08,271 --> 00:48:12,980
incarcerate United States citizens
without recourse of any form.

884
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,780
There's nothing you can do.

885
00:48:14,781 --> 00:48:17,810
They can lock you up for the rest of your
life and that's written down somewhere

886
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,970
and we're just,
because it's written down somewhere,

887
00:48:19,971 --> 00:48:21,650
that doesn't mean it's not crazy,

888
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,790
but the fact that they even thought
that they could be able to pass that,

889
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,430
that that would be something that
you could put into law. What,

890
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,650
what life in prisons. Not Enough.
We already have that. You know,

891
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:35,690
it was there that Martin Luther king
quote talks about how he talks about how

892
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,230
there's a difference between,
uh,

893
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:43,610
breaking the law and like abiding, I'm
missing it. Messing up his quote entirely.

894
00:48:43,611 --> 00:48:46,190
It basically like, just because
it's a law doesn't make it just,

895
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,730
and just because it's just, it might
not necessarily be the law, you know,

896
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,650
you might be doing something
that's against the law,

897
00:48:51,651 --> 00:48:52,970
but it's the just thing to do.

898
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:56,480
And at the same time a law might be
profoundly unjust just because somebody

899
00:48:56,481 --> 00:48:58,040
signed a piece of paper,
as you said,

900
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:01,580
that doesn't mean that we should ruin
thousands of people's lives over it.

901
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:06,470
It's completely ridiculous and it's the
only reason why it's here is because

902
00:49:06,471 --> 00:49:10,370
this is the old way. This
is the way things were done,
the way things were done,

903
00:49:10,371 --> 00:49:15,371
it was very difficult to change laws
and things were written in fucking stone

904
00:49:15,501 --> 00:49:20,180
and that was what it was.
And people are evolving,

905
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,530
culture's evolving.

906
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:26,560
Our understanding of our world is changing
and ever moving forward and our laws

907
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:30,880
should reflect that. And it
shouldn't be the opposite of that if,

908
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:32,840
if there's a tightening down.
Well,

909
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:37,841
that to me is a great example of how
there's someone who doesn't get it and

910
00:49:38,301 --> 00:49:41,480
there's someone who doesn't get it, is
the people that are actually running shit,

911
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,960
they have the wrong intentions.
They're not looking at this correctly.

912
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,640
You shouldn't be trying to tighten up.

913
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,910
You should be trying to help all the
things that are fucked up about the world.

914
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,340
That's what we should be
using our resources for,

915
00:49:52,341 --> 00:49:56,180
and there's money in that as well. By
the way, there's jobs in that as well,

916
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,310
by the way.
There's jobs in any direction you take.

917
00:49:58,311 --> 00:50:00,710
I mean the t the TSA is creating jobs.

918
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:05,480
I'd rather see people employ more,
employ more people over at NASA.

919
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,190
I would like to see that too.

920
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:10,130
I would like to see that much more than
I would like to see us go into foreign

921
00:50:10,131 --> 00:50:11,630
countries and invade their soil.

922
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:16,340
But I think what's really scary to me
is that people are allowed to make these

923
00:50:16,341 --> 00:50:19,670
decisions without the will of
the American people behind them.

924
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:24,090
This is literally drafted behind
closed doors and people had no input.

925
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:28,130
It's terrifying.
And how did find out about this?

926
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,890
A reader sent me a thing about it
and it was, it was a link to a,

927
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:36,720
an article that wired had done
back in I think early December.

928
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:39,930
It might've even been November.
And so I did a youtube video about it.

929
00:50:39,931 --> 00:50:43,920
I did some articles and I felt like
there's no way this thing will actually

930
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:45,480
become law,
but it's still disturbing.

931
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:48,720
I have to keep an eye on it and
tell people about it. And then, uh,

932
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:52,830
Obama Obama came out and
said his administration came
out and so that they were

933
00:50:52,831 --> 00:50:55,890
going to veto it. And then I was like, all
right, good. This is what should happen.

934
00:50:55,891 --> 00:50:59,340
You know, something ridiculous as proposed
and they say, we're not signing this.

935
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,650
And then on New Year's Eve a while,

936
00:51:01,651 --> 00:51:04,800
everybody's out drinking and not
paying attention to these things,

937
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,750
he signed it into law. And then after that
I took some heat for that and he said,

938
00:51:09,751 --> 00:51:12,030
well, I'm not going to use
what I just signed into law.

939
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:13,230
I'm not going to use that section.

940
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,860
And he issued a signing statement saying
that he wasn't gonna use it. But, uh,

941
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,720
the problem with that is
it's not legally valid.

942
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,400
It's like doing something and then
putting a post it note on somebodies door

943
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,820
saying, sorry about that. Like the
signing statement is not a [inaudible].

944
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,270
Legally they said he wouldn't
sign it and he signed it.

945
00:51:28,271 --> 00:51:30,690
Why am I going to believe that he's not
going to use it after he said he's not

946
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:35,760
right. And then it gets even worse
because then it goes to federal court. Uh,

947
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:39,200
plaintiffs including a
former war correspondent, uh,

948
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,720
Chris Hedges used to work at
the New York Times and, uh,

949
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,620
Daniel Ellsberg who leaked
the Pentagon papers. Uh,

950
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,290
these are pretty credible people.
These aren't like quacks, you know, uh,

951
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,050
they filed a court case thinking,
uh,

952
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,220
with the intention of blocking this
because they said that MDA could basically

953
00:51:56,221 --> 00:51:58,770
endanger their safety and the
safety of any journalist. You know,

954
00:51:58,771 --> 00:52:00,330
if the government doesn't want
you talking about something,

955
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:03,570
let's just detain them without
a trial problem solved. Uh,

956
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:09,570
and the federal court judge
Catherine forest ruled it
unconstitutional. So again,

957
00:52:09,571 --> 00:52:12,780
it should have stopped there.
But Obama's administration,

958
00:52:12,781 --> 00:52:16,620
his lawyers are now appealing that, uh,
appealing that temporary injunction.

959
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,680
And so every single step of the way,
you're like, wait, if he doesn't want it,

960
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,390
why does it keep pushing for it?
You know,

961
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:24,710
so disturbing.

962
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:29,780
So it's just reeks of corruption and
it reeks of the worst intentions.

963
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,600
It reeks of looking at us like we're
sheep to be control of the intentions are

964
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:37,060
to crush dissent to cross.

965
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,780
There's the assumption that these
protests will continue to grow in,

966
00:52:41,781 --> 00:52:45,800
in relevance and in size, and there's
the assumption that the economy,

967
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,860
if there's not some kind of
economic collapse, who knows?

968
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:53,210
It could just be years of slow employment
and years of people being unsatisfied

969
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,670
and that's,
even if that's not a total calamity,

970
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
that's still a breeding ground for like
mass civil unrest and they've think if

971
00:53:01,581 --> 00:53:04,940
we have this ability to imprison people
without a trial, just on our say,

972
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:07,340
so that's going to crush
dissent pretty fast.

973
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:08,810
The first thousand people will be arrested

974
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,040
and put in prison.
That's the end of it.

975
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:12,800
No more protesters because nobody else
is going to go out of their house. Well,

976
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:16,520
what's crazy though is that the people
who are arresting the people are on the

977
00:53:16,521 --> 00:53:20,210
same side as those people.
They're just people that are working,

978
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:23,210
they're working folks,
the cops and the soldiers.

979
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,890
Those aren't the people
pulling the fuck strings.

980
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,990
The people that are going
to have to do the arresting,

981
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:30,690
whether it's military police
or whether it's regular police,

982
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,830
those are just fucking citizens with jobs.
They're not the power problem.

983
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,470
They're not the people
making the actual calls.

984
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:42,120
That's a small group of people that
we could easily overpower. Yeah.

985
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,000
Well that's why I was not,
I'm not calling for a revolution

986
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,410
when I have,
when I have trouble with the TSA.

987
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,410
Well now that I'm running for Congress,

988
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,990
like it's a little bit better because
if they, if they harass me too much,

989
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,090
they're actually interfering
with the democratic process.

990
00:53:55,091 --> 00:53:58,900
Like they're making it so that I can so
that I can't catch my flight and can't

991
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:02,290
go to a fundraiser. I can't go to a media
interview. That's a big deal, you know.

992
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,610
Has anyone ever done that? No. It's been
pretty good. Uh, do you worry about that?

993
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:08,800
I don't worry about it.
I'm just, uh, what I,

994
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,960
what I worry about is what I
actually experienced every time,

995
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:15,070
which is I politely opt out of the
new screeners because those give off

996
00:54:15,071 --> 00:54:17,860
radiation and they'd
been banned in Europe.

997
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,580
The European Union has banned this kind
of scanner cause they don't know the

998
00:54:21,581 --> 00:54:24,790
long term health effects of
shooting radiation into your body.

999
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:28,630
A backscatter radiation. Uh, it,
it's a different form of radiation.

1000
00:54:28,631 --> 00:54:32,020
Then a chest x rays, I believe,
I'm not an expert on this,

1001
00:54:32,021 --> 00:54:33,670
but it's different because
it's doing a different thing.

1002
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:37,660
It's taking a photo of basically the
outside of you instead of just blasting

1003
00:54:37,661 --> 00:54:41,560
right through your body to show your
bones on an x ray. So as a result,

1004
00:54:41,561 --> 00:54:44,110
it's a different kind of
radiation. And uh, so anyway,

1005
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,660
these machines freak me out
to the point where I don't,

1006
00:54:46,661 --> 00:54:50,560
my testicles going through that, uh,
every single time I get on a flight.

1007
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:52,960
So I politely opt out and there's
a sign right there that says,

1008
00:54:52,961 --> 00:54:57,880
if you'd like to opt out, let us know.
Uh, I opt out and then you're treated,

1009
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:01,420
uh, in a way that's not very good.
They say, we have an opt out, sir.

1010
00:55:01,421 --> 00:55:04,540
Stand over there like you've
done something wrong, right?
It's not like, okay, cool.

1011
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:06,820
Just give us a second. We'll get
to it. It's all about the attitude.

1012
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,010
They said we have an opt out.
Stand over there.

1013
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:12,970
And then travelers behind you see
that going on and they're like, shit,

1014
00:55:12,971 --> 00:55:14,800
I'm not going to opt out.
I'm just going to go through this thing.

1015
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,420
And I'm gonna let my
kids go through it too.

1016
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,540
I think that's what they're
trying to get. Yeah. No.

1017
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:22,450
And then you get the invasive pat down
where you have to put your arms up by

1018
00:55:22,451 --> 00:55:25,960
your sides and you put your arms down
after a couple of minutes because you're

1019
00:55:25,961 --> 00:55:28,750
tired and you've just been on a long or
you're about to get on a long flight.

1020
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:31,750
And uh, they say sir, hands back up,

1021
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:37,650
put them back up and they guy sticks
his fingers down your belt and a ahead.

1022
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:41,820
It was belt. Yes, he does. He do like
a scissors on the tip of your director.

1023
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,870
He actually does touch the tip,

1024
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,580
like you feel you feel pressure
against the tip of your penis.

1025
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:52,270
Wow. And that's too much
for the government to be
doing. That's not their role.

1026
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:53,310
You know,
uh,

1027
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:56,770
like it's great that you're trying to
keep us safe and trying to keep airports

1028
00:55:56,771 --> 00:56:00,550
curity at a high level. That's not
your role. Nobody asks you to do that.

1029
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:04,360
You shouldn't be doing that.
It's unconstitutional. And
so every time I'm like,

1030
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,450
should I just go through the fucking
scanner and get it over with?

1031
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,660
But every time I go, no, I have
to hold to this. Cause if you,

1032
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:15,880
if you give them a pass on this, then at
what point do you just lose all of your,

1033
00:56:15,881 --> 00:56:18,280
uh, your compass there, you know?

1034
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,860
Yeah,
I could see people like pilots and,

1035
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,040
and people that didn't actually
have to go through it, right?

1036
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,290
They have a different line.
They have a different line.

1037
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:28,120
And also if you pay
something like 100 bucks,

1038
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:31,570
you can now get an expedited screening.
Got To do a background check beforehand.

1039
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:35,110
I find that profoundly unconstitutional
to cause you're classing citizens,

1040
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:38,170
what does this, the titanic, you know,
if you have extra disposable income,

1041
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,290
we're not going to screen you as
closely as the masses. It's ridiculous.

1042
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:43,210
I can't agree more.
I think it's so weird.

1043
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,600
I was a in London the other day and
I was really tempted to do it because

1044
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:48,580
there's two who's just,
there's a big ass line.

1045
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:52,240
This dude just walked in with
that pre and snuck right through.

1046
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:55,150
Didn't even have to take his shoes
off. It was like, but I'm just like,

1047
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:57,820
what kind of access to they have when you,

1048
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:02,600
what do they look for when you go in
and submit something like that and know

1049
00:57:02,601 --> 00:57:06,190
want to listen to your cell phone 24,
seven. Is that what you're agreeing to?

1050
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,860
Just so you can, well then make
sure doing that just about, anyway,

1051
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:11,780
that's not really happening.
So

1052
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,870
Nsa thing,
uh,

1053
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,950
there was a video about this and
the New York Times website recently,

1054
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,050
it was an amazing video,

1055
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:24,020
is like eight and a half minutes
long professionally produced, uh,

1056
00:57:24,021 --> 00:57:27,060
where they interviewed
the NSA whistleblower who
everybody's kind of heard

1057
00:57:27,061 --> 00:57:29,060
something about, but you don't
know his actual, you know,

1058
00:57:29,061 --> 00:57:32,330
what he's saying happened.
And this video lays it all out there.

1059
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:33,680
It's amazing journalism.
Like,

1060
00:57:33,681 --> 00:57:36,410
I don't know why the New York Times
didn't put it on their homepage where it

1061
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,210
belonged, but it still
got out there. You know,

1062
00:57:38,211 --> 00:57:41,630
it was on reddit and like all these
social media sites and they did a good job

1063
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:45,250
of showing people that, uh,
I'll just boil it down. Um,

1064
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,810
this NSA whistleblower,
his name is William Binney,

1065
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,860
and he was at that agency for 32 years.
Uh,

1066
00:57:51,861 --> 00:57:55,040
and he was actually the technical
director there, so he was pretty high up.

1067
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,670
He wasn't like just the analyst or
a janitor or something, you know,

1068
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:03,230
he knew what was going on and he's about
as high up as you can get. And, uh,

1069
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,590
so he says that after nine 11,

1070
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:11,390
the NSA went from using their incredible
power to monitor stuff overseas,

1071
00:58:11,391 --> 00:58:13,970
which is their mandate
to do that, uh, you know,

1072
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,320
tap into satellite phones and tap in
overseas internet traffic and all of that

1073
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:22,470
stuff. They went from doing that
to turning this incredible, uh,

1074
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,680
surveillance weapon
against our own people.

1075
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:29,360
And it became a full blown effort to
record pretty much everything that we're

1076
00:58:29,361 --> 00:58:33,080
doing here in the u s uh,
and that includes, uh,

1077
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:37,520
every citizen who has access to the
internet or a cell phone and the way they

1078
00:58:37,521 --> 00:58:40,670
get around this because it appears
to be blatantly unconstitutional.

1079
00:58:40,671 --> 00:58:45,430
The fourth amendment against
unreasonable searches and seizures. Um,

1080
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:49,370
they have an interpretation from what the
whistleblower was saying in this video

1081
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,600
or from the article.

1082
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,780
They have an interpretation that we're
not actually violating your fourth

1083
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:57,710
amendment rights because we're only taking
this information in and storing it in

1084
00:58:57,711 --> 00:59:00,800
our databases. We're not actually,
there's nobody with, you know,

1085
00:59:00,801 --> 00:59:04,340
a pair of headphones and a computer
screen in front of them who's watching you

1086
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:08,060
type every email and actually
looking through all of your stuff.

1087
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:12,390
We're just saving this. But the
problem with that is it's saved, uh,

1088
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:15,650
and it's tied to your name
and all they have to do.

1089
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:18,410
It's not a big logical leap to think,
uh,

1090
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:21,140
if you're running for Congress and
you might be running on a platform,

1091
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:25,290
you want to doubt, you want to defund some
of these programs, they go, let's look.

1092
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,690
Let's look into this guy.
You know,

1093
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:29,420
they type in your name and they
suddenly see all of your emails,

1094
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:31,820
all of your phone calls,
all of your associations,

1095
00:59:31,821 --> 00:59:33,020
because that's part of what it does.

1096
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:37,250
It does threading and shows your
community who you talk to online, uh,

1097
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:40,730
who you call on your cell
phone. Supposedly that's what
this thing is capable of.

1098
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:43,970
Uh, so it shows them all this
information and they can cherry pick.

1099
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,720
Maybe they go through an email from
three years ago where jokingly I said,

1100
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,440
you know, with a friend, uh, you know,
yeah dude, fuck the u s you know,

1101
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:54,890
and they just quote that I think should
this guy be running for Congress,

1102
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:57,980
you know,
and like bring bogus charges against you.

1103
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:00,950
There's so many ways they can screw you
over when they have access to all of

1104
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:04,630
your information. And so people
out there go, they're not gonna,

1105
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,410
they're not watching me.
And that's true.

1106
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:09,410
Nobody with a pair of headphones is
listening to your every word on the cell

1107
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:11,480
phone. That's not how
this is working. Instead,

1108
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:15,620
it's being archived and giving them
tremendous access to screw you over should

1109
01:00:15,621 --> 01:00:18,530
you become a problem to them. I think
again, that's the power of the government.

1110
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,364
Shouldn't have,

1111
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,210
I couldn't agree more. It's a, and the
government shouldn't want it right now.

1112
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:28,870
I think the real issue is that we've
developed an US versus them divide between

1113
01:00:28,871 --> 01:00:32,290
the government of the people. And he
shouldn't be that at all. You know,

1114
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:35,380
it shouldn't be them defending
their power position. It should be.

1115
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,150
They are us and we,

1116
01:00:37,151 --> 01:00:41,350
they are representatives are us and
they're looking out for us legitimately

1117
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:45,010
right. And clearly that's been
corrupted and that's not good for them.

1118
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,230
It's not good for the people
that are perpetrating.

1119
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:50,860
This is not good for you either, man.
You, you might be profiting off of it,

1120
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:52,450
but it's horrible for your life.

1121
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,730
That's the only,
that's the only ray of uh,

1122
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:59,640
really the only ray of light here is that
this program is so vast and Orwellian

1123
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:02,290
to be honest, if what this
whistleblower says, it's true,

1124
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:07,270
it's so vast that it's also our
calving information on senators and

1125
01:01:07,271 --> 01:01:11,260
representatives and FBI agents,
people at the very top of government.

1126
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:15,730
And those people don't really want
that, you know, they don't want, uh,

1127
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,480
for some agency that's
basically unaccountable to
be able to screw them over at

1128
01:01:19,481 --> 01:01:20,410
any point in the future.

1129
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,550
So I think that's kind of the thing there
that might save us in the end is that

1130
01:01:24,551 --> 01:01:28,660
some powerful people in DC might say,
wait a second, this is totally ridiculous.

1131
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:29,121
Well,

1132
01:01:29,121 --> 01:01:34,121
I know we said that at the end of this
technology connection that we have,

1133
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:38,390
it's gonna, it's gonna rush upon
us so quickly that you're not,

1134
01:01:38,391 --> 01:01:40,760
you're not even gonna know what hit you.
And then at a certain point in time,

1135
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:43,190
there will be no more privacy.
It will won't exist.

1136
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,220
That would be, that would be
something that you can get used to.

1137
01:01:45,221 --> 01:01:49,450
If it was two ways. Yes, I no longer have
any privacy. This is the 21st century.

1138
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:52,630
The government knows and I'm walking
around on the sidewalk and I better not be

1139
01:01:52,631 --> 01:01:55,270
committing a crime against anybody else.
Uh,

1140
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,760
but in exchange I want to
see where our money's going.

1141
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:00,190
I want to see why we need
to still be in Afghanistan.

1142
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:05,050
I want to see why you're
funding a multibillion dollar
storage facility in Utah,

1143
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,930
uh, which the NSA is going to
be using to store all this data.

1144
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,020
Like I want to see the numbers.
So then what's going on right now?

1145
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:14,140
Absolutely happening right
now. It's not a plan. No.

1146
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,560
If you can you actually bring up
the New York Times video. Sure. Uh,

1147
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,980
can you bring it up Brian?
And so we

1148
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:24,310
can see it on the scale. I'll try. It's
called, uh, it's called the program. Um,

1149
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:28,020
so you're freaking me out by the way.
Thanks. This is like the, the first,

1150
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:28,973
I was hoping,

1151
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,370
I was hoping this would a be a good
opportunity to talk about this stuff.

1152
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:35,220
What's it called? Yeah, say it
again. What's it called again?

1153
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:38,610
The article is called like the program.
Just search for the program.

1154
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:40,890
William Binney New York Times.
You just,

1155
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:44,700
you've described it better than any I've
heard anybody describe it in the most

1156
01:02:44,701 --> 01:02:47,660
honest and ominous way.
Right. Well, like that,

1157
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,240
that's the thing about this is it's not,
it's not that right now, by the way,

1158
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:54,210
the NSA supposedly employees,
uh,

1159
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:58,380
they employ more people then
the CIA and the FBI combined.

1160
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,710
So when people say they don't have the
capacity to spy on you, actually they do.

1161
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:05,010
They have the funding and they
have the employees to do it and no,

1162
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:07,890
like they really aren't
listening in on your every word,

1163
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:11,490
like a Jason Bourne movie, what
they're doing. There's the video

1164
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,860
and this is in Bluff Dale, Utah.
For folks that are looking at home,

1165
01:03:17,861 --> 01:03:21,640
we're just looking at some
frozen landscape and it
says following nine 11 the

1166
01:03:21,641 --> 01:03:22,930
national security agency,
Mccann,

1167
01:03:22,931 --> 01:03:26,770
a top secret surveillance program to
spine US citizens without warrants,

1168
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:31,090
Codenames,
stellar wind or the program to insiders.

1169
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,890
The full scope of the surveillance.

1170
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:37,860
This has not been made public.
It is raining Severen Maryland.

1171
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:41,590
There's a man who's doing heroin
now. He needs glasses, king,

1172
01:03:41,591 --> 01:03:44,640
different codes and uh,
and data systems.

1173
01:03:44,641 --> 01:03:48,180
And he's an NSA whistleblower
doing data beneath those lips.

1174
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,100
The Soviet Union,

1175
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,850
he worked at the NSA for 32 years.

1176
01:03:53,851 --> 01:03:57,240
He is regarded as one of
the best mathematicians and
code breakers in the NSA's

1177
01:03:57,241 --> 01:03:58,120
history.
Yep.

1178
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:03,210
They're nine 11 they took one of the
programs I would have done or the backend

1179
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:08,120
part of it and started to use it to
spy on everybody in this country.

1180
01:04:08,121 --> 01:04:10,910
So and that that was a program
they created called stellar wind.

1181
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:15,380
That was the separate and compartmented
from the regular activity that was

1182
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:19,250
ongoing because it was
doing domestic spying.

1183
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:22,280
All the equipment was coming out.
I knew something was happening,

1184
01:04:22,281 --> 01:04:23,210
but then when my,

1185
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,900
the contractors I had hired came and told
me what without what they were doing,

1186
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,190
it was clear where all the hardware was
going and what they were using it to do.

1187
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:37,320
It was simply a different input.
Instead of being foreign,

1188
01:04:37,321 --> 01:04:38,350
it was domestic employees.

1189
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:45,700
Somebody told me to pick him, listen
to what we're saying by my having us,

1190
01:04:45,701 --> 01:04:49,870
even if it's turned off. Yes, here's
the, here's the real grand design.

1191
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:53,140
Every domain,
think of a domain as an activity,

1192
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:59,080
a specific type of activity,
phone call or banking is another domain.

1193
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:04,770
So if you think of graphing
each domain and then each graph,

1194
01:05:05,661 --> 01:05:07,600
then turning it in.
The third dimension.

1195
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:11,980
The trick now is to map through all
the domains and that third dimension,

1196
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:17,550
pulling together all the attributes that
any individual has in every so that now

1197
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:23,611
I can pull your entire life together
from all those domains and map it out and

1198
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:27,910
show your entire life over time.

1199
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:33,100
Jesus Christ, this is crazy. Should
we address this whole thing? Oh,

1200
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,800
let's watch a little bit more,
more frozen landscape.

1201
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:40,300
The NSA is currently building the
country's biggest data storage facility in

1202
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:41,140
bluffed.
Dalian.

1203
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:41,973
Tom,

1204
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:42,661
yeah.

1205
01:05:42,661 --> 01:05:45,480
You got to watch the next two minutes
cause he talks about when the FBI raided

1206
01:05:45,481 --> 01:05:46,314
him.

1207
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:47,300
So

1208
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:51,620
Betty calculates the facility as a
capacity to store 100 years worth of the

1209
01:05:51,621 --> 01:05:53,300
world's electronic communication.

1210
01:05:56,030 --> 01:06:00,170
I don't understand why not. What should
I do? Because what you're saying,

1211
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,370
if it was possible,

1212
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:04,370
it would be revolutionary and people
would have invested interest in preventing

1213
01:06:04,371 --> 01:06:08,660
that from happening. I'm
too old. I'm too old.

1214
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:11,373
Whoa.

1215
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:14,030
I'm too old.
That's a scary thing to say.

1216
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:20,120
I'm not sure how many of you got a
chance to hear Keith Alexander yesterday,

1217
01:06:20,121 --> 01:06:24,290
the head of the NSA.
I talk about the NSA's activities bill,

1218
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:25,520
how do you reconcile,

1219
01:06:25,521 --> 01:06:30,521
is there some way to reconcile general
Alexander statement to that the NSA is

1220
01:06:30,771 --> 01:06:35,150
and keeping track of every American with
the existence of a facility like the

1221
01:06:35,151 --> 01:06:37,980
one in Utah,
NSA charter and it was illegitimate.

1222
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:41,330
My one was to do foreign intelligence
and I was with that all the way and I did

1223
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:42,590
the best I could in their job.

1224
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,980
Unfortunately they took those programs
as I build and turned them on you.

1225
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,530
I'm sorry for that.
I didn't intend that,

1226
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:53,540
but they did that to what
you're describing really
is a hard to reconcile with

1227
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:57,170
the laws as the laws are
generally understood by the
lawyers who work with them.

1228
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,490
Most people are familiar with the
Webster's definition of intercept.

1229
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:04,630
You said 18 has a different
definition and that's uh,

1230
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:08,690
an intercept doesn't take place until
it's actually listened to it until

1231
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,830
somebody puts on,

1232
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:14,450
on some earphones or actually
read some text on a screen.

1233
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:17,720
So you can pull in all the
communications you want.

1234
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:22,580
The acquisition isn't a search in the
querying later on is a search and they can

1235
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:25,910
then keep it in their database and
target after the fact by going back and

1236
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:28,400
conducting data mining searches
afterwards. In other words,

1237
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:32,000
to get the information that they couldn't
target from the outset and there is

1238
01:07:32,001 --> 01:07:33,230
another real problem.

1239
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,880
Unfortunately the software
will want to take some data.

1240
01:07:37,881 --> 01:07:41,210
It will build profiles on
everybody in that data.

1241
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,460
Okay. Jesus Christ,
you're like olive garden.

1242
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:47,750
The purposes to be able to monitor
how they're going to know about me.

1243
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:52,640
Yeah. Sorry to bring the vibe down by
recommending this video. By the way,

1244
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,480
this has been haunting my
dreams like this is real. Yeah,

1245
01:07:56,481 --> 01:07:59,630
but do you think most p look have to
worry about this? Like carrying that?

1246
01:07:59,631 --> 01:08:00,950
They do this about you hold on,
hold on,

1247
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:05,340
turn style you the outline at the life
of everybody in the community and if you

1248
01:08:05,341 --> 01:08:07,260
carry it over time from 2001 up,

1249
01:08:07,261 --> 01:08:12,030
you have that 10 years worth of their
life that you could lay out in a timeline.

1250
01:08:12,031 --> 01:08:13,890
Then involves anybody in the country,

1251
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,980
even senators and House of
Representatives. All of them.

1252
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:23,840
The dangers here are that we fall into
something like a totalitarian state like

1253
01:08:23,841 --> 01:08:26,690
East Germany in July,

1254
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:31,250
2007 the FBI raided the homes of many
and two other NSA whistleblowers. Well,

1255
01:08:31,251 --> 01:08:34,370
they came in guns drawn, you know, in my
house. They didn't do that to the others,

1256
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:35,810
but they did to me, I guess. I Dunno.

1257
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:38,440
They thought I was probably the most
dangerous at all. So I don't know.

1258
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:43,160
I didn't know what was in their minds.
Okay. So, but they did that and,

1259
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:46,520
and they came in and pointed the gun at
me when I was getting out of the shower

1260
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:49,070
at the time. So they pointed a gun right
in my old head, you know what I'm saying?

1261
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:53,800
Hey, so Jesus Christ, I wasn't too upset.

1262
01:08:53,801 --> 01:08:56,750
I just said, uh, yeah, I suppose I
can get it. I could get dressed here,

1263
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:03,010
tried to, they weren't intimidating me
anyway. So Tommy, something that will,

1264
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,030
a intimidating, implicate somebody in
a crime. That's what they asked me.

1265
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:10,060
So I told them what the crime was that
I knew about and that was that, uh,

1266
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:13,740
George Bush and Dick Cheney tenant.

1267
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:17,700
And Aiden conspired to
subvert the constitution and
constitutional process and

1268
01:09:17,701 --> 01:09:19,440
any number of laws.
And here's how they did it.

1269
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:23,070
And I explained stellar wind on my back
porch to all the FBI agents who weren't

1270
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:26,240
cleared.
So he had a problem.

1271
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,600
I created a problem for them because
they had a bunch of people now who aren't

1272
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:33,260
cleared for a very highly classified
only because it was domestic spying.

1273
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:37,010
By the way. What's the reason? It
was highly classified. You know,

1274
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:40,810
they wanted to highly classify the
extreme impeachable crimes, right?

1275
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:41,703
They were committed.

1276
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:46,800
Top Justice Department
officials threatened to
resign in 2004 because stellar

1277
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:50,940
wind violated the law. They're legal
objections to the program or not.

1278
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:55,380
We should take turns. Democracy
need to say, do you read,

1279
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:01,680
do we want our government to have
this data or not? And if, if so,

1280
01:10:01,681 --> 01:10:02,431
if we want them to have it,

1281
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:05,540
then what kind of controls and they have
to be a little bit when we're invisible,

1282
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:07,150
it can't all be done in secret.

1283
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:11,410
It can't have secret interpretations of
laws and run them at secret and not tell

1284
01:10:11,411 --> 01:10:13,710
anybody or can't make up kill list.

1285
01:10:13,711 --> 01:10:17,980
And not telling anybody what the criteria
is for being in the kill is. Okay.

1286
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:18,923
It's raining again.

1287
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:23,960
That's a very, very disturbing. That just
really fucked my head sideways. Well,

1288
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:27,310
when I saw that my initial reaction was
why isn't this on the homepage at the

1289
01:10:27,311 --> 01:10:29,350
New York Times? Like they're
putting their name behind this.

1290
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:32,710
This is real journalism. It just
came out like last week. Uh,

1291
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:36,190
this should be everywhere. That's,
that's the problem I have, by the way,

1292
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:38,420
with some of the mainstream media,
you know,

1293
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:42,070
people have tweeted this video
out to everybody, you know,

1294
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,710
it's gotten out in the media and for
some reason like, oh, this isn't news,

1295
01:10:44,711 --> 01:10:47,890
we're just going to run with
Kim Kardashian was stumbling
out of some nightclub.

1296
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,710
And by the way, they might be
spying on every single person,

1297
01:10:50,711 --> 01:10:55,070
but it's not important. Holy Shit. Uh,
so, well this is not, they might be, it's,

1298
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:59,620
it seems like they are the only, the only
credibility issue is it comes down to,

1299
01:10:59,621 --> 01:11:03,520
do you believe William Binney and the
other whistle blower, Thomas Drake. If,

1300
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:06,880
if this guy's full of Shit, then the
whole story is called an the question,

1301
01:11:06,881 --> 01:11:08,470
but the problem is he
was a very high ranking.

1302
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:12,670
He was there for 32 years and they don't
want psychos work at the NSA like they

1303
01:11:12,671 --> 01:11:14,400
do some pretty serious psychological

1304
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,870
background stuff.
From what I understand.

1305
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:19,110
The other thing on top of that
is this guy was a respected,

1306
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:21,810
brilliant mathematician. He's
like a John Nash, you know,

1307
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:25,680
this isn't some like dumb dude had
got caught up and some paranoia.

1308
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:29,010
It's more like, although I guess
John Nash did exactly do that,

1309
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,190
but the point is he's a very smart
guy who is working at a high level and

1310
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:35,010
despite how intelligent he is,
he realized, wait a second,

1311
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,700
this is just profoundly wrong
and it's not our mandate.

1312
01:11:38,701 --> 01:11:39,810
It's not what we should be doing.

1313
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,640
And I'd love the fact that he explained
it all to the cops as they arrested him.

1314
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:45,771
That's the other thing.

1315
01:11:45,771 --> 01:11:49,200
The FBI agents are already pretty high
up in terms of clearance level and the

1316
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:51,360
fact that that blew their
minds and they're like, wait,

1317
01:11:51,361 --> 01:11:55,440
what is this stellar wind program?
That's scary stuff is scary stuff.

1318
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:59,660
And the, the, the beautiful thing
is when he does explain them,

1319
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:02,780
I mean if you listen to that guy talk,
when he did explain it to them,

1320
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:06,370
I'm sure it made a lot of them questioned
why they were arresting him. Right.

1321
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:09,890
And question whether or not he was in
fact a patriot and not a bad guy. Right.

1322
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,960
Like what we're buying. That's
a red flag word. Why is it,

1323
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,790
why is this old man in the
shower a threat to our security?

1324
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:18,700
Yeah, it sounds ridiculous. I mean
cause he's a super mathematician.

1325
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:21,070
What is he a fucking Batman
comic book character.

1326
01:12:21,071 --> 01:12:24,910
He's gonna fucking develops a mathematical
formula to overthrow the world by

1327
01:12:24,911 --> 01:12:26,320
hacking into your email account.

1328
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:29,140
Come on. Yeah, that video. The video
has been haunting my dreams though.

1329
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:33,280
That's the sand. It's been like, it's kind
of a, it tells you about your friends.

1330
01:12:33,281 --> 01:12:36,250
Like I've been emailing it to people
and when I get an email back saying,

1331
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:39,450
holy shit, that's terrifying. Like good
thing you're running for Congress. Ha Ha.

1332
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
And I'm like, I'm like, you're screwed.
There are real stakes involved.

1333
01:12:45,001 --> 01:12:45,731
Like,
people don't get it.

1334
01:12:45,731 --> 01:12:48,880
Like if you want to keep the same
representatives you have now who were

1335
01:12:48,881 --> 01:12:52,240
supportive of this stuff,
good luck. Well the but uh,

1336
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:55,590
sorry to cut you off. Please
do. Uh, sometimes, uh,

1337
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:57,970
you get an email back or somebody
who's like, whatever dude.

1338
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,530
Like they just don't care.
And I'm like,

1339
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:04,210
how far gone or you that you don't care
about this. Yeah. Those people are silly.

1340
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:05,810
I care about it,
but I don't think I've,

1341
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:10,570
I do anything really insanely wrong
where I'm fearing it. Know what I mean?

1342
01:13:10,571 --> 01:13:13,540
Like I've, I mean, I don't think it's that
big of a deal. It sucks. If it's true,

1343
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:17,340
I wish I would say no, don't do it.
Right. But let me paint a scenario. Cared.

1344
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:18,780
Let me paint a scenario for you.
Okay.

1345
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:20,740
Since you always date all
these lovely ladies. All right.

1346
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:23,440
What if a one of your lovely ladies
would come like you gotta to take a leak?

1347
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:24,220
Yeah.

1348
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:27,440
What if one of you lovely ladies had
come in contact with a certain politician

1349
01:13:27,441 --> 01:13:32,050
now at a very high ranking position and
this guy just decided that he wanted a

1350
01:13:32,051 --> 01:13:32,681
bang your wife,

1351
01:13:32,681 --> 01:13:35,770
so he gets you locked up and put
in jail and you have no recourse.

1352
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:39,490
And he pulls up some email where you
said, you know, something crazy, you know,

1353
01:13:39,491 --> 01:13:42,960
10 years ago,
joking and completely trolling it.

1354
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:44,700
But because of the fact that he asked me,

1355
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:47,800
what has this written down into your name,
that's it going to arrest you. I know.

1356
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:51,790
That's insane. It is. But it's something
that they'd be able to do. Yeah,

1357
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,820
but that's the phrase, you know, I
was watching CNN the other night,

1358
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:55,690
it's not that crazy.

1359
01:13:55,691 --> 01:13:59,710
And this is why I was watching the CNN
the other night and they had a guy who,

1360
01:13:59,711 --> 01:14:00,160
um,

1361
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:04,870
is a cop who is a under questioning for
two people's deaths and they think he

1362
01:14:04,871 --> 01:14:09,740
might've been, uh, like a, a some time
serial killer. And that this cop, uh,

1363
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:14,140
he, uh, there's two people disappeared.
Any of the same story for both of them,

1364
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:18,370
that he dropped him off at the
circle k and a, one of them was a,

1365
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:22,770
a Mexican guy who couldn't speak
English and the other one was this, uh,

1366
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:26,590
this black guy and they think that, uh,
this cop might've killed these people.

1367
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:27,960
And why did he do it?

1368
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:31,170
Because he could because he could because
he had the power is in that position.

1369
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:34,840
He had a gun pulled over the lights go on,
he calls into thing,

1370
01:14:34,841 --> 01:14:37,590
calls in the car and said that, uh, he,

1371
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:41,980
he had two totally different stories and
one story he found the car abandoned.

1372
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:46,090
And in the other story he actually
did a background check on the guy.

1373
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:49,730
So he actually called in a
background check that like the,

1374
01:14:49,731 --> 01:14:53,800
the whole thing is the guy turns out
missing and he has like this cockamamie

1375
01:14:53,801 --> 01:14:58,450
story about taking the guide to the
circleK and calling the circle k and that,

1376
01:14:58,451 --> 01:15:01,540
that record's not on his phone,
you know, is an official phone.

1377
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:05,170
What I'm saying is that this
guy was a cop. They just
decided to kill people. Why?

1378
01:15:05,171 --> 01:15:08,800
Because he had the power of you get
some guys some high position of power,

1379
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,290
one of those little sweet pieces
of ass that you carry around. Dude,

1380
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:14,980
you never know. You never
know. Motherfucker might
just turn on your boxes.

1381
01:15:14,981 --> 01:15:18,850
You can't let someone, you cannot let
someone have that kind of power. They,

1382
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,880
that there's no reason for it.
There's plenty of recourse right now.

1383
01:15:21,881 --> 01:15:23,050
Someone does something wrong.

1384
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:26,800
We don't need to like up the amount of
power that the government has over it.

1385
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:30,060
I guess I have way too big of a,
I had a positive,

1386
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,610
not negative skew being delusional.

1387
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:36,180
I like being delusional with this shit
like it. But you know what? I was in Ohio,

1388
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,910
which,
uh,

1389
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:41,490
I forgot how bad the police state
and Ohio was like everywhere you go,

1390
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,000
you saw cops on the,
on an hour drive from Columbus to date.

1391
01:15:45,001 --> 01:15:48,540
And I had seven p like cop car pulled
on the side of the road with the guns

1392
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:52,620
pointing at your cars, you know, that
still trappings seven. And then, uh,

1393
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:57,560
one night I was hanging out with Bert
Kreischer, his shows. I did a spot and uh,

1394
01:15:57,670 --> 01:15:59,620
uh, I had a couple of drinks, you know,

1395
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,280
at the show there's going to go
to Mcdonald's and go to my hotel.

1396
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:05,550
So I go to Mcdonald's, go through the
drive through, I'm going to park my car,

1397
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:08,940
you know, to eat it. And that parking
lot was too crowded for Mcdonald's,

1398
01:16:08,941 --> 01:16:11,280
so there was like another
parking lot attached to it.

1399
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:15,150
It was like a big boy that was a, it
was close. So I just pull right through,

1400
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:17,760
you know, right out of there, the
drive through right into it, you know,

1401
01:16:17,761 --> 01:16:21,570
with my lights on, eating my mic
riddle and suddenly two cop cars,

1402
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:25,170
both sides lights on like,
and they're like off a third,

1403
01:16:25,171 --> 01:16:26,790
what are you doing in your car?
And I'm like,

1404
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:30,900
they're like shining lights on my face.
And I'm like, ah, I'm eating a McGriddle,

1405
01:16:30,901 --> 01:16:33,400
you know, like show it to
'em out the window. And uh,

1406
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,150
they came up to my car and there
goes, uh, let me see your license.

1407
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:40,230
I showed him my license and it, and it was
just like, holy shit man. Like now what?

1408
01:16:40,231 --> 01:16:43,800
They're going to make me do like a drunk
test and because I had three beers in

1409
01:16:43,801 --> 01:16:44,970
the last two hours,

1410
01:16:44,971 --> 01:16:47,730
like now I'm going to get a Dui because
I'm sitting here eating and Mick griddle.

1411
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:50,820
And then he's asking me all
these questions like, what
are you doing? I'm like,

1412
01:16:50,821 --> 01:16:55,450
I did a comedy to it and I, uh, you know,
the funny bone. And he goes, uh, uh,

1413
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:57,810
he's like, oh, how was it? And
I'm like, it was fine. He goes,

1414
01:16:57,811 --> 01:17:01,380
you've been drinking tonight.
And I go, no, that was the
first time I ever said no.

1415
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:04,320
Like I had three drinks, but I'm like,
I'm just going to say no this time.

1416
01:17:04,321 --> 01:17:07,990
Cause I had a griddle all over my face
and I was still eating when he's actually

1417
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:10,070
asking me these,
I played it off

1418
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,490
like, what the fuck are you doing
dude? Like I always like, you know,

1419
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:17,090
and so I'm rubbing Madrid all
over my face and uh, uh, he goes,

1420
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:20,600
okay, you're free to go. And I'm
like, free to go for doing what?

1421
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:23,120
I'm parking my car,
eating a McGriddle came up.

1422
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:24,590
They always make you feel
like you're in the wrong,

1423
01:17:24,591 --> 01:17:28,820
but they let you get get away this
time. You know, Ross, they're us.

1424
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:30,200
They're not the Illuminati.

1425
01:17:30,201 --> 01:17:33,740
That's what's the most fucked up thing
about you give people arbitrary power

1426
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:37,820
over other people. Exactly. That's why
he can't have laws like that folks,

1427
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:41,750
state and police have the, we give
you a nice things and you break them.

1428
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:44,780
You can't have that and it's
not good for them either.

1429
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:46,710
It's not good for you to be
in a position like that over.

1430
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:48,980
It's not good for your Karma.
At the end of the day,

1431
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:52,460
you're unhappy because I've
found this like if you're,

1432
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:56,420
if you treat other people in a shitty way,
and maybe for a short amount of time,

1433
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:57,500
you get that little ego high,

1434
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:01,540
but over time it's like you to
pay for it comes back. Exactly.

1435
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,540
Waterfall of suck and it crushes you
with the rebound and always does.

1436
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:08,120
It just is no way to live these people.
And by the way,

1437
01:18:08,121 --> 01:18:10,490
that's not the only way to get
rich to look at Ted Turner.

1438
01:18:10,491 --> 01:18:15,150
I bet that guy's got plenty of money.
Right? They actually on CNN. Yeah.

1439
01:18:15,151 --> 01:18:17,420
But he's like, no, no, no.
He's out. I think he's out.

1440
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:20,100
I think he's disgusted with maybe that's
why it's so fucked up. Yeah. Like he,

1441
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,230
he sold it to,

1442
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:26,790
I guess like a w like AOL Time Warner
became this big thing. But anyway,

1443
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,220
I shouldn't use him as an example
anyway because quite honestly,

1444
01:18:29,221 --> 01:18:31,650
I don't really know that much
about his past. He always,

1445
01:18:31,651 --> 01:18:35,040
but he always seemed like it wasn't a
bad guy, just like a smart businessman.

1446
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:37,800
It didn't seem like a Richard Branson.
He seems like an awesome guy.

1447
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:41,700
That's much better example. Thank
you. Richard Branson seems like, like,

1448
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,540
like some kind of crazy
billionaire and a movie. Like,

1449
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:47,190
I'm going to get an a
balloon and travel the globe.

1450
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:51,150
I'm going to get a space
ship going to Mars. I mean,

1451
01:18:51,151 --> 01:18:55,130
he really does seem like that guy.
So fucking super, super, super.

1452
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:58,790
Read his article about,
uh, drug policy. No,

1453
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,810
I did incredible on the Virgin did if
we're on the virgin corporate websites,

1454
01:19:02,811 --> 01:19:06,290
so he puts his corporate name
behind it, virgin.com. He, uh,

1455
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:08,480
put this letter saying,
you know,

1456
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:12,680
we should all look at the
Portugal decriminalization
project the past 10 years.

1457
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:15,740
They're doing decriminalization. It works.
Is this, about a year ago he did this,

1458
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:19,400
uh, maybe a little less than that
around then. Uh, when he did that,

1459
01:19:19,401 --> 01:19:20,121
people were like,
okay,

1460
01:19:20,121 --> 01:19:23,450
we have to actually look at this
study because he's a serious guy.

1461
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:27,010
A lot of people don't realize that
Portugal decriminalized all drugs. Uh,

1462
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,630
it was it a decade ago,
a decade ago,

1463
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:32,790
essentially made it so that
everything is legal. And what,

1464
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:35,600
what's crazy is that they're violent.
Crime has dropped,

1465
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:39,420
their rates of addiction have dropped.
Um,

1466
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:42,680
clinics have less people in them that
needed help, that are, that are addicted.

1467
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:46,610
So it's kind of amazing. It's
when you let people, you know,

1468
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:48,680
you don't try to nanny
state the fucking world.

1469
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:51,740
People have this weird thing where if
you tell them they can't do something,

1470
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:56,300
they want to do it. They, it's
weird. When something's illegal,

1471
01:19:56,390 --> 01:20:00,380
it makes it an intoxicating and makes
it exciting for people. You know,

1472
01:20:00,381 --> 01:20:01,670
it's whereas as well,

1473
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:04,050
and there were also some things that are
so good that even if they're illegal,

1474
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:08,010
you're going to try it anyway. Sure.
You know, booze, they, they tried that.

1475
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,620
They tried, uh, you know, that was,

1476
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:14,250
that's another example of legislation
where you have good intentions but nobody

1477
01:20:14,251 --> 01:20:16,080
did the math on it. Yeah. And,

1478
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:19,170
and really not even good
intentions because you can't
tell people what to ingest

1479
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:21,840
and the privacy of their own home.
I understand their point.

1480
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:24,960
I understand the point of the, the
really clean, straight edge people.

1481
01:20:24,961 --> 01:20:27,220
I have friends that are straight edge.
Totally fine.

1482
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,550
I shouldn't have to impose it on the
whole country. You're right, you're right.

1483
01:20:29,551 --> 01:20:33,840
But what they think is that it worked
for them and there's no way it could, uh,

1484
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:37,080
it could be different for you. You,
in your case, if you're drinking,

1485
01:20:37,081 --> 01:20:40,470
if you like to go out and do shots
and hang out with Bert Kreischer,

1486
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:43,410
you are having a problem, you've
got a problem. And you know,

1487
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:44,940
obviously I don't agree with that,

1488
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,650
but I see where their
intention is coming from.

1489
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:48,990
I see why they wanted to try
to do it in the first place.

1490
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:50,970
They wanted to try to clean up America,
America,

1491
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:53,340
even back then in the
1920s it's filled with sin.

1492
01:20:53,341 --> 01:20:55,740
It was the roaring twenties
everybody was fucking nuts.

1493
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:59,460
They were having these speakeasies they
get together and bang. It was craziness.

1494
01:20:59,461 --> 01:21:04,440
There were animals. It's pretty awesome
actually. Fucking fantastic. No texting,

1495
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,440
you know. All you can have to say is,
I don't know what she's talking about.

1496
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:09,990
And you were done. You were out of
it. There was no good age though.

1497
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:12,690
Were they my kid? You agreed to
meet somebody and you just met them.

1498
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,890
There is no like last minute changes
and like, and how'd you meet him again?

1499
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,800
You have to find where they live and
that's why cities are so beneficial.

1500
01:21:19,801 --> 01:21:22,020
There was no communication.
There's no phones.

1501
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:26,580
We had to find where they live or how
do people get around before the maps on

1502
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:30,660
phones? Well, I remember
living in Boston and you know,

1503
01:21:30,661 --> 01:21:33,030
meeting people and walking everywhere.

1504
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:37,620
I mean I remember when I was a kid from
high school on like we fucking walked

1505
01:21:37,621 --> 01:21:41,940
everywhere.
We would walk like miles to the t to the,

1506
01:21:41,941 --> 01:21:45,870
to the train to get into Boston.
We just walk miles.

1507
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:50,220
Kids today don't do that kind of shit.
There's no kids walking my,

1508
01:21:50,221 --> 01:21:53,040
they're texting each other. They don't
have to go and meet each other in person.

1509
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:55,230
They don't have to go and
hope they run into each other.

1510
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:59,190
We didn't even have answering machines.
You call people if they weren't home.

1511
01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:00,060
Tough Shit.

1512
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:05,760
It's been a weird thing for me as a human
being to have come of age should be a

1513
01:22:05,761 --> 01:22:07,170
teenager and with the,

1514
01:22:07,171 --> 01:22:10,200
with the invention of the answering
machine and seeing that and going, wow,

1515
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:12,570
you mean so we can fucking leave a
message and you're not even here.

1516
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:16,920
Like what a mind blower that was
for me to sing this video. Yeah.

1517
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:20,700
Of what kind of information is being
and how much they can know about every

1518
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,450
credit card transaction. I
think that's the, the other, uh,

1519
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:28,980
the other thing about, you're
saying earlier about like
where things really, uh,

1520
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:31,170
maybe things were just as bad back then,

1521
01:22:31,171 --> 01:22:32,910
but we didn't know about it because
we didn't have the Internet.

1522
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:35,910
I think part of it is they would have,
maybe they wanted this kind of thing,

1523
01:22:35,911 --> 01:22:38,100
but they just didn't have the
technology to do it to pull it off.

1524
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:41,670
It would just be it be possible to do
this thing would require like hiring

1525
01:22:41,671 --> 01:22:44,910
millions of operators and you just,
you can't do that.

1526
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:47,850
But it's an example of the
ethic that's always been there.

1527
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:52,740
It's the US versus them mentality that
is accelerating because of the fact

1528
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,290
there's so much civil
uprising around the world.

1529
01:22:55,620 --> 01:23:00,300
I mean we really are getting to this
really ridiculous point where, you know,

1530
01:23:00,301 --> 01:23:04,290
the Mayan apocalypse date
of 2012 December 21st date,

1531
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:08,560
it's completely ridiculous that these
guys had figured out when the world was

1532
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:12,520
going to fall apart. Yet. How weird is it
that the world is fucking falling apart?

1533
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:16,660
It's closing in on that day. How
many earthquakes? We had a yesterday,

1534
01:23:16,661 --> 01:23:18,280
it's hundreds of earthquakes.

1535
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:22,240
There was one area that at hundreds of
earthquakes I think we actually have,

1536
01:23:22,241 --> 01:23:25,630
like, I think the US has a really
bright future, but I think, uh,

1537
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:28,780
it's kind of all a house of cards.
Like you have to be very careful.

1538
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:33,070
You start pulling out certain cards and
undermining faith in certain things and

1539
01:23:33,071 --> 01:23:36,090
before you know it, you don't have a
society anymore. You have, you know,

1540
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:39,970
with the Mayans experienced to their
society vantage or broke down or whatever

1541
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:41,160
the hell happened to them.
Yeah.

1542
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:44,020
It's not just that these
people shouldn't be corrupt.

1543
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:48,880
It's that when you are corrupt and when
you are in a position where you are not

1544
01:23:48,881 --> 01:23:50,830
looking out for the
greater good of mankind,

1545
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:53,770
you're ruining the entire
process of acceleration.

1546
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:58,240
You're ruining it and subverting it and
making it a selfish thing and making all

1547
01:23:58,241 --> 01:24:01,300
the, all the things that don't
get corrected as we move forward.

1548
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:05,380
It's like say if you were a little kid
and you just decided you were going to

1549
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:08,800
shit in the middle of your bedroom
because you didn't feel like going to the

1550
01:24:08,801 --> 01:24:12,010
bathroom, you have your own choice.
Nobody can tell you what to do.

1551
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:14,860
So you just say you're five, you're
like, I'm just going to shit right here.

1552
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,440
You pull your pants down and shit and
then you make a little pile and your

1553
01:24:17,441 --> 01:24:19,120
bathroom and then you always
think you're going to clean up,

1554
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:20,620
but you never get around to it.
I mean,

1555
01:24:20,621 --> 01:24:23,830
that's essentially what the
human races to the world,

1556
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:28,570
which is leaving shit places and just
assuming we're eventually gonna get to

1557
01:24:28,571 --> 01:24:28,961
some point,

1558
01:24:28,961 --> 01:24:32,470
we're going to clean it up instead of
dealing with it first and foremost,

1559
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:36,310
before we start fucking around with the
governments and other parts of the world,

1560
01:24:36,311 --> 01:24:39,580
and before we start fucking around
with tap at People's phones,

1561
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:43,450
let's figure out a way how to get oil
out of the fucking ocean without killing

1562
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:44,343
everything.

1563
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:48,430
Let's figure out a way to let the dolphins
live and not have shrimp be fucking

1564
01:24:48,431 --> 01:24:49,264
poison.

1565
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:53,200
Let's figure out a way to not putting
a tire economy out of work because you

1566
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:58,201
fucking assholes wanting to finish your
drill early so you've used cheaper parts

1567
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:01,240
are less stringent. Set up. Amen.

1568
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:06,630
Get on that first and
then let's fade Iran.

1569
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:08,950
That's the other thing
that outrages me so much.

1570
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:12,370
You see a video like that and
he's, and it's not only like, okay,

1571
01:25:12,371 --> 01:25:13,420
they're violating our rights.

1572
01:25:13,421 --> 01:25:16,420
And there are creepy implications for
how this can be used at some point,

1573
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,000
but it's,
this is a colossal waste of money.

1574
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:21,910
This is billions and billions of dollars
and this is only one program that we

1575
01:25:21,911 --> 01:25:24,790
know about it. We don't know what other
creepy programs are out there right now.

1576
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:25,983
And uh,

1577
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,930
how that same amount of money could
be used on things where you see a real

1578
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:32,950
tangible impact on people's communities.
Like teachers don't get paid. Well,

1579
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:35,070
cops don't get paid well. No. Uh,

1580
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,600
and maybe if we paid people
better and have better incentives,

1581
01:25:37,601 --> 01:25:38,620
we would get better people.

1582
01:25:38,621 --> 01:25:41,800
That's how it is in every other industry
and it should be an honorable position.

1583
01:25:41,801 --> 01:25:45,400
I've always said that being a teacher
should be a position of respect and

1584
01:25:45,401 --> 01:25:46,420
honoring this country.

1585
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,730
And it should be something
that's very difficult to achieve.

1586
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:52,270
We should know that you are of of great
character, that you're a good person,

1587
01:25:52,271 --> 01:25:55,150
that you're looking at life in the right
direction, you know, a creepy pervert.

1588
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:58,360
We should know all these things about
you and when we should respect the fact

1589
01:25:58,361 --> 01:26:00,220
that you're going to be
spending time with our kids.

1590
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:03,010
And some of that spending time with
your kids has profound influence.

1591
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:04,010
They're teaching them things.

1592
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:07,290
Yeah, it's really dangerous.
You can't even put a money. Uh,

1593
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,460
you can't even put a price on the impact.
You can have either good or bad.

1594
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:12,860
I had a civics teacher in seventh grade.

1595
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:15,680
He's part of the reason why I'm
interested in politics today because, uh,

1596
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:18,920
he did this crazy experiment that I
feel like every teacher should do.

1597
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:20,300
We were in a private school at the time,

1598
01:26:20,301 --> 01:26:21,950
so you're allowed to get
away with more stuff.

1599
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:25,820
And a public school prior would
have been sued. Uh, but what he did,

1600
01:26:25,821 --> 01:26:29,630
we walked into class one
day. It just seemed like a
normal class, right? And, uh,

1601
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:34,850
we walk into class and he says,
okay, uh, if you have brown eyes,

1602
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:40,130
you have brown eyes sit in the front two
rows. If you have a, you have blue eyes,

1603
01:26:40,131 --> 01:26:44,830
I want you in the back of the room. And
he just segregated us by Eichler. And, uh,

1604
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,930
at first people were like, okay,
this is some kind of joke, you know,

1605
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:51,920
he's just messing around and you'd say
you and call on someone with Brown eyes

1606
01:26:51,921 --> 01:26:54,230
and give them preferential
treatment over the blue eyes.

1607
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,600
I think I'm actually messing this up.
I think it was the other way around.

1608
01:26:56,601 --> 01:27:01,430
Like it people who have blue
eyes doses. Yeah, exactly.

1609
01:27:01,431 --> 01:27:03,470
If you looked area and uh,
you were in the,

1610
01:27:03,471 --> 01:27:06,780
you are in the front and if you
didn't you were in the back. And uh,

1611
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:10,340
so he starts asking questions and
whenever somebody in the back was asked a

1612
01:27:10,341 --> 01:27:12,320
question answered, he
said, no, that's wrong.

1613
01:27:12,321 --> 01:27:15,350
You obviously didn't do the homework
last night. You have to read up. This is,

1614
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:18,440
even if it was a great answer and it was
starting to fuck with people mentally

1615
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,590
where these people were getting better
treatment and the people in the back

1616
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:26,070
based entirely on Eichler. By the end of
that class there were girls crying and,

1617
01:27:26,071 --> 01:27:30,650
and guys too, like people were crying
and like, what's up? And they were like,

1618
01:27:30,651 --> 01:27:33,470
is this real? Like what's wrong
with this guy? Why is it doing this?

1619
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:37,030
It's my answer was good and then at the
end then at the end he told us he was

1620
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:41,090
just running an exercise to show us what
it's like when you have inequality and

1621
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:44,330
for somebody using a suburban white
kid, you're like, that must suck.

1622
01:27:44,331 --> 01:27:47,600
To feel that all the time. You
know, it's a deep experiment.

1623
01:27:47,601 --> 01:27:50,090
I think every teacher should do that,
and that wasn't the only thing he did,

1624
01:27:50,091 --> 01:27:53,420
but the point is he had a profound
impact and he probably made a very small

1625
01:27:53,421 --> 01:27:56,270
amount of money for doing it.
That's a beautiful idea, man.

1626
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:59,120
That's a beautiful way of pointing it out.
Show it,

1627
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:01,970
show it to people and let them know
that it was just an act, but show,

1628
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:04,640
show them what is possible.
You know, there's, look,

1629
01:28:04,641 --> 01:28:07,520
there's a lot of racism in this country
that's undeniable and it's one of the

1630
01:28:07,521 --> 01:28:12,050
grossest things about human beings, but
classism, all that shit is just as bad.

1631
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:13,093
Any,
any,

1632
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:16,940
any distinction where you automatically
put someone in a desert where you'll put

1633
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:18,320
your prejudging marginalized.

1634
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:20,810
I've met some rich people who suck and
I met some really rich people who are

1635
01:28:20,811 --> 01:28:23,930
just amazing. Absolutely you don't. You
don't judge somebody by their income.

1636
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:27,410
I've always been offended that people
think you're an idiot because you exercise

1637
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,790
and perhaps someone who fucking stupid
conversations with people that are like,

1638
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,030
Oh, good work in your
body. Meet Hood. I'm like,

1639
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:38,000
go stay in shape and why is that
marginalize me because I'm in shape half

1640
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:42,950
everybody that lifts weights has to be
a more on really is that convenient for

1641
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:45,830
you? You don't have to compete.
Certainly not good for evolution.

1642
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:46,940
It's so ridiculous.

1643
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:51,440
People are just slowly trying
to stop what is inevitable.

1644
01:28:51,441 --> 01:28:54,980
They're clawing at what is
inevitable and what's inevitable.

1645
01:28:54,981 --> 01:28:58,310
It's ultimate accountability for
everything, all of your actions,

1646
01:28:58,311 --> 01:29:02,010
and then it's eventually going to
move from that to being your very

1647
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:02,551
thoughts.

1648
01:29:02,551 --> 01:29:07,230
There's going to be the next phase of
technology unquestionably is going to be

1649
01:29:07,231 --> 01:29:10,890
some sort of fucking interface where
people are going to be able to read each

1650
01:29:10,891 --> 01:29:14,910
other's minds or communicate without any
sort of noise coming out of your mouth.

1651
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,790
I think that is 100% common.

1652
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:21,540
I think we're going to be able to
communicate things in visual form as well.

1653
01:29:21,541 --> 01:29:23,760
I think you're gonna be able to
communicate memories eventually.

1654
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:28,000
You're going to be able to lock heads
with someone and show them your day and I

1655
01:29:28,001 --> 01:29:28,880
don't think that's out.

1656
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,970
And I think your memory is going to be
more phenomenal than the current fucking

1657
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:37,680
weird slide show that you have now. Blurry
images that you barely can remember.

1658
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:41,130
It just what I did today.
If you asked me how I what?

1659
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:45,000
What exactly happened from the moment
you woke up? Can you remember every no,

1660
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:48,720
no I don't. I remember playing with
my kids. I remember getting in my car,

1661
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:52,680
this is blocks, little little
flashes, a little slideshow.

1662
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:56,760
You'll be able to pull all of that shit.
You'll be able to pull every second

1663
01:29:57,340 --> 01:30:00,110
software. It's going to make it
probably Google goggles, bitch. No, no,

1664
01:30:00,130 --> 01:30:02,320
that software. We just watched
that video on the New York Times.

1665
01:30:02,321 --> 01:30:04,210
It's probably going to be like,
you want to see my day?

1666
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:08,350
Here's an exact DVR of my day, but I
edited out like two hours of poop of me.

1667
01:30:08,351 --> 01:30:10,780
Boop beating off on the
toilet with two Q tips.

1668
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:19,560
That's the ultimate sin beating off on
the toilet while you're have a qtip in

1669
01:30:19,961 --> 01:30:23,920
your air and shit. So bad for you man.
Taking a shit rubbish. Q-Tips. Yeah,

1670
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:27,250
they're terrible for you man. You need
to just get it done. Once I had loved my,

1671
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:30,000
no, no, no, I do. I just, I
need to wait. Qtip it's bad.

1672
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:32,110
Some times you shouldn't
be digging in your ears.

1673
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:34,270
What are you supposed to do that
and cause your wax builds up.

1674
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,950
He's supposed to get it cleaned,
cleaned out or they have like,

1675
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:40,330
like ear juice that you can buy it.
It's like cvs,

1676
01:30:40,331 --> 01:30:42,070
he put it in there has like
this little plunger thing,

1677
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:44,250
but you're the worst thing
you're not supposed to do.

1678
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:47,770
That's where nowhere on the box for a
box of Q tips is it say put this shit in

1679
01:30:47,771 --> 01:30:50,860
your ear. Right? It's crazy.
So good though. It does.

1680
01:30:50,861 --> 01:30:53,230
Especially when you're taking a
shit and beating off. I told you,

1681
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:56,650
I told you this Joe with my, I don't
know if I told her on podcasts of my,

1682
01:30:57,150 --> 01:31:01,840
this is my ex, she was cleaning
her ear out and then uh, she,

1683
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:06,300
the phone rang so she picked it up and
she shoved the qtip inner ears start

1684
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:09,470
gushing blood and pocket your drunk. Yeah.
You did talk about this on the podcast.

1685
01:31:09,471 --> 01:31:14,000
So watch this power, find ways
to die. The one where the uh,

1686
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:15,940
she's getting a massage or no,

1687
01:31:15,941 --> 01:31:19,750
she's getting acupuncture and like rolls
off the bed and like one goes right

1688
01:31:19,751 --> 01:31:22,450
through her heart is how real.
I mean it has to be real.

1689
01:31:22,451 --> 01:31:25,120
It's a thousand ways to die.
What are they doing?

1690
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:28,480
Shish Kebab needles on this bitch.
That doesn't even make sense.

1691
01:31:28,481 --> 01:31:31,060
How the fucking you get killed by
an acupuncturist scene of a pussy.

1692
01:31:31,061 --> 01:31:33,640
Are you that an acupuncture
needle is killing you?

1693
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:35,020
Just went right through a heart.
I guess.

1694
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:36,950
I almost think that shows
like creep show though.

1695
01:31:36,951 --> 01:31:41,790
Like I almost think that
it's like written. Um,

1696
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:47,230
but I think, I think they
have to be factual Brazil
thing. It's based on I think.

1697
01:31:47,231 --> 01:31:48,300
I think it's supposed to
be here. I like, I like,

1698
01:31:48,301 --> 01:31:51,460
I almost think that's one of those shows
that they write stories like that. Yeah,

1699
01:31:51,461 --> 01:31:55,360
you could die.
Why wouldn't they have that as an option?

1700
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:58,960
I mean they'd be crazy if the producers
didn't have that as an option. Yeah,

1701
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,120
maybe you're right. Yeah. The act

1702
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,920
of bumps or one doesn't make any
sense to me. That sounds crazy.

1703
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:06,190
If it's on true TV, it has to be fake.
It's fucking completely ridiculous.

1704
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:09,050
I don't think the acupuncture needles
could kill you like that cause it went

1705
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:12,190
right through our heart so it
could have just, how's it going?

1706
01:32:12,191 --> 01:32:14,830
Right through your heart.
It's going to penetrate all that meat.

1707
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:16,450
It's going to go through your bone.

1708
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:19,330
What's it going to do is you got
to find the perfect, yeah. Really.

1709
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:22,390
Maybe she had to bat Boone
hard. Maybe it's being, maybe.

1710
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:26,890
Maybe if it fucking you landed on it
perfectly and it didn't bend maybe,

1711
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:30,730
but really I wouldn't think that thing
would kill you. I wouldn't be too little.

1712
01:32:30,731 --> 01:32:33,420
Can I take an Alpha brand and
see if the next like ours.

1713
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:37,510
I'm just curious like if I become really
smart all of a sudden go for dose. Well,

1714
01:32:37,511 --> 01:32:39,850
you're already super smart dude.
And you already saw articulate.

1715
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:41,920
You're barely going to notice
here to smarter. Ready.

1716
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:46,210
What this is for is mid level retards
like myself that can barely form sentences

1717
01:32:46,211 --> 01:32:48,520
without it. Oh actually
take, did you just chew it?

1718
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:52,290
Oh, I was like, you're a fucking savage.

1719
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:57,440
Imagine he just started snorting
it. Is this your Alpha brain? Yeah.

1720
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,220
David Seaman running for Congress.

1721
01:32:59,221 --> 01:33:01,950
I caught starting drugs and the
Joe Rogan experience podcast.

1722
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,670
They know it's a new tropic. It
doesn't count. Are you trying to,

1723
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:10,590
is this a pee Dee for politics?
Should it be allowed next on Nightline?

1724
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,370
Shit.
Nootropics be allowed.

1725
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,180
Should we allow people to be smarter than
others when they could use it against

1726
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:22,840
you? They'll have some like youtube video
of this 16 year old like artist took a

1727
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:23,733
nootropic and like

1728
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:25,710
I'm going to folks a butcher

1729
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:30,200
then it was Salvia. They
totally villainize Salvia,
right? Cause they're like,

1730
01:33:30,201 --> 01:33:31,940
we found a couple of dudes on youtube,

1731
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:34,550
millions of people have tried it
and it's legal in a lot of states.

1732
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:38,450
We found some dudes on Youtube who acted
like assholes when after they took it.

1733
01:33:38,451 --> 01:33:41,690
Brian's one of them.
So clearly that's scientific.

1734
01:33:41,691 --> 01:33:43,850
Clearly based on what a couple
of people post on youtube,

1735
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:47,390
we have to make this illegal and we
have to do a witch hunt against it.

1736
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:51,050
It's fascinating that it was legal for
so long and such a potent psychedelic,

1737
01:33:51,051 --> 01:33:54,530
and it's, it's, I think it's very
indicative of the times we live in. It's,

1738
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:57,530
people slowly figured that out
and started to sell it, you know,

1739
01:33:57,531 --> 01:34:01,080
because what you mean, that wasn't
around, what is it exactly? It's,

1740
01:34:01,081 --> 01:34:04,130
it's sage is what it is.
The word, the plants.

1741
01:34:04,131 --> 01:34:08,060
Sage is this sub Salvia divinorum target.

1742
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:13,540
So it's just like, it's like I want
to target the plant form of it. Um,

1743
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:16,580
well they also sell San Pedro cactuses.
You could buy those anywhere.

1744
01:34:16,581 --> 01:34:18,470
They're not illegal.
And that's the source of masculine.

1745
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:23,390
That's the really the Carlos Castaneda
stuff. Well, Terrence, we can, uh,

1746
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:28,160
famously, uh, on the big island of
Hawaii had a tropical rain forest garden.

1747
01:34:28,161 --> 01:34:32,120
He lived on, uh, the rain forest side
where it was beautiful up there. Man,

1748
01:34:32,121 --> 01:34:33,980
there's pictures of his
home was incredible.

1749
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:38,330
He had this really cool pad he put up
there on the island and he had every

1750
01:34:38,331 --> 01:34:43,100
psychedelic plant known demand because
most of them grow breasts in these, uh,

1751
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:47,360
these sort of a rain forest
environment. So breast, yes.

1752
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:50,920
So you had it set up there. We had
Salvia, he had San Pedro cactus.

1753
01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:54,790
They're all legal. The, the, the, the
plant, what it, whatever it is, the uh,

1754
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:59,270
Chicago Tree Veritas that they get
Iowasca from all these different plants.

1755
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:00,050
He had them all growing.

1756
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:03,740
They're all totally legal and beautiful
and fascinating to know that all of

1757
01:35:03,741 --> 01:35:05,120
these different plants,
I mean,

1758
01:35:05,121 --> 01:35:07,670
even if you just had them as
your little plant buddies,

1759
01:35:07,671 --> 01:35:09,590
you never even smoked him,
just kept them in your yard.

1760
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,740
There's something kind of dope knowing
that you could literally change your

1761
01:35:12,741 --> 01:35:15,050
consciousness or some shit that's
growing next to your house,

1762
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:17,660
knowing that has that kind of power.
Incredible power.

1763
01:35:17,661 --> 01:35:22,160
And Salvia is way more potent than
a lot of shit that is illegal. It's,

1764
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:26,580
it's way more posed. Salvia is
really fucking strong. If you,

1765
01:35:26,581 --> 01:35:29,090
you get a real good dose of Salvia.
It is,

1766
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:32,780
it removes you from Earth
for a short period of time.

1767
01:35:32,781 --> 01:35:36,260
It puts you in this really intense
hallucinogenic state. Can I,

1768
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:38,180
can I admit that I've done Salvia?
I don't think that hurts me.

1769
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:41,610
I don't think it hurts. Ya know, I did
an estate where it was legal and yeah,

1770
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:43,280
so short acting,

1771
01:35:43,281 --> 01:35:47,150
it's like five minutes and I collapsed
and I felt I was actually a sheet of

1772
01:35:47,151 --> 01:35:50,250
paper, like a cosmic sheet of
paper. Yeah. It's weird stuff.

1773
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:53,900
It's like a whippet of mushrooms.
It's like doing like a, it's so fast.

1774
01:35:53,901 --> 01:35:57,080
I couldn't find five minutes
later I was back to myself.

1775
01:35:57,650 --> 01:36:00,260
And it's not like you're stuck
there for hours, you know?

1776
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:02,540
I only did it once and it didn't,
I don't think I did it right,

1777
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:07,780
but I did it enough that it was really
creepy. Like on a podcast show. Yeah.

1778
01:36:07,890 --> 01:36:08,511
I don't think that's a good,

1779
01:36:08,511 --> 01:36:11,090
that's not something you would ever get
addicted to cause I was like, all right,

1780
01:36:11,091 --> 01:36:11,924
cool.
Did that,

1781
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:17,050
like it took me over my own head and I
was looking down at myself and like these

1782
01:36:17,331 --> 01:36:19,430
pulsating waves,
uh,

1783
01:36:19,431 --> 01:36:23,810
to get like a new burst and new image
of me looking from like over here,

1784
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:28,130
like up and to my right looking
down at me and I'm like, Ooh,

1785
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:32,240
we like the Indian gods with all the
different hands. No, it was just me.

1786
01:36:32,241 --> 01:36:34,370
It was just me. I don't think
I had enough, like I said,

1787
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:35,270
and it didn't last that long.

1788
01:36:35,271 --> 01:36:38,360
It was just a few minutes of an
out of body experience. But I was,

1789
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,270
I remember thinking like,
how am I even seeing this perspective?

1790
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:45,400
How am I seeing myself from here? Like
this is weird. How am I seeing it?

1791
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:50,300
Or Am I getting a hallucination of the
idea that I'm saying? And he didn't know.

1792
01:36:50,350 --> 01:36:54,620
How crazy is it that you can just
walk into a store and buy it legally?

1793
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:57,920
But my experience, I was still me. I
was still there. I didn't, you know,

1794
01:36:57,921 --> 01:36:58,850
I didn't leave the couch.

1795
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:04,010
I've had people that have taken a lot
of it describe like really bizarre Ari

1796
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:09,010
Shaffir talks about how he lived a whole
like several month period of his life

1797
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:14,090
during a a 10 minute Salvia trip
while took it and then had all these

1798
01:37:14,091 --> 01:37:16,700
relationships and
friendships and had all this,

1799
01:37:16,701 --> 01:37:18,620
this whole different life like inception,

1800
01:37:18,621 --> 01:37:22,820
like the different layers where
the time gets messed up. Exactly.

1801
01:37:22,821 --> 01:37:26,600
And he said when he came back from
this 10 minute, you know, trip,

1802
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:30,980
the Salvia trip, he had remembered
everything but it was just like,

1803
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:35,650
he was just like coming out of a month
of a, you know, visiting your friends.

1804
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:37,960
It's a month of like all of a sudden
you're here. How'd I get here?

1805
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,610
That's so weird.
I really want to hear him talk that,

1806
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,460
talk about that because that does
not sound like a Salvia trip at all.

1807
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:47,480
I know it doesn't, but I don't
think they're all uniform.
I, I've heard so many,

1808
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:50,240
like I said, mine was so simple. I didn't,

1809
01:37:50,241 --> 01:37:53,210
I definitely didn't have enough cause
it was just me. It was me above me.

1810
01:37:53,211 --> 01:37:56,250
It was weird images of me looking
down on me. It was nothing.

1811
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:58,680
I didn't learn shit from it
other than like, this is weird,

1812
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:02,910
but everybody that I know that's had
like big ones I've taken like big,

1813
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:05,580
big experiences.
I know I didn't get a big enough hit,

1814
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:09,570
but I could imagine if it could do that
with like the little baby hit that I had

1815
01:38:09,571 --> 01:38:10,710
where I wasn't even doing it.
Right.

1816
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:14,100
Apparently you need like one of those
blow torch library collider. Yeah.

1817
01:38:14,101 --> 01:38:16,080
You need a blow torch lighter.
I had like a big,

1818
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:19,080
and it just wasn't hot enough so it just
kind of tripped me out a little bit.

1819
01:38:19,081 --> 01:38:22,230
But apparently the blow torch light or
puts you into another fucking dimension.

1820
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:22,410
Yeah,

1821
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:25,650
it has to cook it to a certain temperature
in order to work stronger than weed.

1822
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:29,940
That's way stronger than we can just
bond that you can just walk into a gift

1823
01:38:29,941 --> 01:38:32,820
shop and buy it. It's
so stupid. We need to,

1824
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:35,070
and it's like that's actually
dangerous. Like, yeah.

1825
01:38:35,170 --> 01:38:39,090
And the sense that you could be an idiot
who walks in the gift shop buys or $15.

1826
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:41,700
You pop it right there. You're,
you smoke it right there.

1827
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:44,940
Although you can actually, I think
get it as a tea or something. You can,

1828
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:49,730
I think so. Oh my God. Uh, so I,
I didn't do it as a tea though. I,

1829
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:51,360
I smoked it,
but uh,

1830
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:56,810
that the shit out of me is that the idea
that you can not like the idea that you

1831
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:59,070
can get that legally and I
just walk out in the street,

1832
01:38:59,071 --> 01:39:02,340
you'll be just run over by a car.
Cars are going to be so out of it versus,

1833
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:06,630
I mean, especially the t because who knows
how your body is going to process it.

1834
01:39:06,631 --> 01:39:09,060
What else was going to process it
differently because it's going through the

1835
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:12,180
liver and the digestive system as
opposed to just going right into the

1836
01:39:12,181 --> 01:39:13,140
bloodstream with a smoke.

1837
01:39:13,330 --> 01:39:17,260
Now this isn't, yeah, this
isn't, if somebody sent, this
is a video of you doing it,

1838
01:39:19,670 --> 01:39:21,950
it's actually a campaign videos.

1839
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:26,330
This is David Seaman Rolling.
Salvia

1840
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:32,030
real conservative with his hippie
girlfriend. Well, I bet her feet steak.

1841
01:39:32,031 --> 01:39:32,864
Why do you want to guess?

1842
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:36,140
I would not doubt
that

1843
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:41,810
you ever see this tour? Yeah. Oh
yeah. I seen the shit. That's crazy.

1844
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:44,240
When I broke the window,

1845
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:54,230
it's crazy. It's almost no real
dude. He was almost like a Zombie,

1846
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:58,950
like it's not real. I know. Almost like a
Zombie. It's fake. It's fake. That's fake.

1847
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:01,090
Going to say that it's an
anti Salvia as it, yeah. Okay.

1848
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:03,980
That seems a little over the top because
I remember the ones that people just

1849
01:40:03,981 --> 01:40:05,850
laughing and like screaming and stuff.

1850
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:08,800
That's why I actually made a Salvia video.
Not because,

1851
01:40:08,830 --> 01:40:12,280
I mean I was like this is right
before everyone started doing it,

1852
01:40:12,281 --> 01:40:14,970
but like there was a few people doing
this cool before. It was cool now,

1853
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:18,640
but there was few people that did salvia
videos and it was the funniest videos

1854
01:40:18,641 --> 01:40:21,190
to watch. Like I was
laughing, like I was addicted.

1855
01:40:21,191 --> 01:40:25,270
It was like dubstep from five years ago
and then I just wanted to try it and

1856
01:40:25,271 --> 01:40:29,200
then I wanted to make a
video of it because it was
fun watching yourself do it.

1857
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:32,710
But now I feel like an asshole for doing
it because now every week kids doing it.

1858
01:40:32,711 --> 01:40:37,210
And why do you feel like
an asshole? Because I don't
think that should be legal.

1859
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,720
Why not?
Because I think like like that,

1860
01:40:39,721 --> 01:40:43,330
that fun video that we just watched that
could happen or somebody could do it

1861
01:40:43,331 --> 01:40:45,010
while driving or or something like that.

1862
01:40:45,070 --> 01:40:47,860
I can't protect the
world from idiots Brian,

1863
01:40:47,861 --> 01:40:50,230
because then it keeps stuff
from you and I. Right.

1864
01:40:50,231 --> 01:40:53,680
But at least think it should have some
kind of 21 year old rating least or

1865
01:40:53,681 --> 01:40:54,580
something.
Some

1866
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:55,540
maybe.
You know what I mean?

1867
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,150
But I don't think it's rental
supervision after 18 years of age,

1868
01:40:58,151 --> 01:41:02,500
something like that. Yeah. To me
that just seems too dangerous.

1869
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:04,480
Just because I,
I didn't,

1870
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:07,810
I didn't know where I was for
seven minutes at the very least.

1871
01:41:07,811 --> 01:41:10,530
Like there should be an info packet
on the back. Like the same way as you,

1872
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:14,290
you take a stupid drug for like allergies,
there's a packet.

1873
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:17,710
It's like five pages long and telling you
all the possible reactions and what to

1874
01:41:17,711 --> 01:41:19,900
do. Right. Why don't to
have the same thing for that

1875
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:21,770
and listen, this is nothing. It's not,

1876
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:25,350
this is not like saying that it's a good
idea for everybody to do these things

1877
01:41:25,450 --> 01:41:26,520
because it's not,

1878
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:29,940
I know a lot of people that can barely
handle regular reality and they should

1879
01:41:29,941 --> 01:41:32,220
not be fucking with Salvia or anything.

1880
01:41:32,221 --> 01:41:34,670
So to say that everything
should be illegal,

1881
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:37,950
people should also have
people looking out for them.

1882
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:42,090
People should also have people that they
can turn to to be educated on your own

1883
01:41:42,091 --> 01:41:45,000
choices. But I know people
that take mushrooms for a goof,

1884
01:41:45,001 --> 01:41:47,880
they just take it for fun. And guess
what? There's nothing wrong with that.

1885
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:51,210
But I think we should have,
if we're going to,

1886
01:41:51,690 --> 01:41:54,600
if we're going to be an
honest society about,

1887
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,300
about substances and
their effect on people,

1888
01:41:57,301 --> 01:42:00,990
we've gotta be honest about the positive
stuff too. You've got to be honest,

1889
01:42:00,991 --> 01:42:03,780
not just in people jumping out a window,
which is possible,

1890
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:06,870
but you've got to also be honest about
people who go on mushroom chips and

1891
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:08,280
become much better people.
Right?

1892
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:12,510
And that's like a real
legitimate phenomenon that's
been documented in the John

1893
01:42:12,510 --> 01:42:15,660
Hopkins study that people have changed
their personality for the better because

1894
01:42:15,661 --> 01:42:19,320
at one intense mushroom trip that they
had where they experienced profound love

1895
01:42:19,321 --> 01:42:22,950
and connectivity and all
things that people like me
and my friends that have had

1896
01:42:22,951 --> 01:42:26,190
psychedelic experiences is all relayed.
Everybody realized the same thing.

1897
01:42:26,191 --> 01:42:27,240
It changes who you are,

1898
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:30,990
changes the fundamental direction
in which your life is going.

1899
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,600
And if we as a culture don't recognize it,

1900
01:42:33,601 --> 01:42:36,240
that is a potential
tool to help all of us,

1901
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,480
including the people that are
in extreme positions of power.

1902
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:44,360
They would have a better life if they
embrace this shit as well. And it's, it's,

1903
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:45,300
well,
you can rule on,

1904
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:48,300
on a deeper level if, yeah, if
you had an experience like that,

1905
01:42:48,301 --> 01:42:49,430
you can be more like a Marcus.

1906
01:42:49,431 --> 01:42:52,980
It really is like enlightened despot
instead of just the desperate, you know?

1907
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:53,990
Absolutely.
Uh,

1908
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:58,150
and really be looking out for the totally
looking after the interests of the

1909
01:42:58,151 --> 01:43:02,140
people. And there's reward in that. You
only need a certain amount of money.

1910
01:43:02,141 --> 01:43:03,940
You corrupt countries,
you don't get it.

1911
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:08,410
You're caught up in a wave of addiction
and that addiction is to numbers because

1912
01:43:08,411 --> 01:43:11,890
after a certain while money doesn't
mean anything. You forget it.

1913
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:13,600
It is nice to have a nice car.

1914
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:16,660
It is really nice to live in a place where
you can come home and you have a nice

1915
01:43:16,661 --> 01:43:20,410
couch to sit in and a nice TV to watch
and a nice kitchen to cook your food and

1916
01:43:20,411 --> 01:43:24,400
a nice bed to sleep in. But after
that, everything else is horseshit.

1917
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:27,970
Everything else you forget every be it's,
it's everything else is like,

1918
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:30,150
what do you want a bigger watch.
One

1919
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,250
look at more expensive. Should the
houses, the CEO of Goldman Sachs,

1920
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:38,710
I wouldn't even want a house that
big people. It just seems creepy.

1921
01:43:38,711 --> 01:43:40,210
You need all that space to yourself.

1922
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:45,240
They have these giant estates
that are 30,000 square feet.

1923
01:43:46,690 --> 01:43:49,810
I'd be, I'd be embarrassed.
I'd be embarrassed to bring
somebody back to that.

1924
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,980
Yeah,
this is my house because they'd be like,

1925
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,860
that's mentally ill. Like why do you need
this much space? You're like a hoarder,

1926
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:55,694
but for houses,

1927
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:02,200
30,000 square feet behind wanting to
how such a big house to represent you.

1928
01:44:03,621 --> 01:44:06,650
It's like Evander Holyfield when
he was the heavyweight champion,

1929
01:44:06,651 --> 01:44:11,000
built this enormous mansion in Atlanta
and he couldn't keep it up. He wound up,

1930
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:13,730
I don't know if you want to be losing
it or what, but I remember he was,

1931
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:18,760
he was in severe financial straits because
it was over $1 million a year just to

1932
01:44:19,251 --> 01:44:23,330
run this place just to run it.
$1 million a year.

1933
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:25,280
Yes.

1934
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,000
Keep your fucking lights on.
Did she?

1935
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:30,490
The the the electricity
working and it's craziness.

1936
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:34,360
People that are in that sort of a job,

1937
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:37,120
if you're in the job of being like
Goldman Sachs sort of a guy and you have a

1938
01:44:37,121 --> 01:44:39,730
house like that,
it should be evidence of a sickness.

1939
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,420
Someone should come along and go, wait,
why do you have Picasso's in your house?

1940
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,820
Right? Why do you have on this shit?
What are you doing with all this shit?

1941
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:49,390
You just, you're obsessed with
acquiring more and bigger shit.

1942
01:44:49,391 --> 01:44:50,880
You want a bigger private jet,
you want it.

1943
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:54,700
And that would be fine if it wasn't for
you being in the position that you're in.

1944
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:59,080
You being in a position where you get
to manipulate the fuck and market and

1945
01:44:59,081 --> 01:45:04,081
literally changed the economy with your
corruption and then get rewarded with a

1946
01:45:04,571 --> 01:45:06,100
taxpayer bailout.

1947
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:10,630
Like we've never lived in
more transparent times of,

1948
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:13,870
of the people at the top
of the heap being sick.

1949
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:18,340
The people at the top of the heap all
need to get into a fucking sweat lodge

1950
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,120
with some native Indians high. Yeah.
And they pass around the Mescalin.

1951
01:45:22,330 --> 01:45:24,020
Well, it's also like, uh,

1952
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:28,180
the role of that person has changed now
he's isolated in his huge 30,000 square

1953
01:45:28,181 --> 01:45:32,070
foot mansion. I'm away from normal people.
I think just the generation ago. I mean,

1954
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:35,140
I'm only basing this on some
stuff I've read and mad men,

1955
01:45:35,141 --> 01:45:38,370
which is not accurate at all. But I mean,

1956
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:40,990
just basing it on what I've heard from
my parents and what I've read about.

1957
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:43,340
If you're the CEO of a company,
uh,

1958
01:45:43,341 --> 01:45:45,790
you also felt like you had some
kind of role within the community.

1959
01:45:45,791 --> 01:45:48,670
You didn't want to be known
as a scumbag or like, Hey, uh,

1960
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:49,930
whoever the Enron guy was,

1961
01:45:49,931 --> 01:45:53,140
that wasn't the end goal was
to con thousands of people
out of their retirements.

1962
01:45:53,141 --> 01:45:56,680
You're supposed to be this kind of
innovator that people respected and yeah,

1963
01:45:56,681 --> 01:45:57,430
you made more money,

1964
01:45:57,430 --> 01:46:00,190
Iacocca sorta exactly like you were
making more money then because you're

1965
01:46:00,191 --> 01:46:03,850
actually doing more and making it happen.
But at the end of the day,

1966
01:46:03,851 --> 01:46:07,540
you didn't want to just conned everybody
then live hundreds of miles away from

1967
01:46:07,541 --> 01:46:12,350
them. You know, you wanted to be a part
of the society. Cons. Yeah. Yeah. There's,

1968
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:15,640
there's no reason for them to be making
that kind of money doing what they're

1969
01:46:15,641 --> 01:46:19,150
doing anyway. It doesn't make any sense.
You're not providing anything real.

1970
01:46:19,390 --> 01:46:22,100
You're moving numbers around
you crazy assholes. Why?

1971
01:46:22,101 --> 01:46:23,770
Why are so many of them going to you?

1972
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,250
Can I play devil's
advocate on that one too?

1973
01:46:25,290 --> 01:46:28,150
Cause I have some friends who work in
finance. And although I agree with you,

1974
01:46:28,151 --> 01:46:31,360
that's, it seems like it's not
the best use of our resources,

1975
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:34,360
especially when you have the absolute
smartest people out of college getting

1976
01:46:34,361 --> 01:46:38,110
recruited these firms instead of going
to NASA or going into medicine or any of

1977
01:46:38,111 --> 01:46:39,620
these other fields. Money. Yeah. Yeah.

1978
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:43,630
But to play devil's advocate
a few hundred years ago, uh,

1979
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:45,940
we explored the whole
world and did a lot of,

1980
01:46:46,570 --> 01:46:50,490
a lot of crazy stuff over spices and
spices to take it for granted. You know,

1981
01:46:50,491 --> 01:46:52,890
you walk over to target
and buy some spices,

1982
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,890
but back then they would conquer people.
They would build ships,

1983
01:46:55,891 --> 01:46:59,070
they would chart out the whole globe
with these sophisticated maps stuff that

1984
01:46:59,071 --> 01:47:03,480
had never been done before.
All about bringing spices
back. And maybe today like,

1985
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:03,901
yeah,

1986
01:47:03,901 --> 01:47:07,140
it's bullshit that these guys on computers
are fighting each other for imaginary

1987
01:47:07,141 --> 01:47:08,970
money.
But maybe at the end of the day,

1988
01:47:08,971 --> 01:47:13,500
it's also improving our technology in
ways that we haven't anticipated. Uh,

1989
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:18,480
like I read an article about that, that,
uh, trading now is so, so high frequency.

1990
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:23,840
If they have companies that build private
radio networks just to get the trade

1991
01:47:24,031 --> 01:47:28,290
out there like a 10th of a second faster.
Wow. The whole companies, like there's a,

1992
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:30,060
there's a stock exchange in Chicago,

1993
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:33,600
the Mercantile Exchange and it has to
communicate with the New York Stock

1994
01:47:33,601 --> 01:47:35,070
Exchange and a,

1995
01:47:35,110 --> 01:47:38,340
there are private companies that will
feed that data back and forth over a

1996
01:47:38,341 --> 01:47:41,250
private microwave network.
It's a series of relays,

1997
01:47:41,490 --> 01:47:44,220
the direct line of microwave or whatever.

1998
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:48,060
And the benefit it provides them as
literally it's in the milliseconds.

1999
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:50,490
But that difference when
you're dealing with, you know,

2000
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,380
thousands of trades and
billions of dollars,

2001
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,290
it ends up being profitable to
do that stuff. That's amazing.

2002
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:57,070
Yeah. And I, I definitely
could see that point,

2003
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:01,150
but my point is that we should never
have a society that's based on the

2004
01:48:01,151 --> 01:48:05,620
confidence in different options
and stocks and companies.

2005
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:09,970
It's based on confidence and it flows
and wait, all that shit is scary.

2006
01:48:09,971 --> 01:48:12,490
All the derivatives fine,
all that shit is terrifying.

2007
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:15,450
I W I read a Matt Taibbi article on the,
the uh,

2008
01:48:15,470 --> 01:48:20,470
the actual derivative economy being
something like 10 times larger than the,

2009
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:24,640
the, you know, the speculative economy is
10 times larger than the actual account.

2010
01:48:24,710 --> 01:48:27,310
When we get enough bad bets,
everything goes down.

2011
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:30,540
It's nuts.
It's crazy and it's not necessary.

2012
01:48:30,610 --> 01:48:34,860
It is a symptom of a corrupt time and
we need to abandon it. It's nonsense.

2013
01:48:34,861 --> 01:48:38,580
This whole Federal Reserve thing is nuts.
All that shit is nuts.

2014
01:48:38,730 --> 01:48:43,380
We need to figure out some in some way
where we can trade resources in a fair

2015
01:48:43,381 --> 01:48:44,070
way.

2016
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:46,650
We need to figure that out and we're
not going to figure that out while these

2017
01:48:46,651 --> 01:48:50,760
monsters have a death grip on the economy
because that's what we're running into.

2018
01:48:50,761 --> 01:48:55,290
These big banks are a hundred times
more oppressive than the big government.

2019
01:48:55,291 --> 01:48:58,760
And then we see what the big governments
doing. Well, the big banks, they just,

2020
01:48:58,761 --> 01:49:01,980
it just clawing and suck
in and biting your neck.

2021
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:06,090
They just trying to suck all the
blood out of you. They can, you know,

2022
01:49:06,091 --> 01:49:09,000
and they're terrified if
any sort of rebellion.

2023
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:12,540
That's why Bank of America
retracted their $5 ATM fee.

2024
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:13,513
Oh,
that was,

2025
01:49:14,030 --> 01:49:18,350
I wrote some articles about that stuff
and that was interesting because that got

2026
01:49:18,351 --> 01:49:22,460
people mobilize pissed and then it's like,
what about the,

2027
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:25,610
you know,
$700 if you're working couple,

2028
01:49:25,611 --> 01:49:28,970
it's something like $700 a month of the
money you pay in taxes is going to like

2029
01:49:28,971 --> 01:49:31,280
war effort and all that stuff.
It's like,

2030
01:49:31,281 --> 01:49:33,350
why aren't you protesting
about these things? Is it,

2031
01:49:33,351 --> 01:49:36,080
is it something where like if it doesn't
immediately affect your purchase at

2032
01:49:36,081 --> 01:49:38,540
Starbucks,
you're not willing to talk about it.

2033
01:49:38,541 --> 01:49:40,970
But like if you can see it so
tangibly that you're like, fuck,

2034
01:49:40,971 --> 01:49:44,480
there's $5 less than my account,
then you go out and you're like, no,

2035
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:47,320
we're switching to a credit union.
But the other stuff doesn't you,

2036
01:49:47,321 --> 01:49:48,154
you know it's pretty Primerica.

2037
01:49:48,530 --> 01:49:52,670
Just go
picks it takes her.

2038
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:57,370
I was only kidding. Totally joking. Don't
meet it. That was, that was creepy though.

2039
01:49:57,371 --> 01:49:59,650
Like they were, they were, they
held firm for a little while.

2040
01:49:59,651 --> 01:50:03,400
Then this is our policy. If you want to
leave, that's fine. This is their policy.

2041
01:50:03,401 --> 01:50:05,140
And they realize like
this is a serious issue.

2042
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:07,780
And around the same time
this is under reported,

2043
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:12,160
their website was inaccessible for
almost a whole week. Whoa. And a,

2044
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:13,900
is that a d d o s a?
No,

2045
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,840
they never said it was a denial of
service and nobody ever took her up

2046
01:50:16,841 --> 01:50:19,720
responsibility for it. You would think
of somebody took down bank of America,

2047
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:21,350
they'd say, Yo, we did this right.

2048
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:24,190
But what actually happened
is it just was not working.

2049
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:28,240
And Bank of America said we're having
service issues and it was never properly,

2050
01:50:28,290 --> 01:50:31,690
uh, no journalists properly looked into
this. I don't know what the cause was,

2051
01:50:31,691 --> 01:50:35,470
but I know it did not appear to
be a, a, an attack of any kind.

2052
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:39,250
It appeared to be a technical problem.
And there are some people who wondered,

2053
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:43,450
is Bank of America trying to slow
what is basically run on the bag?

2054
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:46,150
Cause there are a lot of people who saw
the articles about the $5 debit card

2055
01:50:46,151 --> 01:50:46,931
thing and like,
fuck this,

2056
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:48,820
I'm just gonna move my money
out and go to another bank.

2057
01:50:48,970 --> 01:50:50,190
And they were trying
to do it on the right.

2058
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:53,080
Nowadays a bank run doesn't look
like what you see in the movies.

2059
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:55,990
It's not people running to a bank
branch and demanding their money.

2060
01:50:56,230 --> 01:50:58,710
It's people log on to their
bank account, click, you know,

2061
01:50:58,750 --> 01:51:02,200
out of Bank of America into my chase
account. Boom. Enough people did that.

2062
01:51:02,201 --> 01:51:03,340
The bank is no longer a solvent.

2063
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:08,050
So some people wondered if they were
trying to slow that outflow until they

2064
01:51:08,051 --> 01:51:10,750
could figure out a policy like do we
need to say we're not going to charge the

2065
01:51:10,751 --> 01:51:15,250
$5 fee or you know,
and then to go conspiracy on you.

2066
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:19,570
One dude even said that they're preparing,
they're testing it out to see how,

2067
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:24,550
how would we stop and actual bank run
and modern times and the best way to do

2068
01:51:24,551 --> 01:51:26,620
it, we just shut down your
mobile banking access,

2069
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,950
shut down your website access or slow it
to the point where it's difficult to do

2070
01:51:29,951 --> 01:51:33,810
stuff and you, you don't have as many
people taking out money. Oh my God,

2071
01:51:34,110 --> 01:51:37,270
that should be illegal. It should be.
It was never properly looked into that.

2072
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:39,940
Like I said, is there any policy
in regards to that? I don't know.

2073
01:51:39,941 --> 01:51:41,650
Like if they claim they're
having service issues,

2074
01:51:41,651 --> 01:51:45,100
I don't know how much of a role of
government has, he can't check on that.

2075
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:47,480
That seems like it was
definitely about that.

2076
01:51:47,481 --> 01:51:50,020
It's a weird coincidence of the timing.
That's what bothered me.

2077
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:52,600
Like it's one thing if a bank has
an outage because that does happen,

2078
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:54,160
but the timing was so perfect.

2079
01:51:54,161 --> 01:51:57,070
It's like if I were a big bank
and a lot of people are just, uh,

2080
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:59,950
if I were just being hemorrhaged right
now, all these people withdrawing,

2081
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:01,480
maybe I would turn off my website

2082
01:52:01,910 --> 01:52:06,470
and shouldn't that be all over CNN?
Shouldn't that be all over Fox News?

2083
01:52:06,471 --> 01:52:10,400
Customers demand answers and
rightly so. Right. And rightly so.

2084
01:52:12,170 --> 01:52:16,010
I think a western union is looking better
every day or whatever that she had a

2085
01:52:16,011 --> 01:52:18,740
hole in my back yard just throwing money,
check cashing places.

2086
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:23,860
The whole idea money is fucking terrifying
ones and Zeros and fucking decimal

2087
01:52:23,991 --> 01:52:26,050
points. What is, you're like,

2088
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:30,790
uh, I liked the thing about gold. How,
like when somebody hands you a gold coin,

2089
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,280
not that I've never actually made that
much money where if somebody hands me a

2090
01:52:33,281 --> 01:52:36,490
gold coin, but uh, when you look at
one in a store and they hand it to you,

2091
01:52:36,670 --> 01:52:38,170
it has weight,
right?

2092
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:41,290
And you know that like it's possible
this thing has thousands of years old and

2093
01:52:41,291 --> 01:52:46,220
has no rust on it. And regardless of like
what that thing is in terms of dollars,

2094
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:47,840
you know that what you have is valuable.

2095
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:51,260
And it same thing like jewelry is made
out of gold and silver and it's just

2096
01:52:51,261 --> 01:52:54,320
something like in our, in our,
uh, like little primitive brains,

2097
01:52:54,321 --> 01:52:58,220
we know like shiny metal that's
heavy and doesn't rust, has value.

2098
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:02,720
We can turn it into a million different
things. This is money, you know? Uh,

2099
01:53:02,721 --> 01:53:05,270
and then dollars seem like
more and more ridiculous.

2100
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:08,650
Do you know the ultimate ridiculous
theory on why gold is valuable?

2101
01:53:09,070 --> 01:53:13,090
What the Zacharias Hitchin theory?
I'm not knowing that Ho,

2102
01:53:13,091 --> 01:53:14,590
here we go down a crazy road.

2103
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:20,310
The ancient Sumerian text is like this
cuneiform text that was written on clay

2104
01:53:20,741 --> 01:53:23,170
tablets and it's just really odd.

2105
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:25,570
Ancient language from
about 6,000 years ago were,

2106
01:53:25,571 --> 01:53:29,020
it looks like you ever seen
like an old school nail,

2107
01:53:29,110 --> 01:53:32,310
like a nail on a really old building.
You don't have a purpose.

2108
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:37,390
It's like triangular almost.
Yeah, exactly. It's not like
a tabletop of the spike.

2109
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:40,270
It's not like that. They're,
they're more of like, like a,

2110
01:53:40,330 --> 01:53:44,650
like a steak look and sort
of a thing. Cause they were
mined out of, uh, you know,

2111
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:48,130
they were, they were iron, they were made
out of iron, these fucking things. Uh,

2112
01:53:48,290 --> 01:53:52,240
she just, what was my point is Zachariah
Zachariah sit to the cuneiform so that,

2113
01:53:52,241 --> 01:53:52,750
anyway,

2114
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:57,510
this is this weird series of lines and
it's all subject to interpretations.

2115
01:53:57,730 --> 01:54:01,480
It's really difficult stuff to,
to decipher.

2116
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,780
But this one guy,
Zacharias hitching,

2117
01:54:03,810 --> 01:54:06,070
who's a legitimate biblical
scholar and ancient linguist,

2118
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:11,730
he said that the entire thing was
about the undue knocky and that the

2119
01:54:12,161 --> 01:54:17,161
[inaudible] were an alien race that
created us like the engineer in the the

2120
01:54:17,321 --> 01:54:21,040
movie Prometheans like this was the,
this idea of the Annunaki.

2121
01:54:21,041 --> 01:54:26,041
There were these giants that created us
by mixing their DNA with primate DNA.

2122
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:26,650
Okay.

2123
01:54:26,650 --> 01:54:31,420
And that all of this was so that they
could make us work for them and mine gold

2124
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:36,250
because they needed gold particles to
suspend in their atmosphere to protect

2125
01:54:36,251 --> 01:54:40,750
them from the radiation of sounds totally
retarded that that's the answer I'm

2126
01:54:40,751 --> 01:54:43,760
going to give. When somebody asks me what
my religious beliefs, I'm going to say,

2127
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:44,951
here's what's crazy.

2128
01:54:44,951 --> 01:54:49,570
This guy wrote this shit in like the
1970s and he's a legit scholar so it's

2129
01:54:49,571 --> 01:54:51,140
really difficult to argue with them.

2130
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:55,540
Although many other legit scholars do
argue with them and completely disagree

2131
01:54:55,541 --> 01:54:57,070
with his,
with his translations of it.

2132
01:54:57,430 --> 01:55:01,090
But what his translation that what got
really weird was he wrote this in like

2133
01:55:01,091 --> 01:55:05,590
1970 and the two thousands, 2005 or
six or something like that, they were,

2134
01:55:05,591 --> 01:55:08,290
they had some sort of a
scientific symposium when
they're trying to figure out

2135
01:55:08,291 --> 01:55:12,610
what are there other alternative methods
of protecting people from radiation if

2136
01:55:12,611 --> 01:55:15,820
we lose, uh, the, uh, the, uh,
are part of our atmosphere,

2137
01:55:15,821 --> 01:55:17,230
like ozone layers and stuff like that.

2138
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:21,820
And they came up with suspending
reflective particles in the atmosphere.

2139
01:55:21,821 --> 01:55:25,660
So these people back then had no idea
that 1970, they had no idea that, well,

2140
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:29,350
this Zacharias hitching guys certainly
was no scientists in regards to, you know,

2141
01:55:29,351 --> 01:55:32,800
how to deflect radiation.
That wasn't his area of expertise.

2142
01:55:33,130 --> 01:55:37,390
So him coming up with this
as a translation from a
6,000 year old text that was

2143
01:55:37,391 --> 01:55:38,590
written on clay tablets,
right?

2144
01:55:38,770 --> 01:55:42,970
It's quite remarkable that they mean he
sang something that scientists figured

2145
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:44,520
30,
40 years later.

2146
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:47,970
And what he's saying is that reflective
particles suspended in the atmosphere

2147
01:55:47,971 --> 01:55:49,860
can protect you from
radiation, right? Well,

2148
01:55:49,861 --> 01:55:53,460
the thing about gold is gold
is unlike any other metal.

2149
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:56,850
And this is not something that you
would need back in the day when you were

2150
01:55:56,851 --> 01:55:59,170
fucking hurting. And you
know, you had a need,

2151
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:02,370
a good metal that you can make a
sword out and we can kill people.

2152
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:04,050
Gold wasn't useful in that way,

2153
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:08,610
but what it is useful and you could take
gold dust and the small piece of gold

2154
01:56:08,730 --> 01:56:13,680
can make an incredible amount
of this ultra fine dust.
And if gold has a bizarre,

2155
01:56:13,681 --> 01:56:17,820
almost magical properties where you
can take one piece of golden coat and

2156
01:56:17,821 --> 01:56:22,360
incredibly wide surface with
the most, uh, towards ductile,

2157
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:23,820
it's the most ductile metal there is.

2158
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:27,930
You can bang it out into this thin little
flake. Yeah, it's an amazing metal.

2159
01:56:27,931 --> 01:56:32,400
It's a really bizarre and amazing mental
and that it would be the perfect mental

2160
01:56:32,401 --> 01:56:35,220
for suspending in our atmosphere
to protect us from radiation.

2161
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:38,460
And that Earth has, uh, you know, a,

2162
01:56:38,470 --> 01:56:41,550
a whole area where there's a lot of gold.

2163
01:56:41,610 --> 01:56:45,330
So these aliens came down here realize
that this is a good place for them to get

2164
01:56:45,331 --> 01:56:48,660
some gold out of how do you do it? I
don't want to let's make some people well,

2165
01:56:48,661 --> 01:56:52,140
okay, that's, it makes me, she grabbed
some monkeys, the through some DNA in him.

2166
01:56:52,290 --> 01:56:53,730
It's completely ridiculous.

2167
01:56:54,070 --> 01:56:57,790
Cowboy to add. But it's not to add
credibility to your theory. Okay.

2168
01:56:57,940 --> 01:57:02,710
A cowboys and aliens. Yes. You seen that?
Sure. There are there to harvest gold.

2169
01:57:03,130 --> 01:57:06,040
Yeah. You know? Yeah. I
don't think that helps us.

2170
01:57:07,170 --> 01:57:11,920
I'm being sarcastic about being
sarcastic about was looking forward to it

2171
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:12,830
movie so bad.

2172
01:57:13,070 --> 01:57:16,820
But the idea was that that's why we still
have this thing for gold that we were

2173
01:57:16,821 --> 01:57:18,890
literally put on earth to mine for gold.

2174
01:57:18,891 --> 01:57:21,380
So we still think it's nice
connection with value. Wow.

2175
01:57:21,530 --> 01:57:26,060
And then we've lost completely lost all
of our memories of the Annunaki cause

2176
01:57:26,061 --> 01:57:28,260
this is thousands upon thousands.

2177
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:30,240
What if it's less sinister than that?

2178
01:57:30,241 --> 01:57:33,000
And it's like they came to earth
and they're like, look guys,

2179
01:57:33,001 --> 01:57:36,780
we need gold for our project
and the atmosphere thing.

2180
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:41,580
So you give us gold and we'll give you
stuff that you need and then you have

2181
01:57:41,581 --> 01:57:45,420
people suddenly realizing,
okay, Gold's money, you know?
Oh yeah. It could be that.

2182
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:47,310
What's,
what's interesting about,

2183
01:57:47,311 --> 01:57:50,370
I don't like the idea of being an
engineered by like biologically engineered

2184
01:57:50,371 --> 01:57:51,204
slave.

2185
01:57:51,390 --> 01:57:54,780
What would the, the reason why
I lean towards that and not,

2186
01:57:54,781 --> 01:57:58,620
not 100% I mean,
I don't agree with it or disagree with it,

2187
01:57:58,621 --> 01:58:02,310
but I don't reject it as an idea simply
because of the fact that the only thing

2188
01:58:02,311 --> 01:58:03,780
that's like us,
his dogs,

2189
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:08,760
the only thing that's like us that can
vary so widely by the way it looks is

2190
01:58:08,761 --> 01:58:13,170
humans. We're the only thing
that [inaudible] like a dog dogs.

2191
01:58:13,171 --> 01:58:17,480
Very incredibly man. You
can have Max. Wow, us. Yeah,

2192
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:21,240
because they were like, we there
were designed, right. We made them,

2193
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:26,270
they vary because of human
intervention and I mean maybe it's a,

2194
01:58:26,461 --> 01:58:27,990
what came first?
The chicken or the egg,

2195
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:33,020
maybe human innovation
came and then people varied
drastically or when they were

2196
01:58:34,261 --> 01:58:37,740
fucking created, they made a bunch
of different versions of them.

2197
01:58:37,741 --> 01:58:39,270
They tried a little bit of this.

2198
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:42,010
They went with like Asians
probably have little more alien in

2199
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:45,070
them just to touch just a smidge.
I'm Italian.

2200
01:58:45,071 --> 01:58:49,120
I probably have a little more monkey,
you know, they probably, and by the way,

2201
01:58:49,121 --> 01:58:52,000
this is not racist to alien
to agents because it's better,

2202
01:58:52,001 --> 01:58:55,540
I think probably to be more evolved,
it's better to have little less monkey.

2203
01:58:55,541 --> 01:58:57,460
So it's actually racist against myself.

2204
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:02,140
So I don't want any fucking Twitter beef
over this, but it's ridiculous. Look,

2205
01:59:02,141 --> 01:59:04,600
it's written. It's totally, completely
ridiculous. It's, I don't know,

2206
01:59:04,601 --> 01:59:08,210
and I don't believe in it, but I propose
it. Who the fuck knows? Man? We're,

2207
01:59:08,211 --> 01:59:10,600
we're starting to learn all sorts
of crazy shit about our past.

2208
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:14,290
We're starting to learn about ancient
civilizations in it at a time where we did

2209
01:59:14,291 --> 01:59:16,480
not think that people were
capable of building anything.

2210
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:20,590
And if they have these giant
stone structures in South
America back. No sense.

2211
01:59:20,830 --> 01:59:22,610
Timeline wise, that's another thing. Like,

2212
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:25,690
I remember going through school and you
read the textbooks about Columbus and

2213
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:29,560
all this basic shit. Not once
those textbooks are, they
mentioned, oh, by the way,

2214
01:59:29,561 --> 01:59:32,830
there's some random cities in
South America. Yeah. Bill, uh,

2215
01:59:33,370 --> 01:59:35,680
in a way that's like really doesn't
make sense at that time period.

2216
01:59:35,681 --> 01:59:38,230
And they're so far, I don't have
the numbers in my mind right now,

2217
01:59:38,231 --> 01:59:42,340
but they were so distant to everything
else that it's like we don't have any

2218
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:46,300
idea of what that is. Yeah. And well not
only that, there's thousands of them,

2219
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,550
they're finding new ones
and the jungle all the time.

2220
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:52,390
I mean it was an incredible civilization
that existed just a couple thousand

2221
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:55,090
years ago. The, the Mayan civilization
wasn't even that long ago.

2222
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:59,290
And we know so little about what really
happened. It's, it's an an amazing,

2223
01:59:59,291 --> 02:00:00,250
amazing time.

2224
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:05,400
I watched a great documentary on National
Geographic called decoding the Maya.

2225
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:06,191
It's available.

2226
02:00:06,191 --> 02:00:11,191
I bought a DVD of it and it's all about
them working on the translations of a,

2227
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:16,510
the different Mayan hieroglyphs
and how difficult it is and like,

2228
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:20,980
like trying to decipher things and the
way they go about it and the scientific

2229
02:00:20,981 --> 02:00:23,680
method they use to try to figure out
what the fuck each little thing means.

2230
02:00:23,681 --> 02:00:25,810
And fascinating stuff.
I mean,

2231
02:00:25,811 --> 02:00:30,280
they had a completely different
way of writing the world.

2232
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:35,140
They wrote the world in pictures and
pictures that represented sounds that you

2233
02:00:35,141 --> 02:00:39,790
would make and they would vary. It would
vary whether or not that sound was like,

2234
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:40,391
you know,

2235
02:00:40,391 --> 02:00:45,220
like if you had like they would like
the way it's explained it transport can

2236
02:00:45,221 --> 02:00:48,520
explain it. Like if you were going
to look right, I saw aunt rose,

2237
02:00:48,670 --> 02:00:53,670
you would do an eyeball a saw like
saw and then you do at the insect and,

2238
02:00:53,850 --> 02:00:56,460
and then you would do a rose
and that would be, I saw him,

2239
02:00:56,500 --> 02:01:01,460
he also had human sacrifice. A lot
of it. Yeah. I read Daniel Pinch,

2240
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:05,380
Pinch Beck's book. Uh, he
seems really interesting.

2241
02:01:05,770 --> 02:01:07,660
I read actually a,
he wouldn't get high with us.

2242
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:11,320
You had on the show and we would not
get high with the I kid high with, uh,

2243
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:12,920
why did you, you don't
want to be like, oh,

2244
02:01:12,921 --> 02:01:15,370
maybe you didn't want to get weirded out.
You don't want to be a, what's the word?

2245
02:01:15,371 --> 02:01:17,860
Like do it for show maybe.

2246
02:01:17,861 --> 02:01:20,440
I think some people also get
uncomfortable when they're high,

2247
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:22,360
when they're on and they're
talking about things seriously.

2248
02:01:22,361 --> 02:01:26,150
They didn't want to come up with
too much dude, bro Talk. Right.

2249
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:28,540
You know they're worried about
people seeing them stoned,

2250
02:01:28,930 --> 02:01:30,700
but I thought he's like the
psychedelic pioneer dude.

2251
02:01:30,701 --> 02:01:33,400
I thought he would hop right in. Yeah.
Yeah. I met him when I was in boulder.

2252
02:01:33,490 --> 02:01:37,000
Anthony Bordain two fisted,
like a soldier.

2253
02:01:37,450 --> 02:01:40,040
We took that due to the depths
of unfortunately because

2254
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,470
it made the conversation kind of weird
because he was a little hung over from

2255
02:01:42,471 --> 02:01:46,760
the grammys. That motherfucker went
deep with us, respects our respect.

2256
02:01:46,790 --> 02:01:49,910
I got respect for you. I could tell
how he was too, cause I know it.

2257
02:01:49,911 --> 02:01:53,600
Unless you're getting this
shit on a regular basis that
the the there's the kind

2258
02:01:53,601 --> 02:01:55,730
of marijuana that's available
in southern California.

2259
02:01:55,731 --> 02:02:00,731
It's so potent and so awesome and
should be respected for that instead of

2260
02:02:01,611 --> 02:02:06,611
suppressed by this ridiculous
fucking d e a and government.

2261
02:02:06,710 --> 02:02:09,580
We are in so silly.
We're in a new era of prohibition.

2262
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:10,423
That's one of the things that are,

2263
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:12,830
it's one of things I'm going to legislate
and might not actually get it through,

2264
02:02:13,490 --> 02:02:17,450
but you can start putting the bills out
there. What are you going to try to do?

2265
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:21,320
It has to be decriminalized. It's not
even like the main focus of my campaign,

2266
02:02:21,321 --> 02:02:25,370
like my thing is bill of rights and
spying on us, like ending those things.

2267
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:29,660
But do you think it's possible to turn
things back and absolutely is possible

2268
02:02:29,661 --> 02:02:31,670
because uh,
the latest polls,

2269
02:02:31,671 --> 02:02:36,050
like 50% of the American people support
decriminalization and legalization,

2270
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:39,410
but elected officials only
one to 2% support that.

2271
02:02:39,530 --> 02:02:43,160
So you have a huge disparity where these
old assholes have have to go or they

2272
02:02:43,161 --> 02:02:44,210
have to change their,

2273
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:47,150
their a stance because it's not
going to stay like that forever.

2274
02:02:47,151 --> 02:02:51,830
You don't have an elected body that
believes a one thing and then 50% of your

2275
02:02:51,831 --> 02:02:54,860
own people believe something
entirely different that doesn't work.

2276
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:57,680
And it's not much different than
when Galileo was in position.

2277
02:02:57,860 --> 02:03:01,430
It's really sort of along the same
lines we'd cause it grows absolutely

2278
02:03:01,431 --> 02:03:02,030
everywhere.

2279
02:03:02,030 --> 02:03:05,960
You find it by railroad tracks and you
just pulled out of the ground and it's

2280
02:03:05,961 --> 02:03:07,010
super nutritious.
Yeah.

2281
02:03:07,070 --> 02:03:09,650
And you can make clothes out of it and
you can build buildings out of it as a

2282
02:03:09,651 --> 02:03:11,390
bottle of whiskey. Do all that. I mean,

2283
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:15,200
you could fucking fuel a car with
that shit. Really. Realistically,

2284
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:19,700
you could take one acre of hemp.
It's as good as four acres of trees.

2285
02:03:19,701 --> 02:03:22,850
If you're trying to make paper,
it's the most ridiculous plan ever.

2286
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:26,460
I'm not trying to, uh, to pander
to your show because I know,

2287
02:03:26,461 --> 02:03:27,440
I know you talked about this a lot,

2288
02:03:27,441 --> 02:03:31,370
but like we can't move forward as a
country if we're spending so much of our

2289
02:03:31,371 --> 02:03:34,880
resources on criminalize the something
that it's not a crime. Not only that,

2290
02:03:34,881 --> 02:03:37,310
something that's incredibly,
incredibly beneficial.

2291
02:03:37,311 --> 02:03:41,300
We're suppressing farmer's ability to
make money of farmer's ability to make

2292
02:03:41,301 --> 02:03:43,370
money. By the way, not off selling drugs.

2293
02:03:43,490 --> 02:03:47,030
We're talking about the actual plant hemp,
which is not psychoactive in any way,

2294
02:03:47,031 --> 02:03:50,500
shape or form. It is not what you
won't show. You can eat it. I eat,

2295
02:03:50,630 --> 02:03:54,530
we sell hemp protein, hemp force protein.
One of the biggest questions we get is,

2296
02:03:54,710 --> 02:03:58,100
am I going to Piss hot for this? I work,
you know, at a company that drug test me,

2297
02:03:58,101 --> 02:04:01,130
should I be like, yeah, you
can tell. It's not that.

2298
02:04:01,131 --> 02:04:04,910
It's nothing to do with that marijuana.
It's disgusting to terrifying.

2299
02:04:05,090 --> 02:04:07,850
I'm of the age where I have a lot of
friends who are like trying to get into

2300
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,820
better positions and they're
all worried about drug testing.

2301
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:14,900
It's weird because there are all these
companies are like preventing themselves

2302
02:04:14,901 --> 02:04:17,760
from hiring the next batch of
innovators. Yeah, of course.

2303
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:21,830
Like you're hiring people who are
complete boring accountants who have never

2304
02:04:21,831 --> 02:04:25,970
tried anything. And I'm so offended at
this idea that no one can handle drugs.

2305
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:26,600
And I,

2306
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:31,600
I find that so ridiculous that just
because one person can handle it or a few

2307
02:04:31,611 --> 02:04:35,090
people can handle it doesn't mean I can't
handle it because drinking is one of

2308
02:04:35,091 --> 02:04:39,330
the worst fucking drugs there is period.
Right. I can handle it. I enjoy drinking.

2309
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:40,470
There's no doubt.

2310
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:44,340
You compare how your body feels the
next day between the two things. Uh,

2311
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:47,100
there's no doubt.
There's no comparison.

2312
02:04:47,101 --> 02:04:51,450
And the idea that I would somehow or
another lose control because I've tried

2313
02:04:51,451 --> 02:04:53,820
something or because I enjoy
something in my off time.

2314
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:58,590
It's silly if you don't give a person
enough respect as your employee that they

2315
02:04:58,591 --> 02:05:02,820
will go home and sit down in front of
the TV and smoke a joint when they,

2316
02:05:02,821 --> 02:05:04,890
when they relax at home.
Right?

2317
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:08,010
You don't give them enough respect
to have that time to themselves,

2318
02:05:08,011 --> 02:05:10,800
to maybe smoke a little weed and chill
out when they're not riding on the

2319
02:05:10,801 --> 02:05:13,080
company dime then not doing.
They're not responsible for anything.

2320
02:05:13,170 --> 02:05:17,370
You're going to test them for that.
That's ridiculous. You, you're an asshole.

2321
02:05:17,371 --> 02:05:20,310
You're trying to be a slave owner.
You're not trying to be an employee.

2322
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:22,620
You can't tell people what to
do when they're not at work.

2323
02:05:23,130 --> 02:05:25,230
It's one thing if you're on
an oil, one of those, uh,

2324
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:29,340
offshore oil rigs and then
you're basically on the
job 24 hours a day because

2325
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:30,930
anything can go wrong at any time.

2326
02:05:30,970 --> 02:05:34,110
Completely understand having
a zero tolerance policy bear,

2327
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:38,430
but for some office job where you have
a large portion of your day where you're

2328
02:05:38,431 --> 02:05:40,500
not working,
you should be allowed to do what you want,

2329
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:43,890
especially when you're using something
that is not killed a single person ever.

2330
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:47,730
It's very, very, very good point
about dangerous jobs. Very good point.

2331
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,400
It's not that we're being completely
unreasonable and you're like,

2332
02:05:50,401 --> 02:05:54,500
governments do that in my
life. Everywhere. No government
government, we should,

2333
02:05:54,510 --> 02:05:57,960
we should definitely check people
out before we let them on planes.

2334
02:05:57,961 --> 02:06:02,280
We should definitely test people for
drugs if they're in charge of oil rigs and

2335
02:06:02,281 --> 02:06:04,890
you know, even even spine,
like people think I'm uh,

2336
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:08,100
I'm totally against intelligence
agencies have not, like,

2337
02:06:08,101 --> 02:06:10,260
there's a big role for
us to have spy agencies.

2338
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:13,410
Like you want to see what these fucking
people in Afghanistan and caves are

2339
02:06:13,411 --> 02:06:14,244
talking about.

2340
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:17,130
You want to be tapping their sat
talking about how do I make a fire?

2341
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:20,190
How do we hold it in this case?

2342
02:06:20,191 --> 02:06:23,210
How do we get these drones to
stop dropping stuff on us? Yeah.

2343
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:24,690
What's your position on drones?

2344
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:28,680
So drones are really pretty awful for a
lot of the same reasons is warrantless

2345
02:06:28,681 --> 02:06:30,900
spine. There's not enough
accountability. Like right now,

2346
02:06:30,901 --> 02:06:32,940
maybe it's being used properly.
We really don't know.

2347
02:06:33,130 --> 02:06:36,600
But at what point does it just become
convenient for a president to say, look,

2348
02:06:36,601 --> 02:06:40,470
this guy has a major asshole. He's causing
us a lot of trouble with all of his,

2349
02:06:40,471 --> 02:06:43,580
uh, uh, let's say like down the road
somebody like Julian Assange was like,

2350
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:46,050
let's just get rid of this guy,
one drone strike, he's done.

2351
02:06:46,290 --> 02:06:48,990
And then people will talk about it
for a couple of days and that's it.

2352
02:06:48,990 --> 02:06:50,520
Cause that's how the media cycle works.
You know,

2353
02:06:50,521 --> 02:06:52,470
people would be outraged for
a couple days and that's it.

2354
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:56,390
So they take their one time, credibility
hit and they just move on. And I don't,

2355
02:06:56,391 --> 02:06:58,380
I don't think that's acceptable.
Again,

2356
02:06:58,381 --> 02:07:00,930
it's too much power for
the government to have the,

2357
02:07:00,931 --> 02:07:05,931
a number of civilian drones
is in or civilian casualties
because of drones is in

2358
02:07:07,081 --> 02:07:10,340
the thousands now. I mean
it's, it's not just a,

2359
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:14,160
a couple of people accidentally die.
Also, there's an evil aspect to it.

2360
02:07:14,161 --> 02:07:16,920
Like it used to be if you
wanted to kill somebody,

2361
02:07:16,921 --> 02:07:19,920
you stabbed them with something and
it was pretty intimate, you know,

2362
02:07:20,250 --> 02:07:22,320
and then it's, it's been
depersonalized. That were time.

2363
02:07:22,321 --> 02:07:26,190
It went from that to start a ride to
sniper rifles to you drop something out of

2364
02:07:26,191 --> 02:07:30,810
a plane. Yeah. But even then,
you're still on top of their city.

2365
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:35,230
You're looking down, you're pushing the
button, you're making a moral choice. Like

2366
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,730
the evil I'm doing here is outweighed
by the benefit it will have of winning

2367
02:07:39,731 --> 02:07:42,750
this battle or winning this war.
The drone.

2368
02:07:42,751 --> 02:07:45,910
Some guy just goes to work
at an army base, plugs in,

2369
02:07:45,911 --> 02:07:49,390
like he's playing a video game, goes home
at night, mission accomplished. You know,

2370
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:54,610
it's a, it's a level of separation
that is, uh, just scary.

2371
02:07:55,140 --> 02:07:59,220
Yeah. These civilian drones trikes
depending on who you listen to, there's,

2372
02:07:59,221 --> 02:08:02,220
there's a, there's a couple different
figures that they throw around,

2373
02:08:02,221 --> 02:08:05,910
but all of them are over a thousand
from the conservative numbers.

2374
02:08:05,911 --> 02:08:10,710
The conservative numbers around 1,802
and the less conservative numbers are

2375
02:08:10,711 --> 02:08:14,970
above 2000. But either that, I mean,
all of that, that's scary stuff.

2376
02:08:14,971 --> 02:08:16,320
That's like nine,
11 numbers.

2377
02:08:16,321 --> 02:08:19,920
I mean this is the amount of innocent
civilians that are killed because we're

2378
02:08:19,921 --> 02:08:22,830
going after these bad guys and these
people just have to be near him. Yeah.

2379
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:27,510
It happened to me near him. Allegedly
the, there is, I agree completely.

2380
02:08:27,511 --> 02:08:32,400
There's something crazy about
the ability to take some random,

2381
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:35,040
you know, object, some,

2382
02:08:35,041 --> 02:08:39,180
some created object rather and fly it
through the fucking air to another country

2383
02:08:39,181 --> 02:08:42,810
and it launches hell fire missiles at
people while you're controlling it with a

2384
02:08:42,811 --> 02:08:44,640
remote control,
like you're watching a video game.

2385
02:08:44,910 --> 02:08:48,140
And what's, what's so weird about
that also is like, so as a society,

2386
02:08:48,141 --> 02:08:52,010
we're making a choice to devote a lot of
our technological energy and definitely

2387
02:08:52,011 --> 02:08:55,760
taxpayer money to building better drones
because these big defense contracts get

2388
02:08:55,761 --> 02:08:57,130
them.
And uh,

2389
02:08:57,320 --> 02:09:01,370
so we're learning ways to like vaporize
16 year olds in a more efficient manner.

2390
02:09:01,371 --> 02:09:04,730
Basically these people who are like,
you're in some town in Afghanistan,

2391
02:09:04,731 --> 02:09:08,480
you have no other choices cause there's
no economy and some more lord recruits

2392
02:09:08,481 --> 02:09:11,750
you and you're caught up in something
that's definitely evil but you don't have

2393
02:09:11,751 --> 02:09:14,690
much control over necessarily.
And without being given a trial,

2394
02:09:14,691 --> 02:09:17,320
you're just killed one day by a
robot. Basically. That's what it is,

2395
02:09:17,321 --> 02:09:21,560
is a robot in the sky. I think Bill
Maher calls them sky robots. Uh,

2396
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:23,570
so you're killed by this thing.

2397
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:28,600
And maybe if we need to give
huge contracts to defense
companies because they

2398
02:09:28,641 --> 02:09:31,850
lobbied the shit out of Washington, if
that's just the way it is, no matter what,

2399
02:09:31,851 --> 02:09:33,680
we always have to give
them massive contracts.

2400
02:09:33,860 --> 02:09:37,130
Why not go back to what we were doing in
the 60s which was part of those massive

2401
02:09:37,131 --> 02:09:39,290
contracts. We're going to
the space program. You know,

2402
02:09:39,291 --> 02:09:42,170
these companies put us on the
moon instead of building drones.

2403
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:44,800
Well,
let's just cleaning up the inner cities,

2404
02:09:44,801 --> 02:09:47,230
just strengthening our education system.

2405
02:09:47,231 --> 02:09:50,950
There's all sorts of jobs that
can be had that are very positive.

2406
02:09:50,951 --> 02:09:55,951
Instead of these jobs that all go to
the DEA and busting pot farms and these

2407
02:09:56,141 --> 02:10:00,340
jobs that all go to Tsa workers grabbing
people and sticking them in radiation

2408
02:10:00,341 --> 02:10:01,091
boxes,
they're seen.

2409
02:10:01,091 --> 02:10:06,091
It seems to me like we should be able
to figure out a way to distribute all

2410
02:10:06,191 --> 02:10:10,690
those people in a positive way back
into our economy, back into our work.

2411
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:13,520
Yes. And lead police aren't
bad everywhere you go.

2412
02:10:13,521 --> 02:10:16,970
Like I've traveled to a lot of places
where the police actually seemed like

2413
02:10:16,971 --> 02:10:20,210
members of the community in small towns
where there's less pressure in small

2414
02:10:20,211 --> 02:10:23,420
towns and, and other countries
where the cops don't have uniforms.

2415
02:10:23,421 --> 02:10:24,530
So they look like judge Dredd.

2416
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:28,090
Like here I've noticed the uniforms could
keep getting scarier and scarier. Uh,

2417
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:31,440
it depends on the city obviously. But
you know, they seen the Cammo. Yeah.

2418
02:10:33,010 --> 02:10:34,190
Irvine in south Florida,

2419
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:38,000
the guys have like body vests
on. It wasn't, it wasn't
Irvine. What was the, um,

2420
02:10:38,001 --> 02:10:40,490
the city in Orange
County, Anaheim, Anaheim,

2421
02:10:40,491 --> 02:10:44,000
there was a protest that was a total
joke as a total media blackout.

2422
02:10:44,001 --> 02:10:47,690
That Anaheim thing started to escalate.
So nothing about in the news.

2423
02:10:47,691 --> 02:10:49,100
I had to just Google news it,
you know,

2424
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,840
he just gives routes
where Disneyland is bitch,

2425
02:10:50,900 --> 02:10:53,660
they know how to keep shitting on
the raft. Disneyland. But I mean,

2426
02:10:53,661 --> 02:10:56,480
they had people in camouflage
and you're like, what do you,

2427
02:10:56,810 --> 02:10:58,820
what is the message of
you being in camouflage?

2428
02:10:58,821 --> 02:11:00,350
Is that the only clothes you have?
Right?

2429
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:02,420
Or are you letting me know
that you've killed people?

2430
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:05,090
Are you letting me know that you're
a trained killer from overseas?

2431
02:11:05,110 --> 02:11:08,090
You're not looking around number
of the community keeping the piece.

2432
02:11:08,091 --> 02:11:09,920
Are you ready for some serious shit?
Yeah.

2433
02:11:09,921 --> 02:11:13,580
Why are you wearing body armor and why
do you have a fucking machine gun and why

2434
02:11:13,581 --> 02:11:17,390
you standing around when people were
protesting the death of, of uh, you know,

2435
02:11:17,391 --> 02:11:19,730
a young man was shot in the back,
the whole thing.

2436
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:23,780
How about the fucking guy that shot
himself in the head in the backseat?

2437
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:26,570
That was fucked up.
I don't think we ruled it a suicide.

2438
02:11:26,571 --> 02:11:28,080
I don't believe that for a second.
But the,

2439
02:11:28,081 --> 02:11:31,670
the brazen act of ruling that the suicide,
that,

2440
02:11:32,010 --> 02:11:35,900
that shit is completely ridiculous.
How the fuck did they get away with that?

2441
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:38,540
Right. It's part of when you could
get a society that's corrupt,

2442
02:11:38,541 --> 02:11:39,680
you have corrupt rulings,

2443
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:43,100
but the fact that people would be willing
to just listen to that and go, yeah,

2444
02:11:43,101 --> 02:11:47,240
wow, okay. I shouldn't have shot himself
in the head. You pull the guy over,

2445
02:11:47,241 --> 02:11:49,470
you arrest him and he's like,
this is it. My life's over.

2446
02:11:49,471 --> 02:11:53,200
I'm going to shoot myself in the head
while I'm handcuffed behind my back and

2447
02:11:53,201 --> 02:11:54,550
I'm a shoot myself in the temple.
Yeah.

2448
02:11:54,590 --> 02:11:57,270
The next few hours is going to
be inconvenient being processed,

2449
02:11:57,271 --> 02:11:59,300
so I'm just going to kill
myself. Yeah. I mean, no sense.

2450
02:11:59,301 --> 02:12:01,680
I'm going to put it up to my temple too.
Yeah.

2451
02:12:02,570 --> 02:12:06,630
How can you even fucking do
that? Can you even do that? Well,

2452
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:08,280
what you have to be like a yoga chick.

2453
02:12:08,350 --> 02:12:11,180
What scares me is when these videos come
out of police just beating the shit out

2454
02:12:11,181 --> 02:12:14,300
of somebody for no reason and you wonder
like how many times is this happening,

2455
02:12:14,301 --> 02:12:16,490
where the right conditions weren't there,

2456
02:12:16,491 --> 02:12:20,060
where there happened to be somebody who
had the balls and the camera and the

2457
02:12:20,061 --> 02:12:23,690
camera to actually film it. You
know, when I was in high school,

2458
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:26,480
my friend Jimmy was, uh, in, um,

2459
02:12:27,080 --> 02:12:31,220
there's a place called Kenmore Square in
Boston and this is back when they had,

2460
02:12:31,221 --> 02:12:33,910
um, they had dudes who would, uh,

2461
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:37,500
put cardboard down on the street
and they would break dance. Yeah,

2462
02:12:37,540 --> 02:12:40,400
I used to do that. Remember that
ship? It was really popular. Well,

2463
02:12:40,401 --> 02:12:44,930
there was break dancers and these
punkers, there was like a, a bar there.

2464
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:47,910
There's so, there's like these
punk people and these breakdowns.

2465
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:52,960
People got into a fucking crazy bra and
the cops come and showed up and patty

2466
02:12:53,241 --> 02:12:55,520
wagons and he said he had
never seen anything like it.

2467
02:12:55,760 --> 02:13:00,170
Dudes were just swinging those bats and
cow racking people in the head because

2468
02:13:00,171 --> 02:13:03,080
there's no video, there's
no, no one's monitoring them.

2469
02:13:03,620 --> 02:13:07,340
He said they would crack people in the
head. He goes, the sound was so sickening.

2470
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:11,510
And then they would take their head and
slam it into the patty wagon before they

2471
02:13:11,511 --> 02:13:11,961
go in.

2472
02:13:11,961 --> 02:13:15,380
Everyone just slam their fucking head
into the metal and then toss them in.

2473
02:13:15,710 --> 02:13:19,070
He said it was so disturbing that
like watching it and they're like,

2474
02:13:19,071 --> 02:13:20,840
he never looked at cops
the same way again.

2475
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:25,880
Just watching them just get cracked in
the head by bats and then slam their head

2476
02:13:25,881 --> 02:13:29,900
into the metal and then push them in
because they were involved in a big brawl.

2477
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:30,470
Right.

2478
02:13:30,470 --> 02:13:33,840
And that was back when people had brawls
where they didn't shoot each other.

2479
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:36,570
They just beat each other up.
Like those don't exist anymore.

2480
02:13:37,190 --> 02:13:39,080
Allegedly.
Some of those occupy protesters,

2481
02:13:39,081 --> 02:13:42,890
they like what handcuffed them in a way
that's painful using the plastic cuffs

2482
02:13:43,220 --> 02:13:46,940
and they show them all into vans and,
uh, they were in there for so long,

2483
02:13:46,941 --> 02:13:48,590
they're forced to urinate on each other.

2484
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:52,840
Even like they were denied access to a
bathroom when they asked for one. And uh,

2485
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:54,600
you,
you hear about this all the time,

2486
02:13:54,601 --> 02:13:57,560
like where they're doing the handcuffs
so hard that people are screaming from

2487
02:13:57,561 --> 02:14:01,310
going to be like fixed, you know, and
they just don't care. It's so sick.

2488
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:05,540
That's not, that's not, uh, that's
not what America is about. You know,

2489
02:14:05,930 --> 02:14:08,320
we have the freedom of protest.
So when I see people protesting,

2490
02:14:08,321 --> 02:14:11,000
I'm actually kind of excited because it
means that people are engaging again.

2491
02:14:11,001 --> 02:14:13,130
You know, they're like, okay,
I care about this issue.

2492
02:14:13,131 --> 02:14:16,070
I'm going to tell you what I think
of it. That's a good thing. Uh,

2493
02:14:16,130 --> 02:14:20,120
having debate and discussion, that's,
that's a sign of life, you know,

2494
02:14:20,121 --> 02:14:23,240
and they're treating it like it's this
threat to our existence in a threat to

2495
02:14:23,241 --> 02:14:24,740
national security.
It's super creepy.

2496
02:14:24,850 --> 02:14:26,370
One of the creepy things was a,

2497
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:31,060
we had Jamie Kilstein on who's been a
very involved in the occupy process from

2498
02:14:31,061 --> 02:14:35,590
the beginning, and he was talking to me
about cops that have products, no cops,

2499
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:39,680
police officer, police officers that
have infiltrated and they pretend yeah.

2500
02:14:39,730 --> 02:14:43,240
To be, uh, yeah, the agent
provocateurs. Yeah. That,

2501
02:14:43,270 --> 02:14:46,600
that strikes me is one of the most fucked
up things also that you get paid for

2502
02:14:46,601 --> 02:14:50,620
that public protest. It's peaceful
and isn't harming the community.

2503
02:14:50,770 --> 02:14:53,710
Then you have exactly you of taxpayer
money going into turning this into a

2504
02:14:53,711 --> 02:14:54,880
violent death

2505
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:56,420
orderly thing.
It should be.

2506
02:14:56,421 --> 02:14:59,180
So you can bust people who would not
have been an issue in the first place.

2507
02:14:59,181 --> 02:15:01,210
It'd be treason. Yeah. It
should be complete treason.

2508
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:03,650
If you find out that someone has ever
done that and they have done that,

2509
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:06,800
it should be absolutely treasonous.
You should go to jail. You have,

2510
02:15:06,801 --> 02:15:08,750
you fucked up the,
the,

2511
02:15:08,751 --> 02:15:12,920
the civil discourse of this situation
that is against the Sim, the community,

2512
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:17,450
your, your, you are, your
actions are undermining the
piece of the community. Yeah.

2513
02:15:17,540 --> 02:15:20,720
You should go to jail.
They should all in the fact that it just,

2514
02:15:20,721 --> 02:15:25,030
we're just allowed that and we just
sort of accept that that level of,

2515
02:15:25,090 --> 02:15:29,300
of not, not just incompetence on
the part but, but real corruption.

2516
02:15:29,330 --> 02:15:32,480
It's not in competence. It's
institutional. Like you said,

2517
02:15:32,481 --> 02:15:34,550
it's not the people at the
bottom level who are the problem.

2518
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:36,140
Somebody up top is saying,
look,

2519
02:15:36,141 --> 02:15:39,230
you better rough these protesters up
cause we don't want them coming back next

2520
02:15:39,230 --> 02:15:40,970
weekend and they're so
stupid. This is the, this,

2521
02:15:40,971 --> 02:15:43,640
the incompetence is that this is the only
way they feel like they can handle it

2522
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:46,690
and let's even stupid or is this
what's going to lead to bigger protest?

2523
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:50,200
Of course, because the
denial of, of, of equality,

2524
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:52,190
the fact that they won't consider these,

2525
02:15:52,191 --> 02:15:53,840
that these people are a
part of the community.

2526
02:15:53,841 --> 02:15:56,210
When the community is having this
much problem with your action,

2527
02:15:56,390 --> 02:15:58,420
you're doing something wrong.
There's something wrong, there's an,

2528
02:15:58,460 --> 02:16:02,720
then there's an injustice. It's not an
unreasonable, ridiculous thing. Like,

2529
02:16:02,721 --> 02:16:04,070
you know,
some crazy person's saying,

2530
02:16:04,071 --> 02:16:06,690
you stole all my money from
the golden giant. No, you're,

2531
02:16:06,691 --> 02:16:10,070
you're talking like real sense and
deciding and you're being ignored.

2532
02:16:10,370 --> 02:16:14,360
And when that happens, it's, it's right
to protest. It's American to protest.

2533
02:16:14,361 --> 02:16:17,480
It's patriotic to protest.
It shows that you're,

2534
02:16:17,481 --> 02:16:20,690
you're stepping outside of
the box to say, hey, I am one.

2535
02:16:20,691 --> 02:16:23,450
I want to be counted amongst the people
that think there's something wrong with

2536
02:16:23,451 --> 02:16:26,570
this. That's what America
is supposed to be all about.

2537
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:29,710
So the problem with Americans,
it's run by an American's.

2538
02:16:30,910 --> 02:16:32,650
It's run by people who are not.

2539
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,550
I have a lot of people who believe that
nine 11 was like the opportunity of a

2540
02:16:36,551 --> 02:16:40,930
lifetime. Yeah. You know,
get a better, get a better
position within the government,

2541
02:16:41,390 --> 02:16:44,320
make a shitload of money
on these crazy contracts,

2542
02:16:44,321 --> 02:16:47,890
doing spying programs and putting body
scanners and airports and all this stuff.

2543
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:51,820
A lot of people made money off of this
and I consider that quite unamerican to

2544
02:16:51,821 --> 02:16:54,910
profit off of a tragedy like
that and in such a blatant way.

2545
02:16:54,911 --> 02:16:58,450
You know what was quite unamerican have
Dick Cheney as a vice president. Yeah.

2546
02:16:58,570 --> 02:16:59,351
How crazy is that?

2547
02:16:59,351 --> 02:17:02,860
To have this guy who was a vice president
who used to be the CEO of a company

2548
02:17:02,861 --> 02:17:07,300
that fixes shit after you book? Well, the
whole thing there, if we weren't corrupt,

2549
02:17:07,330 --> 02:17:10,720
we should have just said, okay great.
You're a CEO of Halliburton, no big deal,

2550
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:13,780
but no government contracts
while you're in office.

2551
02:17:13,990 --> 02:17:17,620
We're not sending a penny to Halliburton
cause it's a total conflict of interest.

2552
02:17:17,950 --> 02:17:18,250
You know,

2553
02:17:18,250 --> 02:17:21,160
I don't understand why government gets
away with things that in the financial

2554
02:17:21,161 --> 02:17:23,510
sector would just be considered ludicrous.
Insider trading.

2555
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:26,650
Exactly thing much less
horrible than that. Yeah.

2556
02:17:26,651 --> 02:17:29,320
It just knew that a company was going
to fold and you sold your stock. Yep.

2557
02:17:29,350 --> 02:17:32,530
That seems like a smart business move,
but that's completely and totally illegal.

2558
02:17:32,770 --> 02:17:34,950
If this motherfucker had the,

2559
02:17:34,951 --> 02:17:39,951
the access to this entire giant business
that rebuild things after you bought

2560
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:45,640
and he was the guy running it. Yeah.
And then he gives them contracts.

2561
02:17:45,670 --> 02:17:47,860
No bid contracts for billions
and billions of dollars.

2562
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:51,520
Dan is so blatant and in your face,
it's so crazy. It's kind of like,

2563
02:17:51,521 --> 02:17:52,840
it's like what are you going
to do about it? You know,

2564
02:17:53,140 --> 02:17:56,320
the media is not going to cover it all
that much and we know you're not going to

2565
02:17:56,321 --> 02:17:58,000
protest because he might get
the shit kicked out of you.

2566
02:17:58,270 --> 02:18:00,730
So what are you gonna do about it?
We're just gonna do it anyway. Shit.

2567
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:04,090
That's totally an American. Yeah,
that's totally UNAMERICAN. Does anybody,

2568
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:07,810
does Alpha brain make you curse more?
Just being

2569
02:18:07,970 --> 02:18:12,320
here with us the other day I saw the
creepiest thing ever in Burbank and I

2570
02:18:12,530 --> 02:18:15,350
immediately raised a really the creepiest
thing ever. You want to clarify that?

2571
02:18:15,380 --> 02:18:18,050
It was pretty creepy and then
I found a video of it. Yeah.

2572
02:18:18,051 --> 02:18:21,650
I've been like searching to see if
anyone else saw it. What was that?

2573
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:23,090
Check this out,
but just tell me what it was.

2574
02:18:23,180 --> 02:18:28,160
It's a tons of tanks is going
through on the train track.

2575
02:18:28,580 --> 02:18:32,400
Oh my readers,
my readers have sent me that stuff.

2576
02:18:32,430 --> 02:18:36,090
Different videos from different parts
of the country. Yeah. It's creepy.

2577
02:18:36,900 --> 02:18:38,910
It could totally be like just the normal,
uh,

2578
02:18:38,970 --> 02:18:41,460
it's coming off of a factory line
has to be shipped somewhere else.

2579
02:18:41,820 --> 02:18:44,340
You were going to send me something
like cats, butthole or something.

2580
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:47,820
But isn't it weird that we're now at
the point where our government really is

2581
02:18:47,821 --> 02:18:51,630
doing so many terrible things that we
see tanks and our first thought is,

2582
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:54,000
are they going to use these against us?
Can you imagine that?

2583
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:56,940
Can you imagine a World War II? Like
you see a line of tanks? You'd be like,

2584
02:18:56,941 --> 02:19:00,360
hell yeah. You won't be like, I
hope they don't use this against us.

2585
02:19:00,750 --> 02:19:03,660
The real problem is when they
don't need drivers. Yeah.

2586
02:19:04,250 --> 02:19:07,170
And when you get us the real
problem [inaudible] man drowns.

2587
02:19:07,400 --> 02:19:10,410
When you have a few people running
these fucking things by remote control,

2588
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:12,930
they can, they can take over
cities and do a lot of shit.

2589
02:19:12,930 --> 02:19:17,190
That's impossible to do when you don't
have an evil cunt behind the switch.

2590
02:19:17,460 --> 02:19:21,720
But if they just have a few dudes work
in somewhere pushing all the buttons for

2591
02:19:21,721 --> 02:19:25,710
these fucking things, you watched
the new total recall, hell no sun.

2592
02:19:25,711 --> 02:19:29,030
They have the synthetic where they just
turn that thing on and they all go out

2593
02:19:29,031 --> 02:19:32,570
and I think we're going to fuck things
up way before that ever happens.

2594
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:35,960
Hopefully. But this,
this is disturbing man.

2595
02:19:36,110 --> 02:19:39,920
Knowing this is drones and knowing all
the thousands of people that have died

2596
02:19:40,510 --> 02:19:42,660
that were totally innocent
because the drones, no,

2597
02:19:42,661 --> 02:19:45,050
the fact that no one seems to have a
problem with that because we don't know

2598
02:19:45,051 --> 02:19:47,300
those little brown people. We
don't know them. Yeah, I'm not,

2599
02:19:47,301 --> 02:19:50,450
I'm not afraid of the technology. Like
it's the technology is the technology.

2600
02:19:50,451 --> 02:19:53,570
You can never turn it back.
Like drones are now a part of warfare.

2601
02:19:53,570 --> 02:19:54,580
That's the way it goes.
Yeah.

2602
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:58,160
The problem I have is a total lack of
accountability. Who are these people?

2603
02:19:58,340 --> 02:19:59,360
Why are they being targeted?

2604
02:19:59,590 --> 02:20:02,390
Did they deserve to be killed or could
they have been detained and questioned?

2605
02:20:02,660 --> 02:20:03,820
Not only that,
given a trial,

2606
02:20:03,830 --> 02:20:07,340
these people that are deciding who to go
after and who not to go after and what

2607
02:20:07,341 --> 02:20:10,580
is your motivation and what ties
do you have to have the burden,

2608
02:20:10,581 --> 02:20:14,450
what times do you have to, how much
money, how much money do you make?

2609
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:16,520
One of those missiles goes off somebody,
you know,

2610
02:20:16,820 --> 02:20:19,190
what does a contract for a
hundred new missiles worth?

2611
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:23,510
Is it worth a lot because it seems like
a good motivation to invade someplace

2612
02:20:23,511 --> 02:20:26,390
where there's nobody paying
attention to anyways, fuck him up.

2613
02:20:26,391 --> 02:20:29,780
Just fucking get rid of some missiles.
It's crazy.

2614
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:32,480
It's crazy that people could
try to make money doing that,

2615
02:20:32,481 --> 02:20:36,320
but there's so much money in doing that.
You have to consider it.

2616
02:20:36,350 --> 02:20:39,380
Look at Afghanistan, it's like, uh,
I was talking to somebody about this.

2617
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:41,480
Our whole policy is like,
okay,

2618
02:20:41,481 --> 02:20:45,680
we can send them some school supplies
and occupied their country with our

2619
02:20:45,681 --> 02:20:48,440
military forces for a few years and
then they're going to have democracy.

2620
02:20:48,441 --> 02:20:51,950
It's just going to spring up because
those people are like literally a thousand

2621
02:20:51,950 --> 02:20:55,340
years behind where we are literally like,
it's like the,

2622
02:20:55,341 --> 02:20:58,160
it's like tattoo in and star wars.
Like they're not there yet.

2623
02:20:58,190 --> 02:21:00,320
There are certain bridges
that need to be built.

2624
02:21:00,470 --> 02:21:05,420
You don't just go from like localized
warlords and this creepy desert that has

2625
02:21:05,421 --> 02:21:09,320
like insane looking spiders. Actually
that's an Iraq. They have camel spiders.

2626
02:21:09,330 --> 02:21:13,120
They're fed people. Those on
fear factor. Yeah, that's,

2627
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,090
I don't like the idea
that they eat him alive.

2628
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:19,400
Camel spiders should be eating people,
not the other way around.

2629
02:21:19,610 --> 02:21:22,430
They're creepy looking alien bugs.
They were gigantic.

2630
02:21:22,431 --> 02:21:25,610
They would fit right in starship
troopers. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway,

2631
02:21:25,611 --> 02:21:29,150
like that part of the world is
not ready for like three years.

2632
02:21:29,151 --> 02:21:33,650
Going from localized warlords to
functioning democracy. We can pull out,

2633
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:37,640
we're done. It's just an to happen.
How far behind it really, truly is.

2634
02:21:37,910 --> 02:21:39,710
I remember McCain referring it to it.

2635
02:21:40,070 --> 02:21:42,350
Mccain was debating Obama
and he was saying like,

2636
02:21:42,351 --> 02:21:45,260
he doesn't understand what he's talking
about when you're talking about invading

2637
02:21:45,261 --> 02:21:50,000
Afghanistan. Afghanistan has
run the same way it was when,

2638
02:21:50,001 --> 02:21:53,350
you know the people who were on horseback,
it was like Alexander the Great, yeah,

2639
02:21:53,351 --> 02:21:55,010
yeah. I just saw a headline today. Uh,

2640
02:21:55,370 --> 02:21:59,960
the Taliban beheaded a bunch of people
and their crime was going to a party that

2641
02:21:59,961 --> 02:22:00,830
was mixed sex.

2642
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:04,490
So there are men and women listening to
music together and drinking together.

2643
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:08,990
Boom. I mean, oh my God,
that's how far behind they are.

2644
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:11,990
They are so willing to take it
to the next level like that.

2645
02:22:12,020 --> 02:22:13,670
That is how you really control people.

2646
02:22:13,870 --> 02:22:17,390
I mean that you chop their fucking heads
off in the middle of the streets and

2647
02:22:17,391 --> 02:22:21,650
nobody does shit. And what does
that do? It creates a, yeah,

2648
02:22:21,651 --> 02:22:25,010
it chills that, that's not gonna
happen again. But we know that that's,

2649
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:26,040
and that's what's

2650
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:27,540
really disturbing about human nature.

2651
02:22:27,570 --> 02:22:32,550
And then in 2012 we have direct evidence
that people who are in positions of

2652
02:22:32,551 --> 02:22:35,940
power are capable of doing
something that fucked up.

2653
02:22:35,941 --> 02:22:38,610
And if you really believe
that people are all the same,

2654
02:22:38,611 --> 02:22:41,670
the only differences we have different
cultures and different environments and

2655
02:22:41,671 --> 02:22:46,620
different biological, you know,
makeups and different ways we look.

2656
02:22:46,621 --> 02:22:48,870
But essentially people are equal.
Well,

2657
02:22:48,871 --> 02:22:52,980
in 2012 people are cutting
people's heads off for nonsense.

2658
02:22:53,100 --> 02:22:56,490
That's what people in
power are capable of doing.

2659
02:22:56,850 --> 02:23:01,020
And we've got a look honestly and
realistically about the people that are in

2660
02:23:01,021 --> 02:23:01,771
power right here.

2661
02:23:01,771 --> 02:23:06,450
Because just because you could drive a
Saab and go to Starbucks and get Wifi at

2662
02:23:06,451 --> 02:23:11,430
work, just because all that's going on
doesn't mean you're not living in a den of

2663
02:23:11,431 --> 02:23:14,940
monster. And not only that, just
because you have those good things,

2664
02:23:14,941 --> 02:23:19,440
you have a safe town and you have
Starbucks and like a level of prosperity

2665
02:23:19,441 --> 02:23:22,550
that's really pretty good. You don't
wanna let that go. It's awesome. Yeah.

2666
02:23:22,551 --> 02:23:26,010
And addressing all the bad stuff that's
happening isn't going to take that away

2667
02:23:26,011 --> 02:23:26,341
from you.

2668
02:23:26,341 --> 02:23:29,940
It'll actually give you more of it because
it's less money will be going to this

2669
02:23:29,941 --> 02:23:30,360
bullshit.

2670
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:33,420
More money will be going into programs
that will keep your town safe and clean.

2671
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:34,770
When we think about America,

2672
02:23:34,771 --> 02:23:38,700
we think about all the good things about
America and not only will none of that

2673
02:23:38,701 --> 02:23:39,360
change,

2674
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:44,160
it will all be enhanced because that more
people will be providing more positive

2675
02:23:44,161 --> 02:23:48,120
things into the city instead of our
cities and our countries and our states

2676
02:23:48,270 --> 02:23:53,270
being governed by this giant fucking
monster that goes overseas and blow shit

2677
02:23:54,421 --> 02:23:57,420
up. Instead of that, all of the tax money,

2678
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:00,360
all of the resources go to building shit,

2679
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:05,070
go to building shit within here,
this country making this place better,

2680
02:24:05,190 --> 02:24:08,280
cleaning up all the bullshit that all
these fucking corporations have left

2681
02:24:08,281 --> 02:24:12,870
behind in terms of toxic waste poisoning
and figure out how to manage nuclear

2682
02:24:12,871 --> 02:24:17,871
waste to fix all of it here though all
of it to this nonsense where the our,

2683
02:24:18,521 --> 02:24:22,860
our whole economy is based
on fucking people out of
their shit and another place.

2684
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:26,700
That's craziness.
It's maybe you should run also fuck fan.

2685
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:30,840
I would love to hear like a Mitt Romney
or somebody say basically that we need

2686
02:24:30,841 --> 02:24:33,660
to then I need to end outsourcing.
We bring these jobs home.

2687
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:37,650
I will never be a part of this system
because this system is bullshit to me.

2688
02:24:37,830 --> 02:24:38,970
This system is like,

2689
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:42,600
you might as well go to the rocky horror
picture show and pretend because you're

2690
02:24:42,601 --> 02:24:45,390
singing along that you're actually in
the movie because you're not really

2691
02:24:45,391 --> 02:24:48,180
changing what's going to happen.
You're, you're not really a part of it.

2692
02:24:48,181 --> 02:24:48,810
You're not.

2693
02:24:48,810 --> 02:24:53,810
It's this system is completely fucked
sideways with corruption and to for you to

2694
02:24:53,971 --> 02:24:58,700
jump in and try to right the ship from the
inside. But man, good luck to you. I'm,

2695
02:24:58,701 --> 02:24:59,880
I'm in your corner,
Dude.

2696
02:24:59,881 --> 02:25:02,720
You're going to try to do it and you're
going to run for Congress and I, I'm,

2697
02:25:02,721 --> 02:25:05,610
I'm wanting to support you and I want
you to win and I want you to get into the

2698
02:25:05,611 --> 02:25:09,450
positions where you can actually make
some change, but to, in order to do that,

2699
02:25:09,451 --> 02:25:11,910
man,
that has to be literally your whole life.

2700
02:25:11,910 --> 02:25:15,390
That has to be your whole life just
to correct the work of some clients.

2701
02:25:15,690 --> 02:25:18,500
Instead of telling the
cons to stop being cuts,

2702
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:21,090
just just get your own shit together.

2703
02:25:21,210 --> 02:25:24,220
The people that are in the
upper positions of power,

2704
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:26,950
that must be fucking creepy,

2705
02:25:26,951 --> 02:25:31,810
paranoid and depressed and weirded out
and on Colona Pan and all kinds of other

2706
02:25:31,811 --> 02:25:36,520
cooking weird drugs to get you through
your day and Xanax and Ambien to go to

2707
02:25:36,521 --> 02:25:37,480
sleep at night.

2708
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:41,470
Do you know how many successful wealthy
people in business I know that are

2709
02:25:41,471 --> 02:25:42,580
addicted to Ambien?

2710
02:25:42,950 --> 02:25:46,270
They're popping that shit every night
to try to get some sleep because they

2711
02:25:46,271 --> 02:25:50,740
can't because they're crazy because
they're dealing with all kinds of nonsense

2712
02:25:50,741 --> 02:25:55,120
all day and fuckery a foot
every step of the way, and they,

2713
02:25:55,121 --> 02:25:58,330
they literally can't even fucking sleep.
They can't relax.

2714
02:25:58,540 --> 02:26:01,150
And everybody goes through this
existential crisis where you're like,

2715
02:26:01,151 --> 02:26:03,490
what the fuck is this all about?
But there's no answer.

2716
02:26:03,491 --> 02:26:05,740
So you'd go buy new Jaguar,
there's no answer.

2717
02:26:05,741 --> 02:26:08,530
So you get a new membership to
the country club and now you're,

2718
02:26:08,531 --> 02:26:10,310
now you're living behind the
coming. Oh. I was like, no,

2719
02:26:10,320 --> 02:26:13,210
it's great in your mood or
Bob and you just keep pushing.

2720
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:16,880
I think a lot of it's a proxy for
not getting sex too. Yeah. Fuck yeah.

2721
02:26:16,990 --> 02:26:21,990
A lot of these dudes in the senator
just old and like pro despite hurt me,

2722
02:26:22,030 --> 02:26:24,750
but probably can't get it up anymore.
Actually. They could probably get it up,

2723
02:26:24,790 --> 02:26:25,890
but now if I add,

2724
02:26:26,220 --> 02:26:30,220
but point is they're not what they used
to be and instead of pulling all these

2725
02:26:30,221 --> 02:26:33,550
girls they used to pull,
they have to feel so of veer,

2726
02:26:34,030 --> 02:26:38,800
veer aisle by passing this shit. That is
ridiculous. Like just totalitarian stuff.

2727
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:42,280
I think a small part of it is like if
you're getting sex regularly and you have

2728
02:26:42,281 --> 02:26:47,281
a balanced life that also involves like
friends and family and doing stuff that

2729
02:26:47,471 --> 02:26:50,590
has nothing to do with politics or with
building drones or any of that stuff,

2730
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:53,290
why would you even be in favor of
these things? You're not going to be,

2731
02:26:54,070 --> 02:26:57,160
you're not going to be in that direction
of let's start a war to make some money

2732
02:26:57,161 --> 02:26:59,890
or let's take away rights just
to be on the safe side. You know?

2733
02:27:00,190 --> 02:27:01,210
You're not going to think that way.

2734
02:27:01,390 --> 02:27:02,920
Yeah,
that's a very good point as well.

2735
02:27:02,921 --> 02:27:07,790
If you're operating from a position of
comfort and power and empowerment, you're,

2736
02:27:07,800 --> 02:27:08,021
you're,

2737
02:27:08,021 --> 02:27:11,200
you feel yourself that you're doing
what you should be doing and you're very

2738
02:27:11,201 --> 02:27:14,170
confident about everything. You're not
going to try to suppress or other people.

2739
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:15,820
And that's the problem
with the old people.

2740
02:27:15,940 --> 02:27:18,730
A lot of old people want to suppress
young people. It's very common.

2741
02:27:18,731 --> 02:27:21,010
They see people coming up and
they shit on them. You know,

2742
02:27:21,011 --> 02:27:24,640
I remember that from the, the comedy
days, you know, the, the older comedians,

2743
02:27:24,641 --> 02:27:26,380
there was two types of older comedians.

2744
02:27:26,530 --> 02:27:30,070
There was a really cool encouraging guys
who would uh, you know, tell you, hey,

2745
02:27:30,071 --> 02:27:31,360
you got to write more.
You know,

2746
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:35,260
you should like go to his much on stage
as you can get the better and give you

2747
02:27:35,261 --> 02:27:37,930
good advice and good luck man. If
you ever have questions, I'm here.

2748
02:27:37,930 --> 02:27:40,970
And those guys are great. You
know those guys like they, they,

2749
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,970
you meet a guy like that,
that like a life raft.

2750
02:27:42,971 --> 02:27:45,610
But then there's other guys that just
see coming up and they just want to push

2751
02:27:45,611 --> 02:27:49,360
it down and shit on you. We want to hold
you in place and they act like they can.

2752
02:27:49,361 --> 02:27:52,070
This guy, I don't want them working
with me. He says, fuck too much.

2753
02:27:52,071 --> 02:27:56,380
She breaks the fuck meter. Like why
you creepy Dick then? But that's a,

2754
02:27:56,381 --> 02:27:58,780
that's the same.
It's just crabs in a bucket.

2755
02:27:58,781 --> 02:28:00,300
They're just trying to hold people down.
Yeah.

2756
02:28:00,340 --> 02:28:02,950
And when you get to a position where
you're a guy like that where your guy like

2757
02:28:02,951 --> 02:28:06,100
Newt Gingrich and they go, hey
man, boxers or briefs you go by,

2758
02:28:06,110 --> 02:28:09,430
what kind of idiotic question is that
you think I'm not going to answer.

2759
02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:11,050
What are you stupid?
You know?

2760
02:28:11,051 --> 02:28:14,770
And then he'd just berate some poor kid
who just asked you a cute question about

2761
02:28:14,771 --> 02:28:16,820
your underwear. I think that says
something about your character too.

2762
02:28:16,840 --> 02:28:19,270
So literally it does.
It says something about you being a bully.

2763
02:28:19,450 --> 02:28:22,040
Like Watch your bench.
I'm talking about like boxers or briefs.

2764
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:22,581
Yeah.
But yeah,

2765
02:28:22,581 --> 02:28:26,420
totally like that response to reporter
a Mitt Romney did something similar.

2766
02:28:26,630 --> 02:28:31,400
He was in Colorado and a TV report
or not even like a random person.

2767
02:28:31,410 --> 02:28:35,510
A TV reporter asked him about
something about marijuana policy,

2768
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:39,170
which in a state like Colorado where
it's a big part of their economy is not a

2769
02:28:39,171 --> 02:28:42,860
crazy question and he was like pissed
that it was asked and you know,

2770
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:45,230
didn't want to address
it. No, not only that,

2771
02:28:45,231 --> 02:28:50,231
there's a terrible defining video where
there's a patient who has some sort of

2772
02:28:50,451 --> 02:28:54,350
debilitating disease and
he's in a wheelchair and he
asked Mitt Romney what his

2773
02:28:54,351 --> 02:28:57,920
stances on medical marijuana. It's just
because it helps him. It helps him eat.

2774
02:28:57,921 --> 02:29:00,500
It helps.
It alleviates his pain and symptoms.

2775
02:29:00,501 --> 02:29:03,410
A lot of them he's telling Mitt Romney
that he benefits from this. Well,

2776
02:29:03,411 --> 02:29:06,680
I'm against it. I'm against medical
marijuana. I don't know what to tell Ya.

2777
02:29:06,710 --> 02:29:10,910
I'm against it. Just like no compassion,
no real connection with this person.

2778
02:29:11,150 --> 02:29:14,570
And to me it's such a telling
video of who Mitt Romney really is.

2779
02:29:14,690 --> 02:29:19,690
He is a guy who is willing to play
the role of the puppet to 80 people.

2780
02:29:19,910 --> 02:29:22,790
Never varied from the
v vary from the script.

2781
02:29:22,791 --> 02:29:26,810
He's stuck on the policy line.
It's so scary. It's terrifying.

2782
02:29:26,811 --> 02:29:30,620
It's not a real person. He
said, he doesn't even know
what the fuck he's a Mormon.

2783
02:29:30,621 --> 02:29:35,300
Stop. Just don alone. That that's
a can of worms. It's crazy.

2784
02:29:35,301 --> 02:29:37,580
I can't believe at a 314 million people,

2785
02:29:37,860 --> 02:29:41,930
that's our current population at the best
we can come up with is Obama who has a

2786
02:29:41,931 --> 02:29:46,190
record now of promoting things that the
Bush administration would not have even

2787
02:29:46,191 --> 02:29:46,520
done.

2788
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:50,960
Like there is a former Bush administration
official said that NDA was something

2789
02:29:50,961 --> 02:29:54,890
that their administration would not
have tried and would not have even found

2790
02:29:54,891 --> 02:29:58,700
acceptable. And so you have Obama doing
these things so we know where he stands.

2791
02:29:58,701 --> 02:30:02,630
Let me have Mitt Romney and those are our
two best choices out of all the talent

2792
02:30:02,690 --> 02:30:06,390
and energy in this country. That's what we
were. And the, the answer is, of course,

2793
02:30:06,391 --> 02:30:08,900
those aren't our best choices.
Those are the people who were put forward.

2794
02:30:09,290 --> 02:30:14,240
You know, Mitt Romney, I had no part in
him becoming, uh, you know, our pick,

2795
02:30:14,450 --> 02:30:18,140
most people didn't have a say in that
and it just happened. And I mean,

2796
02:30:18,141 --> 02:30:21,080
there were better choices out there and
they weren't given enough attention.

2797
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:23,080
Well,
the Ron Paul issue was the,

2798
02:30:23,081 --> 02:30:26,690
the greatest issue when you want to talk
about someone who has rallied behind by

2799
02:30:26,691 --> 02:30:29,630
so many different people.
And Ron Paul himself is a,

2800
02:30:29,631 --> 02:30:33,730
a radical Christian and in fact it doesn't
even support the theory of evolution.

2801
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:36,680
It doesn't bother me cause he leaves
it up church, he leaves the church,

2802
02:30:36,710 --> 02:30:39,200
he leaves it there.
When it's influencing policy,

2803
02:30:39,201 --> 02:30:42,290
then I have to look at all the other
and when you want to infringe upon other

2804
02:30:42,291 --> 02:30:45,740
people's rights and yet you believe in
some wackiness that has to be brought

2805
02:30:45,741 --> 02:30:48,980
into the equation now as long as
you keep it to yourself, we're cool.

2806
02:30:49,010 --> 02:30:52,940
As long as you don't fuck with
people. And you really go, by the way,

2807
02:30:52,941 --> 02:30:56,180
this country was initially
founded a separation,

2808
02:30:56,181 --> 02:30:59,720
a true separation of church and state
because people were coming here because

2809
02:30:59,721 --> 02:31:02,390
they face religious persecution in
other lands and they said, listen,

2810
02:31:02,391 --> 02:31:05,770
let's just work it out. So we keep that
shit out of this. Agree. Yep. Yeah.

2811
02:31:05,900 --> 02:31:07,190
Founded our founding documents.

2812
02:31:07,191 --> 02:31:09,620
We're still beautiful like the
bill and the bill of rights.

2813
02:31:09,621 --> 02:31:14,270
Like now you see contracts like the terms
of use on iTunes or whatever and it's

2814
02:31:14,271 --> 02:31:15,950
like difficult to get
through cause it's so long.

2815
02:31:16,220 --> 02:31:19,740
The bill of rights threatened so you
could be like a 15 year and understand it

2816
02:31:19,741 --> 02:31:21,480
perfectly with no legal background.

2817
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:25,320
So simple like you have a right to the
freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.

2818
02:31:25,470 --> 02:31:26,910
Now these are rights.
You have them,

2819
02:31:26,911 --> 02:31:29,160
we're not going to bury it
and some kind of legal lees.

2820
02:31:29,750 --> 02:31:33,510
The the the only problem that I
ever have with someone who is in a,

2821
02:31:33,990 --> 02:31:36,810
we call it a cult or a religion
or anything like that, like,

2822
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:39,120
like being a Mormon is that
you're so committed to it.

2823
02:31:39,121 --> 02:31:42,000
It's not that I don't think Mormonism
can help you and make you a better person

2824
02:31:42,001 --> 02:31:44,610
because like I said, I know they're
really nice people that are Mormons.

2825
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:49,590
It's just if you're willing to believe
that, what else do you believe? Right?

2826
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:52,200
What else? What do, how much is
that going to affect your choices?

2827
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:56,070
What kind of weird apocalyptic shit
should somebody put into your head?

2828
02:31:56,071 --> 02:32:01,071
If you really truly do believe that a
14 year old boy from 1820 found golden

2829
02:32:01,861 --> 02:32:06,510
tablets that contain the loss work of
Jesus and that the American Indians were

2830
02:32:06,511 --> 02:32:09,430
actually a tribe that came
here from Israel. Right.

2831
02:32:09,431 --> 02:32:12,000
And the other original Israelites,
like not a lot of,

2832
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:14,260
not a lot of evidence for that.
Well,

2833
02:32:14,310 --> 02:32:16,920
not a lot of 14 year old kids
in are completely full of shit.

2834
02:32:16,921 --> 02:32:20,790
And once I start talking about angels
dropping off packages of gold and then

2835
02:32:20,791 --> 02:32:23,880
taking them away before the people could
come and read them and they had a magic

2836
02:32:23,881 --> 02:32:27,110
stones to look at them with like
this isn't even well-written. Yeah.

2837
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:30,270
It's like this is crazy if that,
if someone had tried to say that today,

2838
02:32:30,300 --> 02:32:32,670
there's no way he would listen to them.
If a guy came to me today and said,

2839
02:32:32,671 --> 02:32:35,230
listen, maybe the definition
of craziness exactly you would,

2840
02:32:35,550 --> 02:32:38,480
but because it's old people go,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2841
02:32:38,490 --> 02:32:42,990
But back then it was real. If it happened
today, what would you do? You would say,

2842
02:32:42,991 --> 02:32:43,111
well,

2843
02:32:43,111 --> 02:32:46,350
there's 14 year old kid is obviously full
of shit on the miracles in the Bible.

2844
02:32:46,351 --> 02:32:47,730
It's like,
where did all this stuff go?

2845
02:32:47,970 --> 02:32:51,340
Like it happened all the time
back then and now it's like, yeah,

2846
02:32:51,540 --> 02:32:54,720
the real problem with board, the miracles
have happened. By the way, that dude,

2847
02:32:54,721 --> 02:32:58,530
a captain Sally, that was a miracle.
Like that'll probably be in our,

2848
02:32:58,710 --> 02:33:01,320
whatever we have is a bible
like 2000 years from now,

2849
02:33:01,321 --> 02:33:03,720
they'll mention that the skillful,
skillful landing,

2850
02:33:03,721 --> 02:33:07,530
skillful but also a brilliant job kind
of water kind of a miracle. You think so?

2851
02:33:07,770 --> 02:33:11,520
Well and the sense that uh,
you have a plane crash and like,

2852
02:33:12,180 --> 02:33:15,690
uh, like the media covers it in
such a negative way for so long.

2853
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:20,400
And this one was like, just not what
you see. So I think it was a miracle,

2854
02:33:20,401 --> 02:33:23,880
like in the sense that, uh, maybe
it was just a skillful landing.

2855
02:33:23,881 --> 02:33:27,840
I don't know what the odds are, is a
man who became a fucking saved people.

2856
02:33:27,841 --> 02:33:29,610
He manned up,
he did what?

2857
02:33:29,611 --> 02:33:33,240
He's an expert pilot and he did what
he was trained to do in that situation.

2858
02:33:33,241 --> 02:33:36,270
He did it perfectly and he handled
himself under pressure in heroic fashion.

2859
02:33:36,570 --> 02:33:37,950
I don't think you should
say that's a miracle.

2860
02:33:37,951 --> 02:33:40,410
I think that's a man with
character that should be admired.

2861
02:33:40,411 --> 02:33:42,150
I don't think there's
anything miraculous about it.

2862
02:33:42,151 --> 02:33:45,620
I think it was training and long,
long hours in the job and, and, and,

2863
02:33:45,621 --> 02:33:48,420
and the expert ability
to handle an airplane.

2864
02:33:48,690 --> 02:33:51,150
And he just did it in a perfect way
where some people would have fucking

2865
02:33:51,151 --> 02:33:53,520
panicked and fell apart and
killed everybody on that plane.

2866
02:33:53,730 --> 02:33:56,830
That's a lot of people. I
Dunno, I'm sticking with
miracle. I think when it gets,

2867
02:33:57,270 --> 02:33:59,730
when it gets a pass down
the line enough times,

2868
02:33:59,731 --> 02:34:03,830
it's going to be that like Jesus's
hands slowly glided that thing down.

2869
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:06,000
It's the water.
It's probably already there.

2870
02:34:06,330 --> 02:34:08,820
Maybe there's someone who was on the
plane who was praying that's taking full

2871
02:34:08,821 --> 02:34:12,820
credit for maybe it was
one of the horrible things
about the Colorado thing was

2872
02:34:12,821 --> 02:34:17,560
the guy who was claiming that the reason
why he was spared and all these other

2873
02:34:17,561 --> 02:34:22,180
people including young children
were killed, is that, uh, he was,

2874
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:26,680
uh, spare to, to let people know
how great God is. Crazy people suck.

2875
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:28,290
They suck man.
As,

2876
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:31,030
and especially when you realize that it's
probably some really cool people that

2877
02:34:31,031 --> 02:34:33,960
got shot and this asshole know,

2878
02:34:34,030 --> 02:34:38,470
thinks that the reason why they got
shot and he didn't is because he was

2879
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:42,550
thinking the right things. And he
was, uh, hoping to God that he could,

2880
02:34:42,580 --> 02:34:44,860
he could spread God's word like,
come on man.

2881
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:48,550
How about you got lucky and it's a shame
that this cunt killed all these people.

2882
02:34:48,551 --> 02:34:49,490
How about that?
Yeah.

2883
02:34:49,630 --> 02:34:52,720
Or like I won the football
game because I prayed to Jesus.

2884
02:34:52,721 --> 02:34:56,170
What about the like millions of people
killed and all these different countries.

2885
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:59,140
It's just sort of were none of
them praying, you know, like,

2886
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:04,200
and yet the did the outcome of your
football match is being divinely decided,

2887
02:35:04,511 --> 02:35:07,750
you know, it's so creepy that
that doesn't drive everyone nuts.

2888
02:35:08,170 --> 02:35:11,560
It's so Korean kind of how I kind of
hope for uh, sorry to cut you off.

2889
02:35:11,561 --> 02:35:15,520
I kind of hope for like some kind of alien
invasion, not even an alien invasion.

2890
02:35:15,521 --> 02:35:20,350
Just I hope that one day NASA comes out
and says, by the way, they're aliens.

2891
02:35:20,351 --> 02:35:21,670
Like they might come here,
they might not,

2892
02:35:21,671 --> 02:35:25,000
but we found out their alien somewhere
and they had been monitoring us.

2893
02:35:25,001 --> 02:35:27,070
Everything we do,
just the fact they're aliens,

2894
02:35:27,071 --> 02:35:30,310
then it's like we all have to come
together as a people because we're now one

2895
02:35:30,311 --> 02:35:34,420
planet and we have to defend against
these other things so we can't get caught

2896
02:35:34,421 --> 02:35:37,840
up in bullshit. Like what is your old
book say versus Mild Book, you know?

2897
02:35:38,500 --> 02:35:41,440
Yeah. We will have to deal with reality
as it actually exists right now.

2898
02:35:41,441 --> 02:35:45,100
What are our resources? How can we defend
ourselves if we can? Exactly. You know,

2899
02:35:45,101 --> 02:35:47,290
the most compelling idea about alien life.

2900
02:35:47,291 --> 02:35:51,280
To me it was an alien that that
alien consciousness is creativity.

2901
02:35:51,630 --> 02:35:55,560
And that it's creating our society by
planting the seed of creativity in the

2902
02:35:55,600 --> 02:35:57,760
modern animal,
the modern monkey animal,

2903
02:35:57,761 --> 02:36:02,170
and forcing it to eventually pursue
it's doom and that they, it has to,

2904
02:36:02,380 --> 02:36:05,140
it is absolutely compelled
to fuck with manner,

2905
02:36:05,141 --> 02:36:08,410
to the point where it seals its own
doom. Wow. And then it's like a,

2906
02:36:08,411 --> 02:36:11,800
a builtin program in us.
And that it's a design.

2907
02:36:11,801 --> 02:36:14,000
That's how you blow up planets.

2908
02:36:14,830 --> 02:36:19,520
That's how you fuck with
planets along method. It just
inject creativity and, and,

2909
02:36:19,521 --> 02:36:23,950
and, and uh, the need for constant
innovation, bigger, better things.

2910
02:36:24,150 --> 02:36:27,130
And eventually they just blow the whole
thing sky high. It's an inevitable,

2911
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:30,730
it's an unavoidable, awful and beautiful
at the same time. Well, I mean it's,

2912
02:36:30,731 --> 02:36:34,150
it all comes from our desire to
understand our surroundings better and our

2913
02:36:34,151 --> 02:36:35,980
desire to improve.
But why is that?

2914
02:36:35,981 --> 02:36:39,250
If we ultimately are temporary being shit
and we stop at a certain point and say,

2915
02:36:39,251 --> 02:36:44,251
all we need is food and all we need is
a comfort and let's enjoy our comradery.

2916
02:36:44,351 --> 02:36:46,360
While we're here and get
through this thing in a very,

2917
02:36:46,660 --> 02:36:50,710
very healthy and spiritual way, but
we're like, nope, not interested in that.

2918
02:36:50,740 --> 02:36:55,000
Interested in a bigger fucking TV and
I want some pills and make me sleep at

2919
02:36:55,001 --> 02:36:57,820
night and is there a way I can
get the Internet on my glasses?

2920
02:36:57,910 --> 02:37:00,610
I want to look through my fucking
glasses and read my email.

2921
02:37:00,611 --> 02:37:02,290
I don't want to ever know
where any direction is.

2922
02:37:02,291 --> 02:37:04,110
I want my car to drive me Google glasses,

2923
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:06,850
I want my phone to have
a million photos of it

2924
02:37:07,230 --> 02:37:08,063
on it.

2925
02:37:09,030 --> 02:37:14,030
We were in some weird weird cycle
where it's like you've seen runner,

2926
02:37:15,351 --> 02:37:16,160
right?
Yeah.

2927
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:20,810
So there are program. Tony lived for
four years, then they die. So they know.

2928
02:37:21,170 --> 02:37:22,130
I mean,
they're upset about that,

2929
02:37:22,131 --> 02:37:25,760
but also it forces you to be in
the present and that's what we are.

2930
02:37:25,761 --> 02:37:26,310
You don't know.

2931
02:37:26,310 --> 02:37:29,540
You're not going to be dead within
four years or what's the difference?

2932
02:37:29,541 --> 02:37:32,550
What's the difference between four
years or 40 years, you know? Right.

2933
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:36,470
You're going to be dead soon and you have
these memories in your past that have

2934
02:37:36,471 --> 02:37:39,050
been implanted in a sense.
Like, I mean you've had,

2935
02:37:39,080 --> 02:37:40,430
you have real memories
of what you've done,

2936
02:37:40,431 --> 02:37:44,420
but at the end of the day it's all your
perception was that like the memory is

2937
02:37:44,421 --> 02:37:47,960
kind of like this false,
it's take this false security like okay,

2938
02:37:47,961 --> 02:37:51,080
I've done a lot of cool shit in the past
so I can just ride for a little while

2939
02:37:51,081 --> 02:37:51,914
and not do anything.

2940
02:37:52,130 --> 02:37:54,950
But really you can't do that cause you
don't know how much time you have left.

2941
02:37:55,030 --> 02:37:57,850
Well not only that, then you become
a fat fuck and a loser. Yeah.

2942
02:37:57,900 --> 02:38:00,130
Cause that's what happens to
people when they give up on trying.

2943
02:38:00,160 --> 02:38:03,430
They get fat and they get stupid and
they quit and they just lay around and do

2944
02:38:03,431 --> 02:38:07,000
nothing until they die. That's
someone who's not enjoying
their life. They've lit,

2945
02:38:07,030 --> 02:38:11,650
rested on their laurels. It's
um, it's weird to be temporary.

2946
02:38:12,190 --> 02:38:13,630
So weird feeling.
We don't like it.

2947
02:38:13,810 --> 02:38:16,450
That's why religion exists
exists in the first place.

2948
02:38:16,451 --> 02:38:19,660
It's almost like a scaffolding to
sort of get us through it while we're

2949
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:22,240
constructing some new level
of consciousness. It's like,

2950
02:38:22,270 --> 02:38:24,700
let me just give you some shit to think
about this. What's going to happen.

2951
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:30,040
The the really promising feeling that
you get from psychedelic drugs is that

2952
02:38:30,791 --> 02:38:35,791
what you experience is so stupendously
alien to what you experience on an

2953
02:38:37,150 --> 02:38:41,230
everyday day to day basis that it
gives you hope for some really complex

2954
02:38:41,231 --> 02:38:44,770
structure to the universe
that's unavailable to you
when you're in a straight

2955
02:38:45,100 --> 02:38:48,100
and normal a form and
state of consciousness.

2956
02:38:48,460 --> 02:38:52,900
And that there might be chemical doorways
to different dimensions and chemical

2957
02:38:52,901 --> 02:38:54,250
doorways to different experiences.

2958
02:38:54,251 --> 02:38:58,180
And that's essentially what your whole
neuro chemistry and your whole life is

2959
02:38:58,181 --> 02:38:59,470
based on your series of chemicals,

2960
02:38:59,471 --> 02:39:02,260
adrenaline when Shit goes wrong
and you need to fight or flight.

2961
02:39:02,500 --> 02:39:05,690
You know Sarah Tonin when
you have babies and delve,

2962
02:39:05,700 --> 02:39:09,070
I mean when you see people that you love
and you'd go outside and it's sunny and

2963
02:39:09,071 --> 02:39:09,550
I mean there's a,

2964
02:39:09,550 --> 02:39:13,120
there's all sorts of chemical releases
that are constantly going on that bring

2965
02:39:13,121 --> 02:39:14,860
you to altered states of consciousness.

2966
02:39:15,430 --> 02:39:19,150
And we know that the brain produces
some very extreme psychedelic chemicals.

2967
02:39:19,450 --> 02:39:22,210
So it just stands to
reason to me that this,

2968
02:39:22,390 --> 02:39:25,990
this idea that the only thing that's
real is some shit that you can touch with

2969
02:39:25,991 --> 02:39:26,561
your hands.

2970
02:39:26,561 --> 02:39:29,890
And that this dimension and this
experience is the only thing that's real

2971
02:39:29,891 --> 02:39:33,990
because it's what we're conscious of and
what we're involved in right now. I say,

2972
02:39:34,090 --> 02:39:35,320
I say no fucking way.

2973
02:39:35,350 --> 02:39:39,520
I say it's much more likely that this
thing is way more complicated than we can

2974
02:39:39,521 --> 02:39:40,271
even imagine.

2975
02:39:40,271 --> 02:39:43,990
And that we are silly little ants
walking around on a dog's ass trying to

2976
02:39:43,991 --> 02:39:44,980
describe the universe.

2977
02:39:45,500 --> 02:39:47,870
Of course it would be much better
if I didn't fuck up that last word.

2978
02:39:47,930 --> 02:39:51,140
I think it's weird that
like old societies, uh,

2979
02:39:51,380 --> 02:39:56,380
the people that they look to for advice
and for counsel or like Shamans who knew

2980
02:39:56,421 --> 02:39:59,120
the most about taking
these kinds of journeys.

2981
02:39:59,420 --> 02:40:01,070
And also they had an ancient Greece.

2982
02:40:01,071 --> 02:40:04,310
They supposedly had the oracle and
they were, from what I understand,

2983
02:40:04,311 --> 02:40:07,010
under the influence of some
kind of psychedelic drug,

2984
02:40:07,011 --> 02:40:09,950
which helped them come up with
their prophecies or whatever. Uh,

2985
02:40:09,951 --> 02:40:12,610
so this is where people look
to and today our leaders,

2986
02:40:12,630 --> 02:40:14,040
the people who know the least about these

2987
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:18,060
things, like a guy like Paul Ryan
and claims that he's never smoked,

2988
02:40:18,480 --> 02:40:21,020
never smoked pot. He says that's what
somebody, somebody sent me a link to it.

2989
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:24,240
It didn't read the whole article,
but I think you said it was in Gq.

2990
02:40:24,390 --> 02:40:28,080
He claims he's never smoked pot.
He's a silly bitch. If that's true.

2991
02:40:28,110 --> 02:40:30,630
It's one of two things, right? We
were talking about us before the show.

2992
02:40:30,660 --> 02:40:34,470
Either he's a Dork and you don't want
him to be president either he's a liar,

2993
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:39,090
he's a tool or he's a liar. Yeah.
Most people have either thought about,

2994
02:40:39,091 --> 02:40:43,110
well I know actually I should say that
I know a lot of people that haven't

2995
02:40:43,140 --> 02:40:48,060
because they grew up with families where
the father had a problem or the mother

2996
02:40:48,061 --> 02:40:50,770
had a problem or both.
I have seen that and uh,

2997
02:40:50,771 --> 02:40:55,771
I've seen people who have become very
successful and are adamant against any

2998
02:40:56,221 --> 02:40:58,650
form of drug.
They have never had a drop of alcohol,

2999
02:40:58,750 --> 02:40:59,880
they have never had marijuana.

3000
02:40:59,881 --> 02:41:03,690
And I respect them greatly for that choice
because what that choice is for them

3001
02:41:03,691 --> 02:41:07,710
is that they don't want to go down the
path that they have seen their own loved

3002
02:41:07,711 --> 02:41:10,860
ones go down. So those things
are the enemy, those substances,

3003
02:41:10,861 --> 02:41:13,650
although maybe they can handle it
and maybe they couldn't get to them,

3004
02:41:13,651 --> 02:41:15,770
those substances are weak
and those are the right.

3005
02:41:16,010 --> 02:41:18,480
Well those are the respect that those
are like some of the guys who run these

3006
02:41:18,481 --> 02:41:21,150
rehab centers,
they were once alcoholics,

3007
02:41:21,151 --> 02:41:23,940
so they were once drug addicts and
they had the worst experience possible.

3008
02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:26,580
So then they're like, I don't want
anybody else to go through this.

3009
02:41:26,880 --> 02:41:28,920
Maybe some people can handle it
better than you did. You know,

3010
02:41:28,921 --> 02:41:30,330
just cause you fucked up your life.

3011
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:33,270
So important doesn't mean that nobody
else can enjoy like a couple of beers and

3012
02:41:33,271 --> 02:41:35,820
they're out on a date or like out of
fundraiser or something, you know?

3013
02:41:35,860 --> 02:41:38,730
I mean there's people that
can't handle anything.

3014
02:41:38,731 --> 02:41:42,420
They can't handle any social situation.
They stammer, they fucking panic.

3015
02:41:42,570 --> 02:41:44,220
Their character shows,
you know,

3016
02:41:44,250 --> 02:41:46,770
people's character can show
in psychedelic experiences,

3017
02:41:46,771 --> 02:41:50,070
just like you can show in a social
experience. You know, there's, um,

3018
02:41:50,100 --> 02:41:54,390
one of the things that happens when
someone is first learning. Jujitsu is a,

3019
02:41:54,420 --> 02:41:56,040
the first time you get tapped.

3020
02:41:56,240 --> 02:41:59,730
It's a very humiliating feeling
when you have to give up. It's very,

3021
02:41:59,740 --> 02:42:01,130
it made you feel angry.

3022
02:42:01,260 --> 02:42:06,260
It feels very personal and it takes a
very strong person to get through that.

3023
02:42:07,471 --> 02:42:10,500
And it's just the very beginning of
Jujitsu, which is the hardest part.

3024
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:13,500
When you get tapped, what does that mean?
Like the guy you have doubt give up. No,

3025
02:42:13,501 --> 02:42:16,720
no, no. The, Oh, you and
apoe coal or an arm bar.

3026
02:42:16,770 --> 02:42:18,960
Physically tap the path
to let them know you quit.

3027
02:42:19,020 --> 02:42:21,180
You quit because they're
going to kill you. You,

3028
02:42:21,280 --> 02:42:24,060
if the guy has your back and he's
choking you and you're tapping,

3029
02:42:24,090 --> 02:42:27,030
you're essentially admitting that he's
about to put you unconscious with that

3030
02:42:27,031 --> 02:42:30,060
choke and you're giving up. So you're
doing the olive garden basically.

3031
02:42:30,330 --> 02:42:32,730
That's not quitting or you doing,
you're doing the olive garden.

3032
02:42:32,731 --> 02:42:37,260
The a seven times it did the
olive garden, the safe word. Oh,

3033
02:42:37,261 --> 02:42:38,094
the say for it.

3034
02:42:38,130 --> 02:42:41,440
That's why I forgot we had admitted that
or we came up with that earlier. No,

3035
02:42:41,441 --> 02:42:43,500
it's the tapping out as the second point.
I understand what you were saying.

3036
02:42:43,501 --> 02:42:46,080
I'm like, is he involved in this
off guard and prank as well? Yeah,

3037
02:42:46,081 --> 02:42:48,270
that's our safe word.
It means that's what you do,

3038
02:42:49,020 --> 02:42:51,780
but it's very emotional for a lot of,
a lot of guys,

3039
02:42:51,990 --> 02:42:54,600
especially when they first start doing it,
it really freaks them out.

3040
02:42:54,601 --> 02:42:55,650
They don't like it at all.

3041
02:42:55,880 --> 02:42:58,770
I've had guys that like the first time
they've ever done Jujitsu and you see

3042
02:42:58,771 --> 02:42:59,670
them hyperventilate,

3043
02:42:59,700 --> 02:43:03,270
like a guy gets on top of them and
then they panic because they think that

3044
02:43:03,271 --> 02:43:06,090
they're about to get God and they've never
had that happen to them before. Right.

3045
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:07,820
Once it happens to a few times,

3046
02:43:07,860 --> 02:43:10,440
once you do it a bunch of times and
then you get used to doing it to other

3047
02:43:10,441 --> 02:43:11,800
people,
then it becomes accepted

3048
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:16,000
normal part of your everyday life and
you're not terrified of the struggle.

3049
02:43:16,210 --> 02:43:19,150
The struggle becomes a straw.
It's just becomes reality.

3050
02:43:19,390 --> 02:43:22,240
It becomes a part of reality instead
of something you're absolutely,

3051
02:43:22,241 --> 02:43:26,530
completely terrified of. So in getting
through that, you develop some character.

3052
02:43:26,680 --> 02:43:30,400
He developed some of the ability to
overcome adversity and you develop the

3053
02:43:30,401 --> 02:43:32,680
ability to overcome very
uncomfortable moments,

3054
02:43:32,890 --> 02:43:34,780
but you don't have to do
it just through Jujitsu.

3055
02:43:34,930 --> 02:43:38,590
You can do that shit through yoga. You
know, Yoga, yoga sounds ridiculous,

3056
02:43:38,591 --> 02:43:41,800
but yoga positions are really
fucking hard to hold, man.

3057
02:43:41,980 --> 02:43:45,970
And if you give up in the middle of the
position, you feel like a bitch, you know,

3058
02:43:45,971 --> 02:43:48,370
you feel like it. All right, I'm going
to go back to it. And then you'll try it.

3059
02:43:48,371 --> 02:43:50,050
Hold it again. But you, you gave up,

3060
02:43:50,080 --> 02:43:53,150
you could have hung in there and
you could have waited until the,

3061
02:43:53,151 --> 02:43:56,250
the lady says next she can do it.
How come you can't do it? Right?

3062
02:43:56,350 --> 02:43:59,740
You can't do it because you haven't
pushed yourself to the position where you

3063
02:43:59,741 --> 02:44:02,740
can do it. And once you do push
yourself, when then you can do it.

3064
02:44:02,741 --> 02:44:05,800
Then you have this wave of
accomplishment and it's feeling and this

3065
02:44:05,801 --> 02:44:08,680
understanding like, oh,
it's difficult to do shit.

3066
02:44:08,950 --> 02:44:11,920
Like everything doesn't come easy and
the thing that companies, they come easy,

3067
02:44:11,921 --> 02:44:14,260
they aren't, they aren't shit.
The things that you really enjoy,

3068
02:44:14,261 --> 02:44:18,040
the things that are really fucking hard
to do and unfortunately we have a lot of

3069
02:44:18,041 --> 02:44:21,760
people that are running shit that
don't have control of their character.

3070
02:44:21,761 --> 02:44:24,880
They have not done difficult things.
They have not tested their ego.

3071
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:28,270
They have not broken there will,
they have not been broken and training.

3072
02:44:28,450 --> 02:44:30,970
They have not developed a real character.

3073
02:44:30,971 --> 02:44:35,971
What they've developed is a sort of a
fake personality that they have devised

3074
02:44:36,761 --> 02:44:39,220
that society wants and will accept.

3075
02:44:39,430 --> 02:44:42,880
So they're saying all the right things
because those right things make people

3076
02:44:42,881 --> 02:44:44,200
think I like you Mike.

3077
02:44:44,380 --> 02:44:48,640
You're a good Christian and you hold
that milk like a 1950s commercial.

3078
02:44:48,970 --> 02:44:52,240
You know what I mean? They
become something that think
people would like to hear.

3079
02:44:52,690 --> 02:44:57,690
We need an economy where a man gets
credit for starting his own business.

3080
02:44:58,060 --> 02:44:59,500
You did build it yourself.

3081
02:44:59,970 --> 02:45:04,740
I mean built your minimum wage job
all by herself. Is that guy, what is,

3082
02:45:04,960 --> 02:45:08,230
what is he doing?
Is he being dizzy or aware of who he is?

3083
02:45:08,350 --> 02:45:12,370
Because I don't really think you can
be aware of who you are unless you have

3084
02:45:12,371 --> 02:45:14,800
some form of a transcendent experience.

3085
02:45:14,980 --> 02:45:18,420
That transcendent experience could be a
fucking vision quest where you hike to

3086
02:45:18,421 --> 02:45:22,330
the top of Mount Everest or
death experiences. A lot of
people change after that.

3087
02:45:22,331 --> 02:45:24,880
They're like, oh this shit, this shit
really doesn't matter. They certainly do.

3088
02:45:24,881 --> 02:45:27,600
They certainly do perspective wise.
And they also do because the,

3089
02:45:27,601 --> 02:45:30,850
the release of endogenous psychedelic
chemicals that happen in the near death

3090
02:45:30,851 --> 02:45:31,630
experience,

3091
02:45:31,630 --> 02:45:35,080
people in near death experiences have
some really fucking vivid hallucinations

3092
02:45:35,320 --> 02:45:37,660
that um, by the way, a mirror,

3093
02:45:37,661 --> 02:45:40,660
the ones where they've injected
people with dimethyltryptamine,

3094
02:45:40,661 --> 02:45:42,880
which is a chemical that your brain
produces when you're dreaming.

3095
02:45:43,270 --> 02:45:46,840
So they've injected people
with dimethyltryptamine and
they have also have these

3096
02:45:46,841 --> 02:45:51,190
intense psychedelic experiences that
were very similar to the experiences of

3097
02:45:51,191 --> 02:45:54,190
people that people had during
near death experiences.

3098
02:45:54,191 --> 02:45:56,820
What people saw the bright light and
they went through the tunnel and they cut

3099
02:45:56,830 --> 02:46:01,830
to another side and all of
that shit mirrors and mimics
the experiences that our

3100
02:46:02,111 --> 02:46:06,640
rep, you could replicate them
with psychedelic chemicals
that the brain makes.

3101
02:46:07,090 --> 02:46:09,950
So all of it to that.

3102
02:46:09,951 --> 02:46:13,460
There's a lot of different things that
can happen to a person where they get a

3103
02:46:13,461 --> 02:46:15,800
fresh perspective and in
near death experiences.

3104
02:46:15,800 --> 02:46:18,590
One of them for a variety of reasons,
just so you know, perspective,

3105
02:46:18,591 --> 02:46:21,500
the fact that it was almost over,
man, maybe I need to rethink my life.

3106
02:46:21,740 --> 02:46:24,140
Not even just for the, the high
that you get from those chemicals,

3107
02:46:24,141 --> 02:46:26,690
flooding your brain, but both,
both, both of them together.

3108
02:46:27,110 --> 02:46:30,530
But I think you need to do something
in life, man. People need a quest.

3109
02:46:30,740 --> 02:46:32,090
They need a vision.
They need,

3110
02:46:32,270 --> 02:46:35,540
they need something that tests their
character and in a way that doesn't hurt

3111
02:46:35,541 --> 02:46:38,900
other people. And if it, you know,
even if you heard, well, you know,

3112
02:46:38,901 --> 02:46:40,850
you mean you heard of the people
through competition. That's,

3113
02:46:41,270 --> 02:46:42,740
that's sort of a voluntary thing.

3114
02:46:42,920 --> 02:46:45,200
And I'll give you engage in
martial arts competition.

3115
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:48,170
You're going to hurt people,
but they're going to hurt you too.

3116
02:46:48,200 --> 02:46:49,610
But you will also grow.

3117
02:46:49,670 --> 02:46:53,090
And then you will also grow from it
because it's so fucking difficult and the

3118
02:46:53,091 --> 02:46:57,590
body can heal and it's worth it as
in terms of what it can do for your

3119
02:46:57,591 --> 02:46:58,130
character.

3120
02:46:58,130 --> 02:47:01,850
Can you develop your character in ways
that are really unavailable for people

3121
02:47:01,851 --> 02:47:02,870
who are not tested?

3122
02:47:03,410 --> 02:47:07,070
And it doesn't mean tested
necessarily tested physically.

3123
02:47:07,290 --> 02:47:09,860
They can be tested mentally.
It can be a meditation thing.

3124
02:47:09,861 --> 02:47:14,360
It could be getting over, you know,
uh, various aspects of, of, of uh,

3125
02:47:14,410 --> 02:47:17,270
understanding of your yourself,
exploring the mind.

3126
02:47:17,540 --> 02:47:18,800
It can be a bunch of different things,

3127
02:47:18,801 --> 02:47:22,670
but you gotta be tested in this fucking
life, like real legitimately tested.

3128
02:47:22,671 --> 02:47:26,540
You can't just jump into a fucking
party of Douche bags that are currently

3129
02:47:26,541 --> 02:47:28,880
running shit and act like
they want you to act.

3130
02:47:29,110 --> 02:47:32,240
Then all of a sudden you're some position
of power and you're some weird Mitt

3131
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:34,340
Romney care probably doesn't
even know who the fuck he is.

3132
02:47:34,420 --> 02:47:35,430
Well,
it sounds how to make money.

3133
02:47:35,440 --> 02:47:39,370
It's like those people who
are like Xda and they're like,

3134
02:47:39,700 --> 02:47:42,340
they come out against drugs and all this
shit and you're like, yeah. Too Bad.

3135
02:47:42,341 --> 02:47:44,810
You weren't able to speak up when
you were actually in that position.

3136
02:47:44,811 --> 02:47:48,400
He come out for drugs and come out
illegal. We against what's happening.

3137
02:47:48,401 --> 02:47:48,971
And then you're like,

3138
02:47:48,971 --> 02:47:51,790
too bad you couldn't say a single word
about that while you were actually in

3139
02:47:51,791 --> 02:47:54,250
that position deciding policy.
You know

3140
02:47:54,880 --> 02:47:56,100
Michael Rupert is a,

3141
02:47:56,101 --> 02:47:58,980
a friend of the show and he's been on
and a couple of times and Michael Rupert

3142
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:03,910
was a cop in the 1980s during
the whole Iran Contra affair,

3143
02:48:04,150 --> 02:48:05,080
went on television,

3144
02:48:05,081 --> 02:48:10,081
exposed the CIA selling drugs in south
central Los Angeles and he exposed the

3145
02:48:10,481 --> 02:48:12,160
whole thing.
And you know,

3146
02:48:12,161 --> 02:48:16,120
this is a guy who was a fucking former
narcotics officer and he saw them selling

3147
02:48:16,121 --> 02:48:19,650
it and it was like, you know
what? Fuck this. This is
crazy. I'm out of here. And he,

3148
02:48:19,730 --> 02:48:24,010
he did do what he should
do. William Binney, right?

3149
02:48:24,030 --> 02:48:27,260
Like William Benny. Exactly.
But much like William Benny.

3150
02:48:27,270 --> 02:48:31,360
So his life is in chaos since then,
you know, I mean, it's uh, to,

3151
02:48:31,361 --> 02:48:34,510
to run around like this guy,
this port mathematician and get guns.

3152
02:48:34,511 --> 02:48:38,020
Putting your face for what exactly?
For what?

3153
02:48:38,021 --> 02:48:40,840
For exposing something that is
like mean this guy is a pain.

3154
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:44,880
Yeah. For exposing something that is
really destructive to the constitution.

3155
02:48:46,380 --> 02:48:50,880
And trap wire. Let's talk about
that. Uh, I know this is rude,

3156
02:48:50,881 --> 02:48:54,070
but can I do another Pittsburgh? Oh yeah.
You're an elemental. We got five minutes,

3157
02:48:54,071 --> 02:48:57,630
Joe. We've got a little baby bladder. I
need to get to trap wire. Can you hold,

3158
02:48:57,770 --> 02:49:01,140
can you hold it, hold it.
Hold trap wire for people.

3159
02:49:01,141 --> 02:49:03,540
Because this is apparently the
longest podcast we've ever done.

3160
02:49:04,290 --> 02:49:08,040
We only have five minutes. Yep.
Shit. Trap wire, uh, came out

3161
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:12,630
of, so wiki leaks and one of their
latest batches of emails has a bunch of

3162
02:49:12,631 --> 02:49:15,420
correspondence within this
company called Strat for,

3163
02:49:15,780 --> 02:49:17,310
which is a private intelligence firm.

3164
02:49:17,670 --> 02:49:20,940
It's kind of like the
privatized version of the CIA.

3165
02:49:21,210 --> 02:49:24,460
And I think the CIA would be offended
by that comparison because Strikeforce

3166
02:49:24,500 --> 02:49:27,480
seems a lot less competent,
uh, than the CIA.

3167
02:49:27,481 --> 02:49:29,640
But straight forwards just this
private intelligence company,

3168
02:49:29,641 --> 02:49:33,780
they gather information, uh, for a variety
of clients like private corporations.

3169
02:49:33,781 --> 02:49:35,640
I think coca cola has used them before.

3170
02:49:35,970 --> 02:49:39,810
Just gather information on whatever they
need. Uh, don't hold me to Coca Cola,

3171
02:49:39,811 --> 02:49:41,760
but I'm pretty certain they've used them.
They have big clients,

3172
02:49:41,761 --> 02:49:45,120
big fortune 500 companies, and they
get data and do all this stuff anyway.

3173
02:49:45,121 --> 02:49:48,330
And the emails that the strap for
executives are sending back and forth.

3174
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:52,410
A lot of confidential stuff was revealed
about all kinds of things that the

3175
02:49:52,411 --> 02:49:53,760
public is not supposed to know about.

3176
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:57,130
And one of those was a company
called trap wire, which, uh,

3177
02:49:57,180 --> 02:50:01,470
developed a computer algorithm that
basically tracks people using public

3178
02:50:01,471 --> 02:50:03,990
surveillance cameras. That's
the best way to describe it. Uh,

3179
02:50:04,080 --> 02:50:07,270
using things like gait
recognition, the way you walk, uh,

3180
02:50:07,290 --> 02:50:11,580
it can potentially recognize you from
one spot to the next and it can flag you

3181
02:50:11,581 --> 02:50:15,270
for suspicious behavior, but you don't
know what the suspicious behaviors are.

3182
02:50:15,510 --> 02:50:19,500
They think it can be something like just
taking photographs of a landmark that

3183
02:50:19,501 --> 02:50:23,700
flags you into the system or a signaling
for your family to come over so that

3184
02:50:24,150 --> 02:50:26,640
they can take a photo with you,
things like that.

3185
02:50:26,641 --> 02:50:30,480
Or just loitering in an area for too long.
So this computer program,

3186
02:50:30,481 --> 02:50:32,430
it's not a person with judgment.

3187
02:50:32,670 --> 02:50:36,780
This computer algorithm decides you're
suspicious individual and a threat,

3188
02:50:36,960 --> 02:50:39,150
and then puts you into their
system and profiles you.

3189
02:50:39,420 --> 02:50:41,160
And then when you go somewhere else,

3190
02:50:41,161 --> 02:50:43,860
like let's say you're initially flagged
somewhere in the state of Texas,

3191
02:50:43,980 --> 02:50:46,140
that a couple months later
you're on vacation in New York,

3192
02:50:46,440 --> 02:50:48,000
one of the subway cameras in New York.

3193
02:50:48,120 --> 02:50:51,450
Can we identify you and build
a file of where you've been,

3194
02:50:51,451 --> 02:50:53,790
where you know and predict your behavior,

3195
02:50:53,850 --> 02:50:56,460
possibly even predict where you might
go next based on where you've been.

3196
02:50:56,670 --> 02:50:58,470
Just another way that government,
uh,

3197
02:50:58,500 --> 02:51:03,000
and private corporations might be tracking
people without their approval. I mean,

3198
02:51:03,001 --> 02:51:06,360
this is a clear violation of the fourth
amendment. We can't stop this podcast,

3199
02:51:06,361 --> 02:51:10,470
Brian, we have to talk about those. Let's
stop it and start it again until you get

3200
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:13,260
eight minutes.
So I think you,

3201
02:51:13,261 --> 02:51:17,160
can I give you a fake buffer just because
I notice you and don't pay attention.

3202
02:51:18,740 --> 02:51:22,800
Yeah. So trap artist is just a such
a, such a, so it's a crazy situation.

3203
02:51:22,801 --> 02:51:26,190
It's a company where
their clients are mixed.

3204
02:51:26,250 --> 02:51:29,430
Some of their clients are a
powerful government agencies.

3205
02:51:29,431 --> 02:51:33,210
And I think even the u s military uses
this software at army bases and this is

3206
02:51:33,211 --> 02:51:36,510
all legal. Well, I personally don't
think it's legal. I think it just hasn't.

3207
02:51:36,720 --> 02:51:39,840
It's something that nobody would have
known about had it not been for wikileaks

3208
02:51:40,050 --> 02:51:45,050
and the hacker who allegedly brought
these emails out is now riding in a jail

3209
02:51:45,781 --> 02:51:46,800
right now.
Now,

3210
02:51:46,801 --> 02:51:50,550
this whole wikileaks situation about
him being in the Ecuador embassy,

3211
02:51:50,551 --> 02:51:55,530
how crazy is that? That is completely
crazy that this is our big right now,

3212
02:51:55,531 --> 02:51:59,010
this is the US government's one of our
biggest priorities is this dude and this

3213
02:51:59,011 --> 02:51:59,880
dude,
by the way,

3214
02:51:59,881 --> 02:52:04,410
they're trying to get him out under this
most ridiculous charge of surprise sex.

3215
02:52:04,440 --> 02:52:06,010
Right? That's what it is. What it, what it

3216
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:10,300
is is he had sex with a woman and I
guess the alleged story is that he did it

3217
02:52:10,301 --> 02:52:13,660
with a condom on and then they were lying
in bed together with no condom and he

3218
02:52:13,661 --> 02:52:17,790
stuck it in again and it's,
it's craziness. Well craziness.

3219
02:52:17,800 --> 02:52:20,470
If they're willing to like,
that's the going after this guy,

3220
02:52:20,860 --> 02:52:23,260
a woman that he actually had said,
yeah, it was a douchebag move. I mean,

3221
02:52:23,261 --> 02:52:24,740
if she wanted to wear a
condom and you didn't,

3222
02:52:24,750 --> 02:52:26,230
I mean that's a douchebag move for sure,

3223
02:52:26,231 --> 02:52:30,730
but you're going to have this gigantic
manhunt for him where he has to hold

3224
02:52:30,731 --> 02:52:34,930
himself up in a fucking embassy and to,
to avoid extradition to this country for,

3225
02:52:35,130 --> 02:52:39,160
and it just so happens that he's the guy
that releases all this information that

3226
02:52:39,161 --> 02:52:43,810
shows helicopters gunning people
down the street, mistaken them for,

3227
02:52:43,870 --> 02:52:44,890
for terrorists.

3228
02:52:45,060 --> 02:52:46,830
Yeah. Well the thing with wikileaks, uh,

3229
02:52:47,310 --> 02:52:50,190
when they reveal stuff that
potentially compromises, uh,

3230
02:52:50,670 --> 02:52:53,280
informants and gets
innocent people killed,

3231
02:52:53,320 --> 02:52:55,470
I haven't seen a single instance
of that actually happening,

3232
02:52:55,471 --> 02:52:58,560
but that argument has been made. And
when that is done, I'm not okay with it.

3233
02:52:58,561 --> 02:53:01,110
That is wrong to put innocent
people in harm's way.

3234
02:53:01,111 --> 02:53:03,750
You're releasing information that
should not be in the public eye,

3235
02:53:03,780 --> 02:53:06,660
but it's advocate to note that you've
done that. Right. But that's the thing.

3236
02:53:06,900 --> 02:53:08,880
He has not done that as far as I know.
Uh,

3237
02:53:08,910 --> 02:53:13,730
in terms of releasing that video of
innocent people being gunned down and

3238
02:53:13,731 --> 02:53:17,370
children being shot full
of lead, uh, that video.

3239
02:53:17,371 --> 02:53:18,810
And then this thing about trap wire,

3240
02:53:18,960 --> 02:53:21,720
I think these are things that are
in the public interest very much so.

3241
02:53:22,110 --> 02:53:24,840
I like to know that all of these new
surveillance cameras going up in towns and

3242
02:53:24,841 --> 02:53:27,660
cities because there are a lot of them
now that we're not there a couple of

3243
02:53:27,660 --> 02:53:30,480
years ago that many of these could be
plugged into trap wire that's useful

3244
02:53:30,481 --> 02:53:34,680
public information. That's what the media
used to do. And a previous generation,

3245
02:53:34,681 --> 02:53:37,590
it would be like Walter Cronkite or
Edward Murrow telling you about this.

3246
02:53:37,740 --> 02:53:42,720
It would not be Julian
Assange on his little, on his
wikileaks form, you know. So,

3247
02:53:43,470 --> 02:53:46,530
uh, I think in some regards what he's
doing is at the forefront of journalism.

3248
02:53:46,920 --> 02:53:50,700
And it's funny you brought up the specific
charge that Sweden is trying to get

3249
02:53:50,701 --> 02:53:54,240
them on a,
because I've said stuff on Twitter before.

3250
02:53:54,241 --> 02:53:57,810
I've said like what I just said no
about how, I think that's journalism.

3251
02:53:58,020 --> 02:54:01,560
You put something out there
that's tremendously important
to the public and that

3252
02:54:01,561 --> 02:54:05,670
is being covered up and not known.
That's journalism. And somebody said,

3253
02:54:05,671 --> 02:54:08,730
why are you defending a rapist like
Julian Assange? And I said, first of all,

3254
02:54:08,731 --> 02:54:11,040
that's not even the charge.
He's not being charged with rape.

3255
02:54:11,280 --> 02:54:13,380
So get your facts straight.
And second of all,

3256
02:54:13,410 --> 02:54:16,920
since when does a alleging
that somebody did something,

3257
02:54:16,921 --> 02:54:20,350
that means they're automatically guilty.
It doesn't matter that there's, you know,

3258
02:54:20,490 --> 02:54:23,970
tremendous pressure being placed on
them to nail this guy on something.

3259
02:54:24,090 --> 02:54:27,360
It's so transparent. It's so big. It
was so obvious that it's something else.

3260
02:54:27,930 --> 02:54:31,380
And then going after him from that
wall in Sweden is weird. Like,

3261
02:54:31,890 --> 02:54:36,180
I don't think there's an analog of that
in the u s it'd be like, uh, it just,

3262
02:54:36,210 --> 02:54:36,850
it doesn't make sense.

3263
02:54:36,850 --> 02:54:40,840
It's not right. It's not what did
it, it's craziness that there,

3264
02:54:40,930 --> 02:54:44,200
if the race did so much resources to
try to drag him out of the country like

3265
02:54:44,201 --> 02:54:45,490
this, it's terrifying. Yeah. Yeah.

3266
02:54:46,140 --> 02:54:46,741
Well they're doing it.

3267
02:54:46,741 --> 02:54:49,520
To make an example and then talking
about storming the Ecuadorian embassy,

3268
02:54:49,560 --> 02:54:50,940
you make an example out of him.

3269
02:54:51,450 --> 02:54:54,540
Nobody else is going to have the balls
to create a wiki leaks too. It's done.

3270
02:54:54,620 --> 02:54:55,890
Isn't that an act of war?

3271
02:54:55,950 --> 02:54:59,040
If they enjoy it and it ends
the whole diplomatic system,

3272
02:54:59,250 --> 02:55:03,500
the whole system of embassies, which
is pretty important stuff. Otherwise,

3273
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:06,680
if we don't have that,
then we're just a bunch of animals,

3274
02:55:06,681 --> 02:55:09,620
just different countries battling
for resources at all times.

3275
02:55:09,890 --> 02:55:13,610
And you have no ground rules. I mean
an embassy is a pretty sacred thing.

3276
02:55:15,890 --> 02:55:18,770
So disturbing. And so
part of our reality, man,

3277
02:55:19,130 --> 02:55:23,990
I can only hope that with guys like you
running for Congress and with this young

3278
02:55:23,991 --> 02:55:25,010
generation that's coming up,

3279
02:55:25,011 --> 02:55:27,800
and this is one of the things that I've
said is that I don't think you're going

3280
02:55:27,801 --> 02:55:30,650
to change these creepy old vampire
dudes that are running banks.

3281
02:55:30,651 --> 02:55:35,050
I think they are fucking set in their
ways and they're a bunch of old douchebags

3282
02:55:35,150 --> 02:55:38,900
and our only hope is the upcoming
generation. Guys like you, it's time for,

3283
02:55:38,960 --> 02:55:42,770
it's time for everybody to step up who
wants to these mid twenties motherfuckers

3284
02:55:42,771 --> 02:55:46,820
with uh, uh, uh, a dedication to change.

3285
02:55:47,030 --> 02:55:49,220
And uh, so thanks for doing
what you're doing, man.

3286
02:55:49,250 --> 02:55:52,240
And anytime you wanna come on the podcast,
we'd be more than happy to. Thanks.

3287
02:55:52,530 --> 02:55:54,650
Having me on is an awesome show.
I'm not just saying that.

3288
02:55:54,651 --> 02:55:57,920
It's like the only place where you can
talk about stuff like this for hours.

3289
02:55:58,010 --> 02:56:01,640
I go about to explode from the, from
the urine and my bladder. But uh,

3290
02:56:01,970 --> 02:56:03,470
that's great.
Like nothing else does that.

3291
02:56:03,471 --> 02:56:05,180
Like you get right into
something important,

3292
02:56:05,181 --> 02:56:08,240
then they cut you off and that's it
because everybody's so add that that's all

3293
02:56:08,241 --> 02:56:09,260
you get.
Well,

3294
02:56:09,261 --> 02:56:12,740
I think that we've been tricked into
thinking that that's the only way people

3295
02:56:12,741 --> 02:56:13,460
will pay attention.

3296
02:56:13,460 --> 02:56:16,100
That you have to give them this little
quick sound bites and then quit.

3297
02:56:16,140 --> 02:56:21,080
We is Kim Kardashians getting up and
asked. It's too big. You'll be the judge.

3298
02:56:21,081 --> 02:56:25,820
We'll be right back. Yeah, we, we were
so like we were so like distracted.

3299
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:30,980
But there's a lot of people that are
realizing that podcasts and things like

3300
02:56:30,981 --> 02:56:32,890
this, these conversations, it's,

3301
02:56:32,900 --> 02:56:37,610
it's an opportunity to get a really be
involved really in your own ear buds,

3302
02:56:37,611 --> 02:56:42,440
you know, to, to be considering both
sides and, and maybe your own opinion.

3303
02:56:42,440 --> 02:56:45,260
It doesn't even get expressed that you
want to express to me on Twitter later or

3304
02:56:45,261 --> 02:56:45,860
whatever.

3305
02:56:45,860 --> 02:56:50,600
But to be a part of a conversation
between two people talking about something

3306
02:56:50,601 --> 02:56:53,210
that you think is really important or
you think is really interesting and that

3307
02:56:53,510 --> 02:56:56,540
didn't exist before because we had too
many fucking people that were telling

3308
02:56:56,541 --> 02:57:00,440
people what isn't. It is an interesting,
instead of just doing it naturally, right?

3309
02:57:00,710 --> 02:57:03,310
So anytime you want to come back on it,
man, we'd be more than happy. All right.

3310
02:57:03,311 --> 02:57:07,160

Seaman and the fucking house.

and parts of Broward and Miami Dade.

But most of your listeners aren't there.
Uh, what we really need is money. Uh,
