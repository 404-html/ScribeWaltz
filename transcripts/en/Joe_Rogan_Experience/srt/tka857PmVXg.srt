1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,590
And Effects Donna or was that you?
That was me.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,330
Okay.
Alright.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,990
I thought you.
I thought you paid for that were live 

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:10,990
Ron White.
Hey Joe.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,500
Are you ready to take notes on this?
You know,

6
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:18,501
you,
you shove some paperwork at me when I 

7
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:18,501
don't have my glasses.
I don't even know what it says.

8
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:19,100
You have glasses on?
I do.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,820
Oh yeah,
I do.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,410
Yeah.
And I'm not sure,

11
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:28,950
but I think I've just agreed to find.
We trust me.

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,690
We wouldn't do anything terrible to you 
know,

13
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:31,470
you're my friend.
I know.

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,940
I love you.
I love you too.

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,170
We have a mutual admiration society that
we don't let anybody else in.

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,750
It's been so on in,
but fuck them.

17
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:42,120
Fuck down.
It's been so nice having you run a store

18
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:42,930
man.
I got to tell you.

19
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,260
It's really fun.
Yeah.

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,580
That's great.
When you were man,

21
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,480
our little home base up there.

22
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,990
It's a fucking hoot.
It is,

23
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:52,110
right?
It's like a work on everything there and

24
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:56,620
then venture forth right spot.
And I've driven that,

25
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,470
you know,
I've just got this big quandary now,

26
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:03,060
whether it even do another special or 
what it would do for me and you know,

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,170
Netflix is offering me money,
but they're not offering me be,

28
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,350
you know,
huge money.

29
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:11,040
They're offering me regular money trying
to figure out if you want to.

30
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,180
Yeah.
You know,

31
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:14,190
it takes me.
I'm not like some comics.

32
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,880
Some comics will spit out of our year 
and uh,

33
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:19,020
and I don't,
you know,

34
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:21,330
I did takes me three years to write a 
new record,

35
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,130
you know,
but it's good,

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,060
you know,
but it's.

37
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,730
But it takes me forever to do it.
I just not that prolific.

38
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:29,460
I guess that's the big debate with 
comedians.

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,900
Like how much time should you wait?

40
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,900
And Tom,
papa and I were just talking about it 

41
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,791
and I've talked about with burn with 
Louis Ck and a bunch of different guys 

42
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:38,280
and lily's doing like one a year for a 
while.

43
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:43,281
But he stopped doing that and I think he
kind of agrees now that when you do one 

44
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:43,920
a year,
it's almost like,

45
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:47,550
um,
it's a special full of like a adolescent

46
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,020
premises.
Yeah,

47
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,690
yeah,
and I've always found it.

48
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,310
My stuff ripens well,
you know,

49
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:54,840
on the vine,
if I leave it there,

50
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:56,860
if I pick it too early,
you know,

51
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,870
used to do a bit that was on my last 
album and the punchline is not even on 

52
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,260
the album.
The punchline I wrote later,

53
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:09,261
which was a,
it's about my wife buy me a bicycle 

54
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:10,920
thing and I might ride it for health 
reasons and it is for sale and if you're

55
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:12,330
looking for a bicycle is a great deal.

56
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,330
It's got 750 yards on it.
It was a demo when I bought it at 350 

57
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,381
yards already on it,
but I put the other 400 yards on it 

58
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:21,381
myself.
That was the whole joke.

59
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:24,330
Now here's the punchline and if you'd 
like to buy the bicycle,

60
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:28,410
just go to my house in Beverly Hills and
it's 400 yards from there.

61
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,190
So I didn't even have the punchline.
I didn't even know what I thought was 

62
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,190
funny about the other part,
but when I went back and listened to it,

63
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,991
I'm like,
I could start doing that bit again 

64
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:38,991
because they still don't know how it 
ends.

65
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,080
If I wanted to.
Mitch Hedberg did that.

66
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:43,680
He had a bit on his album and he goes,
this is a bit from my old album,

67
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,820
and he does a bit.
He goes,

68
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,730
this is the part I left out.
This is the punchline.

69
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,110
That's hilarious.

70
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,710
Yeah,
it's a,

71
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:53,760
it's a funny thing,
you know,

72
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:58,761
development of material,
like you're the only one who really 

73
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,440
knows when it's done and sometimes 
you'll have something.

74
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,530
I've had bits that I didn't put it on 
specials that I was doing.

75
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,910
I was like,
this thing is not just,

76
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:06,190
it's not ready.
And then maybe two specials later,

77
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,500
I'll stick it in somewhere.
Right.

78
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,570
Yeah.
So I don't know,

79
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:11,170
you know,
that Netflix wants an hour.

80
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,910
I,
I really think that fluke spatial should

81
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,800
be 30 minutes.
I really,

82
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,270
I really do because I would do a 30 
minute special and that and that burnout

83
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:20,770
in our material on it.
Uh,

84
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,260
and,
you know,

85
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:23,590
I,
I go back,

86
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,570
I want shoes the other day,
which was great.

87
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,220
And uh,
and uh,

88
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:29,210
I watched the,
uh,

89
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,240
the uh,
Ali wongs special and it was just long,

90
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,420
you know,
it just long an hour's a long time,

91
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,650
uh,
for,

92
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:38,950
for,
uh,

93
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:43,951
special and that as much as I was 
impressed by Allie and I still am 

94
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,230
impressed by Allie,
uh,

95
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,270
but I've been impressed with what I see 
in the club when I go back and watch 

96
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,270
your special.

97
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,980
I see what kind of confidence that 
broader,

98
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:56,530
that success of that thing.
It made her a better comic.

99
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:58,780
You know,
she now she really has a great,

100
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,200
I mean,
uh,

101
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,290
uh,
be even better presence on stage and 

102
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:04,890
works even slower and more commanding,
but I can,

103
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,010
you know,
that's what I learned from watching it 

104
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:10,010
was,
you know,

105
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,691
that kind of,
that kind of success makes you better 

106
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:12,691
for her.
I mean,

107
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:14,800
she sort of emerging right now.
She's one of those people that,

108
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:15,970
you know,
people started to talk about.

109
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:16,960
She's very,
very funny.

110
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,410
She's really cool to really nice person,
but it's just nasty and funny on stage 

111
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,640
is vicious and I don't know her because 
she's got a kid so soon as she gets off 

112
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:28,750
stage,
he's out of there.

113
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:31,870
So I talked to her on stage a couple of 
times when she was bringing me.

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,360
Yeah,
yeah,

115
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,760
yeah man.
I'd like an hour,

116
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,890
like an hour,
like a good hour special,

117
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,160
you know,
maybe just don't want to have cheap.

118
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,720
It's don't want to do it.
I don't want to do the work,

119
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:46,060
man.
It's so daunting to put it.

120
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:51,061
I mean,
my last bedroom was an hour and 20 

121
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:51,061
minutes and I,
and that's just,

122
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:52,640
cause that's how long it was and when 
I've,

123
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,980
when I sold it,
I'm like,

124
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:58,981
I don't want to go ahead and let,
you know as I worked like that you can 

125
00:04:58,981 --> 00:04:59,710
have the whole thing.
And then I'm standing there naked,

126
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,440
you know,
I could've gotten away with 48 minutes.

127
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,250
Uh,
you know,

128
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,710
because it was on television and nobody 
saw it on tv because it was on cmt.

129
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,260
Nobody wants his fucking cmt.
So nobody's even heard the last album.

130
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:12,810
And I don't do it,
you know,

131
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,050
country music,
television.

132
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:18,160
Isn't that real popular was called 
country music television anymore.

133
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,970
They just call it cmt,
uh,

134
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,690
started.
Uh,

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,120
yeah,
I think it still stands for country 

136
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,481
music television,
but they're trying to do a bunch of 

137
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:27,481
other shit now too.
Right?

138
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:27,481
They try to do,
you know,

139
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:28,280
they did a,
I did it.

140
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,140
I had a special with them once a year 
and I would do then I would just have to

141
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:34,350
come up with 15 minutes.
And uh,

142
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,920
which was doable,
you know,

143
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,660
I,
I that,

144
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,090
that I could actually put on TV,
most of it you shouldn't even put on TV.

145
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:43,220
But uh,
but that was great.

146
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:48,250
It was a salute to the troops thing and 
raise money and awareness for good 

147
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:48,980
stuff.
And then they quit doing it and uh,

148
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,710
somehow bought my special and a put.
But.

149
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,630
So I just,
you know,

150
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,050
if I do a bit from it,
you know,

151
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:56,830
it,
it kills.

152
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:57,860
Like nobody's heard it.

153
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,470
So I really don't think anybody really 
hurt it.

154
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,060
Only sold 12 copies of those people,
you know,

155
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,520
12.
They know that.

156
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:09,521
I have no idea how many we were talking 
about that before the show about like 

157
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:11,840
buying things,
like nobody buys comedy albums anymore.

158
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,190
They don't,
they just don't make any money,

159
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,300
right?
Like none.

160
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,370
Yeah,
I did.

161
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,450
I just started watching stuff on Netflix
the other day because I just wanted to 

162
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,871
watch some of the specials at some of 
the people I knew up there to see what 

163
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:25,871
they were doing,
you know,

164
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:25,960
what they're working on.
And,

165
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,980
and,
uh,

166
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,620
now why would you buy a fucking record?
You can just flip it over to Netflix and

167
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:33,200
watch it.
I like listening to shit in my car.

168
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,330
I like when people release things on 
itunes.

169
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,580
He had did that.
Uh,

170
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:37,240
my,
my,

171
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,270
uh,
my best.

172
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:43,271
I'm a comedy album store story and I 
don't mean this to be mean or anything 

173
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:44,450
else.

174
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,650
Uh,
but it was a,

175
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,650
I was watching the red,
the record sales because my records were

176
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:54,651
selling and then uh,
then Dane Cook comes in and he just 

177
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:55,560
blows by me and I'm like,
who is this guy?

178
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,310
Because I'm an la guy.
I'm a road guy,

179
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,990
you know,
we don't know what's going on out here,

180
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:03,700
nor do we give a shit and uh,
but I thought well it must be.

181
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,500
So I was at a bookstore and I saw it and
I thought,

182
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,930
well I want to,
I want to buy it and see what,

183
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,040
see what it's like.
So literally I'll listen to it on the 

184
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,040
way home.
When I got home I pulled it out,

185
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,450
throw it in the trash.
Not not to be mean,

186
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:18,260
but just because I don't keep things I 
don't use,

187
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,540
but I knew I wouldn't listen to it again
and I wasn't going to give it to 

188
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:23,540
somebody else to listen to.

189
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,890
And so I don't need it anymore.
It's a,

190
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:26,060
it we've run our,
you know,

191
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,080
run our thing and not to say anything 
bad about Dang because that been plenty 

192
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,340
of bad things have been said.
But,

193
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,190
but I just went.
That was so unintuitive that I'm like,

194
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,200
if that's what they're doing out there,
then they're getting away with murder 

195
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,710
because that was our punchlines.
I'm sorry to tell you,

196
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,630
that was a weird time.
He locked into some weird thing where he

197
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:52,420
sort of appealed to young girls like he 
did comedy girls.

198
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,080
No,
no,

199
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,970
that's not you.
That's not me either.

200
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,840
Yeah.
It's not.

201
00:07:56,841 --> 00:08:01,841
A lot of us leg had fascinating stage 
presence too and you know,

202
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,380
just really walk on stage and take 
command of anything,

203
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,580
you know.
I don't know if he can still do it,

204
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:09,440
but at one time I'd watch him and I'm 
like,

205
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:10,400
you're lacking or not.

206
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,550
If you're a comic you could probably 
learn something from watching him.

207
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:14,930
It was a young comic,
you know,

208
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:17,180
just walk up there and start doing it.
Stare him down.

209
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:18,440
Don't be timid,
you know,

210
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:22,880
when he was a great stage presence.
But the content I was like,

211
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,830
why,
what,

212
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,900
what,
why don't get it.

213
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:29,210
I don't get it when we,
but,

214
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,370
and now it gets.
It's turned around on him.

215
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:33,180
I mean it's not know.
I don't know.

216
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,210
Well it turned around on him when that 
whole Louis ck plagiarism thing came out

217
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:42,710
and there's a lot of shit going on.
I was supposed to have sold something.

218
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:44,810
Stole something from Louis.
Oh yeah.

219
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,300
Like a lot of things.
Yeah,

220
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,220
before Louis was famous.
Yup.

221
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,540
Oh yeah.
Well that's when it's easy.

222
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,150
Lilly was a,
while.

224
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:55,070
They're young.
Lose wasn't young.

225
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,360
He was older than him,
but lilly,

226
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,530
he made it first.

227
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,110
He broke through first and then it 
became a giant controversy.

228
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:05,490
Like Louis could even addressed it on 
his television show.

229
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,700
Like he had Dane on as a guest on that 
show and they kind of went over it.

230
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,260
It was very weird.
Like Louis,

231
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,320
he's so nice.
Like the way he handled it was so nice.

232
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,430
Like he wasn't mean about it at all.
Right.

233
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:23,130
They not like you as well.
That was a difference there.

234
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:28,131
Was this the best thing ever?
That was that where you had every comic 

235
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:28,250
in the country just cheering her fucking
name,

236
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:30,150
man.
Go get them Joe.

237
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,740
And,
and you're such a bad ass.

238
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,190
What's he gonna do?
Slap you,

239
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,670
you know,
you can either listen to it or you can 

240
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,990
beat you up or whatever you want.
What are you going to do?

241
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,730
That was the worst I've ever seen 
though.

242
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,330
I've seen.

243
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:47,390
I've seen plagiarist before.
I've seen guys get away with stealing 

244
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,070
people's shit.
But I've never seen someone that 

245
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,070
blatant,
he was a bully about it.

246
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,961
Like he would do your shit.
He would go on in front of you and do 

247
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:56,451
your shit.
Like he would bring you up at the store 

248
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:57,000
into your closing bit before we brought 
you up,

249
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,800
man.
Yeah,

250
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:01,560
I think it's one of those things like a 
serial killer wants to get caught.

251
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,380
You know,
you think that's what it is.

252
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,200
Yeah,
I do.

253
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,150
I really do.
I really do.

254
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,200
Well,
you know,

255
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:07,740
the,
the,

256
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:11,370
the only thing that matters to me really
is.

257
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,430
I mean the,
or the thing I'm most proud of is that 

258
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,340
I'm respected by my peers that I didn't 
get here in some fucking cheap way.

259
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:21,630
I did my fucking 30 years and uh,
a mad million clubs and 12,000

260
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:24,390
shows and,
and if I didn't have that,

261
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,060
I don't know if I'd be able to show my 
face around here.

262
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,940
No,
that's all there is.

263
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:32,220
I think it's the.
I think for people like us,

264
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:35,100
it's probably the most important thing 
because there's so few of us.

265
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:40,101
I mean it.
Is there a thousand working comedians 

266
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:40,101
is,
or even a thousand?

267
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:40,280
I mean,
there might not even be a thousand.

268
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,420
Yeah,
it's a tiny,

269
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,990
tiny subculture.
Tiny and none of that subculture.

270
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,790
Maybe 300 of them I want to see,
you know,

271
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,630
maybe.
Maybe,

272
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,410
maybe.
Right.

273
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:56,070
So you're one of 300 people at a $300 
million.

274
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,950
That's a,
that's a tiny fuck.

275
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,480
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.

276
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,190
I'm going to get.
I'm getting buff.

277
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,810
I'm getting above.
Just sitting here.

278
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,630
You get fired up right there.
Last sheer.

279
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,050
It is.
I wish we brought you Tequila,

280
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:09,150
man.
I'm glad.

281
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,200
I really,
if I would have had to sat here and 

282
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,941
drank it with you and then I'd been out.
Now I had to go get that range rover 

283
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,120
back to Uber's for.

284
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,850
And that's got some good goddamn 
Tequila.

285
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,500
I love the fact that you sell your own 
Tequila.

286
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,110
Well,
you know what?

287
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,120
We wouldn't have done it,
but the rescue his family that makes it 

288
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,761
wouldn't sell it here.
And so we just passed her up because we 

289
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:31,761
couldn't buy it.
And,

290
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:35,750
and uh,
until then my brother in law did and he 

291
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,390
pestered him for four years and they 
finally said,

292
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,140
okay,
you can,

293
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,270
you can bring it over there.
They only sell it in Mexico.

294
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,580
They,
they only sell it in Mexico.

295
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:45,210
They say in Mexico,
they sell it for three times what I sell

296
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:50,211
it for here.
And they only sell it in the resort 

297
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:50,211
cities.
People coming off those boats.

298
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,480
And uh,
and you know,

299
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:55,180
it's the Best Tequila that most liquor 
stores will ever touch.

300
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:55,880
And,
and,

301
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,890
uh,
so it was called the gift of God over 

302
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:00,890
there.

303
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,090
The,
there were a,

304
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,100
I don't know how to say it,
man.

305
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,270
Spam.
She's Mexican.

306
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,000
So she can tell you though.
She speaks fluent.

307
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:12,130
Oh yeah.
Did she get mad at you and speaking 

308
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:12,130
Spanish?
Uh,

309
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,110
no.
But when she does do it,

310
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:15,490
she's a voiceover artist as well as a 
singer,

311
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,470
so she can do any accent.
There is.

312
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,460
And she has different wigs for different
accents and she lets me fuck them all.

313
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,430
Oh yeah,
it was fucking great man.

314
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:26,740
It's fucking terrible.
I can't ask for them specifically.

315
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:28,630
They just show up.
Oh,

316
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:30,520
what an interesting little situation.
Yeah.

317
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,960
One of them is,
uh,

318
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,290
one of them's name was Donna and she's a
bank teller from Denton,

319
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,800
Texas and uh,
you know,

320
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,650
she's a sloppy,
sloppy,

321
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:45,400
blowjobs and different on it.
That is don is off the charts.

322
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,400
She a favorite.
There's a little French girl.

323
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,180
There's a little,
there's a little girl from China,

324
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,160
Japan.

325
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,360
Uh,
I like them all.

326
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,840
I like to mix them up.
Don't ever want to say the data gives a 

327
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,680
better blowjob in Margo because it's 
technically not through,

328
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,700
but she's still like,
Oh really?

329
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,230
I'm like,
Oh really?

330
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,950
Yeah.
How could you say?

331
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,580
Could you get upset at you?
She's getting jealous of herself.

332
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,020
Right?
That's ridiculous.

333
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,370
But it can happen.
Why?

334
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:14,260
Just because she spits on your Dick.
Whoa.

335
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,190
Yeah.
Okay.

336
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:16,490
When you say that on,
definitely.

337
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,130
Got It.
Okay,

338
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,680
good.
Sure.

339
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,470
Yeah.
Some people are into that spitting on 

340
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:23,470
the tech thing.
It's just like,

341
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:23,470
well,
we aren't getting dirty for sure.

342
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,090
Push,
push.

343
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,850
Yeah.
It's the people that can't afford lube.

344
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,110
What do you think that started to 
spitting on the deck?

345
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:30,670
Because I don't think they did that in 
the eighties.

346
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,350
You don't think so?
I don't think so.

347
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,670
I never saw it,
you know,

348
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,680
just uh,
I think youporn brought it around a 

349
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,820
brought it into the,
into the light when you see variety 

350
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:41,820
instantaneously.

351
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,380
Like you don't have to venture forth 
into the weird sections,

352
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,620
you know,
like if you're in a video store back in 

353
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,181
the old days,
you had to go through those beads 

354
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,090
around.
And I remember though it was a saloon 

355
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,090
doors or beads,
right.

356
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:57,511
We had to go into the section of the 
video store that had the porn and you 

357
00:13:57,511 --> 00:13:57,990
always felt so full of shame when you 
were wandering.

358
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,600
Affordable.
It was a horrible man.

359
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:03,730
Nobody does this but me.
But now you know,

360
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,730
but at least back then no one had a 
phone with a camera.

361
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:08,440
So you couldn't like take a video.
Look,

362
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:10,680
I'm watching Ron white go to the fucking
dirty section.

363
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:15,710
What I said before,
he's looking at the gag stuff.

364
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:18,140
He likes people to gag.
I do,

365
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,700
but that's the thing now it's like you 
can go to any one of those websites and 

366
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,180
have the porn on it and you can just 
keep scrolling like,

367
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:25,950
oh,
check this out,

368
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:26,250
check it.

369
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,120
And you get it instantaneously and it's 
free.

370
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,280
Right.
But that's what I like about,

371
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,370
uh,
you porn is that a is I don't have to 

372
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,220
worry about seeing something I don't 
want to see,

373
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,690
you know,
I'm such a raging heterosexual and I,

374
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:42,550
I tried one time I was in a hotel room,
they had gay porn,

375
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,850
like I'm going to have watched them gay 
porn.

376
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,140
See if it does anything.
Click nothing.

377
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,130
Not a damn thing.
I'm like,

378
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:53,131
oh Jesus Christ as his horrible.
And I guess I'm getting fucking.

379
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,600
Some people are just straight.
Well as women like Dick.

380
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,810
So I mean it makes sense that some men 
like Dick,

381
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,700
I get it.
I do too,

382
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,730
but I didn't get it when it just 
doesn't,

383
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,310
you know that fucking story that you're 
telling on stage now,

384
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,000
the story that you told about the 
prostitute situation.

385
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:11,510
Yeah,
yeah,

386
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:11,780
yeah.

387
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,140
They,
you encouraged me to do a show funny 

388
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,400
crying.
I'll,

389
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,700
I'll tell,
I'll tell you,

390
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:20,630
you're are,
you're our,

391
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,750
you're our listeners now.
They're our listeners to joe and ron 

392
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:25,750
show.
Thank you.

393
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,660
I'll be here every Thursday at 1:30,
but it was true.

394
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,700
It's a lot of lost my virginity when I 
was 18 years old to a girl,

395
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:40,031
a prostitute and a in Tijuana,
Mexico who was overweight and her teeth 

396
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:46,361
had no general direction or color,
but she was well within my budget but I 

397
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:52,781
got stationed at Pearl and if I found 
out after awhile when she'd been on one 

398
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:57,160
part of Awahoo wasn't hotel st these 
really cute girls are jumping in your 

399
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,831
car and blow you for $5.
And it's like the best deal I've ever 

400
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:00,831
even fucking heard of.
I mean,

401
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:02,060
I was there twice a day,
you know,

402
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,760
and,
and uh,

403
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:08,770
I was there for eight months and then 
six months ago I was watching this 

404
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,790
documentary on transvestites and they 
started talking about the transvestite 

405
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,840
scene on hotel street on a wall who had 
been there for 55 years.

406
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,060
I might know 150 dudes suck my dick.
Like,

407
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,400
what's the record?
What's the record?

408
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:30,170
Before you find out when I went to 
record,

409
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,790
is that I don't know,
but God,

410
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,550
I have to be close.
You know I've dodged that bullet,

411
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:37,100
but I've come close a gang of time.
I think I've dodged the bullet.

412
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,200
Yeah.
If I had to dodge the bullet.

413
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:42,650
Kudos.
Everything pretended to be to apparently

414
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:47,651
it.
Tongue is a tongue and a tooth is the 

415
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:47,651
tooth because you can't tell man man 
from woman mouth.

416
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:49,220
Now if it would have been a hand job,
I'd been going,

417
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:49,880
hey,
you're a plumber.

418
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:52,460
Dude.
That hand on my cock.

419
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,140
Sick gorilla hands.
Jesus,

420
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,720
what do you think I am?
Yeah,

421
00:16:56,721 --> 00:17:01,721
and I would imagine that somebody who 
has a deck probably knows how to work 

422
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:01,721
it.
If I guess with.

423
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:06,620
I tell you what,
these girls had made quick work at me 

424
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:06,620
twice a day,
45 seconds.

425
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,860
I was in my little dots and be headed 
back to the ship.

426
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,000
Do you say girls with air quotes with 
air quotes girls?

427
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:14,540
Yeah.
Well,

428
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,310
I still don't like to think of them as 
dude.

429
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:21,311
You know,
in my mind that I don't let myself go 

430
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:21,311
there.
They're still hot little girls,

431
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:25,610
not little girls for these were fully 
developed in with tits tits.

432
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,690
They did and I was always wondering 
what,

433
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,010
let me play with her pose.
You know,

434
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:33,320
they,
they let you get some teddy,

435
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,920
but you started going down there where 
the junk is and they were like swat and 

436
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,850
your hand away and I'm like,
now that should have been a flag.

437
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,600
I don't know.
Yeah,

438
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,130
well now you know.
Yeah.

439
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,470
So what,
you were in the navy,

440
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:50,760
is that what you're doing?
How long?

441
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,380
I wasn't in real long.
Uh,

442
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,460
they uh,
you know,

443
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:59,660
I just wasn't cut out for it.
I had that.

444
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,380
I did,
I had the wrong mouth for it.

445
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,350
That stayed in trouble.
I didn't,

446
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,650
you know,
it just did a lot of drugs and you know,

447
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:08,090
I just,
it was horrible out.

448
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,610
They discharged me with an honorable 
discharge under medical conditions from 

449
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,700
the Naval Drug Rehabilitation Center in 
Miramar,

450
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:16,290
California.
Oh Wow.

451
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,080
So what would you have to get 
rehabilitated for?

452
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:25,070
Well,
I'd actually never seen drugs until I 

453
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,740
got to the drug rehabilitation center in
Miramar,

454
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,100
California.
I mean,

455
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:27,870
everybody had drugs,
you know,

456
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,510
I was positive for heroin,
a Westpac,

457
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:35,511
but,
so we're eight other people on the ship 

458
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:35,511
and,
and uh,

459
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:39,410
and uh,
then when we ate a ton of acid and you 

460
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,941
know,
it was 75 and I was 18 years old and 

461
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:42,990
that was off the hook wild.

462
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,960
And uh,
and you know,

463
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,590
they just actually in my,
in my hearing to get me out the,

464
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:57,090
the,
the commander of our base called me a 

465
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,110
hole in our national line of defense.
Like,

466
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,480
that's horrible.
But what's worse than that?

467
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:06,300
I wonder nothing.
It seems a little exaggerating.

468
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,050
Yeah.
Like I remember playing Red Rover,

469
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:11,580
you know,
relax,

470
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,510
holding our national defense.
It weren't even at Warren 75.

471
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:18,240
Right.
Wasn't the tail end of the Vietnam War.

472
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,530
Yeah.
Wow.

473
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,140
Did you join or did you get drafted now?
There was no draft.

474
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:23,550
When I,
my father drafted me.

475
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:27,690
I got kicked out of high school and uh,
and they weren't going to put me back in

476
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:30,340
this time.
And so I was 17.

477
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,490
I kind of had my life mapped out because
that worked washing dishes at this,

478
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:39,900
a huge restaurant called Lynchburg 
crossing in a close to Pasadena,

479
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:43,350
Texas and right on the channel,
gigantic place,

480
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:48,351
unbelievable and served family style,
all kinds of seafood and chicken and 

481
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,351
stuff.

482
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,580
It was really popular,
but they didn't have,

483
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,940
they didn't go hire people to wash 
dishes.

484
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:58,941
They would go buy all these drunks out 
of jail and they had bunk houses in the 

485
00:19:58,941 --> 00:20:00,270
back and the dishwashers asleep back 
there.

486
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:04,020
They'd drink all the half drinks that 
came back and crash there.

487
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:06,810
So I really,
at 17 years old I was thinking,

488
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:08,080
well,
I could,

489
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,150
uh,
when I'm 17,

490
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,650
I joined the 16.
I joined the merchant marines at 17,

491
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,840
which was wrong.
And uh,

492
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:20,841
and then I worked there until I retired 
and then I go wash dishes until a dine 

493
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:25,220
that bog house.
He liked the old drug that used to roll 

494
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,040
his joint so we couldn't roll joints 
very good.

495
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,930
And this guy could.
And we came in there one day.

496
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,570
Just data that you be.
Isn't it funny when he was dead,

497
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,070
that will have cirrhosis a problem.

498
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,830
These guys were bad.
I mean bad booze hound,

499
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,250
but you know,
pretty good dishwashers.

500
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,160
Isn't it funny when you look back in 
your life and getting kicked out of high

501
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:48,161
school,
all the trouble you were in getting 

502
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:48,280
kicked out of the navy,
getting bombed by a bunch of dudes.

503
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:53,281
Accidentally.
It's all the recipes or being a great 

504
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:53,281
comic,
but nobody ever looks at it that way.

505
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,380
You don't have some of that stuff are 
there.

506
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,290
What are you getting?
What are you going to ride around?

507
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,300
He needs almost like you have to come up
to everybody who is a fuck up and go,

508
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,920
look,
I know you're not fitting in here,

509
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,570
but there's a place where you do like 
there's a place to sit.

510
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,360
There's a fucking whole clan of us just 
kind of.

511
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,540
You've got to figure out how to do it.
I'm telling you,

512
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,470
Joe's first time I walked on stage,
I literally,

513
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:15,430
I went to myself.

514
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,890
I'm A.
I'm a fucking comedian.

515
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,790
Why didn't somebody tell me I could have
avoided a bunch of that other stuff and 

516
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,210
just started.
I was 29 when I figured it out.

517
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,000
Twenty one.
Same feeling right after I did it.

518
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:29,350
I was like,
this is it.

519
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,640
I found it.
This is it.

520
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,420
This is the one that works.
Yeah.

521
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,510
I mean I wasn't good.
I knew it wasn't good.

522
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,820
I knew I was like,
there's a lot of work to be done,

523
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,770
but I'm like,
this could be my job.

524
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:43,771
I go,
I didn't think I'd ever do it 

525
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:43,771
professionally or anything like that.
I just knew I was a comic,

526
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:44,650
you know,
that knew I was a comedian and.

527
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,240
But I never ever saw all this fame and 
fortune shit coming.

528
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,420
I mean,
I never really sat around asking the 

529
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,420
universe for it.
I never thought it would happen.

530
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,740
Even though I watched it happen to 
Foxworthy,

531
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,760
you know,
he biggest selling comic of all time by 

532
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,380
a lot.
So more records than prior and cod.

533
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,430
We combined and he blew up standing 
right next to me,

534
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:09,190
but I never gave it one second of 
thought that it would happen to me.

535
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,360
Well,
in the blue collar tort kicked off and 

536
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,360
then,
and then it took off for you.

537
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,360
How old were you?

538
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,870
Let's see.
Probably 45 or so.

539
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:24,871
40th five or 46.
So you just working as a comic up to 45 

540
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:28,711
and then 16 years clubs 50 weeks a year.
I'm doing nine shows a week.

541
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,270
So,
which is how you get good at this,

542
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,170
you know,
that's,

543
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,780
that's the best way to do it.
Not,

544
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,100
not here.
We're out there working,

545
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,570
you know,
different crowds and,

546
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,760
and then uh,
Jeff,

547
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,380
you know,
sign me up for this thing.

548
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,090
And uh,
first time I heard the idea,

549
00:22:43,091 --> 00:22:47,140
I told him that's retarded.
That's how smart I am.

550
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,680
And um,
they uh,

551
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:55,681
the,
the whole clincher to my career is 

552
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:57,040
warner brothers decided to make a movie 
out of that thing and uh,

553
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,850
and I didn't even see that.
I mean I had a gang war road is going to

554
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:04,140
make a movie out of it and Kathleen 
Madigan's fallen out of her chair.

555
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,740
They're gonna cheat.
What I'm like,

556
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:06,460
yeah,
that's what they say.

557
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,060
But I'd had no idea what that meant.
I don't know.

558
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:12,810
I'm an idiot from northwest Texas,
so I'm like,

559
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,820
it sounds good,
but then if for some reason they just 

560
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:23,350
tested it was really well liked across 
the board and uh,

561
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:28,530
and uh,
and then it was one of the biggest 

562
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:28,600
selling comedy albums of all time for 
dvds,

563
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,670
4 million copies.
It was giant.

564
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:33,460
I remember when it came out,
it was just one of those things like,

565
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:34,780
whoa,
nobody ever did that before.

566
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,110
Nobody ever put together a bunch of 
killers and then did a movie.

567
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,860
Wow.
They'd actually the kings of Comedy da 

568
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:43,860
and get him first.
Yeah,

569
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,770
we totally ripped off the black man 
again,

570
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,900
you know,
goddammit ron white the a way,

571
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,580
but,
you know,

572
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,520
it was just a blue collar,
a shot at it.

573
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,840
Not necessarily,
you know,

574
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:55,370
redneck but,
but you know,

575
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:57,980
just people that work for a living.
They lots who likes us,

576
00:23:57,981 --> 00:23:59,930
you know,
and,

577
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,140
but the catalyst from that we made Dan 
Whitney ridiculously famous and uh,

578
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,250
and made me famous and did a lot for 
bill,

579
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,080
but jeff was already,
you know,

580
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:14,120
Jeff.
So do you call Dan Whitney?

581
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,350
Dan Whitney,
or do you call him Larry?

582
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:19,360
The cable guy ever call my pain Larry,
uh,

583
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,530
though I don't call him Larry.
I don't know if you know him forever is 

584
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:24,530
Dan.
Yeah.

585
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,130
Yeah.
But you know what?

586
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:30,131
I never knew.
I never saw the act that it wasn't all 

587
00:24:30,131 --> 00:24:30,170
Larry the cable guy and I know it used 
to be.

588
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,740
And uh,
one of the funniest things I ever saw 

589
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:35,740
was that there was,
used to be this tape and uh,

590
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:41,030
uh,
the South County funnybone in St Louis 

591
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,840
and the condo where they literally 
shitty little apartment they put us in 

592
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,560
and it was a,
it was called bovine women from 

593
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,580
somewhere and it was about huge fat 
girls and uh,

594
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,830
and he had stayed,
it was a copy.

595
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,720
It had been around for awhile,
the condo.

596
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:56,360
So we play it for people as a joke when 
they came over and,

597
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,410
and uh,
he had a vhs camera and because that was

598
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:05,411
a copy,
he edited himself into the movie and it 

599
00:25:05,411 --> 00:25:07,970
was fucking outrageous.
Really funny.

600
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,310
So was it a porn that was a yarn.
Yeah.

601
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:12,680
And so somebody be fucking her from 
behind.

602
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:16,180
And then it turned the camera around in 
his day and just work.

603
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,050
This can be you,
Marty,

604
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:21,050
the manager of the club.
But it was very,

605
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:22,040
very funny.
Maybe me,

606
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:27,120
somebody stole it after that.
Nobody wants to steal it before it was 

607
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,120
edited,
but somebody took it after that.

608
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,150
Uh,
yeah.

609
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,750
That was back when you need to edit 
things.

610
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:33,140
You used to have to have two vcrs 
whereas to have a little bit of this and

611
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:35,270
a little bit of that and go back and 
forth and back and forth.

612
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,030
Yeah.
But those vhs cameras at the end,

613
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,620
you know,
because I had one too.

614
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,340
I used to type nearly everything I did.
And,

615
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,380
and uh,
so,

616
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,440
you know,
they,

617
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,740
if it didn't have a tab broken off of 
it,

618
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,840
you know,
you could just record right over 

619
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:53,840
whatever little part of it you wanted it
to.

620
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,110
And that's right.
The Tab.

621
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,790
If it had a tab,
you couldn't do it.

622
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:58,010
So that's what you did for your wedding 
video.

623
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,820
I forgot about that tab.
Like if you took the tab off then nobody

624
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:04,430
could record on.
It was still there.

625
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,020
And this one was still there,
so he just,

626
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,400
he just punched himself right into it.
The first thing is this big old 500 

627
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,970
pounder.
She's opening the refrigerator door.

628
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:18,971
So the reveal is the light of the 
frigerator through her thighs and in 

629
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,750
gigantic and it's a cutaway to him 
drinking a glass of milk,

630
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,760
going real slap sticky stuff.

631
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,280
But if you're working,
if you didn't see a covenant,

632
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:29,010
it was uh,
it was,

633
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:34,060
it was a big laugh.
I saw a video of him doing standup as 

634
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,550
Dan Whitney and I was like,
wow,

635
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,950
this is so weird.
Yeah.

636
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,610
So he had no shirt tucked in his pants.
He had like a polo shirt on,

637
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:41,840
right?
The whole deal.

638
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,100
And it was a,
was really smart.

639
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,060
I mean,
what he did.

640
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,530
And,
and uh,

641
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,270
you know,
one day,

642
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:50,250
one time Larry was just a character that
he did in the act.

643
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:52,260
And then the,
then the billingsley Larry took over.

644
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,940
That's like the dice man.
Yeah,

645
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:59,110
same thing because he was a,
he was a character that he did in the 

646
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,110
show.
Yeah,

647
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,621
he was Andrew Silverstein.
He would go on stage as Andrew 

648
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:02,621
Silverstein and he had a bunch of 
impressions that he would do.

649
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,650
He'd do an impression of Travolta,
he would do an Alpha Chino impression,

650
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,590
and then at the end of his act he would 
do the iceman.

651
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:15,430
The iceman was essentially aversion his,
his take on Jerry Lewis and the nutty 

652
00:27:16,371 --> 00:27:21,371
professor.
Remember when Jerry Lewis and the nutty 

653
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:23,291
professor and he was like this nerdy guy
and he'd drink some fucking potion and 

654
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:23,780
all of a sudden it becomes this really 
cool guy.

655
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Like that was what Andrew did.
He had just become this dice Mande 

656
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,580
character and you put the leather jacket
on.

657
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,560
Oh.
And then the rhymes and all that shit.

658
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,250
Right.
And his act was so unique because he was

659
00:27:37,251 --> 00:27:41,080
the first guy where you could repeat the
punchlines pack and everybody liked it.

660
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:42,590
Almost like a,
like a song,

661
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,960
right?
Like if someone's singing a song,

662
00:27:44,961 --> 00:27:49,010
you like to sing along,
but if for comedy that.

663
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,010
Because there's no such thing as they 
hit joke,

664
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,270
right?
There's a popular bid,

665
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,990
but there's no such thing as a hit job 
or want to hear to get,

666
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,840
you know,
the joke,

667
00:27:57,841 --> 00:28:00,090
you know the joke and fans,
you know,

668
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:05,091
they,
they bitch at me because I won't do 

669
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:05,091
anything that's old and,
and uh,

670
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:08,760
they want me to,
they want to hear me do tater salad and 

671
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:08,760
they want to hear.
We do some of that stuff.

672
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,801
But there are long bits,
there are long stories they already 

673
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:12,801
know.
So if I start one,

674
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:14,940
I did it in Madison Square Garden last 
time I was there,

675
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,590
I opened with it.
Oh really?

676
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:21,591
I hadn't done in 12 years.
I had to go back and listen to it 10 

677
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:21,591
times because there's a complicated 
piece of comedy.

678
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:23,520
It doesn't sound like it,
but it is,

679
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:28,521
you know,
it still pays rhythm and timing all the 

680
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:28,980
way through this eight minute long joke 
or story.

681
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,420
And so I did it and they,
when I started it,

682
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,570
you thought I was one of the Beatles.
They would just went absolutely nuts.

683
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,390
But then I got to drag them through an 
eight minute long piece.

684
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:41,790
They already know.
So now they're not,

685
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,800
you know,
it's not the response I used to get that

686
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:46,260
I love to get from it.
So if I don't get what I want,

687
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,390
then you don't get what you want.
So.

688
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,770
But it was fun to do that one time,
but that I just won't go back.

689
00:28:52,771 --> 00:28:56,490
And you know,
Gaffigan is a prisoner to hot pockets or

690
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,280
he's in prison.
That's a good prison to be in.

691
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,720
It's a great president being it's funny 
guy,

692
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:03,930
but he has to do that bit like a Fox 
foxworthy has to do the,

693
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:06,570
you might be a redneck buddies also got 
10,000

694
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:08,160
of them.
That's fine.

695
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:08,880
No,
that's different.

696
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:13,881
He's got so many versions of it.
We have many only does five or six at 

697
00:29:13,881 --> 00:29:17,091
the end of the show and that's been for 
years that he hasn't hardly done any of 

698
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:17,640
that and that's what he was always known
for.

699
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:23,210
And uh,
which was just a great idea for a bit 

700
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,260
that now has calendars and you know,
just crazy,

701
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,150
crazy the money made off.
That was a genius pit.

702
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:33,770
He just nailed it.
He figured out like this perfect 

703
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:33,770
formula.
Yeah,

704
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,380
he's a funny guy,
man.

705
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,390
Jeff Foxworthy does not get the credit 
he deserved.

706
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:37,350
No,
no.

707
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:41,860
He's probably the most prolific a writer
that I know

708
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,100
and I also just owe him fucking 
everything.

709
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,460
You know,
really nice guy too.

710
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:52,461
He is a sweetheart of a man.
Humble takes his kids to school every 

711
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,160
day,
goes to church,

712
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:56,440
has a mission project that he works on.
Very,

713
00:29:56,441 --> 00:30:01,441
very straight.
It was a little wilder when he was in 

714
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:01,441
the club,
you know,

715
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:01,700
but,
but that's the way he was raised in.

716
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,330
That's kind of what he went back to.
Where does he live?

717
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,520
In Georgia?
In Atlanta.

718
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,820
While we had a house the size.
What college.

719
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,770
I'm sure I'm not talking about this 
University of Phoenix shit either.

720
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,280
I'm talking about.

721
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,350
Yeah,
that's,

722
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,090
you kind of have to buy one of those 
when you get that rich.

723
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,350
Well,
you know,

724
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,110
he's uh,
he's just a,

725
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,130
he's just the real deal,
you know,

726
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,200
and,
but you're right.

727
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,110
If people of randomly,
if I hear you got other comics,

728
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,870
you know,
sometimes they'll rag on the blue collar

729
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,680
tour,
you know,

730
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,740
a lot of people didn't like Dan and I 
mean,

731
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:41,280
but it was all comics and I've never 
performed for comics once in my life and

732
00:30:41,281 --> 00:30:43,500
I tell the comics,
here's the worst thing you can do,

733
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:48,501
perform for those comics in the back 
because that's not whoever's going to 

734
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:49,230
come up with I see you or pay money,
don't perform for them,

735
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,050
but for,
for those people in the seats and so you

736
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:54,080
know,
it it and whatever it was,

737
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:59,090
whatever it was,
and he just got popular and if it 

738
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,090
wouldn't have been for that huge 
popularity,

739
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,090
nobody would have given a shit.

740
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:04,810
That thing that happens when something 
becomes really popular is that people 

741
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,480
decided to shit on it.
Even though it doesn't mean like there's

742
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:07,640
nothing wrong with Larry.
The Cable Guy's act.

743
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:10,430
It's a funny act.
He's a funny guy and he's a paced rhythm

744
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:12,350
and timing comic and he's really good 
at.

745
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:15,440
He's very good at it,
but I remember when he was huge,

746
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,520
when he still is,
but when it was all happening when it 

747
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,290
was first happening and he was doing 
fucking football arenas,

748
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,620
all these,
like a David Cross wrote some fucking 

749
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:26,620
letter to Larry the cable guy and I'm 
like,

750
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,790
what are you doing?
Like this doesn't make any sense.

751
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:29,960
Like,
what is he doing wrong?

752
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,550
Like,
I don't understand.

753
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,470
What are you trying to say that this 
character,

754
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:37,610
this ridiculous over the top character 
he's doing isn't funny or racist or

755
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,860
people that really took issue with it.
And it's just this,

756
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:42,330
just comedy.
If you don't lack it,

757
00:31:42,331 --> 00:31:43,450
listen to something else.
Yeah,

758
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,900
exactly.
That's the end of the long and the short

759
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:46,610
of it,
uh,

760
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,300
it,
you know,

761
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:52,370
it's not exactly my cup of tea,
but I know how good he is still a,

762
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,710
you know.
And,

763
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:55,280
and,
uh,

764
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:01,130
I would go out of my way to see jeff and
I probably wouldn't go out of my way to 

765
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:01,230
see him just to see,
um,

766
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:01,980
but,
uh,

767
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,490
but that his style is not exactly my cup
of tea,

768
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:10,491
but that doesn't matter,
that I can still see how good he is at 

769
00:32:10,491 --> 00:32:14,121
it and uh,
and saw what he did and the impact that 

770
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:14,730
he had.
And then also the addition.

771
00:32:14,731 --> 00:32:16,980
He wasn't one of the original guys,
the other,

772
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:21,150
there was another guy and then jeff got 
a got rid of him.

773
00:32:21,151 --> 00:32:24,420
And who's the other guy you don't 
remember?

774
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,580
Nah.
Okay.

775
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,320
I can remember.
I know I totally would say,

776
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:33,321
but it was a guy from.
I just have a shitty memory sometimes I 

777
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:35,340
could remember his name and sometimes I 
can't remember his name,

778
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,590
but he's the last beetle.
He's that last beetle,

779
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:40,160
that one kind of get kicked out of the 
box and fucking to this day

780
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,650
beat his head against the wall.
I don't know what he does now,

781
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:44,510
but uh,
he was a good comic and,

782
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:49,530
but he was on some kind of medication 
that made him just getting Jeff's face 

783
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,870
and talk to him nonstop.
Doesn't like that.

784
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,450
And Jeff's like,
Hey,

785
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:56,030
I know I'm taking a piss dude.
GimMe a minute.

786
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,320
Oh No.
Adderall type things.

787
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,280
I guess so.
And then he would,

788
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,230
you know,
we're doing these big shows.

789
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:03,620
They're like,
well,

790
00:33:03,621 --> 00:33:06,530
I put $12 on a cab and nobody's paying 
me back.

791
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:08,140
And,
and uh,

792
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,210
read you your right about 12 bucks.
Wow.

793
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:15,710
That's the wrong guy.
Right.

794
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,860
So,
and then Dan came in and shook things 

795
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:20,860
up,
you know,

796
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:20,860
and,
and,

797
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:20,860
uh,
really,

798
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,490
you know,
like it don't,

799
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:27,491
like it doesn't matter.
He destroyed every night and still 

800
00:33:27,491 --> 00:33:28,810
involved to the stairs.
Yes,

801
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,800
we'd audition for the same part in the 
movie,

802
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,380
uh,
in the not too long ago.

803
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,440
So I saw him at this audition and it was
for a,

804
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,740
I don't remember the name of the movie,
but it was supposed to a huge cast.

805
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,700
Really big people in it.
But they're all sucked and I mean,

806
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:48,701
they're always just nothing in.
And then I got sideways with the people 

807
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:50,090
doing the interview because they said it
was a reading,

808
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:52,040
so I didn't memorize the script,
you know,

809
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:55,700
and I came in,
but I wear these tinted yellow glasses a

810
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,460
lot of the time.
And uh,

811
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,220
she,
she said,

812
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:00,220
can you take off the glasses?
They're too modern for this,

813
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,940
this piece.
I'm like,

814
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:04,820
well,
if you want me to read it,

815
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,480
the glasses are not for sure.
They just happened to be yellow.

816
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,130
But.
So whoever's watching it,

817
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,020
have them close their eyes and imagine 
with me with shitty glasses on,

818
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:16,760
if that's okay,
but I'm not going to take them off.

819
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,890
And then she goes,
well,

820
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,320
I guess if you,
if you get this role,

821
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:23,090
you'll cancel your lab schedule.
And I said,

822
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:23,780
no,
I won't.

823
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,070
No,
I won't.

824
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:26,180
That was cleared with them.
I said,

825
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:28,400
you got to where if I'm going to do it,
you got to do it around my schedule.

826
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:30,830
I'm not canceling any days for it.
And I'm like,

827
00:34:30,831 --> 00:34:35,831
Oh,
now I'm going to fight at the casting 

828
00:34:35,831 --> 00:34:35,831
office.
That probably not going to get this.

829
00:34:35,831 --> 00:34:37,760
I didn't want it anyway.
I'd just come off the roadies and then I

830
00:34:37,761 --> 00:34:40,300
was kind of disappointing.
So it's a fucking weird

831
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,510
businessman and that,
that,

832
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,520
that inner.
The interaction that you have with the 

833
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:46,520
casting director is very strange.
I've had some good ones are really,

834
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,350
really nice conversation.

835
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:52,610
People want me to.
Gail have been his boot cast me for 

836
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,191
Brodis and she's wonderful,
but there's a lot of them that are 

837
00:34:55,191 --> 00:34:56,040
wonderful,
but there's a lot of them that are not.

838
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,410
These two chicks were.
There were snobs.

839
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,390
Yeah.
I mean they,

840
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,090
they really were,
you know,

841
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,100
they were really talking to me like I 
had not accomplished a single thing in 

842
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,120
my life and maybe if this happened,
you know,

843
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,820
I'd be able to call myself a man or.

844
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,260
Well that's their rule.
I mean that's their position,

845
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:16,570
their positions.
That's one of the reasons why actors are

846
00:35:16,571 --> 00:35:20,020
so fucking crazy.
It's because you walk into this room and

847
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:23,320
your life depends on whether or not this
person puts a check next to your name,

848
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:28,321
whether they gave you the green light,
and so you go in there and you have to 

849
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:30,640
memorize some bullshit that you don't 
really care about most of the time.

850
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:35,641
Some nonsense Sitcom or some fucking 
stupid rail and a movie and you gotta 

851
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:38,070
it's half charming them half doing

852
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:43,070
this.
I tell Brian to this day that they have 

853
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:43,070
fucking ruined them.
I go ruined them.

854
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:47,670
You,
you don't know how to disagree with 

855
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,670
people.
I'm like,

856
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,670
Brian Cowen will go into Rodney's 
charms.

857
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,740
Everyone in the building because he's so
good at an audition.

858
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:50,910
So I'm like,
they fucking ruined you.

859
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,540
You don't know how to like figure out 
that this person is not for you.

860
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,250
Well,
you know,

861
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:56,640
now

862
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,460
I just turned 60 and on a Sunday.
And uh,

863
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,260
if I had to,
if I signed up for a TV show,

864
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:08,530
I'd be signed on until I was 66 or 67.
And uh,

865
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:13,540
in my day that if 51.
And so that seems like an awful long 

866
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:15,390
time.
And so if it,

867
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:21,100
I mean,
if it happened to be someone I really 

868
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:21,100
liked,
you know,

869
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,350
like if,
if Jay Mcgraw was producing it,

870
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:27,470
I would do it,
probably would do it just so I could 

871
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:27,470
hang out with him,
but I would have to really,

872
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,220
really like somebody,
you know,

873
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:32,010
that I was going to be hanging with that
time because I couldn't just

874
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,850
do it.
Don't ever guest is Dr.

875
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,800
Phil's kid is such a cool motherfucker.
Well you have a mutual friend,

876
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,340
Shane Mcgraw who's a buddy of ours,
both of us.

877
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,650
He's a fucking coolest guy.

878
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,530
Yeah,
he is.

879
00:36:45,531 --> 00:36:46,760
He's,
he's something else.

880
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,000
So is his dad.
His Dad is his dad is a hoot.

881
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,730
I'm sure he is.
But who would have ever guessed it?

882
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,410
Nobody.
Why?

883
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:58,070
I'm friends with both of them and they,
but a jay is just solid.

884
00:36:58,071 --> 00:36:58,540
I mean

885
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,090
the,
uh,

886
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,510
I can't even tell you some things he's 
done for me to start crying.

887
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,730
Don't cry.
I cry.

888
00:37:06,731 --> 00:37:09,430
So don't do it.
Don't do it.

889
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,760
So,
uh,

890
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,970
I don't cry for sad thing.
So I'm aware.

891
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,740
I'm weird.
Like sad things,

892
00:37:14,741 --> 00:37:19,030
I can sort of deal with some weird way,
but when things are epic,

893
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,830
like epic moments,
I'm like,

894
00:37:20,831 --> 00:37:22,120
Holy Shit,
don't cry bitch.

895
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,150
Right together

896
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,600
like a Nadia Comaneci.
It's doing those little back flips out 

897
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,550
of cried like a bit.
Excellence is a,

898
00:37:31,551 --> 00:37:33,880
his chokes me up a bit,
but you know,

899
00:37:33,881 --> 00:37:38,500
my friend died last weekend and uh,
and that kind of stuff.

900
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,030
I'm okay with.
I mean,

901
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,940
I don't,
I don't,

902
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,060
I don't get real emotional about that 
kind of stuff.

903
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,010
Uh,
unless,

904
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:50,110
you know,
unless I've known you for 50 years and 

905
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:50,110
uh,
so,

906
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,420
you know,
but uh,

907
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,290
j Jay,
Jay's just a great guy,

908
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:58,350
you know,
he's an unbelievably solid dude when he 

909
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,020
doesn't have to be.
He just brought me back a three boxes of

910
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,720
killer cigars from Cuba.
So how can you not like it?

911
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,940
Oh yeah.
He just went to Cuba.

912
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:04,710
You can bring those back now.
Yeah,

913
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,780
I,
yeah,

914
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,140
I think,
I think he was on his plane or 

915
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,140
something.
Yes,

916
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,480
you can kind of do it.
You can kind of bring them back sorta.

917
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,520
You can get like a few of them.
Well,

918
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:19,521
they,
the thing is that you can get $200 

919
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:22,851
worth,
but the people that customers have no 

920
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:24,411
idea how expensive they are,
so you can just say this was $185 worth 

921
00:38:24,691 --> 00:38:25,630
and they go,
Ooh,

922
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,110
that's expensive,
but it's really $1,500

923
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:29,400
worth of cigars.
Yeah,

924
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:31,170
I mean if you pay them in American 
money,

925
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:32,970
it probably is 150 bucks worth.
Right.

926
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,740
I can probably pretty good.
I actually,

927
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:36,100
they probably

928
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,830
know they're really not.
Well,

929
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,860
I don't know,
didn't I didn't ask him but because he 

930
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:43,860
gave them to me.
But uh,

931
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,450
you get a deal on him.
How often do you smoke cigars?

932
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,490
Uh,
you know,

933
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,570
every day as I smoked,
when I smoked,

934
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,760
I saw you walked in with one.
I was like,

935
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,690
God dammit.
Ron White,

936
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:54,790
you're a fucking caricature.
Look at what do you got there?

937
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,830
That's one of the,
one of the gaming these,

938
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:57,720
uh,
boulevard.

939
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,080
It was a good.
That's a strong one.

940
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,330
Yeah it is.
And it's.

941
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,090
And it was that big when I started so I 
just smoked it and cut it off.

942
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,530
It does.
That's a strong cigar.

943
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,910
I liked boulevard,
I'm going to,

944
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,750
I'm going to crank a crank that back up 
if there's still air in my tire whenever

945
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:11,570
I get out of here.

946
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,780
Boulevards and.
Well,

947
00:39:14,781 --> 00:39:18,260
it's something about that soil.
There's this one area of Cuba where they

948
00:39:18,261 --> 00:39:21,440
grow most of their tobacco and it's like
some,

949
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:25,250
it's not even that big of a place.
It's not like that many acres,

950
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,100
right?
Just this unbelievable soil.

951
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:33,790
Like what is it that much different,
like you will like a sore or are you 

952
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:33,790
like a Sim?
All,

953
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,490
Yay.
Of Cigar,

954
00:39:34,491 --> 00:39:35,060
sort of.

955
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,860
Yeah.
You know,

956
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,550
a,
a,

957
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,080
you know,
the,

958
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:41,530
the thing is that the smart guy was,
you know,

959
00:39:41,531 --> 00:39:46,531
Davidoff Davidoff cigars and because he 
saw that he saw it all coming.

960
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:49,240
And uh,
so before it all happened,

961
00:39:49,241 --> 00:39:53,410
he moved his rollers and his factory and
everything over the Dominican Republic.

962
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:59,340
So whenever they came in and took the 
land from those people that started 

963
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,081
these iconic brands and they just kicked
him out of the country with nothing,

964
00:40:04,481 --> 00:40:08,500
will they all had seed so they could 
grow that same tobacco if they stayed in

965
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:13,501
the same kind of region,
the same parallel like Dominican 

966
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:14,590
Republic or even over to Ecuador.
Uh,

967
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:16,540
that was still perfect conditions for 
growing these,

968
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,010
these,
these plants.

969
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,940
But what they didn't have was rollers 
and uh,

970
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,420
these cigars,
uh,

971
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,610
these handmade cigars are rolled by 
experts.

972
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,940
I mean these people in Cuba,
they spend their whole lives.

973
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:32,941
It's a good job and they have these huge
role in rooms and these people just 

974
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:36,790
rollies perfect cigars and somebody sits
in the front of the room and read them 

975
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,250
books.
Really read some books.

976
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,170
Yeah,
the reads like a book on tape,

977
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:46,171
but someone's Ds.
If somebody is actually up there with 

978
00:40:46,171 --> 00:40:46,171
the reader,
they come in and shifts and,

979
00:40:46,171 --> 00:40:48,340
and read to them.
They sit there and listen to the stories

980
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:49,280
and roll cigars.

981
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,660
Fucking fascinating.
I have a book at home.

982
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:56,870
It's all photographs of a Cuban Cuban 
cigar business and the Cuban people 

983
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,560
rolling the cigars and it's fucking 
amazing.

984
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,320
They're smoking a fat cigar while 
they're rolling cigars,

985
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,300
you know,
and the whole thing is just,

986
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,320
it's got such a weird sort of romance to
it.

987
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,470
Yeah,
yeah.

988
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,850
There we go.
I used to smoke a,

989
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:17,851
you know,
a couple of them a day and I always 

990
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:17,851
spoke on stage so.
But actually now I'm,

991
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:20,380
I'm such a dinosaur.
They're really starting to crack down on

992
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:21,350
the.
Oh,

993
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,470
the cigar,
so I'll just lie it and I'll take it out

994
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:25,760
there and put an ashtray,
let it go out and do the suction because

995
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:28,120
like the theaters will let you smoke in 
the theater.

996
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,430
But they used to give me some wiggle 
room.

997
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,590
But now like in Canada,
they started saying,

998
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,100
well,
here's

999
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,100
what we do.
We don't know what we're going to find 

1000
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,841
you,
but we're going to hold all of your 

1001
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:40,841
money until we decide if you smoke on 
this stage.

1002
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:43,270
They told you that before you went out 
the buzz kill.

1003
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:47,540
Well,
I'm glad they didn't tell me after Jesus

1004
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,840
fucking Christ,
but someplaces Massey Hall in Toronto,

1005
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:55,841
you know,
that's fucking Charlie Chaplin was on 

1006
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:55,841
that stage.
I just loved that place.

1007
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:56,940
Great.
Toronto.

1008
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,740
Toronto's incredible.
I just did it two weeks ago with Russell

1009
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,250
Peters,
me,

1010
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:04,670
Russell and big joker son fellow.
What a fucking show.

1011
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,370
I don't even know if I've seen Jay.
I've ever met him.

1012
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,500
He's funny dad and I've heard him on 
radio.

1013
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,320
Right?
He's got a radio show and podcast.

1014
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,340
Legion of skanks.
Yeah,

1015
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,230
one of the greatest names for podcast 
ever.

1016
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,820
He's a funny dude.
He's a good dude too.

1017
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,360
And just end it again.

1018
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,390
Another one like a real comic,
like you know,

1019
00:42:22,391 --> 00:42:23,910
like you know one when you meet one.
Yeah,

1020
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,930
sure.
You know like if I ran into him 

1021
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:28,930
anywhere,
be like a,

1022
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:29,270
like a life vest in the middle of the 
ocean.

1023
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:31,280
If I ran into him in Dubai,
I'd be like,

1024
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,510
there's,
there's one of us.

1025
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,130
Okay.
All right.

1026
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,950
I could go with you to the pathway 
there,

1027
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:39,260
but not to Dubai.
You might go buy now.

1028
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,560
No.
You know what's up buddy?

1029
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,620
I'm not sure that I wouldn't somebody 
people talk about this huge,

1030
00:42:45,621 --> 00:42:50,621
huge money that they're offering guys to
go out to Dubai and in India they got 

1031
00:42:50,621 --> 00:42:52,940
crazy rules though in Dubai.
They do.

1032
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,680
Yeah.
Yeah,

1033
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,540
yeah.
Dubai is a crazy religious rules like if

1034
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:59,570
you in any way insult royal families or 
in any way.

1035
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,580
Who was it,
Jamie that's talked about?

1036
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:04,910
That was it.
I think it was how sparks was telling us

1037
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:09,911
that he did a Gig in Dubai and someone 
after he got off stage told him to do.

1038
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:15,490
He's going to be arrested for something 
that he said because he referred to one 

1039
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:20,170
of the royal family as like Sir rather 
than your highness.

1040
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,170
Like something as simple as that.
Yeah,

1041
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,310
I better not go,
fuck that.

1042
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,470
I can't do it.
I can just,

1043
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,420
I can,
I,

1044
00:43:27,421 --> 00:43:29,910
I won't do colleges.
I won't do anything either.

1045
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:35,230
Five years.
Seinfeld bitching about the political 

1046
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:35,540
correctness of a college students these 
days.

1047
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:37,130
I'm like,
why don't you go perform for people your

1048
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:38,950
own age?
Maybe that's.

1049
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,140
Maybe that's it.
The universe.

1050
00:43:41,141 --> 00:43:43,180
Think about that.
Well,

1051
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,610
it's not your people and they're super 
sensitive and they're just,

1052
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,800
they're finally disconnected from their 
parents that are looking to call 

1053
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,491
bullshit on everybody there.
That's one thing about college kids is 

1054
00:43:54,491 --> 00:43:57,520
they're looking to be right and they're 
looking to establish what you can and 

1055
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,480
can't say and they're looking to control
people because they have.

1056
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:02,030
They're just free for the first time 
ever themselves.

1057
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:07,510
Right.
It probably would have done the same 

1058
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:07,510
thing.
Yeah.

1059
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,840
If I hadn't gotten kicked out of high 
school and joined the navy,

1060
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:10,900
I pro.
I just,

1061
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,990
uh,
I can't do like regular school work that

1062
00:44:13,991 --> 00:44:15,920
I can't do that kind of stuff.
I've never owned a notebook.

1063
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:21,220
This isn't mine.
This is your habit that's for you to 

1064
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,530
gift like Christmas.
It's very nice.

1065
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,770
Christmas.
You don't write down on notebooks.

1066
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,490
He just,
uh,

1067
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,710
you just come up stuff on stage or you 
come up with stuff.

1068
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,380
Do you like if you have an idea where 
you write it on your phone or something?

1069
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:31,700
No,

1070
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:37,550
no.
I have my attention deficit disorder so 

1071
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,760
bad that if I pick up a piece of paper,
I'm done,

1072
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,680
then I'll start thinking about that 
piece of paper and then I'm off to 

1073
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,860
fucking ag land and so it just doesn't 
work.

1074
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:50,670
And uh,
I've forgotten so much stuff I know that

1075
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:52,470
I could have done on stage and,
and uh,

1076
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,290
but,
but once it gets to the stage,

1077
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,500
I record it.
So I don't.

1078
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,250
And I should record these,
these,

1079
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,050
these short sets,
but I don't.

1080
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,770
But I record all the big sites.
You don't record like the comedy store.

1081
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,200
I can do it on your phone,
you know?

1082
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,490
Yeah.
Well,

1083
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,110
it's funny.
Now that's another thing.

1084
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:11,400
I don't,
I don't know a lot about that.

1085
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,690
Have a look.
See this.

1086
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,910
It's so fucking easy.
See this little thing right here.

1087
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:17,250
This is a voice.
Recordings like that.

1088
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:21,060
These are all my sets for the last six 
months.

1089
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:23,070
Just keep going.
You got to put it all.

1090
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,650
And I make notes.
Make notes for each one of them.

1091
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,870
Did you know you have it?
You have it on your phone.

1092
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,100
It's a,
it's an application that comes with it.

1093
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:32,640
It's called voice memos.
It comes with the phone.

1094
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,740
So you have an iphone.
It's in there.

1095
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,070
I'll show you afterwards.
I'll help you,

1096
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,570
but it's so easy,
so easy.

1097
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:38,910
Ron,
you just take that sucker.

1098
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:40,740
You press record as you're walking up 
the stage.

1099
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:45,720
I sit on the stool right by me records 
my whole set because there's many,

1100
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:49,030
many times that I'd have a new punchline
or a new outline.

1101
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,410
I'll have a thought in the middle of a 
bit mobile and one.

1102
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:56,420
What the fuck is that?
And I'll go off on something just free 

1103
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,920
and I'll say afterwards,
thank God I recorded that because I got 

1104
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,100
to go listen to that because for me this
store in particular,

1105
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:05,310
it's the best place for that.
And the Ice House.

1106
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,210
You have to do the Ice House?

1107
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,580
No,
fuck.

1108
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:12,620
You could have done it before but uh,
but I should get over there and they 

1109
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,080
have like an open mic or something or 
the.

1110
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:18,460
Well they have a bunch of shit there but
we do shows there on Wednesdays all the 

1111
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,520
time.
I'm there like January.

1112
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,070
I think January fourth or something like
that,

1113
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,010
that it January fourth.
You want to do it with us?

1114
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:28,880
It's always sold out and it's the 
fucking best room in the world.

1115
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,030
That room,
the ice house room is set up.

1116
00:46:32,031 --> 00:46:34,790
It's the best setup on our.
You will fucking murder that place.

1117
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,870
I've,
I've done sets there a long time ago.

1118
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,370
Uh,
and uh,

1119
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,780
and,
and I,

1120
00:46:39,781 --> 00:46:41,430
and I know I loved it and everybody 
says,

1121
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,790
is this the best room?
There is

1122
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,120
comedy club in the world.
It is the oldest comedy club in the 

1123
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:48,120
world.
It started in 1961,

1124
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,230
I believe.
Nineteen 61.

1125
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,680
Nineteen 62,
something like that.

1126
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:56,150
Yeah.
It's the oldest concurrent working 

1127
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:56,950
comedy club on Earth.
And it used to literally be an ice house

1128
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:02,310
before they had freezers.
People used to buy ice from the Ice 

1129
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:03,220
House.
That's how fucking old that places.

1130
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:06,480
Yeah,
they on the fourth.

1131
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:07,140
I,
I'll,

1132
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:08,880
uh,
I'll come out there if you guys got room

1133
00:47:08,881 --> 00:47:11,700
for me gentlemen.
You want to do a show?

1134
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:12,570
Do it.
I got room for you.

1135
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,610
So have some fun.
Yeah,

1136
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:19,460
I'll browse Tequila.
I'll leave her out there with the,

1137
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,650
with a bottle of,
uh,

1138
00:47:20,651 --> 00:47:21,500
that extra nda.
Whoa.

1139
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,540
Now we're talking.
So you guys looked at a number one and 

1140
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:26,540
j.
u a n Tequila.

1141
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,110
That's what I've got to hock.
Yeah.

1142
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:33,111
Okay.
Well we're going to buy a case of that 

1143
00:47:33,111 --> 00:47:33,111
shit.
Bring it in here.

1144
00:47:33,111 --> 00:47:33,111
Set it up.
Boom.

1145
00:47:33,111 --> 00:47:34,120
You didn't,
you don't.

1146
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:38,050
They have it at the comedy store now.
I always have a bottle back there,

1147
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:41,470
but our distribution is just now getting
fixed and in California.

1148
00:47:41,471 --> 00:47:43,690
So there I'm sure that they'll pick it 
up.

1149
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,080
Uh,
as soon as these guys get all hooked up,

1150
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,210
they just got their Tequila the other 
day.

1151
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,610
So it's a dark tequila too.
You have,

1152
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,970
do you have more than one kind?
Yeah,

1153
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,240
I have a block.
Whoa.

1154
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,460
That's kind of straight out of the 
faucet and a and then an extra,

1155
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:02,461
uh,
than in a reposado which is a haze for 

1156
00:48:02,461 --> 00:48:06,840
nine months in two different barrels and
then blended at the end and have a 

1157
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,300
French oak wine barrel.
Half of it's a bourbon barrel,

1158
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:13,720
retired and then nine months and then 
blended together.

1159
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,010
And uh,
and that's,

1160
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,840
and that's what,
uh,

1161
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:21,870
my brother in law,
that's all he drinks is that one in and 

1162
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:22,150
I drink the other one because I come 
from a scotch background.

1163
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:23,410
So it's a little heavier.
Yeah,

1164
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:26,980
it's got like a dark sort of smoky.
It's dangerous.

1165
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,280
It's a dangerous bottle that have just 
sitting near you with no protection or 

1166
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,451
you know,
just with a couple people just because 

1167
00:48:36,451 --> 00:48:36,451
once you start drinking it,
it just,

1168
00:48:36,451 --> 00:48:38,860
it's just,
it offers no resistance at all.

1169
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:43,860
You can just sit there and Polish alibi 
feeling we shouldn't be having a 

1170
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:43,860
podcast,
but I have in like a little drink.

1171
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,160
Okay.
I feel like we should have a little 

1172
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,160
drink,
get some Jack Daniels on the,

1173
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,160
on the box.
Let's do it.

1174
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,490
A little drink with ron white and come 
on,

1175
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:52,600
come on,
come on.

1176
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,520
Yeah,
it's a good Tequila.

1177
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:55,830
I'm happy you're,
you're,

1178
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:57,730
uh,
you're doing that as well.

1179
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,520
It's nice to see comedians branch out 
into different shit.

1180
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:06,330
Well,
I'd like to see some of the different 

1181
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:06,330
stuff I do ever make money,
but you know,

1182
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:10,261
we,
we have a lot of fun with the Tequila 

1183
00:49:10,261 --> 00:49:10,261
and somebody will come by and buy it one
day and said,

1184
00:49:10,261 --> 00:49:10,690
you know,
we win everything with it.

1185
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,270
How's that not making money,
not making money.

1186
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,870
And now,
uh,

1187
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:18,430
again it made money.
The third year it made a,

1188
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:18,970
it made.

1189
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,970
We made the third year we made $17,000.
That's the whole year.

1190
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,550
And that was a possible,
uh,

1191
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:32,850
well,
because it's kind of expensive to get 

1192
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:32,850
into.
I mean we're,

1193
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:32,850
we're,
we're,

1194
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,190
we're shoestring and it,
you know,

1195
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:38,170
I'm not putting,
I'm not putting my nut in there,

1196
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,760
you know,
I put money in it but not,

1197
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,340
not too much.
And then,

1198
00:49:42,341 --> 00:49:42,870
so,
you know,

1199
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,920
we're just kind of as really slow 
growth,

1200
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:47,170
uh,
until somebody comes along,

1201
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,460
you know,
and then,

1202
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:49,600
uh,
and then if they,

1203
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,370
you know,
somebody wants it worse than we do,

1204
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:56,371
they'll have it.
So for you is just sort of like a goof 

1205
00:49:56,371 --> 00:49:56,371
just to get into it for fun.
A not.

1206
00:49:56,371 --> 00:50:01,010
Well,
a couple things I'd really like to see 

1207
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:03,091
my brother in law.
He had really like to see it work for 

1208
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:03,091
him.
Then he owns more of it than I do.

1209
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:04,320
And a mechanic,
right?

1210
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,700
Yeah.
I Alex from the window box very well.

1211
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:10,300
He's one of my best friends and he 
literally,

1212
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:14,410
when I started doing standup a September
17th,

1213
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:18,130
1986 is when I met him and I was nervous
I was going to do four minutes,

1214
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:23,280
first time open mic and went straight to
the bar and order a beer and a shot of 

1215
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,551
Tequila.
And he handed me the beer and a shot of 

1216
00:50:26,551 --> 00:50:28,381
Tequila.
So he was the bartender in the club I 

1217
00:50:28,381 --> 00:50:28,381
started at in

1218
00:50:28,381 --> 00:50:29,000
Arlington,
Texas.

1219
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,830
What's it called?
Funnybone comedy club.

1220
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,730
If they could say something else now.
But,

1221
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:36,910
but that's where,
that was my whole weight.

1222
00:50:36,911 --> 00:50:39,110
What's Arlington near Dallas?
Fort Worth?

1223
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,770
That's where Texas stadium is.
And uh,

1224
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:46,730
in the ballpark.
And where's that funnybone not funny,

1225
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:48,230
but an Improv.
They don't have an Improv.

1226
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,800
Know they have Improv,
uh,

1227
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:56,500
up in uh,
Irvine Irving or something up at North 

1228
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,500
Dallas.
There's one,

1229
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,490
but there isn't there too.
Yeah.

1230
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,370
All right.
What is this?

1231
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,360
This.
There used to be two.

1232
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:02,630
There used to be one right down on 
central expressway,

1233
00:51:02,631 --> 00:51:04,060
but I don't know if there is any more.

1234
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:08,790
This is a Sinatra select frankie baby.
Where did we get this?

1235
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,870
Somebody sent it to us,
right?

1236
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,440
The Jack Daniels Send Simon to us.
Yeah.

1237
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,260
Yeah.
Jack Daniels send this to us.

1238
00:51:13,261 --> 00:51:15,030
They found out we drank Jack Daniels on 
the show,

1239
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,040
so they sent us to Sinatra select tool.
Yeah,

1240
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:20,430
baby.
It's mostly toupees.

1241
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:26,520
Come on and cheers,
sir.

1242
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,170
Joe Rogan.
Cheers.

1243
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:33,171
Blonde White Jack Daniels to me means 
fun times and bad decisions.

1244
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:40,910
Almost everything that I've ever done 
that I should've done that a lot of it's

1245
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:42,900
connected to that shit.
There's just so much.

1246
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:46,230
Fuck it in Jack Daniel's.
It touched her slogan.

1247
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,550
Jack Daniels.
Fuck it.

1248
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,100
Fuck it.
Fuck it.

1249
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,130
It's like A.
almost every time I go on stage,

1250
00:51:53,131 --> 00:51:58,131
I have a shot shot shot of this.
Not the Sinatra stuff,

1251
00:51:58,231 --> 00:52:01,110
but kind of tastes the same to me.
I wasn't really.

1252
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,340
That's really pretty good.
I'm not much of a bourbon guy,

1253
00:52:05,341 --> 00:52:05,580
but that's

1254
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:10,600
pretty tasty stuff.
Finally,

1255
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:11,630
Weed's legal,
Ron White.

1256
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:13,610
I know you're happy about that.

1257
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:19,220
Well,
I've been treating it like it was 

1258
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,661
illegal for about 50 years,
so I had know it's going to have that 

1259
00:52:20,661 --> 00:52:22,820
much difference.
Uh,

1260
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:24,840
you know,
they had medical marijuana here anyway.

1261
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,260
And,
and uh,

1262
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:32,020
and I was actually using medical 
marijuana to get off of regular 

1263
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,791
marijuana and that works like a charm.
It's almost like Jesus came from heaven 

1264
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:39,741
and healed me of this regular marijuana 
problem that's been haunting me since I 

1265
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:43,881
was 13 years old.
And now that they've legalized 

1266
00:52:43,881 --> 00:52:47,151
recreational marijuana,
I'm going to use that to wean myself 

1267
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:48,120
from medical marijuana.
That's nine.

1268
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:53,130
I've got a plan that's like methadone.
You know what?

1269
00:52:53,131 --> 00:52:53,960
It's a,
it's,

1270
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,320
it's so it,
it came,

1271
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,840
it took so long to get here,
uh,

1272
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:00,660
you know,
to,

1273
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:02,540
to even this little seven,
what?

1274
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,640
We have seven states now that are a 
group,

1275
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:06,760
how many states?
Jamie,

1276
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,920
legal,
recreational.

1277
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,600
That was recreational,
but then a bunch of,

1278
00:53:12,601 --> 00:53:14,130
uh,
you know,

1279
00:53:14,131 --> 00:53:16,920
in Vegas there they're going to have 
recreational.

1280
00:53:16,921 --> 00:53:19,170
But,
but now that they have medical,

1281
00:53:19,171 --> 00:53:22,140
if you have a card from anywhere you can
go and,

1282
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,630
uh,
in the vegas a dispensary,

1283
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:26,070
what's up is there's so

1284
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,940
many people that are in jail for life in
Vegas from the seventies,

1285
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,890
right?
For life,

1286
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:37,040
for like getting caught with a dime bag.
Vegas used to be the worst place in the 

1287
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,310
world when it came to pot.
I don't know why.

1288
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:41,260
I guess they were trying to discourage 
you.

1289
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:46,000
This is what it was there.
They got legalized prostitution,

1290
00:53:46,001 --> 00:53:47,710
legalized gambling,
open carry,

1291
00:53:47,711 --> 00:53:52,711
handguns,
liquor available 24 hours a day on the 

1292
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:52,711
street.
You can actually walk out onto the strip

1293
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:53,470
at 5:00
in the morning,

1294
00:53:53,471 --> 00:53:56,080
crack open a beer and bad on the camel 
toe races.

1295
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:59,950
But don't you dare out of joint because 
there's children here.

1296
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:08,030
Children,
I think they were just trying to 

1297
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:09,721
discourage people from getting high 
because it probably cut it on the 

1298
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:09,750
profits when you assume that,
uh,

1299
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,070
the last thing I want to do and I get 
high as gamble.

1300
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:14,100
I want to look at buildings.
I go,

1301
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:15,880
look how much,
much money this building cost.

1302
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,250
Where are they getting their money?
They must be for people like me,

1303
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:23,930
like me that don't smoke in here to 
always feel like I never had the urge to

1304
00:54:28,451 --> 00:54:33,451
gamble when I'm high ever.
But if I was drunk and I walked into a 

1305
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:34,450
casino,
I'd be like,

1306
00:54:34,451 --> 00:54:37,080
let's see what happens.
Absolutely.

1307
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,500
Come out.
Absolutely.

1308
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,630
But I'm not much of a gambler.
I'm good.

1309
00:54:40,631 --> 00:54:43,060
You're good.
I'm not much of a gambler.

1310
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:43,980
You know what?
I

1311
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:50,580
played a lot of cards when I first 
started working in Vegas and then I got 

1312
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,110
hit a couple of times and,
and uh,

1313
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:54,420
uh,
literally.

1314
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:55,290
I mean,
if you're gonna,

1315
00:54:55,291 --> 00:55:00,291
if you're gonna bet 300 bucks a hand,
you better have a half million bucks 

1316
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:01,870
sitting there or you'll get beat because
it hit.

1317
00:55:01,871 --> 00:55:06,871
It just accelerates so high off of the 
three grand off at a $300 bet.

1318
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,020
And so if you're not ready to really bet
it,

1319
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:13,100
you should just not.
If you don't have a,

1320
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:18,620
if you can't stay there until it all 
cycles back through a in case you start 

1321
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:22,710
on the wrong side of it been,
now I'll go my mother.

1322
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:25,410
My mother's 81,
she likes to get hammered and gamble.

1323
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,920
She does.
She's always in Vegas.

1324
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:33,530
I was there two weeks ago and I looked 
over on the side of the stage and my 

1325
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:33,530
mother was there.

1326
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,560
I had no idea she was coming all the way
from cocoa and she was just over there 

1327
00:55:36,721 --> 00:55:38,160
waving.
That's awesome.

1328
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,530
And she gets hammered.
Gambles.

1329
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,960
Yeah.
She plays blackjack,

1330
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,850
Texas.
Hold him.

1331
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,920
And she was one of those harder mother,
you know,

1332
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:46,270
or you know,
jen,

1333
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:51,310
you,
you think that Jim can't be skill all 

1334
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:52,170
skill.
But anytime I play my mother in Jen,

1335
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,850
she's like,
it takes one car and lays them down.

1336
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,370
And I'm like,
well,

1337
00:55:54,371 --> 00:55:59,371
how can you do that?
You can't be good and just draw those 

1338
00:55:59,371 --> 00:55:59,371
cards.
What are you doing?

1339
00:55:59,371 --> 00:56:00,800
In my grandmother was worse than her 
was.

1340
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,880
So she plays serious poker but not with 
serious money and uh,

1341
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,950
more than she used to.
But,

1342
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:08,790
but,
uh,

1343
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:10,650
and then my son loves to play Texas,
hold 'em.

1344
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:13,860
So if he comes out to vegas then I'll go
play with him.

1345
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,640
I have a bunch of friends and gamble 
really high and I don't have that gene.

1346
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:22,730
I'm missing it.
That's a good one not to have because 

1347
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:22,730
it's a,
you,

1348
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:24,900
you can really feel stupid the next day 
when you're going accurate,

1349
00:56:24,901 --> 00:56:26,290
uh,
gotten well.

1350
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:30,880
One of them at least a moderate late 
day.

1351
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:32,000
Ford escort,
you know,

1352
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,840
are,
are several escorts.

1353
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,700
I gotta get something out of this 
instead.

1354
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,980
I got absolutely nothing except free 
booze.

1355
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,970
So my friend Dana white is lost as much 
as a million dollars in a night.

1356
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:46,950
It lowered.
Yeah.

1357
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,720
But he won like,
did it say one seven?

1358
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,130
I think he said he wants seven one 
night.

1359
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,690
Yeah,
I don't get it.

1360
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,220
He's got it though.
Whatever it is,

1361
00:56:53,221 --> 00:56:54,610
he's got better.
Yeah.

1362
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,980
But you know what,
that's also,

1363
00:56:55,981 --> 00:56:56,560
uh,
uh,

1364
00:56:56,561 --> 00:56:57,510
that's uh,
one of the,

1365
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,600
a big thing with people that have been 
punched a lot.

1366
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:05,160
Like he was a boxer for a long time and 
a lot of MMA fighters,

1367
00:57:05,161 --> 00:57:08,160
a lot of people that have had 
experienced a lot of head trauma.

1368
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,130
They like to gamble.
There's a weird correlation there.

1369
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,300
They don't know why.
I wonder,

1370
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,790
wonder if John Daly ever got hit in the 
head.

1371
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:18,120
I'm sure somebody punched that guy for 
sure.

1372
00:57:18,121 --> 00:57:19,380
Right.
Who didn't punch that guy?

1373
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,530
He's a big dude,
but still somebody probably punched him.

1374
00:57:22,531 --> 00:57:23,610
He's A.
Yeah,

1375
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:24,300
probably.
So

1376
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,320
baby boy,
he just has a gambling problem.

1377
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,230
He's finding he was sober for five years
and he's a buddy of mine.

1378
00:57:29,231 --> 00:57:30,580
I mean,
got to say he's a buddy of mine.

1379
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,440
Whenever the masters comes to,
uh,

1380
00:57:33,441 --> 00:57:35,410
Augusta,
uh,

1381
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,430
the,
uh,

1382
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:41,540
he's always there and he sells merge 
avis genius because he's the only 

1383
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,490
person,
number one.

1384
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:47,491
He's the most famous golfer in the city 
at that time is John Daly more famous 

1385
00:57:47,491 --> 00:57:49,630
than anybody playing in that tournament.
And then he's accessible.

1386
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:54,660
He likes people.
And so he'll go out there and sell 

1387
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:54,660
$250,000,
$300,000

1388
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,830
words a merge out of this huge,
you know,

1389
00:57:56,831 --> 00:58:01,831
you got this big prevost tour thing and 
the big old trailer instead up and wow,

1390
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:06,100
his own store at the hooters right next 
to the ride next to the golf tournament.

1391
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,610
And uh,
so that's genius during that time.

1392
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,100
Yeah.
And,

1393
00:58:10,101 --> 00:58:11,010
and,
and he,

1394
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:14,620
you know,
it's all his brands and uh,

1395
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:19,650
you know,
he just makes a kill and doing it and 

1396
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:19,650
uh,
it is brilliant in.

1397
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:22,420
But uh,
I parked my tour bus right next to his,

1398
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:25,480
so that's the time I see him,
you know,

1399
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,430
is whenever he's doing now.
He now he's on the senior tour,

1400
00:58:27,431 --> 00:58:28,290
so I don't even know.

1401
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,460
I don't follow golf,
but I followed that guy,

1402
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,770
you know what I mean?
Like he's a fun dude,

1403
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:34,770
you know,
he,

1404
00:58:34,771 --> 00:58:36,590
he gets crazy.
It does a lot of wild,

1405
00:58:36,591 --> 00:58:38,000
nutty shit.
Likes to get hammered.

1406
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:43,060
Right.
It's like I liked the fact that there's 

1407
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:43,520
a guy like that out there that can do 
it.

1408
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:44,930
Yeah.
And he's not,

1409
00:58:44,931 --> 00:58:46,850
he might not be the best golfer in the 
world anymore,

1410
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,740
you know,
but he's still a very good golfer and he

1411
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:52,280
still like this character.
Like it's part of the thing.

1412
00:58:52,281 --> 00:58:54,380
It's not just who wins the golf 
tournament.

1413
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:57,170
It's like I want to see John Daly play,
I want to see them talk.

1414
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,940
I want to see them get crazy.
Right.

1415
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,360
Yeah.
So,

1416
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,080
well he gets crazy,
you know.

1417
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:04,680
And uh,
he got sober for a few years and then he

1418
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,310
got,
he called me the other day,

1419
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,480
like,
oh,

1420
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:13,481
whenever that started again,
that was just baked and then the last 

1421
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:17,641
time I was at last year to go.
So we got really trashed and he was 

1422
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:20,810
doing a podcast or a,
some kind of radio show out of a,

1423
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,930
at hooters.
And besides that,

1424
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:26,270
he's got a radio show or did for a while
and,

1425
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,430
and he's just drunk as shit,
just trash and the PGA tour.

1426
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,230
And I'm like,
you know,

1427
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:36,040
you really golf on exemptions,
you know,

1428
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:37,530
they're going to.
But uh,

1429
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:42,540
I didn't say anything to him,
but it mean he's just either over the 

1430
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,130
top,
sober or over the top drunk.

1431
00:59:43,131 --> 00:59:44,890
He can't be,
he can't be in.

1432
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:50,020
There's also just dead honest.
We will not lie to you to make you feel 

1433
00:59:51,891 --> 00:59:53,080
better,
will not lie to you,

1434
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:53,990
make you feel bad.

1435
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:59,410
He just won't lie.
He talks about how he feels and you 

1436
00:59:59,410 --> 00:59:59,410
know,
he's just one of those guys that,

1437
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:00,140
uh,
that,

1438
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:02,090
you know,
and that's why it's so popular.

1439
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,220
That's why everybody,
that's why the people love it.

1440
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,860
We could all use more of that.
All of us,

1441
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:07,950
right?
Uh,

1442
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:10,010
I don't know how many.
I think I could use less.

1443
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:14,670
I think that's what my.
I think I'm going to start lying more in

1444
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:19,680
the 2017.
Just stay drunk and keep lying drunk and

1445
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,090
keep lying.
That's a great one.

1446
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:26,000
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

1447
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:31,060
At a certain point in time,
you know how much fucking sand is left 

1448
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:31,060
in this Goddamn hourglass.
What are we doing with it?

1449
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:31,580
Right?
You know it.

1450
01:00:31,581 --> 01:00:32,120
Any.
Yeah.

1451
01:00:32,121 --> 01:00:37,121
Right.
We can on a continued path of 

1452
01:00:37,121 --> 01:00:37,430
improvement and spiritual enlightenment.
Or do we eventually go,

1453
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:38,960
hey guys,
there's a cliff coming up.

1454
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,570
Let's just have a drink.
What's happened is a fucking cliff was a

1455
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:42,910
cliff right over there.
Oh yeah,

1456
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,070
that's what,
you know,

1457
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,340
that's what Margo and I are saying is,
uh,

1458
01:00:46,341 --> 01:00:47,140
is that,
uh,

1459
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,880
we're already dead.
That's how fast it goes.

1460
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:54,881
We're already dead.
So while we got this last couple of 

1461
01:00:54,881 --> 01:00:55,310
minutes here,
let's have some fun.

1462
01:00:55,311 --> 01:01:00,311
Let's not forget that.
Buried some really close friends and 

1463
01:01:00,311 --> 01:01:01,910
really not right next to each other.
About a year and a half ago.

1464
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:05,390
And that broke my heart,
I didn't want to do standup anymore.

1465
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,850
And it just horrible stuff.
And then,

1466
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:09,380
uh,
and then,

1467
01:01:09,381 --> 01:01:10,880
uh,
my buddy that dad this weekend,

1468
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,090
I saw him three days before at a party 
and he was fine.

1469
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:16,490
He was laughing.
He's fit as he can be,

1470
01:01:16,491 --> 01:01:20,210
plays hockey.
He's a 69 years old,

1471
01:01:20,211 --> 01:01:21,770
but he was just really,
really.

1472
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:25,400
He ate a hamburger without the bun while
I was sitting there with him.

1473
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,400
And I was like,
I bet he regrets that now looking back 

1474
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:30,400
on it,
fuck,

1475
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,320
I should eat.
And that fucking Bowen.

1476
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:34,640
And then in then boom,
dead in three days.

1477
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:39,650
I'm just.
Was the actor guy that just died 

1478
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:39,860
recently?
Alan thicke.

1479
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,970
That's who it is.
That's what it is.

1480
01:01:40,971 --> 01:01:41,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

1481
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:44,420
I don't think it was on fear factor.
He was a sweetheart.

1482
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:45,080
Go.
He's a,

1483
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:48,620
he,
he's a charming human being.

1484
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:54,220
And I don't know when I'm bad at.
I'm really good friends with John Paul 

1485
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,040
Dejoria who,
who,

1486
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:58,180
uh,
owns patrona and Paul Mitchell and,

1487
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:03,280
and he is just a biker that made a 
billions of dollars with the,

1488
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,910
just a great.
Just a brilliant man.

1489
01:02:04,911 --> 01:02:05,850
And,
and uh,

1490
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,260
so he has these,
you know,

1491
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:13,270
men's nights that are kind of a League 
of extraordinary rich dudes and a,

1492
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,260
but every once in a while and 
entertainers sneaks in there like me and

1493
01:02:18,261 --> 01:02:19,980
Allen.
And so the first

1494
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,090
one I went there,
I was,

1495
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,200
I knew,
I recognize that of course because he 

1496
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:26,850
was a hugely famous television star when
I was watching television even.

1497
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:31,320
And uh,
but what attracted me was this to him as

1498
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:32,220
a man,
you know,

1499
01:02:32,221 --> 01:02:34,980
just uh,
his charisma and he just,

1500
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,680
he just one of those guys,
they can,

1501
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:38,620
uh,
that,

1502
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,560
you know,
just a man's man,

1503
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,910
you know,
man,

1504
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,170
just want to hang around them.
Yeah.

1505
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:46,130
I was really shocked.
I was really shocked too though.

1506
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:49,240
Nice and friendly was.
And uh,

1507
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,100
you know,
took his last.

1508
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:56,160
He had to do some physical things.
You had to climb on something on the 

1509
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:56,160
side of a building or something like 
that.

1510
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:56,420
And he won.
He wound up losing.

1511
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:57,470
Took it like a champ,

1512
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:58,800
right?
Oh yeah.

1513
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:03,870
Smiling the whole wave play.
Contact hockey with faith needs to stay 

1514
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:08,870
the wrong.
He got his knees done.

1515
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,910
Yeah.
You still play hockey.

1516
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:14,150
They told him not to,
but he,

1517
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,470
he's like,
what am I going to do?

1518
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,650
Oh my gosh.
So it works pretty good in it.

1519
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:22,690
But uh,
he was playing hockey with his phone 

1520
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,821
when he died and the end,
his son told me this and it was really 

1521
01:03:24,821 --> 01:03:24,860
funny.
He goes,

1522
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:29,940
while he was on the fucking stretcher 
putting him in the ambulance and uh,

1523
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,670
he goes,
sorry guys,

1524
01:03:31,671 --> 01:03:35,440
I'm an asshole just to stop in the 
gangs.

1525
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:39,290
And then he was dead 15 minutes later,
but he,

1526
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:44,090
but he got a laugh on the way out the 
door and people were saying,

1527
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:45,700
man,
I want a tragic thing that,

1528
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:50,710
you know,
he died quick and I've had two friends 

1529
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:50,710
die slow.
You don't want any part of that.

1530
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:54,791
And so quick.
That's when we all agree with that 

1531
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:54,791
quick.
We want to go quick,

1532
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:55,820
I want to go quick.
And uh,

1533
01:03:56,110 --> 01:04:01,110
you know that that's what he did and he 
was with his son was with him when he 

1534
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:04,961
took his last breath.
I think that's a good thing and I think 

1535
01:04:04,961 --> 01:04:04,961
it's,
I don't think it is too,

1536
01:04:04,961 --> 01:04:05,240
when he looks back on it,
if he doesn't already,

1537
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:08,060
you know what a real touchy subject 
isn't a real touchy subject,

1538
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:09,460
right?
People dying.

1539
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,810
It's a real touchy and it's also a real 
touching.

1540
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:16,780
Like what we think is gonna happen after
that right now.

1541
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,640
There's people that are there,
they're like real,

1542
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:24,850
real sensitive about what they think is 
going to happen and whether it's 

1543
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:28,151
nothing.
A lot of people are like convinced it's 

1544
01:04:28,151 --> 01:04:30,311
nothing.
I'll say to you with such fucking 

1545
01:04:30,311 --> 01:04:30,311
conviction,
listen,

1546
01:04:30,311 --> 01:04:31,250
when you die,
it's nothing.

1547
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,360
Well,
it goes dark.

1548
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:37,450
I know for a fact that's not true 
because I lived in a haunted house and 

1549
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:40,070
uh,
if there's a haunted house,

1550
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,230
then somebody,
there is an afterlife if,

1551
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,210
because we.
There was definitely a haunted house.

1552
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,740
Where did you live?
It was a,

1553
01:04:45,741 --> 01:04:49,260
it was a Lake House that side of Austin 
and on Lake Lbj and Kingsland,

1554
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:54,310
Texas,
and we had to sign documents at closing 

1555
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:55,190
saying that it had been told to us that 
it was a haunted house.

1556
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:59,310
You have to do that in Texas a and 
they'd had a,

1557
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:04,830
they had two mediums that I'm an extra 
large and said the same exact thing.

1558
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:08,630
It's the ghost name is Whitey Sour.
Oh my God.

1559
01:05:08,631 --> 01:05:11,810
And he was the barber for the town and 
uh,

1560
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:16,990
and,
and they couldn't tell why it was still 

1561
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:16,990
there,
but he was obviously there.

1562
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:17,030
He could,

1563
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:20,680
he would do these things in front of 
people.

1564
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:26,010
You could put,
take a pot of water right out of the 

1565
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:26,010
tap,
put it on the stove,

1566
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:28,000
stove turned off,
and just sit there and wait.

1567
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:33,660
And it starts to vibrate and that it 
vibrate to where the waves came in from 

1568
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,890
the center to the middle and then bounce
up in the middle.

1569
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,400
And then you could get a hold of it 
because you're obviously stronger than 

1570
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,581
the ghost.
You can sell it back down and let go of 

1571
01:05:44,581 --> 01:05:45,010
that.
And,

1572
01:05:45,011 --> 01:05:46,420
uh,
and he would do it again.

1573
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:47,980
So,
uh,

1574
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:48,960
you know,
so I,

1575
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:54,140
and I know that is,
I mean I happened to just know that to 

1576
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:54,550
be a fact that,
uh,

1577
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:55,520
I lived in a haunted house

1578
01:05:55,780 --> 01:06:00,780
was how many people do you think have 
actually lived in a haunted house and 

1579
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:02,630
how many people are just fucking crazy 
because that's the problem if you really

1580
01:06:02,631 --> 01:06:04,340
did live in a haunted house.
And I believe he did,

1581
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:10,240
you know,
that some people who've told similar 

1582
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:10,240
stories are just fucking crazy and that 
might be the problem.

1583
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:15,190
The problem is trying to differentiate 
between real unusual experiences which 

1584
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:19,601
may or not be possible.
That can happen to anybody just because 

1585
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:20,150
it hasn't happened to you or it hasn't 
happened to me.

1586
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,370
I'm walking through life assuming that 
it's bullshit.

1587
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:24,440
But if it did happen right in front of 
you,

1588
01:06:24,441 --> 01:06:25,970
you'll go,
holy shit.

1589
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:31,150
How am I going to describe what this is?
How many people are pretending things 

1590
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:31,150
like that are happening now?

1591
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,730
I don't know,
but it's just something that I've always

1592
01:06:34,731 --> 01:06:39,731
been able to say what after I've lived 
there that I know for a fact that the 

1593
01:06:39,731 --> 01:06:41,040
somethings happens afterwards in,
in,

1594
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:46,180
uh,
I had a talk with a yet I bought the 

1595
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:48,911
house.
It was still making payments to his 

1596
01:06:48,911 --> 01:06:49,610
daughter and uh,
whenever we first moved there,

1597
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:52,340
uh,
my girlfriend at the time,

1598
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:57,341
her uncle's helped move her stuff down 
there and they had a bunk bed set up in 

1599
01:06:57,341 --> 01:07:01,301
my son's room,
but they didn't want him at a mattress 

1600
01:07:01,301 --> 01:07:01,640
on the bottom and along the top.
And he put his shoes up there and during

1601
01:07:01,641 --> 01:07:06,641
the night for no reason,
the shoes got pushed off and fell and 

1602
01:07:06,641 --> 01:07:08,290
hit him in the chest.
And I was totally whining and a,

1603
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:12,020
that's fucking yet.
And so the next day,

1604
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,930
uh,
I walked into that room and I said,

1605
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:18,940
uh,
why did listen and we'll make a deal 

1606
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:18,940
with you.

1607
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,580
I love it that you're here.
It's filing me.

1608
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,300
Uh,
uh,

1609
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,570
we have one of his chairs.
Then we wouldn't let anybody sit in with

1610
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:26,840
his chair.
So,

1611
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:27,880
uh,
and uh,

1612
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:29,320
as I said,
well,

1613
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:32,150
I'm gonna tell you something right now.
You fuck with my little boy,

1614
01:07:32,151 --> 01:07:35,290
I'm gonna hit your daughter in the mouth
because I,

1615
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,730
I saw her every month when I made the 
payment.

1616
01:07:37,731 --> 01:07:39,780
So if he was going to Jack with my 
little kid,

1617
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,660
fucking punch them teeth and you're 
going to punch his,

1618
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,450
his daughter.
Not really,

1619
01:07:44,451 --> 01:07:47,750
not really,
but it's rent to coast to coast.

1620
01:07:47,751 --> 01:07:49,300
That's so gangster.
Yeah,

1621
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:51,800
went in me.
Never,

1622
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:56,801
never,
ever saw any activity in that room 

1623
01:07:56,801 --> 01:07:56,801
again.

1624
01:07:56,801 --> 01:07:59,710
My grandparents had a guy died in the 
house and they always claim that they 

1625
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:00,680
saw him.
He was like a,

1626
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:05,681
um,
a guy who rented a room in their attic 

1627
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,770
and uh,
he died and my grandmother always would 

1628
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:10,130
swear that she could hear him walking 
around up there and he'd be there.

1629
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,900
You know,
if there is,

1630
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:14,380
we know that this is like most people 
here,

1631
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:16,190
ghost stories and you'll get the fuck 
out of here.

1632
01:08:16,191 --> 01:08:19,040
It's because so many ghost shows me.
How many times can you watch a person go

1633
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:23,900
into a basement with a windows night 
vision screens on and look at?

1634
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:26,000
Nothing and go.
What did you hear that?

1635
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:27,470
What was that?
Oh my God.

1636
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:33,470
Television shows dedicated to one thing,
like an egg will move in inch over a 

1637
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,780
year or something.

1638
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:39,030
I think it would be super arrogant to 
assume that it's not possible to go 

1639
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:40,810
surreal that you just haven't 
experienced them yet.

1640
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:44,680
Most people haven't experienced them 
because if there's all sorts of types of

1641
01:08:44,681 --> 01:08:45,220
life,
right?

1642
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:50,221
There's people that are born with birth 
defects that make them tiny and other 

1643
01:08:50,221 --> 01:08:53,230
people are born with gigantism and deaf 
is this and life itself is not like this

1644
01:08:53,231 --> 01:08:58,231
perfect mathematical science.
It's filled with all sorts of mistakes 

1645
01:08:58,231 --> 01:09:02,311
and errors and weird shit.
If there's a transition between this 

1646
01:09:02,311 --> 01:09:03,550
stage of life and the next stage of 
life,

1647
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,710
would we assume that it would be 
perfect?

1648
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:06,080
No,
we.

1649
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,430
We assume if there is a spirit or some 
sort of a soul in people,

1650
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,600
we would assume that that transition 
sometimes misses and sometimes you get 

1651
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:18,600
caught in the howling in between the 
worlds and he just ricocheted back and 

1652
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,810
forth off of both places.

1653
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,720
Well,
you can't unsmoked that joint can.

1654
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,520
You can.
Hey,

1655
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,560
you know what?
I'll tell you something that's kind of 

1656
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:29,560
an interesting story.
Uh,

1657
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,920
my uncle who was a preacher,
a southern Baptist preacher,

1658
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:35,910
a brilliant man who's age three 
doctorates in psychology,

1659
01:09:35,911 --> 01:09:36,990
philosophy,
theology,

1660
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:39,090
wow.
And a fun,

1661
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:39,630
fun,
fun,

1662
01:09:39,631 --> 01:09:44,631
fun guy to talk to and uh,
was at one time the president of the 

1663
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:50,510
Southern Baptist Convention,
Dr Charles [inaudible] is his name and 

1664
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:50,510
uh,
which is a very,

1665
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:53,661
very powerful position to have in the 
south to be the president of that 

1666
01:09:53,661 --> 01:09:53,661
convention.
Uh,

1667
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:56,880
and uh,
so I was talking to him,

1668
01:09:56,881 --> 01:10:01,140
he was a long time ago and they have a 
lot of disagreement.

1669
01:10:01,141 --> 01:10:06,141
He kind of had a nervous breakdown and 
he showed up at my grandmother's 

1670
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:08,220
birthday party and he had a,
uh,

1671
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:12,370
riding a harley with no shirt on.
And then he went down.

1672
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:16,230
He taught Gus Gospel according to 
Charlie for a while.

1673
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:17,520
But,
uh,

1674
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:21,600
this is what he took because we were 
just talking about this exact thing.

1675
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,210
He goes,
he goes to that well,

1676
01:10:24,211 --> 01:10:27,480
run a,
here's what I believe.

1677
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:31,920
I believe that when we die,
we're going to be surprised.

1678
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:39,020
That's all he's got.
That's all you got after all these 

1679
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:39,120
books,
all these years of Vietnam,

1680
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:42,300
that's all he's got his fucking gun.

1681
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,880
When I was young,
I was real dismissive of religion 

1682
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,630
because I was real religious at one 
point when I was real young.

1683
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,810
I went to Catholic school and um,
that was really,

1684
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:57,110
it was a,
it was a good experience because it was 

1685
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:58,851
a bad experience.
So I realized that these are like these 

1686
01:10:58,851 --> 01:11:01,311
mean flawed people that are teaching 
what they think is supposedly God's 

1687
01:11:01,311 --> 01:11:05,481
word.
And I became like a very anti religious 

1688
01:11:05,481 --> 01:11:08,391
person for a long time where I thought 
of religion as being like an ideology 

1689
01:11:08,391 --> 01:11:10,560
that controls your brain.
But as I've gotten older,

1690
01:11:10,561 --> 01:11:15,561
one of the things that I've been 
thinking more and more is that although 

1691
01:11:15,561 --> 01:11:18,330
the Bible's definitely been altered by a
bunch of different people,

1692
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:23,331
there's a difference between the Old 
Testament in the new testament and even 

1693
01:11:23,331 --> 01:11:25,230
the translations of the Old Testament.
They were trying to say something.

1694
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:30,680
They would try.
They wrote this fucking thing down and 

1695
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,321
passed it down more than anything else.
Like the Bible's almost like the story 

1696
01:11:33,321 --> 01:11:37,230
of life because if you go that far back,
there's no other stories.

1697
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,270
You go far

1698
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:42,050
back in the old testament stories.
There are no,

1699
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:47,140
there are no books.
You have to go to other cultures that 

1700
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:47,270
had similar stories.
Right?

1701
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:50,270
And that there were all the same thing 
like the epic of Gilgamesh.

1702
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:53,430
So similar to like know when the art is,
all these cool,

1703
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,600
but you know,
they've got all these similarities were 

1704
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:58,600
trying to tell us about something,
right?

1705
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:02,120
And most of it was be a good person,
you know,

1706
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,860
I mean,
that was Christ message.

1707
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:07,940
I grew up in the watching my uncle 
preach.

1708
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:11,000
And so when I was a kid,
I loved church.

1709
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:12,170
I mean,
I loved it,

1710
01:12:12,171 --> 01:12:13,760
loved it.
I love to go watch him preach.

1711
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:18,770
I'd go watch him preach on Sunday,
Sunday night and go watch him preach on 

1712
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:20,930
Wednesday and a charismatic,
funny,

1713
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,910
uh,
and uh,

1714
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:23,630
just,
uh,

1715
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,650
and he comes from nowhere.
His mother was a hooker and uh,

1716
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:29,070
but,
uh,

1717
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,900
all of the self made man.
And uh,

1718
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:35,920
so I loved it.
And then we moved and I went to a 

1719
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,221
regular Baptist church and I was like,
this fucking get me out of this 

1720
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,440
motherfucker now where's the youth 
group?

1721
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:47,650
He used to have these youth groups that 
were more fun than I've had anywhere 

1722
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:47,650
else.

1723
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:49,970
We had went on a choir tour where we had
raised money for it,

1724
01:12:49,971 --> 01:12:54,971
own pins or whatever the fuck it was.
And then we all piled on a shitty bus 

1725
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:56,870
and took off saying it in churches.
And uh,

1726
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:59,510
and it was a,
it was freedom.

1727
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:01,670
It was total freedom because I could 
buy,

1728
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I could eat whatever I wanted.
I had $3 and fifty cents at 13 years 

1729
01:13:07,191 --> 01:13:07,580
old,
12,

1730
01:13:07,581 --> 01:13:12,581
13 years old,
11 maybe to spend in any restaurant I 

1731
01:13:12,581 --> 01:13:13,640
wanted.
I could get whatever I wanted.

1732
01:13:13,641 --> 01:13:15,500
So every meal,
Chilean French fries,

1733
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,300
that's all I want,
baby.

1734
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:22,480
You just go bring me the Chili and the 
fucking French fries and pile them up 

1735
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:22,700
right here.
But,

1736
01:13:22,701 --> 01:13:24,680
uh,
so that's.

1737
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,680
But once I found out that it's,
you know,

1738
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:31,880
there are these really great orators and
there some really terrible,

1739
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:36,710
horrible.
It's like comic books or as actors,

1740
01:13:36,711 --> 01:13:37,920
you know,
all the above this.

1741
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:43,390
There's always a bunch of that know he 
made no bones about attitude that did 

1742
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:44,000
it.
If somebody was coming in to look at him

1743
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:49,001
to preach at a bigger place,
he would pull stuff out of is a 

1744
01:13:49,001 --> 01:13:49,290
repertoire,
you know,

1745
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:54,460
because he knows that he's got a killer 
45 months in particular that borders 

1746
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,260
with and he didn't make any bones about 
that to me.

1747
01:13:57,261 --> 01:13:58,040
He goes,
yeah,

1748
01:13:58,041 --> 01:13:59,420
they're coming in to watch me.
So I want to.

1749
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,390
I wanted to do my last story or 
whatever.

1750
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:03,680
Which is great.
You know,

1751
01:14:03,681 --> 01:14:05,690
and uh,
but uh,

1752
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:10,870
well Mike,
you were talking about with your 

1753
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:12,101
material that it takes like three years 
to really ripen and I'm sure they'll 

1754
01:14:12,101 --> 01:14:12,190
come up with a new show

1755
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:17,190
every fuck and Sunday and then you 
couldn't do the same thing Sunday night 

1756
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:20,701
or the same thing Wednesday night 
because you had people like me with 

1757
01:14:20,701 --> 01:14:21,880
every show.
It's a lot of jazz improvisation.

1758
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,790
Yeah.
Lot of re we're recalling facts.

1759
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:31,040
It's kind of like a,
like Dr Phil is because Dr Phil does 

1760
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:36,090
three of those shows that day with no 
script has no idea what he's saying,

1761
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:41,100
walking into it.
No idea what's going to happen when he 

1762
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,070
walks into it and I've got to tell you 
right now,

1763
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:45,310
nobody else could do it.
You can do it.

1764
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,030
I dare you not do it.
I couldn't do it.

1765
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:51,220
You don't have many days a week or a 
month.

1766
01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:54,910
I'm actually interesting.
Like for the rest of them,

1767
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:59,911
I'm me.
I'm getting a dial tone the rest of the 

1768
01:14:59,911 --> 01:15:02,020
time I'm getting a dial tone.
I'm telling you.

1769
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:03,550
But uh,
but,

1770
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:06,430
but doc,
I mean just a three hour long shows that

1771
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:07,910
day when those scripts all day long.

1772
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:10,360
No one.
Yes.

1773
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:12,340
You do it just like this.
Like you're doing it right now.

1774
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:13,420
Yeah.
There's no.

1775
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:17,290
There's no reason why we can't get them 
introduced to your conversation.

1776
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:20,770
You're not no fucking way.
That's the weed,

1777
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:26,130
the weeds fucking with you.
You've been telling some amazing 

1778
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:26,130
stories.
How dare you,

1779
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:27,600
you could do it.
He was like,

1780
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:31,000
there's no reason why somebody figured 
out that Dr Phil can do it.

1781
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:32,530
He can do it.
He did it.

1782
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,970
He's doing it.
He's currently doing it.

1783
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:36,530
Somebody figured out that he can 
improvise about health and all.

1784
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:39,670
You could do what you're doing right now
all day,

1785
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:42,360
every day,
whenever you want to do,

1786
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:47,370
don't need any help.
I don't need to fucking Shitload of 

1787
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:47,370
hell.
I know,

1788
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:52,171
but if you're going to,
you're going to still make it home 

1789
01:15:52,171 --> 01:15:52,171
either way.
You know,

1790
01:15:52,171 --> 01:15:52,171
these are tough conversations,
right?

1791
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,120
There's to be banter,
banter.

1792
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,400
You fucking hilarious.
I dare you.

1793
01:15:57,401 --> 01:16:01,180
You know what?
I got offered a t o a radio job one time

1794
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:02,350
when I was a,
uh,

1795
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:07,470
it,
it was probably for twice what I was 

1796
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:09,451
making as a standup comic and it was 
with Eddie fingers in Cincinnati and uh,

1797
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,590
uh,
and I was really 125,000

1798
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:19,600
bucks and a bunch of cash to me at the 
time.

1799
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:25,690
The right the pilot boat boat,
you know,

1800
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:29,680
Mr.
that's the thing about money.

1801
01:16:29,681 --> 01:16:33,850
Is that why you think that the rich 
people have twice as much money as you,

1802
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:38,850
but they know they have a thousand times
you really was.

1803
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:40,720
So when 25,
but anyway,

1804
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:46,200
but what I realized was that they saw me
come in once a year and a in murder on 

1805
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:52,021
their radio show,
but getting that out of me every day.

1806
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:55,600
There's no way Ron black five days a 
week where we differ.

1807
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:58,630
We have a problem here because I have 
fucking hang out with you all the time.

1808
01:16:58,631 --> 01:17:01,360
Now at the comedy store.
How many times we drank together?

1809
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,280
A dozen.
At least.

1810
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:06,070
Maybe two dozen every fucking time.
It's been this.

1811
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:08,800
It's been awesome.
Oh well,

1812
01:17:08,801 --> 01:17:12,710
but know I'm just saying don't count on 
it.

1813
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:17,880
Possibly count on you not being,
you know,

1814
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,290
that doesn't make any sense at all.
He went up to that joint.

1815
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,850
Oh,
we got another one man.

1816
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:24,500
Oh fuck that one.
That one's gone.

1817
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,330
Oh No,
no,

1818
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:25,540
no.

1819
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:28,470
Thanks.
This is important.

1820
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:30,720
We're already struggling with reality,
right?

1821
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:36,160
So let's get things notice.
Notice you're the one carrying the 

1822
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,321
conversation.
Like what the fuck you telling like 10 

1823
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,550
epics stories,
Dermott Rowan warrant.

1824
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:49,640
Why is it,
that's something I don't mind to make 

1825
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:49,640
you embarrassed,
but why is it,

1826
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:53,851
it's something that all the great comics
have was this like a ridiculous humility

1827
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:58,580
and a lot of ways,
you know,

1828
01:17:59,430 --> 01:18:02,390
almost everybody had a conversation with
Dave chappelle once Dave Chappelle and I

1829
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:03,570
were talking and we're,
uh,

1830
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:07,940
we went to this fucking Hollywood party 
was a dba,

1831
01:18:07,941 --> 01:18:11,210
but the hills,
it was Naomi Campbell's birthday party.

1832
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:15,830
This was a 50 foot tall naked photo of 
Naomi Campbell.

1833
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:19,400
We had to go to a place and we had a 
park and then from where we parked,

1834
01:18:19,401 --> 01:18:21,960
we had to get on a bus that took us to 
this fucking house.

1835
01:18:21,961 --> 01:18:23,270
This house is ridiculous.

1836
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,080
And uh,
I get up there with Dave and I was like,

1837
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:29,130
it was so many,
so weird.

1838
01:18:29,131 --> 01:18:34,131
It's like Demi Moore was there and Lenny
Kravitz was there and all these famous 

1839
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:37,691
people were there.
I saw like a ton of famous people and 

1840
01:18:37,691 --> 01:18:37,691
I'm like,
dude,

1841
01:18:37,691 --> 01:18:40,511
this is so weird.
There's like this gathering of famous 

1842
01:18:40,511 --> 01:18:40,511
people I get.
This is so strange.

1843
01:18:40,511 --> 01:18:40,511
It was,
yeah,

1844
01:18:40,511 --> 01:18:41,990
man,
I wouldn't ever be one of those.

1845
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:43,550
I don't want to be one of those.
I go,

1846
01:18:43,551 --> 01:18:48,551
what are you talking about?
The most famous person in this fucking 

1847
01:18:48,551 --> 01:18:48,620
room.
And he looked at me like,

1848
01:18:48,621 --> 01:18:49,810
what?
And I go,

1849
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:50,840
dude,
you're the most.

1850
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:55,310
We're,
we're both body ached and we were beyond

1851
01:18:55,311 --> 01:19:00,311
high,
were beyond high and we're hanging out 

1852
01:19:00,311 --> 01:19:00,311
at this famous probably go,
dude,

1853
01:19:00,311 --> 01:19:00,920
you're the most famous person here.
He goes,

1854
01:19:00,921 --> 01:19:02,660
Joe stopped lying to me,
man.

1855
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,280
No doubt you're the most famous person 
here.

1856
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,990
I was playing the Denver and he was 
working at the,

1857
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:14,140
it was working out stuff.
It's a d at the comedy works in Denver,

1858
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:16,180
which is one of the best comedy clubs in
the country.

1859
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,690
One of the best and a,
the ice house.

1860
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:19,630
He was,
uh,

1861
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:20,370
he,
you know,

1862
01:19:20,371 --> 01:19:21,790
he was in there all week,
you know,

1863
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:24,310
doing science and uh,
so he,

1864
01:19:24,311 --> 01:19:26,120
uh,
he called and I,

1865
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:26,860
I,
I,

1866
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:28,800
I paid to see him in,
uh,

1867
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,560
in Santa Barbara like a year and a half 
ago.

1868
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,790
We were walking down the street and it 
was for sale.

1869
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:36,350
We walked up there even though he was 
there.

1870
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:38,470
Oh Wow.
I just have paid,

1871
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,270
me and my wife were paid,
walked in,

1872
01:19:40,271 --> 01:19:42,540
sat down,
and just how,

1873
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:46,470
I mean he,
he's a ca.

1874
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:51,740
What kind of like you in a way and that 
he'll walk out on some pretty thin limbs

1875
01:19:52,031 --> 01:19:57,031
and just jump on him and uh,
and has a punchline to back it up with 

1876
01:19:57,031 --> 01:19:57,031
him.

1877
01:19:57,031 --> 01:19:57,940
That was,
I was real,

1878
01:19:57,941 --> 01:20:02,941
real impressed.
And then he called me when I was in 

1879
01:20:02,941 --> 01:20:05,761
Denver and said,
would you come out and do a segue 

1880
01:20:05,761 --> 01:20:05,761
because I was coming in today,
early in,

1881
01:20:05,761 --> 01:20:07,760
in front of me and uh,
and I'm like,

1882
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:08,340
oh,
fuck yeah,

1883
01:20:08,341 --> 01:20:09,810
I'd love to.
And uh,

1884
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,580
so.
But anyway,

1885
01:20:11,581 --> 01:20:16,581
after his set here one night,
I hear it like we're at the comedy 

1886
01:20:16,581 --> 01:20:16,581
store,
the comedy store.

1887
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:22,280
I was leaving and uh,
I was walking up to my car and he's got 

1888
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:22,740
a bunch of people in a big old,
huge suv.

1889
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:23,790
And he goes,
Ron,

1890
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:26,080
white,
you're coming with us now.

1891
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,300
I got to go up.
No you don't.

1892
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:28,350
No you don't.
No,

1893
01:20:28,351 --> 01:20:29,520
you don't.
You're coming with us.

1894
01:20:29,521 --> 01:20:31,980
You have to come with us,
you are coming with us tonight,

1895
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:33,910
get in this car.
And I'm like,

1896
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:36,000
okay.
So we went to some club,

1897
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:38,400
couldn't tell you where it was.

1898
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:38,820
I mean,
I,

1899
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,500
you know,
not that far downtown somewhere,

1900
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:42,270
but really no door,
no name,

1901
01:20:42,271 --> 01:20:45,090
you know,
just to get through it.

1902
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:46,590
And,
and what it,

1903
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:51,710
what we did is we went out and we saw 
how much fun it was to be Dave fucking 

1904
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:52,470
Chappelle,
you know,

1905
01:20:52,471 --> 01:20:57,471
that the,
I go to the comedy store because I'm 

1906
01:20:57,471 --> 01:20:57,471
famous when I'm there,
you know,

1907
01:20:57,471 --> 01:20:57,690
it's,
you know,

1908
01:20:57,691 --> 01:20:59,180
I'm not famous everywhere.
He's failed,

1909
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:00,930
was everywhere.
And uh,

1910
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,980
and he's also,
you know,

1911
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:08,100
fun about it.
Some people mean he'll go engage every 

1912
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,180
table and talk to him.
I mean,

1913
01:21:09,181 --> 01:21:10,080
he's the,
he's not,

1914
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,120
you know,
see if that can be a comedian.

1915
01:21:12,121 --> 01:21:12,510
Oh,
get away,

1916
01:21:12,511 --> 01:21:13,600
get away,
get away with now.

1917
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:15,080
He's a great guy.
He's,

1918
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,010
he's a,
he's a weirdly great guy.

1919
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:19,880
Always has been to,
I think I met David.

1920
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:22,390
He was like 18 or something.
He was always like,

1921
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,150
just a super nice guy.

1922
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,250
Just always been very genuine,
you know?

1923
01:21:27,251 --> 01:21:32,251
And in the amazing pressure that you 
face and being I in a lot of ways,

1924
01:21:33,641 --> 01:21:37,480
the voice of a comedic generation when 
he was doing chappelle show,

1925
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:41,320
it was sort of the defining show of that
generation,

1926
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:46,350
but it's really no parallel.
He does like what two seasons did he do 

1927
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:50,371
two seasons seasons and then he had a 
$50 million dollar contract and then he 

1928
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:52,510
showed up in Africa or something.
I don't know exactly what happened,

1929
01:21:52,511 --> 01:21:55,860
but had some of the best sketches ever.
That one,

1930
01:21:55,930 --> 01:22:00,930
the blind guy who didn't know that he 
was black and he was a white 

1931
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:01,570
supremacist.
Holy Shit.

1932
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:07,020
I mean he was in the KKK and he didn't 
know that he was black because he was 

1933
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:07,140
blind.
He doesn't.

1934
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:10,210
One of the funniest bits the fucking 
universe has ever seen.

1935
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:16,100
He did.
He did it for two years and it sorta 

1936
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,870
when,
when they tried to change his show and 

1937
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:18,870
he just walked away,

1938
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:19,810
it's sort of like,
you know what?

1939
01:22:19,811 --> 01:22:21,970
I don't know anybody tried to change his
show at.

1940
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:24,030
I know they did.
You do?

1941
01:22:24,031 --> 01:22:25,890
Okay then.
But what I,

1942
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:31,230
you know,
that he couldn't go into stand up 

1943
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:32,010
because they wouldn't leave them alone,
you know,

1944
01:22:32,011 --> 01:22:36,300
we couldn't start going because right 
then he was ripe to play every major,

1945
01:22:36,301 --> 01:22:38,310
whatever,
whatever he wanted to sell,

1946
01:22:38,311 --> 01:22:39,980
he could sell it,
still can.

1947
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:42,450
And uh,
but they would rick,

1948
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:43,530
James,
Bitch,

1949
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,760
they would just scream at him the whole 
time and it,

1950
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:48,210
and I can only imagine how frustrating 
that would be.

1951
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,090
And uh,
but,

1952
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:51,810
uh,
that happened for a little while.

1953
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:55,140
Yeah.
Now it's security heavy.

1954
01:22:55,530 --> 01:23:00,530
I mean,
if you want to get thrown out of his 

1955
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:02,151
show,
there's a good chance you will because 

1956
01:23:02,151 --> 01:23:02,250
there's a bunch of big guys walking 
around and then they're,

1957
01:23:02,251 --> 01:23:03,780
you know,
they try to stay pretty low.

1958
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:05,980
But if you're,
if you think it's gonna be about you and

1959
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:09,780
Chappelle exchanging pleasantries,
urop,

1960
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:13,470
you're going to be shut up and then 
found out and set.

1961
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,270
But,
and I,

1962
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:19,450
I get it,
I'll have somebody throwing out on one 

1963
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:19,450
of my shows and in two seconds,
yeah,

1964
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:20,600
they think you just have to.
Oh,

1965
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:22,140
I,
I saw Christa,

1966
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:24,170
Leah's instagramming instagram the day.
And there was some,

1967
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:29,060
a couple that was leaving and apparently
they were just really rude to him during

1968
01:23:29,061 --> 01:23:31,310
the show and they were yelling out,
you're a loser and all this shit.

1969
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:34,270
And he and he,
you know,

1970
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,050
is so silly.
He's on.

1971
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:38,300
Chris is so silly.
He's on stage.

1972
01:23:38,301 --> 01:23:39,930
He's like,
you fucking idiots.

1973
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:41,120
Like,
you know,

1974
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,950
he's laughing about it.
He's like,

1975
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:45,290
one more thing,
one more thing by you fucking idiots.

1976
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:47,870
And the whole crowd starts cheering and 
it's,

1977
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:50,660
it's so ridiculous.
But this a couple.

1978
01:23:50,661 --> 01:23:52,820
Apparently they just wouldn't stop 
heckling him.

1979
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:58,060
They wouldn't stop calling him a loser,
like managing pain and go see somebody 

1980
01:23:58,060 --> 01:23:58,060
and then calling him a loser.
Like,

1981
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:01,070
like,
what the fuck?

1982
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:02,600
Like,
what happened?

1983
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:04,130
What happened?
Where's,

1984
01:24:04,131 --> 01:24:05,840
who needs a hug?
Who needs a hug first?

1985
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:07,480
I got a pretty good.
I got it.

1986
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:10,150
Pretty zero tolerance policy.
I mean,

1987
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:12,380
because I'm not going to banter with you
at all.

1988
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:17,620
I'm going to ask you to shut up.
And if you don't do that then I'm going 

1989
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:21,371
to tell you this.
Things have been set in motion that I 

1990
01:24:21,371 --> 01:24:24,161
cannot stop because you didn't listen to
what I said last time and I can't 

1991
01:24:24,161 --> 01:24:28,601
because if I do that somebody is already
walking over and they're going to get 

1992
01:24:28,601 --> 01:24:28,601
thrown out.

1993
01:24:28,601 --> 01:24:29,140
I'm talking about some fucking mortal 
Kombat.

1994
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:31,150
Goddamn.
Yeah.

1995
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:33,530
Oh,
some people see this.

1996
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:35,410
There's a lot of different kinds of 
people,

1997
01:24:35,411 --> 01:24:38,020
folks.
Some of them just don't get it.

1998
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:41,110
They just.
They're just too frustrating to interact

1999
01:24:41,111 --> 01:24:43,390
with.
They just want to make it about them and

2000
01:24:43,391 --> 01:24:46,900
scream out interruptive show for 
whatever reason,

2001
01:24:46,901 --> 01:24:49,240
and it's not their fault.
Maybe it's the way they were raised.

2002
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:51,360
Maybe it's the fucking genetics.
They were handed down.

2003
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:53,710
Don't go to the theater a lot.
There's a lot of things.

2004
01:24:53,711 --> 01:24:55,510
They might be drunk.
They might be fucked up.

2005
01:24:55,511 --> 01:24:57,460
They might have anxiety.
Who knows?

2006
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:02,680
I think sometimes they think it helped 
you know that to give the comedian 

2007
01:25:02,841 --> 01:25:04,090
something to do,
you know,

2008
01:25:04,091 --> 01:25:05,530
to.
I think they think it helps.

2009
01:25:05,531 --> 01:25:10,531
I don't think they're trying to stump 
the comic most of the time because me or

2010
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:11,680
you

2011
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:15,740
handling a hacker hacked hillary.
There's like a.

2012
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:18,350
it's like playing ping pong with a 
chicken.

2013
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:21,410
It's so fucking easy,
you know,

2014
01:25:21,411 --> 01:25:23,360
it's just.
But I just don't want to do it.

2015
01:25:23,630 --> 01:25:28,630
I don't want to spend any time doing it.
I spent all my time entertaining these 

2016
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:28,630
other bunch of people.

2017
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:30,560
I agree.
But occasionally I will.

2018
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,660
I will open to the fact that this is a 
weird exchange between a comedian and an

2019
01:25:35,661 --> 01:25:36,800
audience.
So weird exchange.

2020
01:25:36,801 --> 01:25:40,910
And occasionally people say Shit,
that's fucking funny.

2021
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,110
You know,
it is unfortunately,

2022
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:44,870
should be,
I should be more like that.

2023
01:25:44,871 --> 01:25:46,370
And I'm not,
I'm not.

2024
01:25:46,371 --> 01:25:48,380
I'm so.
I'm so fucking humorless.

2025
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,410
And uh,
because,

2026
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:51,520
because I,
you know,

2027
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:53,770
I bounced,
laughs off the laugh.

2028
01:25:53,771 --> 01:25:56,240
So that's what I'd do.
I'd pace rhythm,

2029
01:25:56,241 --> 01:25:56,930
timing,
boom,

2030
01:25:56,931 --> 01:25:57,380
boom,
boom.

2031
01:25:57,620 --> 01:26:02,620
So I'm going to start you here.
I'm going to dribble you to be slamming 

2032
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:03,230
you,
but if you stopped,

2033
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:06,540
I gotta go.
Okay.

2034
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:11,590
Fuck you're right.
And I'm going to start dribbling down 

2035
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:11,590
here,
but I'll get there quick.

2036
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:12,090
But I mean that just so it,
I,

2037
01:26:12,091 --> 01:26:17,091
I,
it always makes me mad and it shouldn't 

2038
01:26:17,091 --> 01:26:17,780
make me mad.
That shouldn't be the reaction,

2039
01:26:17,781 --> 01:26:19,190
but it does,
it makes me mad.

2040
01:26:19,191 --> 01:26:21,680
It makes me mad because I,
I have what I want.

2041
01:26:22,330 --> 01:26:23,990
Right.
And you're fucking it up.

2042
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:25,430
And uh,

2043
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,900
that definitely does happen.
That happens too.

2044
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:34,210
I just think every now and then someone 
says some funny shit.

2045
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:36,830
You're right.
I should,

2046
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:39,100
I should like the fuck up.
I'm a fucking comedian.

2047
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:44,490
One joke is,
is one time one of the best hackles 

2048
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:44,490
ever.
It was in New Jersey.

2049
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:46,930
I was doing a theater in Jersey and I 
had this one joke,

2050
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:50,500
we're about a Kim Kardashian meeting the
aliens.

2051
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:51,430
And I'm like,
well,

2052
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:53,650
who do you think is the most famous 
woman in the world?

2053
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:59,130
And this guy goes,
your mother and is the way said it was 

2054
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:00,550
perfect timing.
Or maybe he might've said,

2055
01:27:00,551 --> 01:27:01,720
your mom,
your mom.

2056
01:27:01,721 --> 01:27:04,690
I think you said your mom was like,
this is fucking hilarious.

2057
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,510
Your mind anytime you can say your mom,
was he wrong?

2058
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:12,810
That's funny.
I mean that's 80 percent of the banter 

2059
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:13,240
that already should fear and I have with
each other.

2060
01:27:13,241 --> 01:27:14,950
Was it your mom that sucked all those 
dicks?

2061
01:27:14,951 --> 01:27:15,650
No.
Okay.

2062
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:23,790
The guy never handled again.
It was the one hackle in one show where 

2063
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:23,790
it's like,
perfect.

2064
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:25,870
He went in like a Ninja.
He dropped a nuclear bomb.

2065
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:28,900
Boom.
Your mom and gotta laugh.

2066
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:29,440
You gotta laugh

2067
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:31,640
now.
Did you tell him that?

2068
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:34,300
Don't try it again.
The admitted.

2069
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:36,830
It was really funny.
Whenever you can say that,

2070
01:27:36,831 --> 01:27:38,720
that's fucking.
I want to get why I can't do that,

2071
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:41,060
but I sure can't.
It just makes me,

2072
01:27:41,061 --> 01:27:43,880
it just pisses me off sometimes.
I agree.

2073
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:46,220
I agree.
I'm not a heckler supporter,

2074
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,740
but I'm not.
I'm just saying just like this is what a

2075
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:54,860
live show is really some weird 
interaction.

2076
01:27:54,861 --> 01:27:59,861
Right?
And I think people like to know that 

2077
01:27:59,861 --> 01:27:59,861
you're right there.
Well,

2078
01:27:59,861 --> 01:28:02,420
when I'd been doing standup for for six 
years and I was headlining comedy clubs,

2079
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:07,450
I prayed to God,
somebody would heckle me because I 

2080
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:07,940
couldn't get to 45 minutes without it.
So,

2081
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:13,170
you know,
I needed to about four or five minutes 

2082
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:15,090
of Jabber and I asked him how he sees 
where they're from and,

2083
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:15,660
and,
and,

2084
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:20,830
and uh,
which is pure third grade comedy and uh,

2085
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:23,570
and I'm clearly a fourth grader.

2086
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:31,170
How long is it before someone does a 
Hologram show where you go to a theater 

2087
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:36,670
and the holograms are so good that it 
looks like it's already there,

2088
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:38,770
but you are running on another side of 
the planet,

2089
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,060
right?
It's already there.

2090
01:28:40,061 --> 01:28:40,810
Do you think so?
Yeah.

2091
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,040
They are.
It's unbidden Bev on,

2092
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:43,640
uh,
uh,

2093
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:44,270
how to,
uh,

2094
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:49,320
whatever rodeo drive.
There's a company over there on Rodeo 

2095
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,931
drive that are doing the most amazing.
The thing is it's still needs to evolve,

2096
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:54,040
right?
You know,

2097
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:55,690
it's a,
it's a,

2098
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:57,240
like these,
um,

2099
01:28:57,310 --> 01:28:58,750
well anyway,
it still needs to evolve.

2100
01:28:59,110 --> 01:28:59,290
See

2101
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,260
when they did it on CNN,
when used,

2102
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:06,290
they used it for the elections one year 
they had like Wolf Blitzer in the 

2103
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:06,290
Hologram.
Right.

2104
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:07,860
Do you remember that Jamie?
What was that about?

2105
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:11,730
They tried that one time and then like 
this is freaking people the fuck out.

2106
01:29:11,731 --> 01:29:15,220
Like what do we star wars?
What is he going to be map now?

2107
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:18,240
That's what the fuck is wolf blitzer do 
it in a hologram.

2108
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:20,730
Can you just put a camera on them?
Wherever the fuck he is.

2109
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:23,670
Why do you have to show me a Hologram?
Like what's going on here?

2110
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,640
People just read right?
Well,

2111
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:30,870
but it's now they just can't do it for 
as long as they want to.

2112
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:35,300
So without it costing a gillion dollar.
So they eventually,

2113
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:40,460
you can do it on your fucking phone.
You can project an image of something 

2114
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:41,070
you're thinking right there in front of 
you.

2115
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:42,690
Look at this woman,
she's glowing.

2116
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,080
She's like,
help me Obi wan.

2117
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:49,340
You're my only hope is my pussy CNNS 
Jessica Yellen via Hologram from 

2118
01:29:50,221 --> 01:29:55,221
Chicago.
It's a really fucking cool looking 

2119
01:29:55,221 --> 01:29:55,221
Hologram,
but she's got a.

2120
01:29:55,221 --> 01:29:56,010
didn't even know we were watching 
something about holograms.

2121
01:29:58,130 --> 01:30:00,510
I thought you were talking to me.
You're watching television.

2122
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:01,470
Look at it.
It's right there.

2123
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:02,850
That's that woman.
That was the one.

2124
01:30:02,851 --> 01:30:04,950
They did it on CNN where they had her,
uh,

2125
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:08,220
as a,
this was a during the Mccain Obama.

2126
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,980
Oh Wow.
And she's a Hologram.

2127
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:14,360
He did this on CNN.
She's glowing like the applicant.

2128
01:30:14,361 --> 01:30:17,790
This is so freaky.
This is so like Saifai,

2129
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:20,460
like I think America is like,
no,

2130
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:22,320
no more of this.
You know what else it is.

2131
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:27,030
It's really bad radio because though 
nobody can see it.

2132
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:32,090
Yeah.
But there's a lot of people watching on 

2133
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:32,090
youtube too.
We'll tell them,

2134
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:32,250
okay,
this is also on.

2135
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:36,150
What are we going to tell Cnns Jessica 
yelling via Hologram.

2136
01:30:36,151 --> 01:30:38,190
Just Google that and you can watch this 
video.

2137
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:42,090
CNN hologram first is a video we're 
watching and you can play that,

2138
01:30:42,091 --> 01:30:46,380
record it and play it while you're 
listening to Joe and as Banter,

2139
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:47,550
let's just tell me what.

2140
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:50,280
Tell me what you're seeing.
Does it freak you out?

2141
01:30:50,330 --> 01:30:53,130
I see this person with this blue glow 
around them.

2142
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:55,860
Like there's some fucking alien.
What are they preparing us for?

2143
01:30:56,180 --> 01:31:01,180
Like money to me.
I don't want to go straight to Alex 

2144
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:02,880
Jones here,
but I would say that looks crazy.

2145
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:08,050
Yeah.
How long before people started doing 

2146
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,000
standup like that where the audience 
will heckle but it won't work because 

2147
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,091
you're not really there.
So it only works if everybody shut the 

2148
01:31:14,091 --> 01:31:15,320
fuck up.
Just keep on moving us through.

2149
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,690
Sometimes I feel like that.
Well what they'll do is they'll film you

2150
01:31:18,691 --> 01:31:23,160
doing us set somewhere in front of a 
crowd with this hologram thing,

2151
01:31:23,161 --> 01:31:24,210
projecting it.
So there'll be.

2152
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:27,430
You'll do a live show,
but the live show is only going to be,

2153
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:33,590
it'll be something that you can,
maybe I could be in your living room at 

2154
01:31:33,871 --> 01:31:35,950
some point that I,

2155
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:39,310
for a limited amount of

2156
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:40,540
dates.
No,

2157
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:45,270
still can if you have a lot of money.
But eventually,

2158
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,010
I mean,
I'm just saying,

2159
01:31:47,011 --> 01:31:48,580
where does it stop?
Where does it stop?

2160
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:53,600
If you can do that right there,
then eventually you will be able to do 

2161
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:53,600
it on a small scale.

2162
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,130
And uh,
uh,

2163
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:58,950
you know,
I,

2164
01:31:59,170 --> 01:31:59,830
my drone

2165
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:06,100
is a drone now that will follow you and 
take pictures of you or have you seen 

2166
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:06,130
that?
It's like it floats,

2167
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,350
floats above you and films,
films,

2168
01:32:08,351 --> 01:32:10,690
pictures of you.
So you didn't like film stuff?

2169
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,370
I have one.
You have one of those,

2170
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:13,450
what do you do with it?

2171
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:15,880
Well,
lately,

2172
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:18,310
now that I live at the montage in 
Beverly Hills,

2173
01:32:18,311 --> 01:32:22,240
I,
I flied down beverly drive and uh,

2174
01:32:22,241 --> 01:32:27,241
and take a,
just take footage of it and turn it 

2175
01:32:27,611 --> 01:32:32,611
around snapshots and show up.
But the thing is I used to live off of 

2176
01:32:32,941 --> 01:32:33,880
canyon,
right?

2177
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:37,030
So if it crashed,
it was just going to go into the canyon.

2178
01:32:37,031 --> 01:32:41,200
Now it goes into some kids had been 
fucking falls out of the sky,

2179
01:32:41,201 --> 01:32:43,210
right.
Fall never.

2180
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:48,550
But I still can't keep from thinking 
about it every once in awhile that it is

2181
01:32:48,551 --> 01:32:53,551
fucking weird.
You can just have a robot always 

2182
01:32:53,551 --> 01:32:56,740
looking.
You can go right over to the Beverly 

2183
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:56,740
Wilshire and just park it right in any 
window you want.

2184
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:59,230
And if those curtains are open and you 
want to watch those people,

2185
01:32:59,231 --> 01:33:02,770
fuck they're going to get pissed when 
they see that Guy Dale drone.

2186
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,290
But you know,
they don't know who's flying it.

2187
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:09,930
Oh,
what are we doing?

2188
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,880
And it goes 80 miles an hour so it will 
fall out of the sky here in a second.

2189
01:33:14,910 --> 01:33:18,450
It's going to fall out of the sky or the
new Gopro Jones a couple of weeks ago.

2190
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:23,990
Oh Shit.
They were over at baseball field and it 

2191
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:24,810
just took a nosedive.
Didn't hit anybody,

2192
01:33:25,290 --> 01:33:30,290
but he didn't follow up.
Don't really drive later on during the 

2193
01:33:30,290 --> 01:33:31,380
Christmas season.
Oh my God,

2194
01:33:31,381 --> 01:33:32,530
that's crazy.
Just happened.

2195
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:36,250
So that thing just fell out of this guy.
Did you see the one where the um,

2196
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:39,700
the guy that looks like bullshit to me,
I just happened.

2197
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,820
I'm pretty sure this looks like bullshit
though.

2198
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:46,830
This pose looks like bull shit.
Maybe I'm just too quick to call 

2199
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:47,610
bullshit.
But did you see that one where there was

2200
01:33:47,611 --> 01:33:52,611
a guy that was on the ski slopes and he 
was in some sort of Olympic competition 

2201
01:33:52,611 --> 01:33:54,750
or something and the drone fell behind 
him,

2202
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:56,260
like right behind him,
like

2203
01:33:56,790 --> 01:34:01,580
barely mentioned was a big drone.
Big Drum with a movie camera on.

2204
01:34:01,581 --> 01:34:02,110
Or here it is,

2205
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:05,280
is this guy's skin?
What is this competition,

2206
01:34:05,281 --> 01:34:07,760
Jamie?
The Olympics are so shit.

2207
01:34:07,761 --> 01:34:12,761
And look at that.
So he never saw it but it fell right 

2208
01:34:12,761 --> 01:34:12,761
behind the Mike.
Wait,

2209
01:34:12,761 --> 01:34:13,500
this is crazy.
I would've killed him.

2210
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,350
It probably would have fucked him up,
man.

2211
01:34:16,351 --> 01:34:20,280
Look at this with this thing and you've 
seen it in high speed.

2212
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:21,300
Whoa.
First of all,

2213
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,920
look at that watch.
Boom.

2214
01:34:23,070 --> 01:34:25,530
Right behind them.
And it looks like it's hard to tell.

2215
01:34:25,531 --> 01:34:30,531
We got back to them,
but it looks like just to get to about a

2216
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:32,460
billion pieces that would have fucking 
hurt,

2217
01:34:32,461 --> 01:34:36,360
like hell that hit him.
Yeah.

2218
01:34:36,361 --> 01:34:37,080
He can't do that.

2219
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:40,820
I'm going to quit flat it over beverly 
drive.

2220
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:49,060
I can tell him my gut when I'm doing 
something that if I shouldn't be doing 

2221
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:49,060
it,
you know,

2222
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:52,731
I got really do have a little signal 
inside of me that goes and that I rarely

2223
01:34:54,241 --> 01:34:55,800
listened to it.
I rarely do.

2224
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:57,740
And,
but yeah,

2225
01:34:57,850 --> 01:34:58,160
I think

2226
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:03,160
I probably got to quit.
Fly The drone up and down Rodeo drive 

2227
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:03,160
when I came here.
Even see it.

2228
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,170
You definitely don't have that robot 
monster flying in the sky,

2229
01:35:05,190 --> 01:35:07,900
dropping on people's heads up.
That thing.

2230
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:12,810
I took it to a.
we're actually a place where sturges is,

2231
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,120
uh,
the bike thing.

2232
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,540
Yeah.
Where is that a?

2233
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:19,980
Anyway,
there's a little town up there.

2234
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:23,910
A little casino town were deadwood.
Uh,

2235
01:35:24,330 --> 01:35:25,560
is uh,
it,

2236
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:27,740
it was,
I think it is dead wood.

2237
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:29,440
How do I not know where?
Sturgis's where is it?

2238
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:32,100
It's in Idaho,
Dakota,

2239
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:33,630
South Dakota,
right.

2240
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:36,530
People in Idaho.
We're not fucking South Dakota pro.

2241
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,310
Yeah.
So it's like a,

2242
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:41,400
that sturgis the big motorcycle thing,
right?

2243
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:42,960
Where everybody gets together and they 
just,

2244
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,750
I mean,
there's a million things,

2245
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:46,680
I mean,
a million people.

2246
01:35:46,681 --> 01:35:48,260
This is it.
That is insane.

2247
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:51,810
See how beautiful this little charming 
little streets been like this except for

2248
01:35:51,811 --> 01:35:54,420
the pavement for 1785.

2249
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:59,450
Holy Shit.
It's always been intact because it's 

2250
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:01,320
always been a town that always made 
money and doing something.

2251
01:36:01,321 --> 01:36:04,920
So a big gold town.
But so it's all in tact.

2252
01:36:04,921 --> 01:36:09,180
So this is all going uphill where he's 
going right now and uh,

2253
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:14,440
and it keeps going up hill for way.
And then back up to the left is way up a

2254
01:36:15,811 --> 01:36:20,811
hill is the hotel where I'm at.
So I'm going to take my drone and I 

2255
01:36:20,811 --> 01:36:25,790
wanted to shoot.
I want to go down that strip and chute 

2256
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:25,790
that street,
you know,

2257
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:29,880
just from one end to the other.
And I had a spare battery in my pocket.

2258
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:34,350
And so I took it out front and I took it
off from there and I just kind of walked

2259
01:36:34,351 --> 01:36:38,540
it over like I was flying a kite and I 
get up there and uh,

2260
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:43,660
and I send it down the street,
I just flat down there just for a 

2261
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:43,890
practice run and it's,
you know,

2262
01:36:43,891 --> 01:36:45,920
almost a mile,
uh,

2263
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:48,600
and then red flat back up and,
and,

2264
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:53,630
uh,
and then a flat back down there and get 

2265
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:56,460
in while it's flying a this really good 
looking girl goes,

2266
01:36:56,790 --> 01:37:01,790
oh,
you're the one with the drone scaring 

2267
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:01,790
everybody.

2268
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:01,790
And I said,
the kids love it.

2269
01:37:04,290 --> 01:37:07,500
Then I looked back around and it wasn't 
there,

2270
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,890
the drone was gone.
And uh,

2271
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:12,430
and then,
uh,

2272
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:16,890
I start running down that hill.
I mean,

2273
01:37:16,891 --> 01:37:19,200
just kind of walking fast,
going where is it?

2274
01:37:19,470 --> 01:37:20,370
And then I,
uh,

2275
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:22,400
and then I send it up,
you know,

2276
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:23,340
because you get it up,
but,

2277
01:37:23,341 --> 01:37:25,110
you know,
go straight up until you can see it.

2278
01:37:25,111 --> 01:37:26,380
And it wasn't,
that wouldn't happen.

2279
01:37:26,381 --> 01:37:30,750
I was walking down and then I looked.
And once the battery is so low,

2280
01:37:30,751 --> 01:37:35,751
it takes,
it just takes over itself and takes us 

2281
01:37:35,751 --> 01:37:36,240
back to where you started from it.
It says,

2282
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:39,150
you know,
take him back to the home base,

2283
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:43,530
which is right in front of that really 
busy hotel.

2284
01:37:43,531 --> 01:37:45,900
It's going to come into my little drones
going to come drop it in.

2285
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:51,000
So I got to just have.
And I'm a downhill guy.

2286
01:37:51,001 --> 01:37:54,750
I'm not an uphill guy.
And I see the drones flying over my head

2287
01:37:54,751 --> 01:37:56,400
towards hotel.
I can't stop it.

2288
01:37:56,401 --> 01:37:58,390
I'm totally out of control and I'm just,

2289
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:02,500
uh Huh.

2290
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,040
I can't.
I mean,

2291
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,490
I can't stop.
I got to get there.

2292
01:38:05,491 --> 01:38:07,560
I got to beat the fucking thing to the,
to the,

2293
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:10,200
to the fucking hotel.
And I don't,

2294
01:38:11,070 --> 01:38:14,240
but it doesn't matter because it goes 
down about an hour,

2295
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:19,360
you know,
just comes in and really slow and just 

2296
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:19,360
lands.
And uh,

2297
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,340
so I'm like bent over holding a chair.
Just,

2298
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:22,580
uh,
uh,

2299
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:24,120
I mean,
this is,

2300
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,720
this is out of breath as I've ever been 
in my life.

2301
01:38:27,721 --> 01:38:28,440
Just,
uh,

2302
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:30,690
and uh,
this guy goes,

2303
01:38:30,970 --> 01:38:35,970
he's anyway,
I could get a picture of me while I'm 

2304
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:35,970
dying.
Is that what?

2305
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:41,740
So those are their drones that can 
navigate around trees and things.

2306
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,400
These won't hit a wall if come near.
Yeah,

2307
01:38:47,570 --> 01:38:49,560
it'll,
if you have that.

2308
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:52,760
What are we doing?
Ron White,

2309
01:38:52,761 --> 01:38:57,200
why the fuck are we allowing these 
flying robots to be?

2310
01:38:57,370 --> 01:38:58,030
Was that big

2311
01:38:58,090 --> 01:39:03,090
case in Texas?
My son was telling me about it where 

2312
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:05,281
this guy was a flu is drone into another
guy's yard and he shot it with a shotgun

2313
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:07,540
and he's like,
well,

2314
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:09,440
you're filming my family.
And um,

2315
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:12,310
and so now it's,
you know,

2316
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:14,800
who's at fault.
He didn't own that airspace.

2317
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:16,860
I may send,
seems like you don't,

2318
01:39:16,890 --> 01:39:18,400
a foot or two of it,
right,

2319
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,840
of your own airspace.

2320
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:25,490
Totally new dilemma.
And it's one more piece of technology 

2321
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:26,610
that brings us like weirdly more 
connected,

2322
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:29,070
some sort of strange,
almost forced way.

2323
01:39:29,071 --> 01:39:33,810
Like now we thought the only way to get 
around was essentially by being on foot.

2324
01:39:33,811 --> 01:39:38,130
So you can put up a fence.
But now if you can fly in three d space,

2325
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:39,270
well,
um,

2326
01:39:39,271 --> 01:39:41,600
where am I allowed to go?
Where am I not allowed to go?

2327
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:46,810
Right?
I owe you allowed to fly over anybody's 

2328
01:39:46,810 --> 01:39:46,810
house.
How does that work?

2329
01:39:46,810 --> 01:39:50,841
And as technology gets closer and closer
and closer and closer to whatever the 

2330
01:39:50,841 --> 01:39:55,071
fuck the singularity is,
we're going to probably physically be 

2331
01:39:55,071 --> 01:39:55,380
able to do that.
See what?

2332
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,190
Right?
Right now,

2333
01:39:56,191 --> 01:40:01,191
we can't physically fly around.
It's too difficult to have some sort of 

2334
01:40:01,191 --> 01:40:01,191
a jet pack

2335
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:02,740
situation.
Listen,

2336
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:06,980
those empty promises rang hollow years 
ago.

2337
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:08,990
The jet packs

2338
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:11,380
they did,
but as technology improves,

2339
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:16,800
there's a possibility,
there's a possibility within our 

2340
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:16,800
lifetime,
have some,

2341
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:21,120
some sort of propulsion system that 
works on some sort of a vast that you 

2342
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,120
would wear.

2343
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:25,270
It's totally yours.
All you gotta do to see what's gonna 

2344
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:25,450
happen the next hundred years is look at
the last hundred years.

2345
01:40:25,451 --> 01:40:26,460
And,
and uh,

2346
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:30,970
and that kind of momentum is going to 
continue straight on until this,

2347
01:40:30,971 --> 01:40:35,971
it looks like an antique.
Why did they ever do it this way?

2348
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:39,760
One hundred percent.
Everything we're doing is stupid.

2349
01:40:40,090 --> 01:40:45,090
Everything.
So Ron gotten a car and drove and they 

2350
01:40:47,381 --> 01:40:49,200
did what they meant,
you know,

2351
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:52,300
I don't know what it's going to be,
but yeah man,

2352
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:53,980
these,
this is like the

2353
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,940
strangest times ever.
I really feel like every day it feels so

2354
01:40:57,941 --> 01:41:00,570
strange like the,
the,

2355
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:03,490
the fact that Donald Trump is really the
president.

2356
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,640
Like,
that feels so strange.

2357
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:08,060
Yeah.
You know,

2358
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:08,750
I,
I didn't,

2359
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:11,640
I didn't vote for the president elect 
and uh,

2360
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:16,990
uh,
but I did get my tax estimates two days 

2361
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:17,880
ago and when I looked at it,
I was like,

2362
01:41:17,881 --> 01:41:22,881
go trump now.
I don't mean to say that I agree with 

2363
01:41:22,881 --> 01:41:24,210
anything he's ever said to live,
but,

2364
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:26,130
you know,
I don't know how these,

2365
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:32,030
how these really risk either getting 
away with paying three percent and I 

2366
01:41:32,030 --> 01:41:34,080
play paid 34 percent tax on this money 
and,

2367
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:35,710
and uh,
and uh,

2368
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:36,300
you know,
then,

2369
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:37,110
you know,
well,

2370
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,790
he did get elected.
So,

2371
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:44,240
you know,
I am going to get the benefits of those 

2372
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:44,240
tax breaks.
I wouldn't trade my country for it,

2373
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:44,900
but I'll take them.

2374
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:49,340
It's just fascinating because he's the 
first truly famous,

2375
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:53,030
like super famous guy who ran for 
president and one,

2376
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:58,060
no Reagan,
I don't think Reagan can fuck trump and 

2377
01:41:58,060 --> 01:41:59,120
the super famous to park on Reagan with 
a movie star Dude.

2378
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:04,450
There was a movie star and back when 
they had televisions that when I was,

2379
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:05,070
that was

2380
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:10,430
six or whatever it was.
I don't remember.

2381
01:42:10,431 --> 01:42:11,030
I don't remember

2382
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:16,280
that was either,
but I remember I was not good with 

2383
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:18,391
numbers.
It definitely wasn't voting age during 

2384
01:42:18,391 --> 01:42:20,400
their deed administration.
I think Reagan was as big a star as 

2385
01:42:20,471 --> 01:42:25,471
trump.
Is that apprentice celebrity apprentice 

2386
01:42:25,471 --> 01:42:25,710
show that was a big world

2387
01:42:26,030 --> 01:42:26,860
wide?
No.

2388
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:28,450
Worldwide.
No,

2389
01:42:28,451 --> 01:42:30,030
but us wise,
yes,

2390
01:42:30,031 --> 01:42:33,180
I am absolutely every bit as famous and 
uh,

2391
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:35,090
and,
and so it was a source of anger,

2392
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:38,340
swartz for short of sorts and ran for 
president.

2393
01:42:38,341 --> 01:42:40,620
He was allowed to.
He's not allowed to because he's born in

2394
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:44,760
Austria.
He'd went fucking when I think it went,

2395
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:50,390
I think,
I think if trump can win for short 

2396
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:50,390
swartz Nigger,
and I think he does.

2397
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:52,110
Todd is very important,
uh,

2398
01:42:52,111 --> 01:42:52,530
that,
uh,

2399
01:42:52,531 --> 01:42:54,510
that I think changed the lives of a lot 
of people.

2400
01:42:54,511 --> 01:42:59,511
You can unfuck the babysitter can do it.
You can't have a babysitter,

2401
01:43:00,930 --> 01:43:05,930
you can't.
It is what it Adele fuck the babysitter 

2402
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:05,930
is what it is.
Look what can happen,

2403
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:07,170
but people still love them.
They know what he is.

2404
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:08,980
He's a,
you know,

2405
01:43:09,210 --> 01:43:10,650
that's all he,
he,

2406
01:43:10,830 --> 01:43:15,830
he smokes cigars at this place where I 
smoke cigars sometimes as I'm walking 

2407
01:43:15,830 --> 01:43:16,270
out of a building.
I said,

2408
01:43:16,271 --> 01:43:18,350
hey governor,
he didn't say anything

2409
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:21,720
when you still call him governor.
I mean,

2410
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:23,500
I would call them whatever you want,
sir.

2411
01:43:23,501 --> 01:43:26,350
I met him once.
I think I probably called him brother.

2412
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:29,020
Everybody brother.
Right.

2413
01:43:29,410 --> 01:43:31,030
But uh,
he was super cool.

2414
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:32,410
I met him at the,
uh,

2415
01:43:32,411 --> 01:43:34,060
UFC.
I was like,

2416
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:35,080
I'm shaking his hand.
I'm like,

2417
01:43:35,081 --> 01:43:38,230
God damn shaking hands with 
motherfucking sports negar.

2418
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:39,800
It's one of those weird ones.
Yeah.

2419
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:41,440
Certain people you meet and you go,
whoa.

2420
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:43,120
Certain people you meet and you're like,

2424
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:50,650
you know.
Right.

2425
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:56,660

2432
01:44:04,430 --> 01:44:05,170

01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:13,280
Jack Nicholson though the actor,
like if you met and he's alive.

2436
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:15,440
He is alive to all these people are 
alive.

2437
01:44:15,441 --> 01:44:16,910
Josef.
And that's what I'm saying.

2438
01:44:17,670 --> 01:44:21,530
I knew somebody died,
configured which golfer it was.

2439
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,590
But I'm like,
that's one you,

2440

01:44:32,661 --> 01:44:33,010

2444
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:35,740
through our group at Bel Air one time I 
was playing and go doc.

2445
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:40,760
And uh,
him and Joe Pesci played through our 

2446
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:40,920
group.
What was that like?

2447
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:42,070
You know,
what they,

2448
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:42,570
they,
you know,

2449
01:44:42,571 --> 01:44:47,571
they just,
they just played through our group who 

2450
01:44:47,571 --> 01:44:49,551
was a par three that uh,
I played the course a lot with doc and 

2451
01:44:49,551 --> 01:44:50,070
uh,
and then,

2452
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,560
but they were,
they turned around,

2453
01:44:52,590 --> 01:44:54,590
you know,
they both gave you the movie star Look,

2454
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:55,550
you know,
and uh,

2455
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:58,290
you know,
it wasn't much,

2456
01:44:58,291 --> 01:45:02,610
but it was definitely a to really,
really,

2457
01:45:02,611 --> 01:45:04,600
really cool famous people,
you know.

2458
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:09,840
So it's,
it's not often I spazz out at,

2459
01:45:09,841 --> 01:45:11,970
uh,
about meeting somebody,

2460
01:45:11,971 --> 01:45:14,270
but I was in the,
I was the,

2461
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:19,520
the grand marshal at the Talladega and 
Margo saying their national anthem.

2462
01:45:21,031 --> 01:45:26,031
So we were like the king and queen of 
the Talladega speedway that weekend and 

2463
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:31,580
they were filming a talented and the ice
was about to come out and Pharaoh was 

2464
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:35,820
there and uh,
we went to this dinner was a buffet,

2465
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:38,190
but by all these famous chefs supposed 
to be really,

2466
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:42,570
really nice and he was in line and I 
just started walking towards him.

2467
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:48,520
I had nothing to say.
I had no plan I had.

2468
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:52,680
And then I just stopped myself and Ron,
would you go sit down?

2469
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:56,290
Jesus Christ?
But I'm such a huge fan of

2470
01:45:59,240 --> 01:45:59,820
and I mean,
I,

2471
01:45:59,821 --> 01:46:01,800
you know,
I might know some other famous people in

2472
01:46:01,801 --> 01:46:03,520
it,
but you know,

2473
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:04,610
feral,
you know,

2474
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:05,460
is a,
that's a,

2475
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,510
that's a big deal.
And you know,

2476
01:46:06,511 --> 01:46:07,120
who else I,

2477
01:46:08,890 --> 01:46:10,530
every time I'm around him,
I know it.

2478
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:15,540
I've been around him several times and 
is a Dan Akroyd and every time I'm 

2479
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:20,281
around Dan I say something completely 
fucking stupid because I'm just a 

2480
01:46:20,471 --> 01:46:22,440
gigantic.
I mean I've,

2481
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:25,570
I couldn't even tell you how big an 
ackroyd fan I am.

2482
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:28,410
He's going to be that socking blues 
brothers.

2483
01:46:28,450 --> 01:46:33,450
He's,
well he's Dan Akroyd and come on right 

2484
01:46:33,450 --> 01:46:33,450
now and,
and,

2485
01:46:33,450 --> 01:46:34,870
but,
but that was when I was stopped.

2486
01:46:34,871 --> 01:46:37,660
We were stopping parties to play this 
stuff,

2487
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:38,390
you know,
so easily.

2488
01:46:38,410 --> 01:46:39,980
Anyway,
stop in parts.

2489
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:41,180
So he's an I.
Yeah,

2490
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:43,990
there'll be a party going on Saturday 
night.

2491
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:49,330
It was stop it and turn it on Saturday 
night live and watch a Belushi and Bill 

2492
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:54,810
Murray and,
and a holiday.

2493
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:56,560
Anyway,
it was amazing.

2494
01:46:56,590 --> 01:46:58,410
And,
but every time I'm around him,

2495
01:46:58,411 --> 01:47:00,660
I always say something just.
I mean,

2496
01:47:01,190 --> 01:47:06,190
I know I haven't had,
it's just like the most unimpressive I 

2497
01:47:06,190 --> 01:47:08,200
could possibly fucking be.
And uh,

2498
01:47:10,570 --> 01:47:12,940
I'm a,
I'm a comic and he's like,

2499
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,360
yeah,
you told me that last time.

2500
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:18,050
Be Like,
oh,

2501
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:18,410
come on,

2502
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:20,920
give me something.
There's this fucking interview that they

2503
01:47:20,921 --> 01:47:24,220
did recently with Jerry Lewis.
It is hilarious.

2504
01:47:24,221 --> 01:47:29,221
Have you seen Jamie?
Apparently the annoyed the fuck out of 

2505
01:47:29,221 --> 01:47:29,221
him,
right?

2506
01:47:29,221 --> 01:47:32,881
Like Jerry Lewis in his nineties and 
they were in a bunch of people that are 

2507
01:47:32,881 --> 01:47:37,621
in their nineties.
It's still work and they interviewed 

2508
01:47:37,621 --> 01:47:40,351
Jerry Lewis and I guess they had annoyed
him so bad and bringing in a bunch of 

2509
01:47:41,111 --> 01:47:43,450
assistants and lights and cameras and 
shit.

2510
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:46,450
So Jerry Lewis gave them like one word 
answers.

2511
01:47:46,451 --> 01:47:47,770
Yes.
No,

2512
01:47:48,190 --> 01:47:53,190
it didn't play out with these people.
And the guy starts a weird nat will play

2513
01:47:54,671 --> 01:47:57,430
a little bit over here.
You can see what is it?

2514
01:47:57,431 --> 01:47:59,200
The Hollywood reporter?
Is that WHO's doing it?

2515
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:00,920
Is it going to come in through my 
headphones?

2516
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:02,410
Yeah.
You'll hear it through your headphones.

2517
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:03,330
This,
it's,

2518
01:48:03,730 --> 01:48:05,530
it's fucking hilarious,
man.

2519
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:09,190
Seven painfully awkward minutes with 
Jerry Lewis.

2520
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,230
People were still working in their 
night.

2521
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:16,980
Have you ever thought about retiring?
Why was there never a moment that you 

2522
01:48:19,061 --> 01:48:24,061
thought it might be time to retire?
You would want to come from?

2523
01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:29,800
I come from a generation and a little 
older and I think of Bob Hope.

2524
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:33,570
George Burns Sinatra.
Fuck,

2525
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:39,670
love there.
Do you see similarities with them?

2526
01:48:39,790 --> 01:48:40,960
None.
None.

2527
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:46,470
What do you think drives people like you
and then to want to keep working because

2528
01:48:48,970 --> 01:48:53,370
we do it well.
And how about um,

2529
01:48:55,010 --> 01:48:55,640
what,
um,

2530
01:48:56,210 --> 01:49:00,740
what's different about performing now 
for you than say 20 years ago?

2531
01:49:00,741 --> 01:49:02,780
How is it,
how is it different for you?

2532
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,170
Not,
not at all.

2533
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:05,800
Not at all.

2534
01:49:06,110 --> 01:49:08,180
I kind of see his point.
I see both of them.

2535
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,520
No,
but he's pointing to Jerry's point.

2536
01:49:13,150 --> 01:49:18,150
This guy's asking ridiculously stupid 
questions to one of the most famous 

2537
01:49:18,150 --> 01:49:22,480
comedians are convenient for certainly 
the best comedic actor,

2538
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,670
one of the best comedic actors that ever
lived.

2539
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:30,300
And he said,
why aren't you more like your dead 

2540
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:30,300
friends?
Oh,

2541
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:30,790
well,

2542
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:32,860
because I'm not fucking dead.

2543
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:37,020
Yeah.
I think.

2544
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:42,260
I think with a guy like that,
if you're going to have a conversation 

2545
01:49:42,260 --> 01:49:45,171
with them,
it's going to have to be like in a 

2546
01:49:45,171 --> 01:49:47,190
podcast form and it's going to have to 
be with someone who really respects,

2547
01:49:47,710 --> 01:49:49,150
you know,
you know,

2548
01:49:49,151 --> 01:49:54,151
someone who's going to have a 
conversation that at this point in his 

2549
01:49:54,151 --> 01:49:57,151
life,
after all the movies and all the stuff 

2550
01:49:57,151 --> 01:49:57,151
that guy's done,
he probably doesn't want.

2551
01:49:57,151 --> 01:49:58,810
He doesn't want to deal with any 
bullshit anymore.

2552
01:49:59,030 --> 01:50:02,020
You know,
it seems like to him it was like,

2553
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:03,700
this is stupid.
What the fuck am I doing?

2554
01:50:03,701 --> 01:50:07,080
Why am I doing?
Feels uninspired.

2555
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:08,610
You know,
what I did the other day,

2556
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:12,870
this was the worst decision I ever made.
Not the worst,

2557
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:18,170
but it be really bad when mother,
my mom's in town and we're staying at 

2558
01:50:18,411 --> 01:50:20,430
the montage because the house got 
destroyed.

2559
01:50:20,431 --> 01:50:21,690
And,
and,

2560
01:50:21,691 --> 01:50:24,180
uh,
and I'm like,

2561
01:50:24,181 --> 01:50:25,170
well,
what do you want to do?

2562
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:25,800
He goes,
well,

2563
01:50:25,801 --> 01:50:29,520
I've never been to the labrea tar pits 
and uh,

2564
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:30,360
and like,
well,

2565
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:33,240
that's Kinda like a puddle of mud.
Uh,

2566
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:35,340
with that.
Well,

2567
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:39,200
I'd like to go on one of those tour 
buses and uh,

2568
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:40,590
I'm like,
all right,

2569
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:42,610
well I'll take you on one of those tour 
buses,

2570
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:48,380
take you in.
So we go on the TMZ bus cause I saw the 

2571
01:50:50,071 --> 01:50:53,820
TMZ is the big double decker things,
but that's not their bus.

2572
01:50:54,150 --> 01:50:57,660
They advertised for TMZ on the side of 
those buses,

2573
01:50:57,661 --> 01:51:02,661
but their buses are little buses and 
they have a big bunch of television 

2574
01:51:02,701 --> 01:51:06,860
screens and they just blast all this 
footage of uh,

2575
01:51:06,861 --> 01:51:07,320
of the.

2576
01:51:07,590 --> 01:51:10,160
I mean everywhere you go.
What happened in there?

2577
01:51:10,161 --> 01:51:15,161
Every time Paris Hilton was on there 
show your real fucking loud.

2578
01:51:15,721 --> 01:51:16,650
Really,
really,

2579
01:51:16,651 --> 01:51:19,200
really annoying.
And I was like Mama,

2580
01:51:20,330 --> 01:51:23,760
I because we thought we were going to be
really passive,

2581
01:51:23,761 --> 01:51:24,470
you know,
like,

2582
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:27,630
and that's where Jerry Lewis live for 45
years.

2583
01:51:27,631 --> 01:51:30,670
And right there is where there's George 
Carlin with the house and there,

2584
01:51:30,690 --> 01:51:31,890
you know.
But no,

2585
01:51:31,891 --> 01:51:34,080
it was in your face loud.
He was like,

2586
01:51:34,081 --> 01:51:39,081
you were just forced to watch an episode
to TMZ and they,

2587
01:51:40,650 --> 01:51:45,650
somebody tied you to a fucking chair and
wouldn't let you go and just turned it 

2588
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:50,280
the fuck up.
That's how fucking annoying it was.

2589
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:51,780
And it just horrible,
horrible,

2590
01:51:51,781 --> 01:51:53,350
horrible.
And uh,

2591
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:57,450
so at one point in the tour they said,
we'll be passing the montage hotel.

2592
01:51:57,451 --> 01:51:58,230
And I'm like,
Hey,

2593
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:00,960
let's get off mom and she would get out 
of here.

2594
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:03,090
So we scooted off.
But it was,

2595
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:04,290
it was nightmare.
She was.

2596
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:07,380
And I liked those guys at TMZ when 
they're friends of mine.

2597
01:52:07,381 --> 01:52:08,150
But,
uh,

2598
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:12,210
would you please fucking turn it down?
My mother brought,

2599
01:52:12,211 --> 01:52:15,120
my mother,
brought my mom.

2600
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:18,530
I feel bad for the guy that was asking 
the questions to Jerry Lewis too because

2601
01:52:18,531 --> 01:52:20,570
he probably thought he would get to have
a nice,

2602
01:52:20,571 --> 01:52:23,980
friendly conversation with a legend.
Probably totally intimidated.

2603
01:52:23,981 --> 01:52:27,540
He's in Jerry Lewis's house having a 
conversation with them and he,

2604
01:52:27,590 --> 01:52:30,320
it,
it's going to that one answer.

2605
01:52:30,321 --> 01:52:32,270
One word answer place.
No.

2606
01:52:32,510 --> 01:52:37,510
Why?
You know that that was when he starts 

2607
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:37,510
doing that.
It's like you're in verbal combat,

2608
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:40,720
but listen to what the questions were,
questions guys,

2609
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:45,820
90 years old,
he's talking about why aren't you more 

2610
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:45,820
like dead?
I agree.

2611
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:48,140
That's what do you.
How do you answer that question?

2612
01:52:48,230 --> 01:52:51,590
It was a poorly designed conversation,
horrible,

2613
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:56,620
horribly designed conversation and it 
was obviously that's how Jerry Lewis 

2614
01:52:56,620 --> 01:53:00,371
felt and,
and you could tell the guy who was 

2615
01:53:00,371 --> 01:53:00,371
asking a question,
it was kind of,

2616
01:53:00,371 --> 01:53:01,520
you know,
it was treading on water,

2617
01:53:01,521 --> 01:53:04,160
is trying to figure out how to get the 
fuck through this while he's talking,

2618
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:05,720
living in and figure it out.

2619
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:06,260
No,
he didn't.

2620
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:08,760
He didn't figure it out.
He thought he should have met.

2621
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:12,290
Well,
he probably meant well and just ran into

2622
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:15,700
everything.
Preparedness.

2623
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:17,040
Unpreparedness.
Yeah.

2624
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:19,740
It's just,
that's a weird Gig to the,

2625
01:53:19,741 --> 01:53:24,741
the,
the ability to ad Lib and ask questions 

2626
01:53:24,741 --> 01:53:27,281
to some living legend like Jerry Lewis 
and just not realize while you're doing 

2627
01:53:27,281 --> 01:53:31,391
it in your narrative that you set up in 
your head as probably disrespectful to 

2628
01:53:31,391 --> 01:53:35,201
him because he's,
you're comparing him to all these dead 

2629
01:53:35,201 --> 01:53:35,201
people,
so why are you still working?

2630
01:53:35,201 --> 01:53:36,590
Why you're essentially saying that.
Catch that.

2631
01:53:37,130 --> 01:53:42,130
Abby that catch that,
it's got to be fucking why?

2632
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:45,560
You almost have to wonder why he decided
to do it.

2633
01:53:45,561 --> 01:53:47,120
I guess it's just the Hollywood 
reporter.

2634
01:53:47,121 --> 01:53:48,200
Right?
It's a big deal,

2635
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:49,500
you know?
Yeah.

2636
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:52,270
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

2637
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:52,760
I mean,
you know,

2638
01:53:52,761 --> 01:53:55,340
I don't know that maybe.
Does he still sell tickets?

2639
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:56,900
I don't know that he works.
Does he?

2640
01:53:56,901 --> 01:54:01,901
Does.
I think that's what the guy was talking 

2641
01:54:01,901 --> 01:54:03,551
about.
See if Jerry Lewis still has standup 

2642
01:54:03,551 --> 01:54:03,551
shows.
I think he had just got done.

2643
01:54:03,551 --> 01:54:03,770
Fuck,
I'd pay.

2644
01:54:03,890 --> 01:54:06,200
I'd pay to go see that.
Fuck.

2645
01:54:06,201 --> 01:54:07,320
Yeah.
That's uh,

2646
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:07,880
that's,
you know,

2647
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:12,940
I was bill,
Bill Burr and I had talked about going 

2648
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:13,610
to see bill cosby before the scandal 
broke,

2649
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:17,600
like,
and we had talked about going and either

2650
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:19,220
one of us flaked,
I don't remember what happened,

2651
01:54:19,221 --> 01:54:21,650
but bill wound up going when he was 
somewhere in California,

2652
01:54:21,651 --> 01:54:26,651
we're going to make a separate trip to 
vegas just to see a bill cosby and 

2653
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:27,220
burst.
Said he was fucking amazing.

2654
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:31,000
Said he was fucking amazing.
And then the scandal broke afterwards.

2655
01:54:31,270 --> 01:54:36,270
This touring stopped and they're like,
we just became a totally different 

2656
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:36,270
thing.
You know,

2657
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:40,060
we have that VIP company that we 
promoted,

2658
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:42,460
we do other people's be api stuff 
besides my head,

2659
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:47,470
we do other peoples and we had just had 
cosby this stuff breaks and he wouldn't 

2660
01:54:47,470 --> 01:54:48,590
be the perfect client for it because he,
you know,

2661
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:51,710
he's looking for trim anyway,
you know,

2662
01:54:51,711 --> 01:54:52,640
after the show.

2663
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:55,820
So he was going to want to hang and so 
it would've been a great.

2664
01:54:55,821 --> 01:55:00,821
Probably would have been our best client
and Aa still solved a lot of tickets 

2665
01:55:00,821 --> 01:55:03,350
after that.
Look at this and even with Jerry Lewis,

2666
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:05,030
Saturday,
November twelfth,

2667
01:55:05,031 --> 01:55:07,160
2016.
So real recent.

2668
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:09,530
The last shot could find listed.
Wow.

2669
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:14,560
That's a really recent chair of it.
Where was that international film 

2670
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:17,360
festival?
That was probably him talking about,

2671
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:20,480
which still would be fascinating.
Yeah,

2672
01:55:20,481 --> 01:55:23,100
that would be fascinating.
But I'm pretty sure he does stand up.

2673
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:26,840
I'm pretty sure Jerry Lewis still does 
some sort of a standup show.

2674
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:30,650
I think he had to show it.
Said that at the South Point and Vegas.

2675
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:33,400
Yeah.
I didn't have any recent shows listed or

2676
01:55:33,401 --> 01:55:33,830
any.
Oh,

2677
01:55:33,831 --> 01:55:35,300
when?
When was the last show?

2678
01:55:35,330 --> 01:55:40,330
There was a article from September,
so have some shows at the end of the 

2679
01:55:40,330 --> 01:55:40,330
pretty recently.
Yeah.

2680
01:55:40,330 --> 01:55:42,050
So within the last year he's still 
working.

2681
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:43,950
Ooh.

2682
01:55:45,630 --> 01:55:46,620
Yeah,
that's crazy.

2683
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:51,000
Crazy.
I mean if you go back and watch like the

2684
01:55:51,001 --> 01:55:54,990
nutty professor like we were talking 
about and how that influence dice,

2685
01:55:55,340 --> 01:56:00,340
you know,
if you go back and watch that and just 

2686
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:00,340
realize there had been nothing before 
this,

2687
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:05,600
you know,
like it was Charlie Chapman and there's 

2688
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:06,630
a few chaplain wouldn't say,
Oh my God,

2689
01:56:06,631 --> 01:56:08,220
I'm an idiot.
Don't listen to me.

2690
01:56:08,221 --> 01:56:11,760
I'll stop now.
But three stooges,

2691
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:13,800
you know,
there was some fucking great shit,

2692
01:56:15,570 --> 01:56:18,690
but God damn man,
those,

2693
01:56:18,870 --> 01:56:21,390
those guys were like real pioneers 
account.

2694
01:56:21,430 --> 01:56:25,920
How many decades ahead,
movie comedy been around back when Jerry

2695
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:26,970
Lewis was doing those movies?

2696
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:28,530
Well,
you know,

2697
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:31,090
it's,
you can look at it.

2698
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:32,730
Here's the thing,
the,

2699
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:37,750
uh,
some comics build bridges and most 

2700
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:42,201
comics walk across those bridges after 
they've already been built and it's 

2701
01:56:42,201 --> 01:56:45,800
substantially and set in stone.
So Louis certainly built a bridge that 

2702
01:56:47,371 --> 01:56:52,371
Jim Carrey walked across in Ballerina 
shoes and he knows it in and uh,

2703
01:56:52,910 --> 01:56:57,540
uh,
but because that extraordinary,

2704
01:56:58,350 --> 01:57:02,900
a comedic talent that comes out of those
two people are view,

2705
01:57:02,910 --> 01:57:06,030
so identifiable and uh,
you know,

2706
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:10,100
I think that Pat Paul's and were built a
bridge that uh,

2707
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:15,260
Steven Wright walked across.
Now that doesn't mean steven didn't do 

2708
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:16,800
it better,
but he didn't invent it.

2709
01:57:17,550 --> 01:57:21,390
But don't you think all of us are in,
in essence,

2710
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:22,270
in a,
in,

2711
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:27,220
in a way some sort of a group thing 
because we're all kinds of lily.

2712
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:28,380
Yeah,
absolutely.

2713
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:32,850
We're all kind of influenced by each 
other standards and what you appreciate,

2714
01:57:32,851 --> 01:57:35,460
like as a comic has been doing it for as
many years as you have.

2715
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:36,600
You know,
I'm,

2716
01:57:36,601 --> 01:57:38,830
I'm just two years after you.
It was a.

2717
01:57:39,410 --> 01:57:42,870
well why don't I start August 27th,
1988.

2718
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:44,340
So it's about two years after.
You

2719
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:51,740
mean,
which means we basically started the 

2720
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:51,740
same day?
Yeah,

2721
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:51,740
pretty much.
That's a,

2722
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:54,080
I started like literally a week apart 
from Greg Fitzsimmons.

2723
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:57,230
Do you know Greg?
I don't know him well,

2724
01:57:57,231 --> 01:58:00,110
but I,
we worked together somewhere and uh,

2725
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:02,780
and he's very funny.
He's fucking hilarious.

2726
01:58:02,781 --> 01:58:04,510
He's a smart dude.
Tell you what,

2727
01:58:04,530 --> 01:58:06,440
I tell people all the time and if you 
like,

2728
01:58:06,441 --> 01:58:11,441
standup comedy,
go to the comedy store and make a 

2729
01:58:11,441 --> 01:58:14,411
vacation around it and it goes it in 
there because people are going to come 

2730
01:58:14,411 --> 01:58:16,480
in and that room rattles,
rattles and you,

2731
01:58:16,481 --> 01:58:21,481
you better be prepared to do something 
or that you're not going to follow some 

2732
01:58:21,481 --> 01:58:22,210
of these fucking guys.
Uh,

2733
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:23,620
uh,
there,

2734
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:25,990
it's really,
really strong and,

2735
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:31,310
and it's fun.
That's what makes it so much fucking 

2736
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:31,760
fun.
Pirate ship fill with murderers.

2737
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:35,690
Kayla.
Kayla

2738
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:39,080
water fast.
You're going on after savages.

2739
01:58:39,910 --> 01:58:44,910
Jesus Christ,
but everybody's riding the wave of 

2740
01:58:44,910 --> 01:58:45,880
everybody else and it's an unbelievably 
supportive place.

2741
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:51,410
We stop and think about how much 
comradery and friendship there is 

2742
01:58:51,410 --> 01:58:54,451
between the convenience.
You would think if you get all these 

2743
01:58:54,451 --> 01:58:54,451
national comedians at tour all over the 
place,

2744
01:58:54,451 --> 01:58:55,110
you put them together.
Well,

2745
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:58,120
ego battles.
It's going to be weird that it's a total

2746
01:58:58,121 --> 01:59:00,520
opposite.
That places a love fest.

2747
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,010
Everybody's hugging everybody and high 
five.

2748
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:04,060
And then having drinks,

2749
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:06,730
I had a lot of fucking me,
I go on,

2750
01:59:06,731 --> 01:59:11,731
I do my time and uh,
but I tried to hit him as hard as I can 

2751
01:59:11,731 --> 01:59:14,821
right in the fucking mail and a and a 
because that's what I like to do is hit 

2752
01:59:18,281 --> 01:59:19,630
him right in the fucking mouth.
So.

2753
01:59:20,110 --> 01:59:25,110
And then I guarantee you if somebody's 
just got through it and him in the 

2754
01:59:25,110 --> 01:59:25,110
mouth.
So there's still.

2755
01:59:25,110 --> 01:59:27,280
I've been bled off their face when I 
get,

2756
01:59:27,281 --> 01:59:29,500
as my attorney did have in the mouth,
but I'll hit him in the mouth anyway.

2757
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:30,780
It.
But it's a,

2758
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:34,630
it's a,
the crowds that you get a hold of are so

2759
01:59:34,631 --> 01:59:39,631
alive.
I mean there's lots of swordfish on the 

2760
01:59:39,631 --> 01:59:41,680
end of a fucking line.
It just vibrates,

2761
01:59:41,681 --> 01:59:42,940
you know?
Joey

2762
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:46,690
was slaughtering so hard the other night
in the O,

2763
01:59:46,710 --> 01:59:50,050
r that I felt like I was having a 
religious experience.

2764
01:59:50,470 --> 01:59:55,470
I was in the back room with Joey Diaz 
was slaughtering his face was beet red.

2765
01:59:56,710 --> 02:00:01,510
He was screaming and I was like,
I was running out of air.

2766
02:00:01,511 --> 02:00:04,540
I was laughing so hard.
And I remember thinking like,

2767
02:00:04,541 --> 02:00:08,080
this is a special time,
this is a special place,

2768
02:00:08,110 --> 02:00:12,880
like this is a rare,
rare little jewel in the universe of all

2769
02:00:12,881 --> 02:00:15,310
the different performing arts at this 
one place.

2770
02:00:15,311 --> 02:00:18,220
It's just sort of fucking cracked down 
the focus.

2771
02:00:19,030 --> 02:00:19,940
I mean,
the other night,

2772
02:00:19,941 --> 02:00:22,390
Chappelle,
Chris rock bring up,

2773
02:00:22,391 --> 02:00:23,710
Chappelle,
Chappelle,

2774
02:00:23,711 --> 02:00:25,240
brought up Chris Rock rock right up.
Chappelle.

2775
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:30,710
What?
Neither one of them were even on the 

2776
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:30,930
schedule.
Chris Rock's pops in and brings up.

2777
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:33,660
That's what I have to help me with 
governor,

2778
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:38,670
the comedy store.
You know what you're going to see for 

2779
02:00:38,670 --> 02:00:40,961
your $15 crazy spot.
You're not going to see if you were 

2780
02:00:40,961 --> 02:00:43,010
going to pay those guys to put a show on
for you that you just saw tonight.

2781
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,320
It's $17,000
a ticket.

2782
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:47,000
So,
or whatever it is.

2783
02:00:47,230 --> 02:00:48,350
It is expensive.

2784
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:52,500
It's also like a really like honestly 
critical place to shoot.

2785
02:00:52,770 --> 02:00:55,350
If your new stuff sucks,
I'll let you know.

2786
02:00:55,410 --> 02:00:55,890
Oh yeah.

2787
02:00:58,470 --> 02:01:01,400
Uh,
when I first started here,

2788
02:01:01,850 --> 02:01:05,250
I really had a great little burst of 
material that I really like and,

2789
02:01:05,290 --> 02:01:10,290
and,
and it's all the front end of my show 

2790
02:01:10,290 --> 02:01:12,641
now.
It's about 20 minutes long or that I 

2791
02:01:12,641 --> 02:01:13,340
want for the front end of the show.
That's what I want.

2792
02:01:13,341 --> 02:01:15,470
That's what I'm doing now in the front 
end of my live show.

2793
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:19,180
And uh,
so it's.

2794
02:01:21,110 --> 02:01:25,110
But now it seems like I'm just playing 
around with the order that stuff to just

2795
02:01:25,170 --> 02:01:30,170
see where it works the best and just how
to just fucking really slap him in the 

2796
02:01:30,170 --> 02:01:30,380
face with it.
And uh,

2797
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:35,440
because eventually over time your act,
we'll get into a place where it does 

2798
02:01:36,051 --> 02:01:40,340
drift into the spot it needs to be in 
but don't have that kind of time.

2799
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:45,080
So I need to look at it and do it 
different ways and see where it needs to

2800
02:01:45,081 --> 02:01:50,081
be a to just slap the fuck out of which 
is my only go is the slap the fuck out 

2801
02:01:53,061 --> 02:01:54,860
of them.
And uh,

2802
02:01:55,210 --> 02:02:00,210
and when I can't do that anymore,
I'll keep doing it for a little couple 

2803
02:02:00,210 --> 02:02:01,370
of years.
He slapped the fuck out of him and I,

2804
02:02:01,371 --> 02:02:03,470
I enjoy watching you slap the fuck out 
of him,

2805
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:05,600
but I enjoy watching you slap the fuck 
out of.

2806
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:08,060
I feel inspired.
You know,

2807
02:02:08,061 --> 02:02:13,061
like you're going to walk,
you ain't gonna just waltz on behind 

2808
02:02:13,061 --> 02:02:13,061
Rogan and I did,
I,

2809
02:02:13,061 --> 02:02:14,580
you know,
you know how big a fan I am of years and

2810
02:02:14,650 --> 02:02:15,710
it,
and I didn't,

2811
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:16,450
you know,
I,

2812
02:02:16,890 --> 02:02:20,720
I know exactly who you are and know 
exactly who you are and not as much as I

2813
02:02:20,721 --> 02:02:22,340
do now,
but you know,

2814
02:02:22,341 --> 02:02:27,341
uh,
but I really sit to stand up in Atlanta 

2815
02:02:27,341 --> 02:02:31,130
one time as a feature act in long time 
ago and he just really fucking tore this

2816
02:02:31,131 --> 02:02:32,270
crowd up and I was like,
ah,

2817
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:33,440
this guy's really good.

2818
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:35,530
And uh,
so then,

2819
02:02:35,570 --> 02:02:40,570
you know,
I don't like you hanging out there and 

2820
02:02:40,570 --> 02:02:40,570
watch,
you know,

2821
02:02:40,570 --> 02:02:44,170
but sometimes you're right in front of 
me or right after me and uh,

2822
02:02:44,290 --> 02:02:45,890
and,
and I just got,

2823
02:02:45,891 --> 02:02:47,990
you know,
is huge respect.

2824
02:02:47,991 --> 02:02:48,560
I mean,
it just,

2825
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:53,720
it's so much fun to watch.
It's a [inaudible] he do physical 

2826
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:56,891
things.
I couldn't even do much less get the 

2827
02:02:56,891 --> 02:02:56,891
words out while you're doing them,
you know,

2828
02:02:56,891 --> 02:03:00,010
the uh,
but it's just great writing and that's 

2829
02:03:00,010 --> 02:03:00,920
cool.
That's cool.

2830
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:01,940
Well,
thanks man.

2831
02:03:01,941 --> 02:03:06,941
I feel the same way about you and I 
would say that whether or not you just 

2832
02:03:06,941 --> 02:03:07,450
said something nice to me,
but you know,

2833
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:08,070
it's,
I'm,

2834
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:10,690
I'm honored to be friends with you.
Bullshit.

2835
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:12,450
As a comic.
I'm like,

2836
02:03:12,570 --> 02:03:14,540
that's,
that's an honor,

2837
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:15,290
you know?
Well,

2838
02:03:15,291 --> 02:03:15,770
um,
uh,

2839
02:03:16,230 --> 02:03:18,200
well,
since I'm now one of the Godfather,

2840
02:03:19,180 --> 02:03:24,180
the Godfather,
who's gonna like if you wanted to run 

2841
02:03:24,180 --> 02:03:27,941
for president of the comedy store,
he just got here and you'd win son of a 

2842
02:03:27,941 --> 02:03:27,941
bitch,
right?

2843
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:29,580
You can.
The uh,

2844
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:32,660
disrespectful went up against,
you know,

2845
02:03:32,850 --> 02:03:35,130
you'd with under.
No,

2846
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:38,950
your statesmen in the staff.
The voice wouldn't.

2847
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:41,960
Whatever.
Whenever a jammer Gra first met you.

2848
02:03:41,961 --> 02:03:43,160
He was asking me.
He goes,

2849
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:44,610
do you know Joe Rogan?
I was like,

2850
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:45,320
yeah.
He goes,

2851
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:46,520
what do you think about it?
Like,

2852
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:48,650
he's a great guy.
He's a great comedian.

2853
02:03:48,651 --> 02:03:50,300
That's what people don't know.
I mean,

2854
02:03:50,301 --> 02:03:52,210
a lot of people don't know,
but a lot of people do know,

2855
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:55,790
but a lot of people don't know that.
He's a great comedian.

2856
02:03:55,820 --> 02:03:57,170
Not a good comedian,
a great comedian.

2857
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:59,210
That's very nice.
I didn't know enough.

2858
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:01,630
They don't need to know anymore.
I'm good.

2859
02:04:02,090 --> 02:04:03,590
No,
you're a great comedian,

2860
02:04:03,690 --> 02:04:06,490
you know.
Okay.

2861
02:04:06,660 --> 02:04:08,570
All right.
Well I'm just saying that's fine.

2862
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:10,760
But uh,
but anyway,

2863
02:04:10,761 --> 02:04:12,530
that's just what I told him.
I appreciate that.

2864
02:04:12,531 --> 02:04:14,060
Uh,
and uh,

2865
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:15,950
and he said,
but he doesn't talk much.

2866
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:17,390
I'm like,
Huh,

2867
02:04:17,930 --> 02:04:22,930
you know,
it's like you guys were learning how to 

2868
02:04:22,930 --> 02:04:23,010
be boyfriends,
but he seems to get a,

2869
02:04:23,410 --> 02:04:25,430
you know,
I don't make small talk,

2870
02:04:25,431 --> 02:04:27,110
but I know,
you know,

2871
02:04:27,230 --> 02:04:28,790
that's what I tell him.
I said,

2872
02:04:28,791 --> 02:04:29,830
you know what,
you know,

2873
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,130
you're going to love this guy.
He's,

2874
02:04:31,190 --> 02:04:32,330
he's,
he's solid.

2875
02:04:32,331 --> 02:04:32,930
He's,
he's,

2876
02:04:32,990 --> 02:04:34,620
he's got a big heart.
He's,

2877
02:04:34,670 --> 02:04:37,100
he's right.
He's what we're looking for for friends.

2878
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:41,220
Oh Man,
this a love fest.

2879
02:04:42,290 --> 02:04:43,770
Love Fest.
Frond white.

2880
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:47,860
So now it's now,
now joe and I are fucking face timing.

2881
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:51,120
Jay is the gay is fucking three way in 
the world.

2882
02:04:51,870 --> 02:04:54,390
If we don't end up beating each other up
before Christmas,

2883
02:04:54,391 --> 02:04:55,110
I'll be shocked.

2884
02:04:55,140 --> 02:05:00,140
Facetime is a another level of 
commitment other than texting with 

2885
02:05:00,140 --> 02:05:00,630
friends.
If you start facetiming friends,

2886
02:05:00,631 --> 02:05:01,200
like,
Whoa,

2887
02:05:01,350 --> 02:05:02,370
right.
All right buddy.

2888
02:05:02,670 --> 02:05:03,470
He's got the body

2889
02:05:04,570 --> 02:05:09,570
set me up.
I wouldn't even do that with my wife 

2890
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:09,570
because I don't want to prove where I'm 
at.

2891
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:10,080
I don't want to.
Oh,

2892
02:05:10,081 --> 02:05:11,610
really?
To turn around and show me the

2893
02:05:11,750 --> 02:05:14,620
Christian an android phone.
They can't communicate with each other.

2894
02:05:15,580 --> 02:05:20,580
That's the move.
Get yourself an android phone and she's 

2895
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:20,580
listening to this skyping from the other
side of the movie.

2896
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:25,420
I don't do anything wrong.
I wonder if there's like some sort of a 

2897
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:25,420
setting that you can have on you.
You know,

2898
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:27,550
that they have those goggles.
Have you seen these God damn things now,

2899
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:29,950
these never walk.
Never looked through them.

2900
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:31,090
What do we call it again?
Jamie?

2901
02:05:31,091 --> 02:05:31,990
Um,
snapchat,

2902
02:05:32,050 --> 02:05:33,410
snapchat goggles,
right?

2903
02:05:34,030 --> 02:05:36,310
People have these goggles where they can
stream.

2904
02:05:36,550 --> 02:05:41,550
They can stream video from their fucking
eyeglasses like anyway they want 

2905
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:44,920
wherever they are,
they can stream video from eyeglasses to

2906
02:05:44,921 --> 02:05:46,660
pick up where you could,
like,

2907
02:05:46,661 --> 02:05:49,150
I could show you.
I could show what I'm seeing.

2908
02:05:49,390 --> 02:05:51,400
I could look over and see James Show it 
to me.

2909
02:05:51,401 --> 02:05:54,370
How do I see it though?
People could watch it online.

2910
02:05:54,890 --> 02:05:56,830
They can check it out online.
These are these.

2911
02:05:56,860 --> 02:05:58,150
Fuck,
this is crazy.

2912
02:05:58,151 --> 02:05:58,660
I mean,
we're,

2913
02:05:58,661 --> 02:06:03,661
we're experiencing some next level 
technological innovation shit that's 

2914
02:06:04,151 --> 02:06:05,710
happening,
like some new,

2915
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:10,870
like even more invasive internet sort of
thing.

2916
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:14,470
This is the next level.
The next level is you can literally show

2917
02:06:14,471 --> 02:06:15,910
the whole world what you see.

2918
02:06:16,010 --> 02:06:17,650
So is this a,
I mean,

2919
02:06:17,670 --> 02:06:20,960
because I do periscope,
this is highly drunk on the bus

2920
02:06:21,030 --> 02:06:23,850
essentially a lot like that,
but you don't have to hold onto it.

2921
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:26,750
It's on your glasses.
So it's,

2922
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:30,720
it's similar and there's a live 
streaming 32nd clips at a time too,

2923
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:32,100
which that's all the little show.

2924
02:06:32,490 --> 02:06:32,870
Okay.
Yeah.

2925
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:35,700
But do I stay on it?
It's a,

2926
02:06:35,710 --> 02:06:36,490
you know,
it's a blast.

2927
02:06:36,491 --> 02:06:40,000
We have this thing because I got a 
friend that does my vip stuff on the bus

2928
02:06:40,001 --> 02:06:40,960
and he's,
he was,

2929
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:43,540
he was also at that first show that I 
did.

2930
02:06:43,980 --> 02:06:46,930
So for years and Holy Shit.
And uh,

2931
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:51,510
and so his name's Dave and we do the one
where to go down the road.

2932
02:06:51,511 --> 02:06:53,680
We just were like this.
We get just baked,

2933
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:59,340
you know,
after the show we traveled at night and 

2934
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:01,261
we'll do these broadcasts and uh,
the big gay Dave and Ron Show and uh,

2935
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:08,290
which has no content or anything,
but you know what,

2936
02:07:08,291 --> 02:07:13,291
I don't know that it's growing that much
a periscope and it's the most amazing 

2937
02:07:14,291 --> 02:07:16,600
thing that you can do a live broadcast 
and you can pick it up.

2938
02:07:16,601 --> 02:07:21,601
Uh,
Cairo as easy as you can pick it up in 

2939
02:07:21,601 --> 02:07:21,601
Lubbock.

2940
02:07:21,601 --> 02:07:22,430
I think it's pretty popular,
isn't it?

2941
02:07:22,431 --> 02:07:24,930
Pretty popular periscope.
I know Scott Adams.

2942
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:28,430
Scott Adams had a very popular Paris.
Twitter owns it.

2943
02:07:28,450 --> 02:07:29,970
They just made it,
excuse me.

2944
02:07:29,971 --> 02:07:31,950
It's built right in now to twitter's 
apps.

2945
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:34,740
Like if you hit twitter and you're like,
instead of putting up a message,

2946
02:07:34,830 --> 02:07:37,090
there's a button that says live video 
and it's periscope,

2947
02:07:37,091 --> 02:07:42,091
but we'll just open right now trying to 
just figure out how to make it more 

2948
02:07:42,091 --> 02:07:45,930
available for people to be.
And do they have a limitation on how 

2949
02:07:45,930 --> 02:07:45,970
long the clips?
I don't believe.

2950
02:07:45,971 --> 02:07:47,750
So there you can go a little over an 
hour.

2951
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:54,600
Crazy.
That kind of interactivity that has 

2952
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:55,990
never existed before.
There's never,

2953
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:57,260
there's never existed in anything like 
that.

2954
02:07:57,370 --> 02:08:02,370
Scott Adams,
like he was doing coffee with Scott 

2955
02:08:02,370 --> 02:08:03,570
Adams like several times a week,
right?

2956
02:08:03,610 --> 02:08:04,980
Wasn't he?
Yeah.

2957
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:07,180
Yeah.
If,

2958
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:09,380
if we have no idea.
No idea.

2959
02:08:10,780 --> 02:08:12,410
I know he did a bunch of them.
Seven.

2960
02:08:12,550 --> 02:08:13,600
How many,
how many times did you do it?

2961
02:08:13,810 --> 02:08:15,700
I might have just made it doesn't easily
access and turning it on.

2962
02:08:15,701 --> 02:08:20,701
It's on now.
People know it's on now where you are 

2963
02:08:20,701 --> 02:08:20,950
and just turn it on and they get a 
notification.

2964
02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:21,620
Ron,
right.

2965
02:08:21,820 --> 02:08:26,820
They do that on periscope.
You should have one on periscope and 

2966
02:08:26,820 --> 02:08:27,820
says Ron White is.
He wants to talk to 25,000

2967
02:08:28,090 --> 02:08:29,700
followers on periscope.
I traveling.

2968
02:08:30,490 --> 02:08:33,610
I don't know if that's true.
You might get them after the other.

2969
02:08:33,611 --> 02:08:38,611
This podcast podcasts will just tell you
you have them and everybody jumped on 

2970
02:08:38,690 --> 02:08:43,690
follow way.
We don't have a good enough signal for 

2971
02:08:43,690 --> 02:08:47,761
awhile,
but I got bored with the periscope 

2972
02:08:47,761 --> 02:08:47,761
thing.
I'm like,

2973
02:08:47,761 --> 02:08:48,100
Jesus Christ,
don't expose the instagram live.

2974
02:08:48,101 --> 02:08:50,200
Just started up.
I know they've been pushing that around.

2975
02:08:50,201 --> 02:08:54,430
I saw that's a little limited to an hour
and those videos don't last after.

2976
02:08:54,540 --> 02:08:55,150
Oh,
that's weird.

2977
02:08:55,220 --> 02:08:56,410
It just disappear.
Oh,

2978
02:08:56,411 --> 02:08:59,480
that's too bad.
That's too bad about,

2979
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:05,100
but I would guess that the amount of 
fucking data that they would have to 

2980
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:08,870
stock pile.
If everybody's shit saved every every 

2981
02:09:08,870 --> 02:09:12,391
fucking dummy out there,
save the video of them flexing on the 

2982
02:09:12,391 --> 02:09:12,391
beach.

2983
02:09:12,990 --> 02:09:17,950
All the fucking stupid videos of some 
guy telling a shitty joke at a bar.

2984
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:21,280
All those things just gigabyte after 
gigabyte after gigabyte,

2985
02:09:21,281 --> 02:09:24,010
stored on the twitter server.
They'd be like,

2986
02:09:24,011 --> 02:09:29,011
fuck you.
That's what happened to the TMZ bus ride

2987
02:09:29,410 --> 02:09:34,410
that we miss the problem with futures 
that everybody's going to know 

2988
02:09:34,410 --> 02:09:35,560
everything.
Everybody does all the time.

2989
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:40,590
Just kind of not going to be as much 
craziness going on in the next hundred 

2990
02:09:40,590 --> 02:09:42,100
years in the future.
I think everybody's gonna know.

2991
02:09:42,190 --> 02:09:47,190
I think we're about 50 years away from 
us becoming some crazy hive mind.

2992
02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:51,820
That's what I think.
I'm stoned and drunk.

2993
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:54,250
How long do you think I'm making some 
fucking points?

2994
02:09:55,100 --> 02:09:57,910
You've got to just eat what I'm eating 
and get to come to yoga class with me.

2995
02:09:59,410 --> 02:10:01,180
Who live out in the country.

2996
02:10:03,940 --> 02:10:06,220
I'll send somebody to you.
You're a wealthy man.

2997
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:11,470
This is all we have been working with my
yoga girl.

2998
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,900
Uh,
and uh,

2999
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:15,880
it's pretty,
pretty basic stuff,

3000
02:10:15,881 --> 02:10:19,420
but it's a,
but I'm working on it all you need man.

3001
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:24,540
Basic stuff's all you need.
If you could work your way up to do a 

3002
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:24,540
hot yoga class now,
fuck,

3003
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:24,730
you know,
my wife took it.

3004
02:10:24,731 --> 02:10:29,731
Even one of those.
There's a worst thing I've ever done in 

3005
02:10:29,731 --> 02:10:29,860
my life.
I walked out.

3006
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:33,070
That's my stuff first.
How often do you do?

3007
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:38,770
I'd never do it more than twice a week,
but I really should practice some of it 

3008
02:10:38,770 --> 02:10:40,040
at home.
Like I do some shit.

3009
02:10:41,530 --> 02:10:42,170
No,
no,

3010
02:10:42,171 --> 02:10:42,530
no,
no,

3011
02:10:42,531 --> 02:10:43,560
no.
I'm going to do it at home.

3012
02:10:43,570 --> 02:10:46,370
I'm just working on basic exercises,
stretching shit.

3013
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:49,490
But uh,
never more like in class form than twice

3014
02:10:49,491 --> 02:10:50,210
a week.
But when I,

3015
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:55,300
when I have done it twice a week,
I felt better than when I did it once a 

3016
02:10:55,300 --> 02:10:55,300
week.
Yeah.

3017
02:10:55,300 --> 02:10:56,050
But a little bit

3018
02:10:56,500 --> 02:11:00,640
for 25 years.
And in Margo is strong.

3019
02:11:00,850 --> 02:11:03,340
I mean she's strong.
She did had handstands,

3020
02:11:03,750 --> 02:11:07,110
but you know,
she's a big time upper body stronger.

3021
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:08,950
Do you think she could you?
She could.

3022
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:10,640
She kept her back if,
if,

3023
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:15,110
if you look at her in the dark,
kind of from behind.

3024
02:11:15,111 --> 02:11:19,490
If she's flexing her muscles,
she looks kind of like Floyd Mayweather.

3025
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:22,000
I mean just a,
that's not fun.

3026
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:24,590
And she's carrying,
you know,

3027
02:11:25,330 --> 02:11:28,400
thinking like floyd mayweather,
but she's just ripped.

3028
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:30,230
She got to rip the back and she's a 
really,

3029
02:11:30,231 --> 02:11:31,130
really,
really strong.

3030
02:11:31,131 --> 02:11:32,780
But she does.
She's always done that.

3031
02:11:32,781 --> 02:11:33,540
So I'm,
I'm,

3032
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:35,870
I got to do something,
man.

3033
02:11:36,270 --> 02:11:39,670
I can't be fucking going into my 
seventies without being rude,

3034
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:42,890
but it's just to get you on a nutrient 
dense diet.

3035
02:11:43,190 --> 02:11:45,230
Drop a little body fat.
Yeah.

3036
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:49,220
What'd you bring to the fucking party?
A bottle of fucking whiskey joint,

3037
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:50,820
but I wouldn't have that too.
You know,

3038
02:11:50,821 --> 02:11:51,710
I.
How about breakfast?

3039
02:11:51,711 --> 02:11:56,711
I had a Kale shake with mct oil and 
beats raw beets.

3040
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:58,970
Then I went to Yoga.
We have that new,

3041
02:11:58,971 --> 02:12:03,971
a new shoe presser,
new juice presser thing.

3042
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:05,450
It's shit.
Yeah.

3043
02:12:05,890 --> 02:12:07,690
We've just got hooked up with it.
Oh Man.

3044
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:10,340
If you can just get used to drinking 
juice,

3045
02:12:10,341 --> 02:12:15,170
just fresh squeezed vegetable juice,
you can just get used to doing that just

3046
02:12:15,170 --> 02:12:17,510
a few times a day.
It will drastically improve your life.

3047
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:22,840
There's so much nutrients and plants 
that we need and we fucking escape them 

3048
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:24,980
for days.
Potatoes and meat and shit.

3049
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:28,210
I don't have any energy for a workout.
And you know,

3050
02:12:28,211 --> 02:12:29,920
I just don't.
I get there,

3051
02:12:29,921 --> 02:12:31,510
I'm tired.
I don't want to go.

3052
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:34,450
I hate,
I dreaded going in a dreaded.

3053
02:12:34,451 --> 02:12:36,700
When I'd get there I'd read putting on 
my shoes.

3054
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:38,770
I do.
I don't know why.

3055
02:12:38,771 --> 02:12:40,550
Some people are just lazy as I am.
And,

3056
02:12:40,551 --> 02:12:43,720
and I know that's what it is.
And I used to be a runner.

3057
02:12:43,721 --> 02:12:48,721
I used to run five miles a day,
just I would run like crazy and I hurt 

3058
02:12:48,721 --> 02:12:50,320
my knee really bad,
but I just don't like to go to the gym.

3059
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:54,040
I hate it,
but I know I have to.

3060
02:12:54,100 --> 02:12:57,340
I know I have to because my friends are 
all dying and uh,

3061
02:12:57,430 --> 02:13:00,170
and I'm going to be 70 and 10 years and 
uh,

3062
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:05,280
so I've got to.
But I know yoga is the thing because 

3063
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:08,340
this guy that this dave,
Dave is a golfer,

3064
02:13:08,341 --> 02:13:11,080
a buddy of mine,
but he's also yoga for forever.

3065
02:13:11,081 --> 02:13:11,150
Well

3066
02:13:11,190 --> 02:13:12,630
bless you.
Big Gay Dave.

3067
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:14,550
Bless you.
Take him.

3068
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:16,740
Take him where he needs to go.
Yeah,

3069
02:13:16,741 --> 02:13:21,741
man,
Yoga is the best thing about it too is 

3070
02:13:21,741 --> 02:13:22,710
we'll get your heart rate up.
It will be very difficult,

3071
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:25,500
but it's gonna.
Straighten your body out.

3072
02:13:25,501 --> 02:13:28,160
It's going to stretch you out.
Straighten you out.

3073
02:13:28,170 --> 02:13:31,230
It's going to calm you down like you're 
not trying to be a power lifter.

3074
02:13:31,350 --> 02:13:36,350
Know you want to do anything ridiculous.
You want to do anything to hurt your 

3075
02:13:36,350 --> 02:13:36,350
back.
You want to do is something that's going

3076
02:13:36,350 --> 02:13:37,760
to make you feel better.
Well that you know,

3077
02:13:38,670 --> 02:13:40,940
new trainer.
And uh,

3078
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:42,380
and I told the guy,
said,

3079
02:13:42,381 --> 02:13:45,770
listen man,
I'm a pussy.

3080
02:13:45,950 --> 02:13:48,810
You phone's gonna.
Go by what?

3081
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:51,370
You want to talk to him right now,
but please put the play.

3082
02:13:51,371 --> 02:13:54,170
The music fit rings when your phone put 
it up there.

3083
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:08,820
You know,
he's a buddy of mine,

3084
02:14:09,140 --> 02:14:11,050
Brian Johnson,
he,

3085
02:14:11,051 --> 02:14:11,380
um,

3086
02:14:11,490 --> 02:14:16,490
his hearing apparently it's all fucked 
up from all these crazy concerts all 

3087
02:14:16,490 --> 02:14:16,490
those years.

3088
02:14:16,850 --> 02:14:17,440
Well,
they're,

3089
02:14:17,441 --> 02:14:17,980
uh,
you know,

3090
02:14:17,981 --> 02:14:20,800
it's kind of an interesting thing that 
a,

3091
02:14:20,870 --> 02:14:24,500
because we're talking about the holiday 
evolution of anything,

3092
02:14:24,530 --> 02:14:25,480
you know,
and uh,

3093
02:14:26,120 --> 02:14:31,120
but there was a guy in Australia who 
invented the ear in ear monitors which 

3094
02:14:32,330 --> 02:14:37,330
destroyed his hearing to begin with.
So he dedicated his life to find a way 

3095
02:14:37,851 --> 02:14:40,280
to fix that.
And so he did.

3096
02:14:40,700 --> 02:14:42,560
But the problem is,
and he does,

3097
02:14:42,561 --> 02:14:47,561
I mean,
if you've watched the tape of people 

3098
02:14:47,561 --> 02:14:47,600
putting these things on people that are 
almost completely deaf,

3099
02:14:47,601 --> 02:14:51,380
putting this system in their ears,
everyone starts crying.

3100
02:14:51,620 --> 02:14:52,700
Wow.
Every one of them.

3101
02:14:53,210 --> 02:14:54,310
And uh,
so he,

3102
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:56,390
he had an open letter to Brian Johnson 
said,

3103
02:14:56,391 --> 02:15:01,391
Brian,
I want to come to your house in 

3104
02:15:01,391 --> 02:15:01,391
Sarasota.
I want you to put these in your ears.

3105
02:15:01,391 --> 02:15:03,840
But the problem is it's not portable.
That is not it.

3106
02:15:03,841 --> 02:15:08,841
It's portable in that it's this big,
like a laptop size.

3107
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:12,020
It says it's bigger than that.
Like a large.

3108
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:12,870
Yeah.
Right.

3109
02:15:13,910 --> 02:15:15,200
And uh,
so,

3110
02:15:16,850 --> 02:15:17,180
but,
uh,

3111
02:15:17,260 --> 02:15:19,040
but the technology's there,
I mean he can,

3112
02:15:19,060 --> 02:15:21,990
he's amazing and he hates hearing aids 
and uh,

3113
02:15:22,150 --> 02:15:24,870
you know,
and he's a surgeon,

3114
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:28,340
he's the sweetest guy.
He was a wonderful,

3115
02:15:28,341 --> 02:15:29,420
wonderful human being.

3116
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:31,020
But you know,
what was cool about it,

3117
02:15:31,021 --> 02:15:33,750
man,
when Axel rose started,

3118
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:36,060
I was like,
should I accept this?

3119
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:41,360
No.
Should you accept axl rose saying and 

3120
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:43,380
ACDC,
NIH excepted it 100 percent because I 

3121
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:46,611
thought it might not be Brian Johnson,
but it's still why that's so fucking 

3122
02:15:46,611 --> 02:15:47,190
rose.
Right?

3123
02:15:47,330 --> 02:15:51,290
And it's kind of interesting.
Like Brian couldn't do it anymore.

3124
02:15:51,291 --> 02:15:53,340
Actually steps in.
I like it,

3125
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:55,740
I like it.
I'm happy with that.

3126
02:15:56,190 --> 02:15:58,010
That's a freak show,
but in,

3127
02:15:58,011 --> 02:16:03,011
in an awesome way.
It's like how often you're going to see 

3128
02:16:03,011 --> 02:16:05,421
this.
How often do you get to see axl rose 

3129
02:16:05,421 --> 02:16:05,700
seeing it as a lead singer for AC 
fucking DC?

3130
02:16:05,710 --> 02:16:08,270
Like wow,
whether they're digging shit,

3131
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:10,350
their ticket sales dropped by 70 
percent.

3132
02:16:10,380 --> 02:16:15,380
That's a bunch of puppies in America.
Well that's true.

3133
02:16:17,540 --> 02:16:19,950
They know.
But the thing is,

3134
02:16:19,951 --> 02:16:24,330
that's Brian Johnson's voice.
Brian Johnson is back in black,

3135
02:16:24,331 --> 02:16:25,950
was the second biggest selling album

3136
02:16:26,070 --> 02:16:30,940
of all time behind thriller and 52 
million copies as Brian Johnson,

3137
02:16:30,941 --> 02:16:35,290
not fucking axl rose Johnson is still a 
freak show vocalist.

3138
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:36,910
And,
and at some point,

3139
02:16:36,911 --> 02:16:37,660
you know,
his brother,

3140
02:16:37,661 --> 02:16:41,110
Malcolm Malcolm was the better guitar 
player anyway,

3141
02:16:41,470 --> 02:16:44,260
better than angus and angus knew at 
everybody.

3142
02:16:44,261 --> 02:16:45,940
Fucking yeah.
But,

3143
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:48,490
but he was the engine behind that really
complicated.

3144
02:16:48,510 --> 02:16:52,330
It doesn't sound complicated.
Really fucking complicated rock and roll

3145
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:57,720
and uh,
that's why it was so engaging for the 

3146
02:16:57,720 --> 02:16:57,720
whole fucking planet.
And it was.

3147
02:16:57,720 --> 02:16:59,850
But it was Brian Johnson's voice,
not been,

3148
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:01,780
not bond Scott's,
you know,

3149
02:17:01,781 --> 02:17:03,910
that he was their lead singer for five 
years.

3150
02:17:03,970 --> 02:17:06,460
But Scott has some great fucking songs 
to write.

3151
02:17:06,550 --> 02:17:08,170
He did,
he said he did.

3152
02:17:08,171 --> 02:17:10,260
But with Scott,
I,

3153
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:11,070
yeah,
I don't know.

3154
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:12,690
God Damn it because I've,
I've,

3155
02:17:12,691 --> 02:17:13,810
I've only,
I've only,

3156
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:18,190
I've only heard Brian St but,
but back in black is,

3157
02:17:18,191 --> 02:17:23,191
which was the second biggest selling 
album of all time was all Brian Johnson 

3158
02:17:23,191 --> 02:17:24,740
and no doubt about it.
I'm not saying he wasn't,

3159
02:17:24,870 --> 02:17:26,430
so you know what?
And,

3160
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:30,730
and I'm wrong as I usually am because 
why not?

3161
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:33,600
And anger still loves to play it.
And you know,

3162
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:34,120
when,
uh,

3163
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:39,840
it got ugly,
well that's not my place to talk about 

3164
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:39,840
that.
But uh,

3165
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,630
but there was some political shit,
you know,

3166
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:42,520
but.
Well,

3167
02:17:42,521 --> 02:17:43,600
whatever.
But yeah.

3168
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:47,280
And I also heard some reviews that he 
did a really good.

3169
02:17:47,281 --> 02:17:47,320
Yeah,

3170
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:52,360
job are these who sings these Jamie?
Which one's dirty deeds?

3171
02:17:53,030 --> 02:17:54,560
Highway to hell.
Oh my God.

3172
02:17:54,561 --> 02:17:55,460
Highway to hell.

3173
02:17:56,510 --> 02:17:59,390
Oh my God.
Go back up to 30 days.

3174
02:17:59,391 --> 02:18:02,420
That's Brian Johnson right?
There it is.

3175
02:18:02,421 --> 02:18:04,310
If you want to,
if you want to hear somebody sing it.

3176
02:18:04,510 --> 02:18:05,720
Well,
he was fucking amazing.

3177
02:18:05,721 --> 02:18:06,860
Look,
they were both amazing.

3178
02:18:06,890 --> 02:18:09,290
No,
I'm not like a picking sides.

3179
02:18:09,620 --> 02:18:12,500
But what if Brian Johnson just came out 
to the shows.

3180
02:18:12,590 --> 02:18:13,460
I mean,
he can't,

3181
02:18:13,970 --> 02:18:17,300
he can't do it and I wouldn't do that 
because just because it would be cool to

3182
02:18:17,301 --> 02:18:18,630
see them.
They're like,

3183
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:23,090
oh man.
Wheeling them out.

3184
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:23,840
He just can't.

3185
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:28,280
Yeah,
well he's still racing cars.

3186
02:18:28,720 --> 02:18:33,720
I mean he's,
he's got a fucking car team that he 

3187
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:36,741
races these low.
There's these big old guys that were in 

3188
02:18:36,741 --> 02:18:40,371
Pan Am races.
These cars were running 200 miles an 

3189
02:18:40,371 --> 02:18:40,371
hour.
He racism.

3190
02:18:40,371 --> 02:18:41,760
Oh Wow.
And he travels the country.

3191
02:18:41,761 --> 02:18:44,250
He's got a new car show coming out that 
I'm going to be part of.

3192
02:18:44,590 --> 02:18:48,310
No Shit.
He insisted on my part.

3193
02:18:48,350 --> 02:18:49,970
I a couple of days for the whole season

3194
02:18:50,150 --> 02:18:55,150
can.
But can they in any way restore his 

3195
02:18:55,150 --> 02:18:55,150
hearing to the point where he could 
start saying yes,

3196
02:18:56,250 --> 02:18:58,340
andy would tell.
I felt like,

3197
02:18:58,460 --> 02:18:59,330
you know,
when,

3198
02:18:59,390 --> 02:19:01,700
when he stepped out,
I was like,

3199
02:19:01,730 --> 02:19:06,110
this is a weird moment in our,
a love of these,

3200
02:19:06,350 --> 02:19:09,200
these epic rockstars when we see,
you know,

3201
02:19:10,660 --> 02:19:14,330
well,
I went to see Chicago the other day with

3202
02:19:14,331 --> 02:19:16,180
my son and uh,
it,

3203
02:19:16,210 --> 02:19:17,880
it was great.
It was fucking great there.

3204
02:19:17,881 --> 02:19:19,530
There's three guys,
uh,

3205
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:21,770
and not one of,
one of the singers,

3206
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:27,160
the one that wasn't as good and uh,
and he was replaced by Irish tenor that 

3207
02:19:28,701 --> 02:19:30,800
could just hit every single one of those
notes.

3208
02:19:30,801 --> 02:19:32,600
And it was great.
And that was with my son.

3209
02:19:32,601 --> 02:19:34,150
We were partying.
So I,

3210
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:39,220
the only reason is it's kind of personal
to me because he's a friend and so I 

3211
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:40,280
know what he was going through that year
and uh,

3212
02:19:40,300 --> 02:19:45,300
and with also the death of his best 
friend and then his loss of his hearing 

3213
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:49,550
and then the laws of his band and,
and there were only a few dates left,

3214
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:55,240
but that's the other way when to go out.
But he's brand fucking Johnson know 

3215
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:55,240
shit.
He's the,

3216
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:58,610
he was literally a treasure of a fucking
guy.

3217
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:00,170
He's right up there with Charlie 
Chapman,

3218
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:03,600
Charlie Chapman,
Brian Johnson.

3219
02:20:04,310 --> 02:20:05,360
Yeah.
I mean,

3220
02:20:05,420 --> 02:20:08,420
there's no doubt about it man.
I mean he's a fucking epic vocalists.

3221
02:20:08,570 --> 02:20:09,590
Epic,
you know,

3222
02:20:09,890 --> 02:20:14,890
fucking impact.
And his intensity got me through many a 

3223
02:20:14,890 --> 02:20:15,380
workout when I was struggling.
Adolescent.

3224
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:16,610
It's still on my phone.

3225
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:21,050
That is one of the,
like the all time.

3226
02:20:21,051 --> 02:20:25,340
You can actually a kitten bands ever.
You could pull up of footage.

3227
02:20:25,341 --> 02:20:30,341
I guess you can have a Margo and Brian 
onstage and Jacksonville,

3228
02:20:31,131 --> 02:20:34,890
Florida and a gun club yet.
But uh,

3229
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,730
Brian Johnson and Margo Ray.
See if that comes up.

3230
02:20:37,790 --> 02:20:39,460
That's awesome.
Oh,

3231
02:20:39,470 --> 02:20:42,480
good Lord.
It was margo show and towards the end of

3232
02:20:42,481 --> 02:20:45,470
it Brian was there and I was like,
you know,

3233
02:20:45,471 --> 02:20:48,230
or uh,
her band knows,

3234
02:20:48,231 --> 02:20:50,720
shook me all night long.
They'd been working on it all we do.

3235
02:20:50,721 --> 02:20:52,310
You want to go sing it?
He goes,

3236
02:20:52,311 --> 02:20:53,980
where did,
I don't know if I could show you.

3237
02:20:56,240 --> 02:21:00,130
I would foster that.
And uh,

3238
02:21:00,950 --> 02:21:02,000
oh,
there it is right there.

3239
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:04,610
That's my wife Margaret.
This is crazy.

3240
02:21:27,610 --> 02:21:29,830
This is so crazy.
When was this?

3241
02:21:31,050 --> 02:21:32,380
Twenty four,
three or four years?

3242
02:21:32,790 --> 02:21:34,550
Was it two or three years ago?
So video.

3243
02:21:35,260 --> 02:21:35,890
Wow.

3244
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:45,620
She has a friend of mine is going to 
come up.

3245

Azalea Song Shit from a AC DC.
Brian Johnson.

3246
02:21:53,300 --> 02:21:55,700
And how many people are in this runner?
Seventy five.

3247
02:21:56,420 --> 02:21:58,940
Same.
Oh my God.

3248
02:21:58,941 --> 02:22:03,470
That must have been the most epic shit 
ever to be in that room.

3249
02:22:04,850 --> 02:22:09,850
God Damn Man.
I saw Gary Clark Jr and honey.

3250
02:22:10,521 --> 02:22:15,521
Honey play in front of like 300 people.
Do you know Gary Clark Jr?

3251
02:22:16,430 --> 02:22:17,870
He was in an episode.
Roadies.

3252
02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:22,000
God Damn,
that dude's shit.

3253
02:22:22,070 --> 02:22:23,120
Him and honey.
Honey,

downtown

3255
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:26,490
La.

3256
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,830
Dang.
You've been waiting for your Hendrix,

3257
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:33,470
Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Where's that guy coming from?

3258
02:22:33,471 --> 02:22:34,850
That's who it is.
Clark

3259
02:22:35,320 --> 02:22:36,620
to.
That guy's.

3260
02:22:36,650 --> 02:22:41,650
He's,
he's got something crazy going on the 

3261
02:22:41,650 --> 02:22:45,541
way he,
he has got such a specific guitar sound 

3262
02:22:45,541 --> 02:22:47,880
like he did this riff and while he was 
doing this,

3263
02:22:47,970 --> 02:22:48,590
this,
this,

3264
02:22:48,730 --> 02:22:49,540
they,
um,

3265
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:53,650
they play.
They did a cover of the midnight rider.

3266
02:22:53,740 --> 02:22:57,400
They decided on the spot.
So Suzanne from honey,

3267
02:22:57,401 --> 02:22:59,160
honey didn't even know the words to 
songs.

3268
02:22:59,170 --> 02:23:02,290
So she got on her phone and downloaded 
the words.

3269
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:07,320
So she had the words on her phone.
She's reading off the phone and people 

3270
02:23:07,320 --> 02:23:08,410
got mad because always bitch keeps 
checking her phone while she's singing.

3271
02:23:08,650 --> 02:23:13,650
She's literally joked around about it.
She doesn't know the words to the song 

3272
02:23:13,650 --> 02:23:15,250
because although she's a fan,
she hasn't Sung in years.

3273
02:23:15,251 --> 02:23:17,170
She doesn't know which probably never 
sang it live.

3274
02:23:17,320 --> 02:23:21,430
So she live for the first time ever 
improvising on the spot.

3275
02:23:21,490 --> 02:23:24,580
Sings her version unprepared of midnight
rider.

3276
02:23:24,670 --> 02:23:29,670
Why Gary motherfucking Clark junior 
plays all the dickey betts part.

3277
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:31,570
Look at this shit.
Listen to this.

3278
02:23:34,260 --> 02:23:39,260
I'm recording this in the front row.
Get fucked up.

3279
02:23:51,141 --> 02:23:56,141
And listening to music is an alien can 
feel comfortable in saying that's the 

3280
02:24:15,561 --> 02:24:18,170
most intriguing guitarists since 
hendricks.

3281
02:24:18,820 --> 02:24:20,600
I feel real comfortable saying that

3282
02:24:24,700 --> 02:24:27,560
that's,
that's a bad motherfucker.

3283
02:24:27,710 --> 02:24:31,850
And they see that live in like a couple 
of maybe 300 people at the most

3284
02:24:32,670 --> 02:24:33,420
blade.
Uh,

3285
02:24:33,430 --> 02:24:36,060
you know,
he came out whenever my character died,

3286
02:24:36,061 --> 02:24:38,970
he was one of the guys that came to the 
funeral and saying.

3287
02:24:38,971 --> 02:24:42,240
And the character of roadies,
nobody watched it.

3288
02:24:42,241 --> 02:24:43,940
So.
But he was anyway

3289
02:24:44,210 --> 02:24:46,280
psyched about that man.
Before it came out.

3290
02:24:46,330 --> 02:24:48,250
I was,
I was.

3291
02:24:48,251 --> 02:24:49,390
And it was,
you know what it was,

3292
02:24:49,420 --> 02:24:50,400
it was good.
It was,

3293
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:51,850
it was really good.
I thought it was.

3294
02:24:51,910 --> 02:24:54,040
I thought it was wonderful.
And it was,

3295
02:24:54,130 --> 02:24:55,990
the problem was,
it was,

3296
02:24:56,240 --> 02:25:01,240
you know,
a lot of people have a fucking hard on 

3297
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:01,630
for Cameron Crowe for some reason.
Really.

3298
02:25:02,380 --> 02:25:02,520
Like,

3299
02:25:04,220 --> 02:25:07,480
you know,
they jumped on this shows back so hard,

3300
02:25:07,481 --> 02:25:08,860
so fast.
I mean,

3301
02:25:08,861 --> 02:25:13,861
the critics did relationship with the 
first word out of their mouths was just 

3302
02:25:14,501 --> 02:25:15,250
this,
fuck it,

3303
02:25:15,251 --> 02:25:16,930
it's the worst piece of shit.
I'm like,

3304
02:25:17,870 --> 02:25:20,290
what the one.
I love it.

3305
02:25:20,650 --> 02:25:21,790
I think it's a,
you know,

3306
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:24,250
it was,
cameron always has sweetness to it shows

3307
02:25:24,690 --> 02:25:29,690
every.
His movies always have a sweet edge to 

3308
02:25:29,690 --> 02:25:29,690
them,
you know,

3309
02:25:29,690 --> 02:25:33,450
no matter what it is,
whether it's a fast times at Ridgemont 

3310
02:25:33,450 --> 02:25:36,100
high or the whole lot of movies,
Jerry Mcguire,

3311
02:25:37,830 --> 02:25:40,000
uh,
almost famous,

3312
02:25:40,450 --> 02:25:42,630
you know,
they all had all

3313
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:45,450
too fast times at Ridgemont high and 
almost famous.

3314
02:25:45,690 --> 02:25:47,130
Those are epic movies,

3315
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:47,770
right?
Yeah.

3316
02:25:47,830 --> 02:25:48,790
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

3317
02:25:49,070 --> 02:25:51,220
In general.
Dryer one best.

3318
02:25:51,710 --> 02:25:54,220
Somebody wants something for something 
in Jerry Maguire.

3319
02:25:54,880 --> 02:25:59,800
Show me the money.
It could be a junior.

3320
02:25:59,801 --> 02:26:00,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

3321
02:26:00,850 --> 02:26:03,490
And uh,
so anyway,

3322
02:26:03,491 --> 02:26:05,860
the uh,
I forget we're talking about Tom Cruise.

3323
02:26:05,890 --> 02:26:06,840
Tom Cruise?
No,

3324
02:26:07,510 --> 02:26:09,250
no.
Oh yeah.

3325
02:26:09,251 --> 02:26:12,190
The movie,
they just jumped on it.

3326
02:26:12,370 --> 02:26:13,850
They just jumped on it.
They were shooting,

3327
02:26:13,851 --> 02:26:17,860
you know,
the course because they could and uh,

3328
02:26:17,910 --> 02:26:20,630
and their cousins and whoever that 
branch is,

3329
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:25,640
it reviews for variety magazine.
One day she's going to feel a Turd in 

3330
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:30,431
her throat who's turned wellbeing?
And we might turn shit right.

3331
02:26:31,550 --> 02:26:35,590
Shit in her mouth and shit.
These are strong words.

3332
02:26:35,650 --> 02:26:36,880
Oh,
they're horrible words.

3333
02:26:38,380 --> 02:26:39,040
Yeah.
Okay.

3334
02:26:39,041 --> 02:26:40,680
Maybe I'll just flick some economies.

3335
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:45,720
Dress.
I think it's going to be way easier if 

3336
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:45,720
you,
uh,

3337
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:47,330
I,
I think about like the,

3338
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:52,540
like the kind of sort of grudges that 
someone can have with someone like him,

3339
02:26:52,541 --> 02:26:57,541
like Cameron Crowe.
It's going to be way easier to avoid 

3340
02:26:57,541 --> 02:26:59,350
that stuff if you're being reviewed by 
everybody instead of just being reviewed

3341
02:26:59,351 --> 02:27:04,351
by a bunch of,
like selected outlets like the 

3342
02:27:04,351 --> 02:27:04,351
Washington Post,
the New York Times,

3343
02:27:04,351 --> 02:27:04,840
the Hollywood reporter,
Blah Blah,

3344
02:27:04,841 --> 02:27:05,110
blah,
blah,

3345
02:27:05,130 --> 02:27:10,130
blah.
Just the open ended aspect of the 

3346
02:27:10,130 --> 02:27:10,130
Internet is kind of changing that,
don't you think?

3347
02:27:10,580 --> 02:27:11,610
I think so.
No,

3348
02:27:12,090 --> 02:27:14,060
I think so.
Uh,

3349
02:27:14,061 --> 02:27:14,590
they,
you know,

3350
02:27:14,650 --> 02:27:17,620
they canceled it.
My character was going to die anyway and

3351
02:27:17,621 --> 02:27:18,740
uh,
the.

3352
02:27:18,800 --> 02:27:20,060
So I was like,
Eh,

3353
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:22,260
but I still love the cast so much.
It was a,

3354
02:27:22,610 --> 02:27:24,350
you know,
fucking machine gun.

3355
02:27:24,380 --> 02:27:27,560
Kelly's got a fucking huge hit on the 
radio or just,

3356
02:27:27,561 --> 02:27:32,561
I just did.
That kid is cool as fuck machine gun 

3357
02:27:32,561 --> 02:27:36,371
Kelly,
do you know who they don't know that 

3358
02:27:36,371 --> 02:27:36,371
guy?
Oh,

3359
02:27:36,371 --> 02:27:36,371
he's a,
he's a young.

3360
02:27:36,371 --> 02:27:37,880
Jamie just nodded at me like I'm an old 
man.

3361
02:27:37,890 --> 02:27:39,300
Yeah,
you're young,

3362
02:27:39,330 --> 02:27:43,020
old fucking unbelievable rapper white 
guy.

3363
02:27:43,021 --> 02:27:48,021
I've added is Cleveland.
That's what the world needs more white 

3364
02:27:48,021 --> 02:27:48,021
rapper.
Fucking crazy.

3365
02:27:48,021 --> 02:27:48,070
The age of trump.
No,

3366
02:27:48,080 --> 02:27:53,080
they don't need more,
but they need this one because he's the 

3367
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:55,120
real fucking deal.
And he's a uh,

3368
02:27:55,160 --> 02:27:56,770
he was great in the show.
Just great.

3369
02:27:56,780 --> 02:28:01,780
He was a.
He really gave the honesty to the 

3370
02:28:01,780 --> 02:28:03,170
fucking show because he,
because he is a big party in Rockstar.

3371
02:28:03,950 --> 02:28:07,910
I'm writing his name down by UK.
Yeah.

3372
02:28:08,940 --> 02:28:10,190
Nice.
It's,

3373
02:28:10,350 --> 02:28:15,350
well,
it's always cool to see and hear about 

3374
02:28:15,350 --> 02:28:15,350
new shit.
That's awesome.

3375
02:28:15,350 --> 02:28:17,250
I heard there's a documentary on Netflix
called rat.

3376
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:19,380
I'm scared.
Have you seen a chemi?

3377
02:28:19,510 --> 02:28:20,530
Nope.
I think I told you about it.

3378
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:24,200
Heard about smart rats and rats in New 
York.

3379
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:29,230
Jesus Christ.
Morgan spurlock while you trying to 

3380
02:28:29,230 --> 02:28:29,230
fucking freak me out again.
I saw it.

3381
02:28:29,230 --> 02:28:30,140
I saw it on there and that chose not to 
watch.

3382
02:28:30,141 --> 02:28:33,720
It freaked me out about Mcdonald's.
Now he's freaking me out about rats.

3383
02:28:33,721 --> 02:28:35,240
That God,
Dan Morgan,

3384
02:28:35,241 --> 02:28:38,570
spurlock,
rats.

3385
02:28:38,571 --> 02:28:42,800
Apparently in New York City there's as 
many rats as there are human beings.

3386
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:44,240
I made that up.

3387
02:28:46,920 --> 02:28:49,340
That was with you in the days before the
Internet.

3388
02:28:49,370 --> 02:28:54,370
I could get away with it.
I think it's probably pretty close 

3389
02:28:54,370 --> 02:28:54,370
though.
Honestly.

3390
02:28:54,370 --> 02:28:56,980
They might actually be more rapture 
because look how much space they take 

3391
02:28:56,980 --> 02:28:56,980
up.
Whoa.

3392
02:28:56,980 --> 02:29:01,091
Look at this.
The Morgan spurlock flying over the big 

3393
02:29:01,091 --> 02:29:04,901
rat right there.
The space of a Jack Daniels whiskey 

3394
02:29:04,901 --> 02:29:04,901
bottle.
Yeah.

3395
02:29:04,901 --> 02:29:07,640
It was about the size of a good look at 
the floor on this thing.

3396
02:29:08,390 --> 02:29:09,150
Wonderful.
As viewed.

3397
02:29:09,220 --> 02:29:09,980
Wonderful.
The floor.

3398
02:29:10,070 --> 02:29:12,140
It's a beautiful bottle.
Be Awesome for a bar.

3399
02:29:12,141 --> 02:29:14,270
Fight.
Some shit broke out.

3400
02:29:14,310 --> 02:29:15,990
We have to do.
Are we had ice?

3401
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:17,600
Do you care how it dropped back?
Yeah.

3402
02:29:17,690 --> 02:29:22,690
I'm not about taking the I gotta.
I'm going to have my car towed and 

3403
02:29:22,690 --> 02:29:23,900
that's what I'm saying.
Fucking car towed.

3404
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:28,050
Don't worry about the ice.
There is plenty of missed.

3405
02:29:28,410 --> 02:29:30,530
Why?
Where are you?

3406
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:34,730
People like text messaging and my wife 
and tell him you're on youtube.

3407
02:29:36,070 --> 02:29:40,760
Out in Al Gore's into webs.
Floating through space and look,

3408
02:29:40,761 --> 02:29:41,960
it's young.
Jamie with the ice.

3409
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:47,440
Bam.
Young James Cameron or opera camera 

3410
02:29:47,991 --> 02:29:49,520
operator.
Ice Catheter.

3411
02:29:50,180 --> 02:29:51,890
Bad motherfucker.
Ron White.

3412
02:29:51,891 --> 02:29:52,840
What are you doing?
Text messaging.

3413
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:53,780
Traveling.
No,

3414
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:57,110
I'm just trying.
My wife is trying to find me.

3415
02:29:57,530 --> 02:29:59,480
I told you this was gonna be about an 
hour,

3416
02:29:59,481 --> 02:30:02,090
so I told her get her a drone bro.
Like a little one.

3417
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:04,000
Just keep it right next to you.
Right.

3418
02:30:04,010 --> 02:30:05,580
Have a good on red.
Okay.

3419
02:30:06,090 --> 02:30:09,050
Also,
it's like my fucking balls.

3420
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:12,680
You have like an artificial children's 
flying over your head like that.

3421
02:30:12,830 --> 02:30:17,830
It gets a.
At least it gives you like this mental 

3422
02:30:17,830 --> 02:30:17,830
discipline.
You have to ignore the drone.

3423
02:30:17,830 --> 02:30:18,770
Ignore the drone.
Ignore the drawn them.

3424
02:30:19,700 --> 02:30:20,330
I get it.
Okay.

3425
02:30:20,730 --> 02:30:23,450
I'm going to bring her onto.
Don't do it.

3426
02:30:24,660 --> 02:30:27,200
If we could wrap this up if you want.
No,

3427
02:30:27,201 --> 02:30:28,250
no.
I don't want to wrap it up.

3428
02:30:28,251 --> 02:30:29,460
But um.
Oh,

3429
02:30:29,480 --> 02:30:32,750
she thought it was gonna be an hour.
We've definitely done our podcasts.

3430
02:30:32,900 --> 02:30:35,120
Only a couple.
Like maybe three.

3431
02:30:35,670 --> 02:30:37,640
I don't care.
I'm having a blast.

3432
02:30:37,710 --> 02:30:41,280
Okay.
I want to stay here and drink wild.

3433
02:30:41,390 --> 02:30:43,520
Nobody wants to.
Nobody cares anymore.

3434
02:30:43,521 --> 02:30:46,200
That's not gonna happen.
That place isn't going to exist.

3435
02:30:49,940 --> 02:30:53,330
I'm still at work.
Ron Wyden is at work.

3436
02:30:53,331 --> 02:30:56,210
Ladies and gentlemen.
These cameras aren't on.

3437
02:30:56,211 --> 02:30:58,790
There were definitely not.
Why would that be?

3438
02:30:59,210 --> 02:30:59,790
Are they?
Yeah.

3439
02:30:59,900 --> 02:31:00,950
For sure.
Oh good.

3440
02:31:01,370 --> 02:31:03,410
We're streaming.
We stream on youtube.

3441
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:05,750
Okay.
And the record.

3442
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:08,120
And then it gets uploaded after the 
fact.

3443
02:31:08,121 --> 02:31:11,990
We put it on the itunes.
So are we live to anybody right now?

3444
02:31:12,260 --> 02:31:14,210
Probably like,
let me guess.

3445
02:31:14,480 --> 02:31:15,410
10,000
people.

3446
02:31:15,710 --> 02:31:16,670
Oh,
I guessed.

3447
02:31:16,780 --> 02:31:18,530
Really?
Wow.

3448
02:31:18,590 --> 02:31:20,760
That's a fucking good cast.
Holy Shit.

3449
02:31:20,850 --> 02:31:23,930
He says I wouldn't even have had gas.
I never,

3450
02:31:23,931 --> 02:31:25,200
uh,
I've never asked before,

3451
02:31:25,230 --> 02:31:27,900
like only in the big ones,
like when we do fight companions,

3452
02:31:27,930 --> 02:31:30,090
what's the most it's ever been like 30 
or something?

3453
02:31:31,230 --> 02:31:33,740
Thirty 3000,
33,000

3454
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:39,040
at the most.
I can get stirred up on the periscopes 

3455
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:39,990
about $3,200
maybe.

3456
02:31:40,470 --> 02:31:41,650
I don't know what I got.
Um,

3457
02:31:41,800 --> 02:31:43,170
I don't,
I haven't used it in so long,

3458
02:31:43,171 --> 02:31:48,171
but it's,
it's one of those things where if 

3459
02:31:48,171 --> 02:31:50,571
someone found out,
like that's one of the things that 

3460
02:31:50,571 --> 02:31:50,571
happened with that,
uh,

3461
02:31:51,510 --> 02:31:53,560
the um,
uh,

3462
02:31:53,730 --> 02:31:56,340
Scott Adams guy because people found out
they were like,

3463
02:31:56,341 --> 02:31:58,110
wow,
this really intelligent guy.

3464
02:31:58,470 --> 02:32:00,310
He's also a trump supporter.
Is he trump supporter?

3465
02:32:00,311 --> 02:32:01,230
No,
he's not a trump supporter.

3466
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:04,650
He's literally not even voting,
but he's breaking down.

3467
02:32:04,651 --> 02:32:06,870
Why thinks trump's going to win?
And people are freaking the fuck out.

3468
02:32:06,871 --> 02:32:07,920
Like he literally,
he's telling you,

3469
02:32:07,921 --> 02:32:12,921
I'm not voting,
I'm not voting for anybody because then 

3470
02:32:12,921 --> 02:32:13,710
I'll have some sort of a player in the 
game.

3471
02:32:13,711 --> 02:32:17,190
He knew he is a weird guy,
that Scott Adams in a good way,

3472
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:19,550
like he's sort of defined.
He's,

3473
02:32:19,590 --> 02:32:24,240
he defies a lot of sort of a democrat 
democratic.

3474
02:32:25,170 --> 02:32:27,000
He will.
He's very open minded,

3475
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:32,060
I would say.
But he got unfairly labeled as being 

3476
02:32:32,060 --> 02:32:34,200
like this a trump supporter.
Whereas I don't think he was a trump.

3477
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:36,920
I don't think it was.
Most certainly was not anti trump.

3478
02:32:37,020 --> 02:32:39,210
Well,
what he was trying to send to hurt

3479
02:32:40,690 --> 02:32:45,650
trump's a program for him to say,
trump's gonna win for sure.

3480
02:32:45,651 --> 02:32:50,651
And I'm the one that knows.
And he also has the background and he's 

3481
02:32:50,651 --> 02:32:51,500
the one that knows.
So it wasn't,

3482
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:51,950
it,
it,

3483
02:32:52,010 --> 02:32:55,820
you know,
it was one of the several blows that,

3484
02:32:55,821 --> 02:33:00,821
uh,
that Hillary took besides being a 

3485
02:33:00,821 --> 02:33:03,350
horrible candidate that she took that 
knocked it out of her hands.

3486
02:33:03,351 --> 02:33:08,351
You know,
there were these two people are running 

3487
02:33:08,351 --> 02:33:08,351
against the only people that they could 
possibly fucking be.

3488
02:33:08,351 --> 02:33:10,190
And uh,
you know,

3489
02:33:10,230 --> 02:33:14,960
if she just wouldn't have said basket of
deplorables when she said that,

3490
02:33:14,961 --> 02:33:18,860
I was like,
Jesus fucking Christ,

3491
02:33:19,660 --> 02:33:21,640
bunch of them,
give them a hammer.

3492
02:33:21,970 --> 02:33:24,010
But anyway,
just,

3493
02:33:24,130 --> 02:33:25,210
you know,
when people,

3494
02:33:25,211 --> 02:33:28,000
even people that wanted to look at it as
an alternative vote,

3495
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:33,980
like,
is it an alternative to the potential 

3496
02:33:33,980 --> 02:33:34,450
chaos that trump could cause,
you know,

3497
02:33:34,451 --> 02:33:37,360
and some people looked at it that way 
and some people honestly,

3498
02:33:37,361 --> 02:33:38,200
I think,
um,

3499
02:33:38,230 --> 02:33:43,230
I don't know what percentage I would 
guess it would be because there's a 

3500
02:33:43,230 --> 02:33:45,160
bunch of pragmatists that got in there 
and when it came time to vote,

3501
02:33:45,161 --> 02:33:47,290
looked at that fucking ballot and said,
do you know what,

3502
02:33:49,150 --> 02:33:54,150
let's just see what happens.
Let's just see what happens if we put 

3503
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:54,150
this fucking crazy guy in here.

3504
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:55,290
We were in England,
why not?

3505
02:33:55,291 --> 02:33:56,080
And uh,
it,

3506
02:33:56,090 --> 02:34:01,090
it went to Margaret,
his friend's house and this guy who I 

3507
02:34:01,090 --> 02:34:01,090
really,
really like a,

3508
02:34:02,070 --> 02:34:03,900
he goes,
well,

3509
02:34:04,710 --> 02:34:06,870
the monkey in me would love to see 
trump.

3510
02:34:09,230 --> 02:34:11,670
Yeah,
the monkey in me,

3511
02:34:12,040 --> 02:34:14,260
if get and areas,
you know,

3512
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:15,740
what could he really do and,

3513
02:34:16,690 --> 02:34:18,070
but I

3514
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:19,570
don't know.
He could definitely do something,

3515
02:34:19,571 --> 02:34:20,650
but what would he do?
Good.

3516
02:34:21,100 --> 02:34:21,450
What,
what,

3517
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:21,800
what

3518
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:24,060
complete shakeup of the system look 
like?

3519
02:34:24,061 --> 02:34:25,260
I don't know,
you know,

3520
02:34:25,261 --> 02:34:30,261
and I think that this is weird defining 
of things right now where everyone has 

3521
02:34:30,261 --> 02:34:33,300
to absolutely say in one way or another,
either support or deny,

3522
02:34:33,630 --> 02:34:37,830
either support him but don't sweat it 
gets to me to be real cultish.

3523
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:39,380
It gets to me to be real

3524
02:34:39,410 --> 02:34:42,520
liked fucking Patriot pride,
you know,

3525
02:34:42,521 --> 02:34:43,670
Yo,
I'm fucking,

3526
02:34:43,690 --> 02:34:47,830
I'm for the dolphins no matter what.
It gets real weird to gets real good.

3527
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:50,430
A guy wouldn't take a picture of me at a
meet and greet because I was.

3528
02:34:50,890 --> 02:34:53,840
Somebody just brought up the subject and
I don't fucking bring it up.

3529
02:34:53,841 --> 02:34:58,841
It might meet and greets or my show.
I used to do one bit about it and uh,

3530
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:04,060
that was barely could be conceived as 
anti trump.

3531
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:06,730
But uh,
because half my fucking fans,

3532
02:35:06,940 --> 02:35:10,900
I'm not gonna lose half my fan base over
a goddamn presidential election.

3533
02:35:10,901 --> 02:35:14,160
You can be as greedy.
I'm know I'm not a dixie chicks.

3534
02:35:14,230 --> 02:35:16,290
People will get mad at you about shit 
like this.

3535
02:35:16,750 --> 02:35:21,750
Literally they go is two girls with him 
and they took pictures because you're 

3536
02:35:22,540 --> 02:35:23,410
trying to take a picture.
He goes,

3537
02:35:23,950 --> 02:35:25,980
if he's not going to support trump,
I'm not going to take a picture.

3538
02:35:28,210 --> 02:35:29,060
And uh,
either what?

3539
02:35:29,180 --> 02:35:30,350
I said,
well,

3540
02:35:30,351 --> 02:35:31,520
you know what?
There's a door,

3541
02:35:31,521 --> 02:35:32,660
right?
The fuck there.

3542
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:35,900
And you can just walk there.
You can just walk the fuck out of it.

3543
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:38,180
Wow.
He wants to drain the swamp.

3544
02:35:38,940 --> 02:35:43,940
That's all it is.
Hashtag nobody's driving to know swamp 

3545
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:47,600
swamp being drained down there.
Dick Cheney emerging as key.

3546
02:35:47,601 --> 02:35:49,090
Trump advisor,
Jesus.

3547
02:35:49,130 --> 02:35:52,630
Jesus Christ.
Darth vader has returned.

3548
02:35:52,660 --> 02:35:54,780
Reagan,
Halliburton back into the of bitch

3549
02:35:55,030 --> 02:35:56,470
bom,
Bom,

3550
02:35:56,950 --> 02:35:57,970
Bom,
bom.

3551
02:35:58,510 --> 02:36:01,300
He's been on ice.
It turns out for eight years,

3552
02:36:01,540 --> 02:36:06,540
the only Dick Cheney that we've ever 
seen in news reports has been this 

3553
02:36:06,540 --> 02:36:09,511
artificial Dick Cheney's.
Dick Cheney's cryogenically frozen 

3554
02:36:09,511 --> 02:36:13,201
himself for eight years to get through 
the Obama administration and then the 

3555
02:36:13,201 --> 02:36:16,630
pop back up and then the administration.
It's a fully renewed and invigorated.

3556
02:36:16,910 --> 02:36:21,910
He couldn't go three months without 
having open heart surgery back when he 

3557
02:36:21,910 --> 02:36:22,310
was the Christ.
Ron White,

3558
02:36:22,670 --> 02:36:23,780
Jesus Christ.

3559
02:36:24,220 --> 02:36:29,220
You mean?
There was a point in time where Dick 

3560
02:36:29,220 --> 02:36:29,220
Cheney literally did not have a pulse 
and I was like,

3561
02:36:29,220 --> 02:36:30,860
Jesus Christ isn't this and the fucking 
Bible.

3562
02:36:31,170 --> 02:36:33,820
I'm going to really if you want to,
if you guys want to follow the Bible,

3563
02:36:33,830 --> 02:36:36,110
but the end of the world,
I don't know if it's in the Bible,

3564
02:36:36,140 --> 02:36:40,280
but he had a machine inside of the body 
that pumped his blood and it didn't make

3565
02:36:40,281 --> 02:36:45,281
a pulse,
so he didn't have a fucking pulse for a 

3566
02:36:45,281 --> 02:36:45,590
long time while he's waiting for a heart
transplant.

3567
02:36:46,190 --> 02:36:47,500
See,
Cheney has heart.

3568
02:36:47,540 --> 02:36:50,300
She's fucking popups.
Cheney has heart pump,

3569
02:36:50,301 --> 02:36:55,301
but no pulse white.
That's gotta be a Zombie.

3570
02:36:55,890 --> 02:36:58,140
Okay.
Are you excited?

3571
02:36:58,170 --> 02:36:59,460
Are you not?
I can't even tell you.

3572
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:02,370
I put my fingers on your neck and I 
don't feel shit.

3573
02:37:02,371 --> 02:37:05,030
You fucking vampire or you're still 
going.

3574
02:37:05,110 --> 02:37:06,750
You're still going.
You're still running.

3575
02:37:06,780 --> 02:37:11,780
Halliburton and here.
The steel in politics is not fly.

3576
02:37:15,060 --> 02:37:16,310
You know what?
I really

3577
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:17,810
thought.
I haven't heard his name.

3578
02:37:17,811 --> 02:37:19,090
In the years I've.
I'm like,

3579
02:37:19,140 --> 02:37:21,060
you,
I mean many years,

3580
02:37:21,170 --> 02:37:26,170
he had a heart transplant.
I had a joke that I could never figure 

3581
02:37:26,170 --> 02:37:28,661
out how to get to work.
It was about how one secret service 

3582
02:37:28,661 --> 02:37:30,290
agent realized he wasn't really a secret
service agent.

3583
02:37:30,710 --> 02:37:34,430
He just had the exact same blood type as
Dick Cheney and they'd be like,

3584
02:37:34,431 --> 02:37:35,690
well,
how am I going to eat food?

3585
02:37:35,691 --> 02:37:36,890
And you guys were eating Burgers,
man,

3586
02:37:36,891 --> 02:37:38,750
what the fuck?
And they just never told him.

3587
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:41,690
How come I got to run every day and you 
guys don't have to fucking run.

3588
02:37:41,870 --> 02:37:42,620
Shut up,
bitch,

3589
02:37:42,621 --> 02:37:44,780
get running.
And there was this Epi,

3590
02:37:44,910 --> 02:37:47,920
their car pacing with them smoking 
cigarettes and then.

3591
02:37:50,180 --> 02:37:55,180
And then one day Dick Cheney as a 
fucking heart attack and they opened 

3592
02:37:55,180 --> 02:37:58,391
that dude up like a fish and just scoop 
out his fucking do some roadside 

3593
02:37:58,550 --> 02:38:01,660
service,
figure out how to get to where.

3594
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:06,680
It's very funny,
but I don't know if you're going to get 

3595
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:06,680
it to work.
It's never going to work.

3596
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:10,030
It was terrible.
It was about heart attacks and dead 

3597
02:38:10,030 --> 02:38:10,900
people and not funny enough.
Yeah.

3598
02:38:11,070 --> 02:38:16,070
I got baby duck pussy lip tacos to work.
That was a one thing I can come from 

3599
02:38:16,281 --> 02:38:18,560
myself and is knowing that Dick Cheney 
did knock in,

3600
02:38:18,800 --> 02:38:23,800
get any advantage as far as waiting in 
line for a heart guarantee you it was 

3601
02:38:23,800 --> 02:38:27,080
100 percent fair and across the board.
Without a doubt,

3602
02:38:27,290 --> 02:38:32,290
Dick Cheney did not have any influence 
whatsoever in anyone moving him to the 

3603
02:38:32,961 --> 02:38:35,730
front of the line to get a young,
fresh 20 year old basketball players.

3604
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:37,400
Heart was definitely.
No,

3605
02:38:37,401 --> 02:38:38,030
no,
no,

3606
02:38:38,031 --> 02:38:39,400
no chance about it.
No,

3607
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:39,730
no,
no.

3608
02:38:40,140 --> 02:38:42,860
Absolutely not.
That the motorcycle victim.

3609
02:38:42,890 --> 02:38:47,890
Seventeen year old super stud athlete.
There's no way that heart is going into 

3610
02:38:47,890 --> 02:38:48,590
Dick Cheney's heart.
No,

3611
02:38:49,220 --> 02:38:51,620
it's not going to get it.
I would guess so.

3612
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:53,030
Yeah.
So,

3613
02:38:53,031 --> 02:38:54,380
uh,
how is he doing that?

3614
02:38:54,381 --> 02:38:56,370
Why did that happen?
Did he have A.

3615
02:38:57,080 --> 02:39:00,440
I don't know.
Does anybody know who know who,

3616
02:39:00,490 --> 02:39:04,430
whose heart was?
He had a transplant at age 71.

3617
02:39:04,460 --> 02:39:09,460
Jesus Christ son,
he suffered five heart attacks,

3618
02:39:13,311 --> 02:39:18,311
undergone open heart surgery,
multiple catherization ones.

3619
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:24,040
And,
and Joe Angioplasties had a 

3620
02:39:24,040 --> 02:39:27,791
defibrillator implanted in a pump 
attached directly to his heart.

3621
02:39:28,490 --> 02:39:32,840
All of that before his transplant at age
71 where some young,

3622
02:39:33,110 --> 02:39:38,110
strong man winter marries a sprinter,
they got some fucking kid from Iceland 

3623
02:39:39,261 --> 02:39:44,261
that dropped one of those ballots on his
head and they just grabbed him and just 

3624
02:39:44,261 --> 02:39:46,770
throw them on ice.
Settlers attacked.

3625
02:39:47,180 --> 02:39:50,930
Just keep alive.
Jack's going to be your search and bring

3626
02:39:50,931 --> 02:39:55,931
this thing back around.
We're going to be fine and that fucking 

3627
02:39:55,971 --> 02:39:58,400
super hearts and Dick Cheney,
all of a sudden you see him.

3628
02:39:59,030 --> 02:40:02,900
Posture looks better.
Face starts to suck in a little bit.

3629
02:40:02,930 --> 02:40:05,420
Loses the jowls.
Hair's growing back.

3630
02:40:05,450 --> 02:40:07,880
I just don't know why I got like that.
Would want to still be in the business.

3631
02:40:08,690 --> 02:40:13,690
Look at this stage of the game.
Like is it just he doesn't want to bail 

3632
02:40:13,690 --> 02:40:14,050
out money.
Halliburton was like

3633
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:19,160
$150,
million dollars and that was to become a

3634
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:23,570
vice president.
So you know,

3635
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:25,110
I don't know.
I have no idea.

3636
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:26,900
I have no idea what drives any of those 
videos.

3637
02:40:27,470 --> 02:40:29,010
Yeah,
that's what you would get a worry.

3638
02:40:29,011 --> 02:40:30,360
Like what,
what?

3639
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:35,600
What's the end game like?
Where are you going when you're working 

3640
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:35,600
that hard?
At 70,

3641
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:39,650
what do you,
what are you shooting for you trying to 

3642
02:40:39,650 --> 02:40:39,650
save the world.
He trying to tell people how it is.

3643
02:40:39,650 --> 02:40:40,770
What is it?
I wonder,

3644
02:40:40,890 --> 02:40:42,030
you know,
catch.

3645
02:40:43,570 --> 02:40:44,760
Keep making money,
right?

3646
02:40:44,790 --> 02:40:47,100
Can it be ego?
Maybe.

3647
02:40:47,820 --> 02:40:49,620
Maybe while you're alive,
you're just alive.

3648
02:40:49,650 --> 02:40:52,590
Maybe all of these ideas that we have 
about people getting older and wiser.

3649
02:40:52,591 --> 02:40:55,500
Maybe I'll all just bullshit.
Maybe you just get older,

3650
02:40:55,710 --> 02:41:00,210
like a lot of people get older.
So if they're fucking crazy when they're

3651
02:41:00,211 --> 02:41:05,211
30 and they want to take over the world,
why do we automatically expect them to 

3652
02:41:05,211 --> 02:41:07,050
be on some path of self regulation and 
improvement?

3653
02:41:07,410 --> 02:41:12,410
The point where they become enlightened 
and they don't want to take over the 

3654
02:41:12,410 --> 02:41:15,981
world anymore.
Now they're 17 and they've had 15 open 

3655
02:41:15,981 --> 02:41:15,981
heart surgeries.
But no,

3656
02:41:15,981 --> 02:41:16,470
it doesn't.

3657
02:41:17,140 --> 02:41:22,140
They're just people.
My goodness gracious Joe Rogan.

3658
02:41:23,100 --> 02:41:24,670
Hey,
you know what the,

3659
02:41:24,671 --> 02:41:25,090
uh,

3660
02:41:26,010 --> 02:41:26,880
I,
uh,

3661
02:41:28,960 --> 02:41:30,310
I think that,
uh,

3662
02:41:30,311 --> 02:41:35,311
that uh,
this has been a lot of fun and I love 

3663
02:41:35,311 --> 02:41:35,311
you to death.
I think it's been a lot of fun.

3664
02:41:35,311 --> 02:41:37,210
I love you to death as well.
And uh,

3665
02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:38,200
the,
you know what?

3666
02:41:38,201 --> 02:41:40,840
I can't believe it took us this long to 
go do this.

3667
02:41:40,850 --> 02:41:45,850
Uh,
this thing I've been getting so fucked 

3668
02:41:45,850 --> 02:41:45,850
up that I can't respond anymore.
You're fine.

3669
02:41:45,850 --> 02:41:48,280
So it's always better if I just don't 
respond.

3670
02:41:48,281 --> 02:41:49,540
If I,
once I get this fucked up,

3671
02:41:49,541 --> 02:41:51,310
I completely understand your position

3672
02:41:51,790 --> 02:41:56,790
from a fan's perspective and a friend.
You've been amazing and fine and you 

3673
02:41:57,641 --> 02:42:00,430
could skate right through this like a 
goddamned champion,

3674
02:42:00,700 --> 02:42:05,700
like,
like a Tonya harding before the 

3675
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:05,700
incident,

3676
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:07,520
right?
Good Lord.

3677
02:42:07,660 --> 02:42:11,710
A little freak.
It shows good last.

3678
02:42:11,720 --> 02:42:12,750
She was amazing.
That's you.

3679
02:42:13,310 --> 02:42:14,000
That's you right now

3680
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:18,120
if you'd like every great comic,
you have a low self opinion of yourself.

3681
02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:22,290
The it takes a certain amount of ego was
a great year to say.

3682
02:42:22,410 --> 02:42:27,410
I'm telling you right now.
It takes a certain amount of ego to be 

3683
02:42:27,410 --> 02:42:30,291
great and then a certain amount of ego 
to move past that where you have to 

3684
02:42:30,291 --> 02:42:30,480
understand your ego and you're one of 
those.

3685
02:42:30,481 --> 02:42:35,481
Understand your ego guys.
And so you squash that motherfucker 

3686
02:42:35,481 --> 02:42:37,971
every time it gets.
So you're always looking for self 

3687
02:42:37,971 --> 02:42:37,971
deprecating moments in being in front of
people that love you.

3688
02:42:38,230 --> 02:42:39,140
Well,
maybe I do.

3689
02:42:39,260 --> 02:42:42,620
Maybe I do it.
It's because you're a bad motherfucker.

3690
02:42:43,070 --> 02:42:46,100
There's no way you wouldn't be if he 
wouldn't be as funny.

3691
02:42:46,110 --> 02:42:46,880
It's,
that's,

3692
02:42:46,910 --> 02:42:48,620
that's a whole part of the whole thing,
man.

3693
02:42:49,880 --> 02:42:50,640
You know,
and uh,

3694
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:55,660
getting to know you and be friends with 
you at the comedy store has been really 

3695
02:42:55,660 --> 02:42:55,660
fun,
man.

3696
02:42:55,660 --> 02:42:55,660
Because,
uh,

3697
02:42:55,660 --> 02:42:56,570
I love your comedy.
Have always love your comedy.

3698
02:42:56,571 --> 02:42:59,480
I love watching you work shit out.
I love hanging out with you.

3699
02:42:59,990 --> 02:43:01,010
It's just fun,
man.

3700
02:43:01,070 --> 02:43:06,070
It was just fun.
And having you on here has been just 

3701
02:43:06,070 --> 02:43:06,070
nothing but a blast.

3702
02:43:06,070 --> 02:43:09,080
I knew it would be.
So right now we're saying no,

3703
02:43:09,081 --> 02:43:14,081
don't stop.
I still have to drive 45 minutes to get 

3704
02:43:14,081 --> 02:43:16,710
to New Hampshire,
New Hampshire.

3705
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:22,200
Fuck yeah.
They listen to this shit and Dubai and 

3706
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:22,200
Dubai,
we,

3707
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:22,240
God it,
we have gotten worked there.

3708
02:43:22,241 --> 02:43:24,130
If you wouldn't have been disciplined 
was just being honest with

3709
02:43:24,140 --> 02:43:25,250
dumb.
They're going to get straight in there.

3710
02:43:25,440 --> 02:43:26,120
The game up

3711
02:43:26,510 --> 02:43:28,950
can arrest people from saying the wrong 
magic word.

3712
02:43:28,980 --> 02:43:29,900
They do.
You know?

3713
02:43:30,030 --> 02:43:35,030
I don't know if they do,
but I just really want to get the game 

3714
02:43:35,030 --> 02:43:35,030
up.
Uh,

3715
02:43:35,030 --> 02:43:35,940
you know,
at some point,

3716
02:43:35,941 --> 02:43:40,941
you know,
I did that to getting high with getting 

3717
02:43:40,941 --> 02:43:40,941
doug with high or whatever.
How was that?

3718
02:43:40,941 --> 02:43:42,030
I got so fucked up.
I couldn't,

3719
02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:47,240
I couldn't even think.
Doug wasn't there like a flight 

3720
02:43:47,240 --> 02:43:49,551
attendant trying to bring you back into 
the runway with Josh who smokes more 

3721
02:43:49,551 --> 02:43:52,520
weed than anybody.
And a blue.

3722
02:43:52,530 --> 02:43:57,530
The comedian's comedian from Denver who 
won last comic standing and who he has 

3723
02:43:57,530 --> 02:43:57,930
cerebral palsy.
Right.

3724
02:43:58,060 --> 02:44:03,060
Funny as fuck.
He mean he's one of the rare people that

3725
02:44:03,481 --> 02:44:06,330
actually uses medical marijuana.
You can watch it.

3726
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:11,360
You can watch it relaxes at that fucking
tension is fucking muscular dystrophy 

3727
02:44:11,360 --> 02:44:11,810
arm or whatever the fuck it is.
Yeah.

3728
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:16,840
It's good to bring up.
Very important to bring it up because 

3729
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:18,600
that sets a clear beneficiary of actual 
medical marijuana unlike you or me.

3730
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:21,630
Oh no,
that's not using it for Madison.

3731
02:44:21,730 --> 02:44:26,370
You know what I,
I was taking Xanax to sleep,

3732
02:44:26,670 --> 02:44:28,770
to know,
to get up,

3733
02:44:29,580 --> 02:44:32,370
just to,
just to get out of bed for awhile.

3734
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:35,280
Who?
Xanax is a tricky one.

3735
02:44:35,660 --> 02:44:36,780
Yeah.
How about,

3736
02:44:36,860 --> 02:44:37,720
how long did you take it for?

3737
02:44:39,770 --> 02:44:41,550
Twenty six years.
Jesus Christ.

3738
02:44:45,170 --> 02:44:47,560
Pharmacological expert.
Yet though I'm not,

3739
02:44:47,630 --> 02:44:50,180
I'm not understanding because I'm good.
I'm good.

3740
02:44:50,240 --> 02:44:53,030
The uh,
I spoke a lot of weed and that's good.

3741
02:44:53,031 --> 02:44:53,750
And uh,
you know,

3742
02:44:53,751 --> 02:44:55,760
I drink a lot of Tequila,
but I'd really,

3743
02:44:56,100 --> 02:44:59,060
I'd like to thank the Jj for sending 
this over.

3744
02:44:59,990 --> 02:45:01,130
Fucking delicious

3745
02:45:01,870 --> 02:45:06,870
a wow man.
I think I,

3746
02:45:08,390 --> 02:45:12,550
I think we're all real lucky right now.
I think it's just a perspective issue.

3747
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:18,120
It's really a perspective issue of 
understanding what a strange time this 

3748
02:45:18,120 --> 02:45:18,120
is,
you know,

3749
02:45:18,120 --> 02:45:22,320
for all of us.
Well everybody's freaking out about 

3750
02:45:22,320 --> 02:45:24,841
trump and freaking out about the future 
and what are they going to do with 

3751
02:45:24,841 --> 02:45:27,211
Russia?
Fuck's gonna are you worried about 

3752
02:45:27,211 --> 02:45:29,521
Russia?
How often is in Ron White's day as ron 

3753
02:45:29,521 --> 02:45:30,010
might worry about fucking Russia 
throughout,

3754
02:45:30,590 --> 02:45:32,040
you know,
we're already dead.

3755
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:34,080
So,
I mean,

3756
02:45:34,081 --> 02:45:35,220
in my,
in my opinion,

3757
02:45:35,250 --> 02:45:37,250
there's,
I don't know,

3758
02:45:37,290 --> 02:45:39,840
I don't worry about Russia,
I really don't even think about Russia,

3759
02:45:39,841 --> 02:45:42,070
but I also don't think about any of it.
Uh,

3760
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:43,670
I mean not,
not on,

3761
02:45:43,671 --> 02:45:45,890
not in details.
I don't know.

3762
02:45:45,900 --> 02:45:48,220
I was a presidential candidate for my 
paperwork.

3763
02:45:48,221 --> 02:45:53,221
It was completely filled out.
I was a candidate for the president in 

3764
02:45:53,221 --> 02:45:53,221
that space to hear.

3765
02:45:53,221 --> 02:45:56,120
How dare you put who put you in?
I did.

3766
02:45:56,570 --> 02:46:01,570
You put yourself in now you a part of 
the Bilderberg group or you have a 

3767
02:46:01,570 --> 02:46:05,141
supporter of any sort of the Illuminati.
Anything that's going on is ruling the 

3768
02:46:05,361 --> 02:46:06,270
world.
Ryan White?

3769
02:46:06,340 --> 02:46:11,340
No.
You're just going to run for president 

3770
02:46:11,340 --> 02:46:11,340
as a normal.
Normal dude.

3771
02:46:11,340 --> 02:46:11,340
How come I didn't

3772
02:46:11,340 --> 02:46:12,680
hear about this until right now?
I don't know.

3773
02:46:12,681 --> 02:46:13,940
Research.
Uh,

3774
02:46:14,210 --> 02:46:17,540
how the fuck am I supposed to know you 
ran for president will look at credit.

3775
02:46:17,541 --> 02:46:21,980
Pull up Broadway for president.
Who to try to make the election.

3776
02:46:22,010 --> 02:46:23,570
Are you willing to do it again for 
years?

3777
02:46:23,630 --> 02:46:24,380
No,
no,

3778
02:46:24,590 --> 02:46:25,280
no,
no.

3779
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:30,340
It scared me.
Was that I didn't realize anybody was 

3780
02:46:30,340 --> 02:46:31,640
taking this seriously.
Oh my God.

3781
02:46:31,641 --> 02:46:35,630
Ron Wind for president.
Vote smart because you can't fix stupid.

3782
02:46:39,740 --> 02:46:42,190
That's me at my house.
And uh,

3783
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:44,410
does

3784
02:46:46,830 --> 02:46:51,830
I made that face before.
So I don't know where they got that 

3785
02:46:51,830 --> 02:46:52,530
image,
but it's certainly not me.

3786
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:57,600
How weird man.
And so what happened,

3787
02:46:57,660 --> 02:47:02,660
people took it seriously,
help support service members on drugs,

3788
02:47:05,280 --> 02:47:10,260
war on meth thing.
There's a that I felt like because I,

3789
02:47:10,580 --> 02:47:11,880
you know,
I have the same,

3790
02:47:12,630 --> 02:47:17,630
have a comics perspective of the 
American people,

3791
02:47:18,870 --> 02:47:20,370
which means for the last 30 years,
yeah,

3792
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:25,400
my laugh,
I've done nothing but travel back and 

3793
02:47:25,400 --> 02:47:25,850
forth across this country,
up upside,

3794
02:47:25,851 --> 02:47:27,770
downside.
One left to right,

3795
02:47:27,771 --> 02:47:31,970
right to left.
And I've made these people laugh.

3796
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:35,030
I've drank with them in bars,
had dinner in their homes,

3797
02:47:35,031 --> 02:47:37,280
have cried with them when their kids 
died in,

3798
02:47:37,330 --> 02:47:38,270
uh,
you know,

3799
02:47:38,330 --> 02:47:41,720
I know Donald Trump doesn't know nobody 
else up there though.

3800
02:47:41,900 --> 02:47:43,160
I know,
you know,

3801
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:47,240
I know who they are and know exactly who
they are and know what bothers him.

3802
02:47:47,660 --> 02:47:49,250
And it was,
he was a bothersome.

3803
02:47:49,430 --> 02:47:53,540
Is the fucking math is just killing 
everybody.

3804
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:55,420
And uh,
and,

3805
02:47:55,520 --> 02:48:00,520
and,
and nobody ever brought that up in this 

3806
02:48:00,520 --> 02:48:00,620
election.
Did math,

3807
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:03,740
the math.
Even the meth made here and not even the

3808
02:48:03,741 --> 02:48:08,320
meth from Mexico.
The meth made here in America is a,

3809
02:48:08,390 --> 02:48:11,840
is it kills more people than isis ever 
will in this country.

3810
02:48:11,841 --> 02:48:13,580
And unless something fucking,
I mean,

3811
02:48:13,581 --> 02:48:15,440
you know,
this is going on right now.

3812
02:48:15,441 --> 02:48:16,740
100 people a day.
Dad,

3813
02:48:16,750 --> 02:48:17,370
Dad,
dad,

3814
02:48:17,540 --> 02:48:19,080
everyday.
Hundred people a day.

3815
02:48:19,270 --> 02:48:21,410
Dad over the either the

3816
02:48:23,060 --> 02:48:25,790
byproducts of doing math over a period 
of time.

3817
02:48:25,791 --> 02:48:29,570
That 100 people a day easy.
How many people die from skateboarding?

3818
02:48:30,290 --> 02:48:35,290
Google that.
I'd say a half a person today you think?

3819
02:48:36,020 --> 02:48:41,020
Yeah.
What do you think is the most dangerous 

3820
02:48:41,020 --> 02:48:41,020
sport that people die from a day at 
Honeywell?

3821
02:48:41,020 --> 02:48:42,020
For Math.
If,

3822
02:48:42,021 --> 02:48:43,460
uh,
if it would have been.

3823
02:48:43,461 --> 02:48:45,620
If I hadn't been elected president,
here's what,

3824
02:48:45,621 --> 02:48:47,120
here's my plan.
A,

3825
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:52,200
the.
So this would have been the most 

3826
02:48:52,200 --> 02:48:52,200
dangerous sport would have been run a 
math lab.

3827
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:54,350
That would have been the most dangerous 
sport.

3828
02:48:54,940 --> 02:48:59,940
That was a.
because I wouldn't put US troops on the 

3829
02:48:59,940 --> 02:49:03,110
ground and I would.
And I would put a bounty of $20,000.

3830
02:49:03,111 --> 02:49:06,950
If you can show me an operating math lab
will go in there,

3831
02:49:07,020 --> 02:49:09,810
boots on the ground.
We'll give you eight seconds to get with

3832
02:49:09,820 --> 02:49:14,820
the meth babies.
And then we're going to kill everybody 

3833
02:49:14,820 --> 02:49:14,820
in the fucking place and we're going to 
blow the place up.

3834
02:49:14,820 --> 02:49:15,060
You would kill the dude from breaking 
bad.

3835
02:49:15,550 --> 02:49:17,640
You know?
I don't think that's real.

3836
02:49:17,910 --> 02:49:19,180
But if it was a real.
Yeah.

3837
02:49:19,410 --> 02:49:22,710
Fucked fuck yeah.
He's because he's killing people,

3838
02:49:22,840 --> 02:49:24,030
right?
He knows he's doing it.

3839
02:49:24,540 --> 02:49:27,380
He knows he's doing it.
They're doing it with just for profit.

3840
02:49:27,390 --> 02:49:30,630
He is a prophet here.
Could you just enjoy a little math?

3841
02:49:30,631 --> 02:49:33,110
Like a wine tasting?
It's just a little.

3842
02:49:33,111 --> 02:49:35,580
Just a.
So I could,

3843
02:49:35,581 --> 02:49:38,220
but still I would like to see if the 
navy seals did meth.

3844
02:49:38,400 --> 02:49:41,520
If you could take like guys with a 
tremendous amount of discipline.

3845
02:49:41,790 --> 02:49:44,760
Like if you got Tim Kennedy to do math 
one time,

3846
02:49:44,910 --> 02:49:49,910
I guarantee he's not going to become a 
math junkie or crack crack cocaine is 

3847
02:49:49,910 --> 02:49:51,300
even more addictive.
Is it then.

3848
02:49:51,410 --> 02:49:52,200
But,
but math,

3849
02:49:52,280 --> 02:49:57,280
you know,
you watched the deterioration of 

3850
02:49:57,280 --> 02:49:57,280
somebody on math over a 10 year period 
of time.

3851
02:49:57,280 --> 02:50:00,980
It could be a most beautiful woman in 
the world all the way down to the skank 

3852
02:50:00,980 --> 02:50:03,750
and 10 years complete toothless.
Fucking is horrible for him.

3853
02:50:04,950 --> 02:50:06,090
Yeah man.
We're going deep,

3854
02:50:06,091 --> 02:50:09,720
deep down the world of neither one of us
know what the fuck we're talking about.

3855
02:50:09,810 --> 02:50:10,650
No,
no,

3856
02:50:12,910 --> 02:50:13,720
absolutely.

3857
02:50:15,860 --> 02:50:19,940
I told you some meth.
I've told you a while ago.

3858
02:50:19,950 --> 02:50:21,610
I'm too fucked up to keep doing the 
show.

3859
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:26,640
You're the one that kept going fine.
We're just in a civil debate about 

3860
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:31,521
whether or not a navy seal could smoke a
little meth and just put it down and 

3861
02:50:31,521 --> 02:50:34,230
walk away because it's not a bitch.
Okay.

3862
02:50:35,010 --> 02:50:35,760
No,
I ain't.

3863
02:50:35,820 --> 02:50:37,300
He grabs your DNA,
doesn't it?

3864
02:50:37,950 --> 02:50:39,850
I think a navy seal.
I don't think Nav,

3865
02:50:39,870 --> 02:50:44,870
so we'd do it in the first place.
That's the whole key to the 

3866
02:50:44,870 --> 02:50:46,020
investigation that the army had to find 
out.

3867
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:46,860
Is it?
What is it?

3868
02:50:46,861 --> 02:50:50,040
Is it willpower?
Is a physical like what's the deal?

3869
02:50:50,420 --> 02:50:55,080
It'd be sucking a dick for a sandwich in
the know they don't want sandwiches.

3870
02:50:55,081 --> 02:50:58,170
They want meth.
Yeah,

3871
02:50:58,370 --> 02:51:00,220
they right.
If they have math,

3872
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:04,890
the sandwich has no importance.
It seems like for a lot of people that's

3873
02:51:04,891 --> 02:51:07,020
the case,
but the question is how?

3874
02:51:07,080 --> 02:51:10,110
How even our.
We all of us like how many?

3875
02:51:10,250 --> 02:51:12,480
Why?
Why do some people have cat allergies?

3876
02:51:12,481 --> 02:51:13,950
Why did some people have pain or 
analogy?

3877
02:51:13,951 --> 02:51:15,060
It's like,
what the fuck's going on?

3878
02:51:15,270 --> 02:51:17,820
How many people that smoke meth?
Just smoke it and they go,

3879
02:51:17,821 --> 02:51:20,530
look.
How many people smoke meth in pain?

3880
02:51:20,680 --> 02:51:23,970
Just his size.
I note like we did with me and you.

3881
02:51:24,210 --> 02:51:25,240
I don't think we know.
Right?

3882
02:51:25,260 --> 02:51:30,260
Right.
Because some people smoke pot and they 

3883
02:51:30,260 --> 02:51:30,260
go,
well,

3884
02:51:30,260 --> 02:51:30,260
I'll never do that again.
But I didn't say that.

3885
02:51:30,260 --> 02:51:31,130
You didn't say that?
No.

3886
02:51:31,490 --> 02:51:33,660
Uh,
I don't like things that make me vibrate

3887
02:51:34,320 --> 02:51:35,910
and I liked it.
I liked it.

3888
02:51:36,530 --> 02:51:38,850
I like to nap.
Responsible,

3889
02:51:38,851 --> 02:51:40,980
methamphetamine,
use and community.

3890
02:51:42,500 --> 02:51:47,500
I use math on occasion.
It was crazy before work.

3891
02:51:50,910 --> 02:51:53,520
Oh my God.
I don't know if this is real,

3892
02:51:53,521 --> 02:51:56,460
but I mean there are people apparently 
that agree with them and there's a whole

3893
02:51:56,461 --> 02:51:58,680
community course.
They do a bunch of methods.

3894
02:51:58,980 --> 02:52:03,980
Methods are all getting together on each
other's fingers off saying everything's 

3895
02:52:03,980 --> 02:52:06,800
fine and you know,
who is pitching in to the fucking or 

3896
02:52:06,800 --> 02:52:06,800
fucking

3897
02:52:06,800 --> 02:52:06,800
going.
Yeah.

3898
02:52:06,800 --> 02:52:11,671
Yeah.
Do a little math to a little math gonna 

3899
02:52:11,671 --> 02:52:13,901
make you a metal team.
That will do from the James Bond movie 

3900
02:52:14,380 --> 02:52:15,430
jaws.
Remember that guy?

3901
02:52:16,390 --> 02:52:19,930
Metal teeth for a while,
rappers were going with the metal teeth.

3902
02:52:19,931 --> 02:52:23,560
Jamie,
has that led up interesting to grill?

3903
02:52:23,970 --> 02:52:28,970
Yeah.
You agree that grills are still in full 

3904
02:52:28,970 --> 02:52:28,970
force.
Interesting.

3905
02:52:28,970 --> 02:52:31,981
Ron,
why have you ever considered getting a 

3906
02:52:31,981 --> 02:52:33,391
grill?
Like maybe perhaps something like 

3907
02:52:33,391 --> 02:52:33,391
platinum and diamonds,
something?

3908
02:52:33,391 --> 02:52:33,790
Nope.
Nothing.

3909
02:52:33,940 --> 02:52:36,780
No little wayne ask.
Perhaps.

3910
02:52:37,780 --> 02:52:41,190
That's when Cameron decided to make my 
character ball.

3911
02:52:41,210 --> 02:52:43,210
I don't know if you ever saw it or not,
but it was pretty funny.

3912
02:52:43,660 --> 02:52:45,610
You laugh at it.
Did you see him?

3913
02:52:45,611 --> 02:52:47,680
That character?
I didn't see that show once.

3914
02:52:48,940 --> 02:52:52,260
If I had known that in any way I could 
have helped and kept it on the air.

3915
02:52:52,261 --> 02:52:56,080
I want to watch every episode.
Find out who's watching.

3916
02:52:58,330 --> 02:53:01,870
How do they find out a dick for not have
watched your show now?

3917
02:53:02,590 --> 02:53:04,780
I think I probably wanted to get around 
to it,

3918
02:53:05,230 --> 02:53:07,030
but there's a lot of shit.
Like I haven't seen that.

3919
02:53:07,230 --> 02:53:10,180
Uh,
who's the black superhero?

3920
02:53:11,070 --> 02:53:12,280
Luke.
Luke cage.

3921
02:53:12,880 --> 02:53:15,040
I want to see that show.
I keep hearing awesome things about it.

3922
02:53:16,360 --> 02:53:18,430
Now I'm in trouble because I said the 
black superhero,

3923
02:53:18,910 --> 02:53:21,770
even though he's exactly that.
What other ones?

3924
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:23,820
Like netflix has a couple of.
They have daredevil.

3925
02:53:24,120 --> 02:53:26,500
They have luke cage.
What else they have on a shirt?

3926
02:53:26,501 --> 02:53:27,160
I think.
Oh,

3927
02:53:27,161 --> 02:53:28,450
they have the punisher.
That's right.

3928
02:53:28,451 --> 02:53:30,130
That's what I'm hearing.
Good things about that too.

3929
02:53:30,131 --> 02:53:33,700
But more about luke cage than anything.
Heard a lot of people.

3930
02:53:34,030 --> 02:53:35,440
If somebody has a bit about luke.
Oh,

3931
02:53:35,770 --> 02:53:37,230
John Horton.
Horton.

3932
02:53:37,260 --> 02:53:40,210
As a really funny bit about Luke Cage.
John Horton,

3933
02:53:40,211 --> 02:53:42,880
who uh,
opened up for me in Denver at the comedy

3934
02:53:42,881 --> 02:53:43,210
works.

3935
02:53:43,270 --> 02:53:44,910
Yeah.
No,

3936
02:53:44,920 --> 02:53:46,060
he's from here.
He's from La.

3937
02:53:46,790 --> 02:53:49,250
He brought an opener all the way from 
money,

3938
02:53:49,270 --> 02:53:51,100
man.
I always bring opener so you don't bring

3939
02:53:51,101 --> 02:53:53,690
openers.
What are you doing?

3940
02:53:55,180 --> 02:53:57,700
What's happening there?
That's my character.

3941
02:53:57,790 --> 02:53:58,990
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

3942
02:53:59,110 --> 02:54:04,110
What does he do to you?
How rude and balled it made you look 

3943
02:54:04,110 --> 02:54:04,110
like?
Shit.

3944
02:54:04,110 --> 02:54:08,490
I like the glasses though.
And the t shirt with glasses that they 

3945
02:54:08,490 --> 02:54:11,740
did a lack of fucking audition.
Fast as fuck them.

3946
02:54:12,130 --> 02:54:14,270
That's funny man.
Yeah.

3947
02:54:14,770 --> 02:54:17,040
So do you enjoy doing that show though?
Yeah.

3948
02:54:17,880 --> 02:54:18,700
Yeah.
It was a blast.

3949
02:54:18,701 --> 02:54:19,460
It was,
it was,

3950
02:54:19,480 --> 02:54:19,900
uh,
the,

3951
02:54:19,901 --> 02:54:22,310
the,
the dialogue was a blast to do you know,

3952
02:54:22,370 --> 02:54:22,870
you'll,
you'll,

3953
02:54:23,010 --> 02:54:24,970
you'd lack it.
You watched episode eight.

3954
02:54:25,330 --> 02:54:28,420
Is it available on Netflix or a.
you've got to go to the showtime APP.

3955
02:54:28,421 --> 02:54:33,421
I know I have showed.
Do they do it on demand because on 

3956
02:54:33,421 --> 02:54:33,421
demand,
I don't know.

3957
02:54:33,421 --> 02:54:36,610
I saw it was on a,
I think it was a Delta flight.

3958
02:54:36,810 --> 02:54:41,810
I think right now those providers,
all these different people trying to 

3959
02:54:41,810 --> 02:54:42,940
figure out how to get that straight so 
you can watch pretty much.

3960
02:54:43,320 --> 02:54:44,650
I mean,
how many years do you think,

3961
02:54:44,651 --> 02:54:46,960
if you're realistic,
how many years are we away from?

3962
02:54:46,961 --> 02:54:51,961
Everything that everyone makes.
Being able to be watched online per real

3963
02:54:52,001 --> 02:54:57,001
close.
It's just got to be some universal 

3964
02:54:57,001 --> 02:54:57,250
currency thing.
So the universal one click like Amazon,

3965
02:54:57,370 --> 02:55:02,370
something along those lines.
We can get things on the spot right 

3966
02:55:02,370 --> 02:55:05,371
after they come out because you know 
it's going to massively increase how 

3967
02:55:05,371 --> 02:55:10,361
many people watch your show or any show 
because some people just don't want to 

3968
02:55:10,361 --> 02:55:13,181
pay for that showtime package.
Maybe they're broke and they have one 

3969
02:55:13,181 --> 02:55:13,181
chance,
like,

3970
02:55:13,181 --> 02:55:13,490
what do you want to,
oh,

3971
02:55:13,491 --> 02:55:14,990
let's get hbo.
You know?

3972
02:55:15,080 --> 02:55:16,310
Or maybe they were really cheap and 
they're like,

3973
02:55:16,311 --> 02:55:16,460
oh.

3974
02:55:16,760 --> 02:55:20,030
With cinemax said,
cinemax actually only was,

3975
02:55:20,040 --> 02:55:22,230
I call it 50 bucks.
I don't know.

3976
02:55:22,280 --> 02:55:23,690
I don't know what it costs.
I have no idea.

3977
02:55:23,720 --> 02:55:25,430
Cinemax is awesome because that's not my
point.

3978
02:55:25,700 --> 02:55:29,660
I point is that if you have it online,
if it's easy to get to,

3979
02:55:30,050 --> 02:55:33,830
you get this open river.
It's like the blockades you put up where

3980
02:55:33,831 --> 02:55:36,890
it makes it hard for people to buy shit.
That's what fucks everything up.

3981
02:55:37,460 --> 02:55:39,800
I call you want me to sign up A.
I don't want to sign up.

3982
02:55:39,980 --> 02:55:42,620
I gotta put my email address here.
Comes to spam.

3983
02:55:42,950 --> 02:55:47,950
If there was just some one easy way that
you could put that fucking thing online 

3984
02:55:48,320 --> 02:55:52,110
is one simple way where everybody could 
just give you like a book or whatever it

3985
02:55:52,111 --> 02:55:54,080
is for an episode.
Just really easy.

3986
02:55:54,320 --> 02:55:57,350
Let me watch the episode real quick.
You know,

3987
02:55:58,170 --> 02:56:00,710
God damn everywhere.
It'd be everywhere,

3988
02:56:00,950 --> 02:56:03,590
everywhere,
everywhere.

3989
02:56:03,620 --> 02:56:07,160
It's just too right now.
It's too complicated right now.

3990
02:56:07,161 --> 02:56:10,370
They're trying to figure out that the 
various portals for people to be able to

3991
02:56:10,371 --> 02:56:13,310
profit off these things.
How do we start this?

3992
02:56:13,390 --> 02:56:18,390
I can't wait.
I can't wait because I don't profit off 

3993
02:56:18,390 --> 02:56:22,470
the internet at all at all.
You definitely do because people on the 

3994
02:56:22,470 --> 02:56:22,470
Internet.
I love you.

3995
02:56:22,470 --> 02:56:23,120
So they come see you

3996
02:56:23,160 --> 02:56:23,990
well there.
Yeah.

3997
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,610
In that way they do you know that?
I'd do that.

3998
02:56:26,850 --> 02:56:28,500
Yeah.
That's a big part of it.

3999
02:56:28,620 --> 02:56:31,290
Right?
To get the run white shell started.

4000
02:56:32,340 --> 02:56:37,050
Jamie is important.
Needs to be done right now.

4001
02:56:37,610 --> 02:56:42,610
Now what do you mean the podcast?
You shouldn't do something like once a 

4002
02:56:42,610 --> 02:56:43,170
month now.
I went to once a month.

4003
02:56:43,620 --> 02:56:46,350
Once a month.
It's not that much time for an hour.

4004
02:56:47,070 --> 02:56:48,960
Brian White answers questions.
All right.

4005
02:56:48,961 --> 02:56:53,961
I'll do that here.
You don't have to put you on the spot.

4006
02:56:58,800 --> 02:56:59,790
No,
I feel bad now.

4007
02:57:00,690 --> 02:57:03,860
Now to do it.
But once a month.

4008
02:57:03,861 --> 02:57:08,861
Nobody said that once a month.
So we already said that everybody else 

4009
02:57:08,861 --> 02:57:11,570
is like 17 days a week and I only have 
17 days a week and fucking do this shit.

4010
02:57:11,750 --> 02:57:13,110
So what else are you going to tell you 
earlier?

4011
02:57:13,680 --> 02:57:18,680
I would never encourage any changing of 
any of what you do because then you 

4012
02:57:19,381 --> 02:57:23,580
wouldn't be ron white.
But if ron white decides at one point in

4013
02:57:23,581 --> 02:57:25,950
time that he wants to change whatever 
behavior,

4014
02:57:26,390 --> 02:57:31,390
if Ron Wyden decides that he wants to 
start drinking carrot and ginger and 

4015
02:57:31,390 --> 02:57:33,470
garlic juice every morning going to the 
fucking crossfit gym.

4016
02:57:33,650 --> 02:57:37,970
I'm drinking Jack Daniels reviewed Mr.
mixed message.

4017
02:57:38,480 --> 02:57:40,520
I am definitely a mixed message.
You are

4018
02:57:40,980 --> 02:57:43,800
present and uh,
I'm guilty as charged.

4019
02:57:44,100 --> 02:57:49,100
Just trying to squeeze as much life out 
of this thing is we can run white and 

4020
02:57:49,110 --> 02:57:53,310
middle school,
but I'm not sure that helps.

4021
02:57:53,550 --> 02:57:54,540
I don't think so either.
The

4022
02:57:54,540 --> 02:57:56,950
uh,
the expression is little old band,

4023
02:57:58,030 --> 02:58:00,300
not big old man.
Old Man.

4024
02:58:00,970 --> 02:58:02,160
You never hear anybody

4025
02:58:02,160 --> 02:58:03,110
say big old man.

4026
02:58:05,590 --> 02:58:10,590
Tiny little loop for that is the great 
grave pulling him towards it.

4027
02:58:14,861 --> 02:58:19,861
How fucked up is that?
That's ultimately what is actually 

4028
02:58:19,861 --> 02:58:19,861
happening to your body.
As you get older,

4029
02:58:19,861 --> 02:58:24,510
you have a stick to fight off the slow 
pull of gravity nation.

4030
02:58:25,450 --> 02:58:26,310
That's just stuck

4031
02:58:26,320 --> 02:58:29,170
one window.
It's undeniable.

4032
02:58:29,730 --> 02:58:34,020
Then pull that you could use to kick 
your ass when you were a baby

4033
02:58:35,370 --> 02:58:40,370
and you just fall over and kick your ass
all the time and you got a little 

4034
02:58:40,370 --> 02:58:44,751
stronger and then it got to where you 
could fucking run and didn't get to 

4035
02:58:44,751 --> 02:58:46,380
where you could job and you're like 
kicking.

4036
02:58:46,381 --> 02:58:50,610
Gravity's asked for a few years and let 
gravity never stopped.

4037
02:58:50,790 --> 02:58:53,150
Never gravity.
Never fucking stopped.

4038
02:58:53,180 --> 02:58:56,250
Gravity kept on fucking tug on your 
goddamn ass.

4039
02:58:56,330 --> 02:58:59,100
Gravity's like fucking

4040
02:58:59,630 --> 02:59:04,630
earth.
Nick Diaz in his prime would land a lot 

4041
02:59:04,630 --> 02:59:05,420
of like 50 percent punches.
It was just kinda like punched your face

4042
02:59:05,570 --> 02:59:08,270
until you got hurt.
And then he would start digging hard.

4043
02:59:08,300 --> 02:59:09,230
Boom,
boom,

4044
02:59:09,260 --> 02:59:10,810
boom.
That's Kinda like gravity.

4045
02:59:11,140 --> 02:59:16,140
Gravity is just slowly chipping away.
Discuss this idea,

4046
02:59:17,270 --> 02:59:19,290
your posture,
your hips wider,

4047
02:59:19,390 --> 02:59:24,390
your feet hurt.
Gravity bitch a suck your fucking mad at

4048
02:59:25,080 --> 02:59:29,080
Tara's job.

4049
02:59:31,150 --> 02:59:33,160
Gotcha.

4050
02:59:33,270 --> 02:59:36,240
Dat Dat,
Dat,

4051
02:59:36,300 --> 02:59:41,300
Dat da Da da Da.

4052
02:59:48,560 --> 02:59:50,270
And on that note,
ladies and gentlemen,

4053
02:59:50,300 --> 02:59:55,300
that is the end of this podcast.
