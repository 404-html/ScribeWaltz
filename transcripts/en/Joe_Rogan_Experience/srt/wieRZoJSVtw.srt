1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,530
That's very cool.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,590
Three,
two,

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,000
one.
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:12,001
A guy named was his online twitter or
instagram handles tgt studios and he

5
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:16,810
makes these.
I actually had one made for Elon.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,650
Elon Musk loved it too,
so we made him one when he made one with

7
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:24,280
like this very beautiful redwood and
those are one of those things.

8
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:26,440
May Not have jamie the some diodes or
something.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,390
Nixey tubes.
Tubes.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,690
The old.
Yeah.

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,370
Yeah.
He has to get them from Russia.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,790
That's a.
He has them delivered over from Russia.

13
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,250
So they might have like listening
devices implanted in the most.

14
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:41,860
Well,
so Brian,

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,873
good to see you,
man.

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,260
Great to be back.
Yeah.

17
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:46,360
Great to have you back.
So tell me about this tour that you're

18
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:47,640
doing.
It's a,

19
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,650
it's a world.
Try to keep this soccer like a fist.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,690
There you go.
How's that?

21
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,090
That perfect.
Yeah.

22
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,600
So we'll tour starts next week

23
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,820
and I'm the UK and then we go everywhere
from the South Island in New Zealand all

24
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:03,220
the way to the Arctic circle to
Svalbard,

25
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:06,190
which is North,
the furthest north that you can go on a

26
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:10,180
commercial aircraft in the middle of
where in the states for a month in a

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,670
mainly may and uh,
yeah,

28
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:16,630
it's,
it's about cosmology and about the

29
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:19,790
questions that cosmology raises.
So Abo,

30
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,890
interested in the science of how did the
universe begin,

31
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,790
even questions of what may have been
there is a universal eternal.

32
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,890
Is there such a thing as before the big
bang.

33
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,130
What is the future of the universe?
How does complexity emerge spontaneously

34
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,410
in a universe.
And then we sort of take it for granted

35
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:41,170
that we,
there's a big bang and it's all heart

36
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:43,870
and there's just this kind of hot glow
of stuff.

37
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,460
And I altered that spontaneously in 13
point 8 billion years.

38
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:52,060
You get something like the earth with
the civilization and life on it.

39
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,970
So how does that,
do we know anything about that?

40
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:55,490
I mean,
we do.

41
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,940
I'm asking the question rhetorically.
We know quite a lot about it,

42
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,120
so it's,
it's really about showing the size and

43
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,210
scale of the universe,
but addressing those questions I think

44
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,850
everybody has about what is it,
what does it mean to be human?

45
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:11,851
This tiny little finite life that we
lead in a possibly infinite universe.

46
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:13,600
How do you make sense of that?

47
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,460
Well,
it's incredibly exciting to me that

48
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:21,110
there's a giant audience for this and
that what Neil degrasse Tyson had been

49
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:24,920
doing and what a lot of public touring
intellectuals are doing now,

50
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,580
they're doing these giant theaters and
these people are coming out to see these

51
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,300
shows and we're realizing that there's.
I mean,

52
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,220
I hate to use the term market for this,
but there's a demand for this and

53
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:38,390
there's a lot of people who are
incredibly fascinated by this and it's

54
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,910
spreading information and spreading
knowledge.

55
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,520
Yeah.
I mean in the UK particularly,

56
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,440
I've been to Wembley arena.
For example,

57
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,660
you know,
you're talking about 10,000 people,

58
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:50,120
12,000 people in the shows and you're
right,

59
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:52,490
they are coming.
I'll the big shows,

60
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:57,150
spectacular screens and all that.
They're coming full to think that they

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,220
come into here about what we know

62
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,580
about the universe and nature and I
think,

63
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,630
you know,
I think I'm not surprised people are

64
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,880
interested because these are questions
that everybody asks.

65
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,340
You don't to just why am I here?
You know,

66
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,060
everybody's sat there asking that
question,

67
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,620
but I,
my point is that there is a framework,

68
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,440
there's a framework of knowledge,
there are things we know about the

69
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:19,960
universe,
so it is true that science scientists

70
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:22,510
are not going to tell you why you're
here and you're not to say what the

71
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:25,350
meaning of life is,
but there is actually a,

72
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,350
there are things you need to know if you
want to start to explore those questions

73
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:33,760
for yourself.
You need to know that there are 2

74
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,590
trillion galaxies in the observable
universe.

75
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,130
You need to know the Milky Way Galaxy
has got 200 billion stars.

76
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,460
Most of those stars now we know have
planetary systems.

77
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,080
We estimate there are something like 20
billion earth like planets or

78
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:50,620
potentially earth like planets in the
Milky Way galaxy alone.

79
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,250
So if you're asking questions about what
is my place in the universe,

80
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,500
you need to know those things.
First of all,

81
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:59,890
it's a framework within which you can
think when you get to those numbers,

82
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:03,400
when you're talking about trillions and
billions and all those zeros,

83
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,950
my brain just goes numb.
I,

84
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:10,240
there's this lack of comprehension that
I'm well aware of.

85
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,130
Like those numbers get thrown about.
I go,

86
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,640
oh,
$200 million now.

87
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,140
And I think everybody does.
I think every scientist that no

88
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:24,400
scientist can picture that number.
I mean he even the small number $200

89
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:28,060
billion,
the number of stars in one galaxy.

90
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,780
And then when you say 2 trillion
galaxies,

91
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,740
you know that that's.
I challenge anyone to be able to picture

92
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,350
that.
But it is the reality that we've

93
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,700
observed.
We've,

94
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,590
you know,
we,

95
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,030
I mean we haven't counted all 2 trillion
by the way we have.

96
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,340
We have a thing called the Sloan digital
sky survey,

97
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:48,430
which maps the positions of galaxies.
So you can,

98
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,990
you know,
how much should the sky you surveyed and

99
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:54,580
you know how many galaxies you've
counted and then you can spread that

100
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,260
across the wider universe and you get
this picture of a vast and possibly

101
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,820
infinite universe meet.
We,

102
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,050
we know that the universe or very
strongly suspect that the university is

103
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:09,610
much bigger than the piece we can see.
So we have good reason to think that's

104
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,890
the case.
Whether it's infinite or not is another

105
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:13,300
question.
And then that goes to your,

106
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,450
you know that.
Can you picture infinity while no one

107
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:19,560
can picture infinity?
This is a weird thing as well about,

108
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,691
you know,
we,

109
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:23,320
we say the universe began 13 point 8
billion years ago.

110
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,250
So that's a measurement.
So because we can measure the speed that

111
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:29,920
all the galaxies are flying away from us
essentially.

112
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,890
And then you can run time backwards if
you like.

113
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,110
So to find out when they were all on top
of each other.

114
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,480
And so it's quite a simple measurement
and we've done that.

115
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,690
So we say the universe began 13 point 8
billion years ago,

116
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,440
but actually all we know really was the
universe was very hot and very dense at

117
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:48,040
that time and we have some theories that
the universe was in existence before

118
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:52,210
that and perhaps some sort of
circumstantial evidence and that means

119
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:55,810
that actually the universe could,
could have always been their eternal.

120
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,070
And um,
when,

121
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,970
when I tell it to people sometimes they
get a bit,

122
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,450
some people got upset about that.
Some people would rather it had a

123
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,390
beginning.
The idea that it might have been around

124
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:09,740
forever is more frightening somehow.
Then the fact that it began.

125
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,680
It's,
it's interesting the way people's minds

126
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,220
work.
What terrifies you the most and eternal

127
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:18,290
universe or a finite universe?

128
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,181
Yeah.
Other,

129
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:23,050
both incomprehensible.
The eternal universe.

130
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,000
W,
W,

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,900
W,
if there was an eternal universe,

132
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:30,040
is that negate the theory of the big
bang or does it mean that there's a

133
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:35,041
constant cycle of big bangs and then
expansion and then recompression or

134
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,210
could do say those theories that are
back in vogue.

135
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:42,160
Some of those theories are back in vogue
again.

136
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,400
So yes,
some of them say that there's a cycling

137
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:46,600
universe,
um,

138
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:51,250
so the big bang is an event when space
gets very hot and very dense and filled

139
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:54,100
with particles.
And that may happen again,

140
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,910
are some of the other theories.
Uh,

141
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,760
there's a theory called eternal
inflation,

142
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,090
which is a theory that,
and it's actually the most popular

143
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:02,410
theory,
I think at the moment,

144
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,170
but what happened,
but why the big bang is the way that it

145
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:07,900
is who's got some very special features,
the Big Bang,

146
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:11,590
which we could talk about,
but inflation is the idea that space

147
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,240
space time was around before the big
bang and it was expanding extremely fast

148
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,840
and there was doubling in size in the
most popular of these theories.

149
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,530
Every 10 to the minus 37 seconds,
which is point naught,

150
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:23,911
naught,
naught,

151
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:24,371
naught,
naught,

152
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:26,710
naught with 37 knots,
one of a second.

153
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,240
So he's an imaginably fast expansion.
And then the idea is that draws to a

154
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:34,330
close,
so quite naturally sort of dies away and

155
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:38,800
the expansion slows down and all the
energy that was taken there was causing

156
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:41,110
that expansions sort of gets dumped into
space.

157
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:45,010
And heats it up and makes particles and
that's what we call the big bank and

158
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:50,011
those theories that slight extension to
those and say that that that slowing

159
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:54,310
down just happens in little patches.
So most of the universe,

160
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:59,110
the overwhelming majority of the
university still inflating that insane

161
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,450
sort of speed and they're just little
patches stop and they are big banks.

162
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,930
So you get multiple universities,
a multiverse,

163
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,860
it's called the inflationary multiverse
and we are in one of those bubbles and

164
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:15,160
that's one of the more popular theories.
Dad's another one.

165
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,450
I mean that right now,

166
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,290
aware of what you're saying.
I,

167
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,650
I can,
I can sort of visualize it in some sort

168
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:26,100
of a graphic form,
but it's incomprehensible like my mind

169
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:29,790
doesn't.
It doesn't have the capacity to expand

170
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,500
the,
the sense of distance and size to that,

171
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,050
that grass is this because of just the
way we evolved.

172
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,850
We evolved here on earth to deal with
the space.

173
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:44,851
It's in front of us and now over the
course of an industrial civilization and

174
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,570
education,
we are now grasping these concepts that

175
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:53,571
are so alien to the reality,
the tangible reality that we exist in

176
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,070
every day.
I'm sure that's

177
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,510
right.
And the,

178
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,680
the,
you know,

179
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,620
even very simple things like you go back
to the Greeks.

180
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,720
So Aristotle and the great,
you know,

181
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,360
very clever people,
but they thought the earth was the

182
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:08,230
center of the universe.
Why?

183
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,190
Because it feels like it's at the
central is it feels like we're not

184
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,590
moving.
Um,

185
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,240
and that's quite a deep point actually
in physics.

186
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:19,830
It's like why is it that we're flying
around relative to the sun very fast at

187
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:22,380
whatever speed is 18 miles a second or
something like that.

188
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,800
And the whole solar system is going
around the Milky Way Galaxy and so on.

189
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,270
Why is it that we don't feel it?
And then the Greeks quite naturally

190
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:30,541
said,
well,

191
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,920
because we're at the center of the
universe,

192
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,410
they also said everything falls to the
earth.

193
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,650
So therefore the earth has to be at the
center is natural.

194
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,430
And,
and actually it's quite a deep a

195
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,280
thought,
so to understand why it doesn't feel

196
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,890
that we're moving,
you have to go all the way to Einstein

197
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:49,560
really for someone to take that very
seriously.

198
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,600
And he why he said actually he said,
well,

199
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,330
this,
um,

200
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,150
there's a great little explanation in
Stephen Hawking's brief history of time

201
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:59,340
about this,
that the idea that you can't tell

202
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:03,300
whether you're moving or not demolishes
the notion of absolute space.

203
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,260
So if we think about space space to you
or most people,

204
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:10,920
I suppose you'd think it the way that
Newton didn't have a big box within

205
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,760
which things happen.
And that's got to be,

206
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,360
that's a natural picture of space and
the universe isn't,

207
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:18,690
it isn't a thing in which all the
planets and galaxies are placed.

208
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,070
But,
um,

209
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,140
in,
in the brief history of time harking

210
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:22,501
says,
well,

211
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:25,050
imagine bouncing a ball.
So he bends a bowl at the table,

212
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:27,900
now a tennis ball.
So I drop it and I catch it again.

213
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,300
Um,
so let's say I drop it and it takes a

214
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:31,380
second to bands up.

215
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,000
So in that second,
the earth has moved about 80 miles or so

216
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,390
in space around the sun.
So you could ask the question,

217
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,810
did that ball returned to the same place
in space or not?

218
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,580
And the answer is you can't answer it
you.

219
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,710
It does from our perspective.
But from the perspective of someone

220
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:51,360
watching the earth go all the way
around,

221
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,460
the sudden it went up,
I caught it again.

222
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:56,940
It had moved 18 miles and then from some
other perspective it would have been

223
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:00,180
something else.
So the point is you can't say this is a

224
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:03,990
point in space,
it came back to the same place because

225
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,750
that just depends on your perspective.
Depends on whether he watching the

226
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,540
sudden the earth around the sun or
whatever it is.

227
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,910
So.
So Einstein said that means there's no

228
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:16,590
such thing as absolute space,
which is kind of follows if you think

229
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:17,424
about it.

230
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,000
But that's a difficult.
It's,

231
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,810
it's cool.
Put difficult thought process,

232
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,960
right?
I mean that's,

233
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,170
that's essentially what's happening when
you're on a plane.

234
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,700
I mean,
if you're throwing a ball up in the air

235
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:29,160
and catching it on the planes,
having another much smaller scale,

236
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:29,994
right?
Yeah.

237
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,160
I mean you're flying at whatever,
600 miles an hour relative to grand,

238
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,460
but when you're sitting there,
yeah,

239
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,070
and Einstein elevated that to a
principal and said,

240
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,730
if you're moving it but it'd be not
accelerated and you just moving at a

241
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:45,660
constant speed in a plane or now.
I mean that's essentially what we're

242
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:46,111
doing.
Now.

243
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:49,050
We're moving around the sun that
effectively constant speed.

244
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,100
Then you can't tell,
so there's no experiment you can do.

245
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,170
We could look at the decay of
radioactive nuclear,

246
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:59,770
saw some electricity and magnetism or
Banzel have a pendulum,

247
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:02,590
whatever it is,
and there's no experiment you can do to

248
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:03,760
tell you whether you're moving or not.

249
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,740
Therefore,
that concept has no meaning because you

250
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:12,940
can't measure it
and that that's led Einstein to

251
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,870
relativity so that that's the basis of
general relativity,

252
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:19,030
which is our best theory of the
universe,

253
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,410
don't.
Why is it that we think that the known

254
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:26,140
universe is larger than what we can
observe?

255
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,430
Well,
one point is that it's an expanding and

256
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,530
we always see the same radiation out
there,

257
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,760
so the glow of the big bang,
but there is some deeper reasons.

258
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:44,790
Um,
the one from the theory of inflation,

259
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,660
the,
the,

260
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,710
the,
the best way to explain the universe,

261
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:55,420
the properties that we see is that it's
very much bigger than the piece we can

262
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:56,440
see.
So for example,

263
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,980
we measure space to be what's called
flat.

264
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,080
I don't even have to say what's called
flattery is flat.

265
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,760
So if you imagine slices of space,
let's imagine slicer to them at

266
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:07,780
different times.

267
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,510
So,
so you just sliced the universe and say

268
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,840
there's a big sheets like this,
like a tesla sheet of space and there's

269
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,790
another sheet and another sheet.
And it can,

270
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,050
it can have a geometry,
right?

271
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:20,170
It can be flat,
like a table top or it could be curved

272
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,530
like a sphere or it could be curved in
the opposite direction,

273
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:26,740
sort of like a saddle or a bowl.
And we can measure that.

274
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,260
And when we measure it,
we see it,

275
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:33,261
it's absolutely flat and that's a very
unusual thing for it to be like,

276
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,510
um,
it requires because what Einstein's

277
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:41,680
theory says is that the shape of space
that the curvature of space and

278
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:43,910
determined by the stuff that's in it,
that's,

279
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,650
that's basically Einstein's theory of
general relativity put stuff into space

280
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:51,160
and it curves it and bends it in warp
and stretches it and so on.

281
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,330
And what we find is that with this
precisely the right amount of stuff in

282
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:59,080
the universe to have a completely flat
universe.

283
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,001
And the,
the,

284
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:02,540
the explanation,
the most favored explanation for that is

285
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,810
university is way bigger than the piece
we can see.

286
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,670
And so it's like looking at a piece of
the earth.

287
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,450
Are you looking at little one Mile
Square of the earth?

288
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,320
Right?
Then it's,

289
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,010
it is flat,
right?

290
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,230
You have to look at big distances.
It's kind of avoided the radius of the

291
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,670
earth or you know,
bigger,

292
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,850
bigger than one kilometer anyway,
on one mile to see the.

293
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:25,930
Actually you're on a curved surface.
And that's one of the ideas about the

294
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,660
universe.
And white appears to be the way that it

295
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,520
is because it's way,
way bigger.

296
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,180
So we were just looking at a little
piece and that's why it looks flat.

297
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,420
And that's one of the ideas.

298
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,780
Now when you say flat like that,
my brain doesn't understand this because

299
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,610
from our perspective,
when you look up at the Milky Way,

300
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:48,070
you see all these stars all over the
place.

301
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,090
So if you're saying flat like a what,
how much height and what,

302
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,400
what are you saying?
So terms of like the way to measure it,

303
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,150
the best way to think about it is not to
think of three dimensions of space

304
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,620
because then we can't picture it.
But you can think of to like this table

305
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:04,280
top.
And that's all right.

306
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:07,730
We just forget the other one for now.
And so you know what flat is on this

307
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:09,500
table?
I mean you could define it.

308
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,010
So you could say for example,
that if I draw a triangle on the top of

309
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,650
the table,
then all the angles add up to 180

310
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:18,680
degrees.
So that actually defines flat.

311
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,500
If you did that on the surface of the
earth with the big triangle,

312
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,600
then the angles wouldn't adopt 280
degrees and all.

313
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,000
You could draw a circle and say what's
Pi?

314
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,790
So Pi is the ratio of the circumference
of a circle to its diameter.

315
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,160
That's only true on a flat surface is
different if the surface is curved.

316
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,100
So you can define flatness,
so when you.

317
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,800
But when you're saying flatness,
how,

318
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:44,180
what is the height and what is the
width?

319
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,000
Like if you're talking about it as if
it's a table,

320
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:49,310
there must be some sort of A.
There's a dimension to it,

321
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,270
correct?
Oh yeah.

322
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,320
There's a third dimension of space,
but the same applies.

323
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:58,600
It's just a generalization of geometry.
Then say you can pick fights.

324
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,160
We can picture it in two dimensions,
but you can.

325
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,890
You can draw.
You can quite literally,

326
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:07,460
you could imagine sending light beams
out and we do this measurement.

327
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:11,720
Actually we can look at the disc.
The most distant light we can see,

328
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,500
which is something called the cosmic
microwave background radiation,

329
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,840
which is if you imagine looking out,
if you look at the Andromeda Galaxy,

330
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,940
which we can see with the naked eye here
in la,

331
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,370
you can see that,
so the most distant object you can see

332
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:29,510
with the naked eye and it's about two,
2 million light years away or so,

333
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,390
which means the light took 2 million
years to get to us.

334
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,610
So it's a long way away,
but it's very big.

335
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,740
So it as you look further out into the
universe to more and more distant

336
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:41,660
galaxies,
you're looking further back in time

337
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,630
because you look at something that's a
billion light years away.

338
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:46,520
Then the light took a billion years to
get to us.

339
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,330
So you see it as it was a billion years
in the past and we can actually look so

340
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:55,331
far out that we can see almost back to
13 point 8 billion years ago,

341
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,620
which is very close to the big bank.
So we can look to light.

342
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:04,730
That began its journey before they were
galaxies and that's the the oldest light

343
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:05,750
in the universe.
Which is,

344
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:07,040
by the way,
one of the,

345
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,860
one of the pieces of evidence from
people say,

346
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,640
I don't believe in the big bank.
The answer is,

347
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:11,474
well,
you can see it.

348
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,030
Sorry,
I just dare,

349
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,120
you can see it.

350
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,150
We have pictures of it and that light,
it turns out that there are such

351
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,880
structures are ripples in that light,
um,

352
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,620
which we can use as a ruler.
So quite literally as a ruler on the

353
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:29,810
sky.
And then because that light has been

354
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:32,450
traveling through the universe,
we can see how that rule has been

355
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,110
distorted as,
as the lightest traveled through space.

356
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:41,430
And so we can infer where the space is
flat or curved or how it's warped,

357
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,090
if you like.
Just from that measurement is the

358
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:46,700
beautiful measurement.
Is it possible that in the future we'll

359
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:49,350
be able to see past 13 point 8 billion
years?

360
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,060
Not with light,
not because.

361
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,690
Well,
the picture is that before it's actually

362
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,410
released 300,
80,000 years after the big bang.

363
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,700
It's a very precise number.
You might say.

364
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:01,050
How do you know that?
Well,

365
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,390
before that time,
the universe was so hot,

366
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,470
the atoms couldn't form,
so you had a soup of electrically

367
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:11,250
charged particles if just too hot for
electrons to go into orbit around

368
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,370
Nuclei,
so the universe was opaque to light,

369
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,390
so you just couldn't.

370
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,540
It was like one,
almost like a big glowing star if you

371
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,130
like,
and then when it was expanding,

372
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:25,410
it cooled past the point where the atoms
could form and at that point it becomes

373
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:30,411
transparent really almost instantly and
it cosmic time scale and so the light

374
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:34,410
could then travel in straight lines
through the universe and we can see that

375
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:37,260
light so we see the light from that
time,

376
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,350
but further back than that,
it's opaque.

377
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,000
So you can't see past that with light,
but you can potentially with

378
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:49,410
gravitational waves,
which is this measurement that got the

379
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,200
Nobel prize a couple of years ago.
The ligo experiment here in the United

380
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,160
States and that seat looks for ripples
in the fabric of space and time.

381
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,420
And in principle,
if we had a big enough detector,

382
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,500
you could see the ripples from the big
bang.

383
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,870
So you could.
If you could take an image of the big

384
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:07,050
bang in gravitational waves,
which will be,

385
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,550
but you need an enormous space based
detector that we're not gonna build

386
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,540
anytime soon.

387
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,150
No,
obviously this is all through equipment

388
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:18,660
and technology that's been invented over
the last few hundred years and

389
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,510
perfected.
Is it possible that things could get

390
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:26,511
better and you could get some some
ability to detect things even in a far

391
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,650
more distant way?
Yeah.

392
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:31,500
I mean the gravitational waves are
incredible.

393
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:36,501
I mean Einstein predicted them in 1915.
Never thought they'd be detected because

394
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:39,810
you need such a high unit.
Lasers for didn't have lasers,

395
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,070
but they think Lygo this experiment,
which is half in a near Seattle in

396
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:48,540
Washington state and half in Louisiana,
so they've got two detectors and they're

397
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:53,541
basically sort of a a no three mile long
laser beams and that just sit and

398
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:59,880
measure this of stretching and squashing
of space as the ripples in the fabric of

399
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:03,180
the universe to go through and what
they've been observing.

400
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,200
Collisions of black holes,
so you can imagine how extreme a

401
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,900
colliding black holes.

402
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,370
He said incredibly extreme event,
so it shakes the fabric of the universe

403
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,820
and the referrals come across the
universe and these laser beams,

404
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:19,920
we should just basically,
rulers can detect it.

405
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,810
They just sort of ring,
just vibrate as the referrals go through

406
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,480
in space and time.
That kip Thorne,

407
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:31,890
he got the Nobel prize last year for.
This is one of the greatest living

408
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,520
physicists I was signed.
Describe it as a storm in time,

409
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,420
so you've got this time to storm.
It's a beautiful image.

410
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,700
So that technology is incredible because
the change in length is that kind of

411
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,110
been the exact number,
but it's way,

412
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,610
way,
way less than the diameter of an atomic

413
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:51,730
nucleus.
So the change in length of the beams.

414
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,820
It's tiny measurement,
but we can do it.

415
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,040
So this collision of black holes,
the idea that you can detect that?

416
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,950
Yeah,
that.

417
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,930
Yeah,
they did.

418
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,550
I said the paper,
the first paper they published that two

419
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:11,551
black holes and they were about 30 times
the mass of the sun each and they're all

420
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:16,651
beside each other and spiraling in
towards each other and they accelerated.

421
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,720
At one point.
They were approaching each other at one

422
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,690
third,
the speed of light and the accelerated

423
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:25,540
to two thirds,
the speed of light in a 10th of a second

424
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,590
and now hit each other and the
explosion,

425
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,750
the energy release was,
I think I'm right,

426
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:36,751
it was something like 50 times the
energy release that the power of all the

427
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:41,971
stars in the observable universe glowing
and it was something like 50 times and

428
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,370
that of energy for a tiny fraction of a
second,

429
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,690
but it's,
it's an unimaginably violent event and

430
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:54,691
that's why our detectors can see the
ripples that that makes in space and

431
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:57,400
time.
And we detected kind of it's two or

432
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:00,610
three of them now and also two neutron
stars colliding.

433
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:04,000
We saw that as well with it.
So it's an incredible machine,

434
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:08,320
which is why he got the Nobel prize.
Now there's a supermassive black hole.

435
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,400
The center of every galaxy.
Yeah.

436
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,620
There is also other black holes that
aren't necessarily in the center of

437
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:16,780
galaxies.
So these little ones were little,

438
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,750
a few times the mass of the sun and
they're from collapsed hours.

439
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,970
So they are stars at the end of their
life.

440
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,750
Very bigness and more massive than the
sun,

441
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,660
but they run out of their fuel and they
start to collapse because gravity

442
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:34,870
squashes them and if they're
sufficiently massive,

443
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,120
then there's nothing that can stop the
collapse and so they collapse as far as

444
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:41,890
we know to a point,
right?

445
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,160
Essentially an infinitely dense point.
We don't really know what happens that

446
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,580
we don't know what happened right in the
middle,

447
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,710
but they collapsed to such an extent
that there's a region around it where

448
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,140
from which light contest game and that's
a so nothing can escape and that that's

449
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:02,860
a black hole.
And what happens to them?

450
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,950
Do they travel?
They moving through space?

451
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,240
Yeah,
they'll still stars.

452
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,210
So they're still there.
They're surrounded this region,

453
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,780
wherever you fall in,
it's called the event horizon and if you

454
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:20,200
go across that horizon,
then you are going to the center.

455
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,510
There's one way of thinking about it,
which is quite cool.

456
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:27,370
Which is that at the time and space sort
of flip is one way to think about it.

457
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,460
So in the same way that we are going
into the future now,

458
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,410
so.
So we're going to tomorrow.

459
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,900
There's nothing we can do about it.
We are going to tomorrow.

460
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,980
I'm in the same way.
If you fall in cross the event horizon

461
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:41,410
of a black hole,
you are going to the middle,

462
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,820
the singularity,
it's called,

463
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,530
so that's,
that's your future.

464
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,380
Every.
Every line of your future points to the

465
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:52,580
center of the black hole.
So it's kind of the ultimate of no

466
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,170
escape for the ultimate prison.

467
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,390
You're going to get squashed to an
infinitely dense.

468
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,840
So point not every star becomes a black
hole at the end of its life now because

469
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,630
if,
if I'm sensing light the sun and we have

470
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:07,340
a small stock,
it's quite small.

471
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:09,080
Yeah,
and when it collapses,

472
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,760
there's A.
There's a sort of a pressure force if

473
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:17,070
you like,
which is caused by the fact the

474
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:19,970
electrons don't like to be very close to
each other,

475
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,580
so it's called the Paleo exclusion
principle,

476
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,140
but essentially what happens is that
says they get squashed closer and closer

477
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:30,080
together.
They move faster and faster to get out

478
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:33,830
of each of this way if you like.
And that makes a force which holds them

479
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:36,590
up.
And so that creates what's called a

480
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:39,950
white dwarf star,
so you can have a blob of Matzoh.

481
00:24:39,951 --> 00:24:43,130
They're about the size of the earth,
but they're about the mass of the sun.

482
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,510
And uh,
so that's,

483
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:47,630
that's for smaller stars.
They end up as these white dwarf things

484
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:52,631
which are very dense objects as another
version which is called a neutron star,

485
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,100
which is the same thing,
but for neutrons and they,

486
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:58,580
they move faster and faster.
So if it's,

487
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,000
if it's massive enough that it
overwhelms the electron thing,

488
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,590
then the electrons sort of crush into
protons and turned into neutrons.

489
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,070
And the whole thing starts again.
And so a neutron star can be,

490
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,710
you know,
elite one and a half times the mass of

491
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,544
the sudden,
let's say.

492
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,180
But it can be about what,
10 miles across.

493
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,660
So,
so that's an incredibly dense ball of

494
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:24,140
matter held up by this neutrons moving
around.

495
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,780
It's got a fancy name,
it's called Neutron degeneracy pressure

496
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,800
with it.
But if you go even bigger than even that

497
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:32,840
can't hold it up.
And as far as we know them,

498
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:35,600
there's no known force that we know of
that can hold,

499
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,150
hold the thing up if it's too massive.

500
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,030
And so that's when it just almost winks
out of existence.

501
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:43,310
If you like it,
it collapses and collapses and

502
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:44,450
collapses.
And,

503
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,600
and that's when you get a black hole.
We try to put that into perspective of

504
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:50,030
the earth.
The Sun is a million times bigger than

505
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:53,120
the earth in this.
This neutron star is,

506
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,890
would you say one and a half times the
mass of the 10 miles wide?

507
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:58,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

508
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,070
So,
and there's loads of those around them.

509
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,910
They're called sales.
So we see those all over the place

510
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,590
there.
The first one that was discovered was

511
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:09,950
called LGM one because they're spinning
very fast.

512
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,890
And then the,
it was called lgm one because it's a

513
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:15,200
very irregular pulse and they thought it
was a little green men.

514
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,350
So they called it kind of jokingly
little green men one.

515
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,930
And um,
so yeah,

516
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,730
we,
we've seen that there's one called the

517
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:24,890
crab pulsar,
which is in the crab Nebula,

518
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,620
which we saw the supernova explosion.

519
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,740
So that's when a lot of the styles
explodes at the end of its life and then

520
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:35,680
collapses to form a neutron star.
And we saw that in 10:54 add,

521
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,490
wasn't there some speculation that our
gout or our solar system at one point

522
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,370
was,
had,

523
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,380
it was a binary star system and that one
of those stars had become a door.

524
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,890
I don't know.
Um,

525
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,360
some,
someone had said something about that in

526
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:58,290
relationship to the dense object they
believe is outside the Kuyper belt.

527
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,590
Yeah.
I mean there's some evidence that the

528
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,460
bits of evidence that there's something
out there.

529
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:03,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

530
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,480
And could,
because of the periodic extinctions and

531
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:09,470
things on earth,
you get periodic bombardments from in

532
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:10,590
the belt.
So yeah,

533
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,050
I think one of the theories,
histrionic extinctions.

534
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,411
Well,
yeah,

535
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:15,000
so figuring out like the,
you know,

536
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,610
they've been.
There had been mass extinctions on earth

537
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,730
when a lot of the life died and then we
don't know what caused all those.

538
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,130
But um,
sometimes there are impacts from space

539
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,530
that seems clear.
And so yeah,

540
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:31,980
there are theories that there's
something over tonight which can disrupt

541
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:36,090
all these objects are in the pipe,
the belt that sends low to comets and

542
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,920
asteroids inwards to the inner solar
system and can cause a habit.

543
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,730
And so there's some people look at those
theories.

544
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,513
I mean,
I don't know,

545
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,220
it's one of those,
it is a possibility that the same as the

546
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:53,800
circulation was,
that there's something out there is the,

547
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,610
correct me if I'm wrong,
something called the galactic shelf like

548
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:59,850
that it gets to a certain space and it
indicates that there's something far

549
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:01,940
larger out there.
Uh,

550
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,600
yeah.
I mean I think,

551
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,970
I don't know the exact about the stellar
sized or mass objects out there.

552
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:11,800
I don't know that.
I mean there is some sort of

553
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,560
suggestions.
Is another planet out there,

554
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,570
big planet for example.

555
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,320
But you're right,
there can be the be stuff in way beyond

556
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:21,360
the bell and we talk in,
you know,

557
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:23,280
a light year away or something like
that.

558
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:27,240
Now it's interesting because it's
incomprehensible the distance,

559
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:29,310
right?
And in our minds how far that must be

560
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:34,311
out past what we used to call Pluto,
but for whatever reason that becomes

561
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,780
more interesting because it's in our
neighborhood.

562
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:42,410
Whereas if they find some distant star
system and that it might have a planet

563
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,830
similar to Earth,
that doesn't seem as compelling for

564
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:48,780
whatever weird reason now.
Yeah,

565
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:52,850
I mean,
I think the planets around Alpha Centuri

566
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,140
approximate Centura,
which is the closest stars.

567
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,660
It seems like there are planets around
those now.

568
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,820
And then that,
that was interesting because we could

569
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,550
conceive of go in there and there was
this idea,

570
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,060
you're Stephen Hawking actually and some
others at before he died,

571
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:08,400
had this idea called breakthrough
starshot,

572
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:12,930
which is the idea to send a little probe
out to at the center at the Alpha

573
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,763
Centura system.

574
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,380
And it,
I think in their view,

575
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,050
Yuri milner as well,
the,

576
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:18,880
the,
you know,

577
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,610
the,
the entrepreneur wanting to do that.

578
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,050
And uh,
the,

579
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,350
I think he said something like a hundred
years traveled time or something with,

580
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:27,090
with the,
with our current technology.

581
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,000
And they pointed out that we don't do
that now.

582
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,920
We don't think a hundred years in the
future,

583
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,500
but if you go back when people were
building cathedrals,

584
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:39,240
people used to routinely start projects
that would take a hundred years to bear

585
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,090
fruit and so we imagine going there and
that's.

586
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:46,330
That then becomes fascinating I think
because then you've got a solar system

587
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,620
and know the solar system that you could
go and visit conceivably.

588
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,720
Conceivably.

589
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,620
Yeah.
I mean what kind of speed are we talking

590
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,470
and how long would it take to get there?
Well,

591
00:29:57,471 --> 00:29:57,861
yeah,
I mean,

592
00:29:57,861 --> 00:29:59,360
so it is.
I think the,

593
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,330
the idea was about 100 years to get
there,

594
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,380
so it's going four light years or so in
100 years or whatever that you would

595
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,850
have to essentially do what they didn't
like the Ridley Scott Alien Film and put

596
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,640
people into some sort of a,
Oh,

597
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:14,420
you're a robotic probe.
It wouldn't be a.

598
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,130
It wouldn't be possible for a crew.
Well it is,

599
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,420
but you have to freeze them.
Yeah.

600
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:22,550
That's always the.
When you touch your engineer's,

601
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:24,890
you had Ilan and didn't use engineers
always say,

602
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,061
you know,
physicists go,

603
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:27,140
well,
it's possible in principle,

604
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:30,740
so over to you,
you do it now there are no laws of

605
00:30:30,741 --> 00:30:32,960
physics that tells us we can't do it,
so we just do it.

606
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,550
But you know,
that's a weird relationship with

607
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,200
physics.

608
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,700
Physicists and engineers.
Yeah,

609
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,810
yeah,
yeah.

610
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,501
But,
but yeah,

611
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:42,550
in principle you're right.
If you can send a little robots facial

612
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,630
there,
you can send a crude spaceship.

613
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:50,090
I'm of the opinion as time goes on and
augmented and virtual reality gets

614
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:55,361
better and better that it doesn't
totally make sense unless we're talking

615
00:30:55,821 --> 00:31:00,290
about colonizing someplace to send
biological life to another planet and if

616
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,450
we can send some probe that doesn't have
to worry about the,

617
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,890
you know,
the biology being affected by radiation

618
00:31:06,891 --> 00:31:09,440
or by the speed of travel or even buy
food,

619
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:14,650
we can send something out there and
almost be there by virtue of goggles,

620
00:31:16,881 --> 00:31:19,160
virtual reality goggles or something
else.

621
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,370
Yeah.
You hear that in science at the moment.

622
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:25,410
Space Science.
We have this debate alive actually

623
00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:28,440
because of course I'm space probes like
curiosity.

624
00:31:28,441 --> 00:31:32,820
That's on Mars at the moment.
That's really cheap compared to sending

625
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:36,600
people to Mars,
and so quite often the scientists who

626
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:38,370
wants to find out about the world's will
say,

627
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:39,720
well,
we should spend it on robots.

628
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:44,930
We shouldn't spend it on people.
I think crewed space exploration is in

629
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,550
some ways,
I mean it's clearly true at the moment

630
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:52,190
that humans can do more than robots so
we can explore the place better for an

631
00:31:52,191 --> 00:31:53,100
now.
Yeah,

632
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,350
but.
But I think it has to be.

633
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,380
It's about something else.
I mean it's about.

634
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,780
It's not only,
it's about living and working off the

635
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:06,720
planet,
which I think is quite persuasive

636
00:32:06,721 --> 00:32:07,471
argument.
Actually.

637
00:32:07,471 --> 00:32:09,900
We've.
We've already industrialized near Earth

638
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:12,600
orbit,
so it's already a multibillion dollar

639
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:14,910
industry in every communication
satellites and weather satellites,

640
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:15,810
gps,
whatever.

641
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,330
Yeah.
We're already up there and so learning

642
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:22,770
to live and work in space is I think a
natural extension of our,

643
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,830
of our civilization.
Plus the fact he taught,

644
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:29,640
so Elon or Jeff Bezos,
they point out that the amount of

645
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:33,600
resources available just slightly above
our heads is vast.

646
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,430
And so I remember I talked to Jeff Bezos
actually once and he,

647
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,640
he thinks really simply and he said
maybe for example,

648
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:42,680
in the asteroid belt,
there's enough metal,

649
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,240
I think to build a skyscraper side,
what is it?

650
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,700
Something like 800 stories tall and
cover the earth in it,

651
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,700
right if you want.
Now we don't want to dig that.

652
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,140
But his point was that the energy from
the sun is all up there.

653
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,590
The resources are up there.
So you could almost imagine trying to

654
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:05,320
zone the earth residential at some point
in the future to protect the planets.

655
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,950
And do you have a industry off the
planet,

656
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,110
for example.
And these sound,

657
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,850
it sounds like science fiction except
that now space x and blue origin,

658
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:17,600
those people have got reusable rockets.
So suddenly the economics become

659
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:19,470
sensible.
So I think it,

660
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,270
I think,
I think expansion is good and I think we

661
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:27,680
will expand and I think we will expand
outwards because there's not much room

662
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:30,410
left on this planet to expand.
So I think we'll do so.

663
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:34,070
But that's a whole different idea.
It's not about gathering scientific

664
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:36,980
information,
it's about a frontier.

665
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,540
And and all the benefits that come from
operating as a civilization on the

666
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:45,710
frontier which we have lost on the earth
because there is no from to your left.

667
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,300
And so I like that idea that Mars.
And when you talk about Mars,

668
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:53,960
especially with Elon He's right?
That that's the only place you can go.

669
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,360
So there,
there is no other planet we can go to

670
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,450
other than Mars.
You can go to Jupiter or Saturn,

671
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,500
mercury or Venus.
So if we want to go somewhere and expand

672
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:06,410
our civilization,
it has to be mild and everything's there

673
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,840
that you need.
So with that,

674
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,190
that's a different thing.
Saying that you want to find out stuff,

675
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,110
you're right.
If we just want to find out stuff,

676
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,220
then you send robots.
But as far as expanding actual

677
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,050
civilization and bring you to another
place,

678
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,020
one of the things that freaked me out as
people get depressed about living in

679
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,810
Seattle,
I mean,

680
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,320
you,
you're going to live on Mars.

681
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:29,830
I wouldn't agree with you.
It'd be a horrendous thing is it's like

682
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:31,530
the.
It'd be like the western front.

683
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,301
Yeah.
It's different here.

684
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:36,330
When people cross the states,
incredibly dangerous thing to do that

685
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,400
when across the states they still got to
Wyoming and beautiful places in Colorado

686
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:41,990
and.

687
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,340
Yeah,
but it was hard.

688
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,720
Yeah.
I wouldn't want it to do it.

689
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:47,150
But once you got there,
there's a river and there's trout in the

690
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:51,740
river and the metals are green and I
agree with you.

691
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:53,510
Right?
I mean I'm not going to go there.

692
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:55,520
So there were vineyards and hotels and
things.

693
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,870
However,
it is true that there are people he

694
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:02,420
liked the challenge and what is true
about Mars?

695
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,750
It's interesting actually because we
know something about the history of

696
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:09,740
miles now quite a lot about the history
of Mars and it's certainly clear that

697
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:13,550
there was water almost certainly oceans,
rivers,

698
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,970
so and that water is almost certainly
still there.

699
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,710
So I would say certainly still there
where they have found large quantities

700
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:22,550
of ice now,
right?

701
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,200
Yeah.
So there's certainly ice.

702
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,520
The may even be pockets of liquid water
below the surface somewhere.

703
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:32,780
So couple that with all the minerals and
the resources that we know are there and

704
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:34,220
you have everything you need.

705
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,400
So that's the thing about Mars,
which is quite nice relative to

706
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:41,820
everywhere else other than the earth.
You can't go to Venus,

707
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,890
you just metal.
What is it?

708
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:49,190
Four hundred and something degrees and
90 atmospheric pressure as I said so,

709
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,940
so,
so Mars is quite nice but I wouldn't go

710
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:55,290
there.
I agree with you because it's not

711
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,600
gravity of Mars in relationship to
third,

712
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,400
third,
I think third,

713
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,091
right?
Yeah,

714
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,760
something like that.
So it would still have a significant

715
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,580
weakening effect.
Like if you went to Mars and then

716
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,670
somehow or another in the future they
were able to get back to earth.

717
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,430
Yeah.
Your body would have a real problem with

718
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:14,100
that.
Right there is there is still grabbing.

719
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,540
It's a bit more than a third.
I can't quite remember,

720
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:16,890
but it's something like that.
But yeah,

721
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,400
so there's still gravity.
So there's gravity,

722
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,000
there's um,
some protection from the that you'd

723
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:27,590
probably want to live in the caves
actually or something like that because

724
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,460
there's no magnetic field there.

725
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,470
So it's quite high radiation
environment,

726
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:34,260
but not too bad.
It was further from the sun than we are.

727
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,560
It's not to the replaces a mouse,
there's a very deep critical helis which

728
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,630
has a big impact basin.
And at the bottom,

729
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,151
the,
the,

730
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:46,170
it's so deep you could fit everest in
it.

731
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,440
So you put Mount Everest in the summit
of Everest,

732
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,410
wouldn't reach the rim of the crater.
So it says something like,

733
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,510
I don't know what it is,
seven miles deep or six miles deep.

734
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:00,030
So you could go there and at the bottom
the atmospheric pressure is so high that

735
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:05,031
you could just about have liquid water
on occasionally on the floor of that

736
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:09,030
crater.
And sometimes it can be 20 degrees.

737
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,020
Really?
Yeah,

738
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:12,360
the Celsius.
Wow.

739
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,620
So,
so better than

740
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,880
experiencing a series called,
right?

741
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,290
Yeah.
So it can be warmer than Minnesota.

742
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,860
And so there are places where it's not
horrendous on Mars.

743
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,510
Uh,
you know,

744
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,880
so the Martian is kind of really stick
in that sense,

745
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,480
sort of bits of it.
Do you watch those movies and shake your

746
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:35,040
head?
I like him.

747
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,980
I like science fiction,
you know,

748
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,640
you know,
so yeah.

749
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:40,440
And I sit there.
I grew up with star wars.

750
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,440
That was my,
when I was nine years old,

751
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:44,030
list and say,
yeah,

752
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,740
I'm not having this.
I didn't,

753
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,130
I did an argument with Neil degrasse
Tyson,

754
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,140
not an argument,
but a debate with him about lightsabers

755
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,690
ones because I claimed that they're
physically the in principle they're

756
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,230
possible.
Um,

757
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,660
and he was trying to say that they
aren't,

758
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,930
but they are,
would,

759
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:03,060
they'd have to loop back around because
the light's not continuing to like the

760
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:05,490
fact that it goes to a certain distance
and pauses.

761
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,800
We'd have to have a mirror or something,
I guess.

762
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:09,240
Yeah.
Something that's pretty be the end of

763
00:38:09,241 --> 00:38:09,511
it.
Right?

764
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:10,470
That's true.
So it wouldn't,

765
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,070
it'd be a different kind of lights
there.

766
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,310
The only point I was making is that
photons,

767
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,160
particles of light can bounce off each
other.

768
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:21,420
So we see that in really high energy
experiments in particle accelerators.

769
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:26,460
We can collide photons together.
So my point was a bit of a pedantic

770
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:28,340
physicists one,
but he's because he.

771
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:32,070
It is true that light can bounce off.
It can hit light,

772
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,170
but very,
very high energy.

773
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,090
But when they press that button,
it goes

774
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,130
to a certain distance.
I wasn't,

775
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,990
that's engineering,
right?

776
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,820
I agree with you.
I agree with you.

777
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,510
The distance thing doesn't mass to it.
Right.

778
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:51,670
So as you're swinging it around,
you wouldn't have the leverage of a long

779
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,160
thing,
so why not make it really long?

780
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,530
Because it wouldn't be difficult to
swing around.

781
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,980
Like you could stab someone with a light
saber a mile away.

782
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,220
That's true.
Well that's just the laser in it.

783
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,420
Yes.
Like why?

784
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,510
Why make it so short?
Ridiculous.

785
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,610
You have to swing.
You got to be close to hitting a person

786
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:10,720
with it.
That's a silly,

787
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,100
silly design.
You are picking holes correctly in the

788
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:18,460
engineering part of my.
The only point I was making is that

789
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:19,840
physics,
is that we shut him.

790
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:23,420
He's quite interested in.
Is it light can bounce off light.

791
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,180
Yes.
So,

792
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:27,310
but it would have,
there would have to be something that

793
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:29,080
causes it to stop at the very end.

794
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,400
Yeah,
yeah,

795
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,230
yeah.
Which will be,

796
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:33,250
you're right,
it has merit,

797
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:36,070
but he wouldn't look cool with it if
there was no kind of thing with them.

798
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,320
But what drives me crazy about star wars
is not the light sabers.

799
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,670
It's the lasers when they're shooting
the guns,

800
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,340
so I'm like,
why can I see that when I can't see

801
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,550
bullets?
This is supposed to be way faster than a

802
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:51,310
bullet.
Like why is it easy to see this?

803
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,160
Because it's like you can get out of the
way.

804
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:57,790
Those things they really slow.
It would be so angry.

805
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,620
I'd be like,
this is so dumb.

806
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:03,970
I could go warp speed in this Millennium
Falcon and travel the speed of light,

807
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:07,090
but for whatever reason,
these lasers are so slow that you could

808
00:40:07,091 --> 00:40:08,770
duck out of the way of them.
That's so dumb.

809
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,480
And it's not only style loads.
He takes everything.

810
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,490
Every single film.
Does that.

811
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

812
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:19,090
Well it's like films,
like also I worked on one of these films

813
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,670
years ago.
Sunshine.

814
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,440
Very underappreciated movement.
Yeah,

815
00:40:24,441 --> 00:40:26,020
I think so.
I think it's brilliant film,

816
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,110
but in that,
so they,

817
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:28,751
they asked me,
uh,

818
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:32,020
Danny said I want to do it right.
So I'll do the spacecraft without any

819
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:33,880
sand.
So when it's traveling through space,

820
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,550
there'll be silent and it looks shit.
It just,

821
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,940
when you.
It's the same when when you try and fill

822
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:44,590
the astronauts and you and they're in
zero g and they always move slowly.

823
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,530
It's like,
why,

824
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,100
you know,
you're right,

825
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,520
you're right.
You'd be able to move very fast did you

826
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:50,080
want.
But it looks silly.

827
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,830
So this kind of a,
I suppose it's what audiences have got

828
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:57,190
used to over the years.
And so in the end you have a

829
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:03,750
partner in 2001 which didn't do it
silent in 2001.

830
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,170
Well,
Kubrick was a stickler for science and

831
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:12,280
for him he was apparently he would do
complex mathematics in his spare time.

832
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,960
Left.
Fascinating guy.

833
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:15,400
That must have been.
Yeah,

834
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,740
I read that.
They just,

835
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,070
um,
someone just found it.

836
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:22,000
Interview didn't idea of the day where
he explained the ending of 2001.

837
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,120
I didn't say that it yesterday actually.
And it was,

838
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,010
it was kind of a really simple version
of it.

839
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,873
He just said,
well,

840
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:33,390
the super intelligent beings take him in
and put him in a zoo basically,

841
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:38,710
and watch him grow old and then sending
back to the earth as a super being.

842
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,370
That's the worst explanation at the end
of 2001 I've ever heard,

843
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,740
but it was Kubrick's.
That's what cubic said,

844
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:49,210
so that he falls into the monolith.
Yeah.

845
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,630
They just put them in this room,
which is kind of a bad version of a

846
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,680
French chateau or something watching
grow old and then send him back to the

847
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,460
earth is a super being.
Wow.

848
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,510
Okay.
That was Kubrick's version.

849
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,630
Strange.
It's a,

850
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,190
it's a,
it's a weird genre,

851
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,560
right?
Because sometimes people get things

852
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:12,440
right,
like didn't hg wells predict a,

853
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:17,000
a significant amount of scientific
inventions in the future?

854
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,620
Well,
there is.

855
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,990
I mean,
defenders.

856
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,800
Which one doesn't it?
There was a moon one wasn't there.

857
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:26,801
He did an agenda to the moon.
I mean he's time machine is not able to

858
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:28,100
do that.
Really worked out yet.

859
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:32,640
I think it's,
I,

860
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,080
I always liked science fiction.
I like Arthur c Clarke a lot,

861
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,210
you know,
because I think it is.

862
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,380
You're right.
It's a form that you can let your

863
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:46,460
imagination wander and address things.
That restriction I think.

864
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,440
Did you like the alien series?
I loved it.

865
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,770
Yeah.
So I leave when I was,

866
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,680
uh,
when I was at school,

867
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:55,340
he's 19,
79 and we had a school film club and in

868
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:56,870
the seventies they weren't like they are
now,

869
00:42:56,871 --> 00:42:59,330
you know,
and so the first films they put on the

870
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:01,760
three films,
I was 11 and it was alien,

871
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,040
apocalypse now in life of Brian.
Wow.

872
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:07,490
Which I.
So that was my introduction to allow.

873
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:11,840
Well those are three great choices,
but I feel like really Scott's original

874
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:16,220
alien is probably one of the greatest
horror science fiction movies of all

875
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:18,200
time.
One of my all time favorite movies.

876
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,300
But I really liked the newer ones as
well.

877
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:23,030
Like I like promethium and I really
liked covenant.

878
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,010
The last one.
Yeah,

879
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:25,970
for ets.
I don't know,

880
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:29,720
I guess it's not the best one,
what they're trying to do with it.

881
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,430
The,
the whole idea of what the engineers

882
00:43:31,431 --> 00:43:34,910
coming back in time and that's it.
That's why I was disappointed with it

883
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,970
because I thought the,
the opening is brilliant and I thought

884
00:43:37,971 --> 00:43:42,971
this is just going to be brilliant.
I thought it just lost its way and it

885
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:45,860
was a disappointment because it could
have been so brilliant.

886
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,240
Yes,
I agree with you.

887
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,950
Yeah.
The beginning was fantastic,

888
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,700
but I think covenant was more more
exciting and.

889
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,200
Well,
it's also preposterous.

890
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:56,030
Like if you went to another planet,
I.

891
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,640
The last thing you'd be doing is just
breathing in the air.

892
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,830
Right?
I mean we'd have to be really cool if

893
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:04,370
there was a life on the planet,
we'd have to be really careful than a.

894
00:44:04,371 --> 00:44:07,400
not to contaminate but be not to be
contaminated.

895
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,263
Right?
Yeah.

896
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,320
Yeah.
I mean,

897
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:10,383
yeah.
There's also.

898
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,360
I mean,
you know,

899
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:15,830
the other thing is science fiction films
is gravity because you always give me an

900
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:17,690
alien.
You always just say the spaceships got

901
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:21,890
gravity again is only 2001.
Right where everybody floats around.

902
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:24,290
Yeah.
Because all has a spinning thing.

903
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:28,220
The spaceship has gravity and then when
you land the gravity's exactly like

904
00:44:28,221 --> 00:44:29,054
earth.
Yeah.

905
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:32,520
Perfect.
But it's ridiculous.

906
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,260
Yeah.
I've been with what are the odds that

907
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:38,040
you would find a planet that is exempt?
Like even if a planet was one and a half

908
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:40,920
times the size of earth,
it would have far more gravity.

909
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,023
Right.
And that's,

910
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,050
that's really common for a planet to be
like just a little bit bigger.

911
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,900
And then we will be like,
fuck everywhere it'd be walking.

912
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:50,940
We'd be,
we'd be getting crushed.

913
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,470
Right.
I agree with you.

914
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,960
Yeah.
Well I suppose that's not the point.

915
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,040
It's about ideas,
isn't it?

916
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:59,640
Science class and you know,
this whole idea where you just supposed

917
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:01,140
to let it,
let the,

918
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:03,500
you know,
let the story play out and.

919
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,410
Well,
I mean sunshine was um,

920
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:08,350
you know,
the,

921
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,350
the premise is,
is silly.

922
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,950
I mean it's,
the premise is the son is dying and

923
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:15,420
we're going to go and fix it.
Yeah.

924
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,403
Both of those things.

925
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:20,160
It fails on its first line in incentive
reasons,

926
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,860
but the idea is that it's not about
that.

927
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,890
It's about,
it's about the,

928
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,890
it's about the sun as a god in some
ways.

929
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:33,090
So it's about our response to the power
of nature and it's about day fighting

930
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:37,920
this thing and worshiping it and how
ultimately you go mad if you remember

931
00:45:37,921 --> 00:45:39,260
the film,
the pin backer,

932
00:45:39,261 --> 00:45:41,820
who's the first captain that went to the
captain,

933
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:43,680
the first mission to go and restart the
sun,

934
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:47,250
which is the mad bit,
but then became a religious

935
00:45:47,251 --> 00:45:51,450
fundamentalist essentially,
and then decided it's a fascinating idea

936
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:53,760
that he decides to to bring meaning to
his life.

937
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,370
He will become the last,
last man,

938
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:01,440
the last human,
and so he wants to be the lest he wants

939
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:06,441
the son to die and he wants to take
humanity with it and he decided to make

940
00:46:07,591 --> 00:46:08,100
that happen.

941
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,740
So he stays there waiting for the second
ship.

942
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:13,350
And I like those ideas that,
you know,

943
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,090
what,
what's your reaction to the power of

944
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:18,690
nature this afternoon?
One of the thing to do my shows,

945
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,760
I'm not being a commercial person,
I've just thought of it.

946
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,740
One of the great things about
cosmologies that it is terrifying in

947
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,950
the,
in the truest sense of the word mean.

948
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,350
We talked a bit about the size and scale
of the universe and black holes

949
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:33,150
colliding and those things,
you know,

950
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:38,390
it is very frightening,
but also the I think the act of trying

951
00:46:40,591 --> 00:46:45,490
to understand our place in nature and
the size and scale of the universe and

952
00:46:45,491 --> 00:46:50,491
now our tiny presence within it is
valuable.

953
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,240
It's a,
it's a so that you can be terrified but

954
00:46:54,241 --> 00:46:59,130
also inspired and interested and it's
part of if you want to find,

955
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,090
if you want to ask questions about what
it means to be human and means to be

956
00:47:03,091 --> 00:47:06,300
alive,
then I think you find the answers in

957
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:10,230
confronting that reality,
which is that we live in a terrifyingly

958
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:11,280
vast universe.

959
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:14,700
Pat,
the powers in the universe that we

960
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:17,270
cannot comprehend as you said,
but that,

961
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,950
that that's what you've got to face
because that's reality,

962
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:24,080
so you can't hide your head in the sand
and just duck it and it sends them.

963
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:28,350
It can send some people crazy.
I'm sure it is really interesting that

964
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:33,351
we need that suspension of disbelief in
order to sort of make a film on space.

965
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,950
You almost have to like go,
well this isn't really how it would be,

966
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,330
but this is how you have to make it in
order to fit it into a two hour movie.

967
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:46,810
Yeah.
And then the film as we sunshine becomes

968
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:48,300
about your.
Then you can have the film about

969
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,490
something else.
Yes.

970
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,130
[inaudible].
It's not really that well.

971
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:53,560
Did you like a event horizon?
Yeah,

972
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:56,670
I did actually.
I thought that's ridiculous.

973
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,490
I'm saying I always wanted to ask about
their,

974
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:05,370
their concept of propulsion that you
almost like space would be flat,

975
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,610
you would fold space over and you would
intersect those two points and you'd be

976
00:48:09,611 --> 00:48:12,550
able to travel vast distances
instantaneously.

977
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,930
Right.
And I'm doing a terrible job of

978
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:14,770
explaining it,
I'm sure.

979
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,610
But is that a concept that people have
actually considered?

980
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:21,790
Yeah,
you can in general relativity.

981
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:22,740
So.
So Einstein,

982
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,670
I should say.
Well it is Einstein's theory of general

983
00:48:24,671 --> 00:48:29,140
relativity is our best theory of space
and time and so it really is,

984
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:33,520
as we've talked about before,
it's you imagine space and time as a

985
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:35,560
sheet.
Just imagine it as a thing,

986
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,650
literally a sheet surface and all the
theory says is that if you put matter

987
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,030
and or energy into that,
then it curves it and distort it and it

988
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:50,500
can stretch it and make it shrink.
And so it's the response of space and

989
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:53,290
time to matter and energy.
So if you,

990
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:56,230
if you,
the simplest version will be the sun.

991
00:48:56,231 --> 00:49:01,120
So you put the big spherical ball of
stuff in there and it warp space and

992
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:03,880
time searched at the nice straight
lines,

993
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,410
something just traveling minute.

994
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:09,430
So in business through that warp space
turns into an orbit and that's why you

995
00:49:09,431 --> 00:49:11,860
can actually kind of see things that are
behind the sun.

996
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:15,640
Yeah,
so light bends around the sun because

997
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:17,860
it's just traveling through the curved
space.

998
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,620
The earth goes around the sun because
it's just rolling,

999
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:23,320
minding its own business through the
curve space.

1000
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,010
So an example would be,
you might say,

1001
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:29,550
well how does curb space,
how can connect,

1002
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:31,330
give rise to something?
It looks like a force,

1003
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:34,510
which is gravity.
So the best analogy I know of is to

1004
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:38,200
think of walking around on the surface
of the earth to be stand on the equator

1005
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:41,380
of the earth and you with your friend
and you say,

1006
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:44,020
we're going to do north.
So we're going to set off,

1007
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:47,680
let's say we're a thousand miles apart
on the equator and we're gonna walk due

1008
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:49,270
north and what's going to happen?

1009
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,180
So you walk in straight lines,
you don't change direction,

1010
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:55,510
you don't do any accelerating,
but the straight lines and lines of

1011
00:49:55,511 --> 00:49:59,680
longitude on the surface of the earth.
So as you go further and further north,

1012
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:02,620
you get closer and closer together and
he carried onto the pole.

1013
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:06,770
You bump into each other,
but nothing's happened and no one's no

1014
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,110
one.
There's no forces acting.

1015
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,920
It's just that you're moving on a curved
surface and so you get closer.

1016
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,580
And that's basically Einstein's theory
of general relativity.

1017
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,970
Now,
why did I start talking about event

1018
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,730
horizon?
The idea of a full.

1019
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,160
Oh yeah.
So,

1020
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,100
so you can.
So all you have to do,

1021
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:29,090
so those folded kinds of geometries is
you have to try and specify hat where

1022
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:32,780
you would put the matter and what kind
of stuff you'd put there to make the

1023
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:35,180
geometry fold in that way.

1024
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,490
And you can do,
you can do it so you can.

1025
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,030
You can write down that geometry is
called a warp drive.

1026
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:43,880
Geometry I think is called that is in
textbooks.

1027
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,150
So you can do that too.
To have a warp drive.

1028
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:52,220
The question becomes what sorts of stuff
would you have to actually put into the

1029
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:54,800
real universe to make it warp in that
way.

1030
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,570
And it always usually turns out that
it's the kind of stuff that doesn't

1031
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:02,240
exist,
but it has properties.

1032
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:06,980
Is Matt sort of matter or sort of energy
that has properties that do not exist in

1033
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:10,490
nature as far as we can tell,
but you can still write the geometry

1034
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:13,600
down in Einstein's theory.
So if you had the sadness,

1035
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:17,180
guilt force or mass or whatever it is,
if you had that stuff that doesn't

1036
00:51:17,181 --> 00:51:18,980
exist,
it is a concept that.

1037
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,340
Yeah.
So the geometry exists is so you can.

1038
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,810
You can,
you can do it and you can do the

1039
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:26,030
calculations and you can see the walk
drive,

1040
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:30,710
you can construct wormholes that connect
distant regions of the universe,

1041
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:35,180
which you could use as time machines and
you can do all that in the theory,

1042
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:38,540
but in nature you'd have to have the
right stuff to do it,

1043
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,070
but that stuff is not real.
That seems to be as far as we know now

1044
00:51:43,071 --> 00:51:47,240
what would have to happen,
like you would have to have enough power

1045
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:50,730
or mass to be able to fold those two
things together.

1046
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,420
It tends to be weird stuff like,
um,

1047
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,200
stuff that has a negative pressure or
something like that.

1048
00:51:57,201 --> 00:52:02,201
So stuff that has physical properties
that are just bizarre and that no matter

1049
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:07,610
or energy that we know of in the
universe has so that to make,

1050
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,350
to make the geometry happen.

1051
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:14,530
But it's conceivable in theory that this
could exist even though it doesn't.

1052
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,070
It's a,
it's a,

1053
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,010
it's a dba ultimately.
Um,

1054
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,840
so wormholes that a good example.
So that would be quite literally it.

1055
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,260
We talked about the surface of the
earth.

1056
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,400
So you fly to Australia from La and you
have to go quite a long way around the

1057
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,910
edge of the earth or you could turn or
straight through and get there quicker.

1058
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,090
So you get that.
That's a word.

1059
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,250
Jamie's got a little graphic up there
and there it is.

1060
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:41,480
So you could go all the way around the
edge or you could take the shortcut.

1061
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,900
So the question is,
so you can do that in theory,

1062
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:47,390
you can write down that geometry and
there it is.

1063
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,760
So the first question is can you make
it?

1064
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,850
And as we've said,
we don't think that stuff exists.

1065
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,110
There's a second set of theoretical bits
of theoretical work,

1066
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,060
which if you had a worm hole then what
would happen if you tried to travel

1067
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:07,061
through it and what seems to happen is
that is that they become unstable the

1068
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:10,460
moment anything tries to go through.

1069
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:14,120
So you get kind of a feedback of stuff
going through and through and through

1070
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:17,120
and through and so it collapses and that
there's a great.

1071
00:53:17,121 --> 00:53:19,400
There's a great book by Kip Thorne
actually we just mentioned him.

1072
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:23,300
He got the Nobel Prize last year for the
gravitational waves and he wrote a

1073
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:25,350
brilliant book,
things in the eighties called black

1074
00:53:25,351 --> 00:53:28,980
holes and time warps way talks about
the.

1075
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:34,230
The answer is we don't fully know,
but most physicists thing that even if

1076
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:36,900
they existed,
they will be unstable and as soon as you

1077
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:39,030
even tried to transmit information
through them,

1078
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,330
send a bit of light through,
then there will be sought feedback and

1079
00:53:42,331 --> 00:53:44,700
they'd collapse.
And ultimately the reason we don't

1080
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:49,170
really know absolutely is because you
need what's called a quantum theory of

1081
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:54,171
gravity and we don't have one,
so we don't have the theoretical tools

1082
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:59,040
to be absolutely sure that these things
would be unstable or don't exist in

1083
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:02,010
nature,
but we strongly suspect that they don't.

1084
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:04,020
If they did,
you could build a time machine.

1085
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:09,300
So there Stephen Hawking wrote a paper
called the chronology protection

1086
00:54:09,301 --> 00:54:11,130
conjecture,
um,

1087
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,620
and conjectures the important word.
So he,

1088
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:18,780
at the conjecture basically was that the
laws of nature will be such that you

1089
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:21,630
can't have stable wormholes and you
can't build time machines.

1090
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,610
And if you send something through it,
it would destabilize it.

1091
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:30,180
And if it didn't destabilize it,
how would your physical body deal with

1092
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:31,890
the stress of that?
Well,

1093
00:54:31,891 --> 00:54:34,530
it doesn't have to be that you can.
You can build them.

1094
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,860
That's called the tidal gravitational
force.

1095
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:40,930
So it's the difference in gravitational
pull across your body because you.

1096
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,990
One of the things that gets you to fall
into a black hole,

1097
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:47,490
so before you actually get to the
singularity you can get is called

1098
00:54:47,491 --> 00:54:51,030
Spaghetti fight.
So you get there and it's just like the

1099
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:53,430
moon's,
you know the tidal effects on the earth,

1100
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:56,820
which is quite small,
but they still raised hides on the

1101
00:54:56,821 --> 00:54:57,654
oceans.

1102
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,300
So that can be.
If you think about something like a

1103
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:03,270
black hole,
that can be any massive difference in

1104
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:05,850
gravitational pull from your head to
your feet.

1105
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,150
And so it can stretch you out.
And so what you can with wormholes you,

1106
00:55:10,151 --> 00:55:13,230
you can,
you can write the geometry down the

1107
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:17,130
United States theory such that you could
go through so you don't have to be

1108
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,800
destroyed or anything weird happened to
you.

1109
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,650
Would you have to have some something
protecting you?

1110
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,060
Some force,
some,

1111
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,200
some sort of a.
You just literally eat,

1112
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:27,770
fall through.
I mean it's so,

1113
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,500
so you know,
if they were,

1114
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,020
they were,
they exist.

1115
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:32,580
You just,
you just go through,

1116
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,700
you sit in a little spaceship but you,
you,

1117
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:39,540
you wouldn't.
There's nothing inherently in them that

1118
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:42,330
says that you will be ripped apart or
anything like that.

1119
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:48,170
But what are your thoughts on,
on alien life,

1120
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:52,380
on life outside of this planet as
something you think about?

1121
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:55,980
Yeah,
I think there must be.

1122
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:00,090
I'm even in the solar system,
I would not be surprised if we find

1123
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:04,440
microbes on Mars are sort of the moons
of Jupiter or Saturn where there's

1124
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:06,180
liquid water like Europa.
Yeah,

1125
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,910
and the reason is that if you think
about.

1126
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:13,350
The reason I think that guests is
because if you look at the history of

1127
00:56:13,351 --> 00:56:17,210
life on earth,
then so earth formed and it was just a.

1128
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,910
There was no life.
It was a ball of rock an almost.

1129
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:24,220
As soon as it cooled down,
we see evidence of life.

1130
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:26,740
So certainly three point 8 billion years
ago,

1131
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:30,820
possibly even further back than that.
We see evidence of life on earth.

1132
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:35,530
So somewhere along the line,
geochemistry,

1133
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:40,740
active geochemistry became biochemistry
on earth and we have some idea,

1134
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,880
you know,
that the,

1135
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:47,881
if you get a gradient of temperature and
acid and alkaline and the conditions

1136
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:51,400
that are naturally present on the
surface of oceans,

1137
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,260
then complex carbon chemistry
spontaneously happens.

1138
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:00,460
So we have a.
We know that life almost certainly we

1139
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:03,430
know that life began on earth.
I mean the other opportunity came from

1140
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,760
space or something like that,
but probably didn't really properly

1141
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,720
began on earth.
And so that means that at least here

1142
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:15,490
that happened and we know that the
conditions that lead to the origin of

1143
00:57:15,491 --> 00:57:18,670
life on earth were present a miles three
point eight,

1144
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:21,910
4 billion years ago.
And we know that they're present on

1145
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:26,170
Europa today.
So I don't see that there's anything

1146
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:30,300
special.
Life is just chemistry and it and the,

1147
00:57:30,301 --> 00:57:34,120
the idea that geochemistry becomes
biochemistry's not fanciful because it

1148
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:37,810
happened here.
So I think that given the same

1149
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:40,900
conditions,
it will be surprising to me at the same

1150
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:44,440
thing didn't happen in that life begins.
So I,

1151
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:46,900
I,
that's one of the two tests.

1152
00:57:46,901 --> 00:57:50,500
That is one of the great frontiers of
science now,

1153
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,410
which one of the great challenges,
which is why another reason we're

1154
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:56,170
interested in Mars,
because we know those conditions where

1155
00:57:56,171 --> 00:57:58,120
there,
we know there were what's called

1156
00:57:58,121 --> 00:58:01,330
hydrothermal vent systems on the floors,
have oceans on Mars,

1157
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,820
three point eight or 4 billion years
ago.

1158
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:09,130
So it will be good to know what I've
said is right and the way we find out is

1159
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:11,410
to find life or evidence of past life.

1160
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,470
Are you aware of,
uh,

1161
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,410
the speculation that was going around
with how recent was it that occupy

1162
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,244
thing,
the,

1163
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,270
uh,
uh,

1164
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,700
the octopus eggs,
they,

1165
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:27,730
there was a group of scientists that
were speculating that it's Panspermia

1166
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:32,240
the idea of Panspermia,
that it's possible that Octopi had come

1167
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:36,810
from somewhere else and frozen eggs had
actually come from somewhere else and

1168
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,230
landed on earth.
And these are like legitimate scientists

1169
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,170
are contemplating not morons.
I don't think I've seen this,

1170
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,710
the,
no,

1171
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:44,940
I didn't,
but I mean it.

1172
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:48,410
So panspermia doesn't have to be
unlikely.

1173
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:49,131
I mean,
for example,

1174
00:58:49,131 --> 00:58:51,610
you might have seen the other day we
found an earth rock on the mood.

1175
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,401
Yes,
right.

1176
00:58:52,401 --> 00:58:55,370
Well they'll back on this now because he
apollo astronauts brought it back in the

1177
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,720
4 billion years old or something.
One of the oldest rocks ever found.

1178
00:58:58,721 --> 00:58:59,430
Yeah.
So.

1179
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:00,590
So we know that material

1180
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:05,800
transfer between planets and so it's not
inconceivable that microbes could

1181
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:08,020
survive that journey.
Right.

1182
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,150
We know that microbes can survive in
space,

1183
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:13,330
for example,
so that isn't mad.

1184
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,490
It's probably unlikely,
but he's not mad.

1185
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,500
But with the octopus I hadn't heard
that,

1186
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:22,340
but the thing is that the octopus is
still extremely biologically

1187
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:25,190
to us.
I mean the difference is negligible,

1188
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:29,450
so it's still got the same energy system
with a single ATP and DNA and all that

1189
00:59:29,451 --> 00:59:30,590
stuff.
It's all very,

1190
00:59:30,591 --> 00:59:33,260
very similar.
It was something about rna and DNA.

1191
00:59:33,261 --> 00:59:34,310
Did you find that out?

1192
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,180
I'm enough.
I'm looking at a different one from a

1193
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:37,860
different website.
It's about the same thing.

1194
00:59:37,861 --> 00:59:42,390
It has to do with the Cambrian explosion
and there were 33 authors on a paper

1195
00:59:42,391 --> 00:59:47,391
that got published and the progress and
in biophysics and molecular biology that

1196
00:59:47,611 --> 00:59:50,100
talked about this possibility.
There are other people that disagree

1197
00:59:50,101 --> 00:59:50,934
with it though.

1198
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,110
Right.
I suppose the,

1199
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:54,810
I haven't seen it,
so I think it's unlikely because the

1200
00:59:54,811 --> 00:59:58,500
octopus is extremely similar to us,
so that suggests a common origin.

1201
00:59:58,501 --> 01:00:02,660
To me that's a pose.
The cancer argument you could,

1202
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:06,060
you could advance would be there's only
one way to do life,

1203
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,960
so you could say the actually given
because the laws of physics and

1204
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:14,340
chemistry the same everywhere,
so maybe it's maybe DNA,

1205
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,210
which is the only way to do it.
So that's the way it gets done.

1206
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:22,110
Which is why they're so similar to us is
so alien as well.

1207
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,240
Yeah,
they're not though,

1208
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:25,620
you know,
that's the thing.

1209
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:27,780
If not.
So that's why I'm surprised about

1210
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,210
because they're not that alien.
They're very similar.

1211
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:35,370
While they're in their abilities,
their ability to transform their texture

1212
01:00:35,371 --> 01:00:37,830
and their color instant almost
instantaneously.

1213
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,300
They have incredible camouflage
abilities that really don't exist in the

1214
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,770
mammalian world.

1215
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,270
Yeah.
But on a cellular level,

1216
01:00:45,271 --> 01:00:48,390
you look at Knox for sell in among under
a microscope and you wouldn't be able to

1217
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:50,990
sell the treating not for selling
humans.

1218
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,900
So the only way that that would make
sense as if all life comes from

1219
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:58,350
basically the same kind of building
blocks and just varies depending upon

1220
01:00:58,351 --> 01:01:00,850
the conditions and where it takes place.
I'm,

1221
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,220
I'm guessing,
but yes,

1222
01:01:02,221 --> 01:01:03,290
that,
that that must be the.

1223
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:06,930
The only way you could sustain that,
given that they're so similar to us

1224
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:12,140
because they really are biochemically,
is that that's the only way it can be

1225
01:01:12,691 --> 01:01:15,990
done given the given the building block,
the toolkit,

1226
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,560
the laws of nature and the elements and
so on that we have in our universe,

1227
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:22,290
we have so many different life forms on
our planet,

1228
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:26,490
but if we found anything that's remotely
similar to what we have here on earth,

1229
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,530
on another planet,
it would be such an incredible

1230
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:29,330
discovery.

1231
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:32,040
Like we sat,
we found a frog on the moon.

1232
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,500
I mean the world would stop.
Right.

1233
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:39,330
I'd be very surprised if we found
anything anywhere that is any,

1234
01:01:39,331 --> 01:01:42,210
in any way similar.
An insect on Mars.

1235
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,313
Well,
this is.

1236
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,870
I mean,
as I said,

1237
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:46,820
it'd be micro.
I think every single celled things

1238
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:48,690
remember.
I mean you mentioned the Cambrian

1239
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:50,130
explosion,
so that is that.

1240
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:52,830
What we do know that earth is that
although life began,

1241
01:01:52,831 --> 01:01:54,570
let's say three point 8 billion years
ago,

1242
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:58,080
it wasn't until around 600 million years
ago or so,

1243
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:03,590
that maybe most 700 that you see any
complex multicellular organisms at all.

1244
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,920
So if there's something like 3 billion
years,

1245
01:02:07,921 --> 01:02:12,921
it was single celled alone and that's
one of the reasons why I would guess if

1246
01:02:14,011 --> 01:02:16,020
I had to guess,
I would say that microbes would be

1247
01:02:16,021 --> 01:02:19,920
common because life began very quickly
on earth and I wouldn't be surprised to

1248
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:20,060
find

1249
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,440
finding on Mars,
but complex life,

1250
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:24,750
multicellular life,
insects,

1251
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,480
plants,
intelligence,

1252
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:32,600
I would guess will be very rare because
it took so long on earth to get there

1253
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:37,320
and you just slime bag.
Three billion years of slime.

1254
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,130
That was it.
On what happened?

1255
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:43,570
How did it go from slime?
Two giraffes.

1256
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:49,010
It's very quickly once he wanted to go
in and it's one of the great unsolved

1257
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:54,780
mysteries in biology that one thing that
is true is that we seem to be all

1258
01:02:54,781 --> 01:02:58,100
complex creatures seemed to be and we
were called.

1259
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:01,170
You carry it,
writers yourselves with the cell nucleus

1260
01:03:01,171 --> 01:03:05,490
and all that kind of stuff and they look
like they're the merger between two

1261
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:10,491
simpler life forms of bacteria and a
thing called an archaic and okay,

1262
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:15,690
and so it looks like somewhere in 2
billion years ago,

1263
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,160
whatever it was,
in some ocean,

1264
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:22,730
the bacteria cell got inside the arcane
and survived as,

1265
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:29,241
as a symbiotic organism essentially,
and then somehow unbelievably managed to

1266
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:36,180
reproduce and replicate in that
configuration and that does seem to be

1267
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:38,640
the origin of all complex,
multicellular life on earth.

1268
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,640
So it's called a fateful encounter
hypothesis.

1269
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:47,180
And if that's true then it's just a bit
of luck and it happened once.

1270
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,150
Right?
And that's why we're here now when blind

1271
01:03:51,151 --> 01:03:55,570
look considerably like how many billion
earth like planets did you say exists

1272
01:03:55,571 --> 01:03:57,780
just in our sources to the alone in the
galaxy?

1273
01:03:57,781 --> 01:03:59,100
20 billion,
something like that.

1274
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:04,080
So one in 10 styles.
So the odds of complex life out of our

1275
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:08,940
incredibly fortunate situation,
but the odds of that occurring on any of

1276
01:04:08,941 --> 01:04:11,610
these billions of other planets that
exist,

1277
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:15,030
we don't know,
but let's say the earth is.

1278
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,160
Let's say it was under the fortunate
side,

1279
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:18,150
so,
so we're,

1280
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:20,850
we're,
we're talking about give or take 4

1281
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:21,360
billion years,
right?

1282
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,690
And the origin of life to now,
and we have a civilization now and we've

1283
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:26,760
had it.
Our species has been around what,

1284
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:28,110
a quarter of a million years or
something.

1285
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:31,920
So it's just now basically.
So let's say 4 billion is on the

1286
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,850
fortunate side,
let's say that it was double that or

1287
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,390
triple that on the average.
Suddenly that's the age of the universe,

1288
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,670
right?
That's a third of the age of the

1289
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:45,330
universe.
So how many of those worlds had been

1290
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:50,331
stable for three or 4 billion years?
That's quite a tall order actually.

1291
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:56,430
It looks like our solar system might be
quite unusual in that respect that

1292
01:04:56,431 --> 01:04:59,100
because they had the planet,
it's got to remain stable in a stable

1293
01:04:59,101 --> 01:05:01,710
orbit.
The stars got to remain stable.

1294
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:07,710
System stabilizes at Jupiter.
Plays a big role.

1295
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:09,710
Takes of treatments.
Yeah,

1296
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,420
socks and soap and that you know that
there's a thing.

1297
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:15,300
There's a theory called the grand tack
theory,

1298
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:20,560
which is very hard to explain the
evolution of our solar system so that

1299
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:22,660
when you do compete a models of solar
systems,

1300
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:27,070
you don't tend to get for rocky planets
too close to the sun and for big gas

1301
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:27,460
giants.

1302
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:30,370
Further out,
and one of the current best theories,

1303
01:05:30,371 --> 01:05:33,460
and this I say this because it shows you
how lucky we might be,

1304
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:38,740
is that Jeff said that they tend to form
these big gas Jane's and migrate inwards

1305
01:05:38,741 --> 01:05:41,230
towards the Star.
So in almost all the computer

1306
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:43,690
simulations,
just because you got this big gas giant

1307
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:48,550
obits and all the dust around this star.
They tend to drop in woods and it looks

1308
01:05:48,551 --> 01:05:51,790
like Jupiter did that.
So it looks like it formed and came in

1309
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:57,120
and came in almost to where Mars orbitz
today and cleared out the region around

1310
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:59,800
Mars actually.
Which is maybe the reason Mars is so

1311
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:02,800
small compared to the other to Venus and
earth.

1312
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:07,900
But then Saturn was coming in as well.
And in the computer models.

1313
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:12,901
The interaction between Jupiter and
Saturn Stop Jupiter coming in before it

1314
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:14,260
gets to the earth.

1315
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:19,390
And they both get dragged out again and
so to where they are today and so,

1316
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:22,000
and that,
that seems to be,

1317
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,610
it's one of the best theories for the
evolution of our solar system.

1318
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:29,940
So what are the chances that the chances
of that are so many skill?

1319
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,480
My tiny.
So that's the thing I think about these

1320
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:38,080
rocky planets in order to get a
civilization on them.

1321
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:42,280
I think you need,
I guess you need quite unusual solar

1322
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:47,281
systems that will be a guest and you
need quite unusual stability on the

1323
01:06:47,321 --> 01:06:49,810
planet for,
for billions of years.

1324
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,300
And that's why I think we might be quite
lucky.

1325
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:56,350
Hmm.
And how does bodes law work?

1326
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:59,530
Bodes laws,
a method of detecting if you look at the

1327
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:03,790
mass of a planet,
you can accurately detect how much mass

1328
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:07,480
and the size of a neighboring planet.
I think it wasn't just the,

1329
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,740
um,
the physicians of the obits I think

1330
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,073
we're in.

1331
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:12,460
Yeah.
And uh,

1332
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:16,100
it's one thing that is true,
but our solar system is that you,

1333
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:20,590
if you get the computer simulations,
you can't put more planets in to try and

1334
01:07:20,591 --> 01:07:21,550
fill,
put more planets.

1335
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,860
And they become,
it becomes unstable very quickly.

1336
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,600
So the,
the mass of like,

1337
01:07:25,601 --> 01:07:30,601
if you measure Mars,
you can accurately depict where the next

1338
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,450
planet close to it would be.
It,

1339
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,180
it was,
I mean it was,

1340
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,300
that's what was done was at 17th century
or something.

1341
01:07:37,301 --> 01:07:39,610
I can't remember his along yet.
It was just one of those things where,

1342
01:07:39,611 --> 01:07:42,100
you know,
it's a pattern and they were just trying

1343
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:44,470
to figure out what the answer is.
Just a pattern which is,

1344
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:46,040
um,
you know,

1345
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:49,570
not,
there's nothing to that really other

1346
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:54,340
than to say that most simulations of the
solar system,

1347
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:56,740
if there are,
if you put other planet saying they tend

1348
01:07:56,741 --> 01:08:00,010
to get thrown out by gravitational
interactions.

1349
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:03,880
So there is a sense in which our solar
system has got as much stuff in it as it

1350
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:07,000
could have.
So the planets and nicely spaced and

1351
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:08,290
you're right,
given the massive them,

1352
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:12,250
that depends on how close to the planet
can be before the interaction goes

1353
01:08:12,251 --> 01:08:14,320
wrong.
And it gets thrown out into the

1354
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,290
intergalactic space.
Something.

1355
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,570
Because planets do that,
you know,

1356
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:19,610
we,
we know that planets get thrown out of

1357
01:08:19,611 --> 01:08:22,310
solar systems by gravitational
interactions.

1358
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:24,560
So it,
yeah.

1359
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:28,370
So again,
it points to the fact that solar systems

1360
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:32,330
are not a not stable over long periods
of time.

1361
01:08:32,331 --> 01:08:36,710
They're not like clockwork.
Things not like Newtonian clockwork and

1362
01:08:36,711 --> 01:08:39,100
it just goes on forever.
They're not like that,

1363
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:44,270
that they evolve and planets can shift
orbitz and change and what we know,

1364
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,910
maybe look at the surface of the moon,
for example,

1365
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,900
it covered in craters and that was,
cause they all seem to hit about the

1366
01:08:50,901 --> 01:08:54,920
same time and it's about three point 8
billion years ago or so.

1367
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:56,930
Uh,
and that's called the late heavy

1368
01:08:56,931 --> 01:09:00,210
bombardment.
So we know that if you look at cratering

1369
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,380
and rates on Mars or the moon,
it all seemed to happen in this,

1370
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,440
not all,
but a big peak around that time.

1371
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:11,450
And that seems to be correlated with
Neptune moving outwards in the solar

1372
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:14,960
system and into Kuyper belt,
basically our towards the Kuyper belt

1373
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:18,620
and causing all sorts of havoc and
everything comes into the inner solar

1374
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:21,770
system.
So those things happen and it didn't

1375
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:23,870
happen when life was established on the
earth,

1376
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:29,080
so it's all extremely old stuff that
shifting to explore.

1377
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,280
But how long,
how long is the source system,

1378
01:09:31,281 --> 01:09:36,281
but in this particular stable situation
that's in it since about three point 8

1379
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:41,150
billion years ago.
So if it'd been unstable at any point

1380
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:44,090
since then,
then we likely wouldn't be here.

1381
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:47,060
Right.
Do you think that it's possible?

1382
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:49,730
Do you ever entertain the idea that it's
possible that we are the only

1383
01:09:49,731 --> 01:09:53,110
intelligent life in the known universe?
I,

1384
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:57,200
I,
I tend to restrict myself to the galaxy.

1385
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,420
So I do think it's possible that at the
moment there's one civilization in the

1386
01:10:02,421 --> 01:10:07,421
Milky Way and that says,
and I think that's important actually.

1387
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:12,740
It goes back to I was saying at the
start about the astronomy and cosmology

1388
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:17,090
being part of the framework within which
you have to think if you're looking for

1389
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:21,740
meaning or you're looking for how we
should behave even politically.

1390
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:24,140
You know,
the that has a bearing to me.

1391
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,320
I mean,
imagine that we're the only place where

1392
01:10:27,321 --> 01:10:32,321
there is intelligence in this galaxy and
how should we behave,

1393
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:35,600
right?
Should we actually not withstanding the

1394
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:40,430
fact that we're tiny and fragile things
an insignificant physically should we

1395
01:10:40,431 --> 01:10:45,431
consider ourselves extremely valuable in
that respect because there's nowhere

1396
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:49,970
else where you know that I would go as
far as to say there will be nowhere else

1397
01:10:49,971 --> 01:10:54,110
where meaning exists in the Milky Way in
because meeting.

1398
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:56,420
It's one of those things that scientists
don't talk about very much.

1399
01:10:56,421 --> 01:11:00,290
Although Richard Fineman,
one of my great heroes did talk about

1400
01:11:00,291 --> 01:11:02,000
it.
There's a quote where he says,

1401
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,040
well,
is the meaning of it all?

1402
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:06,680
It's a great essay called the value of
science,

1403
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:12,050
and so what is self evidently true is
that meaning exists here because it

1404
01:11:12,051 --> 01:11:15,390
means something to us.
So that's kind of an obvious statement.

1405
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:19,320
Your life means something to you in May
and so meaning exists,

1406
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,550
but I think it is a local and temporary
phenomenon.

1407
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:25,590
I think it's.
It emerges,

1408
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:29,220
meaning emerges from configurations of
atoms,

1409
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:32,490
which is what we are.
We are simply that.

1410
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:34,950
We're nothing more than that.
We're very,

1411
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:37,980
very rare configuration of atoms I
think,

1412
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:43,850
and so that means that we are,
if you go all the way down that line of

1413
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:47,130
logic,
we are the only island meaning in the

1414
01:11:47,131 --> 01:11:47,920
galaxy.

1415
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,960
I will meaning only to ourselves.
Yeah.

1416
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:56,780
It means something to us because we're
the only ones who can grasp the concept

1417
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:00,000
and we are finite.
We are finite organism,

1418
01:12:00,001 --> 01:12:04,830
we have this temporary existence while
we're here and to us there is meaning.

1419
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:06,060
Yeah.
And that's,

1420
01:12:06,061 --> 01:12:09,030
I don't know any other way to define it.
So I'll define it like that.

1421
01:12:09,031 --> 01:12:10,500
Yes.
I don't think there's a globe.

1422
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,470
Yeah.
Otherwise you have to believe there's

1423
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,030
some kind of global meaning God type
finger.

1424
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,400
Uh,
I don't think that's.

1425
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:22,800
I think it's more wonderful and more
challenging to us because we have to

1426
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:27,801
take responsibility for it to say we
should operate such that we are it in

1427
01:12:28,801 --> 01:12:30,690
this galaxy.
There's nothing else.

1428
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,640
I'm sure.
I'm just,

1429
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,820
I'm sure there are other civilizations
out there in the universe because there

1430
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:37,720
are 2 trillion galaxies.
I,

1431
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:41,220
I just can't believe this hasn't
happened in other places.

1432
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,440
The question is how often does it
happen?

1433
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:47,580
And how widely spaced are the
civilizations and I think they're very

1434
01:12:47,581 --> 01:12:52,140
widely spaced and I think there may be
one or two per galaxy on the average.

1435
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:56,610
I could put that as you said,
that what you said it beautifully,

1436
01:12:56,611 --> 01:12:58,290
that.
What else can we think?

1437
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:00,570
Well,
what else do you want?

1438
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:02,640
I mean,
I think what it says is you have to take

1439
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:07,200
responsibility for all of those things
or spiritual things that you think about

1440
01:13:07,201 --> 01:13:09,280
and the emotional things you think about
it,

1441
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:09,960
you,
you,

1442
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,630
you are,
you are responsible for that.

1443
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:15,900
You are that,
that whatever that is,

1444
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:20,190
it exists in you and it will only exist
for a short amount of time.

1445
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:25,450
And so what you know make the best of it
will be my view.

1446
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:30,470
It's so unbelievably compelling though
to consider the idea that somewhere out

1447
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:35,930
there there's another civilization that
maybe even more advanced than us and

1448
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,880
this,
this thought of it is just so

1449
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:39,750
attractive.

1450
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,970
It's,
it's incredible.

1451
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,520
That shit should be.
If,

1452
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:48,600
if civilizations are common or even
slightly common,

1453
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,840
then there should be civilizations ahead
of us.

1454
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,760
Yes,
because there's been so much time,

1455
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:55,230
but when you want to see what that's
like,

1456
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:56,790
I mean,
we've been so compelling.

1457
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:59,970
You imagined the timescales.
We've been around a civilization,

1458
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,490
let's say 40,000 years.
I don't know how long I civilization's

1459
01:14:03,491 --> 01:14:05,590
been around.
Let's say that the,

1460
01:14:05,591 --> 01:14:08,280
the,
the galaxy is pretty much as old as the

1461
01:14:08,281 --> 01:14:12,460
universe.
Thirteen billion years worth of time.

1462
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:16,780
So the idea that there are no,
no civilization zeroes,

1463
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:18,850
you know,
100 million years ago,

1464
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,400
200 million years ago,
1 billion years ago.

1465
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,640
And imagine what they'd be like if
they'd survived.

1466
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:25,391
I mean,
we've been,

1467
01:14:25,391 --> 01:14:28,990
we've been around,
we've had science for let's say since

1468
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:32,650
Newton or copernicus,
500 years at most we've had.

1469
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:36,130
And look what we've done.
We've gone beyond the solar system with

1470
01:14:36,131 --> 01:14:36,964
voyager.

1471
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:41,140
We've walked on the moon and we were
about to go to Mars,

1472
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:43,870
I would think.
So we're about to begin colonizing our

1473
01:14:43,871 --> 01:14:48,250
own solar system.
And so we've done that in 500 years.

1474
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:52,480
So imagine a million years in the
future.

1475
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:55,810
So I would.
It's one of the arguments often used to

1476
01:14:55,811 --> 01:14:57,730
say,
there aren't any civilizations out there

1477
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:00,850
in the galaxy.
It's called the Fermi paradox because if

1478
01:15:00,851 --> 01:15:03,340
you imagine a civilization that's a
million years ahead of us,

1479
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,520
they should have written their presence
across the sky by now.

1480
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,510
They should use to see him.
I mean,

1481
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:12,940
you'll see us if we survive in million
years into the future.

1482
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:16,000
Actually even a few thousand years into
the future,

1483
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:20,530
we will be exploring the galaxy.
We will have spacecraft that are going

1484
01:15:20,531 --> 01:15:22,270
to wear the stars.
We will be doing it,

1485
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:27,630
so our signature will become visible.
I'm sure if we last into the medium

1486
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:28,860
term,

1487
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:33,860
we choose to not do that.
Here's my thought on that is uncontacted

1488
01:15:34,261 --> 01:15:39,030
tribes like do you know about the.
The gentleman who was the missionary who

1489
01:15:39,031 --> 01:15:42,090
visited North Sentinel Island and was
killed by the natives,

1490
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:45,000
north central island,
which is a really unusual place because

1491
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:48,390
they branched off from Africa 60,000
years ago and they've been living on

1492
01:15:48,391 --> 01:15:52,440
this one small island the size of
Manhattan and as well as we know there's

1493
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:56,600
only about 39 of them left somewhere
around there and um,

1494
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:59,880
we can't,
we're not supposed to contact them like

1495
01:15:59,881 --> 01:16:04,260
people are not supposed we're supposed
to like leave them alone and there are

1496
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:06,210
rare tribe when they find them in the
Amazon,

1497
01:16:06,211 --> 01:16:10,170
the uncontacted tribes,
our initial instincts back off and leave

1498
01:16:10,171 --> 01:16:11,520
them alone,
leave them alone.

1499
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:16,260
Do you think that perhaps the universe,
like if there is a civilization that's a

1500
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,900
million times more advanced than us have
been around here for,

1501
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,880
you know,
that millions of years of life as

1502
01:16:20,881 --> 01:16:24,360
opposed to quarter million,
why would they,

1503
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,110
why would they let us know?
They look at us dropping bombs on each

1504
01:16:28,111 --> 01:16:32,300
other and polluting the ocean,
sucking all the fish out and putting

1505
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:35,850
clouds into the skies of dirt and
particles.

1506
01:16:35,851 --> 01:16:38,240
And why would they literally look at
these crude monkey?

1507
01:16:38,241 --> 01:16:42,510
So are there data there is so far beyond
where they need to be before they could

1508
01:16:42,511 --> 01:16:46,410
join the galactic civilization or
whatever it is.

1509
01:16:46,411 --> 01:16:48,600
True.
It's an argument that the reason.

1510
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:49,080
Okay.
No argument

1511
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:53,310
as well.
The IT technology so advanced would be

1512
01:16:53,311 --> 01:16:56,970
difficult for us to detect.
I mean we tend to think of know when you

1513
01:16:56,971 --> 01:16:59,140
say written across the sky,
I suppose it's trigger.

1514
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:01,680
I'm thinking of star ships and things
like star wars,

1515
01:17:01,681 --> 01:17:02,880
right?
Big Energy.

1516
01:17:02,881 --> 01:17:04,650
Things that you can see the signature
of,

1517
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:08,370
but actually maybe the.
The civilization just becomes a nano

1518
01:17:08,371 --> 01:17:10,030
civilization.
Tiny

1519
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:11,720
little.
None of us because that's more

1520
01:17:11,721 --> 01:17:13,670
efficient.
It's a better way to do things.

1521
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:17,720
So it's possible.
I suppose that there are space probes

1522
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:20,750
all over the place.
They're so small and it's so efficient

1523
01:17:20,751 --> 01:17:24,830
and you sell it low energy that we just
don't see them as far as that is

1524
01:17:24,831 --> 01:17:27,800
possible.
My other thought is that where we are

1525
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:30,800
headed,
it seems to me that there's some sort of

1526
01:17:30,801 --> 01:17:33,920
a strange symbiosis that's taking place.
There's a,

1527
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:38,810
there's a strange connection that we
have to electronics and ultimately to an

1528
01:17:38,811 --> 01:17:41,180
artificial creation,
artificial intelligence,

1529
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,700
whatever you want to call it,
artificial light life,

1530
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:48,020
something that's created by carbon based
beings.

1531
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:51,110
Stem cell,
you are beings that isn't cellular,

1532
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:56,090
but also acts like life,
that this may be the future of life,

1533
01:17:56,390 --> 01:18:01,390
that we are so connected to the idea of
flesh and blood and bone,

1534
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:07,090
but maybe this is just a temporary
situation until we transition or not

1535
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:11,480
transition to,
it surpasses us and this is the next

1536
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:15,830
stage of life,
but this stage has no need for all the

1537
01:18:15,831 --> 01:18:19,280
human and biological reward systems that
are in place that made sure that we

1538
01:18:19,281 --> 01:18:19,790
survive.

1539
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:24,290
Whether it's ego or fear or emotions,
no need for that,

1540
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:29,320
that it will just exist and maintain its
equilibrium as this new form of life and

1541
01:18:32,091 --> 01:18:35,630
that this is the future of life in the
universe and that will get there.

1542
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:38,180
Maybe it'll only be 100,
200 years from now,

1543
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,100
but that,
that that's what exists all throughout

1544
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:42,230
the cosmos.
So there's no need to peacock.

1545
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:47,470
There's no need to show our sand on the
sky and that it just exists in this

1546
01:18:47,631 --> 01:18:48,464
form.
Yeah,

1547
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:50,240
I,
I agree.

1548
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,250
I wouldn't be surprised.
Yeah.

1549
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:56,810
So that's the,
that's the counter argument to the Fermi

1550
01:18:56,811 --> 01:18:59,560
paradox argument that I talked about
what a,

1551
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:02,960
exactly as you've just said,
that basically you evolved to a point

1552
01:19:02,961 --> 01:19:07,070
very rapidly where you just don't create
a signature and you don't really get

1553
01:19:07,071 --> 01:19:11,020
involved as you said.
Maybe it just maintains,

1554
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:12,830
but it has no.

1555
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:14,690
Well,
there's no motivation,

1556
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,260
right?
Like,

1557
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:18,050
it doesn't.
Our motivations are so weird,

1558
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,550
right?
We have these biological motivations to

1559
01:19:20,551 --> 01:19:22,370
survive and uh,
you know,

1560
01:19:22,371 --> 01:19:26,210
there's motivation is to conquer and to
innovate and to spread our genes and to

1561
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:30,020
move into new territories.
But if you didn't have biology,

1562
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:34,520
if you were,
you existed completely from manmade

1563
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:38,750
materials or from materials found on
earth and that this new form of life is

1564
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,640
created out of that.
I wouldn't have those unless you program

1565
01:19:41,641 --> 01:19:43,520
them.
And why would you do that?

1566
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:45,020
It is interesting,
isn't it,

1567
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:48,350
to two because we don't know what
consciousness is.

1568
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:51,410
It's often called the hard problem in
science.

1569
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:55,100
We don't know.
So it's a good question whether you can

1570
01:19:55,101 --> 01:19:56,990
build,
let's say you want to build a self

1571
01:19:56,991 --> 01:19:59,660
replicating machine,
which is what you're talking about,

1572
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:04,430
something that can go and maybe go to
the moon or Mars and replicates itself

1573
01:20:04,431 --> 01:20:06,620
and then carry on,
which is a living thing.

1574
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:07,800
I,
yes,

1575
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,660
does he have to have a sufficient level
of intelligence that he actually is

1576
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:15,750
conscious and all these things that we
talked about,

1577
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:17,760
this,
this word meaning that we used earlier

1578
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:20,130
that we all understand that you can't
define,

1579
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:25,550
is that a emergent property that,
that has to emerge if you've got

1580
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:31,401
something that's intelligent enough to
replicate itself and live and said to be

1581
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,500
the,
I don't know the answer,

1582
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:38,040
but it is worth considering that this
thing,

1583
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:43,070
this what we emotion meaning love and
fear and all those things are just the

1584
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:46,410
things that happen when you are
intelligent.

1585
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:50,160
I don't know the answer to that,
but it could possibly be.

1586
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:53,800
And does consciousness have to have our,
uh,

1587
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:57,060
local origin?
Like it doesn't have to come from a

1588
01:20:57,061 --> 01:21:00,510
thing.
Like if you think about cellular

1589
01:21:00,511 --> 01:21:01,820
communication,
the,

1590
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:04,710
if you send me,
if you're in England and you send me a

1591
01:21:04,711 --> 01:21:07,170
video from your phone and it reaches my
phone,

1592
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,900
it's getting to meet through space.

1593
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:14,370
It's going through the sky.
It's like literally from a device not

1594
01:21:14,371 --> 01:21:18,740
connected by any wires or anything.
It's coming to me if,

1595
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:23,800
if there's a possibility to create some
sort of global intelligence through

1596
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:29,330
electronics that's nonlocal.
If one piece of it falls off this same

1597
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:32,250
is it just repairs itself or figures
itself out,

1598
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:37,430
but it's the same consciousness existing
on a global scale through some sort of

1599
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:39,970
an electronic network that instead of
the.

1600
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,090
The idea that you and I have that Brian
and Joe are,

1601
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:45,500
you have your mind.
I have my mind and we,

1602
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:49,410
we exist as intelligent being separate
from each other,

1603
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:53,520
but instead of that,
that all of it is connected and that all

1604
01:21:53,521 --> 01:21:58,521
of it is something that we can't even
conceive of because our brains are too

1605
01:21:59,071 --> 01:22:01,500
crude.
Like trying to explain to,

1606
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:02,960
you know,
Australia Pithy,

1607
01:22:02,961 --> 01:22:04,920
kiss what a satellite is.

1608
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,660
Yeah,
I mean I,

1609
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:09,690
yeah.
So many of you think about our brains,

1610
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,850
they are ultimately,
what are they?

1611
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:16,790
They're just a distributed network of
cells connected by neurons and they're

1612
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,460
very complicated,
but they are a colony of things that are

1613
01:22:20,461 --> 01:22:22,980
autonomous in a sense and the
communicating with each other.

1614
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:24,060
So yeah,
I don't,

1615
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:27,090
I don't see why you can't scale that up
in principle.

1616
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,430
I mean,
I should just add the caveat is always

1617
01:22:29,431 --> 01:22:33,720
that we don't know this.
It's just not understood.

1618
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:35,730
Well,
I think there's something weird

1619
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:37,890
physical,
but I'm damn sure it's physical.

1620
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:43,220
I'm damn sure that there's nothing going
on in my head other than what is allowed

1621
01:22:43,771 --> 01:22:45,600
by the laws of nature as we understand
them.

1622
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:50,580
So eliminating show,
you mean the idea of a soul being some

1623
01:22:50,581 --> 01:22:54,090
sort of a divine thing that's inside the
housing of the body?

1624
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:54,751
Yeah,
I mean,

1625
01:22:54,751 --> 01:22:55,470
I,
I,

1626
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,720
I would say we can rule that out
actually.

1627
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,300
I've argued in the past.
How do you rule it out?

1628
01:23:00,301 --> 01:23:03,330
I valued,
we can rule that out in the following

1629
01:23:03,331 --> 01:23:04,850
manner.
So,

1630
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:05,890
so here's my arm,
right?

1631
01:23:05,891 --> 01:23:05,980
So

1632
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,050
it's made of electrons and protons and
neutrons.

1633
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:08,861
And,
uh,

1634
01:23:08,861 --> 01:23:10,960
if uh,
if I have a soul in the,

1635
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,600
something that we don't understand,
but it's a different kind of energy or

1636
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:17,170
whatever it is we don't have in physics
at the moment,

1637
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:20,890
it interacts with matter because I'm
moving my hand around.

1638
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:25,870
So whatever it is,
it something that interact very strongly

1639
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:29,290
with matter.
But if you look at the history of

1640
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,930
particle physics in particular,
which is the study of matter,

1641
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,010
we spend,
we spent decades making high precision

1642
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:39,810
measurements of how massive behaves and
interacts and we look for,

1643
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:41,980
for example,
for a fifth force of nature.

1644
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:46,640
So we know for forces the gravity,
the two nuclear forces called the weak

1645
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:49,120
and strong nuclear forces and
electromagnetism.

1646
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:53,830
And that's what we know exist.
And we look for another one with ultra

1647
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:55,900
high precision and we don't see any
evidence of it.

1648
01:23:56,410 --> 01:24:01,410
So I would claim that we know how matter
interacts at these energies.

1649
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:04,800
So room temperature.
Now these,

1650
01:24:04,801 --> 01:24:06,820
Angie,
we know how matter interacts very

1651
01:24:06,821 --> 01:24:11,770
precisely and so if you want to suggest
the something else that interacts with

1652
01:24:11,771 --> 01:24:16,510
matter strongly,
then I would say that it's ruled out.

1653
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:20,190
I would go as far to say it's ruled out
by experiment or at least he sees

1654
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:24,430
extremely subtle and you would have to
jump through a lot of hoops to come up

1655
01:24:24,431 --> 01:24:29,080
with a theory of some stuff that we
wouldn't have seen when we've observed

1656
01:24:29,081 --> 01:24:34,081
how matter interacts that is present in
our bodies and presumably be believing

1657
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:37,060
the soul.
You want it to exist outside.

1658
01:24:37,061 --> 01:24:39,040
When you die,
you still want the thing to be there and

1659
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:41,110
you might believe in ghosts and things
like that.

1660
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:42,610
We like a ghost.
I mean it's a.

1661
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,920
It is something that carries the imprint
of you.

1662
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:49,920
Presumably it looks like you.
So that means that interact strongly

1663
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:52,510
with the matter.
That is you because it carries a

1664
01:24:52,511 --> 01:24:55,120
pattern.
It carries a pattern and it carries

1665
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:57,280
information.
It carries information.

1666
01:24:57,281 --> 01:25:00,250
There has to be an energy source that
allows the information to assist in the

1667
01:25:00,251 --> 01:25:01,480
pattern to persistence,
so on.

1668
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:05,350
So again,
you end up with a theory that is

1669
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:09,010
postulating.
Something interacts with light because

1670
01:25:09,011 --> 01:25:13,540
if you think a ghost is the soul,
then it's something that people see

1671
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:16,540
sometimes.
So that means it interacts with light.

1672
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:21,930
But we know how light interacts and we
ruled out anything but the most subtle,

1673
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,570
uh,
further interaction that we haven't

1674
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:26,590
seen.
So I would,

1675
01:25:26,591 --> 01:25:29,680
I claim that I started off as a joke,
but it's actually,

1676
01:25:29,681 --> 01:25:31,270
I wrote it in an infinite monkey cage
book,

1677
01:25:31,271 --> 01:25:33,820
this radio show that I do,
but he ended up,

1678
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:37,600
when I'd written it down,
I thought actually that it makes sense.

1679
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:38,950
And I read some news similar.
Actually,

1680
01:25:38,951 --> 01:25:40,600
I think I'm Sean Carroll.
Lee,

1681
01:25:40,601 --> 01:25:42,300
I don't know if you've had shown up a
couple times.

1682
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:46,030
He's said something the same.
I think in the book that he wrote the

1683
01:25:46,031 --> 01:25:47,950
big picture.
I think he has a similar argument

1684
01:25:47,951 --> 01:25:50,320
actually,
so it's occurred to him as well,

1685
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:54,220
is roughly the same argument.
So if you.

1686
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:57,910
So this energy that's interacting with
matter,

1687
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:02,380
even if you're not moving at all,
if you're just thinking it's interacting

1688
01:26:02,381 --> 01:26:03,980
with the matter encompasses your

1689
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,580
mind or your brain or your nerves and
your neurons.

1690
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:12,140
It's something in there that's
interacting with matter whether you like

1691
01:26:12,141 --> 01:26:15,200
it or not.
So even just a simple thought process or

1692
01:26:15,201 --> 01:26:18,920
a dream is still something it's
interacting with Matt.

1693
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:21,550
Yeah.
Well obviously because you know you,

1694
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:22,680
it's your will,
isn't it?

1695
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:27,290
When you move it's presumably,
but even if you're not moving the idea,

1696
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:30,170
like the year you're saying you're like
your body's interacting with batteries,

1697
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,300
you're moving your arm,
but even if you're not moving,

1698
01:26:32,301 --> 01:26:34,820
if you're just thinking and you're
completely still,

1699
01:26:34,821 --> 01:26:37,310
which is not totally possible because
your heart's beating and your breathing

1700
01:26:37,311 --> 01:26:40,640
and all that stuff,
but if somehow or another you were able

1701
01:26:40,641 --> 01:26:44,690
to isolate just the thought,
the thoughts themselves are still

1702
01:26:44,691 --> 01:26:48,170
interacting with matter because they're
interacting with the brain itself.

1703
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:48,940
Yeah.

1704
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:51,760
So there's something in there that's
something to interact with the physical

1705
01:26:51,761 --> 01:26:54,850
structure of your body.
And and now I would say there isn't.

1706
01:26:57,370 --> 01:26:58,990
So that's

1707
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:04,200
the woo woo version is that the brain
itself and the body of the physical,

1708
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:10,510
the spiritual self,
you are merely an antenna that's tuning

1709
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:14,980
in to the great consciousness of the
universe.

1710
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:19,230
But why?
But then you have to answer what we

1711
01:27:19,231 --> 01:27:20,370
know,
what we're made of.

1712
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:23,310
So we know how those particles behave
and interact.

1713
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:28,590
So.
So why did the particles not a in any

1714
01:27:28,591 --> 01:27:30,990
way interact with that stuff?
Because we interact,

1715
01:27:30,991 --> 01:27:34,560
we don't know if that's true.
We don't only just interact with it,

1716
01:27:34,561 --> 01:27:37,050
so we interact extremely strongly with
it.

1717
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,460
We're interacting with it now.
Yeah.

1718
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,720
Every movement I make is the interaction
between that.

1719
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:44,970
Every man have.
Yeah.

1720
01:27:45,150 --> 01:27:46,110
Yes.
When everything.

1721
01:27:46,111 --> 01:27:50,220
If I moved my fingers or everything that
I'm doing is an interaction between that

1722
01:27:50,221 --> 01:27:53,370
stuff and me,
so it's a very strong interaction with

1723
01:27:53,371 --> 01:27:56,760
matter,
but we don't see it in all our precision

1724
01:27:56,761 --> 01:27:58,300
measurements.
Well,

1725
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:00,540
the answer for that,
the answer is because it's not there.

1726
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,210
The answer is Jesus and you can't
measure God.

1727
01:28:04,230 --> 01:28:08,250
That may be an answer,
but the point is you as we'd sell it for

1728
01:28:08,251 --> 01:28:11,340
earlier with absolute space,
if you can't measure it,

1729
01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:15,510
it's not there.
Right?

1730
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:17,150
It's,

1731
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:18,740
but for,
for whatever reason,

1732
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:22,880
for people,
there is some incredible motivation to

1733
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:27,910
find a divine something or another
that's there's something greater than

1734
01:28:30,741 --> 01:28:33,350
this physical being that there's
something.

1735
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:35,840
What do you think that is?
Like what is that compulsion?

1736
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:38,360
We.
We've already talked a bit of balance

1737
01:28:38,361 --> 01:28:42,350
it.
I think it goes to the the heart of this

1738
01:28:42,351 --> 01:28:47,351
question of what it means to be human.
So I would say that being human,

1739
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:53,660
the answer to that,
I don't know the answer to the meaning

1740
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:56,390
grid,
but the answer would be,

1741
01:28:56,860 --> 01:29:01,860
uh,
we are small finite beings,

1742
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,830
right?
Which are just clusters of atoms as we

1743
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:06,240
said before,
a very rare,

1744
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:10,080
but we understand roughly how they,
how they came to be,

1745
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:15,240
and we have a limited amount of time,
not actually unfortunately,

1746
01:29:15,241 --> 01:29:20,241
but because of the laws of nature,
the laws of nature for bidders to be

1747
01:29:20,431 --> 01:29:21,400
immortal,
they,

1748
01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:21,931
they,
they,

1749
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:25,830
they a mortalities ruled out by the laws
of physics,

1750
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:30,510
but also actually what is it?
What's interesting about if you look at

1751
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:34,560
the basic physics of the universe going
from the Big Bang to where we are today,

1752
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:40,280
then the physics is driven by the fact
that the universe began in extremely old

1753
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:45,980
state because it was a very highly
ordered system and it is tending towards

1754
01:29:46,741 --> 01:29:49,980
a more disordered system at the moment
and that's called the second law of

1755
01:29:49,981 --> 01:29:50,850
thermodynamics.

1756
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,450
And it's that basic common sense thing
that things go to shit.

1757
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,150
Basically it's the second law of
thermodynamics.

1758
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:02,230
What we strongly suspect,
and I would say no,

1759
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:08,010
is that in that process of going from
order to disorder,

1760
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:12,930
complexity emerges naturally for a brief
period of time,

1761
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:18,210
so it's a natural part of the evolution
of the universe that you get a period in

1762
01:30:18,211 --> 01:30:20,220
time when there's complexity in the
universe,

1763
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:24,690
stars and planets and galaxies and life
and civilizations,

1764
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:28,350
but they are.
They exist because the universe is

1765
01:30:28,351 --> 01:30:31,140
decaying,
not in spite of the fact the universe is

1766
01:30:31,141 --> 01:30:35,460
decaying,
so our existence in that sort of picture

1767
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:39,480
is necessarily finite,
unnecessarily time limited,

1768
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:45,030
and it is a remarkable thing that that
complexity has got so far that there are

1769
01:30:45,031 --> 01:30:48,210
things in the universe that can think
and feel and explore it,

1770
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:52,380
and I think that is the answer.
If you want an answer to the meaning of

1771
01:30:52,381 --> 01:30:53,560
it all,
it's that,

1772
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:58,140
that you are part of the universe
because of the way the laws of nature

1773
01:30:58,141 --> 01:31:00,750
work.
You are allowed to exist,

1774
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:05,450
but you're allowed to exist for
temporary for a small amount of time in

1775
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,990
a possibly infinite universe.

1776
01:31:07,810 --> 01:31:11,770
One of the biggest mind blowing moments,
I think,

1777
01:31:11,771 --> 01:31:16,771
of my limited comprehension of what it
means to be a living being was when I

1778
01:31:16,931 --> 01:31:21,931
found out that carbon and all the stuff
that makes us has to come out of a dying

1779
01:31:23,501 --> 01:31:25,840
star,
like that alone,

1780
01:31:25,841 --> 01:31:30,841
that there's this very strange cycle of
these enormous fireballs that forge the

1781
01:31:34,031 --> 01:31:39,031
material that makes Brian Cox like what?
That,

1782
01:31:39,071 --> 01:31:44,071
that one alone that there is some
strange loop of of,

1783
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:50,060
of biological life that comes from
stars,

1784
01:31:50,561 --> 01:31:53,350
which is like the most elemental thing
that we can observe.

1785
01:31:53,351 --> 01:31:56,410
We see these things in the school.
You see the sun in the sky.

1786
01:31:56,411 --> 01:32:00,100
It's this all powerful ball fire and

1787
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:05,100
that that is where the building blocks
for a person come from and they will be

1788
01:32:06,491 --> 01:32:08,980
from the carbon atoms in our body that
you're right.

1789
01:32:08,981 --> 01:32:13,210
They all got made in stars because there
was just none of it at the big bang.

1790
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:17,620
There's only hydrogen and helium tiny
bit lithium to be precise but nothing

1791
01:32:17,621 --> 01:32:20,740
else,
and so it was all made in stars and it's

1792
01:32:20,741 --> 01:32:23,380
probably from different styles.
You know the acids in your body.

1793
01:32:23,381 --> 01:32:25,810
They're not all from one star that
cooked it and then died.

1794
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:30,100
There'll be a mixture of stuff for many
styles in your body now,

1795
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:33,280
and I agree with you.
The what more do you want?

1796
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:33,850
You know,
when,

1797
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:36,640
when I see people go,
I want more than that.

1798
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:37,650
I wouldn't.
Yeah,

1799
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:38,920
it must.
There must be more to it.

1800
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:40,680
What do you mean the,
the,

1801
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:41,820
the we,
we had,

1802
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:46,210
we were the ingredients now voltage were
assembled in the hearts of long dead

1803
01:32:46,211 --> 01:32:50,940
stars over billions of years and they've
assembled themselves spontaneously into

1804
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:55,780
temporary structures that can think and
feel and explore and then their

1805
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:58,090
structures will decay away again at some
point,

1806
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,760
and in the very far future there'll be
no structures left.

1807
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:01,930
So.
So there we are.

1808
01:33:01,931 --> 01:33:06,100
We exist in this little window when we
can observe this magnificent universe.

1809
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:09,670
Why do you want any more?
I think too,

1810
01:33:09,671 --> 01:33:12,310
people will.
I think a lot of people aren't aware of

1811
01:33:12,311 --> 01:33:14,260
all the,
all the information,

1812
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,210
right?
And then I think on top of it,

1813
01:33:16,211 --> 01:33:21,211
for some people it's just,
it's so overwhelming this,

1814
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:26,980
this concept of 13 point 8 billion years
of everything to get to this point that

1815
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,940
we're at right now.
It's so overwhelming that they want to

1816
01:33:30,941 --> 01:33:35,320
simplify it and want to put it into some
sort of a fable structure.

1817
01:33:35,650 --> 01:33:40,650
Something where it's something that's
very common and similar and familiar.

1818
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:42,401
Yeah.
I,

1819
01:33:42,401 --> 01:33:44,110
I,
I agree.

1820
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:44,820
Um,
and,

1821
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:48,430
but I think that's the,
the is the,

1822
01:33:48,431 --> 01:33:50,480
the,
the journey that we go on,

1823
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:55,510
the real treasure.
I think it is in that journey of trying

1824
01:33:55,511 --> 01:33:57,220
to face the incomprehensible.

1825
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:02,140
It's in that realization that it's
almost,

1826
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:06,460
it's almost impossible to believe that
we exist.

1827
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:08,010
Right.
That's,

1828
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:10,090
that's,
that's a wonderful thing.

1829
01:34:10,091 --> 01:34:12,740
Yeah.
And I think that that's what I think you

1830
01:34:12,741 --> 01:34:15,470
miss out.
I think if you decide to simplify it

1831
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:18,790
because you don't want to face that,
you don't want to face the infinity

1832
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:23,770
that's out there in front of us and you
don't want to face those stories as you

1833
01:34:23,771 --> 01:34:26,170
said,
that you look at your finger and it's

1834
01:34:26,171 --> 01:34:30,430
ingredients cooked in multiple styles
over billions of years.

1835
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:32,380
That that's a.
to me,

1836
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:35,560
it's a joyous and powerful thing to
think about.

1837
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:37,930
Yes,
and I think you're missing out if you

1838
01:34:37,931 --> 01:34:40,870
don't want to face that.
Why I think the distribution of

1839
01:34:40,871 --> 01:34:44,260
information has changed so radically
over the last couple of hundred years

1840
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:49,060
and particularly over the last 20 that
you're seeing these trends now or more

1841
01:34:49,061 --> 01:34:54,061
people are inclined to abandon a lot of
the.

1842
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:59,610
Even if you remain religious remain you.
You keep a a thought or a belief in a

1843
01:35:01,551 --> 01:35:06,290
higher power.
People are more inclined to entertain

1844
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:11,291
these concepts of science and to take in
the understanding of what has been

1845
01:35:11,601 --> 01:35:16,601
observed and documented and written
about amongst scholars and academics and

1846
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:20,150
there's more.
There's more people accepting that.

1847
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:23,610
Have you looked at the number of
agnostic people now as opposed to 20,

1848
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:24,600
30 years ago?
It's,

1849
01:35:24,601 --> 01:35:25,760
it's,
it's rising,

1850
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:30,020
it's changing and I think there's also
because of you and because of Neil

1851
01:35:30,021 --> 01:35:34,520
degrasse Tyson and Sean Carroll and all
these other people that are public

1852
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:36,380
intellectuals that are discussing this
kind of stuff,

1853
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:41,000
people like myself have a far greater
understanding of this than I think

1854
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:44,120
people did 30,
40 years ago and that trend is

1855
01:35:44,121 --> 01:35:46,520
continuing,
I think in a very good direction.

1856
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:47,613
Yeah,
I mean,

1857
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:52,880
you know,
well we should say is that science,

1858
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:56,150
we don't know all the emphasis,
so we don't know where the laws of

1859
01:35:56,151 --> 01:35:57,080
nature came from.

1860
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:02,680
We don't know why the universe began and
the way that it did if indeed at the

1861
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:06,020
beginning,
so it doesn't know why the Big Bang was

1862
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:07,780
very,
very highly olded,

1863
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:11,380
which is ultimately a show.
And Carol actually you mentioned him

1864
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:14,740
often points out it means right,
that they.

1865
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:18,510
The whole difference.
The only difference between the past and

1866
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:21,890
the future so-called called Arrow of
time is that in the past the universe

1867
01:36:21,891 --> 01:36:26,450
was really old and it's getting more
disordered and that's that,

1868
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:30,530
that,
that necessary state of older,

1869
01:36:30,531 --> 01:36:33,650
at the start of the universe,
which is really the reason that we

1870
01:36:33,651 --> 01:36:35,930
exist.
That's the reason cause the universe

1871
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:40,931
began in a particular form.
We don't know why that was so we,

1872
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:43,880
we,
we will probably find out at some point

1873
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:46,130
and it'll be something to do with the
laws of nature,

1874
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,770
but so I'm always careful.
I don't want to.

1875
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,640
Science can sometimes sound arrogant,
right?

1876
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:55,500
It can sometimes sound like it's the,
it's the discipline of saying to people

1877
01:36:55,501 --> 01:36:56,334
where you're not.
Right,

1878
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:59,470
and it's not the discipline of saying
you are not right.

1879
01:36:59,471 --> 01:37:02,440
It's saying this is what we found out.
Yeah.

1880
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:03,274
So it.
I,

1881
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:07,940
I liked to say that it provides a
framework within which if you want to

1882
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:11,440
philosophize or you want to do theology
or you want to,

1883
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:14,660
you want to ask these deep questions
about why we're here.

1884
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:17,390
You have to operate within that
framework because it's just an

1885
01:37:17,391 --> 01:37:21,410
observational framework.
So everything we've said is stuff we've

1886
01:37:21,411 --> 01:37:24,080
discovered,
it's not stuff that someone made up,

1887
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:25,243
right?
We,

1888
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:26,211
we,
we,

1889
01:37:26,211 --> 01:37:27,700
you know,
we understand nuclear physics,

1890
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:29,600
we can build nuclear reactors for
example,

1891
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:34,640
so we understand the physics of stars.
So we understand that the styles built

1892
01:37:34,641 --> 01:37:38,800
the carbon and oxygen and we know how
they did it and we can see it because as

1893
01:37:38,801 --> 01:37:39,680
I said before,
we can,

1894
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:43,940
if you look far out into the universe,
you're looking way back in time and as

1895
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:47,510
you look back in time,
you see less carbon and less oxygen.

1896
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:52,220
So we have a direct observation that in
the earliest universe there wasn't any

1897
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:56,040
because we can see it and now we see
that there is some and we

1898
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,350
know how it was made.
So I think it's so.

1899
01:37:58,351 --> 01:38:03,351
It's important to be humble when you're
talking about science and you're not

1900
01:38:04,141 --> 01:38:07,920
saying this is the way that it is.
I mean you are in a sense,

1901
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:12,660
but it's not.
It's not able to answer ultimate

1902
01:38:12,661 --> 01:38:17,040
questions at the moment is not able to
answer even whether the universe had a

1903
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:19,170
beginning or not.
We don't even know that.

1904
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,030
And I gave it to,
um,

1905
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:26,130
I was asked to give a talk to some
bishops in the UK about cosmology and I

1906
01:38:26,131 --> 01:38:26,401
said,
yeah,

1907
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:29,820
that'd be great fun.
And so I went and I gave him this talk

1908
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:30,231
and,
and,

1909
01:38:30,231 --> 01:38:32,520
and at the end I said,
I've got some questions.

1910
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:35,880
So if the universe is eternal and it
might be,

1911
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:39,570
it might not have had the beginning.
If it's eternal,

1912
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:42,340
what place is there for a creator?
You know,

1913
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:44,010
that's,
that's a good question.

1914
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:46,680
We didn't,
they didn't have an answer of course and

1915
01:38:46,681 --> 01:38:48,450
eternal creator,
but yet.

1916
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:52,200
But I think that these,
it might be eternal and we might

1917
01:38:52,201 --> 01:38:53,860
discover that.
So we don't,

1918
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:55,200
we don't know at the moment,
but we might.

1919
01:38:55,650 --> 01:39:00,570
So I think my point is that these other
human,

1920
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:04,920
a decisive,
very natural to religions and natural

1921
01:39:04,921 --> 01:39:05,371
thing,
right?

1922
01:39:05,371 --> 01:39:07,890
People you see all across the world and
all different cultures.

1923
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:13,520
But I think that in the 21st century it
religion needs to operate within that

1924
01:39:14,401 --> 01:39:15,990
framework.
If it's going,

1925
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:20,100
it's going to operate.
There are still great mysteries and it

1926
01:39:20,101 --> 01:39:23,490
is appropriate to think about what it
means to be human and are giving you my

1927
01:39:23,550 --> 01:39:25,470
view of what it means,
but,

1928
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:28,530
but I don't think the problem comes when
you,

1929
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:33,560
when you're your theology or your
philosophy forces you to deny some

1930
01:39:34,110 --> 01:39:35,820
facts,
some measurement.

1931
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:38,940
Now these things that measurements,
we were not saying,

1932
01:39:38,941 --> 01:39:39,810
it's not my opinion.

1933
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:41,820
The Universe is 13 point 8 billion years
old.

1934
01:39:41,821 --> 01:39:44,280
We measured it.
It's like having an opinion between the

1935
01:39:44,281 --> 01:39:47,560
distance from La to New York that you
can't have an opinion on that.

1936
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:53,040
What it is and it's the same decided
that the three things you notice is that

1937
01:39:53,221 --> 01:39:54,870
people say the earth is flat or whatever
that is,

1938
01:39:54,871 --> 01:39:57,630
or it isn't,
and we've measured it so it's just stop

1939
01:39:57,631 --> 01:39:58,411
it,
you know,

1940
01:39:58,411 --> 01:39:59,940
so,
but that doesn't mean you can't be

1941
01:39:59,941 --> 01:40:04,470
spiritual and you can't be really just,
I would say it doesn't mean you can't

1942
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:09,800
believe in God or gods or a date that's
not ruled out by signs,

1943
01:40:10,530 --> 01:40:12,480
but some stuff's ruled out.

1944
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:17,100
I love the way you communicate this
because it takes into consideration

1945
01:40:17,101 --> 01:40:18,990
human nature.
And like,

1946
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:21,510
I love Dawkins,
he's fantastic,

1947
01:40:21,511 --> 01:40:22,560
I think he's very,
very,

1948
01:40:22,561 --> 01:40:25,800
very valuable,
but he likes to call people idiots.

1949
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,830
And the problem with that is people go,
fuck you.

1950
01:40:28,831 --> 01:40:32,730
You're an idiot.
Like is a natural inclination when you

1951
01:40:32,731 --> 01:40:37,731
insult people to argue back and to sort
of dig their heels in and uh,

1952
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:42,390
you don't do that.
And I think that's very important and I

1953
01:40:42,391 --> 01:40:46,200
think that a guy like doc has just gets
frustrated from all these years of

1954
01:40:46,201 --> 01:40:49,710
debates with people who are uneducated
or saying ridiculous things and he's a

1955
01:40:49,711 --> 01:40:51,130
bit of a curmudgeon,
you know,

1956
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:53,290
when he seems to be softening as he's
getting older.

1957
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,170
He's an evolutionary

1958
01:40:54,170 --> 01:40:55,390
biologist.
That's the,

1959
01:40:55,391 --> 01:40:57,510
the front line in some sense,
isn't it?

1960
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:58,413
Yes,
it is.

1961
01:40:58,730 --> 01:41:01,720
To think about particle physics is that
you don't get a lot of shit because

1962
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:03,530
people don't understand what you're
talking about.

1963
01:41:05,410 --> 01:41:09,760
Evolutionary biology is right there.
So I understand his frustration.

1964
01:41:09,790 --> 01:41:10,630
Oh,
I do too.

1965
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:12,610
Having said that,
you know,

1966
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:17,320
I've kind of softened a bit over the
years actually because now I think at

1967
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:20,560
this point,
both in the US actually and in Britain

1968
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:25,360
and in some of the countries we are a,
an a point you've sort of alluded to it

1969
01:41:25,361 --> 01:41:29,200
where everybody's angry with a lot of
anger and a lot of it's justified by the

1970
01:41:29,201 --> 01:41:30,640
way you maybe we could talk about that,
you know,

1971
01:41:30,641 --> 01:41:33,910
income inequality and all those things,
so it's justified anger.

1972
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:39,190
But it seems to me that there are people
of goodwill who need to band together to

1973
01:41:39,191 --> 01:41:40,240
diffuse the anger.

1974
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:44,470
Now Society's otherwise we won't have
countries like the United States is the

1975
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:47,190
United States because it's united and
everybody and you've got the United

1976
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:48,340
States,
the American flag there.

1977
01:41:48,341 --> 01:41:50,800
You know,
that there's a sense of belonging and

1978
01:41:50,801 --> 01:41:53,950
identity and togetherness in a country
in which you've got to preserve.

1979
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:57,700
And so I've stopped.
Actually I'm picking.

1980
01:41:57,730 --> 01:41:58,900
I used to,
for example,

1981
01:41:58,901 --> 01:42:03,901
quite enjoy picking fights with Deepak
Chopra on twitter and it's just fun to

1982
01:42:04,031 --> 01:42:04,770
laugh,
you know,

1983
01:42:04,770 --> 01:42:08,290
I need to do
some crazy stuff and he's not.

1984
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,930
But I've almost,
I've stopped doing it going well,

1985
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:14,290
but relative to some of the other
people,

1986
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:16,270
it is a,
he's a,

1987
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:19,360
he's,
he's someone who means he means well,

1988
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:21,760
I don't agree with virtually anything he
says.

1989
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:25,420
However,
he's a well meaning person and so I've

1990
01:42:25,421 --> 01:42:27,670
started trying to seek common ground
now.

1991
01:42:27,671 --> 01:42:30,370
That's why I get,
for example,

1992
01:42:30,371 --> 01:42:32,290
gave a talk to the Bishop,
asked me to come here.

1993
01:42:32,290 --> 01:42:35,440
I don't agree with them on the
framework,

1994
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:38,020
their theological framework,
but they mean well,

1995
01:42:38,021 --> 01:42:39,130
most of them.
Yeah.

1996
01:42:39,131 --> 01:42:43,180
So I think seeking consensus and
defeating anger as you said,

1997
01:42:43,181 --> 01:42:45,280
is it,
it is incumbent on all of us,

1998
01:42:45,281 --> 01:42:47,530
especially people like us who have a
public voice.

1999
01:42:47,950 --> 01:42:51,400
We need to diffuse some of this anger
because otherwise it will consume

2000
01:42:51,401 --> 01:42:52,690
everyone.
Yes.

2001
01:42:52,691 --> 01:42:56,260
I've,
I've tried very hard to evolve in that

2002
01:42:56,261 --> 01:42:59,470
respect and just get better at
communicating ideas and get better at

2003
01:42:59,471 --> 01:43:01,630
understanding how people receive those
ideas.

2004
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:06,930
And I think that's why it's easy to get
lazy and consult and to.

2005
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:09,710
Yeah,
it's fine.

2006
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,740
It's fun.
Especially me.

2007
01:43:11,741 --> 01:43:14,650
I mean I'm a comedian as well.
What I do is insult people,

2008
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:20,050
but for humor,
I want to entertain people.

2009
01:43:20,051 --> 01:43:23,800
That's the whole idea behind it,
but I think in terms of like discussing

2010
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:27,190
ideas especially that are so personal to
people like religion.

2011
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:28,210
I've,
I've,

2012
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:31,360
uh,
I've reexamined the way I interpret

2013
01:43:31,361 --> 01:43:33,910
these ideas and the way I talk about
these things.

2014
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:35,440
Yeah,
there's a,

2015
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,630
it's interesting.
There's A.

2016
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:42,110
I did a BBC program at age 10.
I was asked to do it on the single reith

2017
01:43:42,130 --> 01:43:46,630
lectures at the BBC.
The BBC had done it is 9:52,

2018
01:43:46,631 --> 01:43:50,590
I think it was.
Then Robert Oppenheimer did them in 53,

2019
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:51,980
I think it was.

2020
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,290
It's fascinating.
You can get the transcripts online.

2021
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:58,100
They're free and you can get one
recording of the five they taped over

2022
01:43:58,101 --> 01:43:59,450
the other four.
Can you believe it?

2023
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:02,890
Why they raised them?
Because they wanted to tape something

2024
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:06,400
believable,
but one of them existed oftentimes are

2025
01:44:06,401 --> 01:44:08,390
giving these lectures.
Oh my God.

2026
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:14,260
But you can read it just from Katie and
bedroom.

2027
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:17,560
Wrestled him.
The types over them.

2028
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:22,550
Don't read Bertrand Russell's
[inaudible] tape is so expensive,

2029
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:26,870
but he talks crazy,
but he's brilliant.

2030
01:44:26,871 --> 01:44:30,140
It's called science in the common
understanding and they weren't very well

2031
01:44:30,141 --> 01:44:32,750
received because he thought he was going
to talk about the Manhattan project,

2032
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:34,450
so they thought he was going to talk
about the atom bomb,

2033
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:35,990
you know,
because he was.

2034
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:38,210
He ran it basically,
but he didn't.

2035
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:41,390
He talks about how thinking like a
scientist,

2036
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:46,790
which means thinking in the way that
nature forces you to think can be

2037
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:48,020
valuable in other areas.

2038
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:50,420
And it's a.
that's an insight in itself.

2039
01:44:50,421 --> 01:44:53,400
The great thing,
the unique thing about science,

2040
01:44:53,401 --> 01:44:56,090
there's nature forces you to think like
that.

2041
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:58,970
You can't have an opinion.
Can I have an opinion about gravity

2042
01:44:59,670 --> 01:45:01,670
region with building.
You can hit the ground.

2043
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:03,950
That's it.
It doesn't matter what your opinion is.

2044
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:05,750
And,
and he said,

2045
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,850
so if you think about,
for example,

2046
01:45:07,851 --> 01:45:11,930
quantum mechanics,
so sometimes you think of as particles

2047
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:13,730
electron,
sometimes it has to.

2048
01:45:13,731 --> 01:45:16,970
It's a point like object may behave like
a little billy,

2049
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:19,370
a ball thing.
The pool ball bands is around,

2050
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,220
but sometimes it behaves like an
extended thing,

2051
01:45:22,221 --> 01:45:26,870
like a wavy thing and nature forces you
to hold both ideas in your head at the

2052
01:45:26,871 --> 01:45:31,070
same time in order to get a complete
picture of the object,

2053
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:34,940
the description of an electron.
And he said that's the valuable thing

2054
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:35,990
about quantum mechanics.

2055
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:38,000
You know,
unless you're doing electronics or

2056
01:45:38,001 --> 01:45:40,640
inventing lasers and you don't need to
know this stuff,

2057
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:43,400
but if you want to learn how to think
you,

2058
01:45:43,450 --> 01:45:46,940
it's valuable to be forced to hold
different ideas in your head.

2059
01:45:46,941 --> 01:45:49,520
At the same time.
It's really teaching you not to be an

2060
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:54,350
absolutist straight teaching you the
example he uses his because he was.

2061
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:56,690
I think he was,
had problems with mccarthy and all those

2062
01:45:56,691 --> 01:45:58,260
things.
Didn't he say you think he's still.

2063
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:00,680
He's writing in the fifties.
So he said you can either be,

2064
01:46:00,770 --> 01:46:04,610
you can be a communist,
which in his definition would be that

2065
01:46:04,611 --> 01:46:07,520
you think the needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few.

2066
01:46:07,521 --> 01:46:09,260
Right.
So say societies,

2067
01:46:09,261 --> 01:46:11,810
all that matters.
Or it could be a libertarian or right on

2068
01:46:11,811 --> 01:46:15,740
the far conservative and where you think
that the individual is the only thing

2069
01:46:15,741 --> 01:46:18,890
that matters and that's it,
but actually of course,

2070
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:22,760
to have a functioning society,
you need a mixture of the two and we can

2071
01:46:22,761 --> 01:46:26,270
wait it one way or the other,
but you need to hold both ideas in your

2072
01:46:26,271 --> 01:46:29,450
head at the same time.
And that's he said that one of the most

2073
01:46:29,451 --> 01:46:33,920
valuable things about science because it
forces you into modes of thought that

2074
01:46:33,921 --> 01:46:36,160
are valuable.
And that's what we're talking about here

2075
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:39,830
is I'm an absolute.
Physicians are always,

2076
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:41,113
uh,
uh,

2077
01:46:41,230 --> 01:46:41,930
uh,
just a,

2078
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:44,930
a blinkered sort of subsets of what's
actually happening.

2079
01:46:44,931 --> 01:46:48,590
You can't understand the world by being
an extremist.

2080
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,160
You've got to hold

2081
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:55,160
all these views in your head.
Well that I find that so often on this

2082
01:46:55,771 --> 01:46:59,760
podcast because I talk with people I
agree with and disagree with and I

2083
01:46:59,761 --> 01:47:03,360
always try to put myself in the head of
the person that I disagree with.

2084
01:47:03,361 --> 01:47:08,361
I will always try to figure out how
they're coming to those conclusions are,

2085
01:47:08,581 --> 01:47:11,520
where they're coming from.
And I think it's so,

2086
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:14,610
it's so important to not be married to
ideas.

2087
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:19,470
I got a conversation with someone about
this and they said sometimes you change

2088
01:47:19,471 --> 01:47:20,610
your opinions a lot.
I go,

2089
01:47:20,611 --> 01:47:21,540
yeah,
I do.

2090
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:23,680
I do.
Because if it's a bad thing,

2091
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:27,120
like I'm flip flopping.
I'm not a politician,

2092
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:29,040
I'm not flip flopping.
I'm thinking,

2093
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,480
yeah,
I'm not sure.

2094
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:31,880
I'm not sure.
Like I,

2095
01:47:31,881 --> 01:47:35,760
I will have one opinion on a thing,
whether it's a controversial thing like

2096
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:38,730
universal basic income and I'll change
my mind 100 percent,

2097
01:47:38,770 --> 01:47:41,160
two weeks,
I'll go there and now I think it's

2098
01:47:41,161 --> 01:47:41,994
probably a good idea.

2099
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,370
And then I'll go back and forth.
No,

2100
01:47:44,371 --> 01:47:44,821
no,
no,

2101
01:47:44,821 --> 01:47:45,151
no,
no.

2102
01:47:45,151 --> 01:47:48,060
People need eight is cruel as it seems.
They need motivation.

2103
01:47:48,061 --> 01:47:49,620
They need.
And I don't know,

2104
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:51,590
I bounced around with these things.
Yeah.

2105
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:55,920
But I've tried really hard as I've
gotten older to have less absolute

2106
01:47:55,921 --> 01:47:56,800
opinions.
Yeah.

2107
01:47:57,330 --> 01:47:59,370
Yeah.
If Richard fineman another great

2108
01:47:59,371 --> 01:48:03,440
physicist or a similar,
a similar time to open timer.

2109
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:06,420
And he also went to the Manhattan
project and it's called the value of

2110
01:48:06,421 --> 01:48:08,310
science.
I think that was 1955.

2111
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,470
And they both shared,
actually a,

2112
01:48:11,130 --> 01:48:12,510
a,
a surprise,

2113
01:48:12,511 --> 01:48:14,730
I think,
that they were still alive because I

2114
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:17,130
thought that the power they'd given to
the politicians,

2115
01:48:17,131 --> 01:48:21,240
the atom bomb would destroy everything
they didn't think that political system

2116
01:48:21,241 --> 01:48:22,380
would control it.
And it did.

2117
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:24,510
So that's an emergency.
Malcolm will thing.

2118
01:48:24,930 --> 01:48:26,200
We're still here.
But in,

2119
01:48:26,201 --> 01:48:27,330
in,
in that essay,

2120
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:29,160
he said the,
um,

2121
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:30,353
the,
the,

2122
01:48:30,430 --> 01:48:34,680
the most valuable thing about science is
the realization that we don't know.

2123
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:38,730
And he said,
he said in that statement equals

2124
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:41,130
science.
Satisfactory philosophy of ignorance.

2125
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:43,950
By the way,
you said in that statement is the open

2126
01:48:43,951 --> 01:48:45,180
door,
the open channel.

2127
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:48,210
He called it.
So if we want to make progress,

2128
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:53,010
we have to understand that we don't know
everything and we have to leave things

2129
01:48:53,011 --> 01:48:56,940
to future generations and we can be
uncertain and we can change our minds.

2130
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:58,200
And he said that,
that,

2131
01:48:58,230 --> 01:49:01,470
that is a great last line.
I can't exactly what he says,

2132
01:49:01,471 --> 01:49:04,320
but he said something like,
it's our duty as scientists to

2133
01:49:04,321 --> 01:49:08,520
communicate the value of uncertainty and
the value of freedom of thought to all

2134
01:49:08,521 --> 01:49:10,320
future generations.
That's the point.

2135
01:49:10,510 --> 01:49:12,750
That's what freedom means.
Freedom,

2136
01:49:12,751 --> 01:49:15,240
it means the freedom to change your
mind.

2137
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:17,670
In fact said,
that's what democracy is.

2138
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:20,640
If you think about it,
democracy is a trial and error system,

2139
01:49:20,970 --> 01:49:21,360
so it's the.

2140
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:24,330
It's the admission that we don't know
how to do.

2141
01:49:24,331 --> 01:49:27,750
It therefore will change.
Every four years will change.

2142
01:49:27,751 --> 01:49:29,910
The president over the eight years will
change the president.

2143
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:32,490
Why?
Because the president doesn't know how

2144
01:49:32,491 --> 01:49:34,680
to do it.
Someone better.

2145
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:37,970
There will be someone better that comes
along and then someone worse and someone

2146
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:40,860
better,
but it's a trial and error system and

2147
01:49:40,861 --> 01:49:43,290
he's right and it is right that that is
the open door.

2148
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:46,680
That's that.
That's the road to progress is certainly

2149
01:49:46,681 --> 01:49:48,160
better than humility.
Yeah.

2150
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:51,360
One of the things that I love so much
about Bertrand Russell and about five

2151
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:54,960
was how human they were.
They were very human means fireman,

2152
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:59,650
like to play the Bongos and chasing
girls and Bertrand Russell was addicted

2153
01:49:59,651 --> 01:50:03,040
to tobacco.
He would talk about how he wouldn't fly

2154
01:50:03,041 --> 01:50:06,880
unless he could smoke.
Like he had to get us back when they had

2155
01:50:06,881 --> 01:50:11,320
smoking sections on airplanes and he had
his pipe and he just refused to fly

2156
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:15,250
without tobacco and couldn't imagine
being without tobacco and like that's so

2157
01:50:15,251 --> 01:50:19,450
strange because just a brilliant guy to
be addicted to such a gross thing.

2158
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:21,520
Yeah,
you're right.

2159
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:25,630
Because I think these.
These are people that found existence.

2160
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:26,500
Joyous,
right?

2161
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:27,363
Yeah.
We'll need to know.

2162
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:29,270
They just wanted to know stuff.
Yeah.

2163
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:31,810
I didn't want to know everything because
you can't know everything.

2164
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,990
Right.
And I suppose that's what you think

2165
01:50:34,991 --> 01:50:37,330
about what the job of a scientist is.
It's to.

2166
01:50:37,331 --> 01:50:42,070
It's to stand on the edge of the known
because you're a research scientist,

2167
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:44,710
so if there's nothing to note,
then you've got no job.

2168
01:50:44,990 --> 01:50:47,320
Right?
So you have to be naturally comfortable

2169
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:49,310
with not knowing.
And I,

2170
01:50:49,370 --> 01:50:52,170
if there's one thing I really do think
we.

2171
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:55,450
How do we begin to patch our countries
back up again?

2172
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:59,590
One of the reasons I think in education
is to teach people the value of

2173
01:50:59,591 --> 01:51:04,060
uncertainty,
of not knowing it is not weak to not

2174
01:51:04,061 --> 01:51:08,200
know.
It's actually natural not to know.

2175
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:11,980
And that's one of them is with religion,
is to say that you know,

2176
01:51:11,981 --> 01:51:15,730
when you do not hard to say that you
have absolute truth and absolute

2177
01:51:15,731 --> 01:51:16,720
knowledge of something.

2178
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:18,670
Yeah.
When it can't really exist.

2179
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:19,151
Yeah.
I mean,

2180
01:51:19,151 --> 01:51:20,260
history tells us,
doesn't it,

2181
01:51:20,261 --> 01:51:24,310
that anyone who thinks they've got
absolute knowledge is a causes trouble.

2182
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:27,490
Yeah.
Did you see x marketer?

2183
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:29,020
Yeah.
Did you enjoy it?

2184
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:29,891
Yes.
Yes.

2185
01:51:29,891 --> 01:51:31,480
I know.
I'm Alex Garland.

2186
01:51:31,970 --> 01:51:35,470
Sunshine over.
That was right in 28 days later.

2187
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:38,290
And the new movie,
the Weird One,

2188
01:51:38,291 --> 01:51:39,760
the alien movie,
he wrote that as well.

2189
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:40,860
Right?
Um,

2190
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,960
dilation and.
Great.

2191
01:51:43,961 --> 01:51:44,950
Sandra.
Yeah.

2192
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:46,120
Yeah.
Um,

2193
01:51:46,510 --> 01:51:48,970
do you,
are you scared of artificial life?

2194
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,050
Artificial intelligence.
And Elan Musk scare the shit out of me.

2195
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:55,030
Yeah.
When he talked about it.

2196
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:58,210
Like he,
he talks about it like we're in the

2197
01:51:58,211 --> 01:52:03,040
opening scene of a science fiction movie
where he's trying to warn people and

2198
01:52:03,041 --> 01:52:06,550
then they don't listen to the genius.
And it goes south,

2199
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:12,010
sort of depends.
I chaired a debate on this society in

2200
01:52:12,011 --> 01:52:14,680
London a few weeks ago and uh,
they.

2201
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:18,620
So it's true now at the moment what
people tend to be frightened of a

2202
01:52:18,621 --> 01:52:22,030
general ai's or Agi,
they called artificial general

2203
01:52:22,031 --> 01:52:24,190
intelligence,
which is like what we talked about

2204
01:52:24,191 --> 01:52:26,980
earlier,
a human like capability thing.

2205
01:52:26,981 --> 01:52:28,150
Yes.
Um,

2206
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:31,120
and we're miles away from that.
We don't know how to do it.

2207
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:35,650
We haven't got them and we miles away.
So at the moment artificial intelligence

2208
01:52:35,651 --> 01:52:39,700
is expert systems and very focused
systems that do particular things.

2209
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:44,800
You can be scared of them in a limited
economic sense because they're going to

2210
01:52:44,810 --> 01:52:47,300
displace people's jobs.
And actually,

2211
01:52:47,301 --> 01:52:49,040
interestingly in this panel discussion
we had,

2212
01:52:49,041 --> 01:52:52,400
it's going to be like what you might
call middle class jobs in the UK,

2213
01:52:52,401 --> 01:52:57,320
so white collar jobs because people are
interested in universal basic income to

2214
01:52:57,321 --> 01:53:01,040
sort of replace money that it's going to
be lost because there will be no jobs

2215
01:53:01,041 --> 01:53:01,520
for all these people.

2216
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,800
Otherwise we have just a mask attached.
Yeah,

2217
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:06,950
they're very good.
Someone said that these systems,

2218
01:53:06,951 --> 01:53:09,530
artificial intelligence systems at the
moment are very good at doing things

2219
01:53:09,531 --> 01:53:12,320
like law lawyers work.
So they're very good at reading

2220
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:14,600
contracts and things like that.
There's interesting.

2221
01:53:14,650 --> 01:53:17,210
It's a revolution,
it's not like the industrial revolution.

2222
01:53:17,211 --> 01:53:20,570
Where is manual labor that gets hit
necessarily?

2223
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:24,410
This is kind of interesting because it
hits that kind of intermediate level

2224
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:27,710
that usually escapes.
And so you're right,

2225
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:32,330
one of the answers is to tax.
There was an example was a robot tax.

2226
01:53:32,331 --> 01:53:34,730
So in a car factory you say to the
manufacturer,

2227
01:53:34,731 --> 01:53:35,480
well,
okay,

2228
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:37,820
you can have a robot,
what you pay the robot the same as you

2229
01:53:37,821 --> 01:53:41,870
pay a person and then that money goes
into funding universal basic income or

2230
01:53:41,871 --> 01:53:44,540
something like that.
So I think there's got to be an economic

2231
01:53:44,541 --> 01:53:46,700
change because these systems will be
there,

2232
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:52,390
but all the experts I spoke to agreed
that the idea of a terminator style,

2233
01:53:53,570 --> 01:53:57,380
General Intelligence taking over the
world is miles away.

2234
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:01,400
And um,
so whilst we might start thinking about

2235
01:54:01,401 --> 01:54:05,150
the regulation,
it's not going to happen soon,

2236
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:08,150
is the general point.
I think.

2237
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:11,800
So I would disagree with him on that.
I think.

2238
01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:14,390
I think it's too far in the future at
the moment.

2239
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:16,820
I think it might be one of those people
that's an ad.

2240
01:54:16,821 --> 01:54:18,280
It's going to be all right.
And then then,

2241
01:54:18,281 --> 01:54:21,260
you know,
my iphone takes me out on the way to

2242
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:22,133
the.
Yeah,

2243
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:25,130
that's the thing.
It's not like choice at the moment,

2244
01:54:25,131 --> 01:54:25,641
isn't it?
I mean,

2245
01:54:25,641 --> 01:54:27,710
don't,
don't give your phone a laser,

2246
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:31,220
for example.
And it doesn't matter if it goes crazy

2247
01:54:31,221 --> 01:54:32,860
and tries to take over the world.
I know,

2248
01:54:32,861 --> 01:54:34,950
I know that's a bit facetious because
they can see.

2249
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:37,880
He would say they could take other power
grids and all that kind of stuff.

2250
01:54:39,070 --> 01:54:41,210
Well,
it's these concepts that are really hard

2251
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:45,410
to visualize,
like Sora Kurzweil's idea of the

2252
01:54:45,411 --> 01:54:49,910
exponential increase of technology
leading us to a point in the near

2253
01:54:49,911 --> 01:54:50,570
future.

2254
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:52,490
Where are you going to be able to
download your consciousness into a

2255
01:54:52,491 --> 01:54:54,530
computer?
You talked to computer experts.

2256
01:54:54,531 --> 01:54:55,311
It like this.
No Way.

2257
01:54:55,311 --> 01:54:57,590
We're miles away from that.
Neuroscientists,

2258
01:54:58,070 --> 01:55:02,600
scientists.
So you knew one brain cell,

2259
01:55:02,601 --> 01:55:05,900
probably we can't,
but Kurzweil's convinced that what's

2260
01:55:05,901 --> 01:55:10,460
going to happen is that as technology
increases and increases in this wildly

2261
01:55:10,461 --> 01:55:13,760
exponential way where we really can't
visualize it,

2262
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:18,560
we can't even imagine how much
advancement will take place over 50

2263
01:55:18,561 --> 01:55:20,510
years.
But in those 50 years,

2264
01:55:20,511 --> 01:55:24,200
something's going to happen that
radically changes our idea of what's

2265
01:55:24,201 --> 01:55:27,920
possible and I think Elon shares this
idea as well that it's going to sneak up

2266
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:30,410
on us so quickly that when it does go
live,

2267
01:55:30,411 --> 01:55:31,760
it'll be too late.
Yeah,

2268
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:34,910
I mean it's worth putting the framework
in place.

2269
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:37,910
I think the regulatory framework,
even as you said,

2270
01:55:37,911 --> 01:55:40,550
for the more realistic problem,
which is people's jobs are going to get

2271
01:55:40,551 --> 01:55:43,700
displaced and that there's a great,
um,

2272
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:46,320
was at a thing in some segments that I
come in and it was,

2273
01:55:46,321 --> 01:55:49,020
but they said that the,
it was a politician that the job of the

2274
01:55:49,021 --> 01:55:53,100
innovation system is to create jobs
faster than it destroys them.

2275
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:57,120
So you've always got to remember that as
a government and as regulators,

2276
01:55:57,300 --> 01:56:01,170
if you're going to allow technologies
into the marketplace that destroy

2277
01:56:01,171 --> 01:56:04,650
people's jobs,
it is your responsibility to find a way

2278
01:56:04,651 --> 01:56:07,830
of replacing those jobs or compensate in
those people,

2279
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,370
as you said,
for the breakdown,

2280
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:11,910
social,
human being,

2281
01:56:11,911 --> 01:56:16,860
those that people need some meaning,
like they just giving them income I

2282
01:56:16,861 --> 01:56:19,610
think is just gonna
mean.

2283
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:23,100
It's just my speculation.
But it's going to create massive spare

2284
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:26,460
even if provide them,
you provide them with food and shelter,

2285
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:31,380
they need people need things to do,
so there's going to be some sort of a

2286
01:56:31,381 --> 01:56:36,150
demand to find meaning for people,
give them occupations,

2287
01:56:36,151 --> 01:56:38,370
give them something,
some task,

2288
01:56:38,670 --> 01:56:42,360
let's say.
It seems to be one of the critical parts

2289
01:56:42,361 --> 01:56:45,840
of being a person.
So we need things to do that we find

2290
01:56:45,841 --> 01:56:47,160
meaning in,
you know,

2291
01:56:47,161 --> 01:56:50,730
like you were talking about were the
only things that we know of that have

2292
01:56:50,731 --> 01:56:53,970
meaning,
that find meaning and sharing meaning

2293
01:56:53,971 --> 01:56:57,570
and believe in that we're gonna need
something like that.

2294
01:56:57,570 --> 01:57:01,170
If universal basic income comes along,
I don't think it's going to be enough to

2295
01:57:01,171 --> 01:57:04,710
just feed people and house them.
They're gonna want something to do.

2296
01:57:04,711 --> 01:57:05,780
If a,
you know,

2297
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:07,140
a person is a,
you're,

2298
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:10,890
you're doing something for an occupation
and this is your identity.

2299
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:13,800
And then all of a sudden that occupation
becomes irrelevant because computer does

2300
01:57:13,801 --> 01:57:15,180
it faster,
cheaper,

2301
01:57:15,181 --> 01:57:18,210
quicker.
These people are going to have this

2302
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:22,290
incredible feeling of despair and just
not being valuable.

2303
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:23,480
Yeah,
I mean,

2304
01:57:23,481 --> 01:57:23,970
uh,
what?

2305
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:25,260
Well,
the utopian.

2306
01:57:25,550 --> 01:57:28,620
So the version of this is to everybody
gets to do what we're doing,

2307
01:57:28,621 --> 01:57:33,020
now she's make a living.
So thinking and creating that kind of,

2308
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:35,880
you know,
so that that's the Utopian ideal is you

2309
01:57:35,881 --> 01:57:39,720
don't need to do the stuff.
The job that you don't really want to do

2310
01:57:39,721 --> 01:57:41,400
in the factory,
right?

2311
01:57:41,570 --> 01:57:44,540
You can do the thing that humans are
best at that,

2312
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:45,653
but I agree.

2313
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:50,820
That's a very utopian view.
Does everybody want to do that?

2314
01:57:50,910 --> 01:57:54,270
Or does everybody have their mindset
will maybe goes to education if

2315
01:57:54,271 --> 01:57:58,680
everybody had an interest like that,
if everybody went on to make pottery and

2316
01:57:58,681 --> 01:58:01,950
painting and doing all these different
things they've always really wanted to

2317
01:58:01,951 --> 01:58:06,951
do and their needs are met by the
universal basic income money that they

2318
01:58:07,081 --> 01:58:09,630
receive every month.
But boy,

2319
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:13,650
there's a lot of people I don't think
have those desires or needs and to sort

2320
01:58:13,651 --> 01:58:17,310
of force them onto them at age 55 or
whatever it's going to be.

2321
01:58:17,610 --> 01:58:19,560
It seems to be very,
very difficult.

2322
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:20,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

2323
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:24,540
I agree.
It's a big challenge,

2324
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:30,080
but I think that in concept at least
it's inevitable that we do have some

2325
01:58:30,361 --> 01:58:35,361
sort of an artificial intelligence that
resembles us or that resembles something

2326
01:58:35,461 --> 01:58:39,570
like x mark and if people choose to
create that,

2327
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:42,370
we could choose create it in our own
image.

2328
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:44,020
But that's very godlike,
isn't it?

2329
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:46,780
God created us in his own image.
Yeah.

2330
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:47,681
And,
and again,

2331
01:58:47,681 --> 01:58:52,540
yeah.
I don't know that when I talk to people

2332
01:58:52,541 --> 01:58:57,070
in the field as you probably are,
most of them say don't have to do it.

2333
01:58:57,600 --> 01:58:58,620
Yes.
It's really,

2334
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:03,010
it's going to be miles away,
so maybe I'm hiding my head in the sand

2335
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:04,990
a bit,
but I don't think so.

2336
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:09,010
I think it's.
I think we'll know it when I don't think

2337
01:59:09,011 --> 01:59:13,060
anyone's going to do it accidentally,
so I don't think it's just suddenly

2338
01:59:13,061 --> 01:59:14,210
going to be upon us.
I,

2339
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:17,460
I,
I think we will see it will,

2340
01:59:17,470 --> 01:59:20,980
we will see ourselves getting,
acquiring that capability.

2341
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:24,310
We'll see ourselves getting close.
We'll see their systems beginning to

2342
01:59:24,910 --> 01:59:28,900
emerge and then we will think about it.
I think 200 years ago,

2343
01:59:28,901 --> 01:59:31,990
if you wanted a photograph or something,
you want a picture of something you had

2344
01:59:31,991 --> 01:59:32,824
to draw.
I

2345
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:34,650
mean,

2346
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:37,540
there was no photography 200 years ago.
Yeah,

2347
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:41,670
I mean just think of that is almost
inconceivable.

2348
01:59:42,630 --> 01:59:44,700
No automobiles,
no photography.

2349
01:59:44,910 --> 01:59:47,820
What was automobile?
Maybe there was some sort of machines

2350
01:59:47,821 --> 01:59:48,990
that drove people around.
Right?

2351
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:52,440
Something close.
There was earlier than that,

2352
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:54,900
right?
You go back 500 years,

2353
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,210
you have almost nothing.
Yeah,

2354
01:59:56,490 --> 01:59:58,110
it's crazy.
How are we being quick?

2355
01:59:58,470 --> 02:00:01,110
So fast.
It's so fast.

2356
02:00:01,111 --> 02:00:02,220
I mean,
and then this,

2357
02:00:02,221 --> 02:00:05,100
what we're doing right now,
there's people right now in their car

2358
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:08,070
that are streaming this,
so they're in their car and they're

2359
02:00:08,071 --> 02:00:09,420
listening as they're driving on the
road.

2360
02:00:09,421 --> 02:00:12,180
Maybe they have a tesla,
maybe they have an electric car.

2361
02:00:12,570 --> 02:00:16,800
They're driving down the road streaming
to people talking where it's ones and

2362
02:00:16,801 --> 02:00:21,360
Zeros that are broken down and there's
some audible form and you can listen to

2363
02:00:21,361 --> 02:00:23,370
it in your car.
That is

2364
02:00:24,230 --> 02:00:25,340
bananas.
Yeah,

2365
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:28,280
I agree.
We've been quick so quick.

2366
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:28,911
Well,
I think that they will,

2367
02:00:28,911 --> 02:00:29,870
you know,
the Internet.

2368
02:00:29,990 --> 02:00:30,823
I mean,
it's uh,

2369
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:32,870
it's uh,
not long.

2370
02:00:32,871 --> 02:00:37,640
I mean I remember it being invented.
Well certainly the web,

2371
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:41,630
so the web,
while it was very early for me because I

2372
02:00:41,631 --> 02:00:44,690
was in the,
in particle physics and of course the

2373
02:00:44,691 --> 02:00:47,510
web comes from certain,
the www bit,

2374
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:49,910
right.
So it certainly in the early nineties I

2375
02:00:49,911 --> 02:00:52,970
was involved in that,
um,

2376
02:00:53,050 --> 02:00:53,480
you know,
in,

2377
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:56,390
in the university environment with email
and all that kind of stuff.

2378
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:59,180
So I don't,
I don't know when it kind of didn't

2379
02:00:59,181 --> 02:01:00,780
really.
You could have,

2380
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:04,370
you could have a web browser that just
the only sites that were there and Nasa

2381
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:06,860
and uh,
I think NASA edited one of the early

2382
02:01:06,861 --> 02:01:09,080
sites and cern.
It was very loud.

2383
02:01:09,170 --> 02:01:10,490
When did you become involved with siren?

2384
02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:16,280
So that would be.
I started doing particle physics in 95.

2385
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:19,640
And when was,
when did the large Hadron collider go

2386
02:01:19,641 --> 02:01:20,840
live?
That was,

2387
02:01:20,841 --> 02:01:23,890
um,
I remember it was 2000 and

2388
02:01:25,490 --> 02:01:29,030
2007.
I think he was 2008 is so long ago.

2389
02:01:29,031 --> 02:01:32,050
That was about 10 years ago.
But he started out,

2390
02:01:32,051 --> 02:01:35,480
we started off and then we had a problem
with it and then it took a while to fix.

2391
02:01:35,740 --> 02:01:38,270
Um,
so hasn't been taking data that long,

2392
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:42,340
but it's a tremendously successful thing
now and it's,

2393
02:01:42,390 --> 02:01:45,290
it's operating beyond this design
capabilities.

2394
02:01:45,291 --> 02:01:48,610
It's quite incredible.
And so stunning is an incredible thing

2395
02:01:49,190 --> 02:01:50,090
that this,
I mean,

2396
02:01:50,091 --> 02:01:52,730
how large is it?
How long has the largest is 27

2397
02:01:52,731 --> 02:01:54,830
kilometers.
So I'd say about 16 miles.

2398
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:56,840
Sixteen miles.
And it's a circular.

2399
02:01:57,110 --> 02:01:58,400
Yeah,
sort of a building.

2400
02:01:58,550 --> 02:01:59,250
Yeah.
Well,

2401
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:03,200
I say it's a big tube and mean you think
basically it's mainly under France and

2402
02:02:03,201 --> 02:02:07,220
partly into Switzerland and he
accelerates protons around in a circle

2403
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:08,910
both ways that won't.

2404
02:02:08,970 --> 02:02:11,720
One beam goes well.
My one goes either way and they go round

2405
02:02:11,721 --> 02:02:15,120
11,000 times a second because that's the
very close.

2406
02:02:15,130 --> 02:02:16,670
The speed of light.
90 nine point nine,

2407
02:02:16,671 --> 02:02:17,120
nine,
nine,

2408
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:17,601
nine,
nine,

2409
02:02:17,601 --> 02:02:18,740
nine percent.
The speed of light.

2410
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:22,100
And then we crossed the beams and
collide the particles.

2411
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:25,280
And in those collisions you're
recreating the conditions that were

2412
02:02:25,281 --> 02:02:28,310
present or less than a billionth of a
second after the big bang.

2413
02:02:28,910 --> 02:02:31,760
So we know that physics,
so going back,

2414
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:36,920
reset about the carbon and the oxygen,
we can trace that story back way beyond

2415
02:02:36,921 --> 02:02:40,490
the time when they were protons and
neutrons to when they were quarks and

2416
02:02:40,491 --> 02:02:45,491
gluons around and go all the way back
and the Higgs on doing its thing back

2417
02:02:45,591 --> 02:02:50,120
then and so we can see all that physics
in the lab.

2418
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:54,170
So that's why we have some,
a lot of confidence in that story.

2419
02:02:54,410 --> 02:02:58,620
It's so fascinating that they were able
to talk someone into funding that,

2420
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:02,740
that they got a bunch of people together
and that you,

2421
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:07,120
you were able to explain to politicians
and,

2422
02:03:07,170 --> 02:03:09,800
and you know,
regular people,

2423
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:11,420
what,
what you're trying to do.

2424
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:15,200
He a great example of how you get
something done.

2425
02:03:15,230 --> 02:03:18,440
So it was the night in the fifties when
certain was established,

2426
02:03:18,441 --> 02:03:21,540
I think it was 53 or 54,
can't quite remember it.

2427
02:03:21,541 --> 02:03:23,300
Something like that.
And um,

2428
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:28,720
it was bill from the Second World War,
so at the end of the war and it was

2429
02:03:28,791 --> 02:03:33,410
realized that the only way forward for
Europe was collaboration to rebuild the

2430
02:03:33,411 --> 02:03:38,030
scientific base and in,
for peace for peaceful purposes.

2431
02:03:38,270 --> 02:03:41,580
And so certain was set up as an
international collaboration in Europe

2432
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:45,020
initially with that political ideal that
it would,

2433
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:47,840
it would explore nature,
uh,

2434
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:49,670
just for,
for the,

2435
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:53,690
for freely and for peace,
for peaceful means,

2436
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:55,093
peaceful reasons.

2437
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:56,550
And so that was,
uh,

2438
02:03:57,150 --> 02:03:58,700
the,
the politics was right.

2439
02:03:58,701 --> 02:04:03,701
So we set it by international treaty so
that the member states are bound

2440
02:04:03,831 --> 02:04:06,830
together by a treaty and they pay a
small amount,

2441
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:09,380
relatively small amount each into
certain every year,

2442
02:04:09,830 --> 02:04:13,790
which is a percentage of their GDP.
And that's the money they used to build

2443
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:15,530
the experiments and build the
accelerators.

2444
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:20,420
So it's very hard to get out of it.
And you wouldn't really want to because

2445
02:04:20,421 --> 02:04:24,680
it's a small amount of money per country
and stern doesn't get extra money to

2446
02:04:24,681 --> 02:04:27,440
build things.
It just takes his money and basically

2447
02:04:27,441 --> 02:04:30,740
saved up and plans itself.
But because it's got a regular stream of

2448
02:04:30,741 --> 02:04:32,650
money,
it can do it so you can say we're going

2449
02:04:32,651 --> 02:04:35,750
to build this machine and it will take
eight years because that's how much

2450
02:04:35,751 --> 02:04:38,760
money we've got now,
mobility in eight years and we know how

2451
02:04:38,761 --> 02:04:40,530
much money we've got so we can do it
you.

2452
02:04:40,690 --> 02:04:43,260
It's less than.
I mean the reason that the US collider,

2453
02:04:43,330 --> 02:04:48,330
the SSC failed is because it's the
problem you have in the us with the

2454
02:04:48,721 --> 02:04:51,630
funding system as you've seen in the
last few weeks,

2455
02:04:51,990 --> 02:04:56,760
is that it's very arbitrary and it's
open to political maneuvering and things

2456
02:04:56,761 --> 02:04:59,700
can be shut down and take an uncertain
is not like that.

2457
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:04,820
Cerner has got a guaranteed stream of
funding small from each country and so

2458
02:05:05,521 --> 02:05:08,520
you can do these projects.
And the one in the US that was during

2459
02:05:08,521 --> 02:05:09,870
the Clinton administration is.
I would.

2460
02:05:09,871 --> 02:05:11,280
It was a.
yeah,

2461
02:05:11,281 --> 02:05:13,050
it was.
It was it Clinton.

2462
02:05:13,170 --> 02:05:18,170
It was closed down by Congress and a
very slim vote and it was in Texas,

2463
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:21,900
so it was.
It was one of those things where you've

2464
02:05:21,901 --> 02:05:26,430
got states vying for money and he was
half built and everyone was there,

2465
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:27,390
you know,
the thing,

2466
02:05:27,391 --> 02:05:30,300
it was bigger than the LHC and it was
Thursday.

2467
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:34,140
So you waste a lot of money.
Is that a huge disappointment for

2468
02:05:34,141 --> 02:05:36,480
scientific community?
Like where people very hopeful that this

2469
02:05:36,481 --> 02:05:38,610
was going to go live.
It was being built.

2470
02:05:38,670 --> 02:05:40,260
So it doug,
half the tunnel.

2471
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:43,120
What would it be able to do that?
The LHC could.

2472
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:45,630
It was a higher energy accelerated in
the LHC.

2473
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:47,970
So it would have discovered the higgs
particle first.

2474
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:50,160
Uh,
had it been running,

2475
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:52,590
but the,
the half bill part,

2476
02:05:52,591 --> 02:05:56,010
is it useless now or can they charge it
up again now?

2477
02:05:56,011 --> 02:05:58,020
I think they filled in.
I think so.

2478
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:00,530
I mean it was just half a tunnel,
you know,

2479
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:05,580
that's the thing.
You can do these wonderful things for

2480
02:06:05,581 --> 02:06:10,500
not a lot of money if you just do it
over many years now.

2481
02:06:10,501 --> 02:06:11,810
Stable funding.
Yeah.

2482
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:13,230
Commit to doing it.
The filling in,

2483
02:06:13,231 --> 02:06:15,480
in part slurry.
And you look at cern as well,

2484
02:06:15,481 --> 02:06:16,080
and people.

2485
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:17,100
Yeah.
People ask me now,

2486
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:21,270
I think the UK pays about $100,000,000 a
year.

2487
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:24,840
That's what the UK pays in and it's
about St Germany,

2488
02:06:24,841 --> 02:06:27,060
same two friends and so on.
And so people say,

2489
02:06:27,061 --> 02:06:28,070
what do we get for that?
I mean,

2490
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:30,870
first of all,
it's not the whole budget seven is about

2491
02:06:30,871 --> 02:06:33,900
the same as a budget of a medium sized
university.

2492
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:37,140
So it's not a lot.
It's about a billion dollars a year or

2493
02:06:37,141 --> 02:06:40,200
something,
which is what a university has.

2494
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:42,750
So there's not a lot in the scheme of
things.

2495
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:44,970
Um,
what has it done though?

2496
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:46,770
Well,
we invented the World Wide Web,

2497
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:49,860
as we've just said,
a lot of the medical imaging technology

2498
02:06:49,861 --> 02:06:53,640
that we use comes from cern,
is pioneered the use of these very high

2499
02:06:53,641 --> 02:06:57,900
field magnet switch is what it needed.
So it's engineering at the edge and

2500
02:06:57,901 --> 02:07:02,160
engineering at the edge generates
spinoffs and expertise to get used in

2501
02:07:02,161 --> 02:07:02,910
other fields.

2502
02:07:02,910 --> 02:07:05,760
So it's cancer treatment,
so called Hadron beam therapy.

2503
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:09,900
So if you got a brain tumor now,
it's quite likely that you'll have one

2504
02:07:09,901 --> 02:07:12,150
of these targeted particle beam
therapies,

2505
02:07:12,570 --> 02:07:15,720
which is like very highly targeted sort
of chemotherapy.

2506
02:07:15,721 --> 02:07:20,370
It's not chemotherapy radiation you can
target in a beam into your head and

2507
02:07:20,371 --> 02:07:24,480
attack the tumor and those,
those are particle accelerators.

2508
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:29,160
So most pathway accelerators today here
in hospitals and in medicine,

2509
02:07:29,610 --> 02:07:33,440
but they came from doing particle
physics that.

2510
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:34,650
So the,
the,

2511
02:07:34,670 --> 02:07:39,670
the of these big experiments at the edge
of our capability are always immense,

2512
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:44,230
which is why they're worth funding at
these very low levels.

2513
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:48,460
But it's not just the knowledge,
it's the engineering expertise that

2514
02:07:48,461 --> 02:07:51,060
there is a practical application for
every everyday.

2515
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:53,710
They're always,
it's just finding out how to do hard

2516
02:07:53,740 --> 02:07:56,950
things is usually useful.
The moral,

2517
02:07:57,340 --> 02:08:00,370
and it wasn't just the Higgs Boson
particle that you guys had discovered.

2518
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:03,620
What is cork glue on plasma?
Yeah.

2519
02:08:03,621 --> 02:08:04,540
So that,
that's um,

2520
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:08,320
shortly after the billionth of a second,
after the big bang.

2521
02:08:08,321 --> 02:08:13,321
So you end up with a soup of quarks and
gluons quarks are the building blocks of

2522
02:08:13,721 --> 02:08:17,320
protons and neutrons and glue onto the
things that stick them together.

2523
02:08:17,860 --> 02:08:22,300
And so a proton as to up quarks and down
quark and in each and stu down quarks

2524
02:08:22,301 --> 02:08:24,340
and up quark and so on,
so that the constituents,

2525
02:08:24,370 --> 02:08:26,980
the protons and neutrons,
which are their constituents of our

2526
02:08:26,981 --> 02:08:31,150
atomic nuclei and savy go if you get to
very high temperatures,

2527
02:08:31,151 --> 02:08:33,880
are high energies,
then the protons and neutrons falter

2528
02:08:33,940 --> 02:08:37,570
bits.
Then you end up with a soup of quarks

2529
02:08:37,571 --> 02:08:42,160
and gluons that's acquired gluon plasma.
And it's insanely dense,

2530
02:08:42,161 --> 02:08:43,240
right?
Yeah.

2531
02:08:43,241 --> 02:08:44,320
Well,
very high energy.

2532
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:45,850
So,
um,

2533
02:08:45,850 --> 02:08:48,470
so you get that.
So we've been exploring that bite.

2534
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:48,960
Could we.

2535
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:53,960
We don't only collide protons together,
we can collide a lead nuclei together or

2536
02:08:54,011 --> 02:08:58,780
silver nuclei together at the LHC and
that's when you make these kind of suit,

2537
02:08:58,870 --> 02:09:01,270
civil nuclear matter,
if you like,

2538
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:05,470
very hot nuclear matter to explore that
physics to that and that nuclear

2539
02:09:05,471 --> 02:09:09,550
physics.
And I was reading something about the

2540
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:14,660
weight of that stuff that like a sugar
cube.

2541
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:16,261
Like what,
what is the,

2542
02:09:16,261 --> 02:09:19,710
what is the actual weight,
where defends our density is.

2543
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:21,600
So don't they?
I mean,

2544
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:24,320
the,
the thing I remember is the sugar cube

2545
02:09:24,321 --> 02:09:27,010
of a neutron star material,
which is,

2546
02:09:27,070 --> 02:09:30,600
I don't know how many hundred million
tons I can,

2547
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:31,960
you know,
it depends,

2548
02:09:31,961 --> 02:09:33,680
but.
So I don't know where the quite glum

2549
02:09:33,710 --> 02:09:34,940
plasma.
I don't know what number you're.

2550
02:09:35,410 --> 02:09:39,220
There was something that was one of the
things after the discovery they were

2551
02:09:39,221 --> 02:09:44,221
talking about the massive weight of
court gluon plasma in like almost

2552
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:45,970
incomprehensible.

2553
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:46,811
Yeah.
Yeah.

2554
02:09:46,811 --> 02:09:48,940
I don't know the number but,
but something crazy.

2555
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:49,793
Yeah.
Yeah.

2556
02:09:50,290 --> 02:09:52,720
Now one,
once these,

2557
02:09:53,130 --> 02:09:54,490
you got something.
Oh,

2558
02:09:54,491 --> 02:09:56,160
here it is.
Forty billion million.

2559
02:09:56,920 --> 02:09:59,980
Oh my God.
A cubic centimeter would weigh 40

2560
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:00,970
billion tons.
Oh,

2561
02:10:02,170 --> 02:10:04,990
good Lord.
I didn't know that.

2562
02:10:05,290 --> 02:10:08,950
I don't know David actually.
Yeah.

2563
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:11,380
The dentist matter.
Creating the big bang machine.

2564
02:10:12,870 --> 02:10:16,480
What are they doing right now?
It's clothes for engineering and

2565
02:10:16,481 --> 02:10:18,670
upgrades and upgrades.
Yeah.

2566
02:10:18,730 --> 02:10:20,770
I mean,
one thing we trying to do is one of the

2567
02:10:20,771 --> 02:10:24,790
things in particle physics is that you
want as many collisions per second as

2568
02:10:24,791 --> 02:10:29,550
you can generate and um,
they have a collision wherever.

2569
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:33,130
What's got a bunch crossing Lhc,
we can vary,

2570
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:36,860
but it's something like 25 Nano seconds
depending on what it's really.

2571
02:10:37,210 --> 02:10:41,390
We get a lot of collisions per second
and the more collisions per second you

2572
02:10:41,391 --> 02:10:44,060
can get,
the more chance you have a make an

2573
02:10:44,061 --> 02:10:48,020
interest in things like higgs particles
or whatever else may be out there

2574
02:10:48,170 --> 02:10:49,070
waiting to be discovered.

2575
02:10:49,070 --> 02:10:51,320
I mean,
it's possible there are other particles

2576
02:10:51,321 --> 02:10:54,770
out there that we haven't yet discovered
that could be within the reach of the

2577
02:10:54,771 --> 02:10:59,771
LHC and if this one that was in Texas
had gotten built and it was more

2578
02:11:00,021 --> 02:11:03,470
powerful than the Lhc,
you'd have even more opportunity to do

2579
02:11:03,471 --> 02:11:04,320
something like that.
Yeah.

2580
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:08,540
Now when these things are created by
these collisions,

2581
02:11:08,870 --> 02:11:11,150
how long do they last?
Oh,

2582
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:15,970
fractions of a second.
So that the general rule in physics and

2583
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:20,570
particle physics is that the more
massive it is and the more things it can

2584
02:11:20,571 --> 02:11:22,550
decay into,
the faster it'll do that.

2585
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:26,810
And so basically the,
the heavy things decay into light things

2586
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:29,150
and so the only.
The stable particles,

2587
02:11:29,190 --> 02:11:34,190
things like electrons
and some of the quarks and the up quarks

2588
02:11:34,821 --> 02:11:37,430
and down quarks is stable things.
But uh,

2589
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:39,950
so,
so everything tends to decay very fast.

2590
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,860
So we're talking fractioned billions of
a second fractions.

2591
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:48,160
And how are they less than that?
How are they registering it's existence.

2592
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:51,050
Like what is,
what is being used to measure it?

2593
02:11:51,410 --> 02:11:56,090
So what you see if you collide the adhc
we collide protons together,

2594
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:58,010
then president,
I've got loads of stuff in them,

2595
02:11:58,100 --> 02:12:01,130
loads of gluons quarks.
So yeah,

2596
02:12:01,140 --> 02:12:02,510
big mess.
First of all.

2597
02:12:02,870 --> 02:12:07,100
So most of it's a load of particles or
spray now we should not interested in.

2598
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:10,730
But sometimes when you,
when let's say a couple of the glue on

2599
02:12:10,731 --> 02:12:15,050
was banging together and they can make
something interesting like a top quark

2600
02:12:15,110 --> 02:12:17,640
or a higgs particle.
What's a top court?

2601
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:18,770
It's not quite,
it's a very heavy.

2602
02:12:18,771 --> 02:12:21,980
There's six quarks.
So there's up and down chairman,

2603
02:12:21,981 --> 02:12:26,981
strange bottom and top farm and strange.
So strange was literally in the,

2604
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:32,050
was it the fifties I discovered them.
Someone said that's really strange and

2605
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:34,220
strange and new kind of farcical.

2606
02:12:34,900 --> 02:12:38,000
And so yes,
we have six quarks and they're in three

2607
02:12:38,001 --> 02:12:40,430
families,
so the up and down or one family,

2608
02:12:40,850 --> 02:12:42,470
and then the chairman,
stranger,

2609
02:12:42,471 --> 02:12:44,660
another family in the top and bottom of
the third family.

2610
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:48,290
And so we for some reason,
so the only thing the only fast because

2611
02:12:48,291 --> 02:12:51,710
we need to make up you and me are up
quarks down quarks and electrons,

2612
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:56,450
but for some reason there are two
further copies of those which are

2613
02:12:56,451 --> 02:12:58,490
identical in every way except they're
heavier.

2614
02:12:59,150 --> 02:13:02,580
So there's the charm and the strange
quark and if they're in a heavy electron

2615
02:13:02,581 --> 02:13:05,090
called immune,
and then there's a the top and the

2616
02:13:05,091 --> 02:13:08,000
bottom quark and another heavy electron
call the tail.

2617
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:12,020
And that's it.
So that there's this weird pattern that

2618
02:13:12,021 --> 02:13:13,610
we don't understand.
So we don't.

2619
02:13:13,730 --> 02:13:18,290
Seems like you only needed the first
family to build a universe.

2620
02:13:18,620 --> 02:13:21,620
Right?
But for some reason there are two copies

2621
02:13:21,890 --> 02:13:25,250
now when the heavy ones decay into the
lighter ones is the point.

2622
02:13:25,250 --> 02:13:27,260
So when you make them,
they're not around very long.

2623
02:13:27,980 --> 02:13:31,070
And just answer your question,
what happens is that when they decay,

2624
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:34,020
throw their decay products out into our
detector.

2625
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:39,240
So we take a photograph of the cascade
of particles that comes from these

2626
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:43,060
heavier particles decaying,
and the trick is to patch it all,

2627
02:13:43,061 --> 02:13:45,900
look to see,
to try and work out where everything

2628
02:13:45,901 --> 02:13:47,730
came from.
Wow.

2629
02:13:48,420 --> 02:13:52,020
Now when they finally find these
unexpected particles,

2630
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:54,840
then what happens?
Then there's the study of them.

2631
02:13:54,841 --> 02:13:57,630
Then there's the and everybody gets
together and go,

2632
02:13:57,631 --> 02:13:58,800
okay,
what the hell is that?

2633
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:00,121
Yeah,
what does that,

2634
02:14:00,121 --> 02:14:02,100
what do we do?
So we want to know where the Higgs

2635
02:14:02,101 --> 02:14:04,790
particle.
We know what it does is it gives them

2636
02:14:04,791 --> 02:14:08,670
access to everything.
So it's fundamentally the thing that

2637
02:14:08,671 --> 02:14:12,180
gives mass to all the other things in
the universe at the most fundamental

2638
02:14:12,181 --> 02:14:13,010
level.

2639
02:14:13,010 --> 02:14:15,570
So,
so electrons for example,

2640
02:14:16,290 --> 02:14:18,160
and the up and down quarks.
And again,

2641
02:14:18,161 --> 02:14:20,820
a mess from their interaction with the
Higgs.

2642
02:14:21,180 --> 02:14:23,940
That's why they're massive.
That's another reason we exist.

2643
02:14:23,941 --> 02:14:25,380
You know,
we go way back.

2644
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:27,900
We wouldn't exist if there wasn't mass
in the universe.

2645
02:14:28,350 --> 02:14:31,800
And the Higgs is ultimately responsible
for that mess.

2646
02:14:32,370 --> 02:14:35,790
And I keep saying,
I keep caveat in it because then you get

2647
02:14:35,791 --> 02:14:38,070
other sorts of masks that are generated,
but,

2648
02:14:38,330 --> 02:14:43,330
but that the fundamental basic seed is
it where is from is from the Higgs and

2649
02:14:44,460 --> 02:14:48,150
so what we want to know is we want to
know how that thing behaves and the way

2650
02:14:48,310 --> 02:14:51,060
you want to study it.
So you want to make a lot of them so you

2651
02:14:51,061 --> 02:14:55,170
can take a lot of pictures of it and
study it a lot and see exactly how it

2652
02:14:55,171 --> 02:14:56,850
does that.
And so that's what we're doing.

2653
02:14:57,210 --> 02:14:58,650
That's what we're engaged in at the
moment.

2654
02:14:58,651 --> 02:15:03,450
We're making high precision measurements
of the way that particle behaves so we

2655
02:15:03,451 --> 02:15:07,770
can understand the laws of nature.
I mean that that is the laws of nature.

2656
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:10,170
How are those particles behave and what
are they doing.

2657
02:15:11,130 --> 02:15:16,130
But it is possible that some new form of
some new form of particles,

2658
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:19,750
something else could be discovered.
Yeah.

2659
02:15:19,850 --> 02:15:24,160
The we know about yet because we know
almost know that there,

2660
02:15:24,170 --> 02:15:26,190
there are other particles out there in
the universe.

2661
02:15:26,220 --> 02:15:27,110
We almost.
No,

2662
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:28,950
because I think called dark matter.
Yes.

2663
02:15:28,951 --> 02:15:32,580
So we look out into the universe and we
see that there's a lot of stuff there

2664
02:15:32,581 --> 02:15:34,530
that's interacting,
gravitation Italy,

2665
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:39,300
but he's not interacting strongly with
the matter out of which we are made and

2666
02:15:39,301 --> 02:15:41,100
the stars are made.
So it,

2667
02:15:41,101 --> 02:15:44,700
it,
it's almost certain that that some form

2668
02:15:44,701 --> 02:15:48,450
of particle that that fits beautifully
and we see lots of different

2669
02:15:48,451 --> 02:15:52,920
observations the way galaxies rotate and
interact and even the oldest light in

2670
02:15:52,921 --> 02:15:54,720
the universe,
the so called cosmic microwave

2671
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:57,960
background radiation,
we see the signature of that stuff in

2672
02:15:57,961 --> 02:15:58,920
that light as well.

2673
02:15:59,430 --> 02:16:03,270
So we think that there's some of the
particle out there and to be honest,

2674
02:16:03,271 --> 02:16:08,271
we thought we would have detected it.
I think at Lhc we have lots of theories

2675
02:16:08,430 --> 02:16:12,360
called supersymmetric theories that make
predictions for all sorts of different

2676
02:16:12,370 --> 02:16:15,780
particles that would interact weekly
with normal matter.

2677
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:17,640
And I.
Yeah,

2678
02:16:17,641 --> 02:16:21,870
I think it's broadly seen as a surprise
that we haven't seen them the LAC.

2679
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:26,410
So that just may well mean that either
they're very,

2680
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:29,680
they're a bit too massive,
so we need more energy to make them.

2681
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,980
And we just haven't quite got enough.
Oh,

2682
02:16:31,981 --> 02:16:34,330
we're not making enough of them often
enough to see them,

2683
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:36,640
which is one of the reasons we're great
in the LHC.

2684
02:16:37,390 --> 02:16:41,320
So we also looked for them by the way,
I'm directly,

2685
02:16:41,410 --> 02:16:43,780
so we have experiments and the
mountains,

2686
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:45,920
we bury them in the,
in,

2687
02:16:45,970 --> 02:16:48,370
so the cosmic rays from space don't
interfere with them.

2688
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:53,220
And we're looking for the rare occasions
when these dark matter particles bumpin.

2689
02:16:53,320 --> 02:16:55,870
So the particles of matter in the
detector,

2690
02:16:56,220 --> 02:16:58,480
so it,
so the idea would be this room's full of

2691
02:16:58,481 --> 02:17:01,000
them.
I mean the galaxy is swimming with that

2692
02:17:01,001 --> 02:17:05,680
matter as far as we can tell,
but interacts very weakly with this

2693
02:17:05,710 --> 02:17:08,170
matter so it doesn't bump into us very
often.

2694
02:17:08,590 --> 02:17:12,040
So we're looking for the direct
detection of it and we're looking to

2695
02:17:12,041 --> 02:17:14,950
make those particles lhc.
So it's everywhere,

2696
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:17,640
but it doesn't interact with us very
weakly.

2697
02:17:17,730 --> 02:17:20,290
Um,
so interacts with the gravity and the,

2698
02:17:20,310 --> 02:17:20,950
the,
the,

2699
02:17:20,950 --> 02:17:23,260
the archetype or particle that's
everywhere.

2700
02:17:23,261 --> 02:17:25,510
That doesn't interact strongly as a
neutrino.

2701
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:28,480
So we do know about neutrinos.
We've detected those.

2702
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:33,780
And there there is something like 60
billion per centimeter squared per

2703
02:17:34,271 --> 02:17:38,200
second passing through your head.
Now from the sun,

2704
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:40,570
so they get made in nuclear reactions in
the sun,

2705
02:17:40,930 --> 02:17:43,660
but they go straight through your head
and then straight through the earth,

2706
02:17:44,230 --> 02:17:48,400
pretty much occasionally one of them
bumps into something and we can detect

2707
02:17:48,401 --> 02:17:51,760
those cars were so many of them are
going through,

2708
02:17:51,790 --> 02:17:52,680
but we only,
you know,

2709
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:54,970
I don't know,
one or two a day.

2710
02:17:55,660 --> 02:18:00,220
And the ideas that dark matter
encompasses an enormous percentage of

2711
02:18:00,221 --> 02:18:01,780
the universe.
Yes,

2712
02:18:01,781 --> 02:18:06,781
it's five times as much matter is dark
matter than is normal matter and the

2713
02:18:08,741 --> 02:18:12,940
number is 25 percent of the universe.
So it's roughly speaking,

2714
02:18:13,180 --> 02:18:18,180
but five percent of the university's
normal matter stars in gas,

2715
02:18:18,670 --> 02:18:20,660
25 percent is dark matter.
Yeah.

2716
02:18:20,670 --> 02:18:21,400
So that.
Yeah,

2717
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:22,210
five,
no amount.

2718
02:18:22,210 --> 02:18:24,880
About 25 dark matter and about 70 is
dark energy.

2719
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:26,630
That's the other thing.
The other thing,

2720
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:28,780
yeah.
So what the hell is that?

2721
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:32,800
I don't know know what it does.
So again,

2722
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:35,980
what we talked about Einstein's theory
earlier.

2723
02:18:35,981 --> 02:18:39,760
So Einstein's theory,
which works spectacularly well,

2724
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:43,090
says that if you put stuff into the
university,

2725
02:18:43,091 --> 02:18:46,090
we said before,
then he walks and deforms and stretches

2726
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:50,950
and it very precisely telogy given the
stuff that you put in it,

2727
02:18:50,980 --> 02:18:55,870
how much does it stretch and how does it
stretch and the the measurement we have

2728
02:18:55,871 --> 02:18:57,090
is how stretching.

2729
02:18:57,720 --> 02:19:02,230
So so we we observed the thing we
observe is how the universe is expanding

2730
02:19:02,500 --> 02:19:06,460
and how the expansion rate is changing
and how excited and how it's changed

2731
02:19:06,461 --> 02:19:09,100
over time.
So we have very precise measurements of

2732
02:19:09,101 --> 02:19:11,380
that.
So then we can use this theory to tell

2733
02:19:11,381 --> 02:19:15,640
us what's in it given that we know what,
how it's responding to that stuff.

2734
02:19:16,180 --> 02:19:18,490
And that's how we discovered dark
energy.

2735
02:19:18,730 --> 02:19:22,300
So we noticed that the university is
expansion rate is increasing.

2736
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:25,300
So university accelerating in its
expansion,

2737
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:29,960
which is exactly the opposite of what we
thought and this is in the 19 nineties

2738
02:19:29,961 --> 02:19:34,961
that we discovered that so we can work
out what sort of stuff and how much of

2739
02:19:35,151 --> 02:19:37,790
that stuff you need to put in the
universe to make that happen.

2740
02:19:38,390 --> 02:19:39,950
And that's where we get these numbers
from.

2741
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:44,150
And was there resistance to that when
that was first proposed?

2742
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:44,931
Yeah,
I'm in it.

2743
02:19:44,931 --> 02:19:47,100
My,
one of my friends that Brian Schmidt and

2744
02:19:47,110 --> 02:19:49,310
got the Nobel prize for that.
And um,

2745
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:51,950
I remember I talked to him and he said,
uh,

2746
02:19:51,951 --> 02:19:53,660
he was a Postdoc,
I think at the time,

2747
02:19:53,661 --> 02:19:57,410
so young researcher and he made it.
He's making measurements of Supernova,

2748
02:19:57,560 --> 02:20:00,800
the light from supernova explosions,
which is so bright that you can see

2749
02:20:00,801 --> 02:20:01,790
them,
you know,

2750
02:20:02,330 --> 02:20:04,130
hundreds of million,
billions of light years away.

2751
02:20:04,910 --> 02:20:06,730
And he noticed that if you look at the
data,

2752
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:11,720
the light is stretched in the wrong way.
So we look at the stretch of light as it

2753
02:20:11,721 --> 02:20:14,690
travels across the universe and the
universe is expanding.

2754
02:20:14,691 --> 02:20:17,120
It stretches the lights so it changes
the color.

2755
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:19,700
And he noticed that there was a
discrepancy,

2756
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:24,230
which we said that the universe,
that the expansion rate is speeding up.

2757
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:28,610
It's been speeding up from,
I think something like 7 billion years

2758
02:20:28,611 --> 02:20:28,710
old.

2759
02:20:28,710 --> 02:20:30,890
So it's been speeding up.
Um,

2760
02:20:31,610 --> 02:20:34,160
so he thought that he's done something
wrong because it,

2761
02:20:34,470 --> 02:20:35,300
you know,
so,

2762
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:38,000
so he checked it and checked it and
checked it and he couldn't find anything

2763
02:20:38,001 --> 02:20:40,490
wrong,
so he did what a good scientist does,

2764
02:20:40,491 --> 02:20:43,400
which he published it so that somebody
else could find out what he'd done

2765
02:20:43,401 --> 02:20:45,350
wrong.
And he said that he thought it would be

2766
02:20:45,351 --> 02:20:47,990
the end of his career.
He thought I'd be a laughing stock and

2767
02:20:47,991 --> 02:20:49,510
he got the Nobel prize because he was
right.

2768
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:52,130
It is stretch.
Wow.

2769
02:20:52,370 --> 02:20:54,360
It's a great lesson.
Means that if you,

2770
02:20:54,361 --> 02:20:57,920
if you're sure that you can't see what
you've done wrong,

2771
02:20:58,250 --> 02:21:00,410
then you publish.
It goes back to that thing about

2772
02:21:00,411 --> 02:21:03,230
humility we talked about earlier.
You know what we ultimately,

2773
02:21:03,231 --> 02:21:07,400
we're not trying to be right.
We're trying to find out stuff and so

2774
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:11,180
they're a good scientists will be really
happy if they set out to be wrong

2775
02:21:11,210 --> 02:21:12,920
because they've learned something now.

2776
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:13,620
That's the,
that's the,

2777
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:16,880
it's good that you take that path
because he got the Nobel prize now when

2778
02:21:16,881 --> 02:21:20,870
he received the Nobel prize in this
concept started being discussed,

2779
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:23,810
what was the initial reaction to it?
Well,

2780
02:21:23,811 --> 02:21:27,290
it's,
it's interesting because it's allowed in

2781
02:21:27,291 --> 02:21:30,380
Einstein's theory and it was in
Einstein's original theory,

2782
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:32,000
so it's called,
it's got a name,

2783
02:21:32,001 --> 02:21:34,600
it's called the cosmological constant,
and that's,

2784
02:21:34,620 --> 02:21:35,510
um,
it's,

2785
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:39,230
it just allowed in the equations.
And Einstein actually introduced it,

2786
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:41,990
um,
initially to,

2787
02:21:42,020 --> 02:21:47,020
because Einstein's equations strongly
suggests that the universe is expanding

2788
02:21:47,601 --> 02:21:52,601
or contracting and not just sat there.
So even before we'd observed anything,

2789
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:58,050
Einstein had a theory that suggested
that the university just not static and

2790
02:21:58,060 --> 02:22:00,590
actually really strongly suggest that
there's a beginning,

2791
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:01,970
right?
So the,

2792
02:22:01,970 --> 02:22:06,680
the theory itself on its own suggests
that you can see if the university is

2793
02:22:06,681 --> 02:22:08,990
stretching today,
that he must've been smaller in the

2794
02:22:08,991 --> 02:22:09,380
past.

2795
02:22:09,380 --> 02:22:10,760
Right now,
everything must have been closer

2796
02:22:10,761 --> 02:22:11,810
together.
Let's say that,

2797
02:22:12,470 --> 02:22:13,700
um,
so that,

2798
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:16,250
um,
as a man magical George Lemaitre,

2799
02:22:16,340 --> 02:22:19,190
who was a,
who works independently of Einstein,

2800
02:22:19,191 --> 02:22:22,730
but the same time in the early 19
twenties before we even knew there were

2801
02:22:22,731 --> 02:22:26,420
other galaxies beyond the Milky Way.
And they notice that the,

2802
02:22:26,620 --> 02:22:28,980
the equation suggests the universe might
be stretching.

2803
02:22:29,370 --> 02:22:31,830
Um,
and so he wrote to Einstein and said,

2804
02:22:31,831 --> 02:22:36,630
your theory suggests there was a day
without a yesterday because he thought

2805
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:39,600
if everything's expanding now,
then it must've been closer together in

2806
02:22:39,601 --> 02:22:42,720
the past and so there might be a time
when it was all together and he was a

2807
02:22:42,721 --> 02:22:46,050
priest.
So it's a Belgian priest.

2808
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:49,560
So I think,
I mean I wrote about this now it's kind

2809
02:22:49,561 --> 02:22:54,360
of mindset a bit,
but I think that he was more predisposed

2810
02:22:54,361 --> 02:22:58,110
to accept what the equations were
telling him because a beginning,

2811
02:22:58,460 --> 02:23:03,120
an origin for priest is really a nice
thing because it tells you the creation

2812
02:23:03,121 --> 02:23:06,690
event,
it's an Einstein try to dodge it and put

2813
02:23:06,691 --> 02:23:10,200
this allowed term into his equation,
which is the,

2814
02:23:10,201 --> 02:23:12,050
almost the stretchy tube.

2815
02:23:12,410 --> 02:23:13,620
So say,
well if it's old,

2816
02:23:13,900 --> 02:23:16,890
if it's all kind of contract in or
something,

2817
02:23:16,891 --> 02:23:19,890
can I put something in to make it
stretch a bit to balance it all out so

2818
02:23:19,891 --> 02:23:24,660
it can be eternal and you can't,
you can't make it eternal that way,

2819
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:26,430
but eat.
So he tried it,

2820
02:23:26,610 --> 02:23:29,910
they took it out and cold it.
His biggest blunder,

2821
02:23:30,550 --> 02:23:34,170
taking it,
putting it in his biggest funder,

2822
02:23:34,380 --> 02:23:39,380
or at least some people think what he'd
done was missed the prediction of the

2823
02:23:39,391 --> 02:23:40,860
big bang.
Really.

2824
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:46,080
So by trying to fiddle around to have a
static universe that stable,

2825
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:48,810
he missed what the equations were
screaming.

2826
02:23:48,811 --> 02:23:51,720
His own theory was screaming to him,
which is that no,

2827
02:23:51,721 --> 02:23:55,260
the universe expands or contracts and he
missed it.

2828
02:23:55,530 --> 02:23:57,990
Right?
So I think that's probably what he meant

2829
02:23:57,991 --> 02:24:01,320
by biggest blunder,
but in any case he took it out and then

2830
02:24:01,321 --> 02:24:04,230
later in the 19 nineties it turns out
the notes there,

2831
02:24:04,710 --> 02:24:05,820
but it's really small.

2832
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:08,610
It's tiny,
tiny effect,

2833
02:24:09,150 --> 02:24:13,230
but it's still dominating the universe
now and it will,

2834
02:24:13,350 --> 02:24:15,090
it will dominate even more in the
future.

2835
02:24:15,450 --> 02:24:20,450
So we think that we're in the universe
that will continue to expand essentially

2836
02:24:20,851 --> 02:24:24,990
doubling in size,
a fixed timescale in which is about 20

2837
02:24:24,990 --> 02:24:27,420
billion years.
So within every 20 billion years into

2838
02:24:27,421 --> 02:24:30,270
the future forever,
unless something happens,

2839
02:24:30,510 --> 02:24:35,510
the universe will continue to expand and
double in size to you.

2840
02:24:35,820 --> 02:24:37,840
And that's the dark energy is driving
them,

2841
02:24:38,010 --> 02:24:40,140
but nobody knows what it is.
It's the,

2842
02:24:40,580 --> 02:24:45,580
it's one of the cutting edge,
massive problems in theoretical physics

2843
02:24:46,350 --> 02:24:50,460
and what is being done to try to get a
better grasp of what it is.

2844
02:24:50,910 --> 02:24:52,200
Um,
and it's theoretical.

2845
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:54,810
I mean we're making very precise
observations of it,

2846
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:57,420
right?
But it looks like this constant,

2847
02:24:57,510 --> 02:25:00,330
so it looks like it's basically one a
number,

2848
02:25:00,331 --> 02:25:02,760
if you like,
in Einstein's equations and just really

2849
02:25:02,761 --> 02:25:03,594
simple.

2850
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:07,840
So it looks like it's something that may
be a property of space itself,

2851
02:25:07,841 --> 02:25:11,760
I don't know,
but it looks like a very simple thing

2852
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:15,570
that doesn't change over time and just
stays there so,

2853
02:25:15,660 --> 02:25:20,660
so it requires theoretical advance as
well.

2854
02:25:20,730 --> 02:25:23,620
And so people are trying very hard to,
to do that.

2855
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:28,390
It's so crazy when you go from Galileo
to modern theoretical physics that

2856
02:25:28,391 --> 02:25:33,391
they're still in the midst of this
understanding of what all this stuff is.

2857
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:36,370
Yeah,
I mean these,

2858
02:25:36,371 --> 02:25:37,870
uh,
you know,

2859
02:25:37,871 --> 02:25:40,930
these are fundamental and difficult
problems and we're talking about the

2860
02:25:40,931 --> 02:25:45,010
origin and evolution of the universe.
That's what it is and it,

2861
02:25:45,011 --> 02:25:47,170
and tell us a particle physics.
I mean,

2862
02:25:47,180 --> 02:25:50,110
the way that these things,
this stuff,

2863
02:25:50,111 --> 02:25:51,940
we keep talking about this stuff in the
universe,

2864
02:25:52,150 --> 02:25:57,150
that's what the lhc studies he studies
had the stuff behaves right now.

2865
02:25:57,640 --> 02:25:59,590
These are,
it's very theoretical,

2866
02:25:59,591 --> 02:25:59,960
right?

2867
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:04,000
They're trying to wrap their minds
around what this is and what the

2868
02:26:04,001 --> 02:26:07,900
properties of it or do you envision a
time where you can actually physically

2869
02:26:07,901 --> 02:26:09,580
measure this and,
and have a,

2870
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:12,670
a,
a real clear understanding of what it is

2871
02:26:12,671 --> 02:26:16,660
and what its properties.
Dark energy and I don't know.

2872
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:17,680
Um,
I mean,

2873
02:26:17,681 --> 02:26:19,240
for example,
there are theories,

2874
02:26:19,540 --> 02:26:21,820
for example,
which should probably not right,

2875
02:26:21,821 --> 02:26:25,510
but they're not necessarily wrong here.
There are theories that try to link it

2876
02:26:25,511 --> 02:26:29,190
to the Higgs particle.
So the Higgs particle which we've

2877
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:34,060
discovered and can measure has some
properties that we think the dark energy

2878
02:26:34,930 --> 02:26:38,350
would need.
And I'll this inflation I mentioned way

2879
02:26:38,351 --> 02:26:41,950
back at the start of the universe,
it has some of the properties that can

2880
02:26:41,951 --> 02:26:44,290
do that as well.
So for example,

2881
02:26:44,291 --> 02:26:47,890
there are faithfully tries to link them.
So we do have an observation of the

2882
02:26:47,891 --> 02:26:48,350
higgs.

2883
02:26:48,350 --> 02:26:50,980
We can study that.
So are they linked?

2884
02:26:51,460 --> 02:26:52,440
Don't know.
Um,

2885
02:26:52,570 --> 02:26:57,570
but so it could be that we can study it
even though it's a very small weak

2886
02:26:58,481 --> 02:27:01,860
effects and it could be web direct
access.

2887
02:27:01,870 --> 02:27:05,110
Food is great.
I mean it's just these are big mysteries

2888
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:09,940
that there's something really profound
we don't understand about the way that

2889
02:27:09,941 --> 02:27:14,380
stuff in particular.
The Higgs actually interacts with space

2890
02:27:14,381 --> 02:27:18,850
and time.
So very naively the higgs should blow

2891
02:27:18,851 --> 02:27:23,851
the universe apart just very naively.
It's loads of energy in a very small

2892
02:27:24,581 --> 02:27:27,820
amount of space and huge amounts of
energy and the higgs field,

2893
02:27:28,450 --> 02:27:31,270
but it doesn't do anything apart from
giving to things.

2894
02:27:31,660 --> 02:27:35,890
It doesn't seem to me it doesn't
directly affect space,

2895
02:27:36,730 --> 02:27:40,360
but everything else that you put in
space directly affects it.

2896
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:42,330
So,
you know,

2897
02:27:42,340 --> 02:27:45,850
there are,
there are kind of issues there that we

2898
02:27:45,851 --> 02:27:47,320
don't and it just says we don't get it.

2899
02:27:47,350 --> 02:27:49,510
We don't,
we don't get it yet.

2900
02:27:49,630 --> 02:27:52,390
It's just another one of those.
They probably late there.

2901
02:27:52,391 --> 02:27:53,500
I,
if I was to guess,

2902
02:27:53,501 --> 02:27:55,420
I'd say there's some link there,
you know,

2903
02:27:55,421 --> 02:28:00,280
there's something going on and solving
one of them might solve the other two

2904
02:28:00,580 --> 02:28:05,580
inflation higgs dark energy something.
How many people worldwide would you

2905
02:28:05,921 --> 02:28:10,540
estimate are trying to grasp this and,
and working on this?

2906
02:28:11,660 --> 02:28:12,670
A good question.
I don't know.

2907
02:28:12,671 --> 02:28:16,330
I mean it's a,
it's probably tens if that is tens of

2908
02:28:16,330 --> 02:28:17,710
thousands,
if you count all the people who work at

2909
02:28:17,711 --> 02:28:21,620
cern and the particle physicists and a
theoretical physicists,

2910
02:28:21,650 --> 02:28:23,870
it'd be tens of thousands because

2911
02:28:23,870 --> 02:28:26,740
it's,
it's so important to,

2912
02:28:27,290 --> 02:28:29,960
for us to get an understanding of what's
going on,

2913
02:28:29,961 --> 02:28:34,961
but yet so outside of the grasp of most
people including me,

2914
02:28:35,750 --> 02:28:37,640
like I'm listening to you talk about
this and I'm like,

2915
02:28:37,641 --> 02:28:40,430
thank God there's people like you thank
whatever,

2916
02:28:40,510 --> 02:28:45,200
thank quirks because people like you out
there that are doing this,

2917
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:48,170
but it,
it's almost like you're speaking another

2918
02:28:48,171 --> 02:28:50,930
language.
It's so strange to me.

2919
02:28:51,070 --> 02:28:52,790
Well,
it's very new stuff,

2920
02:28:53,290 --> 02:28:53,781
you know,
I mean,

2921
02:28:53,781 --> 02:28:57,800
even when I was at school and so when I
was at university,

2922
02:28:57,801 --> 02:29:01,760
we hadn't discovered the top quark and
we knew it was there.

2923
02:29:02,150 --> 02:29:06,140
We thought the Higgs might be there,
but we had no idea whether it was,

2924
02:29:06,141 --> 02:29:06,820
you know,
so,

2925
02:29:06,820 --> 02:29:10,670
so we were moving in my career,
we're moving quite fast.

2926
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:12,980
Um,
and yet you're right,

2927
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:16,040
these are the most fundamental questions
about what,

2928
02:29:16,041 --> 02:29:20,150
why is there ultimately why is the
universe the way it is and even possibly

2929
02:29:20,151 --> 02:29:23,840
why is there a universe right where we
were away from that yet,

2930
02:29:23,870 --> 02:29:28,870
but if we're ever going to answer that,
it will be by doing stuff like this and

2931
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:34,010
this is all addressed in this live show
that you're doing this world live show

2932
02:29:34,100 --> 02:29:38,990
and certainly the,
they also the consequences of the not

2933
02:29:38,991 --> 02:29:43,540
the country has had knowledge,
but the cosmology is terrifying that as

2934
02:29:43,550 --> 02:29:44,930
we've started with.

2935
02:29:45,550 --> 02:29:47,980
And so I think it,
as we've said it,

2936
02:29:48,420 --> 02:29:52,970
it raises questions.
It makes quite vivid questions that we

2937
02:29:52,971 --> 02:29:55,250
all have about,
you know,

2938
02:29:55,251 --> 02:29:58,240
what are,
what are we doing here like this?

2939
02:29:58,670 --> 02:30:01,340
So I try and I think this goes all the
way back to me.

2940
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:05,300
I'm really been into Carl Sagan.
He always used to try this.

2941
02:30:05,620 --> 02:30:09,320
You try,
you try to link it to things that people

2942
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:12,890
think about naturally.
Then that's why people are fascinated by

2943
02:30:12,891 --> 02:30:15,580
this stuff because they do actually
think about it.

2944
02:30:15,860 --> 02:30:19,490
It might not be with the right names,
the right words or the right facts even,

2945
02:30:19,910 --> 02:30:22,010
but they're thinking about how did I get
here,

2946
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:25,400
how did I come to exist,
what is the future?

2947
02:30:25,730 --> 02:30:28,260
Do we have a future?
What was our past year?

2948
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:30,620
These,
these are universal questions.

2949
02:30:30,621 --> 02:30:34,730
I think there certainly are and the way
you're doing this with your live show,

2950
02:30:34,731 --> 02:30:38,570
you were saying that you have an
enormous visual aspect to it as well.

2951
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:40,390
We have a.
we,

2952
02:30:41,050 --> 02:30:44,060
we have the biggest screen we can get in
every venue and it's led.

2953
02:30:44,061 --> 02:30:46,470
It's one of the state of the art modern
led screen,

2954
02:30:46,471 --> 02:30:51,110
so they're like Lego and you can build
them so you fill the venue with it so

2955
02:30:51,190 --> 02:30:55,880
you know at Wembley arena than it's 30
meters wide by eight meters high.

2956
02:30:55,881 --> 02:30:58,490
It's enormous.
You must have a huge crew carrying all

2957
02:30:58,491 --> 02:31:02,060
this stuff for 16 or 18 people and it's
like a rock and roll show.

2958
02:31:02,900 --> 02:31:05,810
Some of the venues,
we do it in North America that in Canada

2959
02:31:05,811 --> 02:31:09,770
that there are a bit smaller venues,
but we just fill it with screen as much

2960
02:31:09,770 --> 02:31:11,300
as we can get.
And then the graphics,

2961
02:31:11,301 --> 02:31:15,500
a lot of the graphics I,
I have were done by a day neg who did x

2962
02:31:15,501 --> 02:31:20,230
Makena actually an interstellar.
And the reason I chose,

2963
02:31:20,290 --> 02:31:22,620
I chose them,
I rang them up and goes,

2964
02:31:22,621 --> 02:31:24,150
please,
please will you do this.

2965
02:31:24,630 --> 02:31:25,870
And they said,
which one have you got?

2966
02:31:25,900 --> 02:31:28,230
And you know,
because it's way lower than Chris Nolan.

2967
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:29,333
Yeah,
they did it.

2968
02:31:29,830 --> 02:31:32,310
They were really,
they just liked the idea of these

2969
02:31:32,311 --> 02:31:34,110
messages and these ideas.
So they,

2970
02:31:34,170 --> 02:31:38,190
they use the software that they use for
interstellar to create images of black

2971
02:31:38,191 --> 02:31:43,191
holes and they use general relativity.
They coded it into the so that graphic

2972
02:31:45,041 --> 02:31:48,030
software,
so they can rate trace lights around

2973
02:31:48,031 --> 02:31:51,810
black holes and you can move the camera
around the black hole and it traces the

2974
02:31:51,811 --> 02:31:54,720
way or the light moves around it.
So if you remember those amazing,

2975
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:57,330
the Gargantua,
the black hole interstellar,

2976
02:31:57,810 --> 02:31:59,490
that's,
that's a simulation.

2977
02:31:59,491 --> 02:32:03,180
It's not an artist's impression,
is a simulation of what Einstein's

2978
02:32:03,181 --> 02:32:05,220
theory tells us a black coal will look
like.

2979
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:09,630
And so I can use that to talk about what
happens when you fall into a black hole.

2980
02:32:09,690 --> 02:32:14,310
What would you see watching someone fall
in and you can explain all that using

2981
02:32:14,311 --> 02:32:18,210
Einstein's theory now,
the idea that it's kind of a well known

2982
02:32:18,211 --> 02:32:19,900
idea.
It's a bizarre idea that if,

2983
02:32:20,210 --> 02:32:22,860
if I was to fall into a black hole and
you were watching,

2984
02:32:23,190 --> 02:32:28,080
you'd never seen me fall in.
You'd see time slow down my time,

2985
02:32:28,081 --> 02:32:31,200
slow down as you watched me.
So in the end I just slow down,

2986
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:32,250
slow down,
slow down,

2987
02:32:32,480 --> 02:32:37,290
and then I get frozen on the event
horizon and just fade away as an image

2988
02:32:37,310 --> 02:32:42,310
or reddening image on the event horizon.
So time passes at different rates as you

2989
02:32:42,691 --> 02:32:46,650
move closer to the black hole and
faraway because space and time of

2990
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:51,480
distorted by the mass of the black hole.
And so I can I talk about all that,

2991
02:32:51,481 --> 02:32:55,860
but I talk about all that with this
incredible image which we had.

2992
02:32:56,400 --> 02:32:58,440
It's so high resolution by the way that
they.

2993
02:32:58,441 --> 02:33:02,090
It was higher resolution than they're
used for interstellar cause my screen's

2994
02:33:02,100 --> 02:33:05,700
so big so we need a special machine to
play it.

2995
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:11,000
You can buy the most expensive Mac pro
in the world and it will not play this

2996
02:33:11,581 --> 02:33:13,080
stuff.
I love that.

2997
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:14,820
From a Geek perspective,
brilliant.

2998
02:33:14,821 --> 02:33:18,480
You have to have a special video player
to play the damn thing.

2999
02:33:18,481 --> 02:33:21,720
It was just like a series of CPU is all
attached together in some sort of a

3000
02:33:21,721 --> 02:33:23,070
super cute.
Yeah.

3001
02:33:23,071 --> 02:33:25,890
It's one of those is a big sort of
visualization graphics.

3002
02:33:25,891 --> 02:33:27,090
Things were,
but these files,

3003
02:33:27,110 --> 02:33:27,790
like you know,
they don't.

3004
02:33:27,790 --> 02:33:31,680
Twenty gig video files because there's
so many pixels.

3005
02:33:32,030 --> 02:33:33,630
The pixels.
This is really geeky in it.

3006
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:36,780
The fix the regulation.
Six thousand 400 by 15,

3007
02:33:36,810 --> 02:33:38,940
36,
seven screens.

3008
02:33:40,520 --> 02:33:42,160
It's a lot.
Yeah,

3009
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:45,120
it's a lot.
They're huge files.

3010
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:50,240
Are you coming to Los Angeles with this?
When the Taliban theater in May,

3011
02:33:50,470 --> 02:33:53,480
the end of May.
I'm there if I'm here or there it.

3012
02:33:53,640 --> 02:33:54,090
Oh yeah,
no,

3013
02:33:54,090 --> 02:33:55,770
you got to come 24th of May.
Oh,

3014
02:33:55,771 --> 02:33:59,520
you're in San Diego as well today.
I got to see one of these.

3015
02:33:59,790 --> 02:34:02,550
Go to one of the.
It's going to be great fun and however

3016
02:34:02,551 --> 02:34:06,300
much stuff we can fit into those two
handsome devil,

3017
02:34:06,330 --> 02:34:07,560
look at that.
Nice jacket on.

3018
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:08,790
Looking good.
So yeah,

3019
02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:12,640
someone gave me that actually of.
Well,

3020
02:34:12,660 --> 02:34:16,710
it's cool because cool guy.
Cool guy with space behind you.

3021
02:34:16,910 --> 02:34:17,560
Yeah.
Wow.

3022
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:18,250
That's awesome

3023
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:19,360
man.
Well listen,

3024
02:34:19,390 --> 02:34:22,150
thank you so much for doing this.
I really appreciate you.

3025
02:34:22,151 --> 02:34:24,250
Appreciate everything you're doing so
awesome.

3026
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:25,150
No,
thank you.

3027
02:34:25,150 --> 02:34:28,000
I always enjoy [inaudible].
I loved it last time and people still

3028
02:34:28,001 --> 02:34:31,450
talk about it when I was on last time.
The more people ask me about meeting you

3029
02:34:31,810 --> 02:34:36,310
than virtually anybody else will say get
rid of because it's like 100 times more

3030
02:34:36,311 --> 02:34:39,280
popular than it was back then.
It's going to be very strange now,

3031
02:34:39,281 --> 02:34:40,950
but thank you again.
Really appreciate it.

3032
02:34:40,960 --> 02:34:42,580
I can't wait to see your show.
Thank you so much.

3033
02:34:42,581 --> 02:34:43,420
Thank you.
Thank you.

3034
02:34:44,110 --> 02:34:44,740
Bye everybody.
