1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,980
5 4 3 2 1.
Now we're live yes.

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,410
Hello.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,690
Hello.
What's happenin.

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,800
Not much I'm excited to be here.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,100
I'm excited to have you here.
Your father speaks very highly of you.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,830
That's good.
What is it like to have Jordan Peterson

7
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:22,780
as a dad.
Is it weird you have to check yourself

8
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:27,490
constantly and make sure you're on.
Your unsteady ground and I say anything

9
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:28,090
ridiculous.

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,770
No not at all.
Not at all.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,970
I didn't realize it was weird until I
went away to university and then kind

12
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:37,150
of.
So I just I was away for a while and

13
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:40,120
then when I came back to the house
especially because the house is full of

14
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:44,500
like paintings and masks and statues and
like 32 different paint colors and I

15
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:47,740
came back and was like oh maybe he's a
bit eccentric.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,790
Now he's definitely IG centric.
We were talking off air about what it

17
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:59,791
was like to watch your dad become famous
and become famous and in his 50s right.

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,190
Like yeah I hope fifty four fifty five.

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,170
That's when he became famous before that
relatively unknown respected professor.

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,620
One issue with this one transgender Bill
the the preferred pronouns bill and then

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,233
boom.

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,140
Off to the races.
Yeah strange it was.

23
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,880
Yeah it was super weird especially how
the media was portraying him and how

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,480
what was actually happening at the
events wasn't what was being portrayed

25
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:31,030
in the media.
So that was weird to watch and then

26
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:33,520
people recognizing him on the street is
strange.

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,553
Yes.

28
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,680
When you say what what happened in real
life was not was what was being

29
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,880
portrayed like what was different.

30
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,920
Mostly what he was saying.
So most of what he said is on film

31
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,880
anyway so you can go to YouTube and see
what he's been saying like not there's

32
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:51,490
not like some secret that's going
around.

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,570
But what's been portrayed has been so
much more negative than what he's

34
00:01:55,571 --> 00:02:00,571
actually said or they'll take like sound
bites and just weave a story that isn't

35
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,370
quite true.
Which I didn't read for some reason I

36
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,000
know it looks silly but for some reason
I just thought that what the media was

37
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:11,230
portraying was honest always.
Yeah yeah me too.

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,120
Yeah yeah.
And it's not.

39
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,190
Well the writers you know and what's
there's real issue today that that issue

40
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,940
I've talked about this before but the
issue is clicks Yeah.

41
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,900
It's not just about what's the facts of
the story.

42
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,930
It's about these publications are
struggling to stay alive.

43
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,920
And one of the only ways that they can
get people to click on stories is

44
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,250
salacious headlines real make things
really click baby.

45
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,160
And that's what they focus on and they
focus on negative aspects that are going

46
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,480
to get people riled up.
They have to have an angle.

47
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,590
And I've talked to people who are
writers who will write something and

48
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:51,910
then I'll talk to them and I'll say Hey
man this is not what we talked about or

49
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,770
what happened.
And they said I'm going to be honest

50
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:55,750
with you.
I didn't even write that the headline

51
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:59,740
was completely written by the editor.
So the editor came and changed it all up

52
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,890
changed this switch put some dot dot dot
side of things you know.

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,240
So cut off sentences so that they seemed
more you know just more controversial

54
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:14,260
than they really are because they didn't
allow the counterpoint of you know

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,220
sometimes you say something and they say
or it could be this or the or it could

56
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,510
be this part is cut out.

57
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,930
You know they do things like that just
to stay alive because I think when you I

58
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,780
mean really big publications whether
it's the New York Times or whether you

59
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,900
know the Boston Globe like big
publications are struggling for their

60
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:35,770
life right now because people who want
to buy newspapers anymore and you know

61
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:40,240
and getting people to read things online
is very difficult and you have to you

62
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:43,660
have to do something salacious.
You have to do something that's enticing

63
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:44,540
for them to click on it.

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,870
Yeah.
Gasp and I wouldn't you say that's just

65
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:49,450
driving them down.
Yeah yeah.

66
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,110
Yeah they're fucked.
It's a bad place to be.

67
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:53,770
Yeah.

68
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,940
And I think it's you know it opens up
the door for alternative media.

69
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,400
But some of those alternative media
sources don't have journalistic

70
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:06,100
integrity either.
So that it becomes a real issue.

71
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,520
You know that's that's a problem with
lot of online news shows.

72
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,140
It's like they take a very obvious
editorial spin as well on the news.

73
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,680
And if you just read or watch their show
you would go oh well it's this way

74
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,830
because these guys are saying it's this
way.

75
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,720
But it might not be that way.
There's no real objective source is very

76
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:32,950
hard to find a good objective source.
I mean sometimes I count on the New York

77
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:36,760
Times but there's been some things that
I've read from The New York Times that I

78
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:37,240
know or not.

79
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,730
I think they had a terrible article
about Dad.

80
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,950
Oh yeah.
Like June or something.

81
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,240
Yeah.

82
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,240
He didn't make it any easier on himself
by using that forced monogamy or term no

83
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,630
enforced monogamy argument or term
because I don't I don't even with the

84
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,760
when you understand it as a
psychological concept that it is a

85
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,900
culturally enforced idea.
I still don't think that applies to in

86
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,590
cells.
I don't I just don't you know only it

87
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:09,520
makes any difference at all and he and I
discussed it on the podcast you're not

88
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:14,470
just because you say it's a good idea
and the culture agrees it's a good idea

89
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:17,410
for people to be monogamous I don't
necessarily think that that is going to

90
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:20,410
help these guys at all.
I don't think we know what's going to

91
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:25,120
help those guys.
Yeah well obviously they're all

92
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:30,010
individuals and their situations vary
but when we're talking about people like

93
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,820
what the fuck are they talking about.
There was a quote in The New York Times

94
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:38,821
where this woman was asking him what to
do about these in cells which are

95
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,970
involuntary celibate and one of them had
driven a car into a crowd of people and

96
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:49,360
killed a bunch of people because he was
frustrated because he couldn't find a

97
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:50,194
mate.

98
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,530
And your dad suggested that
if culturally enforced monogamy would be

99
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,690
perhaps a solution for that and then a
bunch of you went crazy saying that like

100
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:04,270
women.
He's saying that women should sacrifice

101
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:08,620
themselves fuck these guys that they
don't drive cars in the crowds.

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,240
Yes.
Yeah.

103
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,420
It was the whole everybody made a
mistake.

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,913
Yeah.
Yeah.

105
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,650
I don't see there's an answer for those
guys.

106
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,270
I really don't.
But now with that but that is that those

107
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:26,920
kind of articles are like the editorial
articles and opinion articles.

108
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,410
It's really it's a different thing than
reporting on the news right.

109
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,320
Yeah I thought I thought so honesty was
always a big thing in our house and was

110
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:38,920
like Don't lie because if you lie
eventually the lie will surface and will

111
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:42,700
be so much bigger than the how you get
from telling the truth.

112
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,740
So I kind of just assumed that the media
did that.

113
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,320
Yeah the world just worked like that.
Yeah no.

114
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,730
Now I know that now.
Yeah

115
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,810
.
So you and your dad a bolt on this wacky

116
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:03,811
diet you're both on this wacky carnivore
diet and this is probably one of the

117
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:09,541
most controversial things in our
relationship in relation to food today.

118
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,370
When.
When people discuss diets you know

119
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:19,540
there's a lot of people that are
vegetarian or vegan or try and ketogenic

120
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:24,541
diet or paleo but when you say carnivore
that is one of the ones where people

121
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:30,610
just universally seem to like step back
roll their eyes.

122
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,500
Most people don't think it's a good
idea.

123
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,120
They don't even know why they don't
think it's a good idea.

124
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,690
And then you tell them about people like
you or my friend Chris Bell who has

125
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,340
similar autoimmune issues and he's had
hip to hip replacements.

126
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,780
He's only 36 now and I think he had both
of them done by the time he was 30

127
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,670
right.
Pretty sure because he's had them for

128
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,671
quite a few years you know massive joint
pain of all sorts of issue and you when

129
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,610
did you got a hip replacement.
How old were you.

130
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,090
Seventeen and an ankle replacement.
Seventeen.

131
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,260
Days is a rough year.

132
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,090
That's crazy.
What do you so your whole life.

133
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,880
You've had arthritis issues or.

134
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,190
Yeah.
So I started walking kind of funny when

135
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:22,650
I was two.
According to my mom and she brought me

136
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:26,730
to the doctor and they said just having
growing pains or something when I was 7

137
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:31,200
I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis and I had like 37 joints

138
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:34,090
affected.
And then I was put on immunosuppressants

139
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:34,860
in Grade 4.

140
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,910
So I was actually the first kid in
Canada to be put on this biologic called

141
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:43,911
Enbrel goes on and roll and methotrexate
for ever like leading up to the hip an

142
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:48,450
ankle replacement and they did help
reduce some of the pain but I still

143
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:53,280
ended up with no cartilage in my joint
and hip my hip and ankle when I was 17

144
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,020
and this is just from the effects of
arthritis and the inflammation swelling

145
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:00,810
and just to the cartilage.

146
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,190
So I wasn't even particularly swollen I
didn't have a very inflammatory visually

147
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:12,330
inflammatory arthritis so my
rheumatologist who had been at Sick Kids

148
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:16,950
for 20 years said that I had the worst
arthritis she'd ever seen.

149
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,260
So it was very severe.
It wasn't particularly like swollen my

150
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,660
joints just disintegrated
Wow.

151
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,920
Mm hmm.
What do they think causes something like

152
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:28,430
this.

153
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,230
They didn't know.
So it was.

154
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,570
Eventually after the hip and ankle
replacement the diagnosis was changed to

155
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,240
juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

156
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,100
So it was literally like we don't know
well.

157
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,760
And
how did you go from these medications

158
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,120
pharmaceutical medications to getting
into this carnivore diet thing.

159
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,020
What was this.
This path.

160
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,600
Well OK I'll give you a background of
the path.

161
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,760
We were very like science oriented
especially dad.

162
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,560
So even though mom kind of wanted to
delve into diet and was like we should

163
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:11,210
go sugar free or stop eating you know
whatever make sure you'd whole grains

164
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:16,211
like all that stuff we never gave diet.
A chance because there was no scientific

165
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:22,661
evidence for it.
So I basically got sicker and sicker and

166
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:27,470
sicker and I ended up by the time I got
to university I ended up with arthritis

167
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,350
I was severely depressed.
I was on anti-depressants as well.

168
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,930
I had idiopathic hyper Sonia I was
sleeping about 18 hours a day.

169
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,040
My whole body was itchy all the time.
That started when I was about 14

170
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,460
and so that was when I started
university and then my diet just got

171
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:50,420
disastrous in university and I was like
drinking all the time and eating like

172
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:51,650
pizza and beer.

173
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,160
And I gained like 30 pounds in the first
year.

174
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,410
And ginger ale a lot of ginger ale.
Anyway I gained about 30 pounds in the

175
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:03,230
first year.
My mental health declined even further.

176
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,410
And I didn't really know what was going
on.

177
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,790
And then I started getting skin issues
so I started getting rashes cystic acne

178
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,590
and I was like OK I can deal with like
four really awful health problems but I

179
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,890
can't deal with things affecting my skin
on top of that.

180
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,400
There's too many things.
I went to dermatologists and they

181
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:27,401
basically told me I was anxious and like
causing these rashes by itching so that

182
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:32,330
was the dermatologists opinion which is
very unhelpful.

183
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,890
Anyway I spent a lot of time.
I was eventually prescribed Adderall for

184
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:41,390
the hyper sommelier.
So I spent all my time googling reading

185
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:44,600
papers trying to get a background on
skin disorders.

186
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,470
And eventually I came across this Celiac
Disease rash online and that's what I

187
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:54,770
had it looked exactly the same.
So I cut out gluten.

188
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,640
I read a whole bunch about the effects
of gluten on the guide and thought oh

189
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,640
there's actually some evidence that
gluten isn't good for people why aren't

190
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:05,180
people being told this like why didn't
my doctor test me for celiac disease

191
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,100
because Celiac Disease couples with
autoimmune disorders all the time like

192
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,500
they test type 1 kids for celiac
disease.

193
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,770
But for some reason they don't test kids
with arthritis for celiac disease.

194
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,540
So kind of gluten and that kind of
helped maybe like 20 percent but it was

195
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,270
hard to tell because it was the summer
was like maybe I'm just feeling better

196
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:26,060
from the summer.
My rash kind of went down but it was

197
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:31,061
still there and then.
So September 2015 my mom dragged me to a

198
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:36,200
natural path and they gave me the sheet
of foods like try this elimination diet.

199
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,290
And I looked at the sheet and thought
this doesn't make any sense like why can

200
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,260
I eat lemons and not oranges and why are
almonds on there but other nuts are off.

201
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,890
So I cut.
So I thought OK I'm going to do an

202
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,230
elimination diet which I didn't believe
in at all.

203
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,980
I'll cut down to what I considered safe
foods.

204
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,250
And I had no idea what I was doing.
So I just thought OK vegetables are

205
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:59,060
pretty safe I'll get rid of nightshade
because people talk about them being bad

206
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:04,130
like cheese was nitrates next to AIDS
like tomatoes eggplant those kind of

207
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:07,700
foods for some reason there.
I just knew that they were then referred

208
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:11,570
to as nitrates.
I feel like literally everybody has

209
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:13,170
heard them referred to as Nightshade.

210
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,450
No.
Have you heard them.

211
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,280
I've heard the term but not.
I couldn't tell you what it was.

212
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,010
I wouldn't have been able to say it as
an eggplant so I think maybe it's just

213
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,170
kids don't make it to the end.
I don't think so.

214
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,220
No.
Oh okay.

215
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,280
Well at the YouTube comments.
Decide.

216
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,120
Don't let them decide okay.
It's like calling demons for help too

217
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,953
good.

218
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,680
Anyway I cut down so I was eating mostly
like green vegetables.

219
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,270
I was still eating rice at that point
because I thought everybody eats rice

220
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,000
rice is safe and meat but I cut out like
dairy.

221
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,510
Most grains soy sugar processed foods
and then in the next month my joints got

222
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,840
way better and my skin healed and my
skin never healed like for a couple of

223
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:06,880
years.
I'd always have these flare ups and

224
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,730
never went away.
And that was just on a like relatively

225
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:13,920
low carb diet just like just less.
I don't know.

226
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,580
I was still eating rice right.
But it was still mostly meat and

227
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:20,810
vegetables and I thought OK maybe
there's something to this.

228
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:26,050
And then I made almond flour gluten free
sugar free dairy free almond flour

229
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,060
banana muffins and I ate a bunch of
those one night and I woke up and the

230
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:34,550
next day my wrists were sore and I
thought

231
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,530
OK maybe that's weird.

232
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,740
And then I had a bunch more than muffins
because the muffins were good and and

233
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:47,841
then I went away to college that weekend
and I couldn't walk because of my knees

234
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,680
and I never had flare ups that badly
like I used to get my shoulder was

235
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:56,460
always sore when I slept so I took
Tylenol three at night for sleeping and

236
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:59,730
my wrists were stiff but I never had
like a flare up like I couldn't walk.

237
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,060
So that was that weekend.
So then I went back to the diet and got

238
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,180
really strict with it and then things
were better like my skin was better I I

239
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,190
lost.
This was weird.

240
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,220
I lost five pounds which wasn't a lot
but I went down three pant sizes so it

241
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,860
was all bloating that I didn't realize
was bloating because it never

242
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:26,250
fluctuated.
So that was the first month and then

243
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,750
2015 and then I started trying to
reintroduce foods because I was having

244
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:34,290
cravings and I missed going out to eat
with my friends and everything.

245
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,450
So I tried to read the first thing I
tried to reintroduce was sour patch

246
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:44,451
Candy because I was having really
intense sugar look at me like that I was

247
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:48,410
having really intense sugar cravings and
I looked at the packet and I thought OK

248
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,450
no one's allergic to sugar there's no
dairy there's no gluten there's no soy.

249
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,780
This will be fine.
And I really wanted to eat them and I

250
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:02,781
had those and the next day my whole body
was itchy again and it was like like

251
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:08,361
mosquito bites everywhere itchy.
So I thought OK maybe maybe that was a

252
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:10,590
bad idea.
So I waited a couple of weeks and I

253
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:14,130
tried to reintroduce almond butter
organic almond butter because I wanted

254
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:19,131
something fast protein fast and then I
had a slight abdominal cramping diarrhea

255
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,960
then this itch came back to Jesus
Christ.

256
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,950
Yeah.

257
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,420
So for the next year
well I'll slow down.

258
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,660
We've got some time.
That was that was the almond butter.

259
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,400
So then I waited a while and I felt
pretty good.

260
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,270
This was November 2015.
And then I started feeling really good

261
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,770
and I went off of my anti-depressants
and I had been taking anti-depressants

262
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:48,830
since I was in grade 5 a really high
dose of an SSRI which had been very

263
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:51,474
helpful.

264
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,260
But do you wean yourself off and do it
under a doctor's supervision.

265
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,240
No I didn't.
You didn't right.

266
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,190
I weaned myself down so I went down to
half and then I went to a quarter and

267
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:05,410
then I went to an eighth and then I
stopped taking how long to wait time.

268
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,100
It was nothing really.
Over two weeks it was two weeks.

269
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,880
Yeah.
I didn't have withdrawal symptoms like I

270
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,220
think maybe I was lucky that way.
And so you died at this point was so at

271
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:20,750
that point I was eating rice
occasionally but it was mostly like

272
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,810
broccoli salad chicken beef fish you
know olive oil apple cider vinegar salt

273
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:31,230
pepper
at that point I was also eating pears

274
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:35,820
and apples.
So it was kind of like paleo kind of

275
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,670
very restricted paleo dairy free.

276
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,440
And so you're feeling good you're off
your medication your joints feel better.

277
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,480
No more rashes no more rashes Yeah.

278
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,960
So everything seems to be improving.
I was shocked when the depression lifted

279
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,920
because I thought that runs in my family
that's familial we have some sort of

280
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,490
brain chemistry problem that can't
possibly be diet.

281
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,960
I thought I thought the skin maybe that
was diet because this gluten link and

282
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:05,430
then maybe because of the celiac gene
that I got tested for maybe the

283
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:08,670
arthritis was part of that but I never
thought mood was associated with it.

284
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,750
So that was a surprise in November.
Anyway I went off of the

285
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:17,610
anti-depressants and then I'm about a
month later I tried to reintroduce soy

286
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,060
and this is when things started getting
really weird that year.

287
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,560
So I was having are you reintroducing
things if you're having all these

288
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,880
positive benefits.

289
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,200
I was having cravings like crazy and I
would miss eating out and I thought

290
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,460
there were probably like four or five
foods I was really sensitive to and if I

291
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:37,890
could just figure out what they were I
could eat pretty normally.

292
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,140
I didn't realize like I didn't know what
was going on.

293
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,150
If I had known I would have done it much
different.

294
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,340
But I tried to reintroduce soy because
at that point I still thought soy was a

295
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:53,341
health food.
So I ate a huge meal of like at a mommy

296
00:18:55,061 --> 00:18:59,800
beans and bean sprouts and miso soup
that I made myself.

297
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,260
So it was gluten free and soy sauce and
tofu.

298
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,320
I literally aid soy in every form and I
had the same kind of reaction with

299
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,530
almond butter.
I had immediately got bloated I had

300
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,850
diarrhea like within maybe 20 30 minutes
of eating it.

301
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,180
And I thought OK that's OK I guess I
can't eat soy.

302
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,660
And then about four hours later my legs
got edgy and then my whole body got

303
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:27,570
itchy and I was like OK that sucks I'm
clearly I'm reacting to soy.

304
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:33,110
And then the next morning the depression
came back and it came back like that was

305
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,990
the worst depressive experience I've
ever had.

306
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,420
I was medication free and it came back
in the morning and I got in the shower

307
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:46,890
and I just like I bawled in the shower
and thought how could I be so naive to

308
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:50,640
think that my horrible auto immune
disorder and the depression and

309
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:54,450
everything was caused by food like what
an idiotic thing to think how could I be

310
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:57,330
that hopeful and then I had to remind
myself OK.

311
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,140
No you ate a whole bunch of this food
then you had this like digestive

312
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:03,330
distress then you got itchy.

313
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,360
And now the depression is back.
There's clearly a pattern here.

314
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,760
It was hard to think like that when I
got that depressed so that day was like

315
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:15,360
I spent a lot of that day crying.
Then the next day got worse.

316
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,260
And this is this is when it gets weird.
So that night I went over to my parents

317
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:24,900
and I was just like I don't know what's
going on right.

318
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,100
And they're like Well don't take a car
back to your apartment.

319
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,090
I said I don't think I can drive like I
can't I just can't think I don't know

320
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:38,091
what's going on.
So my brother drove me home and I was

321
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,960
like on the verge of having a panic
attack for no reason writers just like

322
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:45,540
my heart rate was increasing I was
trying to find my keys and I turned

323
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:49,860
around to look at my brother in the car
and

324
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:56,430
his head was a like a kind of a demon.
This

325
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,660
I know how this sounds but he had like a
demon head for about a second and a half

326
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,650
and he looked at me and then he turned
and then it was my brother again.

327
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,150
So standing is what your.
For like a Yeah about a second and a

328
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:13,810
half the hallucinations that year yes.
Before that.

329
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,010
No.
That year.

330
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,360
Yeah.
After this I'll get into.

331
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,130
So you eat soy and started tripping.

332
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,440
Yeah.
Two days later.

333
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,460
I know how it sounds.
That's how it sounded to me too.

334
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,630
Have you found comparable stories.
So.

335
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:35,110
So obviously I did as much research as I
could possibly do to soy no to gluten.

336
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,470
To people who are schizophrenic from
gluten.

337
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,180
Yeah there are people with celiac
disease who have schizophrenia induced

338
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:47,810
by gluten.
So I found that but I didn't find

339
00:21:47,811 --> 00:21:49,370
anything for other foods.

340
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,450
But the skills of schizophrenia include
hallucinations rarely visual.

341
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,560
But I did find a case study of a woman
who was seeing demons from her Celiac

342
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:01,490
Disease gluten.

343
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,060
Now when you say you looked over and you
saw your brother and his head was a

344
00:22:05,061 --> 00:22:10,061
demon had like describe it like no I
found them.

345
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,310
No it was like eat.
You know when it's really dark in a

346
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:18,400
room.
And I don't know if you've experienced

347
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:21,520
this but it's really dark in the room.
And then you kind of kind of see things

348
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:22,810
in the dark.
Mm hmm.

349
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,440
It was more like that.
It was dark at night and it was like I

350
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:29,440
was so anxious so distraught.

351
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,680
You're a mess and maybe you just caused
yourself to while something idea okay.

352
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,490
Yeah I mean I saw it like I can remember
what it looks like but it wasn't a vivid

353
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,640
demon or something.
It was like but it was there okay.

354
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,300
So you're freaking out.
I'm so I'm freaking out so I'm like OK

355
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,640
that's not good.
I find my keys and I go upstairs and

356
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:52,120
then I went into my bedroom and shut the
blinds turned on all the lights.

357
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,680
And then like smoked as much weed as I
could possibly smoke to try and calm

358
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:59,350
myself down and then hid under the
blankets all night.

359
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,910
I would think that would be the worst
thing to do.

360
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:01,750
A demon.

361
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,750
You'd think that but then if you I've
had that comment before but enough and

362
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,140
it calm me down.
Okay.

363
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:15,810
So then I spent the next couple of weeks
basically stoned because I didn't know

364
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:18,880
when it was going to end.
I didn't know what was going on and I

365
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:21,640
couldn't find anybody on the internet
who had had the same experience as me

366
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,940
and then about two and a half weeks
later it started going away.

367
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,990
And so you say it.

368
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,040
You mean the depression.

369
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,100
Depression the arthritis.
It wasn't that just the depression that

370
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,760
came that's just just the words I know I
didn't go back.

371
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,180
I mean I need soy again but I went back
to the initial diet.

372
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:46,210
I was eating so essentially just this
one meal this one great meal of soy

373
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,590
threw you off for a couple of weeks
right.

374
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,180
Yeah like almost for like three weeks
but after two weeks it started getting

375
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,780
better.
But the symptoms were like So that's

376
00:23:56,781 --> 00:24:01,310
deplorable the itching started I had
bloating and then the depression came

377
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:03,320
back.
And then about a week later my skin

378
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:08,210
started breaking out.
And then maybe ten days later my

379
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:11,950
arthritis came back.
So I wrote all my symptoms down every

380
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:16,160
day because I was going crazy and I
didn't know what was going on and I

381
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:19,050
wanted to write it down to see what was
going on.

382
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,890
OK.
So then I started lifting and I started

383
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:26,891
feeling better again and I was like OK
thank God that's over and then waited

384
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,830
while things were good again.
My symptoms went away.

385
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,360
And then over the next year I tried to
reintroduce foods over and over and over

386
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:40,361
again and I was making it like I tried
whey protein powder and that didn't

387
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,070
help.
Nothing ever got to as bad as that soy

388
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:47,090
experience but I had a number of other
experiences where it was the worst

389
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:52,091
depression I've ever experienced and it
was on the verge of seeing like I don't

390
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:56,760
know seeing faces and things.

391
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,980
So you're having all these health
issues.

392
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,290
How do you get to the carnivore diet.

393
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,080
So I decide about a year later I decide
hey maybe I don't want to keep cycling

394
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:09,480
in and out of a horrible autoimmune
mental problems maybe I'll just stick

395
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:10,930
with the original diet.
Mm hmm.

396
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,460
And then I got pregnant and so then my
auto immune symptoms flared again during

397
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:20,870
the pregnancy.
Yeah like right away as soon as I found

398
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:24,080
out I was pregnant it was like before I
found out I was pregnant that my

399
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:26,840
autoimmune symptoms came back so my legs
were itchy again.

400
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,840
I was.
My joints were stiff my skin was

401
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:34,010
breaking out my anxiety was back and it
was hard to tell Well what part of this

402
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:36,470
is pregnancy and what part of this is an
autoimmune disorder.

403
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,620
So throughout my pregnancy I cut down on
all the carbs I was eating so I cut out

404
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:47,540
fruit and cut out sweet potatoes I went
down to meat and greens and I think dad

405
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,790
was on here one time and he was on a
meat and greens diet.

406
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,370
So that was doing that part.
So we're both on the meat and greens

407
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:57,371
diet mostly because we didn't realize
you didn't need Greens to survive so we

408
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:03,951
were eating meat greens and then I have
to say mostly because we realize you

409
00:26:04,751 --> 00:26:06,420
didn't well means we didn't love.

410
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,530
We didn't realize meat only wasn't
organized.

411
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:10,803
Yeah.
Yeah.

412
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,460
We hadn't realized that we didn't know
that.

413
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,230
So as meat and salad it was very simple
salad with like olive oil apple cider

414
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:22,231
vinegar salt pepper cucumbers lettuces
spinach pretty simple salad.

415
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:28,380
And then meat and fish so we did that
for about a year and then I had my

416
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:33,640
daughter and then I didn't get better.
So then I found out OK.

417
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,040
So these symptoms aren't really
pregnancy related it's just me now and

418
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:40,160
for some reason I've lost the tolerance
to these foods I used to be able to eat

419
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,270
and and you're just eating salad and
meat.

420
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,130
Yeah and I'm still having autoimmune so
now it's symptoms that you used to have

421
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,023
not in your reading.

422
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:54,500
Not reason not nearly as bad not nearly
as bad like my fatigue wasn't back.

423
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,290
My anxiety was manageable without
medication.

424
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,620
But you hadn't achieved the levels of.
I didn't know that you had.

425
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,100
Yeah.
You were eliminating things from your

426
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:04,934
diet earlier.

427
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,810
Yeah.
Exactly.

428
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,990
Exactly.
Like I reached a really good point and

429
00:27:08,991 --> 00:27:11,180
then I got pregnant and I couldn't reach
that point again.

430
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,380
So then this is 2017 so it's like
November and I'm getting really

431
00:27:17,391 --> 00:27:20,660
frustrated about being itchy.
I'm just randomly itchy again and

432
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:23,950
randomly early read about eating meat
and veg just means salad.

433
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,410
Yeah.
And I thought OK maybe I just have an

434
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:29,900
autoimmune disorder and I can't control
it with diet anymore.

435
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,770
Maybe this maybe I'm just stuck like
this.

436
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,780
And so I googled like out of
desperation.

437
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,620
I think I Googled allergic to everything
food wise something like that into

438
00:27:39,621 --> 00:27:43,070
google and I found the story about
Charlene Anderson who's been mentioned a

439
00:27:43,071 --> 00:27:47,360
couple of times and she'd been diagnosed
with Lyme disease and has been eating

440
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,420
nothing but like red meat for 18 years.
And there are pictures of her family

441
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,880
online and I thought OK I know I'm not.
I think I Googled allergic to everything

442
00:27:58,191 --> 00:28:03,160
except meat.
So I found her then I found that Shawn

443
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,160
Baker episode you did.
And he'd been doing it for two years and

444
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:12,110
I think that night I thought Screw it.
I literally have nothing to lose here.

445
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,890
I'm only cutting out salad so that's
when I switched over.

446
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:21,370
That was December and then I switched
over and the itching got better pretty

447
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:24,560
quickly like within the first couple of
days.

448
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,550
But then my digestion just got totally
screwed up.

449
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:33,560
So like bloating and diarrhea every time
I eat and after about a week I thought

450
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:38,810
Kay this is a bad idea obviously
diarrhea every time you eat meat just

451
00:28:38,811 --> 00:28:42,680
meat just name and salt roast.
Yeah.

452
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,830
So I thought this is a bad idea.
Obviously this isn't working my body

453
00:28:45,831 --> 00:28:47,930
doesn't like it.
So I reintroduced salad again.

454
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:53,180
It was literally lettuce apple cider
vinegar olive oil and salt and pepper.

455
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,050
That's what I reintroduced.
And I woke up the next day and the itch

456
00:28:57,051 --> 00:29:02,051
was back in my joints were stiff and I
thought OK if I have to choose between

457
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,530
itching and arthritis or diarrhea I'm
going to choose the diarrhea.

458
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,880
I was in a rough place.

459
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Mm hmm yes.
So I stuck it out and at six weeks of

460
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:18,521
just doing this my diet the bloating
went away the diarrhea went away and

461
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:23,531
everything started to improve.
So that was mid-January but I was still

462
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:27,120
pretty skeptical because I thought I
thought maybe the reason the carnivore

463
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:30,900
diet worked for people was because they
just accidentally cut out everything

464
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,960
that wasn't working for them.
Processed foods sugar grains all that.

465
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,290
So I tried to reintroduce all lives like
organic olives and all of oil.

466
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:45,540
That was February and then I had this
itching came back with the depression

467
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,590
and my skin broke out and it was minor
in comparison to like soy.

468
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,820
So you think essentially to give us the
Cliff Notes you're allergic to

469
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:58,821
everything Yeah
that's fucking crazy.

470
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,800
It's crazy.
But then here's the thing.

471
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,440
I started this blog so the blogs don't
eat that.

472
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,030
I started this blog because I thought if
for some reason there's someone else out

473
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:13,110
there like me and they're Googling these
things it'd be nice for them to know

474
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:17,040
that they're not alone right.
And I've found other people like this

475
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,830
who are equally as sensitive I'm sure.

476
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,950
I mean look if you exist there's
probably quite a few people that have

477
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:26,880
that issue.
And since it makes sense that we all

478
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:30,480
have different tolerances and we all
have different allergies some people are

479
00:30:30,481 --> 00:30:32,940
allergic to cats some people have no
problem with peanuts.

480
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,150
Some people eat a brazil nut and they
die just yet.

481
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,183
We know this.

482
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,720
So the idea this is one of the problems
with diet is that people want to think

483
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:45,420
that a diet that works for them works
for everybody and it doesn't work that

484
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:47,520
way.
And thing think people want you to

485
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:51,120
follow their diet no matter what it is
whether it's vegan or paleo.

486
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,100
People are very ideological with that.
They would love you for you to do

487
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:59,160
exactly what they're doing.
So to reinforce what they're doing is

488
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:03,540
correct.
There's a lot of pushback against this

489
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:08,541
carnivore diet idea but I don't I I
don't think it's outside the realm of

490
00:31:10,231 --> 00:31:13,710
possibility that someone like you might
actually really be allergic to

491
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:14,544
everything.

492
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,970
Yeah I mean I was like very sick and
from coming from that place to now I can

493
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:22,650
see how sick I was and it was like I was
dying.

494
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,300
You have a bunch of medication just
trying to do anything with probiotics.

495
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,790
Yeah.
I can't tolerate probiotics you can't

496
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:30,930
tolerate them.
No.

497
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,760
So the original idea was heal my God
repopulate with bacteria that maybe I'm

498
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,530
missing and then maybe incorporate more
foods right.

499
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,460
So what happened when I tried to do the
same autoimmune flare up.

500
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,690
OK but this is the same autumn immune
flare up that you got when you eat

501
00:31:45,691 --> 00:31:46,524
salad.

502
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,350
No not quite not quite as bad not.
It was different.

503
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,340
It was like with salad there's more of
the arthritis.

504
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,330
Mm hmm.
And like body pain and then with

505
00:32:00,331 --> 00:32:04,290
probiotics would you get mood issues.
So like really volatile.

506
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,450
And itchy.
Right.

507
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,580
So I still got the itch.
Yeah.

508
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:13,610
So I think it was I probably had leaky
got into the program just going

509
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:14,190
everywhere.

510
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:18,090
One of things your dad brought up to me
when he was here was the most fires.

511
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,540
Yeah yeah.
And then I started reading up on it

512
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:25,890
after he discussed it with me.
And it's something that I never even

513
00:32:25,891 --> 00:32:26,700
considered before.

514
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,700
But fast rising yeast and all these
different impulsive fires that they put

515
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,250
in bread and wine and various foods.

516
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,690
Mm hmm.
They're terrible for you.

517
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,750
Oh my God yeah.
Terrible for your stomach in there.

518
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,560
They're so prevalent.
They're everywhere.

519
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,020
Yeah.
Soy less often.

520
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,100
Yes.
It's in everything it's in everything.

521
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,610
Yes.

522
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,310
And then I started really paying
attention to it.

523
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,350
I've read several articles on it.
And then a couple of studies.

524
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:54,390
It's it's crazy how this is something
that's never even discussed and it has

525
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:58,800
all sorts of negative effects on your
gut and your gut lining.

526
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,540
It's awful.
Yeah.

527
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,020
Combining that and then it looks like
grains aren't so good for people.

528
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,370
Combining that in grains.
It's no wonder people are ill.

529
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,060
Some people yes.

530
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:15,230
Some people most people though feel look
like obesity or I wouldn't go most I

531
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:19,080
would say some let's say most people are
sedentary.

532
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,830
That's one of the primary Yeah.

533
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,310
But I don't think that's the issue.
I mean.

534
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:28,260
I mean OK.
Say I mean I guess I'm not a great

535
00:33:28,261 --> 00:33:32,010
example but I mean people start gaining
weight if they're lucky when they're

536
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:35,100
middle aged if they're unlucky when
they're around 25 and they start gaining

537
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:36,830
weight.
I don't think it's from lack of exercise

538
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,270
I think it's from diet and I think
diners let's do it.

539
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:44,310
Yeah for sure.
But it's also lack of exercise.

540
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,770
I don't know.
I'm not convinced because people who've

541
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:53,660
gone onto this carnivore diet especially
lose that weight.

542
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,900
But there's a lot of people out there
that are not overweight that don't

543
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,790
follow the carnivore diet so how to
explain that.

544
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,640
Well I'd like to see anybody above the
age of 50 know on a standard standard

545
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,580
American diet award is a standard
American diet.

546
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,770
I mean you might say eating terrible.

547
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,840
No I just mean Standard American Diet.

548
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:16,610
I mean I saw I call it they gave me this
these blanket statements are a real

549
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:17,330
issue.

550
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:22,110
And that's one of the reasons why your
diet is fascinating because like you

551
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,910
know I don't think you can make blanket
statements when it comes to people and

552
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:28,190
diet.
You know that I think there's some

553
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,090
people out there that are damn food
dumpsters.

554
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,850
You could throw anything in there and
they're fine.

555
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,540
They just don't care unseemly issues.
Then closer to that.

556
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,830
Yeah.
My brother is pretty well he's not so

557
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:43,280
good with it like lactose but he's
pretty stable compared to me anyway.

558
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,770
Well you know Michael Phelps the Olympic
swimmer.

559
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,390
Yeah.

560
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,130
It's like 10000 hours a day in several
pizzas.

561
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,450
Yeah I know.

562
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:54,920
I read about him fucking jacked has no
problems at all he's not fat.

563
00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:00,350
It's sad because it but that's an issue
of enormous like expenditure of energy.

564
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,960
I mean he's yeah absolutely exercising
in his body as ridiculous cowardly

565
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,230
calorie requirements.
Yeah caloric.

566
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,720
So yeah I mean it's it's hard to say but
I think sedentary lifestyle is a giant

567
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,470
part of it.
But most of what people do is what we're

568
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:20,480
doing right now.
Most of what people do is sit down.

569
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,720
But is that because they don't feel like
running around because some people like

570
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:27,140
people who exercise.
Generally you have to put in a little

571
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:30,080
bit of effort to make yourself go
exercise but a lot of people who are

572
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:33,890
overweight and sick don't have enough
energy to do that.

573
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:39,590
I don't know about that.
Some of them maybe but I think some of

574
00:35:39,591 --> 00:35:42,500
them just don't have discipline.
There's an issue with that as well.

575
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,680
There's also an issue of momentum.
You're not used to doing it.

576
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,720
It's not a part of your life.
It's not something that you're

577
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:51,260
accustomed to pushing yourself.
There's been many many many many many

578
00:35:51,261 --> 00:35:53,330
many many days where I don't want to
work out.

579
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,540
I just didn't feel like I had the energy
and I just forced myself.

580
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:00,020
And I think there's very few people out
there that know how to force themselves.

581
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,720
That's a learn.
Yeah that's a learned skill.

582
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,090
Yeah.
That that kind of discipline and focus

583
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,250
you have to have like real rigid
requirements of yourself where you don't

584
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:15,140
allow yourself to back out of things and
you don't allow yourself to slack off.

585
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,910
And I don't think people put those kind
of requirements on themselves as if it's

586
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,780
it is a a daily principle of life like
what you must get done.

587
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,090
You know you must brush your teeth and
exercise for 45 minutes.

588
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,560
And if you did that I think you'd be
healthier and happier and your body

589
00:36:33,561 --> 00:36:37,340
would perform more smoothly.
And if you require your body to do

590
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:39,920
things like that I think it rises to the
occasion.

591
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:43,040
There are very few people that have that
kind of discipline.

592
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,870
So because of that they come up with
excuses and excuses are a giant part of

593
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:48,650
the problem.

594
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:53,330
It's not simply a physical health issue.
There's also mental aspects of it.

595
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,390
And discipline is a big one.
I just know way too many people who are

596
00:36:56,391 --> 00:37:01,250
weak mentally and I can't I can't just
chalk it off to only you know their

597
00:37:01,251 --> 00:37:05,390
physical though the way they physically
feel because I felt like shit 100 times

598
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,550
and then I worked out and then I felt
way better.

599
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,030
Yeah it's just it's just a fact of life
that's real.

600
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,940
You know you just get the idea and
people don't know how to do that.

601
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,790
It's all.
And if you're used to doing this get in

602
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:21,791
your car sit down drive to the office
sit down go to the lunch sit down you

603
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:25,910
know go to the board meetings sit down
get in your car and on the way home sit

604
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:30,911
down get home in front of the TV sit
down then go to the gym fuck off do not

605
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:35,150
have any energy you know their bodies
not the debate is like oh don't have it

606
00:37:35,151 --> 00:37:39,860
in me to do this and I don't believe
that I don't believe that I think it's

607
00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:44,861
it's a lot of it is the mindset so I
partly agree with that but because I

608
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:48,770
know I'm like I was a very sick
individual a different case you have

609
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:52,520
real legitimate diagnosed physical
issues.

610
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,600
This is a very different thing.
You have a severe autoimmune disorder.

611
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:00,010
I mean listen you get your hip replaced
you're fucking 17 yeah.

612
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,700
That's crazy.
Yeah.

613
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:05,660
You don't hear that this is different.
I'm talking about the average fat fuck

614
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,200
you just sit around being lazy.
That's really what it is.

615
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:13,190
It's like I'm sure a lot of it is diet
and a lot of that diet affects their

616
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:16,760
physical health but there's been many
many people that have just put their

617
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:21,761
foot down and said enough I'm gonna
change my life and they they don't take

618
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,840
an excuses and they feel way way better
diet is most certainly a part of that

619
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:31,040
but there's also a discipline aspect and
these things are not mutually exclusive.

620
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:35,930
They exist together they're all together
there's and they work symbolically the

621
00:38:35,931 --> 00:38:39,860
way you.
Your mindset affects the choices you

622
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:44,861
make with your diet and the mindset also
affects the choices you make in terms of

623
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:48,890
like whether or not you require yourself
to exercise and I think these are these

624
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:53,630
are critical aspects that people like to
gloss over or they like to make excuses

625
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,530
about and they get very angry if you
don't accept those excuses.

626
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:02,710
And that's a sign that they're trying to
they're trying to enforce this standard

627
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:06,710
in this idea and push it on you and give
themselves an excuse.

628
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,090
It's one of the reasons why they get
angry.

629
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,200
It's one thing if someone has a legit
physical issue like you do but there's a

630
00:39:12,201 --> 00:39:15,020
lot of people who do not.
They just have poor diet choices.

631
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:20,240
They have a sedentary lifestyle and they
have the momentum of this sedentary

632
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:21,590
lifestyle that's holding them back.

633
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,620
They're accustomed to being lazy OK I
kind of kind of agree.

634
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,490
I just from like my perspective I've
seen my dad and he was very like you can

635
00:39:32,491 --> 00:39:35,980
see from the videos from 2014 before he
started going low carb and everything.

636
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,290
He was carrying about 50 extra pounds.
Right.

637
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,570
And he didn't exercise and he didn't
have enough energy to exercise doesn't.

638
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,450
But he didn't look at those lights
right.

639
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,323
That's not true.

640
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,400
He just didn't do it.
No I I don't believe that.

641
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,230
When you say didn't have enough energy
to exercise.

642
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,093
Did he walk around.

643
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,660
Well yeah.

644
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,570
You want to drag yourself through things
and you can drag yourself through an

645
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:56,700
exercise routine.
You can well you must.

646
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,770
You most certainly can.
He most certainly can.

647
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,930
You don't have to do a lot.
You have to do something.

648
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,150
You walk up hills.
You jump a little rope.

649
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,080
You take a little tiny kettlebell you do
a couple cleans impresses you do a few

650
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:09,870
pushups and do a few sit ups.
You get your blood pumping.

651
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,510
You're moving.
You're alive.

652
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,010
You're exercising to say you don't have
enough extra energy to exercise.

653
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,760
That's crazy.
Can you walk to the refrigerator then

654
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:20,370
you can exercise.
I'm not saying that you have to run

655
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:23,520
marathons.
You can exercise and everyone should

656
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,350
fucking exercise.
I agree.

657
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,360
Everyone should exercise.
Don't ever say.

658
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,840
People are so crazy.
They want you to believe I don't have

659
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:34,250
the energy to exercise.
God damn it everyone does if you're a

660
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:36,780
liar.
I cannot say I believe that I've been

661
00:40:36,781 --> 00:40:37,150
there.

662
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,990
I know I'm a different case but I've
seen my dad there and then here's the

663
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:42,600
thing.
Once he fixed up his diet once he went

664
00:40:42,601 --> 00:40:46,620
to this corner of her diet he's
exercising now Choi's got less weight on

665
00:40:46,621 --> 00:40:47,070
his body.

666
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,290
He feels better and he has energy that's
wonderful.

667
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,310
He could have exercise then too.
He would've felt shittier for sure when

668
00:40:53,311 --> 00:40:57,030
it felt as good as you feeling now.
But to give people as excuse I don't

669
00:40:57,031 --> 00:41:01,620
have the energy to exercise that is
crazy to say Can you walk to the fucking

670
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:04,140
refrigerator.
Yes well you can exercise.

671
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,500
You don't have to do anything crazy just
walk around the block.

672
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,920
There's a there's 80 year old ladies who
take yoga with me they're fucking really

673
00:41:13,531 --> 00:41:16,290
old and they're in there they're going
after it.

674
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,890
They could easily say I don't have the
energy to do that but they don't.

675
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,230
It's a mental attitude.
They make a decision.

676
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,070
Yeah I agree.

677
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,820
Like there's a lot of it's discipline
you're gonna get people who just don't

678
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,220
exercise to kill yourself you have to go
to a cross fit class and try to do the

679
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:31,890
work out of the day.
You'd have to go nuts and do clean

680
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:35,040
impresses with 150 pounds.
You'd have to do that but you to do

681
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:39,570
something just get your blood moving
your body has requirements it wants to

682
00:41:39,571 --> 00:41:41,370
move.
It really does and when it does you feel

683
00:41:41,371 --> 00:41:43,290
better.
But people like to give themselves this

684
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:45,390
excuse I do not have the energy to do
this.

685
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,730
Whatever you decide that that's true.
But if you watch a motivational video

686
00:41:50,731 --> 00:41:54,760
this 100 of them on YouTube thousands
even go watch one you'll get fired up

687
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,020
like fuck it I'm going to jump some rope
you jumps from rope you do something

688
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,650
just do some pushups do something do
some bodyweight squats you'll feel

689
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:06,630
better but it's also like learning that
learning that and having that as a part

690
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:11,130
of your daily life it has to be you know
again I'm not talking about someone like

691
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:14,820
you who is in the throes of this
autoimmune disorder where you're getting

692
00:42:14,821 --> 00:42:18,330
your hip replaced at 17 I'm not talking
about someone with like serious

693
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:22,140
degenerative illness I'm talking about
just a regular person who's overweight

694
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,333
you can do it.

695
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,990
There's a lady who's like 450 pounds it
takes yoga with me she's enormous she's

696
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:30,780
in there was probably really
embarrassing.

697
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,700
Very hard to do.
Yeah you know and she's in there did

698
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,220
you.
We could.

699
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,480
Anyone could do it.
We can do it.

700
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,000
And again I'm not saying do what Michael
Phelps does.

701
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,920
I'm just saying just do something.

702
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,153
Got to do something.

703
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,320
We have fucked up lifestyles.
Yeah.

704
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,230
The lifestyle.
Yeah.

705
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,070
We'll have are just the human body is
not designed to sit down all day and

706
00:42:50,071 --> 00:42:54,360
it's certainly not designed to be stuck
in traffic and be in an office and just

707
00:42:54,361 --> 00:42:58,410
be you know fluorescent lights sitting
there in front of a fucking computer

708
00:42:58,411 --> 00:43:02,670
monitor watching your soul get sucked
through the the LCD screen.

709
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,833
It's crazy.

710
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah yeah I agree.

711
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,680
I think we've got to be really careful
with just the way we describe things.

712
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:14,100
It's like say I don't have the energy to
do something to fuck off.

713
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,143
Stop.

714
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,680
I don't know.
I believe it still.

715
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,770
That was good.
But I'm still not convinced.

716
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,880
You still know I think.
Well I think you change your diet and

717
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:24,840
then you can exercise.

718
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,640
You can exercise without changing your
diet.

719
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,600
There's a lot of people do.

720
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,950
They do yeah.
But I'm not as partly that's discipline.

721
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:37,190
Yes but partly that's being able to I'm
still I don't know you haven't.

722
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,350
So what do you think is holding them
back.

723
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,990
Well I think if you're carrying around
extra weight like a quite a bit of extra

724
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:49,800
weight and you say I don't have enough
energy there's something serious going

725
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:52,710
on that isn't just oh I have a few extra
pounds.

726
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,850
I don't think we know exactly what that
looks like but a lot of that has to do

727
00:43:56,851 --> 00:43:59,730
with energy.
I mean dad was sleeping here sleeping

728
00:43:59,731 --> 00:44:03,330
for two hours a day in the middle of the
day and he was impossible to wake up.

729
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:07,120
He couldn't wake up and like shake them
and couldn't wake him up.

730
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:12,140
Dad told me he was on a standard diet of
legs sandwiches and pasta things on

731
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,050
hands.
Yeah have that big insulin dump.

732
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,283
Yeah.

733
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,410
Yeah but I mean most people who don't
have enough energy are in a lot of those

734
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:24,720
people don't realize like we were eating
whole grains.

735
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,510
We didn't know that whole grains were
just grains.

736
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:32,340
We had the whole grains were healthy.
So I was having sandwiches for lunch

737
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,300
because I was having cheese and bread
and that was protein.

738
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,040
Right your dad has autoimmune disease
disorders as well.

739
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:39,770
Yeah.
A significant right.

740
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:44,370
Crucial to the depression was at 17 if
that was the main one that was very

741
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:45,000
significant.

742
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,180
Yeah I think you know it's hard to do.

743
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,680
It's hard to also figure out like what
is depression.

744
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,580
We say no sign of depression to the
person doesn't have depression like

745
00:44:55,581 --> 00:44:57,730
myself.
I hear that and I go OK.

746
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,100
What does that mean.
Yeah it does it.

747
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,310
Mean you feel bad.
What does it mean does it mean there's

748
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:04,280
like a thick wet blanket over your life
that you can't get out.

749
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,310
Yeah it means like there's a couple of
things.

750
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:13,640
The closest it's it's impossible to
think of when you're not depressed but

751
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:18,020
the closest I've get to is if you're in
a really really stressful situation and

752
00:45:18,021 --> 00:45:21,710
a whole bunch of things go wrong at the
same time that's stress you feel is kind

753
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:24,680
of like a really really mild version of
being depressed.

754
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,160
Being depressed is like if you look at
something the colors seem muted you

755
00:45:31,461 --> 00:45:36,461
don't get joy out of anything.
This color the sky reds like just colors

756
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:41,990
everything's in gray scale kind of feels
like you're walking through molasses and

757
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:45,860
then you have a whole bunch of anxieties
pop up all the time that are like worst

758
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:50,861
case scenarios of everything in your
entire life that won't happen but that's

759
00:45:51,561 --> 00:45:56,561
all you can think of all the time that
things partly anxiety but it's hell like

760
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:01,100
I having arthritis I would choose
arthritis a million times over then this

761
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,110
depression just wrecks you.

762
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:09,240
So what leads you to the carnivore died.
This lady has been living on it for 18

763
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:12,330
years.
You read about her and that she's still

764
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:16,350
alive without eating and her Lyme
disease gone and she looks great.

765
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,740
There's a before and after picture.

766
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:21,780
She loves taking vitamins as well.
Nothing nothing beef and salt.

767
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,240
Right.
So this is what you hear so this

768
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,360
anecdotal story is what leads you to
give that a try.

769
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,580
Well.
Yeah this is 2017 so December must.

770
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,690
Yeah.
So not quite a year.

771
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:38,910
So I switched over and then I had these
transient transition symptoms diarrhea.

772
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,430
Yeah.
That was basically it was craving.

773
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,330
It's bold to hang in there with six
weeks diarrhea.

774
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,790
Yeah but the alternative was like
anxiety and itching and arthritis.

775
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,660
Well you were also probably at the end
of your rope right where you're like Oh

776
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:53,310
yeah.
Like I said I can't even eat miso soup

777
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:54,960
right.

778
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,580
There's nothing else like I don't care
about salad.

779
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,280
I've already given up everything I love.
Take it away.

780
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:04,590
And then after six weeks it got better.
And then I reintroduced all of not went

781
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:06,900
badly and I thought OK I'm done with the
reintroduction.

782
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:08,070
I'm just sticking with meat.

783
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:12,680
Your dad said he's going to try to
reintroduce mushrooms Yeah.

784
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:17,050
We'll see how that goes.
He seems to be weirdly sensitive to like

785
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:20,770
in the same category as me.
But instead of getting arthritis and all

786
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:24,190
these other things as well he just gets
the depression which is the worst one.

787
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:24,640
Well

788
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,690
he said he he introduced something to
his diet and he didn't sleep for like 24

789
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:29,290
days.

790
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,180
Yeah.
So it's not even possible.

791
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,230
Wow.
Dead.

792
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:35,080
No.
That's what it felt like I had the same

793
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,570
weight I had the same thing.
We ate the same thing.

794
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,260
I think it was sulfates in apple cider
in a stew I made.

795
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,650
I don't know what it was.
I think that's what it was.

796
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,580
And yeah.
And then there was the edging came back

797
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:52,320
and the doom came in.
This depression came in and then.

798
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,570
That's that's weird and it hasn't
happened very many times.

799
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,260
But I got stuck with insomnia and it
felt like we weren't sleep.

800
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,000
So you slept like a little bit and you
wake up.

801
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,610
Probably yeah.
It does not what it felt like but I'm

802
00:48:03,611 --> 00:48:06,550
sure you know it's not physically
possible to stay awake for that long but

803
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:07,840
I don't feel like sleeping.

804
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,030
What's the world record that someone's
ever stayed awake.

805
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,180
I think it's only like 10 days.
Yeah I think it's 11:00 10:00 or 11:00.

806
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,880
Yeah something along those lines.

807
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,800
God why would he do that.
Was it just a task version.

808
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,610
Eleven days and twenty five minutes.

809
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:25,540
Twenty five minutes.
That's what it takes with that dude with

810
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,440
Down a half deep.

811
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,920
Wow that's crazy.
So I must unless you dad stomp the shit

812
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:36,730
out of that world record.

813
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,810
No I'm sure he was sleeping but it was
like it was you know it didn't feel like

814
00:48:40,811 --> 00:48:42,280
that and it wasn't very much.

815
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:46,390
It's just crazy that one thing.
What do you remember what it was that he

816
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:49,320
reintroduced to his dance that that was
might have been.

817
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,930
It wasn't a reintroduction it was.
We were just still eating apples at that

818
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:56,200
point and it was a cider and it had salt
fights at it and I looked at it and

819
00:48:56,201 --> 00:49:00,250
thought whatever it's like parts per
million sulphide it'll be fine

820
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,050
and then that was the only thing that
was new.

821
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:08,820
So do you think that as you get onto
this elimination diet and you start

822
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:11,340
taking things out you get what you get.
Yeah.

823
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,400
You get more sensitive cards like one of
things that that I noticed in a big way

824
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:20,670
was when I cut sugar out of my diet.
If I have sugar now like if I go crazy

825
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:24,740
and have an ice cream sundae I hit a
fuckin wall so hard where I can't even

826
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:27,420
get up.
To sit down the cast my oh it takes like

827
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,060
an hour or two for it to get out of my
system.

828
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:34,260
So for like an hour.
And I'm like oh God I feel like shit.

829
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,930
And then two hours later I go OK it's
done.

830
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,670
That's it.
It's two hours.

831
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,550
Yeah about two hours.
It's like 24 days for me.

832
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,930
Yeah.
Oh I believe you.

833
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:46,290
I believe you.
But for me it's just for two hours.

834
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,830
I mean and again it's not I'm not
depressed for two hours.

835
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,200
I just feel like I have a brick in my
stomach.

836
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:55,140
Yeah.
And I feel like I'm on a tranquilizer.

837
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,850
Yeah yeah yeah.
So most of the that's how I lived all my

838
00:49:59,851 --> 00:50:01,860
life.
No it's good tranquilizer like it's

839
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:05,310
idiopathic hyper Sonia was like I was
falling asleep during exams.

840
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,720
I drove home on the highway one time
when I was 22 and I was falling asleep

841
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:13,320
at the wheel and I was like Oh my God.
Like I can't stay awake passing out.

842
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:18,150
And I moved over into a lane and a truck
came by and honked at me and I was like

843
00:50:18,151 --> 00:50:23,151
home my God I'm going to die.
And then I went on Adderall Whoa like I

844
00:50:23,611 --> 00:50:28,040
need to stay awake or I'm going to die.
RFE RL Oh yeah yeah.

845
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,200
I'm off of everything and the Adderall
so I stopped taking the

846
00:50:31,201 --> 00:50:35,820
immunosuppressants when I cut out gluten
just to see how my arthritic flare ups

847
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:40,850
would go if anything would happen then I
was then I got off the antidepressants

848
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,520
November 2015 and then my fatigue lifted
in January 2016.

849
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,750
So I got off the Adderall right away
then mm mm hmm.

850
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:56,640
I was taking a lot and it was great when
I was in that like feeling like I was on

851
00:50:56,641 --> 00:50:59,670
tranquilizers It was great.
But once you don't need it it's kind of

852
00:50:59,671 --> 00:51:01,980
awful being on that amount of
amphetamine all the time.

853
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:07,230
I know so many people are on that.
It's so disturbing to me how many people

854
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:11,880
are taking that and talk about their
productivity and they're always it makes

855
00:51:11,881 --> 00:51:13,620
you feel like you're being productive.

856
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,910
I don't know if it actually makes you
more productive and it just destroys

857
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:20,550
your short term memory does it destroyed
mine.

858
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:25,440
I was taking a lot those on 40
milligrams a day on the morning long

859
00:51:25,441 --> 00:51:28,800
release this one of those things I've
always thought about trying I'm like

860
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:34,370
maybe one day if you have energy if you
have energy I don't think he gives you a

861
00:51:35,461 --> 00:51:38,370
kick.
Like if you're exhausted all the time

862
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,030
it's just kind of unpleasant and it
makes you like weirdly anti-social.

863
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:44,323
Mm hmm.

864
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,960
OK so you haven't been on this died for
a year now.

865
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:51,900
What has changed once you got over the
diarrhea.

866
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:54,580
What has the change been like.

867
00:51:55,570 --> 00:52:00,160
So the arthritis and like the auto
immune stuff went away fairly quickly

868
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,740
when I was still having diarrhea and I
went away.

869
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:08,100
The mood started to pick up six weeks
into the diet and then in May so I'd

870
00:52:08,681 --> 00:52:09,830
been December driver.

871
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:13,750
March April May.
So five months into it I had a huge

872
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,450
improvement.
So things just got better and better

873
00:52:16,451 --> 00:52:19,600
everyday and I finally got to the point
where I was pre pregnancy.

874
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:25,100
So since May
as I would say it's still getting

875
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:27,060
better.
So it's only been three months.

876
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,640
So you've been OK.
No I've been OK since January but my

877
00:52:31,641 --> 00:52:35,370
mood went from like eight to like a nine
and a half.

878
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:37,640
Like great.
In May.

879
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,510
So it's feeling good after I started
after this first six weeks.

880
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:47,770
But then things got a lot better and may
seem to be just improving now.

881
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,630
What kind of bloodwork are you getting
while you're doing all this.

882
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:55,070
Are you going and getting tested for
nutritional deficiencies.

883
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:00,120
Because one of the issues that many
people who are nutritionists or who are

884
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:05,711
studying biology have with this
carnivore diet is that meat just meat is

885
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,350
very deficient in many many nutrients.

886
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:14,530
It's just it's very deficient in vitamin
C is deficient in several things that we

887
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:18,110
think that you need in order to to live.

888
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,640
Yeah well I did get bloodwork done
because people were asking and not

889
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:26,360
because I particularly trust bloodwork
because my bloodwork was always pretty

890
00:53:26,361 --> 00:53:28,510
normal.
I was always low in zinc and vitamin D

891
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,330
since I was a kid.

892
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,130
Even when you had severe arthritis.

893
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:32,670
Yeah.
Everything was normal.

894
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:36,110
I had no blood markers and I was like
dying but Jesus.

895
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,970
What about for inflammation my white
blood cell count was high.

896
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,710
Give me a sign of infection.
Right.

897
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:45,740
So that was high my vitamin D and my
zinc were low.

898
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,180
Right.
But that's not what showed up.

899
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:49,970
But that wouldn't be normal right.
If you went and you got your blood

900
00:53:49,971 --> 00:53:52,550
tested and they showed you you have a
high white blood cell count that would

901
00:53:52,551 --> 00:53:53,660
go there's an issue here.

902
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:58,370
Yes.
It wasn't abnormal enough to have caused

903
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:03,410
the problems I was experiencing.
But how about how how different was it

904
00:54:03,411 --> 00:54:08,411
from the normal white blood cell count.
Well I had white bloods raised white

905
00:54:08,961 --> 00:54:11,870
blood cell count and I had white blood
cells in my urine.

906
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:17,300
And that's that's a little weird because
that is generally like while some sort

907
00:54:17,301 --> 00:54:20,240
of bacterial infection which I didn't
have symptoms of.

908
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,660
Mm hmm.
So that was a little weird but that was

909
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:25,850
never focused on from the doctors.
Why not.

910
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:28,130
Well that seems like that's that's an
issue.

911
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,760
If normal people don't have that and you
have problems that normal people don't

912
00:54:31,761 --> 00:54:34,460
have.
I would say my blood work is not.

913
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,070
I mean your blood work is not normal.
That's not normal.

914
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:40,940
No but I mean I was on all the
medications they could put me on.

915
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:45,470
So there wasn't and they never looked at
diet so I was kind of at a standstill.

916
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:48,290
Well but you when you said that you
don't trust blood work and then.

917
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:51,230
Well I did get it done right.
Mostly for the blog so that everybody

918
00:54:51,231 --> 00:54:53,650
could see I wasn't dying.
I can pull it up.

919
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,870
OK.
That was one of the issues with Shaun

920
00:54:56,871 --> 00:54:59,300
Baker.
Shawn got his blood work done and one of

921
00:54:59,301 --> 00:55:02,270
the things that people noticed is that
there's quite a few issues there.

922
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:06,110
And one of them was very very low
testosterone which is crazy because he's

923
00:55:06,111 --> 00:55:10,010
a gorilla.
Yeah he's a big huge 6 foot 5 250 pound

924
00:55:10,011 --> 00:55:11,930
dude.
So it's like well he didn't look

925
00:55:11,931 --> 00:55:14,390
deficient in testosterone like what the
hell is going on here.

926
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,940
Yeah I don't have testosterone readings.

927
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:20,780
He also said that part of that might you
know he I have gone back and forth about

928
00:55:20,781 --> 00:55:21,920
this.
He said part of that might have been

929
00:55:21,921 --> 00:55:26,921
that had to do with taking the test when
he had done a very heavy weight lifting

930
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:31,760
workout the day before.
If he'd done squats and deadlifts and

931
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:34,310
all kinds of stuff and so maybe broke
his body down a bit.

932
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,540
Yeah.
Kind of makes sense.

933
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:38,750
I'll be nice first.
Like a medical professional to take some

934
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:41,840
of these groups of people doing this
diet and just do a study.

935
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,280
Mm hmm.
So we could actually get some

936
00:55:43,281 --> 00:55:44,390
information.
Yeah.

937
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,590
Instead of like everything's anecdotal
and I put my stuff up but just because

938
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:52,490
so I can show it to you but everything
is normal.

939
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,900
Everything is normal.
My Farrington is slightly slightly

940
00:55:56,901 --> 00:56:01,080
elevated but like fair it's an iron.
OK.

941
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:05,290
So that's slightly elevated because
you're eating a little lightly red meat

942
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,480
but that's not bad.
Not necessarily.

943
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,140
And it was still like my doctor said he
didn't care it wasn't elevated enough

944
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:17,470
but like what about vitamins.
So for vitamins

945
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,680
vitamins my zinc is still low.
My Vitamin D still low that hasn't

946
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,570
recovered.
It's been like that and it's been like

947
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,840
out forever.
Well it's hard in Canada like I have

948
00:56:30,841 --> 00:56:34,560
some pictures on Instagram and I'm Green
because there's no light for like six

949
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:39,561
months
and then I'm outside all summer so I'm

950
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:45,330
probably deficient.
I think that has something to do with

951
00:56:45,331 --> 00:56:48,180
the auto immune disorder.
I tried supplementing with really high

952
00:56:48,181 --> 00:56:50,100
dose vitamin D and didn't see any
benefits.

953
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,190
So I hope I don't take supplements
anymore.

954
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,280
The high dose vitamin D.
Yeah.

955
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:01,840
I tried once when I was 21 for about a
year and then again when I was doing on

956
00:57:02,091 --> 00:57:03,140
the low carb diet.

957
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:07,010
Well what about now when you're issues
with vitamin D or in your blood.

958
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,940
Just got my bloodwork back.
Okay so I was doing no no supplements so

959
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:12,170
that I could see what happened.

960
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,530
Also I wouldn't recommend high dose of
vitamin D.

961
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:19,940
Oh just recommend supplementing with a
normal dose of vitamin D.

962
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,950
I think I'm just going to wait and see
and get tested in a year.

963
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:29,090
I'm not too concerned and see what
happens because here's here's what's

964
00:57:29,091 --> 00:57:32,060
interesting.
When I went to the low carb diet my B

965
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:34,490
vitamins were low.
So this was during the pregnancy I got

966
00:57:34,491 --> 00:57:39,260
this first test and it was my b twelve
was fine but everything else was low

967
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:44,290
folate was low B one B three B six and
Biogen were all low on the low carb

968
00:57:45,561 --> 00:57:48,770
diet.
Right on my natural path said maybe you

969
00:57:48,771 --> 00:57:53,270
have a microbiome problem whatever that
means whenever someone says my natural

970
00:57:53,271 --> 00:57:56,120
process they just go Oh yeah.

971
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:58,220
What else.
I was like need a costume like that.

972
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,100
Yeah.
Crystal with you at all times.

973
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,380
You know what they were they're telling
me to cut out gluten for years and I was

974
00:58:06,381 --> 00:58:09,140
like What do you know.
Right crazy person.

975
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:13,370
Yeah I could have probably stopped you
need to stop some pressure on your wall

976
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,920
put a Jewish culture above your bed.
That'll help.

977
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,260
Mm hmm.
Anyway this new micro nutrients test the

978
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:26,500
vitamin D and count not calcium vitamin
D and zinc are still low but all my bees

979
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:35,620
have gone up so none of my bees folate
is still borderline but it was deficient

980
00:58:36,661 --> 00:58:39,930
before and all my other bees are have
gone up to normal.

981
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:43,830
What about Vitamin C O vitamin C was
always normal Vitamin C hasn't changed

982
00:58:43,831 --> 00:58:44,280
at all.

983
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,270
That's fascinating because that's one of
the ones I think people are deficient if

984
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:49,650
you are on this diet.

985
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:55,020
Well I did some background reading
because I've been I thought people died

986
00:58:55,021 --> 00:58:58,380
of scurvy if they didn't eat vegetables
just like everybody thinks that well.

987
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:01,950
But it turns out vitamin C and glucose
compete.

988
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:07,380
So if you don't eat glucose you just
don't use as much vitamin C..

989
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:11,300
Mm hmm.
Yeah and I haven't been supplementing my

990
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:12,510
vitamin C is totally fine.

991
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,250
Yeah.
Sean Baker said something about

992
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:18,260
something along those lines.
That was some of the vitamin C that

993
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:23,500
you're taking in is competing with
glucose and that you need far less of it

994
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:28,310
and it's far more effective.
So there is some vitamin C in beef.

995
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,300
Yeah.
Are you telling the grass fed beef or

996
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:33,020
you do care.

997
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,960
So initially I tried to get rid of all
the variables because I didn't know what

998
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:39,080
I was reacting to.
So I was eating grass fed antibiotic

999
00:59:39,081 --> 00:59:42,350
free.
All that stuff and now I'm eating mostly

1000
00:59:42,351 --> 00:59:45,530
I try to stay away from the antibiotic
and hormone meat but I'm eating grain

1001
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:49,340
finished because it's just so much
cheaper than grass fed and it doesn't.

1002
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,630
I have no problems with it.

1003
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,070
How would you know whether or not beef
has antibiotics or hormones in it you

1004
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:57,360
just trust the labeling right.

1005
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,590
That's it but I.
But I've gone out to eat in restaurants

1006
01:00:00,591 --> 01:00:04,220
where I'm sure the meats lower quality
and I haven't had an autoimmune flare up

1007
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:05,054
with that.
Mm.

1008
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:08,750
Hmm.
So when you go out to eat you know one

1009
01:00:08,751 --> 01:00:12,170
of things you posted the other day was
that you had steak that had pepper on

1010
01:00:12,171 --> 01:00:12,470
it.

1011
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:16,460
Yeah I had pepper on Monday pepper like
ground pepper and you're freaking out.

1012
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,550
I was freaking out on Monday.
Yeah that was like I don't know what

1013
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:21,930
happens.
It's OK.

1014
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:24,980
I'm fine.
But yeah I was freaking out I was

1015
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:28,670
stressed out for the whole day.
But it's like if it flared first of all

1016
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:31,940
these flare ups don't happen instantly.
So it gives you enough time to freak out

1017
01:00:31,941 --> 01:00:33,950
about if they're going to happen for a
couple of days.

1018
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:36,320
Right.
And then it's like a month of an

1019
01:00:36,321 --> 01:00:41,321
autoimmune disorder and depression and
brain fog and not being able to think is

1020
01:00:41,331 --> 01:00:43,850
horrible.
So yeah I am freaked out but I'm OK.

1021
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,140
The one thing I found really helps.
The only thing I found that helps these

1022
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:49,910
reactions is an infrared sauna.

1023
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,410
If I get in there like once a day and
sweat only an infrared one what about a

1024
01:00:54,411 --> 01:00:56,900
regular one.
Do you know.

1025
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,790
Honestly no I don't know.
You don't know.

1026
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:02,930
So the idea just elevated heat
temperature whether it's infrared or

1027
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:03,764
not.

1028
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,140
Yeah I don't know if it's.
I've just read all the benefits of

1029
01:01:06,141 --> 01:01:09,080
infrared but I haven't any fits over a
regular sauna.

1030
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,740
Wow.
There's like longevity studies from

1031
01:01:12,741 --> 01:01:13,550
Finland.

1032
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:15,980
Those are done in the regular sauna.
That's a regular sauna.

1033
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,410
Yeah.
The ones that are done that show the

1034
01:01:18,411 --> 01:01:22,280
decrease of mortality of 40 percent.
It's a regular sauna regular sauna.

1035
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:25,780
Yeah.
But mitochondrial helps you go that.

1036
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:31,190
Please there's a study maybe Rhonda
Patrick has it up on our Web site but

1037
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:35,150
because I asked her whether I should get
a regular sauna or a infrared and she

1038
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:37,400
said the studies that were done were
done with a regular sauna.

1039
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:41,900
And she said the real issue is that your
body is producing heat shock proteins.

1040
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,960
So whether it's infrared or regular the
whole.

1041
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:48,260
The real issue is your body's in this
extreme 170 degree temperature produces

1042
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:53,261
these cytokines and these cytokines
cytokines taglines and your body is

1043
01:01:54,201 --> 01:01:58,120
reacting to this incredible temperature
and this is what produces anti

1044
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:00,980
inflammation effect.
I would think for someone like you with

1045
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:05,450
arthritis in particular anything that
reduces inflammation would be a great

1046
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:05,960
benefit.

1047
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,430
So yeah.
No it's sorry.

1048
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,860
Awesome.
I just if I'm reacting like Sonia makes

1049
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:13,220
me feel like 20 percent better.
Like a lot better.

1050
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,380
Laughter I get out.
Yeah.

1051
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:19,540
If I'm not reacting I don't sweat as
much when I get in and it's nice but

1052
01:02:19,821 --> 01:02:22,460
it's not like a huge relief like it is
when I'm reacting.

1053
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:25,070
It's giant for me.
I mean I don't have the autoimmune

1054
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:29,000
issues that you have but boy for me it's
just it's a game changer.

1055
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:31,280
Yeah.
Get in there for 20 minutes half hour

1056
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:33,440
and I get out there it's just like
everything just feels better.

1057
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,333
Yeah yeah.

1058
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:38,510
And it hits me like about 20 minutes
after I get out and I get this mood up

1059
01:02:38,511 --> 01:02:41,390
and it's just like once your body I
think that what that is is your

1060
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:45,950
temperature normalizes your body
temperature normalizes after you're out

1061
01:02:45,951 --> 01:02:48,770
of that heat and then everything's just
like Oh yeah.

1062
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,570
No it's great.
It's great.

1063
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,520
Have you done the crime therapy.
Yeah.

1064
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,600
Similar feeling right.

1065
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:56,030
Yeah.
Not as good I don't think.

1066
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:00,500
No but similar feeling it's better
actually for pain so I have my ankle

1067
01:03:00,501 --> 01:03:05,120
replacement still gives me problems
because it's an ankle replacement so

1068
01:03:05,121 --> 01:03:09,380
I've done trial therapy for that and
that's works better for pain I think

1069
01:03:09,381 --> 01:03:10,280
than the sauna does.

1070
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:12,470
Now what do they do when they replace
your ankle.

1071
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:16,910
Do they cut off the bottom of the joint
and recap it and put something else

1072
01:03:16,911 --> 01:03:17,270
there.

1073
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:22,270
So they cut off yeah.
They cut off the bottom of the tibia

1074
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:27,290
it's a big bone tibia and then they
replace the top of the Tallis.

1075
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:33,670
It sucks and I got it done in 2009 when
the ankle joints weren't as good as they

1076
01:03:35,751 --> 01:03:38,840
are now.
So now I'm left with this like old ankle

1077
01:03:38,841 --> 01:03:43,841
joint and I'm 26 so I have to get it
looked at because it's giving me

1078
01:03:44,691 --> 01:03:45,524
problems.

1079
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,260
You going to get another one.
Oh God no I hope not.

1080
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:51,400
I think they're just gonna try and fix I
had it some super dope carbon fiber a

1081
01:03:51,401 --> 01:03:54,200
new model.
I know they don't have that.

1082
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:57,460
Nobody's like making anything cool.
No no.

1083
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:02,240
It seems like they're constantly
improving that I mean it looks like on

1084
01:04:02,241 --> 01:04:05,210
YouTube but that's not really what it
looks like in real life.

1085
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,160
No.
Now it's like maybe I could just get a

1086
01:04:07,161 --> 01:04:10,790
new foot I could get a better foot right
on a new foot to a new foot.

1087
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:15,680
Well some robot foot maybe salon.
Like what the fuck is this.

1088
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:18,870
Depends on the robot foot.

1089
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:22,580
You'd be down for a robot foot if it
like took away all your pain.

1090
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:23,503
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1091
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:26,000
If I could run again I can't run with an
ankle replacement.

1092
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,290
What about you.
Hip replacement can I have replacements

1093
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:30,800
resign.
Yeah but they I have friends that got a

1094
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:32,900
hip replacement they said of running out
of the question.

1095
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:35,570
So I love the idea.
Like you said no way.

1096
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,433
You can't run.

1097
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:39,800
I could run on the hip replacement
really and I can limp along with my

1098
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:42,980
ankle but the hip replacement gives me
no problems.

1099
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:47,720
It's great but I thought that the load
that is placed on the hip is not.

1100
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:52,740
I don't think they recommend activities
like that all the time all the time.

1101
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:57,270
But even like a watch an elliptical
that's pretty low impact.

1102
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:01,250
And I can't do that because of my ankle
but my hip is fine.

1103
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,310
Have you ever tried to verse a climber.
No.

1104
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:09,670
We have to know that.
So when angled like a beam like with

1105
01:05:10,461 --> 01:05:15,461
handles on it and you do this
phenomenal cardio it's amazing.

1106
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,910
Works your core because you're at an
angle so you got you're kind of planking

1107
01:05:19,911 --> 01:05:21,350
almost a little bit while you're doing
it.

1108
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,420
Oh wow.
Yeah.

1109
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,410
My or sadder.
Yeah.

1110
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:28,380
Do you do sprints with it and then do
two bodies like 2010s.

1111
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:32,750
Wow 20 seconds on 10 second break 20
seconds on ten second break.

1112
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,790
Phenomenal huh.
Yeah.

1113
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:38,340
One of the best exercises in terms of
cardio huh.

1114
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,940
I stopped.
So did you do a bike.

1115
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:44,690
No I can't really do anything with his
ankle but I did start it.

1116
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,750
Yeah it's a huge pain.
I'm gonna need to get surgery I think

1117
01:05:47,751 --> 01:05:50,660
I'm getting something done in January.
And what are they gonna do.

1118
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:56,140
So basically bone has grown into the
joint so it's basically fused.

1119
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:02,480
So I just don't have any movement and it
kind of hurts and it doesn't hurt like

1120
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:07,380
it hurt when I needed it replaced but it
hurts so they're going to go in and

1121
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:09,810
clean out all the bone and pray that
that works.

1122
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:14,220
Jesus.
So that's that's what my January is

1123
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:14,760
gonna be.

1124
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,600
Does this make you think that like if
you got on this die.

1125
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,410
Yeah.
When you were younger you could have

1126
01:06:19,411 --> 01:06:22,560
ordered all the shots is why I'm not
very pleased with the medical community.

1127
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:23,910
What the hell do they know me.

1128
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,560
They didn't know back but they could
have said I don't know.

1129
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,910
They could've look to the celiac thing
and I would have at least been clued in

1130
01:06:29,911 --> 01:06:32,850
that gluten was a problem and maybe just
removing that would've been good enough.

1131
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:37,350
Well it seems that the amount of
research that they would have to do.

1132
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,050
I mean think about how many different
things you have to look out to come to

1133
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,840
that illusion the time you had to spend
like three years.

1134
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:45,350
Yeah.
And Canada has public.

1135
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,880
I mean you have public health care
right.

1136
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:52,500
So it's it's it's weird right.
Not as motivated.

1137
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:57,790
They're not it's not ideal for people
with very special problems.

1138
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,650
Right.

1139
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:02,670
Good for general public and it's great
if you don't have money and you need to

1140
01:07:02,671 --> 01:07:05,970
get taken care of but they have a lot of
people coming in and out.

1141
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,990
Right.
It's constant.

1142
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:09,180
I'm getting this surgery done in North
Carolina.

1143
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:12,810
Wow.
Just fuckin turn your back on Canada

1144
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:13,873
huh.

1145
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:18,480
I could wait around for like three and a
half years for a surgeon that's not as

1146
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:18,910
good.

1147
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:20,640
Yeah yeah.

1148
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:24,760
That this infrared thing I'm finding
very interesting stuff.

1149
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:29,840
I remember reading what you said but I'm
not finding that and I've only found

1150
01:07:29,881 --> 01:07:33,300
stuff that I can't find.
Ben Greenfield I think it was a

1151
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:35,270
transcription of a podcast today with
Rhonda.

1152
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,410
Mm hmm.
And something else very similar which is

1153
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,690
information from Dr. Jill Kahn.
Mm hmm.

1154
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:45,120
That says only sunlight sunlight and far
infrared sonnets have been shown to

1155
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:49,920
increase core temperature for effective
detoxification because they get you can

1156
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:55,050
stay longer in the threshold area they
want to around one hundred and thirty

1157
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:57,930
degrees you can be there up to forty
five minutes or so.

1158
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:00,660
Mm hmm.
And you I guess you can't unless you can

1159
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:04,800
withstand it in a trailer heat one
because it's heating the air around you

1160
01:08:04,801 --> 01:08:06,510
not light heating your body.

1161
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,090
Oh interesting.
Yeah.

1162
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:13,550
So the infrared one is heating your body
in specific rather than you being in the

1163
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:15,270
heat.
Correct.

1164
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:19,620
Interesting.
So you can do it longer and that's where

1165
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,310
the benefits.
What how much longer.

1166
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,850
How long you supposed to it said at
least 30 minutes.

1167
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:26,340
But that's what I do anyway.
I don't know the difference.

1168
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:28,290
So infrared song is good if you're a
pussy.

1169
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:31,500
So that's why I didn't want to say that.
But hey maybe that's what they're saying

1170
01:08:31,501 --> 01:08:35,400
I don't know.
Well it seems like you get more benefit

1171
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:39,880
with less suffering that's what it would
seem like because you could do it

1172
01:08:39,881 --> 01:08:40,450
longer.

1173
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:43,180
I think that's what they're getting at
but I don't know if that's the reason

1174
01:08:43,181 --> 01:08:46,150
why I got enough people off to just quit
after 20 minutes and I can't get to the

1175
01:08:46,151 --> 01:08:46,630
30.

1176
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:49,840
Well people do man they get does get
uncomfortable with it but if you could

1177
01:08:49,841 --> 01:08:53,140
have if you get the same benefits you
could avoid the discomfort why wouldn't

1178
01:08:53,141 --> 01:08:53,974
you do that right.

1179
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:56,110
Mm hmm.
It also just it's just uncomfortable

1180
01:08:56,111 --> 01:08:58,810
right before you start sweating when
you're like oh I'm really hot and then

1181
01:08:58,811 --> 01:09:00,430
you start sweating and you're it's not
as bad.

1182
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:05,320
There's a new company that's making an
infrared sauna that you work out in.

1183
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:10,650
It's got a chin up bar in and it's got
all these like like resistance cables.

1184
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:15,280
The other part of this too which is I'd
have to go more into science is that I

1185
01:09:15,281 --> 01:09:19,060
don't know is that the LCD is like the
infrared light can penetrate your skin

1186
01:09:19,061 --> 01:09:22,270
whereas the heat maybe can't because
it's just heat.

1187
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:26,860
It's heating up your skin.
It's not like infrared is literally a

1188
01:09:26,861 --> 01:09:27,970
wave.
It's a lightweight.

1189
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,030
It's a different kind of it invigorates
your mitochondria so many works and that

1190
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:32,290
love.

1191
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:36,250
The studies that they did in was in
Norway Finland Finland.

1192
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,650
Maybe they just didn't have infrared
there.

1193
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:43,180
Maybe I maybe I don't know because like
those Russian Banias they do the regular

1194
01:09:43,181 --> 01:09:47,080
saw on us these regular saw on us and
they go hot cold hot cold and they've

1195
01:09:47,081 --> 01:09:50,340
had some pretty awesome benefits of
that.

1196
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:53,500
And so there might be something to that
because they're using light like

1197
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:55,840
dentists using light now to harden
fillings.

1198
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,520
So that's pretty new.
Yeah science.

1199
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:03,490
She Blinded Me With Science.
Fascinating stuff.

1200
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:08,050
It is all very fascinating stuff.
But so sauna definitely helps you either

1201
01:10:08,051 --> 01:10:08,480
way.

1202
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,320
Yeah yeah.
And I think like I've read some studies

1203
01:10:11,321 --> 01:10:15,130
on it working out a mitochondrial level.
I don't know anything about it.

1204
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:19,240
I'm just there's something to it and it
after about half an hour is the only

1205
01:10:19,241 --> 01:10:23,380
thing that's helped.
I've tried like I tried everything to

1206
01:10:23,381 --> 01:10:28,030
get rid of these reactions faster like
detoxification things or mostly just

1207
01:10:28,031 --> 01:10:31,330
different weird different sort of
detoxification things and nothing's

1208
01:10:31,331 --> 01:10:35,500
helped except the sauna they still last
for as long with they're not as awful.

1209
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:40,910
So I was telling you that this guy Kevin
Bass who's P.H.

1210
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:45,980
Dean a scientist and he contacted me and
I contacted him put on my glasses I can

1211
01:10:48,401 --> 01:10:52,840
see you better.
And he we went back and forth about this

1212
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,960
online and so he sent me a bunch of
stuff what he thinks.

1213
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:04,620
And one of them is nutrient deficiency
and that

1214
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:12,340
immuno suppression from a nutrient
deficiency and that in the ideas that

1215
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:19,230
maybe in having less nutrients and
having less that you're a dietary immuno

1216
01:11:22,931 --> 01:11:27,931
suppression V A deficiency might be
helping you.

1217
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:33,050
Oh and he said basically crazier things
have happened and that you reported

1218
01:11:33,051 --> 01:11:36,050
still having symptoms when you get sick
even on a carnivore diet.

1219
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:40,400
And he said this shows that the
carnivore diet is a symptomatic

1220
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:42,020
treatment.
It's not because she's removed the

1221
01:11:42,021 --> 01:11:47,021
offending antigen but yeah so I don't
even know if I understood all that

1222
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:51,250
properly.
Well this is a very long.

1223
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,780
He wrote a very very long piece on this
and I appreciate that he took the time

1224
01:11:55,781 --> 01:11:58,870
to do this.
One of the things that is saying is like

1225
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:04,350
Vitamin A and that this this that this
diet could be vitamin A deficient

1226
01:12:05,431 --> 01:12:09,780
Vitamin C deficient we went over the
thing is I have an E deficient vitamin K

1227
01:12:09,781 --> 01:12:14,781
deficient.
So you got your results back so you got

1228
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:17,330
tested in my vitamin K.

1229
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:22,460
Everything's good is normal vitamin A's
normal normal like above it says

1230
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:28,010
anything above 30 is okay for vitamin K
to minus 40 everything about 70 is okay

1231
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:31,800
for vitamin A mind seventy nine mm hmm.

1232
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:35,760
He said also that a lot of your symptoms
including joint destruction fatigue

1233
01:12:35,761 --> 01:12:39,510
depression etc. can be caused by the
drugs that are used to treat rheumatoid

1234
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:42,360
arthritis although our rheumatoid
arthritis came first though.

1235
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:43,620
Mm hmm.
Right.

1236
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:47,040
But then the joint destruction was that.

1237
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:50,470
How do you test was that post that you
being on those medications were those

1238
01:12:50,471 --> 01:12:52,410
studies even done.
How do you test that.

1239
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:54,820
I mean it's the drugs or the arthritis
causing it.

1240
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:57,390
I don't know.
I mean this is his take on this is the

1241
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:00,820
potential scenarios.
I mean without rejecting it totally.

1242
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:06,330
You were on those drugs far far earlier
than your joints destroyed right.

1243
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:11,230
Yeah I started the drugs.
Grade 4 and then grade eleven.

1244
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,480
Mm hmm.
Were the replacements.

1245
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:19,030
Yeah.
Look this is this whole thing is a very

1246
01:13:19,031 --> 01:13:24,031
fascinating subject because people are
not having the response that

1247
01:13:24,581 --> 01:13:28,810
nutritionists would like them to have no
right nutritionist would like you guys

1248
01:13:28,811 --> 01:13:32,260
to be freaking out falling apart.
And it seems to be doing well.

1249
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:35,440
I have a friend of mine lives in San
Diego who's been on the carnivore diet

1250
01:13:35,441 --> 01:13:37,120
for a while and you know he's a Navy
SEAL.

1251
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:41,200
He said he feels fucking fantastic.
You said you know he said You just tried

1252
01:13:41,201 --> 01:13:43,540
it out see what it was like.
He's never felt better in his whole

1253
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:47,650
life.
Yeah elimination diets.

1254
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:52,770
This is this is a big thing like getting
getting yourself down to a very small

1255
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:57,640
number of foods
you know and that this seems to have

1256
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,160
some sort of a a large benefit for
people as well.

1257
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,840
Yeah I mean I think it would depend on
the foods you know it's like your body

1258
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:07,600
not having too much to manage.

1259
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:12,870
And people with
autoimmune disorders and diseases.

1260
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:18,320
Having less to manage could potentially
be what.

1261
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:19,660
What is benefiting you as well.

1262
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,990
I don't play as last though because if
you survived only off of soy you're not

1263
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:25,330
going to do well.
I think it depends what you're eating.

1264
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:29,380
One of the things that he's saying too
is that when you get sick the systemic

1265
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:33,550
inflammation probably opens up your
intestinal barrier which causes auto

1266
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:37,690
immune systems to kick in again and said
the same thing happens with any food

1267
01:14:37,691 --> 01:14:39,850
that causes your intestinal barrier to
open up.

1268
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:45,400
He said Why is this happening I don't
understand and that you and your father

1269
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:47,980
both think this could be some sort of
hereditary thing.

1270
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:50,400
Have you guys done any twenty three and
me test.

1271
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:51,850
Yeah.
And what is that.

1272
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:56,470
I have an genotype for a different gene
disorders perhaps.

1273
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,760
Yeah.
Nothing showed up.

1274
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,720
I ran it I ran it through Rhonda Patrick
has something on her Web site right.

1275
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,580
I ran it through that I ran it through
Prometheus.

1276
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,870
Nothing shocking shows up.
I have a celiac Gene.

1277
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:11,590
Dad doesn't.
So that's not exactly the issue.

1278
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:15,000
That was it.
Wow.

1279
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:22,080
The whole thing is just it's one of the
more interesting things is how people

1280
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,840
they always want to attach all these
other things to it that environmental

1281
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:33,510
concerns and the concern for you know
the the health and welfare of these

1282
01:15:33,671 --> 01:15:38,671
animals and that you're supporting
factory farming and always that it gets

1283
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:42,250
very it gets very ideological.

1284
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,850
Oh yes super fast real quick.
Right.

1285
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:48,940
But does not we're talking about.
No I also I don't like I'm concerned

1286
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:51,670
about other people who are suffering as
much as I was suffering.

1287
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,830
Yeah that's it.

1288
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,090
Right before you're concerned with
animals like everything a way before

1289
01:15:58,130 --> 01:15:59,290
like try living.

1290
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:03,970
If your choice is to live with an
autoimmune disorder and like die slowly

1291
01:16:03,971 --> 01:16:08,150
that way you can do that and not eat
meat if you want to.

1292
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:11,780
Well this.
It's also I think a disingenuous

1293
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:16,610
argument because 97 percent of the
people in the world eat meat or

1294
01:16:16,611 --> 01:16:17,380
something.

1295
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:20,270
So it's easy to tell other people that
when you're not experiencing those

1296
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:22,160
symptoms it's also.

1297
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:23,323
Yeah.
I mean

1298
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:28,210
definitely it's definitely easier if
you're not experiencing those symptoms

1299
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:30,850
but there's so much meat eating going on
already.

1300
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:36,440
And if you if if people really can
benefit greatly from just an all meat

1301
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,840
diet
we're going to tell them Don't do that.

1302
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:47,930
Go vegan and keep us pagan and be
covered in hives and itching and and

1303
01:16:48,421 --> 01:16:50,980
being depressed states the rest of your
life.

1304
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,173
Yeah.

1305
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:58,040
It's just it's such a hot subject and I
feel like this is something that we're

1306
01:16:59,311 --> 01:17:01,530
gonna have more insight on over the next
few years.

1307
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,240
Oh yeah.
We're starting to study it now and it's

1308
01:17:03,241 --> 01:17:07,560
starting to be mean.
You know Shawn Baker who's you know he's

1309
01:17:07,561 --> 01:17:12,360
a physician and then you've got some
really dedicated athletes that are

1310
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:14,040
trying it now.
You know Zach bitter.

1311
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:18,150
Mm hmm.
Who heal what does he owe on the North

1312
01:17:18,151 --> 01:17:20,850
American record for 24 hour race.
Wow.

1313
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:26,270
Or if not for 24 hours for 100 miles he
ran 100 miles in 11 hours and 40 minutes

1314
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:31,720
which is how fucking insane.
And he eats almost nothing but meat.

1315
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:33,390
Yes.
Almost his entire died.

1316
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:38,420
He supplements with high levels of
glucose like those gels and shit like

1317
01:17:39,181 --> 01:17:41,310
that.
And Ramsey's carbs way up when he's

1318
01:17:41,311 --> 01:17:43,410
going to do 100 mile races and things
like that.

1319
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:47,400
But that's that's honestly a ridiculous
requirement on his body.

1320
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:50,850
He's Yeah.
He's asking his body to run 100 fucking

1321
01:17:50,851 --> 01:17:54,550
miles and 11 hours and 40 minutes.
Wow.

1322
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:56,970
Wow.
Yeah that's crazy.

1323
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,260
He also weighs five pounds.
Yeah.

1324
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:03,660
It's just.
He weighs like a hundred forty but it's

1325
01:18:03,661 --> 01:18:08,661
just you know his his his diet shows
that it is possible to do extreme

1326
01:18:10,321 --> 01:18:12,270
physical feats while while you're on
this.

1327
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:15,060
Yeah he does a podcasts also with Shawn
Baker.

1328
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:21,680
So this is something that people are
really starting to study now and there's

1329
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:26,580
a lot of argument there's a lot of
hesitancy not anger.

1330
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:30,960
Oh I've read some article today
criticizing you and your dad and now.

1331
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,150
Yeah.
That's okay.

1332
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:36,480
I find it kind of like I can understand
a lot of people who go on that kind of

1333
01:18:36,481 --> 01:18:39,920
raw diet get really like vegan Haiti.
Well that's what I was doing.

1334
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,610
They were.
Well that's true.

1335
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:44,280
But what they were doing is they're
going off about the environment.

1336
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,930
This was like like methane gas produced
by cows.

1337
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,850
I don't think I saw this article.
It's just it's not it's not a good

1338
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:54,400
argument because this is this is
happening like if you're a person.

1339
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:59,510
OK I'm not saying that you we don't all
have a responsibility to do our part to

1340
01:18:59,761 --> 01:19:00,720
try to save the environment.

1341
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:03,840
But if you're a person who is deathly
ill you go to the supermarket there's a

1342
01:19:03,841 --> 01:19:06,840
lot of fucking beef you can go buy beef.
It's right there.

1343
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:08,670
Yeah.
If you could buy that beef and it fixes

1344
01:19:08,671 --> 01:19:12,840
you what.
Why don't you stop and think about the

1345
01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:17,040
ecological concerns the environmental
concerns and then the physical concerns

1346
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:21,750
of people that are forced to take on
these fucking ridiculous pharmaceutical

1347
01:19:21,751 --> 01:19:24,720
medications.
Oh my God times years into their lives

1348
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:28,950
and think about you're also empowering
these pharmaceutical companies and

1349
01:19:28,951 --> 01:19:33,600
they're lobbying to stop natural natural
cures.

1350
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:35,870
They're they're trying to make kratom
illegal.

1351
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,900
There's there's a lot of thuggery that's
involved in pharmaceutical companies

1352
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:44,160
that we're well aware of.
A lot of cherry picking studies.

1353
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,730
Yeah they'll do 100 hundred studies one
of them shows that there might be some

1354
01:19:47,731 --> 01:19:51,150
benefit to this.
Ninety nine shows it fucks you up and

1355
01:19:51,151 --> 01:19:53,070
they ignore those and they're allowed to
do this.

1356
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:57,210
There's a lot of weird shit that we
really should take into consideration

1357
01:19:57,211 --> 01:20:00,060
before we support any sort of
pharmaceutical alternative and

1358
01:20:00,061 --> 01:20:03,870
pharmaceutical drugs aren't demons.
There's a lot of people that benefit

1359
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,280
greatly from pharmaceutical drugs.

1360
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,320
I did.
I don't think I would have been able to

1361
01:20:07,321 --> 01:20:10,530
figure this out unless I'd been on
Adderall and had the energy to Google

1362
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:11,700
I'm sure.

1363
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:15,090
I mean look there's these benefits it's
not they're not all bad.

1364
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:18,450
They're not all good.
But I don't like that argument like hey

1365
01:20:18,451 --> 01:20:22,650
you know if you go on the carnivore diet
you're you're contributing to methane

1366
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,870
that's fucking up the world.
OK.

1367
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,050
Is it better or worse than
pharmaceutical drugs.

1368
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:31,060
Is it better or worse than what they're
doing.

1369
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:33,970
Is it better or worse the fact that foot
pharmaceutical drugs are in the water

1370
01:20:33,971 --> 01:20:36,580
supply.
You know they've they've done tests on

1371
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:38,860
reservoirs and found pharmaceutical
drugs in them.

1372
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,050
They've found pharmaceutical drugs in
rivers.

1373
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,100
Fish.
Yeah.

1374
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:43,900
Lakes.
Shut the fuck up.

1375
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:45,790
There's a lot going on here.
Don't don't.

1376
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:48,730
If you're going to look at this you
better look at it in a if you want to

1377
01:20:48,731 --> 01:20:52,390
make an argument against it you better
be balanced about this because otherwise

1378
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:57,190
you're showing your ideological bend
like to say that it's about methane and

1379
01:20:57,191 --> 01:21:01,420
about cows and factory farming.
Not really no.

1380
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:03,500
There's a lot going on.
There's a lot going on yeah.

1381
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:08,380
It's this is a there's a long and
nuanced discussion and if you're you're

1382
01:21:08,381 --> 01:21:13,381
painting this this article in one way
and talking only about the negative

1383
01:21:14,951 --> 01:21:18,310
health and negative environmental
concerns that are associated with beef

1384
01:21:18,311 --> 01:21:21,820
production like look that beef
production is going on a matter with you

1385
01:21:21,821 --> 01:21:23,100
like it or not.
Yeah.

1386
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:26,410
If you think we can curb it back and
slow it down a little bit that would be

1387
01:21:26,411 --> 01:21:29,650
wonderful.
But we have to look at it accurately you

1388
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:34,450
know and also I believe they've proven
that methane see.

1389
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:39,100
Google if this is true that Methane
production from cows and Sony makes

1390
01:21:39,101 --> 01:21:44,050
sense is far less when they're on a
natural diet when their pasture raised

1391
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,620
than it is if they're corn fed.
But it makes sense because they have all

1392
01:21:47,621 --> 01:21:48,490
sorts of corn.

1393
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:49,000
Yeah.

1394
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,460
And also it's Ishan idea when they're
eating grain.

1395
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:58,000
You know that that could easily be a
part of the problem is they're trying to

1396
01:21:58,001 --> 01:22:01,000
fatten these cows up quicker and they're
forced them to eat something that's not

1397
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:04,120
natural for their body.
Have you ever seen that King Corn

1398
01:22:04,121 --> 01:22:07,870
documentary.
No great documentary but it's a real

1399
01:22:07,871 --> 01:22:09,840
corn.
Yeah it's a mindfuck corns and

1400
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:13,570
everything.
Everything in your DNA like your whole

1401
01:22:13,571 --> 01:22:14,950
body's like filled with corn.

1402
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:18,910
That's crazy because there's so much I
want to hear that it's crazy.

1403
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:20,170
They've done.
They did.

1404
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:24,260
These guys did tests on the carbon in
their body and they found corn is in

1405
01:22:24,261 --> 01:22:27,070
their body.
Yeah things the carbon in their body

1406
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:30,930
whatever it was they just eat they go
through the supermarket aisle and they

1407
01:22:30,931 --> 01:22:33,310
find how many things have corn in them.
Yeah.

1408
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:35,410
And that corn is subsidized by the
government.

1409
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:38,620
So I grant soy and everything.
Yeah.

1410
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:44,310
I did the articles but again this is
this is also part of the problem.

1411
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:48,910
These people who are writing these
articles about your diet and about your

1412
01:22:48,911 --> 01:22:51,540
dad and in his heart.

1413
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:55,180
This is just taking a shot at dad.
So yeah that's the other problem.

1414
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,070
Yeah.
Certainly a lot of that.

1415
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,970
But no the articles aren't great.
I mean it would be nice if someone

1416
01:23:00,971 --> 01:23:05,971
instead of saying maybe she didn't have
arthritis or maybe she's just placebo

1417
01:23:06,011 --> 01:23:09,820
balling herself into this.
Or maybe it's deprivation that's making

1418
01:23:09,821 --> 01:23:13,000
her feel better.
It could be nice if someone actually did

1419
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:13,834
a study.

1420
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:17,050
What does it say Jamie.
It says cows are being fed a new dye

1421
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:20,860
they reduce the amount of burping and
cut emission methane by 20 percent.

1422
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:24,340
From 2008 article.
What are they being fed.

1423
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,720
What's this new diet didn't specifically
say I don't think they're being fed

1424
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:32,680
other cows.
Cow what does it say.

1425
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:36,370
Okay.
Special machines used to cut the straw.

1426
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:38,270
Okay.
But still huh.

1427
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:39,453
Yeah.

1428
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:44,670
Mixed with Slash edge silage wheat maize
soya or sugar beet which can be mixed

1429
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:48,110
with.
Yeah.

1430
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:54,050
See if you google
methane by cows who are pasture raised

1431
01:23:57,430 --> 01:24:01,390
methane by cows methane produced by cows
were grass fed.

1432
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:05,860
See if there's land weirdly enough I
thought I read that it was grain fed

1433
01:24:05,861 --> 01:24:09,580
cows that produce less nothing really.
Which isn't what I would have guessed.

1434
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:14,910
That's interesting grass fed cattle do
more methane what does produce produce

1435
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:21,951
do more methane on the foot.
I'm not reading that grass cattle dupe.

1436
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:28,170
Produce do more methane because it's
harder to digest OK obviously to produce

1437
01:24:28,171 --> 01:24:31,260
more methane because it's harder to
digest grass than grain.

1438
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:36,290
However some argue grass that is
continually grazed by grass fed cattle

1439
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,990
sequesters enough carbon to make up the
difference in methane.

1440
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:40,920
OK.
That's what it is.

1441
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,950
Yeah.
And healthy soil keeps carbon dioxide

1442
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:46,470
underground in the atmosphere.
OK.

1443
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,540
Yeah there's a big story behind there.
Right.

1444
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:52,950
So that's why it's it's better for the
environment if they eat grass which

1445
01:24:52,951 --> 01:24:55,230
totally makes sense because they've been
eating grass for a million years.

1446
01:24:55,340 --> 01:25:00,340
Yeah yeah.
So so here you are here you are on this

1447
01:25:01,081 --> 01:25:05,670
diet now and you've started to what are
you doing consulting people online.

1448
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:10,850
So I am now yeah I started about a month
ago and how what does that involve

1449
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,860
people Skype me and basically.

1450
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:20,270
Want to see me and how I'm still alive
only eating beef and then they ask me

1451
01:25:21,081 --> 01:25:25,130
how to cook and things because nobody
knows how to cook meat without anything

1452
01:25:25,131 --> 01:25:27,110
on it.
Well how do you cook like how do you

1453
01:25:27,111 --> 01:25:29,150
cook with just beef.
They don't know what to do.

1454
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:31,280
They're like what oil do you use.
I don't use oil

1455
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:36,720
I think most of these people I've been
talking to a lot of low I used tallow.

1456
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Used a lot but most of these people are
really sick and really desperate.

1457
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:49,890
And they haven't had any help from the
medical system and so far and this is

1458
01:25:49,961 --> 01:25:53,800
completely true.
Anybody who's gone on to this like beef

1459
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:57,670
and salt and water diet anybody I've
seen who's been able to stick through

1460
01:25:57,671 --> 01:26:02,620
that transition period where you get off
of carbs and explosive diarrhea not

1461
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:05,030
everyone gets that Dad didn't get what
you want.

1462
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:09,170
Like it seems to be 50/50.
It looks like the sicker you are seven.

1463
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:11,230
Yeah.

1464
01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:15,460
No it seems to be but like seriously 50
percent of people and it seems like the

1465
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:18,610
sicker you are the more likely you are
to get that and I don't all of its

1466
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:23,050
inability to digest that amount of fat
right away or if it's a microbiome

1467
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,430
switch or something but it seems to hit
50 percent of people the other 50

1468
01:26:27,431 --> 01:26:30,460
percent just switch over.
But everybody gets some sort of carb

1469
01:26:30,461 --> 01:26:34,230
withdrawal especially if you go from
like a standard American diet over then

1470
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,530
it's insane cravings.

1471
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:38,920
Oh do you get your ketones checked if
you don't like data.

1472
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,470
I went to paleo effects this year.

1473
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:46,000
And I got my ketones checked and they
were ridiculously high.

1474
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:48,510
That was with a breath test.
Mm hmm.

1475
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:52,690
And then I have like urine strep tests
which I know aren't as accurate but I

1476
01:26:52,691 --> 01:26:57,430
haven't gone out of ketosis my diets
about 80 percent calories from fat.

1477
01:26:57,970 --> 01:27:02,330
So it's them.
I eat ribs which are really fatty.

1478
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:05,620
I eat ribeye sometimes but I find eating
more and more fat.

1479
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:09,910
So just caloric Lee I'm getting about 80
percent from the fat.

1480
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:13,690
Mm hmm.
See I eat a lot of meat but eating

1481
01:27:13,990 --> 01:27:17,020
really lean meat because I'm eating a
lot of wild game.

1482
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,920
Mm hmm.
I'm not getting as much fat thank the

1483
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:23,260
fats the good stuff.
But definitely it has a factor.

1484
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:25,240
Mm hmm.
I just finished I didn't finish.

1485
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:29,230
I'm halfway through a book called Fat of
the land by I'm going to butcher this

1486
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:33,730
but like ville how your Steffensen and
it was this dude who went to live with

1487
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:36,870
you at people in Canada for five years
and eight eight like they eight.

1488
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:41,620
And it's amazing like historically it
shows how they dressed and how they

1489
01:27:41,621 --> 01:27:43,980
lived and what parts of the animal they
ate.

1490
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:47,830
And so he lived off of what they eat
which was basically just meat and

1491
01:27:47,831 --> 01:27:51,730
sometimes eggs for five years and then
he came back.

1492
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,760
I don't know if he was in England or in
the States but he came back and said hey

1493
01:27:54,761 --> 01:27:56,620
look how healthy I am.
All I eat is meat.

1494
01:27:56,890 --> 01:28:00,520
This isn't like the 30s.
And they said no way you're supposed to

1495
01:28:00,521 --> 01:28:04,660
have scurvy.
So him and his partner who is his last

1496
01:28:04,661 --> 01:28:09,661
names Anderson went to Bellevue horse
hospital and they stayed under monitor

1497
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:13,120
just eating meat for a year.
And there are six studies done on them

1498
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:17,050
and you can find them online.
And they monitored like vitamin levels.

1499
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:21,550
They monitor over everything because
kidney function because back then like

1500
01:28:21,551 --> 01:28:24,100
nothing's changed in the last hundred
years they said you're supposed to be

1501
01:28:24,101 --> 01:28:27,910
dead of scurvy.
So I'm reading that book and he says.

1502
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:30,760
That was one of the main things they
ate.

1503
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:32,410
They also didn't eat any salt.

1504
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:39,290
No they were eating like whale blubber
and seal fat.

1505
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:44,030
So those lines mostly karibu karibu they
also has a brain though.

1506
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,630
Yeah.
But they I ate he said they gave a lot

1507
01:28:47,631 --> 01:28:52,020
of the really lean cuts to the dogs so
they ate a lot of the fatty or cuts they

1508
01:28:52,021 --> 01:28:53,840
ate the brain.
They eat fat behind.

1509
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,750
He goes into some serious detail a fat
behind the eyes.

1510
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,540
Yeah.
They boiled a lot.

1511
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:02,930
They boiled bones for the marrow so they
got fat out of that.

1512
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:07,080
And then for part of the year they'd
also eat seal the fat behind the eyes.

1513
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:10,790
Tastes like it's like bread like dough
you know that.

1514
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:12,380
Yeah.
I haven't had that.

1515
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:14,990
Yeah.
How did the first deer I shot.

1516
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:18,760
We eat the fat behind eyes tastes.
It's like good.

1517
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:22,140
No
no

1518
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:26,600
it's it's not the best guy.

1519
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,580
But it's it's definitely.
It's just weird like like doe.

1520
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:34,760
That's weird huh.
Yeah it's a good book though and it

1521
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:38,840
there is another person who was just
eating meat and for some reason people

1522
01:29:38,841 --> 01:29:39,674
have forgotten about him.

1523
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:44,860
So like maybe the best deal would be
those really fat Japanese cows was Kobe

1524
01:29:45,021 --> 01:29:46,170
beef cows or why.

1525
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:49,390
Yeah because those are fat as fuck.
Yes.

1526
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:53,120
Those things you you look at those
marble cuts and you like when they're

1527
01:29:53,121 --> 01:29:54,620
doing a cow.
I don't know.

1528
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:56,660
It's terrible.
Probably nothing good.

1529
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:59,480
Yeah I think good.
Now those poor cows.

1530
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:01,490
Yeah.
What I've been doing recently which is a

1531
01:30:01,491 --> 01:30:05,840
lot cheaper is getting ground beef which
is lean and adding tallow and just

1532
01:30:05,841 --> 01:30:08,990
frying it.
That makes sense and it's way cheaper

1533
01:30:08,991 --> 01:30:13,310
than steak but it's super fatty just
spoonfuls of tallow in there and you

1534
01:30:13,311 --> 01:30:15,320
just eat it is put in a bowl and eat it.

1535
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:17,000
Are you getting bored with this.

1536
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:22,090
No no not at all.
So after the first week sucked because

1537
01:30:22,091 --> 01:30:26,830
first line kind of sucks I was one of
the reason it sucked but I was also like

1538
01:30:26,831 --> 01:30:29,470
a missing salad.
I was having and I only went from Greens

1539
01:30:29,471 --> 01:30:34,471
down so it's a pretty easy transition
kinda by the rest your family almost

1540
01:30:34,761 --> 01:30:36,100
died as well as your whole mass.

1541
01:30:36,490 --> 01:30:39,030
Yeah he's on it as well.
Yeah really.

1542
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:41,320
And how does he have any issues health
issues.

1543
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:45,420
He was depressed and pretty severe
depression really.

1544
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:48,770
Know what was causing his depression
like foods.

1545
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:54,010
He had the same issues as me and I know
how that sounds but my dad was like this

1546
01:30:54,111 --> 01:30:56,220
seems to be genetic.
How can you have it too.

1547
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,330
Well but so it's not genetic.

1548
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:02,250
Hmm that's interesting.

1549
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:03,760
Yeah.
Action.

1550
01:31:04,210 --> 01:31:06,220
Well he was like this is a little
incredulous.

1551
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:09,520
Well I mean those food reactions were
kind of strange.

1552
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:12,490
You know people have like weird
sympathetic disorders you know like

1553
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:16,110
someone around them has something they
start to develop the same sense.

1554
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:19,210
So that's what dad was thinking.
It wasn't like this though he'll turn

1555
01:31:19,211 --> 01:31:22,090
green his skin turns a different color
when he was the wrong thing.

1556
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:26,470
Yeah I mean not like green but he gets
pale you can see it.

1557
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,680
Huh.
Oh one thing I wanted to address when I

1558
01:31:29,681 --> 01:31:33,670
was on here in Sean Baker's episode he
said something about eating apples that

1559
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:36,910
gave him low back pain and you were like
apples give you low back pain and people

1560
01:31:36,911 --> 01:31:40,840
in the comments were freaking out.
Well that's a symptom that happens to me

1561
01:31:40,841 --> 01:31:44,320
too.
And it's not over yet when my mood drops

1562
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:48,940
I get lower back pain and so does dad.
And it's funny to freak out about to get

1563
01:31:48,941 --> 01:31:53,941
it but that's very commonly associated
with depression and it is triggered by

1564
01:31:54,431 --> 01:31:55,540
food with me too.

1565
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:59,800
Well I know that that's triggered by
some people that have lower back issues

1566
01:31:59,801 --> 01:32:04,030
when they eat and flip inflammation
causing foods like pasta and sugar.

1567
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:05,530
Yeah.
Mm hmm.

1568
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:10,510
So I went to a physical therapist once
when I was having had a bulging disc in

1569
01:32:10,511 --> 01:32:13,540
my neck and she suggested that I cut out
gluten.

1570
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:17,020
I thought she's a crazy person now what
are you talking about cut out gluten.

1571
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:21,010
My cousin she was I know it sounds crazy
but a lot of these things cause issues

1572
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:24,650
and they causes inflammation.
That was like the first steps that I

1573
01:32:24,651 --> 01:32:25,960
thought was the first idea.
Gluten.

1574
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:28,540
Yeah.
Well also the first steps that I took to

1575
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:31,270
understand that foods cause
inflammation.

1576
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:34,660
I had never thought of that at all.
I thought oh no someone yanked on my

1577
01:32:34,661 --> 01:32:36,670
neck and then my next her and tried to
fix it.

1578
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:40,060
How do you fix my neck.
And but when she was saying this that

1579
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:44,680
the reduction of inflammation causing
foods would lead to healing in certain

1580
01:32:44,681 --> 01:32:47,680
issues.
I was very incredulous.

1581
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:50,740
Sounds like some fucking wacky car Yeah.

1582
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:51,430
Bullshit.

1583
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:56,140
Yeah but there's something to it.
And you know there's there's something

1584
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:58,960
too.
First of all the weight reduction soon

1585
01:32:58,961 --> 01:33:03,880
as you cut out all these sugary foods
and your body's just carrying less stuff

1586
01:33:03,881 --> 01:33:05,200
around you carrying less meat.

1587
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:09,560
I mean and people don't realize how much
it has to do a workout do like a body

1588
01:33:09,561 --> 01:33:11,680
weight workout.
Now do that same body weight workout

1589
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:15,340
with a 40 pound vest on it's way harder
fucking way harder.

1590
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:17,740
Yeah.
And most people out there wandering

1591
01:33:17,741 --> 01:33:20,410
around Italy's 40 pounds overweight at
least 40 pounds.

1592
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,600
Yeah it's a lot of weight.
A lot of weight.

1593
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:27,850
You know I do this I have this this
backpack that I put metal plates on.

1594
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,120
It's it's by this company called
outdoorsman.

1595
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:35,560
And it's like a basically leg of the
frame of a hiking backpack.

1596
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:39,940
He snap it in and it puts an Olympic
plate on the back and locks it in place

1597
01:33:39,941 --> 01:33:42,160
allow.
So that it really centers in your back

1598
01:33:42,161 --> 01:33:45,670
as opposed to like a lot of people do
weighted hikes but they put sandbags in

1599
01:33:45,671 --> 01:33:47,230
there and it kind of shifts and moves
around.

1600
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:49,690
But this was like really centers in and
locks it in place.

1601
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:55,080
But if I do 45 pounds and I go hiking
around like it kind of kicks my ass it's

1602
01:33:55,391 --> 01:34:00,100
hard going up and also 45 pounds.
Think about what most people just go

1603
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:04,570
through life with a lot of people go.
Your dad was 50 50 pounds overweight.

1604
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:05,740
Yeah.
Think of that.

1605
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:09,140
It's a lot of weight on that whereas
your ass out that.

1606
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,130
And then that's one of the reasons why
people say they don't have the energy to

1607
01:34:12,131 --> 01:34:16,990
exercise so carrying around all this way
their ass I was like it like really

1608
01:34:16,991 --> 01:34:20,770
heavy overweight persons people and I
look at their legs and like that dude

1609
01:34:20,771 --> 01:34:24,580
probably can kick through a wall.
Someone could teach him how to kick like

1610
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:27,370
think about how much weight you're
carrying around the time their knees are

1611
01:34:27,371 --> 01:34:31,510
probably super strong like all the
tissue around their legs just constantly

1612
01:34:31,511 --> 01:34:34,250
carrying this heavy load upstairs.
Yeah.

1613
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:37,180
If you could lose weight you'd probably
have amazing legs.

1614
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:40,300
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Now look at diet.

1615
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:45,870
So how do you go though from this to
doing consulting and is it.

1616
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:49,870
Is it a big leap to like.
I mean you're just trying to figure your

1617
01:34:49,871 --> 01:34:52,440
own life out to try to help other people
online.

1618
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:54,190
You don't have a degree in nutrition or
anything.

1619
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:54,760
Right.

1620
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:57,970
God no.
Well but what am I going to get a degree

1621
01:34:57,971 --> 01:34:58,990
in nutrition for.

1622
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,460
They still teach people eat grain so
that was never in the books.

1623
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:09,520
Do you think that today like if you went
to a university today like a really good

1624
01:35:09,741 --> 01:35:12,230
school do you think there would still be
saying that grains are good.

1625
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:13,183
Good idea to eat.

1626
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,083
I do.

1627
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:19,300
I don't know that so I could be wrong
but yeah I would say it's still pretty

1628
01:35:19,371 --> 01:35:24,130
food pyramid de
Well I don't know if they go the old way

1629
01:35:24,131 --> 01:35:28,210
with the like when you read and I don't
change them as all rice and wheat.

1630
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:32,530
I don't think it's really changed.
I think it's like eat a good mix of Make

1631
01:35:32,531 --> 01:35:35,810
sure you get your fruits and vegetables
grains.

1632
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:37,690
That's what they tell you when you're
pregnant.

1633
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:40,810
But for most people I don't think so
grain really.

1634
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:44,050
We've been eating grain for what like
maybe twenty thousand years in some

1635
01:35:44,051 --> 01:35:46,750
areas.
More like 10000 years and in some areas

1636
01:35:46,751 --> 01:35:51,460
2000 years and if you're Native American
like 200 years haven't been eating grain

1637
01:35:51,461 --> 01:35:55,210
for very long Why do people suddenly
think they can digest that just because

1638
01:35:55,211 --> 01:36:00,110
we're people
so you don't believe Rice.

1639
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:04,640
Rice is a green rice I think is a lot
less inflammatory than some grains like

1640
01:36:04,641 --> 01:36:07,520
the gluten grains are obviously a lot
harder on people.

1641
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:10,880
And even I tolerated Rice kind of for a
while.

1642
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:15,110
But yeah I don't think grains feed a lot
of people.

1643
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:18,040
And so that's why the agricultural error
came around now.

1644
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:21,320
We can feed tons of people which doesn't
make people thrive and I don't think

1645
01:36:21,321 --> 01:36:23,660
it's good for their god.
I don't think that's surprising

1646
01:36:23,661 --> 01:36:26,660
considering we haven't been eating it
long enough to evolve with it.

1647
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:31,760
But other than grain what are the issues
you have with what we would call like a

1648
01:36:31,761 --> 01:36:33,590
paleo diet or a healthy diet.

1649
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:39,680
So with vegetables and do you think
there's an issue eating vegetables.

1650
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:45,530
I think it really depends on the person.
I think that this beef salt and water

1651
01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:50,531
diet is a really good elimination diet.
And if you're seriously suffering and

1652
01:36:50,601 --> 01:36:54,920
you have nothing to lose you can give it
a go suffer through the transition

1653
01:36:54,921 --> 01:36:58,850
period and then try and once you feel OK
try and reintroduce foods and see where

1654
01:36:58,851 --> 01:36:59,684
you stand.

1655
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:04,430
What about vitamin supplementation
though and why wouldn't you tell people

1656
01:37:04,431 --> 01:37:08,510
what move why wouldn't you recommend
multivitamins or a multivitamin pack

1657
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,370
that covers all your basics.

1658
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,600
I say if you want if you're really
concerned about vitamins get vitamin

1659
01:37:14,601 --> 01:37:18,860
infusions I react to multi vitamins so
the fillers there aren't any pure

1660
01:37:18,861 --> 01:37:21,710
vitamins you can take unless you take
them in powder form so you can get

1661
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:26,330
vitamin C powder potassium powder but
it's hard to get the other vitamins in

1662
01:37:26,331 --> 01:37:30,950
powder form and I react to everything.
So so even the filler often caps

1663
01:37:32,450 --> 01:37:36,080
I probably wouldn't react to pure
gelatin capsules but like filler what

1664
01:37:36,081 --> 01:37:39,500
kind of filler micro appears to lean
cellulose isn't a lot of them.

1665
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:43,770
Why do they put that stuff in there.
Well a lot of them is to bind it

1666
01:37:43,771 --> 01:37:48,000
together you know if it's like a tablet
then most of that is like powdery stuff

1667
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:50,460
that isn't the actual vitamin.
What about capsules.

1668
01:37:51,690 --> 01:37:55,920
I don't know.
I haven't tested it out like buy because

1669
01:37:55,921 --> 01:37:58,960
it's this month long reaction I pretty
much just say get rid of all the

1670
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:03,060
variables you can get rid of and start
from scratch and then you can see if if

1671
01:38:03,061 --> 01:38:05,850
things are bothering you if you're
worried about vitamins get infusions.

1672
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:08,850
Right.
But what I was saying is that you were

1673
01:38:08,851 --> 01:38:12,210
talking about these binders do they
exist in capsules as well.

1674
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:16,350
Yeah you have to check the ingredients.
There are just it's very hard to get

1675
01:38:16,351 --> 01:38:20,010
vitamins that are pure unless they're in
powdered form or either by infusion.

1676
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:24,180
I couldn't find a multivitamin I could
take a lot of the vitamin KS derived

1677
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:27,060
from soy so I'll react to that amount of
soy.

1678
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:28,283
Mm hmm.

1679
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:31,450
Wow.
So infusions you're talking about.

1680
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:37,220
Yeah and I did those though I did that
during my pregnancy because just in case

1681
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:42,270
I don't react to that at all is fine I
didn't find I didn't see a benefit.

1682
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:47,390
It didn't make me feel any better.
How do you react to fish oil not well

1683
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:53,580
but it was hard to tell because I was
reacting to other things at the same

1684
01:38:53,581 --> 01:38:57,870
time so I don't I don't eat chicken
anymore and I don't eat fish anymore

1685
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,970
because it doesn't make me feel as good
as beef

1686
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:03,470
but it doesn't give you a bad reaction.

1687
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:06,830
Not like soy or grains.

1688
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:11,030
But what if someone took it to a
restaurant and lobster was on the menu.

1689
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:12,320
You would need a lobster.
No.

1690
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:13,573
Wow.

1691
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:20,310
No dessert.
No but the thing is the cravings go away

1692
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:24,330
after you transition over so I don't
even care how has gone

1693
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:29,430
three times usually.
If I'm doing more I eat more.

1694
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:32,370
Otherwise I'm eating about two and a
half pounds a day.

1695
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:34,170
If they're fat fatter then I'll eat
less.

1696
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,450
To just sort of walking beef
catastrophe.

1697
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:38,150
Yeah.
It's great though.

1698
01:39:38,370 --> 01:39:41,820
It's um it's amazing.
And I drink like sparkling water which I

1699
01:39:41,821 --> 01:39:43,920
love Perry excites me.

1700
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:47,100
So just Perrier and beef and salt.
That's a

1701
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,650
now.
What do you think about people that say

1702
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:55,651
that this idea might work in the short
term in the short term but in the long

1703
01:39:56,231 --> 01:39:57,910
term it's not sustainable.

1704
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,890
I don't even know what kind of response
to have to that like

1705
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:05,223
what I was doing.

1706
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:10,060
For example on vegan diets right.
With diets as they start off they feel

1707
01:40:10,061 --> 01:40:12,220
great.
They're like Oh my God this is the diet

1708
01:40:12,221 --> 01:40:15,340
for me this is amazing.
And over time their body starts reacting

1709
01:40:15,341 --> 01:40:20,260
to the lack of nutrients lack of
cholesterol lack of saturated fat and it

1710
01:40:20,261 --> 01:40:23,770
doesn't doesn't in different bodies.
I mean obviously some people have no

1711
01:40:23,771 --> 01:40:27,430
problem with it but some people have
like legitimate like Chris Crestor is a

1712
01:40:27,431 --> 01:40:30,400
perfect example.
He started out with a macrobiotic vegan

1713
01:40:30,401 --> 01:40:33,190
diet and had real serious reactions to
it over time.

1714
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:36,730
Yeah started out doing well.
And then over time started to break his

1715
01:40:36,731 --> 01:40:38,320
body down.
How long did it take.

1716
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:42,280
I forget but when he started
reintroducing meat back into his diet he

1717
01:40:42,281 --> 01:40:43,750
had a massive ramp up.

1718
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:49,150
You know it's ramp up like he got worse
health health while Oh yeah fantastic.

1719
01:40:49,190 --> 01:40:49,420
Yeah.

1720
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:51,280
And suddenly everything started kicking
in again.

1721
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:54,640
Yeah yeah.
So I'm not worried about it like I was

1722
01:40:54,641 --> 01:40:59,641
so sick before this and now I'm better.
What I was concerned I was going to die

1723
01:41:01,241 --> 01:41:03,880
in the long run before and now I'm
feeling good.

1724
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:07,270
I don't see why I would just randomly
get sick suddenly I'm getting my

1725
01:41:07,271 --> 01:41:11,710
vitamins tested because people are
curious but I I don't have any symptoms.

1726
01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:15,190
And who is this besides this woman.
Have you been in contact with this woman

1727
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:16,510
that's been doing this for nine years.

1728
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:19,080
Not personally no but where were you.

1729
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:20,820
Somewhere in the States.
Mm hmm.

1730
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:25,630
And so Sean Baker is probably the
loudest proponent and one of the most

1731
01:41:25,631 --> 01:41:30,520
vocal and more most public and he's been
doing it I believe two years

1732
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:35,800
my friend Chris Bell's been doing it for
a while as well.

1733
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:39,150
I think he's less than a year but he
apples.

1734
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:40,413
He loves apples.

1735
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:44,390
I had a hard time giving up apples.
Let's find Sara.

1736
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:48,160
Seriously it's because I limited I went
down on all my sugar and then I was

1737
01:41:48,161 --> 01:41:51,560
eating hoards of apples and that was my
sugar right.

1738
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:55,390
And that was hard to kick in apples.

1739
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:59,080
Somehow or another give you low back
pain among other things.

1740
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:00,540
But yeah.
Huh.

1741
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:03,310
It comes along with a depression and
arthritis

1742
01:42:05,570 --> 01:42:09,860
the whole thing is a really interesting
conversation because there's so much

1743
01:42:09,861 --> 01:42:13,400
going on with it.
It's and it's not an objective

1744
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:17,840
conversation for the most part.
Like many people that get into this they

1745
01:42:17,841 --> 01:42:22,810
get into this it's very charged it's
charged almost politically it's charged

1746
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:27,880
ideologically it's charged whether it's
ethically and morally it's it's charged

1747
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:33,080
where people are very skeptical.
Also they have this diet that they

1748
01:42:33,081 --> 01:42:36,530
believe in that they've been following.
And so anything that's contrary to that

1749
01:42:36,531 --> 01:42:37,364
they reject.

1750
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:41,040
Yeah well I used to be like people when
I was really sick.

1751
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:43,250
People come up and go Well have you
looked at your diet.

1752
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:49,390
It's like what you like me mean disorder
I'm dying have I like what stop eating

1753
01:42:50,091 --> 01:42:52,340
sugar and all my problems will go away
like thanks.

1754
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:56,600
So I've been on the other end of the
spectrum and I used to get mad when

1755
01:42:56,601 --> 01:42:59,540
people said but it was like
condescending right.

1756
01:42:59,690 --> 01:43:01,940
If you'd like tried.
Have you tried exercising have you

1757
01:43:01,941 --> 01:43:04,940
looked at your diet.
No it's like I'm dying.

1758
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:09,110
And then I thought maybe now that I look
back on it.

1759
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:12,500
How crazy is it then.
It wasn't even a conversation 10 years

1760
01:43:12,501 --> 01:43:13,340
ago right.

1761
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:15,830
Yeah like ten years ago.
You ever hear this.

1762
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,330
No.

1763
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:21,440
That's what's so weird like the cutting
the sugar out and cutting the carbs out.

1764
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:26,710
This is so new it's so new and this like
meat diets really now.

1765
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:30,590
And but by the way but when I say new I
mean in terms of like being popular

1766
01:43:30,591 --> 01:43:33,560
really popular like yeah or something
people have heard us.

1767
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:37,090
Yeah it's it's it's really interesting.

1768
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:42,540
It's and when I see your dad and how
healthy he is and how he looks so he

1769
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:45,430
again looks younger it looks thinner.

1770
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:47,620
Like it's like it's like he's all sucked
in.

1771
01:43:47,670 --> 01:43:50,470
Yeah looks like yeah.
Looks healthy.

1772
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,840
I know he looks like a different person
than the person I knew.

1773
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:55,390
And I look like a different person than
the person I knew.

1774
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:58,060
My face looks different in a good way.

1775
01:43:58,250 --> 01:44:00,700
Yeah.
Well I think there's something definite

1776
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:03,520
definitely healthy about getting a lot
of fat.

1777
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,670
Yeah.
And this is something that I think we've

1778
01:44:06,671 --> 01:44:11,671
ignored with our obsession with carbs
and one of the things that is a giant

1779
01:44:11,861 --> 01:44:16,690
benefit for people that cut the carbs
out is the way you you feel about food.

1780
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,330
Like you don't get these massive craving
my God.

1781
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:23,510
Yeah yeah.
I used to so when I used to go to eat I

1782
01:44:23,511 --> 01:44:28,310
was starving all the time I just felt
like I was starving and I'd eat and then

1783
01:44:28,311 --> 01:44:31,310
I would feel so full.
And it turns out it was bloating right.

1784
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:35,660
But I know that I just feel so full that
I would literally have to ask people to

1785
01:44:35,661 --> 01:44:39,020
take my plate away or I would keep
eating because I was starving but

1786
01:44:39,021 --> 01:44:42,830
stuffed.
And that was just my state all the time.

1787
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,680
You know it's fucked up no matter how
full I am.

1788
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:49,070
If you put a plate of french fries with
salt and in front of me I will go after

1789
01:44:49,071 --> 01:44:51,110
those bitches.
I can't help myself.

1790
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:55,580
This I'll eat one Mike is so good.
And then with some ketchup like fat

1791
01:44:55,581 --> 01:45:00,581
steak fries that are like kind of well
done ish with some salt them and ketchup

1792
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:06,070
there's just something about that trick
that biological trick that those goddamn

1793
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,160
potatoes play on you.

1794
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,810
Yeah that's.
Yeah.

1795
01:45:10,590 --> 01:45:13,590
It's kind of addictive but so addictive.
I know.

1796
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:18,620
And it turns out that even like the
amount of salad I was eating lettuce was

1797
01:45:19,411 --> 01:45:23,250
still kind of addictive because I had
like lettuce cravings lettuce cravings.

1798
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:27,240
Yeah I mean not like my apple cravings.
Not like my sugar cravings but they were

1799
01:45:27,241 --> 01:45:28,074
that they were there.

1800
01:45:28,230 --> 01:45:33,230
So when you just eat only me your body
takes that meat in through process of

1801
01:45:33,781 --> 01:45:36,470
glucose Genesis converts it to glucose
right.

1802
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:38,130
Yeah.
So I'm.

1803
01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:42,420
I haven't been out of ketosis and I'm
always in ketosis but my glucose is

1804
01:45:42,421 --> 01:45:45,010
normal that's what's weird.

1805
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:48,400
The fact that you're always in ketosis
because most people think that if you

1806
01:45:48,401 --> 01:45:49,710
eat try a protein.

1807
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:54,990
Yeah but that's the thing is if you like
convert what I'm eating to the fat ratio

1808
01:45:55,410 --> 01:45:57,580
80 percent of my calories or I'm getting
from fat.

1809
01:45:57,790 --> 01:45:59,470
Are you doing this on an app or
something.

1810
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:05,250
I'm mostly typing in the cuts and then I
can kind of add in how much tallow I'm

1811
01:46:06,461 --> 01:46:08,050
adding to lean ground beef.

1812
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:12,100
How much time do you how do you do about
tablespoon or I do it.

1813
01:46:12,490 --> 01:46:15,340
Yeah I do it kind of by tablespoon I
just scoop it in.

1814
01:46:15,550 --> 01:46:18,770
But if I if I was measuring it I'd like
four five.

1815
01:46:18,930 --> 01:46:22,960
Who do you heat the tallow up first and
then cook the beef and do it or do you

1816
01:46:22,961 --> 01:46:24,970
kind of like some older guy just mix
everything together.

1817
01:46:26,170 --> 01:46:29,530
It's way more satisfying though because
eating lean ground beef just isn't good.

1818
01:46:30,190 --> 01:46:33,340
It gets drier dry ground elk is even
worse.

1819
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:38,300
Wow.
It's delicious but it's so sinewy you

1820
01:46:38,301 --> 01:46:40,480
know.
But when I mix it with butter and stuff

1821
01:46:40,481 --> 01:46:40,750
like that.

1822
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:42,200
Yeah.
So I'm just mixing a little.

1823
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:43,143
It's great.

1824
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:45,720
All.
It's going on my voice.

1825
01:46:46,930 --> 01:46:51,930
So when you're you're looking at the
future and you know you're saying OK

1826
01:46:52,630 --> 01:46:57,630
this is going well this is you know much
better than anything I've ever done

1827
01:46:57,881 --> 01:46:59,230
before.
I feel so much better.

1828
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:01,630
Do you feel like this is the way you're
going to eat for the rest of your life.

1829
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,060
Yeah.
Do you think it's sustainable.

1830
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:08,900
Yeah
oh.

1831
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:10,550
I'm not arguing against it.

1832
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:14,000
I'm just I'm wondering sustainable in
what way nutritionally.

1833
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:16,160
Oh my God.
Yeah I think so.

1834
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:19,490
I'll keep getting my vitamins tested.
But this book that I've been reading

1835
01:47:19,491 --> 01:47:22,040
about this guy lived with anyway.
That's what they ate.

1836
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:25,340
They were healthy.
They don't have teeth that fell out like

1837
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,290
they weren't sick like were sick.

1838
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,740
The annuals are the people that went up
there anyways.

1839
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,910
Yeah but the annuals didn't evolve that
way.

1840
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,120
I mean if you stop and think about it I
mean but didn't we evolve that way too.

1841
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:37,910
I don't know.
I mean we can't say we changed like

1842
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:42,050
10000 years ago in order to eat grain.
Looks like we've evolved to hunt.

1843
01:47:42,450 --> 01:47:43,770
Kinda yeah.

1844
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:49,040
Yeah I mean but different people that
grew up in different areas of the world.

1845
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:52,370
I think they have.
I mean isn't it been proven that there's

1846
01:47:52,371 --> 01:47:56,510
different nutritional requirements that
different people have if you're you grew

1847
01:47:56,511 --> 01:47:57,410
up in different areas.

1848
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:59,430
I don't think so.
No I haven't read that.

1849
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:02,030
No
what does that.

1850
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:05,450
That diet that people.
There's there's like some.

1851
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:11,140
Some diet that they they try to
was based on bloodwork.

1852
01:48:13,350 --> 01:48:14,700
Oh the blood type diet.

1853
01:48:14,770 --> 01:48:18,030
Yeah.
The idea is that different people that

1854
01:48:18,031 --> 01:48:21,060
have different blood types that they're
coming from different parts of the

1855
01:48:21,061 --> 01:48:21,570
world.

1856
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:23,310
Yeah.
I don't know.

1857
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:27,660
I don't really look well man.
So my diet with a summary of your guide

1858
01:48:27,661 --> 01:48:29,420
to zero about diets.
I'm.

1859
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:33,780
I know Dad told me like he went over and
he said I don't think I can eat fish.

1860
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:37,710
I think fish is giving me a flare up and
my response was like well that's not

1861
01:48:37,711 --> 01:48:40,860
possible.
Feel like all I'm eating is meat and I

1862
01:48:40,861 --> 01:48:45,120
still have the same response.
And then I told you I don't eat chicken.

1863
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:49,420
Well when I switched over.
Chicken started to make me not feel

1864
01:48:49,421 --> 01:48:50,350
good.
When I was eating it.

1865
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:53,050
What about ostrich.
I haven't tried ostrich.

1866
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:56,260
I've just given up on birds ruminant
animals seem fine.

1867
01:48:56,350 --> 01:48:58,570
I tried bison bison was fine bison.

1868
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:01,270
What do what do you call it bison.

1869
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:04,860
Is that a Canadian.
I'm just gonna go with that's a Canadian

1870
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:08,330
obviously bison.
By God I hope it's the Canadians.

1871
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:10,350
Well dad says it's his fault.

1872
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:13,470
The ostrich is interesting because it's
red.

1873
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:17,280
It's a bird but it's a red meat.
That's interesting.

1874
01:49:17,370 --> 01:49:20,390
Yeah.
They have ostrich burgers at FUD

1875
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:23,220
records.
You can get an ostrich burger.

1876
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:25,700
The fucking good that ribeye the sky
bird.

1877
01:49:25,950 --> 01:49:27,930
I haven't had that.
That's a Sandhill Crane.

1878
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:31,970
Yeah Sandhill Crane is a really die guy.
That's what they call him.

1879
01:49:32,990 --> 01:49:36,210
They stay there they they hunt them and
they cook it.

1880
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:41,290
It's a really delicious lean but like
soft juicy tender red meat.

1881
01:49:44,090 --> 01:49:46,410
Huh.
Yeah well you got get a photo of it.

1882
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:49,370
Yeah look at that.
That's what looks like what.

1883
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:50,550
Yep.
Sandhill Crane.

1884
01:49:51,090 --> 01:49:54,800
Wild Canada Goose.
Where.

1885
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:57,820
I don't think we're allowed to eat that
in Canada.

1886
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:01,990
Well some some.
You're not allowed to eat some migrating

1887
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:05,800
geese right but Sandhill Crane.
I bet you could eat.

1888
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:08,710
Wow.
Wow I wonder.

1889
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:12,580
I have some buddies that hunted those in
Texas and they said they were fantastic.

1890
01:50:12,610 --> 01:50:14,560
So that's some of the best meat they've
ever eaten in their life.

1891
01:50:14,690 --> 01:50:17,350
What if you could eat that but I
wouldn't want you to eat it then get

1892
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:18,730
fucking hives and shit.

1893
01:50:18,850 --> 01:50:22,900
Yeah.
Now I may find a job for a mine for five

1894
01:50:22,901 --> 01:50:23,440
weeks.
Yeah.

1895
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:24,710
Yeah.
Diarrhea.

1896
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:26,280
Everything all over again.
Yeah.

1897
01:50:26,710 --> 01:50:30,040
So your plan is just sparkling water and
steak forever.

1898
01:50:30,430 --> 01:50:34,390
Yeah and I mean it could be more like I
could be surviving off of eggplant.

1899
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:35,890
Could be worse.
Oh yeah.

1900
01:50:36,090 --> 01:50:39,140
I enjoy everything I read all the time.
Yeah right.

1901
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:44,200
I love it and I don't get bored.
I thought if there's one thing I have to

1902
01:50:44,201 --> 01:50:47,170
eat forever I hope it's steak because
I'm not gonna get bored of steak.

1903
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:50,890
And like I said the first month was kind
of rough but then the cravings go away

1904
01:50:50,891 --> 01:50:55,891
and now it's like every meal and like
mom stay you get hate from vegan people.

1905
01:50:57,250 --> 01:51:01,360
Not really.
I don't think I'm as inflammatory as

1906
01:51:01,361 --> 01:51:04,450
some people because I can understand.
I mean if you're Italy.

1907
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:07,400
Ideology.
Ideologically possessed.

1908
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:11,110
That's different.
But if you go on a vegan diet you cut

1909
01:51:11,111 --> 01:51:12,650
out processed foods you get rid of
dairy.

1910
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:17,670
Dairy was a huge trigger for me and you
feel better than I can understand why

1911
01:51:18,971 --> 01:51:22,430
you'd be going around saying the vegan
diet is the way to eat right.

1912
01:51:22,630 --> 01:51:24,880
So I can can I can understand where
those people are coming from.

1913
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:28,960
If you're ideologically possessed and
you're saying well it's the environment

1914
01:51:28,961 --> 01:51:33,770
all this stuff I don't really care.
So no I don't get it.

1915
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:39,210
I've got like a couple of emails about
me spreading lies like well I just don't

1916
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,170
I don't really don't care.

1917
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:46,560
There's a lot of loonies out there.
What a loony people but that is the

1918
01:51:46,721 --> 01:51:51,190
issue with the the the vegan diet is
that it carries with it a moral high

1919
01:51:51,191 --> 01:51:51,760
ground.

1920
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:54,310
Yeah but other diet.
So yeah.

1921
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:56,500
That's too bad.
That part sucks.

1922
01:51:56,530 --> 01:52:00,400
The people trying to figure out their
health and going to that because it's

1923
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,830
they're trying to figure something out
that's different.

1924
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:06,390
Like the whole moral thing like just let
it go.

1925
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:09,990
Well listen I think this is very
interesting stuff.

1926
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:15,080
You know I don't have your health issues
and I think very few people do.

1927
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:20,640
But obviously for you it's it's made
some massive impact at home and for your

1928
01:52:20,641 --> 01:52:21,540
father as well.

1929
01:52:21,570 --> 01:52:25,150
I mean it's really
it's very very interesting.

1930
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:27,760
And like I said my friend lives in San
Diego.

1931
01:52:28,270 --> 01:52:30,370
No problems.
I mean he's he's loving it.

1932
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:33,510
I know several other people that have
jumped on board as well too and they're

1933
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:35,110
seeing big benefits from them.

1934
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:39,340
I mean it's almost enough to make me
want to try it but you should try.

1935
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:43,300
Well the problem doesn't take long.
But I I have hundreds of pounds of wild

1936
01:52:43,301 --> 01:52:45,020
game meat.
That's perfect.

1937
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:46,900
Yeah.
But I have to eat it with fat and have

1938
01:52:46,901 --> 01:52:48,310
to figure out a way to get fat into it.

1939
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:50,260
You can order towel here.
Mm hmm.

1940
01:52:50,410 --> 01:52:51,280
Yeah.
This order towel.

1941
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:54,550
It's on it like I haven't I've talked to
people like programmers in Silicon

1942
01:52:54,551 --> 01:52:57,280
Valley who've Skype me and they're
healthy and they just want to be more

1943
01:52:57,281 --> 01:53:02,281
productive and the cognitive benefits it
takes like six weeks and it's worth just

1944
01:53:02,351 --> 01:53:05,740
seeing what it's like but they get that
just from the ketogenic diet.

1945
01:53:05,890 --> 01:53:08,110
No.
I've had people switch off of the

1946
01:53:08,111 --> 01:53:10,990
ketogenic.
There's there's something here there's

1947
01:53:10,991 --> 01:53:13,160
really something here and it's worth are
you seeing.

1948
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:16,570
No I think people would see benefits if
they tried it.

1949
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:17,620
Even healthy people.

1950
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,990
What do you think those benefits are
coming from.

1951
01:53:22,030 --> 01:53:26,260
I don't know.
I don't know if microbiome switch or if

1952
01:53:26,710 --> 01:53:31,330
there's less you're just ingesting less
plant toxin or if it's a toxin.

1953
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:35,950
What do you mean by the wild plants have
like naturally occurring toxins

1954
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:39,460
depending on the plant to get bugs and
things to stop eating them.

1955
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:44,850
That's just their defense mechanism.
So like oscillates that's a big one

1956
01:53:45,070 --> 01:53:49,630
lecterns like all those types of things
are inflammatory and it just seemed like

1957
01:53:49,631 --> 01:53:53,230
we've just found the plants that we can
tolerate as humans we found the plants

1958
01:53:53,231 --> 01:53:56,590
we can tolerate the easiest and don't
kill us and we eat those and we've bred

1959
01:53:56,591 --> 01:54:01,510
them so that they're easier to eat but
so maybe removing those from the diet

1960
01:54:01,511 --> 01:54:04,350
seems to help people.
But it seems like giving it a six week

1961
01:54:04,390 --> 01:54:07,980
try
I don't see a downside.

1962
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:11,730
Again I've only I haven't seen anybody
switch back.

1963
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:13,740
Really.
Mm hmm.

1964
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:18,630
And I've been talking to a lot of people
on Skype over like periods of months and

1965
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:21,300
I haven't seen anyone switch back
including the healthy people.

1966
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:22,613
All right.

1967
01:54:23,010 --> 01:54:26,310
Well I'm curious this conversation's
evolving.

1968
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,520
That's for sure.
And you know it's evolving with many

1969
01:54:29,521 --> 01:54:33,180
many people all across the country.
And you know when you take out the

1970
01:54:33,690 --> 01:54:38,690
ideological or the moral high ground
argument that vegetarians have it's it's

1971
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:42,480
it's interesting to me at the very least
is interesting.

1972
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:48,030
Yeah something going on.
So if people want to check out your blog

1973
01:54:48,410 --> 01:54:49,320
what would that be.

1974
01:54:49,540 --> 01:54:51,980
Well that's McKayla Peterson dot com
spell.

1975
01:54:52,690 --> 01:54:56,090
Am I k h a I L.A..
All right.

1976
01:54:56,130 --> 01:55:01,130
Peterson dot com dot com.
And is there another name for it isn't

1977
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:02,290
it.
Don't eat that.

1978
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:05,140
Don't eat that.
If you go to don't eat that dot is that

1979
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:06,900
it.
No I don't have that somebody has bought

1980
01:55:06,901 --> 01:55:10,220
it or are trying to sell it back to me
for a lot fuckers.

1981
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:13,230
Now these fuckers.
Thank you.

1982
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:14,880
Thank you Carl.
Thanks for having me.

1983
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:16,470
Yeah.
Good bye everybody.
