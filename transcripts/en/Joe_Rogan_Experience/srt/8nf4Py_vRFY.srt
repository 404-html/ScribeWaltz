1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,580
The joe rogan experience sands process.

2
00:00:02,581 --> 00:00:05,040
Awkward moment ever is when
they see like in Vegas,

3
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:08,310
about five dudes hanging out together
and there's no girls near him.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,490
And then they're getting a couple of
drinks in them and they start sorta like

5
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:14,460
half dance and they can't like
totally commit to dancing,

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,151
you know,

7
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:17,910
so like little go through
like half the moves.

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,980
Like I'm not really an
advocate of this music.

9
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,660
It doesn't make me move that much.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,440
But you know,

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,400
I'll give a little move,

12
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,800
we'll get up a little move here and there,

13
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:25,050
you know,

14
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,520
but they can't like dance with each other.

15
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,740
They can only move just a minimal amount.

16
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,910
You can't get crazy

17
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,820
gyrating hips.

18
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,520
This is a,

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,660
you're not allowed to do that to dude's
girls can get together and dance all

20
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,140
they want.

21
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,150
But with dudes you can
only sort of half dance.

22
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:39,991
I said,

23
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:40,191
God,

24
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:41,190
just by myself.

25
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,030
Yeah,

26
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,421
sometimes.

27
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:44,520
Sometimes you should go
out by yourself to clubs.

28
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,390
Um,

29
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,850
when I first moved to La I did,

30
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,200
but I would go on the
dance floor by myself.

31
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:49,711
Oh my God,

32
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:50,760
there's something wrong with your brain.

33
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:51,720
You need to go to a doctor

34
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,163
first.

35
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,270
It's a little bad at first you didn't
get to get the guys that are like,

36
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:57,660
look,

37
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,500
what's this guy doing?

38
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,433
You kind of do it,

39
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,000
but then you get the girls that come over
to you because they liked the guy who,

40
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,220
who's then we've done a lot of work.

41
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:05,461
Yeah.

42
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:06,320
It's a little gutsy.

43
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,460
It was a very gutsy move.

44
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:08,791
Got You.

45
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,080
Moved.

46
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,310
Not,

47
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,350
not always worked.

48
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,730
How many times is it failed on you?

49
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:12,331
Oh,

50
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:12,841
I don't even know.

51
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,670
Probably more times than but that,

52
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,380
but it just takes that one time.

53
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,580
You know?

54
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,660
Just that one time.

55
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,220
Some dudes can take criticism
and rejection rather.

56
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,810
Some dudes are fine with that.

57
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,830
I have a friend,

58
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,310
he would,

59
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,800
he would hit on every girl
that he was an ugly guy.

60
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,510
It was.

61
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,343
I was fat,

62
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,440
but he didn't give a fuck.

63
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,520
He would swing.

64
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,960
He would swing at every pitch.

65
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,830
I know a couple of Evernote that
way that I know that he's a comic.

66
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,590
I don't want to give him up on the air.

67
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,070
I've owned you.

68
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,491
Do you mind?

69
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:41,701
Either,

70
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:46,270
but you can't go to bars with that
guy because it's too much to my,

71
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,350
and then those are always the guys
who let people know you're a comic.

72
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,110
Like there's a whole bunch
of comics that are that way.

73
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,330
So they go up to the boundary like,

74
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:53,820
Hey,

75
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,990
we're the comics had to chuckle,

76
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:55,231
hut.

77
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,760
And then the bonds are usually like,

78
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,840
I don't care

79
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,210
what you want,

80
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,730
free tickets or the want
the girls to be impressed.

81
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,180
It's bad.

82
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,200
It's brutal when you were,

83
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:04,771
the dude will,

84
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:05,221
you know,

85
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,180
there's no way.

86
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:09,300
If you go somewhere and there's a chick
that he's not going to hit on her and

87
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:11,790
it's not going to get annoying and
it's not going to get embarrassing.

88
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,120
Yeah,

89
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,440
those guys are brutal.

90
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,371
Or you know,

91
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:14,701
it's like,

92
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,061
okay,

93
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:18,540
I can't hang out with you anymore
because if I hang out with you and we go

94
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,140
somewhere,

95
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,700
you look and immediately just everything
that moves the first fucking the

96
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:24,570
waitress comes over.

97
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:25,111
I think she's kind of,

98
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:25,501
Oh man,

99
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:25,801
look at that.

100
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:26,700
And just talking to him.

101
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,890
And then next thing you know all,

102
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:31,260
it's all about this fucking
waitress and him getting this,

103
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:32,011
which was his number.

104
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:32,580
I'm like,

105
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,081
Whoa,

106
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:33,451
I can't,

107
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,470
you just have lunch,

108
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,760
fucking Weirdo.

109
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,370
And then they don't come to your table
anymore cause they don't want to deal

110
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:38,940
with Ya.

111
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,211
And then,

112
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:40,044
yeah,

113
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,920
exactly.

114
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,250
And it,

115
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,500
cause it works every 30th time.

116
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,510
They fucking just want
to put in those numbers,

117
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:45,751
man.

118
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:45,990
Yeah.

119
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,890
Those crazy dudes,

120
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:49,770
they just want to put in those numbers
and if you're around them and be like,

121
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:50,604
oh great,

122
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:50,860
no,

123
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,670
that's a person.

124
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,200
Yeah,

125
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,580
it's fucking disastrous,

126
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:53,791
man.

127
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,630
It's a shitty feeling.

128
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,830
I would add,

129
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,663
well they either move,

130
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,900
when I was on by myself,

131
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,010
I would go up to girls and say,

132
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,610
my friends left me,

133
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,170
can I dance by you?

134
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:04,360
So I don't look like
I'm dancing by myself.

135
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,250
Then you dance.

136
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:06,671
But here's,

137
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:07,391
here's the trick,

138
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:07,931
young guys,

139
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:08,764
here's the thing.

140
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,400
You have to commit to that and
you don't talk to those girls.

141
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,241
You don't go,

142
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:14,680
can I Bebo and then,

143
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:14,921
hey,

144
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:15,611
what's up ladies?

145
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,840
Then you ignore them.

146
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,200
Ooh,

147
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,920
okay.

148
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,480
And then the cooler,

149
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,580
one of the group will then
kind of come over and go,

150
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:22,390
you can then,

151
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,570
then they'll let you into the circle
if you're not completely hideous in and

152
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,250
embarrassing them.

153
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:26,710
Key is,

154
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,910
is not to give him attention.

155
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,290
After you do that little move.

156
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,160
Wow,

157
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,830
and then now you're the
hurt animal in the forest.

158
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,280
You're the bird with a broken wing and
there'd be one nurturing girl in that

159
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,300
group that will bring you in.

160
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,451
I just go up to him and go,

161
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:39,601
Hey,

162
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:40,580
I'm a producer like her

163
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,493
moves.

164
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:42,721
Ladies.

165
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:46,710
I just want you to just stop and think
about how fucking gross and Maryland have

166
00:03:46,711 --> 00:03:47,970
you heard of Tang brothers?

167
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:48,631
I started,

168
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:52,410
I stopped for a second and think of
how gross men are and how fucking,

169
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,550
how much effort you put into creating
the perfect environment where they think

244
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,360
The first thing I said to her,

245
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,690
she was playing with her iPod
and we're all out to dinner.

246
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,351
And I go,

247
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:50,621

248
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:53,080

00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,411

250
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:54,610

251
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:54,911

00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:57,831

256
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:58,101

258
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,750

259
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,231

260
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:00,561

261
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,670

264
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,930

268
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,130

269
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:13,940

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,700
