1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,960
Four three,

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,123
two,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,940
one style band.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,740
Ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,573
Salute sir.

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,810
Congratulations man.

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,480
Thank you.

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,730
Thank you.

9
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,640
You fight your fight.

10
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,870
Friday night was um,

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,620
that was what you would call like
a coming out party in America.

12
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,001
In America.

13
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:20,431
America.

14
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:21,030
Yeah.

15
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,863
People got to see

16
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,340
first fight in Vegas,

17
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,510
first main event,

18
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,610
a first top 10 guy.

19
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,260
And I feel like I got to kind of like
shut a lot of people up because before

20
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:31,860
that fight,

21
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,850
a lot of people kind of like,

22
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:33,841
shit,

23
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:34,441
it's too much.

24
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:35,131
It's too soon.

25
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:35,964
Like the hype.

26
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,400
Yeah.

27
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:36,711
He's like,

28
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:37,740
oh he's this and that.

29
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:38,970
And for me,

30
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,220
I wouldn't take salt to
it cause they don't know.

31
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,611
You know,

32
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:42,444
you can't,

33
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,230
um,

34
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,220
you can't fault them for it.

35
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:44,890
So.

36
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,071
Well,

37
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:47,140
you did a smart thing in
the way you handled your,

38
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:48,670
your transition to MMA too.

39
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:48,941
I mean,

40
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:49,540
you really,

41
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,040
you really took your
time and did it right.

42
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,740
You and I talked for the
first time about this,

43
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:54,574
how many years ago?

44
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,860
2015 I think you hit me
up on Instagram and said,

45
00:00:58,861 --> 00:00:59,370
you know,

46
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,720
when am I going to call
one of your fights?

47
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,371
And I was like yeah,

48
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:03,150
we'll take our time.

49
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,050
Cause he's my coach.

50
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,760
He's the mastermind behind all this.

51
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,860
Eugene Bearman without him,

52
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,270
my career will be in the shitter.

53
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,030
So he kinda let just take out time.

54
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,960
There's no rush.

55
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,160
Smart way on 100% cause you see like
looking for a fight guys like example sage

56
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:21,810
Northcutt he's being up and down in the
UFC fighting or like his rise and stuff

57
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:22,171
like that.

58
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:22,831
But you have to,

59
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:25,740
you can't just come in here with like
maybe three fights on let's maybe like a

60
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:30,741
Micky gall who also has extensive
background in something else like Jujitsu.

61
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,490
But yeah I took my time for the round
the world for different body types,

62
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:36,480
different styles.

63
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,480
And then eventually I
think that UFC would like,

64
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:39,840
okay,

65
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,570
what do you want?

66
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,403
Come on,

67
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,623
let's go.

68
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,220
You built up a lot of hype outside.

69
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:46,930
You built up some hype kickboxing,

70
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:49,720
you built up some hype and MMA but
you built up a lot of internet hype.

71
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,270
There was a lot of highlight videos
made to you and people are like,

72
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,051
Oh shit,

73
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:53,884
look at this guy.

74
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,370
And then dudes were breaking down your,

75
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,210
your videos like breaking down technique.

76
00:01:58,211 --> 00:01:59,440
Like look how he sets this up.

77
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,910
There was one that was it,

78
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:01,691
Brendan Dorman,

79
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:02,650
who did it recently?

80
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,560
Was it a Lawrence Ken Chenault?

81
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,620
Maybe it was Brendan Doormen.

82
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,790
The Solara yesterday.

83
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,181
Yeah,

84
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:08,014
Brendan Doorman.

85
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,350
He did one where you sat that
dude up and then left high,

86
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:12,184
kicked him.

87
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:12,941
Uh Oh no,

88
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:16,870
that was a lot of attention
to those guys are so important

89
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,060
about that kick.

90
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,900
We're drilling it.

91
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,280
I hate you didn't taught it to me,

92
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:22,080
that setup probably seven days before.

93
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,150
And he said if this lands is the finisher,

94
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,120
he said that why whatever.

95
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,550
And then in the fight something happened
and I didn't even think about it.

96
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:32,460
Just boom and Atlanta and
I hurt my foot on his head.

97
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,790
Actually I actually hurt me cause
I was a third fight of the night.

98
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,760
So it was a tournament to the final flight
and I hurt my foot in his hand and I

99
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:41,340
was like okay cause you kind
of see me limping a little bit.

100
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:42,600
Then I went in on him and just,

101
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,010
yeah I finished it off.

102
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,890
That was a beautiful high tech man.

103
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,691
The way he set it up.

104
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:50,800
It's so interesting too because you forced
him into this weird battle of erratic

105
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:51,910
movement like you,

106
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,320
you did a lot of this with them.

107
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,610
You got to take care of this first.

108
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:56,710
A lot of guys think
like what's for a hobby?

109
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:57,400
Well he said,

110
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,880
yeah,

111
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,511
take care of this.

112
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,160
Scramble your to it for Asa.

113
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,551
Hobbies,

114
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:01,220
a treasure.

115
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,840
100%.

116
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,590
He's a treasure.

117
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,530
I liked the way he thinks and then
listen to that podcast and yeah,

118
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,060
when he said that I
was like that's what I,

119
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:07,870
that's what we do.

120
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,360
I like to make these guys
second guess themselves.

121
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:11,630
Like just get stuck.

122
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,000
Locate.

123
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,833
He's right here.

124
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,471
Like fuck,

125
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:14,380
I've got to reset right here.

126
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:14,591
Okay,

127
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:14,771
cool.

128
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:15,604
Cool.

129
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,000
Just called Jab and then they just get
flustered and they can talk all this

130
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:19,280
stuff.

131
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,740
All we're going to do
this and this and that.

132
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:20,921
Right.

133
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:23,050
And it's different when you see it on TV,

134
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,973
but when you're in,

135
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,090
cause I've had it done to me.

136
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:26,950
I've got teammates that
do it to me all the time.

137
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:27,701
If I'm not on my game,

138
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:28,191
they do it to me.

139
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:29,024
And I'm like,

140
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,310
so this is what it feels like.

141
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,470
I don't want to be on
the other side of that.

142
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,390
So if you come in overtrain yeah,

143
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,343
or just say,

144
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:35,790
Hey,

145
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,810
my day like that Volcker
would catch me on some days.

146
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:38,860
Dan Oak is a beast,

147
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,251
my guy,

148
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:41,440
but he's,

149
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,480
it's been like out of three weeks.

150
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,460
Shane young in Singapore,

151
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,241
uh,

152
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:46,930
myself,

153
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,820
Friday night and Dan Hook her on Saturday.

154
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,360
Dan hookers,

155
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,990
one of them never,

156
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,630
never celebrated in the octagon guy.

157
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,050
He's all,

158
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,340
and even that called them,

159
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,080
I called them Fujita remembering,

160
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,090
was it two one night he looked at you,

161
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,380
he told me it didn't mean to,

162
00:03:59,381 --> 00:03:59,750
but it looked at,

163
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,310
he was like,

164
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,420
do you know who I am now?

165
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,770
And through his mouth guard at the cage,

166
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:05,080
but he said it went through the cage
and hit her in the chest or something.

167
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,220
It was,

168
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,740
yeah,

169
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,040
it was.

170
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,410
I am now because I knew who he was.

171
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,071
Of course you did,

172
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:09,351
but like,

173
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:11,260
it's kind of like the
UFC wasn't really like,

174
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,950
you know,

175
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,640
putting them out there.

176
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,900
They kind of like your sleeping on him.

177
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:14,620
So he just,

178
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,640
he felt frustrated.

179
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,463
Yeah.

180
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,850
That's just cause he's so ambitious.

181
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,121
Yeah,

182
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:21,310
100% I don't have men handle with that.

183
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:21,521
Yeah,

184
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:21,941
of course.

185
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:22,900
I know third party,

186
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:25,060
but all I had him go down and call fights.

187
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,923
Me and him go at it.

188
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,321
Me,

189
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:26,891
Carlos,

190
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,161
me,

191
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:27,911
John Vaccae,

192
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:28,630
Bj plan.

193
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,730
Like so many people don't know yet.

194
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:33,440
I've told them like
when Kay Warren was the,

195
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:33,621
the,

196
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:34,900
the pinnacle of Combat Sports,

197
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:35,734
right?

198
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,630
New Zealand Australasia was on top of,

199
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:38,830
you had raised that from Mark Hunt,

200
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,470
Doug Viney,

201
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,940
Jason Weimar more Jordan and guys from
that side of the world like running,

202
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,430
like running it and other
sides of the words as well.

203
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:48,970
But I felt like we fell off and then New
Zealand coming back and forth kind of

204
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:50,890
took a little law for a few years,

205
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,724
a long time.

206
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,050
And now it's,

207
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,330
we're doing it again like guys like me,

208
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,691
Dan,

209
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:56,650
Shane Chi.

210
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,830
We're about to like take it to
the next level and then bring,

211
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,960
bring ends at sports again all the way up.

212
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,141
Well,

213
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:05,560
you know what's interesting is
that New Zealand in particular,

214
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,910
like you guys,

215
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,690
there's,

216
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,950
there's something about having you guys
come over here and there's not like a

217
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:13,960
long history where people think of,

218
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,491
you know,

219
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:16,390
like zoo New Zealand MMA fighters,

220
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:20,860
but New Zealand kickboxers I mean it's
one of the most rich environments,

221
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:24,430
like think about all the different high
level kickboxers that came out of New

222
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,630
Zealand or Australia for that matter.

223
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,700
Australasia and general crazy,

224
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,640
crazy number of like really
high level kickboxers.

225
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,500
Like when I came to help a rumble,

226
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,400
uh,

227
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,950
with his camp for Jon Jones because I,

228
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,370
Rashad linked it up and said,

229
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,181
you should come help us out.

230
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:37,451
And I said,

231
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:37,690
yeah,

232
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,410
sure.

233
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,210
So it's a black ceilings
when it was still around.

234
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,760
And I was surprised,

235
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,211
I was like,

236
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:43,920
man,

237
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,380
a standup in America is not,

238
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,960
not even close on.

239
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,920
I love the grappling,

240
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,521
the wrestling,

241
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:51,040
cause you guys are having in schools
and other presidents come here and open

242
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:51,940
schools and stuff like that.

243
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:54,280
But the standup was not on our level.

244
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:55,660
So I told Eugene that and he's like,

245
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:55,930
good,

246
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,930
I wanted you to know that because had
the same thing when he went to Vegas and

247
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:00,501
then he saw like,

248
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:00,920
man,

249
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,580
these guys,

250
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,000
their standups not really on our level.

251
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,820
So we've always had that.

252
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,600
Um,

253
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,560
I don't know where it comes from.

254
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:07,940
These like a whole lineage of it.

255
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:08,360
They've been raised.

256
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,601
Sephora,

257
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,590
we come from the same school.

258
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,051
Sure.

259
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:10,210
Yeah.

260
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:10,881
Blg School.

261
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,230
But yeah,

262
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,250
a grappling and stuff.

263
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,580
I feel like we were
behind that first because,

264
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,010
you know,

265
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,843
Internet,

266
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,270
uh,

267
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,290
we get seminars and shit like that and
I've got obsessive trainers like Adam

268
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:21,291
Johnson,

269
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:21,651
he's a,

270
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:25,070
he's my Jujitsu coach in a
way and he's just obsessed.

271
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,450
So they constantly like
upgrading everything.

272
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:29,720
And I think it went from,

273
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,240
I didn't really get to use my Jujitsu
much a little bit in that fight,

274
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:32,660
but he,

275
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,740
the take down defense,

276
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,060
that's all Andre as well,

277
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,811
my wrestling coach,

278
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:36,644
he's a Romanian guy,

279
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,753
so we're,

280
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,310
we don't need to like go anywhere else.

281
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,171
I felt like we've,

282
00:06:41,171 --> 00:06:41,401
we've,

283
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,560
we've got people where we are with
stacked enough to be able to level up and

284
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,580
compete with the rest of the world.

285
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,600
You've got someone like Dan Hooker in
your camp just out of luck when you have

286
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:52,220
guys like you and him together.

287
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,150
That's what forces everybody to the
next level and everyone's in town do,

288
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,120
you will rise up to,

289
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:57,290
they'll see what you're doing.

290
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,880
They'll see your fight with Tavarez,

291
00:06:58,881 --> 00:06:59,320
the CCM,

292
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,960
your fights online.

293
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,560
You'll see you in the gym and you when
you have a guy like that in the gym,

294
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:06,020
I've always experienced this
in Jujitsu and everything else.

295
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,720
Everybody else's level rises up to try
to catch up to that guy percent because

296
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,030
all they see like you guys are at what
the world sees is just us on TV and then

297
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:15,230
they see like the highlights,

298
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:15,861
the cool stuff.

299
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:18,470
But my teammates get to see
me fuck up all the time.

300
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,240
They see me get my licks of course.

301
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,290
So when they see all that stuff,

302
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,780
then they see me on the world
stage kicking ass and like,

303
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:24,140
man,

304
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,220
of course I can do,

305
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:25,761
it's like Brad,

306
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:29,060
Brad Riddell bad as
kickbox a world champion,

307
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:31,220
one of my teammates or angry panda.

308
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,060
But he's,

309
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,421
yeah,

310
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:32,790
he's moving,

311
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,860
making this move to MMA now,

312
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:34,640
right now.

313
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:34,851
But,

314
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:35,001
um,

315
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:35,570
he's,

316
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,980
he's another one of those guys that he
kickbox and doesn't really do it for him.

317
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:40,880
He's,

318
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,910
he's like built like a
Chad Mendez type guy,

319
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:44,241
short,

320
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:45,074
stocky,

321
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,890
pretty thick.

322
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,450
And he could wrestle,

323
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,751
you know,

324
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:48,710
but no one knows it yet.

325
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:51,290
So whenever he comes into MMA or UFC,

326
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,130
then everyone's going to be like,

327
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:52,731
it would take him down.

328
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:53,600
Let's see what can happen.

329
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,770
But yeah,

330
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,100
they have,

331
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,680
they find out eventually if there's guys
from that section of the world and when

332
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:04,681
you really stop and think about between
now between New Zealand and Australia,

333
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,260
how many worldclass kickboxers Holy Shit.

334
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:09,990
A lot.

335
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,340
Yeah.

336
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,060
And they've run through,

337
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,360
not just from this Arab,

338
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:13,400
but even back in the day.

339
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:13,761
Right.

340
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:14,570
But Dennis,

341
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:14,571
Alexia,

342
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:14,781
right.

343
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:18,530
It wasn't right for me with
kickboxing from Hawaii.

344
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:18,921
I know,

345
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:19,401
I know.

346
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:19,821
I know,

347
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:20,420
um,

348
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,510
like say up to ray,

349
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,760
Seth was days like my comp.

350
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:24,830
I never really invested
in k one back in the day.

351
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,950
I just got to think it guy.

352
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,320
I think Stan longe Anitas was
from Australia by not like this.

353
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,150
There's a deep rooted history and
kickboxing and Australia and that kind of

354
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:35,630
stuff.

355
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:35,961
Why,

356
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:36,794
what happened there?

357
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,700
How'd that get started?

358
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:38,060
Yeah,

359
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,541
that's a great,

360
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,460
I could sit there if you
want to speak to someone,

361
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:44,030
usually would be the guy or
told you they're the guys
that have the history just

362
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,750
up here.

363
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,380
But for me I just came in and I
enjoyed it and I jumped in the pool.

364
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,060
Well from the United States you have,

365
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,970
there are some big kickbox camps,

366
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,580
but also you get a lot of guys who've
come here from Holland and from other

367
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:59,950
kickboxing rich places
and to removed right now.

368
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,331
Sure,

369
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:00,631
sure,

370
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:01,170
sure.

371
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,550
And of course guys who fought over there
and came over here like Alister and

372
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,570
guys who entered into MMA.

373
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:07,350
It's just,

374
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,580
it is interesting that,

375
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,390
you know,

376
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,230
for MMA gyms there's like a certain
level of striking and then you see like a

377
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:16,740
Nicky hold skin will come and start
training with those guys and you realize

378
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,630
like I was watching it.

379
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,781
Yeah.

380
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:19,600
A little bit of the spine.

381
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,310
He's good.

382
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,121
What's happening to him now?

383
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:21,990
Obviously I'm in a while.

384
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,000
I think he's boxing now.

385
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:24,781
Yeah,

386
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:25,614
I think,

387
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,281
yeah,

388
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:29,650
I think he's decided that there's
more money in boxing and um,

389
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:29,850
you know,

390
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,260
he's winning some hands as well.

391
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,020
He does got a nasty left hook body route.

392
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:34,681
Yeah.

393
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:35,221
Like a stop.

394
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:35,290
Well,

395
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,530
I think kickbox and like
if I wanted to take the,

396
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,990
the boxing blueprint,

397
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:42,300
I could have done that because
I'm six and one in boxing as well.

398
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,480
So I could have done that and
just got built up quite like,

399
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:45,721
you know,

400
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,850
the cans fight,

401
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:48,451
some champions,

402
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:49,261
local champions,

403
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,540
some national champions and
eventually on the world stage.

404
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,550
But for me it just,

405
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,100
I never wanted to feel vulnerable.

406
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,760
I never wanted to feel like another guy
could kick my ass into another dislike.

407
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:00,750
You know Floyd Mayweather,

408
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,530
they about to do this fight with McGregor
part too and they had all these stupid

409
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:04,981
rules like,

410
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:05,190
okay.

411
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,451
No,

412
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:06,450
I think that was all fake.

413
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:06,691
Yeah,

414
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:06,901
I know.

415
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:08,670
But like even the idea of it,

416
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:08,971
I'm like,

417
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:09,661
if you're going to do it,

418
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:10,494
just jump in.

419
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,431
What do we do is okay,

420
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:11,730
what you,

421
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,540
you're a man like,

422
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:12,751
Yo,

423
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:13,111
fuck you.

424
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:14,130
We're going to do it man to man.

425
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,041
But no kicks.

426
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:15,691
Don't know kicks.

427
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:15,821
Don't,

428
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:16,290
no,

429
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:16,980
no knees,

430
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,910
no elbows.

431
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,980
And I had that like,

432
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:19,770
it's just,

433
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,700
I don't understand.

434
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:21,031
I'm like,

435
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:21,864
why?

436
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,670
If you want to prove
you're the best fighter,

437
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,470
you have to fight people from other codes.

438
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,630
And this is at the UFC.

439
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:28,500
That's the highest level,

440
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,281
you know.

441
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:33,320
So I entered into any wrestling
competition or Jujitsu
graffiting competition.

442
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,350
I have place I,

443
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:36,184
let me see.

444
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,570
Yes,

445
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:36,990
a mission.

446
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,321
I never,

447
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:38,160
I've never been first,

448
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:39,150
but I'm like either second,

449
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,481
third,

450
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,010
or somewhere else.

451
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:41,640
But yeah,

452
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,770
I believe it done maybe
four or five of my career.

453
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
You have a specialty and I,

454
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:47,880
I've always felt like
guys who have a specialty,

455
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,600
if they can get to a certain amount
of good at this other thing without

456
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:53,820
abandoning their skills as a specialty,

457
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,590
are we going to have that giant advantage?

458
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,011
I agree.

459
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:58,020
And that's just the same thing.

460
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,290
Whatever got them to what they're
good at and they say boxing,

461
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:01,711
wrestling,

462
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:02,544
they can do the same thing.

463
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,800
Gary Tonin was a fight.

464
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:05,160
He um,

465
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,630
he had a one FC or one championship and
not the guy with the one too that wasn't

466
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:10,590
a Jujitsu stopped punch.

467
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,970
That wasn't like a amateur,

468
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,000
like a guy who's never strike a strike
before he actually looked like he was

469
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,250
flowing well with a stand
up and that's cause he,

470
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,200
same thing happens in Jujitsu or whatever,

471
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,800
you know,

472
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,111
whatever.

473
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:23,250
It made them great at grappling can
make them great at standup as well.

474
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,551
Yeah,

475
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:24,151
for sure.

476
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:28,140
I mean obviously there's the added element
of getting hit that some people can't

477
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:29,640
psychologically handle as well.

478
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,810
We know that was,

479
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,220
yeah,

480
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,053
it makes a big difference.

481
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,580
I used to be but then event like
not if my watch my fight after I,

482
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,250
after it happened,

483
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,083
I look,

484
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,000
I keep looking at what's happening.

485
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:39,270
I'm,

486
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,350
I'm searching for people,

487
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,090
I'm searching for shots or whatever,

488
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:45,040
but a lot of people kind
of like either flare,

489
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:45,720
um,

490
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,040
close up or they not turn away but like
they just try to use the wall and you

491
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,290
can't really use that in
an MMA because the gloves,

492
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,440
they don't help but in kickbox and you
can just like I saw you were there and

493
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:58,990
numb la when I fought them
for the glory world title.

494
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,500
Yes.

495
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,311
That kind of style.

496
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:04,360
Like you can just jog and not down
and beat the legs or whatever.

497
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,291
Exactly.

498
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,124
A big gloves.

499
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,870
You can still find your ways around them.

500
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:08,930
And they made this,

501
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,480
the ring was probably,

502
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,250
if you put three of these tables together,

503
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:12,791
that was the ring.

504
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,820
It was a smaller group you in.

505
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,430
I cry,

506
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,091
I cracked the code.

507
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:17,740
I was able to get my
foot work around them.

508
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,920
Even this cage was big enough
for people and that was the case.

509
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:20,230
Smaller.

510
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,441
I was like,

511
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:20,710
yeah,

512
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,610
but it was big enough for me to think
about that palms cage that I really like

513
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,420
is I feel,

514
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,160
it feels like it's the right size.

515
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,083
I feel like the set up,

516
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,360
I feel like the you regular
UFC cage is big and I liked it.

517
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:31,781
It's big,

518
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:33,040
but it might be too big.

519
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,710
Don't need to be made from,

520
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,250
it was,

521
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,640
it was small but it wasn't like,

522
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,181
oh my God.

523
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:37,421
Yeah,

524
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:38,254
like on the phone before.

525
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,410
I mean it looked like he had massive
Matt a lot better than the kickboxing,

526
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:41,591
right?

527
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:42,080
Yeah,

528
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,030
I was thinking about that.

529
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,490
It's very rare you get a boxing ring that
has anywhere near the kind of distance

530
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,560
from corner to corner.

531
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,360
Yeah.

532
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,193
Do you a good,

533
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,080
but the UFC,

534
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:50,321
there's,

535
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,270
there's some pros and cons I think,

536
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,160
but it's a con when it's a fight
like in Ghana versus Derek,

537
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,750
that's when it's a Chi.

538
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,030
Have a video of me before that fight,

539
00:12:58,031 --> 00:12:58,571
like he's yelling.

540
00:12:58,571 --> 00:12:59,900
Somebody got to die,

541
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,390
dude come and they find it.

542
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,420
When I saw Francis wait two 53 I was like,

543
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,620
oh shit.

544
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,790
He's normally jacked.

545
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,520
He looks at it.

546
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:11,920
He looked,

547
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,780
he looked like he took
it very fucking serious.

548
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,300
I thought he was going to
realize that he got out,

549
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:19,630
wrestled and now conditioned he's going
to come back guns blazing and tried to

550
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,040
put a beating on Derrick Lewis.

551
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,750
But he was so tentative,

552
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,310
even with a fight like Stephen Wonderboy
Thompson and I'm there until that five

553
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:27,701
people were like,

554
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:28,041
it was born.

555
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:28,720
And I was like,

556
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,201
hell no.

557
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:30,520
Like I enjoy that fight.

558
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,240
It was just small margin for
error to standup guys who,

559
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:34,871
you know,

560
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:37,480
you can understand the game where
it's like the foot placement,

561
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:37,980
you know,

562
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,451
faints,

563
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,284
all that kind of shit.

564
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,230
And then people were like,

565
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,921
that sucked.

566
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,191
I was like,

567
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:43,024
well you don't understand,

568
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,511
you know,

569
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:44,440
striking on that level.

570
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,750
But that Derrick Lewis
flight and for instance,

571
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:49,300
it was like I tried and
just of it was just,

572
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:49,990
yeah,

573
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,710
it was gone.

574
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,000
It was the number two least amount of
strikes when ever in a three round fight.

575
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,190
And they're both beasts.

576
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:57,610
They both,

577
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,630
I know like motherfuckers,

578
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,050
boy,

579
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,460
they both been in crazy fights.

580
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:02,860
Like they both been in
nothing but exciting fights.

581
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,693
Yeah,

582
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,990
except for you know,

583
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,400
some brief moments.

584
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,640
So it's just a
psychological issue I guess.

585
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,390
Who knows the same.

586
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,140
They said it was too,

587
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,501
like he,

588
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:14,470
if he had like a PTSD from his last fight,

589
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:14,860
like shit,

590
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,440
I didn't want to like get
hurt again or whatever.

591
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,630
But he took a beating in
that last fight as well.

592
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,580
He did.

593
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,840
People don't realize he did.

594
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,210
He got fucked up and
that fight five rounds.

595
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,810
What people don't see is how he
felt after it's six hours later,

596
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:29,650
10 hours later,

597
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,180
24 hours later when his head's pounding.

598
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,920
Headaches got to close
all the drapes and yeah,

599
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,783
no light.

600
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,410
It's alive,

601
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:38,680
Huh?

602
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:38,921
Yeah.

603
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:39,820
I may want to be a fighter.

604
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,280
He's only been doing it for five years.

605
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,240
That's what's really crazy.

606
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:44,021
And that's the thing,

607
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:45,670
cause he's just looked at him.

608
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,870
I'm the runt of my people.

609
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,070
You go to Nigeria,

610
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,680
there's literally picks of the
litter when I went back there,

611
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,290
I'm like,

612
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,430
should not be playing football.

613
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,623
Big money in it.

614
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:58,630
But I think like MMA as like you can
just grab any of those kids and give him

615
00:14:58,821 --> 00:14:59,654
some boxing gloves.

616
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,910
Showed him how to sprawl show
no matter how to wrestle.

617
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:04,940
And they are beasts like
it's hand in Ganas 10.

618
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:06,680
Jon Jones is just walking down the street.

619
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:07,514
I'm the,

620
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,190
I have the same size head
and I was just a skinny boy,

621
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,270
so I looked like a lollipop.

622
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,350
I was a wrong bro.

623
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,243
Honestly,

624
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,890
just the runt of the litter by to work.

625
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,850
I had to develop,

626
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,470
I think maybe like around 15,

627
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:19,340
I started to get taller.

628
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,540
So every time I come back from school
or from a holiday after school was right

629
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:22,701
there,

630
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:23,534
you got to call her.

631
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,410
I ain't got taller.

632
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,760
And then somehow I just filled it out,

633
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,770
realize I go athleticism.

634
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,821
And then later on,

635
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:33,650
like I was never the athletic kid
playing basketball or anything like that.

636
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,490
I was just the,

637
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,150
the runt.

638
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,290
When did you get into martial arts?

639
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,050
I started in taekwondo when I was a kid,

640
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,570
just because after school
programs and then what's fun?

641
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,770
It's such a good one for kids,

642
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:43,220
man.

643
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,730
It was fun.

644
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,361
That's why I liked it.

645
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,130
I kinda set all that kind of stuff.

646
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:46,311
Yeah,

647
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:47,030
it was cool.

648
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,510
But um,

649
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:47,811
yeah.

650
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:48,644
And then,

651
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,271
uh,

652
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:50,780
I think I almost got my yellow belt.

653
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,540
Then my mom kind of pulled me out cause
I was just wrecking shop around the

654
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,050
house,

655
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,980
kicking everything.

656
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,340
I broke my arm doing backflips off
the couch and she was just like,

657
00:15:58,341 --> 00:15:58,700
Nah,

658
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,533
no more.

659
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,950
And um,

660
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,740
yeah I found a young buck 20 job film.

661
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,821
I found that,

662
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:05,180
uh,

663
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,960
maybe in two,

664
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,793
uh,

665
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,280
2008 yeah,

666
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:10,760
2008 early 2008 I found
that and I was about 18.

667
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,291
He knows like,

668
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,130
Yo this is cool.

669
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,240
I didn't know what this is.

670
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,900
And then I found that was Moitai found
the Muy Moitai gym and then six weeks

671
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:19,040
later I had my first fight.

672
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,880
Wow.

673
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,570
Yeah,

674
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,403
that's crazy.

675
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,120
And I found a video of that first part,

676
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:26,330
actually I'll throw it up 18 I was 18.

677
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,140
Yeah.

678
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,040
But I'm glad people are like,

679
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,150
oh isn't that a little bit too late?

680
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:31,820
But I'm glad that happened because
I didn't feel like I was born out.

681
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:37,150
Cause I've seen some kids who proteges
fighting from like the age of 12 or 10

682
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,300
and then you like no smoking sheriffs
and then like they get to a certain point

683
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:41,990
and they just like,

684
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,890
I want to do something else.

685
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,670
Not all of them.

686
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,503
Some of them,

687
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,380
sometimes they come back as well but
sometimes they just find out that I'm sick

688
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:48,621
of this,

689
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:48,771
you know,

690
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:49,604
I want to do something else.

691
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,250
You find that a lot with
like sons of trainers.

692
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,410
It was actually the son of one of my,

693
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,480
my first trainer and he's
doing something else now.

694
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:57,370
But yeah,

695
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,090
for me I think 18 was a good year,

696
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:01,850
like good age to start
and I just felt fresh.

697
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:03,740
It was something I want to
do after my first fight.

698
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,850
I was just chasing that again,

699
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,220
that feeling because I've
always been a dancer as well,

700
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:08,720
so I liked that roar of the crowd.

701
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,120
So after my first fight getting
people like probably that was sick,

702
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:11,480
remember that.

703
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:11,751
And I'm like,

704
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:12,584
what the fuck did I do?

705
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,310
I don't remember it.

706
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,240
He just went into a zone.

707
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,750
Yeah Bro.

708
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,321
I was scared.

709
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,340
The guy looked like David Toy,

710
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:17,550
you know when David too had the aircraft,

711
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,030
he was no 80 kgs.

712
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:21,890
He was probably like maybe 92 Mike,

713
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,020
what is 92 and Katie's pounds.

714
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,400
Okay.

715
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,100
Maybe two or five.

716
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:30,100
So 80 Katie's would have been like
say when 85 one 75 or something.

717
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,590
So he was way over where yet,

718
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,370
but my train of kind of just,

719
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:35,660
he was a crazy dude.

720
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:39,740
So he just let it go and that when you
got to realize that at a certain point I

721
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:40,131
realized,

722
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:40,250
okay,

723
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,140
this is not the guy to get me
to that level I want to be.

724
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,790
So I left and I moved to Auckland,

725
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:44,360
New Zealand,

726
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:44,721
Auckland,

727
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:45,470
the main city.

728
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,990
What's your trainer encouraging
brawls too much or what was it?

729
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,440
He wanted me to fight his style.

730
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,120
Like what was that like?

731
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:54,180
You'd always telling me like you need
to have your hands up and you know,

732
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:55,620
he was a real purist of more time.

733
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,940
So he wanted me to have that,

734
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,600
you know,

735
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,240
like the right way and stuff like that.

736
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:03,240
And that's the difference between someone
that wants you to fight like them.

737
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,590
And someone like Eugene and
my coach when he first saw me,

738
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:06,060
he just like,

739
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,893
cool,

740
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,860
we can work with that.

741
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,391
Like he will let,

742
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:11,190
he never tried to make
me fight any and like,

743
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,420
like him,

744
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,250
he never tried to make me
do anything like this guy.

745
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:14,641
He just said,

746
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:15,000
okay,

747
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,260
I want you to jab like this.

748
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,710
And he would almost be like trying to
get someone to write songs like the songs

749
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:19,861
they,

750
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:20,220
right,

751
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,900
exactly.

752
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,290
It's like this is expressions is art.

753
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,370
Let me do me.

754
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,151
And it really is.

755
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:24,370
Yeah.

756
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,500
And he could never understand that.

757
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:26,490
He was like put your hands up.

758
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:27,210
And I,

759
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,460
I like my people said Y'all
and people would still say,

760
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:30,151
get your hands up.

761
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:30,570
I'm like,

762
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,680
that's textbook.

763
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,790
I don't read the textbook.

764
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:33,571
I had to look at it.

765
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,404
It was all right.

766
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,410
I like the balance.

767
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:38,550
I feel when I'm over here,

768
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,361
like my takedowns,

769
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:42,360
I was able to stop them because my hands
are already low and I can still show up

770
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,253
when I need to.

771
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,940
I can still find hands up when I need to,

772
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:47,670
but I like my hands down
aeration when you have to stop.

773
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:48,504
Take downs.

774
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,620
Yeah.

775
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,080
Even the kickbox and my hands were
always down a lot of the times.

776
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,430
Having the ability to get an under hook
or double under hooks quickly putting

777
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,300
kickboxing.

778
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,930
I like my job from there.

779
00:18:57,931 --> 00:18:58,441
From the lowest,

780
00:18:58,441 --> 00:18:59,880
from the lungs because gone,

781
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,000
there's definitely pros
and cons to everything,

782
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:06,990
but a guy who's got the kind of speed
that you have can take advantage many

783
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,210
times more of having hands low.

784
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,360
It really depends.

785
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,370
I mean look at Roy Jones,

786
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,300
how the fuck you say,

787
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,400
how can you fucking you
say hands down is no good.

788
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:16,140
Ryan Jones junior kept his hands down.

789
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:17,310
All that ties as well.

790
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:17,701
You have to,

791
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:19,830
I think you can train the
eyes because my eyes weren't,

792
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,850
I was always like had really
quick reflexes but I think
you can train the eyes

793
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,093
in certain ways.

794
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,900
The Roy could just land
that lead level like a jab,

795
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,493
like his,

796
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,171
his shoulder,

797
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,470
I think snap.

798
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,180
Yeah.

799
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,830
Crazy.

800
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,830
I remember that one with the fall,

801
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:35,281
right hooks.

802
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:36,150
He hit that guy with,

803
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,810
remember he had giant biceps
but he didn't have big triceps.

804
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,370
Like everything was hooks.

805
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,230
It was all like from throwing punches.

806
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,170
That's the thing that most people
were always leading with jobs as well.

807
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,180
So that would never
help him lead left hook.

808
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:50,670
That was something different at the
time that no one could figure out.

809
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,630
They couldn't crack the code.

810
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,450
Roy Jones Jr in his
prime and people people,

811
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:55,440
it's like a song,

812
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,550
it's like a song be tough.

813
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,790
Forgot or they forgot.

814
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,180
Y'All must've forgot that was his song.

815
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,680
His people did forget.

816
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,840
But the first box I ever
saw when I was a kid,

817
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:04,920
cause I never really watched fights.

818
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:07,400
I was playing with
sticks towards whatever,

819
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,180
making my own ship.

820
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,580
I saw Prince Naseem I met and I
remember this when I was about four,

821
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,180
but he will,

822
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,920
cause I always seen boxing on TV,

823
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,880
but he was the first box I saw that just
made me pause and watch and just smile

824
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:18,301
and laugh.

825
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,740
Like what is this?

826
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,940
Oh he was doing crazy shit.

827
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,800
Just cause the way he moved.

828
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,910
And guys,

829
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:24,370
I've always,

830
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,890
I've always been drawn and guys like that.

831
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,724
Like Ali,

832
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,280
even Rashad when he was in
his prime doing this thing,

833
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,473
um,

834
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:30,990
uh,

835
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,711
Roy Jones,

836
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:32,880
you know like porno,

837
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,110
woulda,

838
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,390
coulda,

839
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,050
sweet pea.

840
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,420
Like just people forgot about Whitaker.

841
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:36,961
Exactly.

842
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:37,794
It slept on them.

843
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,090
That shoulder roll.

844
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,560
I mean he was a master at that before
we really saw it from Mayweather.

845
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,390
Mayweather obviously has math.

846
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,820
He gets hit less than
anybody that's ever lived.

847
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,390
Yeah.

848
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,320
Do you think about the fact that guy
is 50 and [inaudible] and really,

849
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,060
I mean you think about
talks while it doesn't,

850
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:57,070
there's no slurring can count.

851
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:57,850
Yeah.

852
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,490
I mean clipped him with one left hand,

853
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:02,070
like real clean and that was it.

854
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:02,710
Uppercut.

855
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,951
Yeah.

856
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:06,670
I mean with a couple other punches
but none of them were like dangerous.

857
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,331
He rolled with them.

858
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:07,481
Yeah.

859
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:09,910
I rolled with everything
in my fight cause I,

860
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,190
I won't point after I felt his jab,

861
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:13,024
I was like,

862
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,930
you know what,

863
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,180
I can just close the
distance a little bit more.

864
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,160
And then that's how I got
the shiner right here.

865
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,023
But the right hands,

866
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,400
this right side's fine cause I was
just rolling with a lot of them.

867
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:22,450
I was rolling with a lot of them.

868
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,520
So you just underestimated his jab.

869
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,370
I underestimated his
head movement at first.

870
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:30,430
So the beginning he was moving away
from my jab and then you just said,

871
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:31,061
or I drop it down,

872
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:32,200
drop it down to the Chin a little bit.

873
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,520
And I did.

874
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,353
Um,

875
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,280
but eventually I could adjust.

876
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:38,320
I think from round two
I figured out the range,

877
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,213
but his jab,

878
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,430
it wasn't as powerful
as I want to as I ask.

879
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,181
I assumed it would be.

880
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:43,750
So I thought,

881
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,160
oh I can just take and give.

882
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,210
And that's how I got the shine.

883
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:47,140
I ran into one of them.

884
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,161
But yeah,

885
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:49,090
it was a big mistake.

886
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,013
Silly mistake.

887
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,981
So,

888
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:51,400
uh,

889
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,300
on the same card,

890
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,330
Uriah hall fought Polo Kosta,

891
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,500
a lot of people are thinking that might
be the next fight for you told Dana

892
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,371
funny stories.

893
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:02,410
So went to him after my fight,

894
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:04,270
I told him I would tell her I'm
just hanging out with my boys.

895
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:05,530
But then after dance,

896
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,090
if I went out and,

897
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:07,480
um,

898
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,060
someone told me,

899
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,181
Oh,

900
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:09,011
Dan is in this club,

901
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:09,490
he's the same.

902
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,031
I was all cool.

903
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:10,990
That's whatever.

904
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,950
And when I got some money and I was
talking to the guy to lead me and then

905
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,360
because he found out I'm a UFC fighter,

906
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:18,570
he just led me to the private
room and I see Mcmahon,

907
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:18,761
I'm like,

908
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:19,360
what the hell?

909
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,900
And they were just thought yarning.

910
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,430
I talking to people and he's an should
Dana and I finally meet Dana properly and

911
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:26,470
we start talking and I
dropped his name in there.

912
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:26,761
I said,

913
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:26,881
yeah,

914
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:27,970
I want to fight Paula next.

915
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,893
And he's like,

916
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,550
they have other ideas,

917
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:30,761
you know,

918
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:31,241
fair enough.

919
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:32,074
But I can,

920
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,580
they've done this a long time.

921
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:34,360
They're promoters,

922
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:34,870
you know,

923
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,360
so I think what they want is me,

924
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,321
you know,

925
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:39,550
being a bigger name,

926
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,330
Paul being a bigger name and we
fight like in some super fight.

927
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,831
I can see what that,

928
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:45,880
you know why that boy for me,

929
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:46,450
I want to,

930
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,590
I want to take him out now.

931
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,900
He just knocked out,

932
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,250
reorder hall was talking Mad Shit as well,

933
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:51,731
you know.

934
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:53,590
But yeah,

935
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:57,100
I want to take him out now before cause
he's going to eat before we fight again.

936
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,750
We'll probably fight more
than once cause he's,

937
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,590
he's the one of those guys.

938
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,730
Well we'll see what happens.

939
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,350
How long has the UFC career last?

940
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:03,760
But I think we'll probably fight with me.

941
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:05,080
And you appropriate five more than once.

942
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:05,711
Yeah,

943
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:06,850
I would imagine that as well.

944
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,250
I was very impressed with
him versus Uriah Hall.

945
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,240
It was interesting because the contrast
between your fight on Friday night in

946
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:13,300
his fight on Saturday night,

947
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,433
that was just a bra.

948
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,520
Like a technical bro.

949
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,590
He got hit with a lot of jabs,

950
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:20,560
but he is a relentless
marauding y'all the fucker.

951
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:21,170
That guy is.

952
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,250
He's very,

953
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,140
yeah.

954
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,430
And this thing's free footwork.

955
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,151
Uriah Hall.

956
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:26,680
I was watching my why you right there.

957
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,560
It's easy to look good at getting
someone who just sits right there like a

958
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:30,190
punching bag.

959
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:30,880
You know,

960
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,740
you Riaa had tremendous potential and
when we saw him in the ultimate fighter,

961
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:36,400
we all saw it.

962
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,090
But it also might be similar to what you
were talking about with sage Northcutt

963
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,510
where who are also thinking as Trump
still has tremendous potential and still

964
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:44,320
very young.

965
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,220
I think there's an approach to take

966
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,530
that you took that I
think is really smart.

967
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:48,951
You know,

968
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:52,910
I got it from one of the talk shows you
if she talk shows Katie floor and just

969
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:53,744
said it.

970
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,120
He said,

971
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,500
um,

972
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,650
get your experience outside of
the UFC before you go in the UFC.

973
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,813
Wise words,

974
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:59,803
10 fights,

975
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,630
nine fights and just like
fight a lot of good guys.

976
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:03,180
Not just like,

977
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,560
you know,

978
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,251
listen to me man.

979
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:06,560
You don't want to fight
you on your second fight,

980
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,170
right?

981
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,230
Imagine you're a guy,

982
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:10,460
you could throw a couple of good punches,

983
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:12,830
you think you're a bad ass and
then your stupid coach says,

984
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,071
okay,

985
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:13,904
you're going to fight this guy.

986
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,800
They call him the style bender like,

987
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:16,530
okay,

988
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,210
okay,

989
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,043
okay,

990
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,093
I'll fuck up.

991
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,371
I'll fight anybody.

992
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:21,204
You all fight for the title.

993
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,430
Yeah.

994
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,121
Those guys,

995
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:24,920
they get lit up and they don't understand.

996
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,030
They really don't understand.

997
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:26,901
Jumping in the pool too.

998
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:28,820
Quick conversation with a friend
of mine who was a Jujitsu,

999
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,260
he was bad ass did you do too?

1000
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,070
And he said,

1001
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,550
um,

1002
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,890
he was going to uh,

1003
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,250
go into MMA and I'm like,

1004
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:34,850
okay,

1005
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,200
how long have you been training striking?

1006
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,011
And he's like,

1007
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:41,510
well you know he goes for the last four
months pretty regularly or are you out

1008
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:42,260
of your fucking mind?

1009
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:42,471
I go,

1010
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:43,010
listen to me man.

1011
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,090
He was a black belt in Jujitsu,

1012
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,283
nasty on the ground.

1013
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,711
I go,

1014
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:49,640
think about what you could do if I was
a white belt and I came in here and I

1015
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:52,100
didn't know shit and I was
like a strong guy or maybe uh,

1016
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:52,431
you know,

1017
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:55,370
played basketball or something like
that was just an athletic and I tried to

1018
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:56,180
fight you.

1019
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,880
How bad would you fuck me
up on the ground right now?

1020
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,500
Think of someone doing the exact same
thing like that to you with stand up cause

1021
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,290
you don't understand that
there are guys who can do that.

1022
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,910
Tyrone Spong there's you,

1023
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,060
there's these high level kickboxers it,

1024
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,040
you don't have a chance.

1025
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,770
You think you have a chance because
you're fast and you don't have a chance,

1026
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,723
you're going to get hit,

1027
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,490
you're going to get fucked up and you
got to get hit multiple times and they're

1028
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:21,930
going to chip away at you until they
decided to move in for the kill.

1029
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:23,030
And then they're gonna fuck you up.

1030
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:24,530
It's not a damn thing
you could do about it.

1031
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,010
And it's almost the same as
him grabbing a white belt,

1032
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:30,080
let them flail around and
then eventually choking them.

1033
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:31,160
It's an inevitable thing.

1034
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,980
But the weird thing is
some people don't see that.

1035
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:36,800
They don't see that someone could
do to them in a certain art.

1036
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,330
They don't study activity.

1037
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:38,660
Yeah.

1038
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,770
That's the thing for me.

1039
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,840
I'm always thinking like in anything,

1040
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:42,740
why am I doing this?

1041
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,940
Why am I feeling this way?

1042
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:44,141
Right.

1043
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:44,900
A right or wrong.

1044
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,250
And that's why I said I
moved to him and made,

1045
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:48,830
cause I just know I want to be the best.

1046
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:49,131
You know,

1047
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,470
I couldn't be in the best kickboxer ever.

1048
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,950
I can live with that best boxer as well.

1049
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:53,550
But I just thought in my,

1050
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,670
Milan is a guy who
could fuck you up fight.

1051
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,990
It's not just on the ground.

1052
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,250
I've seen so many street fights,

1053
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,113
so many streetlights.

1054
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,451
I'm like,

1055
00:25:59,451 --> 00:25:59,950
dude,

1056
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,783
just put your knee down.

1057
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,260
It was like just holding
each other and just hitting,

1058
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:03,531
hitting.

1059
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:03,801
I'm like,

1060
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:05,000
you can easily just check the guy.

1061
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:05,131
Right.

1062
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,050
And if you knew what you were doing,

1063
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,390
so that's a [inaudible].

1064
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:08,224
He's a champion.

1065
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,730
80% of street fights end up on the
ground and people don't know what they're

1066
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:11,240
doing.

1067
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,200
So I just felt like I never want to be
in a situation where a guy like gets me

1068
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,250
in an alleyway and tries to like fuck me
up and just snap my uncle or some shit.

1069
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:22,340
But I just feel like I want
to be able to be well versed,

1070
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,090
take care of all areas and I'll probably
never get there or I'll die trying.

1071
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,560
Well how old are you now?

1072
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,670
28 I'll be 29 to in a few years on.

1073
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,880
Still literally,

1074
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,170
you're still at least a year or two
years away from your suppose at physical

1075
00:26:36,171 --> 00:26:36,530
plant,

1076
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,040
right?

1077
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,840
An athlete.

1078
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,390
They,

1079
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,640
they say that for a professional athlete,

1080
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,260
obviously they say,

1081
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:44,250
what does that everybody's variables.

1082
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,930
There's something around age 30 to 32
will your mind and body catch up and you

1083
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:49,651
have a window.

1084
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:53,790
They're like Anderson Silva when
he was like 30 to 32 woo going,

1085
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,743
I remember that.

1086
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,700
You would watch him.

1087
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,230
You just like put your
hands to your head and go,

1088
00:26:58,231 --> 00:26:58,810
Gee,

1089
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,750
the first one I saw live was UFC.

1090
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,730
He fought Patrick Otay.

1091
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,480
Oh yeah.

1092
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,570
But like for me that feels very smart.

1093
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,080
But that first round he uses like probably
seven different styles to just hit

1094
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:10,530
him.

1095
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,990
And then I keep saying he
uses telekinesis on his knee.

1096
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,051
He just it out.

1097
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:17,310
But like Patrick had a fucked up need
going into that fight I think already it's

1098
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:17,610
hard.

1099
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,151
Hard to tell,

1100
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:19,760
but it seemed like it gave Alpha flight.

1101
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,550
It was a good fight.

1102
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,180
He just stood on end.

1103
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,013
It's like Ah,

1104
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,020
like went to like throw a front
kick and it just buckled on.

1105
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,903
It popped out.

1106
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,460
Yeah,

1107
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,150
not but like that fight that first round,

1108
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,340
the way he just handled him.

1109
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:30,870
I was like that.

1110
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,620
Yeah.

1111
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,453
That's the guy.

1112
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:32,870
You know what,

1113
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,750
it really did open up the recipe to
giving Anderson trouble though because the

1114
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:40,260
recipe to giving Anderson Start Talis
latest opened it up and so they might

1115
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,460
know.

1116
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,050
But the real key was don't engage
because if you chase after him,

1117
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:46,920
he's gonna fuck you up.

1118
00:27:46,921 --> 00:27:47,754
Like Stryker,

1119
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,840
Forrest Griffin,

1120
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,660
all these different people
that came at him up for sure.

1121
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:52,494
Chris Leben.

1122
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,700
That was how the first one,

1123
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:55,410
92nd recipe for disaster.

1124
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,690
I mean I knew when I saw that
fight on paper I was like,

1125
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,531
oh,

1126
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,460
this is crazy.

1127
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:04,590
Oh you got a guy who's like the most
reckless iron chinned marauder in the UFC

1128
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,520
and you're putting up against a guy who's
like a Ninja and this is going to be

1129
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,290
crazy and this is a perfect fight.

1130
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,540
It was a perfect fight in terms
of like what you want to see,

1131
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:15,930
like the effectiveness of
like high level timing,

1132
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:17,970
speed and perfect technique.

1133
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:18,804
Like whoa.

1134
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,000
The way he did it as well as clean.

1135
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,650
I think he only got hit once that fight.

1136
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:24,270
He let it like 100% of the shots.

1137
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:24,780
Yeah.

1138
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,460
And that fight.

1139
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:25,880
Yeah,

1140
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,491
it was beautiful.

1141
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:26,911
Crazy,

1142
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:27,690
and that's how I started.

1143
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,220
I was a counter strike at first.

1144
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:29,970
That's when I started.

1145
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,810
I was always like,

1146
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,960
I'll wait for guys to come in here.

1147
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,870
Here it is right here.

1148
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,550
Call and tell people because I was afraid.

1149
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,540
I was a fan of Anderson's
from watching him fight.

1150
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,950
Look at that Jab.

1151
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,940
I was a fan of watching him fight in
England and cage rage and watch him fight

1152
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:47,340
and pride and I remember saying this,

1153
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:48,000
ladies and gentlemen,

1154
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,660
this is a different kind of Stryker.

1155
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,090
This is,

1156
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,200
this is one of the first times you
got a high level look at the looks.

1157
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:58,650
He's given them as well to show the
faints and the various of his feet.

1158
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:00,300
Man Bounce.

1159
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:00,870
He's on.

1160
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,950
People forget man.

1161
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:02,800
Look how good he paying.

1162
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,240
He's already,

1163
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,880
he's over.

1164
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,120
Yeah.

1165
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,411
Pain,

1166
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:04,720
pain.

1167
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,420
Pawlik at that come on site for him
to get up again and then me pain,

1168
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,283
pain,

1169
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:10,711
pain,

1170
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:11,544
pain,

1171
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,563
just as hurt.

1172
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,980
Let me come on man.

1173
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:15,510
Almost every shot lands.

1174
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:16,650
He's not getting home.

1175
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,730
It's incredible.

1176
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,780
It's over insane.

1177
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,750
Chris was a beast man.

1178
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:22,441
He could take a shot.

1179
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:23,730
He could take it all the time.

1180
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,590
There was one with them was not my Easton.

1181
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,370
It was a guy,

1182
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,690
a rock them and he has,

1183
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:29,430
he's moving back as
he's hurt and he drops.

1184
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:31,260
The guy knocks him out to hold.

1185
00:29:31,261 --> 00:29:31,621
Yeah,

1186
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:31,951
no,

1187
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:33,930
Chris could take a tremendous shot.

1188
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:35,520
He was had unbelievable heart.

1189
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,721
But Anderson,

1190
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:37,710
I feel like in that,

1191
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,260
that's my argument for
Anderson being the goat.

1192
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,913
There's more,

1193
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,080
it's him and feed or,

1194
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,351
right.

1195
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:44,800
Yeah.

1196
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,540
I saw as kid though,

1197
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,570
the day after my fight,

1198
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,191
I didn't record it.

1199
00:29:47,191 --> 00:29:47,560
I was like,

1200
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,393
in the elevator,

1201
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,820
you're Anderson's son.

1202
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,050
He's like,

1203
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:50,830
yeah,

1204
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,663
baby goat.

1205
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,210
But the only other person is the
current guys is mighty mouse.

1206
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,280
The argument against mighty
mouse is he's cleaned out,

1207
00:29:57,281 --> 00:29:58,090
division out.

1208
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:02,230
He doesn't have a Chris Weidman and you
know a guy who's trying to fuck him up.

1209
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:05,270
He doesn't have like someone who you
really give a chance to the level.

1210
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,340
Right.

1211
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,710
I mean there's never been a
situation where like mighty mouse,

1212
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,790
mighty mouse had a chill son and who had
him down on points in the fourth round

1213
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,740
fucking him up and then he
catches them in a triangle.

1214
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:14,861
No,

1215
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:18,730
that flyaway definitely
wait and he dominates man.

1216
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:19,960
He just runs through people.

1217
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,370
Is he going gonna fight him?

1218
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:25,870
What's his name on next mighty mouse
is fighting to Hutto in a rematch,

1219
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,630
which he stopped better.

1220
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,400
Who to go better and um,

1221
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,610
since the first fight.

1222
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,031
Yeah.

1223
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:33,640
So who does a Olympic
gold medals and wrestling.

1224
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,860
That's all you need to know and
to stand up as well as clean.

1225
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:36,980
He's Kinda improved.

1226
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,050
I'll give them Qualicum credit.

1227
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:38,280
Yeah.

1228
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,100
Wilson Hayes fine.

1229
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,880
Yeah.

1230
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,160
He looked like he was crazy.

1231
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,190
Almost like McGregor out.

1232
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,211
Yeah.

1233
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:46,870
It was weird.

1234
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,621
So he can learn fast.

1235
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:48,280
It's another guy.

1236
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,150
Great at wrestling.

1237
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,580
Transfer that greatness into learning.

1238
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,570
Stand up at night.

1239
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,040
It just mixing them together.

1240
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:54,491
That's the thing.

1241
00:30:54,491 --> 00:30:57,580
If you have to look at GSP that just
learning how to like Mesh them together

1242
00:30:57,581 --> 00:31:01,390
without like getting stuck on
thinking too much is flowing with it.

1243
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,350
Yeah.

1244
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:02,861
That's the key.

1245
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,860
I think particularly the Wilson hates
fight because it showed that he can adjust

1246
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:08,920
his style like pretty radically
when he walked out like this.

1247
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:09,491
I remember going,

1248
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:10,324
Whoa,

1249
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,250
karate man,

1250
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:13,270
this is crazy.

1251
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,250
Give him credit where credit's due.

1252
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,900
Well again,

1253
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,480
when you're a gold medalist
in the Olympics in wrestling,

1254
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,520
that's a special kind of human being.

1255
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,420
That's the next level.

1256
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,060
It's just a special kind of human being
and the wrestling training I do now,

1257
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:26,440
I'm like fuck.

1258
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:31,790
Sometimes we have on Wednesdays on
Wednesdays it's a vo two max color rate

1259
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:35,800
wrestle Wednesday just cause it's
like air dyne and then wrestling.

1260
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:38,610
It's two minutes on the airdyne
going hard with a heart rate monitor,

1261
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:41,800
trying to get to the red zone and then
wrestling for two minutes trying to get

1262
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:43,240
to the red zone and shot to Kevin,

1263
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,231
Kevin Bentley.

1264
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:45,610
He's the guy that showed me the most,

1265
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:46,120
this camp.

1266
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:51,120
So you know that my hips were on point
because every time I'd like stuff or take

1267
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:51,910
down and get back up,

1268
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,210
right.

1269
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:52,690
Boom.

1270
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,900
Another one that I have to like Jesus
Christ is leave me alone cause he's just

1271
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:57,970
on you like a blanket like yeah.

1272
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,800
So that kind of work as hard.

1273
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:01,600
So imagine being a gold medalist.

1274
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,760
What kind of wrestling training
it takes to get to that level.

1275
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:08,380
Well that's why when you see a real high
level wrestler against almost everybody

1276
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:09,010
else,

1277
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,320
they have such a no dige
advantage in the clinch.

1278
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:12,170
Like Daniel Cormier,

1279
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,810
tp meal church this weekend.

1280
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,700
I mean Dominick Cruz,

1281
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:16,534
it was such a,

1282
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,280
we're very fortunate to have a
guide that knowledgeable in cause.

1283
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:24,040
Dominic's knowledgeable about basically
everything he started out as a wrestler

1284
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,240
but he understands MMA as good as anybody
that's ever talked on the mic about

1285
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:27,850
MMA.

1286
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,660
He's very clued up.

1287
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,440
So when he talked about like he showed
me some stuff that I hadn't caught about

1288
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:37,441
Daniel's giving up the underhook so that
he could limp arm and then Steve Bay

1289
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:39,980
would run right into the right hand and

1290
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,150
they had it all timed out.

1291
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,750
I've really broken down the file.

1292
00:32:42,751 --> 00:32:45,530
It's just I was already looking
at a time and I was lazy.

1293
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,190
I was yelling off my
face just like wow dude,

1294
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:50,750
when he connected and then he hit him.

1295
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,830
I don't even know if I said anything cause
I remember I was going like I thought

1296
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,800
was be five rounds,

1297
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:55,634
five rounds.

1298
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,280
There was a Deja Vu moment
like the world just changed.

1299
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,920
He just knock them out of nowhere and
it was so close on the ground and it

1300
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:04,790
stands up to the picture
I put on Instagram.

1301
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,610
That is a beautiful picture of it cause
they've been working together for so

1302
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,420
long.

1303
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,410
When Jon Anik stands up and he DC looks
in here when they looked at each other,

1304
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,851
look at that picture.

1305
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:14,750
Come on man.

1306
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:19,430
Who the fuck else is a two time world
champion in two divisions and also a

1307
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:22,490
commentator currently and
a great working two jobs.

1308
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,240
God I love that guy man.

1309
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,170
I got these chunky as well
cause he just like chuck.

1310
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,100
He's a nice way of putting it.

1311
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,390
No honestly these Chunky,

1312
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,940
maybe there was a girl,

1313
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:32,774
what would you call her?

1314
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,833
Thick,

1315
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,043
thick boy.

1316
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,400
Like he doesn't give a fuck.

1317
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,160
This ain't even fat shaming.

1318
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,210
That's the God damn two division champion.

1319
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,830
I was talking to he and his nutrition
and he says like two 46 boy,

1320
00:33:43,831 --> 00:33:45,260
it doesn't move like two 46 I was like,

1321
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:45,680
yeah,

1322
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,910
100% so it's deceptive.

1323
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,120
You look at him like even my hunt,

1324
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:49,970
he's another guy like that.

1325
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:51,200
But last Saturday,

1326
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:52,160
the way he was moving,

1327
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,740
well Javier Mendez was talking
about it and then camping.

1328
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,911
So was Bob Cook.

1329
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,890
They were telling me after the
fight they go dude and heavyweight,

1330
00:33:57,891 --> 00:33:59,480
he's knocking everybody
out and training part.

1331
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,100
It's about strike for us.

1332
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:01,730
How about that?

1333
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,640
They heard that a lot of strife,

1334
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,490
undefeated Strikeforce,

1335
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,780
fucking Grand Prix,

1336
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:07,790
heavyweight champion
tossing the upper neck,

1337
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:08,561
big flood,

1338
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:09,201
dropping them,

1339
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:09,920
all that kind of shit.

1340
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,340
I was like,

1341
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,560
and that was brought up with five
rounds and he wasn't even like,

1342
00:34:12,561 --> 00:34:13,250
he was early.

1343
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,480
That was early in his career.

1344
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,733
So I was like,

1345
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,640
you guys all understand.

1346
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,870
So I thought was going to be DC,

1347
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:19,010
putting them against the fence,

1348
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,550
grinding them out for five rounds and
still beating them up for like fucking

1349
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:23,600
them up and back and forth.

1350
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:25,010
But knock in the first round.

1351
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:25,844
That was just

1352
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:27,830
crazy.

1353
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,170
I thought DC was going to win it.

1354
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,920
What was gonna happen was they were going
to get into the second and third and

1355
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:35,110
they were going to start getting tired.

1356
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,650
DC's restaurant was going to take over.

1357
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,030
Those are the five rounds,

1358
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,980
unanimous to DC,

1359
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:43,640
but I felt like he had to somehow or
another where Steve pay out a little bit

1360
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:46,070
before he gets takedowns and
get him back against the fence.

1361
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,780
I thought that would be
the smart thing to do,

1362
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,450
but I thought it was real dangerous
standing up because Steve pays,

1363
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:51,950
knocked out junior dos Santos.

1364
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,030
Alistair Overeem knocked out for
preschool for doing with one punch.

1365
00:34:56,031 --> 00:34:56,301
I mean,

1366
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:57,081
you think all the people,

1367
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:58,220
Steve Bay's knocked out and you go,

1368
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:58,611
damn.

1369
00:34:58,611 --> 00:35:00,230
And dcs coming up as a light heavyweight.

1370
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,080
DC CDC hurt was a rumble.

1371
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,890
Right?

1372
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,191
Well,

1373
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:04,821
Jon Jones,

1374
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:07,440
obviously John Jones Jones knock them out.

1375
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:07,890
Yeah,

1376
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:08,723
forget that.

1377
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,200
John capitalized
brilliantly on a tendency.

1378
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,771
You know,

1379
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:14,000
he knew that DC,

1380
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,160
he talks about leading.

1381
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,510
What's interesting is that Dominick
Cruz explained this to me as well,

1382
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:25,750
is that this is how DC prefers to set up
the single and that he prefers to lean

1383
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:27,110
it on that side,

1384
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,570
leaning towards his right side
and then dive in on the single,

1385
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:29,931
that's his,

1386
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:33,080
his preferred technique is very strong
and dragging you to the ground from that

1387
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:33,914
position.

1388
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,100
So you have the tendency,

1389
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,170
every level.

1390
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:37,690
John Jones,

1391
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,190
myself,

1392
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,090
when I was watching my fight,

1393
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,320
I've only seen it once.

1394
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,420
I was after the fight rewinding,

1395
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:45,090
I took about an hour and a
half to finish watching it.

1396
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,200
Just rewinding,

1397
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:46,861
playing,

1398
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:47,694
drinking with my friends,

1399
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,530
whatnot,

1400
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,700
because they understand that I just
like to be with myself and just chill.

1401
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:52,770
So they just doing their own thing
and then we'll just playing games,

1402
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:55,980
but I watch it to see what I did
right and I enjoy it was okay,

1403
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:56,491
this is what I did,

1404
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:56,731
good,

1405
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:56,881
blah,

1406
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:56,961
blah,

1407
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:57,051
blah,

1408
00:35:57,051 --> 00:35:57,211
blah,

1409
00:35:57,211 --> 00:35:58,044
blah.

1410
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,970
But then I see if I
was fighting me harder,

1411
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:00,804
fuck me up now.

1412
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,250
Ooh,

1413
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,643
yeah,

1414
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,580
I can see certain things.

1415
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:05,881
Okay,

1416
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:06,170
this is,

1417
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,580
I need to work on tendencies,

1418
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:09,780
certain tenants and change it up.

1419
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,680
Confused people,

1420
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,623
scramble them.

1421
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,170
Some of the things I
was doing in that fight,

1422
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,190
I've never done it in training.

1423
00:36:14,191 --> 00:36:14,821
Cause example,

1424
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:15,720
elbow pads we don't,

1425
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,940
I haven't really worn that will
pass and training just knee pads.

1426
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,260
I was using that ung back elbow to set
up how to close the distance and I was

1427
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:22,561
watching it.

1428
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:22,771
I was like,

1429
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:23,730
what did I learn that from?

1430
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,530
I don't know,

1431
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:25,981
like watch.

1432
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:27,030
I did it probably three times.

1433
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:30,870
I'd use the fake young buck elbow to
close the gap and I'd Gallop in and catch

1434
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:32,040
him with a right hand or something.

1435
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,100
But I never like certain certain things
like that were were things like they're

1436
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:38,630
good but then I can't really say
the kind of thing you did that.

1437
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,571
Yeah,

1438
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:39,930
don't.

1439
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,880
Yeah.

1440
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,870
Do you think that maybe
that when you learn,

1441
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,800
it's almost like you're learning words,

1442
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,210
like in these words are techniques
and then combinations or sentences.

1443
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:55,450
And then in like the having
the mastery of all these words,

1444
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,460
you just see a new sentence
that you could say,

1445
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:57,820
yeah,

1446
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,590
I was like already know how I throw those.

1447
00:36:59,591 --> 00:37:01,840
Obviously even though you
don't do it a lot in sparring,

1448
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,550
he just sees something he's doing like,

1449
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:03,881
you know what,

1450
00:37:03,881 --> 00:37:06,550
this is what I'm going to
this and then come in here and

1451
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,230
yeah,

1452
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,160
like that one was nice,

1453
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:10,260
but there was one of my last
fight before that and Arizona,

1454
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:10,650
um,

1455
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:15,360
Sean O'Malley throws dislike spin
and then the head kick in the fight.

1456
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:16,194
I was like,

1457
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,123
it feels right.

1458
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,860
Boom.

1459
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,810
First time I ever landed it.

1460
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,880
And it caught him on the back
of the head and I was like,

1461
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:21,714
oh good.

1462
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,890
And I just kept them moving with it.

1463
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,730
Jack Rule,

1464
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:27,720
when Yahya Rodriguez ThreeSixty
roundhouse kicked Bj Penn in the face.

1465
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:28,081
I was like,

1466
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:28,461
yeah,

1467
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:29,670
you gotta be fucking kidding.

1468
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,980
Cause I was always wondering
when are we going to see this?

1469
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,740
I've done the one I knocked out,

1470
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,030
knocked down a heavy weight with it,

1471
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:36,920
like a tornado kickoff.

1472
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,510
And I learnt that about a
month and a half before.

1473
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,680
Shout out to David.

1474
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,551
He's the guy,

1475
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,930
he's a taekwondo champion
from New Zealand.

1476
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,953
And he told me,

1477
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,630
cause I should throw it with the right
roundhouse and then spin with it and he

1478
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:52,560
said that's too much telegraphing you're
showing the guy I'm going to kick it

1479
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,060
cause he'll lean back and he'd come back.

1480
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,970
So he said go south
port and use your torso.

1481
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,560
So I'll give it away.

1482
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,940
You throw your shoulder,

1483
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,490
your left shoulder from south port
to call her after a few right hand.

1484
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:06,810
So he kind of hammer throw a right hand
and then spin that spin right there

1485
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:08,280
cause y'all ain't taekwondo
national champion.

1486
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:08,651
So you know,

1487
00:38:08,651 --> 00:38:11,840
so that spin right there generates the
force and I was able to knock down,

1488
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:12,900
knock down the guy with it.

1489
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,490
I never had anybody with that

1490
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,790
heavy bag with that a lot.

1491
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,391
Exactly.

1492
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:19,350
Make sure they can't move.

1493
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:21,690
So I'd like to do it when they're
against the fence or they're against the

1494
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:22,140
ropes.

1495
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,760
So that way they have
nowhere to go or not.

1496
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,700
Not as much space to,

1497
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:25,291
to move around.

1498
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:27,330
But if you're in the open
and talk to land land that,

1499
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:27,731
you know,

1500
00:38:27,731 --> 00:38:32,731
what's really a remarkably effective is
that Raymond Daniels sidekick to jump

1501
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:33,990
spinning back kick.

1502
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,980
I can do it on the bag.

1503
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,903
Yeah,

1504
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,960
I definitely have did
it in sparring before,

1505
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:39,500
but when I saw Rick,

1506
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,710
Rufus w the one of his first fights,

1507
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,810
it's really important
fight with a Thai champion.

1508
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:44,411
Well,

1509
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:45,700
he was fucking him up in the first round.

1510
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:47,980
We played it back because it
was a really interesting moment.

1511
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,020
I think on Youtube it's labeled as the
most important fight and kickboxing.

1512
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,190
And what it was was the first fight where
we got to see Rick Rufus in his prime

1513
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,061
face,

1514
00:38:58,061 --> 00:38:59,170
a Thai champion,

1515
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,180
and this dude and Rick was
winning in the beginning.

1516
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:02,320
And one of the things
that he hit him with,

1517
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:02,800
he did,

1518
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,700
he did that touch side kick,

1519
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:05,351
spinning back,

1520
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:06,100
kick in the air.

1521
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,930
This is the fight that change history.

1522
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,270
Is this a Lawrence can chain as well?

1523
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,060
Yeah.

1524
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,810
Yes.

1525
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:12,220
Oh,

1526
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,090
that guy's a treasure.

1527
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:13,660
Love his work.

1528
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:13,901
Yeah.

1529
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:15,340
Go Google him,

1530
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,323
uh,

1531
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,910
or check out his videos on youtube.

1532
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,990
He's got so many,

1533
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,130
he had just had a breakdown.

1534
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:23,140
I like the way they kind of
work off each other as well.

1535
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:24,010
Like a lot of these guys,

1536
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:24,581
they don't really,

1537
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:25,414
um,

1538
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,261
there's no competition.

1539
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:30,260
They all working through to get a
full report and Robin black as well.

1540
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,130
All these guys,

1541
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:31,963
he's crazy.

1542
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,640
But I really love about Lawrence though,

1543
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:33,991
is that,

1544
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:34,210
you know,

1545
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:38,680
he breaks down things and shows him in
slow motion as is Brenda Dorman and Jack

1546
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:38,681
Slack.

1547
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:39,820
There's a lot of these guys that do this.

1548
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,693
Was that,

1549
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,440
I don't remember.

1550
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,580
I don't remember how much Rick Wade,

1551
00:39:45,581 --> 00:39:47,470
I know he went up to like 200 pounds,

1552
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:51,460
but I think he started out in the sixties
or seventies at the most because this

1553
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,440
Thai guys pretty thick
and I got the pants.

1554
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:53,981
Yeah.

1555
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:56,380
Well he didn't understand how
to deal with the leg kicks.

1556
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,161
This was,

1557
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,240
this was a chewed him up,

1558
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,530
but early in the fight,

1559
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,750
I think in the first round,

1560
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:05,980
see what this is showing is how the tie
starts taking over with the leg kicks.

1561
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,850
But I think in the first round
he hit him with that sidekick,

1562
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:10,720
uh,

1563
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,001
jumps,

1564
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:11,680
spinning back,

1565
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,390
kick to the face and really hurt him.

1566
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,630
Yeah.

1567
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,400
This is a Lawrence is breakdown instead.

1568
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:15,880
This is,

1569
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,290
this is just going to show how he lost,

1570
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,420
see how he tried to throw that
body kick and the Chi checked.

1571
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,553
Yeah.

1572
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,500
Let's fall by two.

1573
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,333
The hit him with,

1574
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:24,070
oh,

1575
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,240
he heard him with that left hand.

1576
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,431
He dropped it.

1577
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:27,220
Oh Shit.

1578
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,431
Yeah.

1579
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:27,640
No,

1580
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,620
Rick had his moments in
this fight and for sure.

1581
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,173
And um,

1582
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,610
it showed just what a
dangerous striker he was,

1583
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:34,211
but we didn't,

1584
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:36,460
we just really didn't know
back then about the leg kicks.

1585
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:38,890
Yeah.

1586
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,850
I felt some Thai guys,

1587
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:40,301
the legs,

1588
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:42,700
the legs literally feel
like just concrete.

1589
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,090
Yeah.

1590
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,690
They're broken down from years.

1591
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,000
Mine.

1592
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,720
All right.

1593
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,030
Like I,

1594
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,910
it feels like a stegosaurus.

1595
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,320
Stegosauruses back with
some times when you feel it.

1596
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,770
It's like steel too.

1597
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:53,170
I felt so the first time
somebody kicked me in my leg,

1598
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:56,230
I felt so vulnerable because I
couldn't believe how easy it was.

1599
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:56,890
Hundred percent.

1600
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,610
I was the first,

1601
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,421
my first thought was,

1602
00:40:58,421 --> 00:40:59,021
God damn.

1603
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,480
And I have to recalibrate
everything I thought about fighting.

1604
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,260
I fought at Karate Guy a cure cause she
can guy a and maybe two hours notice

1605
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:07,150
cause my appointed decided at the winds.

1606
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:07,984
He's like,

1607
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,090
I'm not fighting him,

1608
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,770
but what you do that made
him say that a black.

1609
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,260
And then this Guy Jamie [inaudible]
who I fought I think four times now.

1610
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,680
So he came over to corner one of his
teammates and he was a national QCC Shin

1611
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,040
champion cause I'll fight him.

1612
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:30,874
Cool.

1613
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,860
Jump in the ring and it's padded.

1614
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:33,740
Fight everything.

1615
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,350
Uh Yep.

1616
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,201
Two leg kicks in.

1617
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:36,471
I was like,

1618
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:37,670
whatever I can keep going.

1619
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,470
And then by the fourth
one I remember like,

1620
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,483
Ooh,

1621
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,383
okay,

1622
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,440
don't do that again.

1623
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,610
And then from there it was too late.

1624
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:46,160
That was only in the
first round eight my legs,

1625
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:47,510
he ate my legs.

1626
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,580
And I remember for about
three weeks after that fight,

1627
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,380
walking was just,

1628
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,490
I didn't want to walk.

1629
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,271
Every time I'd be like,

1630
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:56,690
can you pass me this all just like
crawling places and the hate walking.

1631
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,800
But Fun family.

1632
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,520
How long?

1633
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,353
About three weeks,

1634
00:41:59,480 --> 00:41:59,961
maybe two,

1635
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:00,381
two and a half,

1636
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:01,310
three weeks after that fight.

1637
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:01,880
And it's just,

1638
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,181
you know,

1639
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:03,950
your legs are dead heavy,

1640
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:06,500
filled with blood and bruises and it's
just any little movement because your

1641
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:07,520
knees are swollen as well.

1642
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:08,340
Sharp pain.

1643
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,380
A hated it.

1644
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,390
Fucking hate take before you recovered.

1645
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:11,961
Probably.

1646
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:12,231
Yeah,

1647
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:13,580
about three weeks.

1648
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:15,470
Four weeks I heel Quik like honestly,

1649
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:15,980
it's weird.

1650
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,371
Crazy.

1651
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:16,641
Yeah.

1652
00:42:16,641 --> 00:42:18,620
I Dunno why he called to
her when he fought Pedro.

1653
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:20,370
His owed needed six months of Rehab,

1654
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,980
six months to six man,

1655
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,790
it still has a dent in his leg
apparently from that fire shit,

1656
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,230
Pedro gave a Denta
Kevin random until shit,

1657
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,610
I never saw anybody kicked it
back like Pedro or kick a people

1658
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,310
[inaudible] hills Jujitsu and like the,

1659
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,770
the mid nineties and Bas
Rutten was running it back
at the time and Pedro Huizar

1660
00:42:39,771 --> 00:42:40,540
was over there.

1661
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,130
That blue box dude he had,

1662
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,210
they had this big ass 200 pound fucking
heavyweight and Pedro his are folded.

1663
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,001
That thing should,

1664
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:49,130
it made me so nervous.

1665
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,360
Was it hanging off the ground or was it

1666
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,483
sound?

1667
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,380
I don't think maybe is the bones.

1668
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,210
I think it's just heavy bones as well.

1669
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,320
Dance Motherfucker,

1670
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,543
Dick Dude,

1671
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,450
pick boys.

1672
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,470
Legs were giant,

1673
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:04,160
but it was,

1674
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,170
there was a feeling of this very,

1675
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:06,501
you know,

1676
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,760
sometimes you hear someone or you see
someone kicked something or something and

1677
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:09,980
you go,

1678
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,161
oh,

1679
00:43:10,161 --> 00:43:12,220
I could never that no one gave that.

1680
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,190
You can't take that.

1681
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,750
Pedro had that you had that,

1682
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:15,501
you can't take that.

1683
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:17,840
He hit Rico Rodriguez
once and Rico was like,

1684
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:18,800
fuck this.

1685
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:20,090
I'm going down to check it out.

1686
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:20,631
He's like,

1687
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,530
I just tried to bring this guy in my Gar.

1688
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:23,811
You Man,

1689
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:23,890
I'm,

1690
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:24,723
I stand up with you.

1691
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,670
He hit him so hard that
Ricoh stayed on the outside,

1692
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,221
the whole fight.

1693
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:29,054
He never really,

1694
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:32,710
he never really completely committed
to trying to win the fight heavyweight.

1695
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:32,980
Right.

1696
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,960
That's the guy with the,

1697
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:34,190
um,

1698
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,510
the problem PD problem.

1699
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,620
The wrong guy.

1700
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,130
Rico,

1701
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,900
did people get popped for PE news?

1702
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:39,710
Maybe.

1703
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:40,011
I don't,

1704
00:43:40,011 --> 00:43:41,090
there's a documentary on them.

1705
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,391
No,

1706
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:41,661
no,

1707
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:41,901
no,

1708
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:42,110
no,

1709
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:42,321
no.

1710
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:43,580
You're thinking of Mark Carr.

1711
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,473
Uh,

1712
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:45,351
Rico.

1713
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:47,150
I don't think Rico got popped ever.

1714
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,740
But Rico was a Machado.

1715
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:50,250
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.

1716
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,410
Now heavyweight champion.

1717
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,580
I don't think I have an American wrestler.

1718
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,490
I think Tim Silvia beat him for the title.

1719
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:56,451
Tim Sylvia,

1720
00:43:56,451 --> 00:43:57,860
when he was at the top of his game,

1721
00:43:57,861 --> 00:43:58,760
he's a big giant,

1722
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,460
motherfuckers still fighting retired now.

1723
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,410
He bow hunts in Iowa.

1724
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:04,820
All giant now.

1725
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,330
Shit,

1726
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,630
he's 300 plus and he's
like six six foot nine.

1727
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:09,081
A huge,

1728
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:09,441
huge,

1729
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,161
huge person.

1730
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:10,430
Boy.

1731
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,121
I always looked at him.

1732
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:12,870
One thing I was just gumby,

1733
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:13,701
like a big guy,

1734
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:14,690
but he could fuck people up.

1735
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,390
Hey.

1736
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:15,770
Yeah,

1737
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,560
and he was like,

1738
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:18,270
you know,

1739
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:18,560
like,

1740
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:18,980
like we,

1741
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,020
we didn't get a baby giraffe
trying to figure out its steps,

1742
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,860
but he just knew how to move and
how to use it to his advantage.

1743
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:25,371
Well,

1744
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,170
if you go to the golden age of Tim Silvia,

1745
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,260
pull up Tim Silvia Kaos Rico Rodriguez.

1746
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,040
This is the golden of Tim Silvia.

1747
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,280
Back when Mexican supplements are easy
to come by and find out that the drug

1748
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:39,480
tests back then was like,

1749
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,690
they would like to make up,

1750
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,760
fill out a piece of paper.

1751
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,020
Tell me what drugs you

1752
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,280
passed the test.

1753
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,690
I wrote zero.

1754
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:50,971
It was fucking,

1755
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:51,840
everybody was on the,

1756
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,990
I want to see men with
all this stuff on PD,

1757
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:56,160
kind of talk for me.

1758
00:44:56,161 --> 00:44:58,910
I kind of thought yeah some people pause,

1759
00:44:59,220 --> 00:44:59,890
take steroids,

1760
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:00,211
whatever.

1761
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:01,560
But after I seen ICARUS,

1762
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,270
everyone's on steroids.

1763
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,680
Everyone in a lot of
broad holy shit the fuck.

1764
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:08,710
I was just like everyone not,

1765
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,120
but like there's the cheater are
always going to be a head of the,

1766
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,351
the solution.

1767
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:15,810
The guys were catching them
so whoever's on the new shit,

1768
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,720
they can't get caught just yet.

1769
00:45:17,721 --> 00:45:19,800
Or they update their testings.

1770
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:20,521
You know what I mean?

1771
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:24,510
So it's like I watched that and I realized
if you have the team behind you and

1772
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:25,590
you have people can fund it.

1773
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,950
Everyone's on steroids up.

1774
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,300
They hold their pis for a long time.

1775
00:45:30,301 --> 00:45:30,481
Right.

1776
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:31,950
Don't they hold your pissed
for like eight years.

1777
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,813
I told him just yeah,

1778
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,960
use it for research or whatever.

1779
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,231
Yeah.

1780
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,290
But I think they hold onto it just in
case new testing comes out so they can

1781
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:37,920
test it again.

1782
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,530
They took gold medals away
from two Russian cats.

1783
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,483
Oh yeah.

1784
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,910
Cause they went back and
with new testing found,

1785
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,430
I think they found EPO and their sisters.

1786
00:45:46,431 --> 00:45:47,264
Shit.

1787
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:47,800
Yeah.

1788
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,230
It's interesting.

1789
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,890
That documentary was amazed.

1790
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,880
Change my open my eyes and I had
a piss test the next day as well.

1791
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,230
I was like,

1792
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:55,350
yeah,

1793
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:55,900
I told the guy,

1794
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:55,940
oh,

1795
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,371
I've seen this.

1796
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:56,921
I saw this on,

1797
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:57,930
on the documentary last night.

1798
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,250
Like the Little Cup they were using.

1799
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:00,120
So yeah,

1800
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:00,953
I was like,

1801
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,160
who knows who on steroids when
you saw that came through,

1802
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,010
you know the guys that kind
of like their body's changed.

1803
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,650
Some of the people dropped off radically.

1804
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,170
Yeah,

1805
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:10,650
Greg,

1806
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,483
so quick,

1807
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:12,200
really quick.

1808
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:12,900
It's like,

1809
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,733
whoo.

1810
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,633
I never thought,

1811
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,730
not just changed,

1812
00:46:16,731 --> 00:46:19,680
but changed to the point where like
you're not even the same person.

1813
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:20,523
Yeah.

1814
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,440
And the guys in their 20s
doing an impression of who
they were just a couple of

1815
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,180
years ago in the sauce.

1816
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,013
Yeah.

1817
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:27,991
Shit's happening,

1818
00:46:27,991 --> 00:46:28,390
man.

1819
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,223
Everyone,

1820
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,653
I'm snitching.

1821
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:33,570
That's the golden snitch.

1822
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,873
He's a man.

1823
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,910
He sent it to me.

1824
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:37,470
He was texting me as well.

1825
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,110
Novitsky he's a good guy,

1826
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:40,620
man.

1827
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,160
He's just like,

1828
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,290
he's got a bad reputation
from a lot of people.

1829
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:43,471
Like,

1830
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:45,750
it'd be cool with them cause I
know me and I'm not cheating.

1831
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:47,970
I'm not a guy that never interested me.

1832
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,460
What is his official title?

1833
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:51,430
It's like athletes.

1834
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,510
Those cheat on wouldn't be hanging around
him like the why I would or wouldn't

1835
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,030
be as friendly with them because
they didn't want him sniffing around.

1836
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:57,871
You know what I'm saying?

1837
00:46:57,871 --> 00:47:00,330
He's there to make sure that someone
doesn't cheat on youtube though.

1838
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:01,680
100% I'm like please,

1839
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,140
I'm not mad at it.

1840
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,123
What's that?

1841
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:05,941
What does it say?

1842
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:06,774
The golden snitch.

1843
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,060
The golden snitch is the vice president
of athlete health and performance with

1844
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:18,894
the UFC

1845
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:22,703
made it

1846
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,003
golden.

1847
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:31,660
God Damn,

1848
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:32,320
that's funny.

1849
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:32,890
Yeah.

1850
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:33,400
Oh Shit,

1851
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,420
I'm glad he's around man.

1852
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:34,781
Honestly,

1853
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:38,090
cause you know you want out of mind
being an ambassador for the sport if it's

1854
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:39,250
not like a clean sport.

1855
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,570
Cause yeah,

1856
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:41,350
back in the day,

1857
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,170
even as early as 2010 hey
finding 12 Tim Silvia,

1858
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:46,420
Silvia Rica,

1859
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:46,880
Roger,

1860
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,410
but it's only on fight pass and I don't,

1861
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:49,303
that's it.

1862
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,380
I can't find it anywhere.

1863
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:51,430
Damn.

1864
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,410
He sounds just like the voice of
my own for a lot of different ways.

1865
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,200
It's weird like when you look
at him talking to us like,

1866
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,621
oh right,

1867
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:57,820
cause you heard about 20 times.

1868
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:58,181
Yeah,

1869
00:47:58,181 --> 00:47:58,391
I know.

1870
00:47:58,391 --> 00:47:59,224
It's weird being here.

1871
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,210
It's weird for me too man.

1872
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:01,470
Believe.

1873
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:01,950
Yeah,

1874
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:03,310
bro Freaks me out.

1875
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:06,700
I quit my job September 4th,

1876
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,080
2013 before I,

1877
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,090
before I quit that job.

1878
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,100
I think you are the first pause podcasts.

1879
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:13,570
I started listening to you
and I've got a few others,

1880
00:48:13,571 --> 00:48:14,404
like a uh,

1881
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,353
like a whole list.

1882
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,860
But I remember having those
my headphones in my ear,

1883
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:18,640
just one,

1884
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,310
so I could focus on the other things
that my boss would just ride me for so

1885
00:48:21,311 --> 00:48:21,551
long.

1886
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:23,410
Like just take that shit out.

1887
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:25,300
Your heirs [inaudible] music.

1888
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:25,571
I'm like,

1889
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:26,080
I'm not,

1890
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,920
I'm just trying to be entertained
so I didn't go postal and you niggas

1891
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:31,803
that it was just,

1892
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,580
you can enjoy what you do.

1893
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:34,510
Some people fly.

1894
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,291
When I was living in China,

1895
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,370
I knew a lot of guys that fought,

1896
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,270
but they didn't enjoy it.

1897
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,780
They just did it because it makes good
money and they get paid and I'm like,

1898
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:41,614
do something else.

1899
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:46,890
But for me doing that job only
shit soul sucking every single day,

1900
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:47,190
you know,

1901
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,350
you wake up train and then it was just
a block away and not walk to work.

1902
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,280
And I just knew I wasn't going to
get just written that day in men.

1903
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:59,310
But it's kind of crazy now I'm checking
in like I'm actually out here like I've

1904
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:01,330
listened to this for
so long and it's like,

1905
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,550
yeah I belong here now.

1906
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:04,270
Like it's weird.

1907
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,380
Everything just seems normal.

1908
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:06,151
Good,

1909
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:06,540
good.

1910
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,211
That's perfect.

1911
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:08,290
That means you hit the right time.

1912
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:08,450
Yeah,

1913
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:09,970
it means you got a good sense of timing.

1914
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:10,450
It's like,

1915
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,770
cause sometimes like
everything in my room,

1916
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:14,520
I had a nice suite for this
one shot to the UFC is that,

1917
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,800
that that made events that as,

1918
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:19,120
so I had like a nice little spot can
join the rooms with my teammates and

1919
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:21,760
sometimes I'll just overlook the
t-mobile arena and just be like,

1920
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,880
okay,

1921
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,601
like we were like,

1922
00:49:25,601 --> 00:49:26,081
we've made it,

1923
00:49:26,081 --> 00:49:26,610
we're out here.

1924
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:27,700
No we're not done yet.

1925
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:28,500
But like,

1926
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:28,860
yeah,

1927
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,680
shit,

1928
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,220
okay,

1929
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:30,850
let's go.

1930
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:31,930
And they just kinda checked back in.

1931
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,180
You're in the UFC.

1932
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,770
I mean you had to break into
the top 10 but that's fine.

1933
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:37,300
I don't think the rankings have come out.

1934
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:38,210
Fuck rankings man.

1935
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:38,771
Honestly,

1936
00:49:38,771 --> 00:49:40,510
like so stupid.

1937
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:42,070
They fucked up Paul Felder.

1938
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,440
Paul Felder would've got
that shot against Khabib.

1939
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,020
What does a welterweight,

1940
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:47,140
so it shouldn't even affect,

1941
00:49:47,141 --> 00:49:48,820
it shouldn't even affect
the lightweight ranking.

1942
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:49,300
No,

1943
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,530
that I'm not talking about that fight.

1944
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:52,030
I mean the reason why Paul Felder do,

1945
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,580
you didn't get that fight with Khabib
and Tony Ferguson hurt his knee,

1946
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,180
wouldn't recognize him.

1947
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,930
He's wasn't ranked in the top 10 they
wouldn't recognize him to be thought of in

1948
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,793
a great fight.

1949
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,451
Great fight.

1950
00:50:03,451 --> 00:50:07,720
But I Quintell was a fucking
flight and handle that well.

1951
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:10,810
But Paul Felder is a
big fucking lightweight.

1952
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:11,000
Yeah.

1953
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,710
And Paul Felder has outstanding striking
that there would be a real interesting

1954
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:16,810
fight percent so just cause the rankings.

1955
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,640
They didn't let that go
because the rankings,

1956
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:19,571
the rankings.

1957
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:20,410
That's one thing I want to know.

1958
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,570
Who decides what the like is it like,

1959
00:50:22,571 --> 00:50:22,750
uh,

1960
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:22,860
I,

1961
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:23,693
she called me for that.

1962
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:23,990
No,

1963
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,720
but like what have they done?

1964
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:26,800
What's their credentials?

1965
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:27,860
Where are they trained?

1966
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:31,430
Have they fought or they just like
analysts are they experts because it feels

1967
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:32,211
like if you want to be,

1968
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:33,560
instead of figuring out who did it,

1969
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:35,270
let's think about what
you would do differently.

1970
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:35,930
Like what,

1971
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,400
who do you think should be,

1972
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,190
who do you think should
be making the rankings?

1973
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,033
The rankings?

1974
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,480
Maybe x fighters,

1975
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,800
x fighters or like,

1976
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,190
um,

1977
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,210
someone who's been in the sport,

1978
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,100
someone who's trained.

1979
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:45,501
He sent me,

1980
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:45,821
like you said,

1981
00:50:45,821 --> 00:50:47,360
with judging someone who's actually like,

1982
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,020
and the,

1983
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,580
there's the shit out of me,

1984
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:53,000
man.

1985
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,410
After my,

1986
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:54,500
my second fight in the UFC,

1987
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:55,250
I fought in Glendale.

1988
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:55,520
Right?

1989
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,610
It was a split decision I got
in my head when they said,

1990
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,210
you know,

1991
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,770
Israel 50,

1992
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:01,370
whatever,

1993
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:01,491
oh,

1994
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:01,880
sorry,

1995
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,271
39,

1996
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,500
38 is at a Sonia.

1997
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,041
I was like,

1998
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:05,030
Oh fuck God.

1999
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,560
Just don't cause my wind bonus.

2000
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,730
I don't give a fuck about my record.

2001
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,181
I'm just like,

2002
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:09,590
don't fuck me out of my money.

2003
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:10,910
Don't fuck with my money.

2004
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:13,700
Like one other incompetent
judge and that would be knit.

2005
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:14,723
Yup.

2006
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,110
Yup.

2007
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,210
Only half my money and
that would piss me off.

2008
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:18,603
So crazy.

2009
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,860
What have you done to like how
the fuck did I lose that fight?

2010
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:22,540
In your eyes?

2011
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,580
It is of the biggest problems that
I thought the commissions have.

2012
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:26,870
Can't they just like,

2013
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,250
it seems like it's too much work.

2014
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,710
Like assuming that this should be
like a maybe a group chat like okay,

2015
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,600
let's change the 12 to
six Albo who's agreed?

2016
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:32,900
Yup.

2017
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,110
Yup,

2018
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:33,320
Yup,

2019
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:33,500
Yup.

2020
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:33,741
Yup.

2021
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:34,574
Cool.

2022
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:35,870
That's a no brainer.

2023
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,420
That one's the dumbest one of all time.

2024
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,151
What is it,

2025
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:40,490
why it takes so long to try and
make any change in the sport?

2026
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,121
Well,

2027
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:42,080
how about the way classes?

2028
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,130
Jesus,

2029
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:43,910
Kevin,

2030
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:47,660
Kevin Lee tweeted the other day that
there's something like 150 different

2031
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:52,220
fighters in between one 55 and one
70 or I think he said more than that.

2032
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,020
I said,

2033
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,670
what did he say about him almost dying?

2034
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:57,200
He felt like he was going to
die when those came weight.

2035
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,840
While definitely don't
[inaudible] 55 he that's scary.

2036
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:05,240
It is scary and you should be probably
fighting at one seven one 65 class.

2037
00:52:05,241 --> 00:52:06,074
I read on that tweet.

2038
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:06,410
Well,

2039
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,250
it's a good class.

2040
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:07,461
Yeah.

2041
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:12,461
She'd be 55657580590 five to 25 I
can do one 81 95 if that was me.

2042
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:16,780
I'll take that though.

2043
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,080
I'd be jumping between those two.

2044
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:18,461
Why not?

2045
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:19,730
I mean that's doable.

2046
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,080
I think the real problem is you give guys
like 85 two oh five that's 20 fucking

2047
00:52:24,081 --> 00:52:24,651
pounds,

2048
00:52:24,651 --> 00:52:24,831
man.

2049
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:25,760
That's a lot of weight.

2050
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:26,150
Yeah.

2051
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:27,940
I walk around to a five if I'm healthy.

2052
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:29,540
If from DC it out.

2053
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,830
Well that's good.

2054
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,600
That's a good amount of weight to cut.

2055
00:52:32,601 --> 00:52:33,111
Like I back.

2056
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:34,160
When you get real lean,

2057
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:37,130
you'll probably lose like six seven
and you're only losing really cutting.

2058
00:52:37,131 --> 00:52:39,050
Like what 10 this is camp.

2059
00:52:39,051 --> 00:52:39,720
I didn't use a song.

2060
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,970
I didn't use a bath for this fight.

2061
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,510
Nice.

2062
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,960
Normally like the last two I did and I
was underweight just and I was only cut a

2063
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:45,561
little bit as well,

2064
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:46,750
but this one I woke up on.

2065
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,240
Wait.

2066
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,710
Do you use an expert to help you?

2067
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:49,700
Like a Lockhart or something?

2068
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:52,730
I'm gunna maybe for the fight week.

2069
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,990
Use Lockhart next time maybe.

2070
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:55,190
But like normally I just,

2071
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:55,451
I,

2072
00:52:55,451 --> 00:52:56,540
I've done this for a long time,

2073
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:56,900
so my,

2074
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,950
I know my body and I'm
always accurate as well.

2075
00:52:58,950 --> 00:52:59,371
I can feel like,

2076
00:52:59,371 --> 00:52:59,471
man,

2077
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:02,120
I'm about 98 kg or 93 kg.

2078
00:53:02,121 --> 00:53:02,351
Sit down.

2079
00:53:02,351 --> 00:53:03,320
I'm about 85.

2080
00:53:03,321 --> 00:53:04,154
Katie's right.

2081
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,410
Rehydration Lockhart method,

2082
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:07,060
the old one.

2083
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:07,610
Um,

2084
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:12,310
there's a whole system like with the
waxy maize amino acids eating pineapples

2085
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,910
with crackers and honey and whatnot.

2086
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:17,120
So I follow the list and my coach
pineapples with cracker and honey.

2087
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,740
I don't know,

2088
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,401
it's on the list.

2089
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:20,240
It's a lock hard one.

2090
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:20,900
That's a,

2091
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,560
yeah,

2092
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,470
it's like carbohydrates from the crackers
and the honey talking to the wrong

2093
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:26,304
guy.

2094
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:27,900
I would know what that kind of stuff.

2095
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:28,261
Like for me,

2096
00:53:28,261 --> 00:53:28,890
I just,

2097
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:29,380
that's the thing.

2098
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,240
I have guys like Mike,

2099
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:31,620
my coach or Eugene who knows why,

2100
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:32,250
you know,

2101
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,690
and he'll just tell me do this.

2102
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:34,524
And I trust them.

2103
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:35,493
Yeah,

2104
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,490
I know it's a la carte method and they've
updated it because I talked to Ian and

2105
00:53:38,491 --> 00:53:39,360
he said that was the old one.

2106
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,800
I sent it to him and he
said they've updated it.

2107
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:41,161
So I said,

2108
00:53:41,161 --> 00:53:41,850
okay,

2109
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,250
next time probably I'll use them to,

2110
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,540
for the fight week,

2111
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:45,871
wait,

2112
00:53:45,871 --> 00:53:46,170
cut.

2113
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:47,220
And then the rehydration,

2114
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,980
I'll try the toughest you've ever cut.

2115
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,800
Like how have you ever gotten,

2116
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:52,703
let me go back.

2117
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:53,520
Go back.

2118
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,300
Uh,

2119
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,980
this is probably early on in my career.

2120
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:57,211
No,

2121
00:53:57,211 --> 00:53:58,830
actually there was one in
China where I fucked up.

2122
00:53:59,070 --> 00:53:59,903
I was fucking around.

2123
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,160
I'm at the buffet or something,

2124
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,340
maybe like the fight week.

2125
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:06,930
And then I think I cut
four cages in the sauna.

2126
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,480
It was easy on the last one.

2127
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:12,270
But before that I was just like
mentally sitting there like,

2128
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:13,104
shit,

2129
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,070
never again.

2130
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,540
I'm never doing this again.

2131
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:17,110
And I start to like
visualize the fight line.

2132
00:54:17,111 --> 00:54:19,950
I'm gonna make this guy pay and I
start to get delusional and delirious.

2133
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:20,581
But yeah,

2134
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:21,690
for Katie is not bad.

2135
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:22,261
I've heard worse.

2136
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:24,240
I've heard like six kgs in a,

2137
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:24,900
in a sauna,

2138
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,020
and that's a lot on like someone who's
not even that fat or that [inaudible]

2139
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,600
1314 pounds.

2140
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:31,460
How many of you in kgs?

2141
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,280
Dammit,

2142
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:32,581
I know.

2143
00:54:32,581 --> 00:54:33,414
Pounds.

2144
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,490
How many pounds is that?

2145
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,043
14 yeah.

2146
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:37,591
Yeah.

2147
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:38,424
That's a lot.

2148
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:39,263
30 pounds.

2149
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,110
2.2 so,

2150
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:40,711
Oh God,

2151
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:41,071
that's right.

2152
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:43,200
I'm going the wrong way
and going the wrong way.

2153
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:45,121
Oh,

2154
00:54:45,121 --> 00:54:45,954
here it is.

2155
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,880
As you get closer to the

2156
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:47,591
Wayne's,

2157
00:54:47,591 --> 00:54:50,500
we cut back on the fat and start
incorporating frozen fruits.

2158
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:50,981
Interesting.

2159
00:54:50,981 --> 00:54:52,690
Something I use a lot is pineapple.

2160
00:54:52,691 --> 00:54:55,630
The reason is dietary
fiber will hold water.

2161
00:54:55,631 --> 00:55:00,190
If I put a bunch of water into a bowl
and let us let us Brown and wilted the

2162
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:00,191
next day,

2163
00:55:00,191 --> 00:55:02,200
resorbed the water via a
small cyst would be good.

2164
00:55:02,201 --> 00:55:02,741
Lettuce again.

2165
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:02,921
Well,

2166
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:03,754
I didn't know that.

2167
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,470
When you guys are near the
end of your weight class,

2168
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,200
they are cutting back on how much water
they take in so they don't have to worry

2169
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:09,670
about the body absorbing the water.

2170
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,470
That means we can give them fruit,

2171
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:12,161
the fruit,

2172
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:13,870
which is going to help
them fuel the brain.

2173
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:14,853
Interesting.

2174
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,460
Hmm.

2175
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,080
Yeah that interesting.

2176
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:18,940
Huh?

2177
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,230
Now what kind of shit do you eat?

2178
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,260
Like are you on a very specific
diet or a sea food and I eat it.

2179
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,070
I like food.

2180
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:24,903
I'm hungry.

2181
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:25,570
My bed,

2182
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,980
the best thing is like for me,

2183
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:28,300
it's weird when you're not allowed it.

2184
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,283
You want it more?

2185
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:30,383
Yeah.

2186
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:34,900
Like fight week when I get here and I
started to like crave just the good stuff

2187
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:38,320
and I go on these Instagram pages like
tasty and I used to wash and I save it

2188
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,670
and I write down when I'm going to get,

2189
00:55:39,671 --> 00:55:40,480
when I get back home.

2190
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,580
And then it's like food porn for real.

2191
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:43,790
Yeah.

2192
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,610
Just thinking about it.

2193
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:45,760
Oh my God.

2194
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,590
And then after the fight,

2195
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:48,460
once it's time to weigh in,

2196
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,900
I'm good and I'm just like all right,

2197
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:50,883
eat healthy,

2198
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:51,461
get it done.

2199
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:52,800
I don't like pig out like even on the,

2200
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,800
the one I get I'll go from Lockhart says
do not eat pasta until after the fight.

2201
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,140
Cause apparently that
can still be no pasta.

2202
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:00,940
Capital letters do not.

2203
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:04,420
What about like maybe a keen
want pasta or lentil pasta?

2204
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,651
That'd be better.

2205
00:56:05,651 --> 00:56:06,790
I think just like regular lanes.

2206
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:07,121
Yeah.

2207
00:56:07,121 --> 00:56:08,810
I think just like maybe pastry pastor,

2208
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:09,400
that kind of stuff.

2209
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,790
[inaudible] Pasta,

2210
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:11,020
not,

2211
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:11,230
yeah,

2212
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,280
I liked that one thing.

2213
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:13,143
Do you have any elk?

2214
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:14,230
Yes sir.

2215
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:14,490
Yeah.

2216
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:18,490
Come get here for a go to spot til
Thursday is can you have a place where you

2217
00:56:18,491 --> 00:56:19,110
can cook?

2218
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:19,631
Oh Dude,

2219
00:56:19,631 --> 00:56:20,464
I got you.

2220
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:22,263
Yeah.

2221
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,980
The thing I'll give you is

2222
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,120
I'll give you some elk sausage.

2223
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:28,760
That's the easiest to cook and I'll give
you some directions and I'll give you

2224
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:30,550
an elk stake direction.

2225
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,350
Do you have access to like a a like
some sort of a a grill with a lid on it?

2226
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,940
We can get a temperature control grill.

2227
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:37,750
A barbecue grill.

2228
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:38,171
Yeah.

2229
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:38,520
We've got one.

2230
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,430
As long as you get,

2231
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:42,160
you just want to make sure and you've
got to get a digital thermometer.

2232
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:44,610
You want to make sure the meat
stays somewhat temperature.

2233
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:45,071
Yeah,

2234
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:45,910
you don't want to keep it.

2235
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,090
You definitely don't want
to Cook it past 120 degrees.

2236
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:50,710
Easy to follow instructions.

2237
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:51,560
Okay.

2238
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,121
I'm coachable.

2239
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:52,571
I'm coachable.

2240
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:53,404
I know you are,

2241
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,410
but you know you can't learn on your own.

2242
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,210
I'm going to be so both.

2243
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,630
The thing about a guy like you that's
interesting to me is like it's very

2244
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:05,410
obvious that you have very good technical
training but then you deviated and you

2245
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:07,990
figured out your own creative path
and something you said earlier,

2246
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:11,260
which I think is really important and
it's a good thing to hear for people who

2247
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,650
don't really understand martial arts
is what you do really is an art.

2248
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,420
I mean you're expressing yourself,

2249
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,493
you know there's something,

2250
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:22,420
and for a person like me who's a fan of
that martial art and I understand what

2251
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:22,901
you're doing,

2252
00:57:22,901 --> 00:57:25,060
I watch it and I'm appreciating it.

2253
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:28,090
It's like I'm watching ballet or symphony,

2254
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:29,080
I'm watching art.

2255
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:29,350
I'm like,

2256
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,430
oh look how he's set up.

2257
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:34,720
There was one time when you trapped his
trapped his wrist and cracked him on the

2258
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:39,721
elbow and I didn't know what that is is
that's like almost like NLP because some

2259
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:42,190
people will use things coming
at them at a certain speed,

2260
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,031
none that pop.

2261
00:57:43,031 --> 00:57:43,571
So what I did,

2262
00:57:43,571 --> 00:57:44,950
like he had his guard
up and I was just like,

2263
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,210
just give me a hand and I
just hit him with a food.

2264
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,320
So like he gave you watch it.

2265
00:57:50,321 --> 00:57:51,154
He kind of like just,

2266
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,290
well he thought you were
going at a slow speed.

2267
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,470
He sped up because I'm used to,

2268
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:55,660
you know,

2269
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,540
he's used to the fast they
can run them and I was like,

2270
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:58,374
oh just give me your head.

2271
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,310
Well that's the change up in baseball.

2272
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:01,870
They throw a slow pitch and you're like,

2273
00:58:01,871 --> 00:58:02,500
what is this?

2274
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,460
And you with it and you're like,

2275
00:58:03,461 --> 00:58:03,821
fuck,

2276
00:58:03,821 --> 00:58:04,654
how did I miss that?

2277
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,820
Because you are expecting
a ball to be so fast.

2278
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,030
I've heard the term before but I've never,

2279
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:08,883
I don't know,

2280
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,820
change up.

2281
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,370
So if a guy throws like a
98 mile an hour fastball,

2282
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,710
it all of a sudden he throws one
that's like a fraction of that.

2283
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,800
I don't know what fraction baseball,

2284
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:17,250
right.

2285
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,280
Swing too quick or something.

2286
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:18,491
Yeah,

2287
00:58:18,491 --> 00:58:19,181
they swing too quick.

2288
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:20,350
Will it be a changeup pitch?

2289
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,640
Like how much slower would it be?

2290
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:22,990
20 or 30 miles an hour slower?

2291
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:24,000
Yeah.

2292
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:24,281
Yeah.

2293
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:25,540
So if fucks your head up,

2294
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:26,080
man,

2295
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,560
you're expecting that
ball that comes through.

2296
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,660
You see him throw it.

2297
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:30,443
Yeah.

2298
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:33,100
And then he fucking hasn't
even gotten there yet.

2299
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,260
Deception.

2300
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,093
That's what it is bro.

2301
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:39,850
Like damages deception because
the ultimate deception,

2302
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,750
I go a few more.

2303
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,460
That's this the basic one I use,

2304
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:43,270
but I got to,

2305
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,290
I try one on him.

2306
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,031
You might catch it.

2307
00:58:45,031 --> 00:58:47,830
It was a change up from a
left kick to a front teeth,

2308
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,630
but it just went right.

2309
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:50,563
It was right there.

2310
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:51,920
We see the highlight.

2311
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:52,691
Ooh,

2312
00:58:52,691 --> 00:58:53,524
that was pretty,

2313
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:57,280
you know another one that
you see Wonderboy likes to
use is that front leg side

2314
00:58:57,281 --> 00:58:57,880
kick,

2315
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,000
roundhouse kick combination.

2316
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:02,740
He comes in and touches you with the
front leg side kick and then Saul swap.

2317
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:03,863
Yeah.

2318
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:08,080
Raymond Daniels though has the prettiest
version of that jumping sidekick

2319
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,160
spinning back kick to the
face that he didn't glory,

2320
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,280
that they'll sick.

2321
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,610
I mean that guy did the splits.

2322
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,400
Woo.

2323
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:13,620
Damn.

2324
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:18,070
That was a guy who can do that in a
kickboxing match and a very high level.

2325
00:59:18,071 --> 00:59:19,090
That's when you realize like,

2326
00:59:19,091 --> 00:59:19,361
Whoa,

2327
00:59:19,361 --> 00:59:19,871
this guy,

2328
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:21,750
like you can't give him any road.

2329
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,030
Yeah,

2330
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:26,180
100% well that's why face
Joseph Valtellina and Nikki
halts can when they fought

2331
00:59:26,181 --> 00:59:26,451
him though.

2332
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:26,730
It's sure.

2333
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:27,470
Interesting.

2334
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,640
Constant pressure in leg kicks,

2335
00:59:28,641 --> 00:59:29,480
chopping that leg,

2336
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:30,171
chopping that leg,

2337
00:59:30,171 --> 00:59:31,004
chopping that leg.

2338
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,360
You know what I like about your style is
you basically do both of those things.

2339
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,600
You do the wild crazy shit but you also
do technical Moitai cause what I mean

2340
00:59:40,871 --> 00:59:42,790
about I kept on standing by
you or I'll be in a book,

2341
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,260
but button basher like you know when you
play Tekken and you just kind of like

2342
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:46,131
play into hope,

2343
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:46,964
something cool happens.

2344
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,081
That's what he does.

2345
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:50,390
And I'm like established
your basics first.

2346
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,830
Established Your Foundation,

2347
00:59:51,831 --> 00:59:52,700
Land Your Jab.

2348
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:53,780
He did it in this last fight,

2349
00:59:53,781 --> 00:59:57,980
but like normally established something
first and then the f the cool shit comes

2350
00:59:57,981 --> 00:59:58,431
afterwards.

2351
00:59:58,431 --> 00:59:59,031
You can't just like,

2352
00:59:59,031 --> 00:59:59,231
and he's,

2353
00:59:59,231 --> 01:00:01,280
he's had success with knocked
out gay God with the spinning.

2354
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:01,821
I'm jumping,

2355
01:00:01,821 --> 01:00:02,654
spinning back kick,

2356
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:03,200
you know.

2357
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,520
But like I think you'd have better
success at letting those things if you

2358
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,860
establish your basics first land your jab,

2359
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:10,610
set the pace.

2360
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:13,400
He was landing a lot of jobs and that
fight in that last close to it was just

2361
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,230
constant relentless with it's pressure.

2362
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,940
I think I called it two
minutes before it happened.

2363
01:00:16,941 --> 01:00:17,211
I was like,

2364
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:18,044
I told Ash,

2365
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:18,520
um,

2366
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:18,831
my,

2367
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:19,900
a friend of mine was like,

2368
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:22,220
he's phase phase and
he's going to go soon.

2369
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,083
He's going soon.

2370
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,530
You can just see it
when he starts to like,

2371
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,330
and maybe cause I see it,

2372
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,760
that's what I look for in a guy or
they tell me like I'm ready to go.

2373
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:29,001
I'm like,

2374
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:29,211
all right,

2375
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:29,720
cool.

2376
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,553
I hope you're out.

2377
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,583
I was taking them out.

2378
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:33,620
You can just find it like that.

2379
01:00:33,621 --> 01:00:35,200
You look in their eyes
when he killed them.

2380
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,010
When you see guys starting to crack,

2381
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,910
you feel them.

2382
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:39,021
You feel them?

2383
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:39,591
Well yeah.

2384
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:41,060
You feel it's an energy.

2385
01:00:41,061 --> 01:00:41,894
It's the energy.

2386
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,090
Like just see dressed.

2387
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:43,850
Yeah.

2388
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:44,361
And he's okay.

2389
01:00:44,361 --> 01:00:44,901
He's ready to go.

2390
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:45,381
Like example,

2391
01:00:45,381 --> 01:00:46,930
my first flight shots or Rob Wilkinson,

2392
01:00:46,931 --> 01:00:48,500
I actually brought him
in just to help me out.

2393
01:00:48,501 --> 01:00:49,221
Not for this camp,

2394
01:00:49,221 --> 01:00:50,810
just before his wrestling pressure.

2395
01:00:50,811 --> 01:00:51,440
Rob Wilkinson,

2396
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,273
he's a good guy.

2397
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,540
He's my first UFC fight.

2398
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:54,440
But when I was fighting him,

2399
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:58,550
it was in the second round after his
last take down attempt and then I like

2400
01:00:59,090 --> 01:00:59,923
stuffed his head,

2401
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:01,910
got my leg out and let's
get back to the middle.

2402
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:06,380
And I saw him walk back like
circle and just the body language.

2403
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:06,800
I was like,

2404
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:06,951
oh,

2405
01:01:06,951 --> 01:01:07,371
you're ready.

2406
01:01:07,371 --> 01:01:08,660
Not Throw my hands up like what's up?

2407
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,550
And then pop me a poem and I just
Kinda like just pick them apart slowly.

2408
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:14,240
I didn't rush it.

2409
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,290
Like I keep telling,

2410
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:16,580
I don't rush these knockouts.

2411
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:17,300
Like a lot of people were like,

2412
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:17,451
oh,

2413
01:01:17,451 --> 01:01:19,010
he hurt Brad about three times,

2414
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:20,060
but you know,

2415
01:01:20,061 --> 01:01:21,080
he didn't go for the finish.

2416
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:21,914
I'm like,

2417
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:23,510
I'm not trying to bum rush these days.

2418
01:01:23,511 --> 01:01:24,410
I just picked them apart.

2419
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,460
They will fall eventually.

2420
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,390
Well not only that,

2421
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,060
but here's something to
consider for people that don't,

2422
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,520
don't really totally
understand what you're doing.

2423
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:34,280
You're doing everything correctly and
you're not really getting hit much.

2424
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:34,630
No,

2425
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:34,850
you,

2426
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,050
you're doing everything correctly.

2427
01:01:36,051 --> 01:01:37,400
And by doing everything correctly,

2428
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,500
you're kind of ensuring to continue your,

2429
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:42,650
your domination in that fight
versus put yourself in danger.

2430
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,990
Which some people like some people like
I like the fight down on her mouthpiece

2431
01:01:45,991 --> 01:01:46,371
and bang.

2432
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:47,200
I love me adjusting,

2433
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,110
gauging Michael Johnson,

2434
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,170
but I'm not going to be that guy.

2435
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:53,120
I'm not going to be that guy because
I'm not here for a long time.

2436
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:53,930
I'm here for a good time.

2437
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:56,510
I just want to keep my wits
about me like Mayweather,

2438
01:01:56,511 --> 01:01:56,881
get in,

2439
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:57,350
get out,

2440
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,430
making money and fuck off.

2441
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,293
That's what I want to do.

2442
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:03,560
You're finding correctly in terms of like
if you're trying to teach someone how

2443
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:04,700
to hit and not get hit,

2444
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:05,690
you're fighting correctly,

2445
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,300
but in order to push further,

2446
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:11,330
if you were trying to make it
more exciting and engage more,

2447
01:02:11,331 --> 01:02:14,360
you have to risk getting hit and
that's not a wise thing to do.

2448
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:15,170
I take risks,

2449
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:18,110
I like to take risks and
when I play with my distance,

2450
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:18,441
okay,

2451
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:20,430
am I too close my too far and I,

2452
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,110
before I take those risks,

2453
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:22,711
I calculate,

2454
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:23,940
I know what he's going to do already.

2455
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:24,480
I'm like,

2456
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,590
I can bait them with something,

2457
01:02:25,591 --> 01:02:27,570
like if I want them to jab now,

2458
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:29,670
get closer and when he
jabs I slipped and rip.

2459
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:30,803
You know what I mean?

2460
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:31,501
So you just,

2461
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:34,350
I take a risk by calculating my risk and
sometimes I'm might do some wild shit

2462
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:34,660
like that.

2463
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,493
Have a narrow,

2464
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:36,750
yeah,

2465
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,730
I fucked up on that one cause
it was a little bit slippery.

2466
01:02:38,731 --> 01:02:40,410
And I uh,

2467
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,640
I landed in training.

2468
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:41,831
I've,

2469
01:02:41,831 --> 01:02:41,970
I've,

2470
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:42,870
I catch it all the time,

2471
01:02:42,871 --> 01:02:46,360
but I didn't account for the sweat on
his legs and I got back up anyway and I

2472
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:46,621
was like,

2473
01:02:46,621 --> 01:02:47,454
come on.

2474
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,180
It was a good one,

2475
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:48,600
you know,

2476
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,100
but it's a crazy thing to do.

2477
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:52,800
You're also very honest when
things don't go your way.

2478
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:53,040
Yeah.

2479
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,030
And then things go wrong.

2480
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:55,650
You had a kickboxing fight.

2481
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:56,484
Was it in glory?

2482
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:56,750
Yeah,

2483
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:57,000
no,

2484
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,370
that was the one in Brazil.

2485
01:02:58,371 --> 01:02:58,540
What's,

2486
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:58,890
uh,

2487
01:02:58,890 --> 01:02:59,640
what's his name?

2488
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,450
Alex.

2489
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,283
Yeah.

2490
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,520
Per area where you lost and you were
talking about what it was like to get

2491
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:06,110
knocked out.

2492
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:06,330
Yeah.

2493
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:08,340
For me that's everyone's worst fear.

2494
01:03:08,341 --> 01:03:10,770
So that for me was to
first for the first time,

2495
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:14,760
my first back to back lost cause that
was just after the glorified and my first

2496
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:15,594
knockout loss.

2497
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:19,110
Although you lost a lot of people
thought you should won the decision.

2498
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,070
I won the fight.

2499
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:20,700
You know,

2500
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,290
you look at it,

2501
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:22,890
oh well I don't even base it on that.

2502
01:03:22,891 --> 01:03:24,690
But like we both knew like,

2503
01:03:24,691 --> 01:03:25,950
I hit you more than you hit me,

2504
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:26,460
you know?

2505
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:26,910
Yeah.

2506
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:27,271
He was like,

2507
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:29,940
well he had the pressure and he
walked you down in the commentary.

2508
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,180
Being honest was bullshit because I mean
respect to a guy like val to leave me,

2509
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:34,801
but he never,

2510
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:36,060
he can't fight like me.

2511
01:03:36,061 --> 01:03:37,380
He can't understand my style,

2512
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:37,951
his fight.

2513
01:03:37,951 --> 01:03:38,671
You look at his career,

2514
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:40,140
he has to take time off because of,

2515
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:40,860
you know,

2516
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,370
trauma,

2517
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:42,210
because that's how we fight.

2518
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:44,400
So he appreciates that kind of style.

2519
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:46,050
But what's his name?

2520
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:46,321
Uh,

2521
01:03:46,321 --> 01:03:46,711
wellness.

2522
01:03:46,711 --> 01:03:47,371
Walk me down,

2523
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:50,460
but he really couldn't do shit leg
kicks as opposed to slow you down.

2524
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:51,420
I didn't slow down.

2525
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,220
I was still dancing around
them in the fifth round.

2526
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,330
I was slipping and stuff.

2527
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:55,410
I was fresh.

2528
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:55,681
You know,

2529
01:03:55,681 --> 01:03:56,700
but yeah,

2530
01:03:56,701 --> 01:03:57,534
that fight,

2531
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:58,800
I felt like I won that fight,

2532
01:03:58,801 --> 01:03:59,400
but it's all right.

2533
01:03:59,400 --> 01:03:59,620
So,

2534
01:03:59,620 --> 01:03:59,791
you know,

2535
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:00,481
it wasn't meant to be,

2536
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:01,670
everything happens the way
it's supposed to happen.

2537
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,960
I wasn't supposed to get that
belt and I'm okay with it.

2538
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:04,950
Yeah.

2539
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:06,570
Well the fight was the fight.

2540
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:07,531
Exactly.

2541
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:08,361
Really was just a,

2542
01:04:08,361 --> 01:04:11,610
the judges that people have a dispute
with the actual fight was a successful

2543
01:04:11,611 --> 01:04:14,100
fight for you and that you did
land more shots than he did,

2544
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,510
but then losing the next fight by Kao and,

2545
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,840
but you talked about it online,

2546
01:04:18,841 --> 01:04:21,840
like you were real open about it on
Instagram and because that's the fair,

2547
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:22,591
like every fighter,

2548
01:04:22,591 --> 01:04:25,800
like if it was just me and
a guy fighting and I lost,

2549
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:26,001
it's like,

2550
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:26,130
oh,

2551
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:26,880
whatever.

2552
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,230
But when you put it in front of,

2553
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:28,680
you know,

2554
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:29,520
millions of people,

2555
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,421
that's the fair.

2556
01:04:30,421 --> 01:04:30,660
It's like,

2557
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:30,990
Oh shit,

2558
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:33,060
I don't want to look like shit
in front of all these people.

2559
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:33,983
What did you get hit with?

2560
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:34,680
Um,

2561
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:35,200
I was,

2562
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,840
south port was a l a left hook from him
and before that first round I tee them

2563
01:04:39,841 --> 01:04:41,310
up second round.

2564
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,420
I rocked him within from
that wellness fight.

2565
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,130
I let some bull shit
get to me just online.

2566
01:04:47,131 --> 01:04:47,281
You know,

2567
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:49,690
like people in your life is looking
different like people in your license.

2568
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:50,563
Amen.

2569
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:52,470
He should have won that fight,

2570
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:53,304
blah blah blah blah.

2571
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:53,551
Okay.

2572
01:04:53,551 --> 01:04:55,020
She shouldn't leave it
in the judge's hands,

2573
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:55,651
you know,

2574
01:04:55,651 --> 01:04:57,510
they'll say some shit like that
and it just seeps into you.

2575
01:04:57,511 --> 01:04:59,100
So when I heard him in that second round,

2576
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:03,340
I just went berserk what people expect
me to do and what people in the UFC do.

2577
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,730
Just like Isiah throwing
bombs and just like I was,

2578
01:05:05,731 --> 01:05:05,851
no,

2579
01:05:05,851 --> 01:05:06,810
I was only throwing right hands.

2580
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,250
I just thought only right hands at him.

2581
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,050
And I watched that fight back.

2582
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:11,370
I haven't watched it in a long time,

2583
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:12,300
but when I watched it back I was like,

2584
01:05:12,301 --> 01:05:13,021
why are you doing this?

2585
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:13,591
Because that's not me.

2586
01:05:13,591 --> 01:05:15,420
That's not me staying true to myself.

2587
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:15,901
Well,

2588
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:17,190
I would've done if I was,

2589
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:17,950
you know,

2590
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,030
being true to myself is just,

2591
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:19,331
all right,

2592
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:19,840
cool.

2593
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:20,620
Where's the shot?

2594
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:21,760
Bomb pop home.

2595
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:22,863
Just pick him up.

2596
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:24,551
He was hurt.

2597
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:25,840
He was out on his feet already.

2598
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,130
So it's a good story for him.

2599
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:27,341
You know,

2600
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:31,120
like he knocked me out at the third
round after he got in the second round.

2601
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:32,111
But I mean,

2602
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:32,410
yeah,

2603
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:33,101
it was good for him.

2604
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:33,521
But Hey,

2605
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:34,271
if we fight again,

2606
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:36,430
because even after my first my UFC debut,

2607
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:37,780
he put like a contract up.

2608
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:38,950
Like he's coming to the UFC as well.

2609
01:05:38,951 --> 01:05:39,181
I'm like,

2610
01:05:39,181 --> 01:05:40,014
all right,

2611
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:40,863
make your way up.

2612
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,150
I'll fuck him up 100%.

2613
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,780
He's a very good kickboxer too.

2614
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,833
I mean he

2615
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:50,560
beat me twice and the first
time as well was another weird,

2616
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:51,220
you know,

2617
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:52,280
he's walking forward and you know,

2618
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:53,591
not landing shorts,

2619
01:05:53,591 --> 01:05:57,100
but I'm moving back and hitting them
the whole time and the judges gave it to

2620
01:05:57,101 --> 01:05:57,281
him,

2621
01:05:57,281 --> 01:05:57,940
so I was like,

2622
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:58,773
credit to you,

2623
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,590
you got to fight.

2624
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:00,401
I'll fight you again.

2625
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:02,410
So if he makes his way to the UFC,

2626
01:06:02,411 --> 01:06:03,850
you can get it anytime.

2627
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,950
Is he trying to fight MMA now or is he,

2628
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,580
I think he hasn't.

2629
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:07,720
He's had MMA fights he's had,

2630
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:08,261
it may fights,

2631
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:09,490
but a lot of kickbox is,

2632
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:09,941
like I said,

2633
01:06:09,941 --> 01:06:10,541
my boy Brian,

2634
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:12,670
even he realizes like
MMA is where it's at.

2635
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:13,031
You know,

2636
01:06:13,031 --> 01:06:13,661
the UFC,

2637
01:06:13,661 --> 01:06:17,710
they see the way best run
company I've ever come across.

2638
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:19,090
I fall around the world for,

2639
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:19,690
for glory,

2640
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:20,523
for in China.

2641
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,330
No one runs the show like the UFC.

2642
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:27,280
Like everything has a place in the time
and it's just so clean and you get your

2643
01:06:27,281 --> 01:06:27,701
money quick.

2644
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:28,061
That's one thing.

2645
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:28,894
I like it.

2646
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:30,260
Fuck,

2647
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,550
it's a well oiled machine.

2648
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:32,710
Definitely mean they've,

2649
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:36,650
they've been running it that way since
2002 and now the new organization is

2650
01:06:36,651 --> 01:06:38,510
basically like most of
the old organization.

2651
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,373
Yeah.

2652
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:39,890
Yeah.

2653
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:41,090
It's nice to work for a man.

2654
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,770
I still enjoy it after all these years.

2655
01:06:42,771 --> 01:06:43,401
Like the next one.

2656
01:06:43,401 --> 01:06:44,091
The next one's in La,

2657
01:06:44,091 --> 01:06:44,830
right?

2658
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:45,663
Yup.

2659
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:47,110
TJ versus Cody.

2660
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,980
We magnify a fuck that first fight,

2661
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:52,743
uh,

2662
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:55,430
after the last Robert Whittaker,

2663
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:55,710
uh,

2664
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:59,270
Yo over Merrill fight that your weight
class is kind of in this weird state.

2665
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,201
I mean,

2666
01:07:00,201 --> 01:07:00,650
um,

2667
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:01,280
what do you mean?

2668
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:01,800
Well,

2669
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,240
it's,

2670
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,980
Whitaker won the fight.

2671
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:04,760
Um,

2672
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:08,600
but a lot of people thought Ramiro might
have gotten the nod because he knocked

2673
01:07:08,601 --> 01:07:10,940
him down and hurt him and then he
heard him again and the next round.

2674
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,360
A lot of people thought at the very least
it was a draw because if you look at

2675
01:07:14,361 --> 01:07:15,194
them on paper,

2676
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:17,390
Whitaker never really hurt my Merrill,

2677
01:07:17,391 --> 01:07:19,480
but Romero did significantly hurt.

2678
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:19,850
Hurt him.

2679
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:20,900
Whitaker twice.

2680
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:21,560
Yeah,

2681
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,560
and you know he came off
of knocking out rock,

2682
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:25,010
but then again he didn't miss wait,

2683
01:07:25,011 --> 01:07:26,390
so that kind of puts it out for me.

2684
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:27,590
I really care.

2685
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:28,910
As long as he's moving up,

2686
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:29,720
I think,

2687
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,220
I think he said he's going
to go to light heavyweight.

2688
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:31,551
Yeah,

2689
01:07:31,551 --> 01:07:33,170
I think that's the most recent.

2690
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:34,603
How tall is he?

2691
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,990
Tall Dude.

2692
01:07:35,991 --> 01:07:38,490
That guy is built like a brick shit house.

2693
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:39,430
Looks like an action figure.

2694
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:43,430
When he came in here and do a
podcast while I was in camp,

2695
01:07:43,431 --> 01:07:45,770
you know him and Joey
Diaz translated and shit.

2696
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:47,040
I was looking at my keys,

2697
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,320
230 pounds.

2698
01:07:48,321 --> 01:07:49,250
He's fucking huge.

2699
01:07:49,251 --> 01:07:52,590
How's he going to make one 85 that's how
I felt when I first met Anthony Johnson

2700
01:07:52,591 --> 01:07:53,420
and I was like,

2701
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,050
yeah,

2702
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:55,770
why the fuck fuck.

2703
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:57,381
I literally,

2704
01:07:57,381 --> 01:07:57,751
I saw him,

2705
01:07:57,751 --> 01:07:59,210
he's just like a thick burger,

2706
01:07:59,211 --> 01:08:01,490
like huge and he you didn't want,

2707
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:02,720
he hit me once.

2708
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,220
I think when it was only once,

2709
01:08:04,221 --> 01:08:05,780
like a clean one and I was like,

2710
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:07,250
I'm not getting hit by that again.

2711
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,670
Is it 100% it was good work.

2712
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:11,331
I enjoyed the work.

2713
01:08:11,331 --> 01:08:11,901
We'd go out together,

2714
01:08:11,901 --> 01:08:14,630
but definitely you to get hit spar
or well he's called light with,

2715
01:08:14,631 --> 01:08:15,410
you know,

2716
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:16,243
he

2717
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:17,960
was the guy that brought
in front of mess up.

2718
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:18,920
But yeah,

2719
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:19,251
it wasn't,

2720
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:20,090
I didn't let it happen.

2721
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:20,970
Ooh,

2722
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:23,000
how's making sure like
nuts stay away from that,

2723
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:26,990
that there's one he teached me and I
went from one side of the case to the

2724
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:27,201
other.

2725
01:08:27,201 --> 01:08:27,571
He hit me,

2726
01:08:27,571 --> 01:08:31,750
you know that tp does like a site tp
just pushing your luck in elliptical that

2727
01:08:31,751 --> 01:08:32,780
one yet I'm going to kick.

2728
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:33,021
Yeah.

2729
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:36,110
And he just did it and I went and hit
the fence on the other side and I was

2730
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:36,261
like,

2731
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:36,560
Yup,

2732
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,460
he's a big boy.

2733
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,330
And that was it.

2734
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:40,040
I was probably maybe 90 cages at the time.

2735
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:41,930
So that was about 200 pounds.

2736
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:42,561
But yeah,

2737
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:43,310
he's a,

2738
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,031
he's a motherfucker.

2739
01:08:44,031 --> 01:08:44,850
You don't want to spar him.

2740
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:47,030
You had to get down to a
five is a bit of a struggle,

2741
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:48,140
which is just so crazy.

2742
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,550
I gave him,

2743
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:49,701
Hey,

2744
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:50,540
you got this list as well?

2745
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:50,961
It wasn't,

2746
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:51,681
it was back from short.

2747
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:51,921
Yeah,

2748
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:52,721
100% but it was,

2749
01:08:52,721 --> 01:08:53,554
it was good work.

2750
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:55,190
I have no idea.

2751
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:59,570
I saw him in between fights at
one 70 and he was 230 pounds.

2752
01:08:59,571 --> 01:09:00,404
I was like,

2753
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,480
what are you way you seen now?

2754
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:03,410
He seen him on Instagram.

2755
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:04,381
Yeah,

2756
01:09:04,381 --> 01:09:05,540
I saw him like couple of weeks ago.

2757
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:06,374
It's just like

2758
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,840
come back as a heavyweight.

2759
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:09,980
Perfect dude.

2760
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:11,780
He's and he already being a heavyweight.

2761
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:12,920
He's me fucking do that heavyweight.

2762
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:18,340
He just couldn't answer the the the puzzle
that was DC DC's the one that really

2763
01:09:18,861 --> 01:09:19,760
hadn't figured out.

2764
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:20,430
Yeah,

2765
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:21,590
DC just figured them out,

2766
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:22,424
man.

2767
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:22,771
He,

2768
01:09:22,771 --> 01:09:23,720
she just knew how to break them.

2769
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,280
I think it's just the gas tank as well.

2770
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:29,210
Sometimes like he puts his foot on the
gas too quick and also learning how to

2771
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,060
not be conservative but
manage your gas tank.

2772
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:33,403
Yeah.

2773
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:34,623
He would just,

2774
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:39,140
he would just swing for the fucking
bleachers as most of the time when he did

2775
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:39,470
that,

2776
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:40,850
he would just put guys in a coma,

2777
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:41,781
you know,

2778
01:09:41,781 --> 01:09:44,120
and I just think at a
certain point in time,

2779
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:44,960
you know,

2780
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:45,800
he was on a tear.

2781
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:46,820
He was at motherfucker,

2782
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:49,580
he was at motherfucker for a long time.

2783
01:09:49,581 --> 01:09:49,881
Is that,

2784
01:09:49,881 --> 01:09:51,170
that one was the one he had with Glover.

2785
01:09:51,171 --> 01:09:52,700
Teixeira that didn't look like much,

2786
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:53,910
not the uppercut.

2787
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:55,890
It didn't look like much and it
was in the middle of a square,

2788
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:56,810
like a scramble.

2789
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,630
Like they were just working
in the dude's amazing.

2790
01:09:59,631 --> 01:10:00,600
It's turning them all with that.

2791
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:00,980
I was like,

2792
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,240
Jesus Christ,

2793
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,480
he had ridiculous punching power,

2794
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:09,530
like some of the most ridiculous
punchy power that Mark Hunt Him.

2795
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:10,800
Uh,

2796
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,660
it was another one.

2797
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,670
Rampage had that as well.

2798
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:17,210
Like I don't understand
[inaudible] and chuck,

2799
01:10:17,211 --> 01:10:18,530
what I liked that he had it was,

2800
01:10:18,531 --> 01:10:19,520
cause he was long as well.

2801
01:10:19,521 --> 01:10:21,080
He wasn't really a thick guy,

2802
01:10:21,081 --> 01:10:22,160
but I think it's as levers,

2803
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:23,180
his arms,

2804
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:24,350
he just knew how to whip that.

2805
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,433
Uh,

2806
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:25,940
if for,

2807
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:26,511
what are they fighting?

2808
01:10:26,511 --> 01:10:27,344
He and though,

2809
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,581
I don't know man,

2810
01:10:28,581 --> 01:10:30,590
but there's a video of chuck working out.

2811
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,450
He's working out with Ray Sefo.

2812
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,473
Shit.

2813
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:38,470
Maybe I'll give them credit benefit
of the doubt because I'm lucky.

2814
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,890
Maybe he hasn't hit pads in the wall.

2815
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:40,491
Let's see.

2816
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:41,970
Maybe three weeks from now.

2817
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,120
Now I have no idea John.

2818
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:44,451
Jay,

2819
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:45,284
me pull that up.

2820
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:46,963
I would think that

2821
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:52,460
I felt good,

2822
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,260
but uh,

2823
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:53,690
uh,

2824
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:53,961
yeah,

2825
01:10:53,961 --> 01:10:54,950
maybe four weeks.

2826
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:55,671
Let's see if he,

2827
01:10:55,671 --> 01:10:56,600
if he keeps the training up,

2828
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:57,290
he might,

2829
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,220
it's like riding a black.

2830
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,620
He didn't look like chuck of old,

2831
01:11:00,621 --> 01:11:00,951
obviously,

2832
01:11:00,951 --> 01:11:02,180
because we have something
to compare it to,

2833
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:03,500
but he,

2834
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:03,891
you know,

2835
01:11:03,891 --> 01:11:04,610
he just,

2836
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:05,990
he's not going to be like that either way,

2837
01:11:05,991 --> 01:11:09,320
but let's see if it can be get better
from what that wasn't on Instagram.

2838
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:13,040
He's a 49 year old guy and
he was probably warming up.

2839
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:13,321
Yeah,

2840
01:11:13,321 --> 01:11:13,861
that's what I mean.

2841
01:11:13,861 --> 01:11:14,694
He's

2842
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:16,970
just him just throwing,

2843
01:11:16,971 --> 01:11:18,200
yelling out loose.

2844
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:20,060
You still sparkling?

2845
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,350
No Real,

2846
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:22,130
no.

2847
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:22,710
You roll.

2848
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:23,161
I roll.

2849
01:11:23,161 --> 01:11:24,090
But I'm 50 years old.

2850
01:11:24,091 --> 01:11:26,200
I can't kill him for real.

2851
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:27,960
I can't get hidden though.

2852
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:28,793
Black don't crack.

2853
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,061
Yeah,

2854
01:11:30,061 --> 01:11:33,210
I'm old enough to not be a willing
to get hit in the head anymore.

2855
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:34,950
When I stopped,

2856
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:37,350
when I was probably 28,

2857
01:11:37,351 --> 01:11:39,270
29 when I first moved to La,

2858
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:40,830
I still did some kickboxing.

2859
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:41,911
I went to Benny,

2860
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:43,950
the jet center and a van eyes.

2861
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:45,860
Remember Benny or Kitezh Benny,

2862
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:50,640
the jet original Oji kickboxers
and him and blinky Rodriguez had a,

2863
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,050
the jet center and Van Eyes.

2864
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:55,650
And for me there was two things that I
wanted to do when I came to California.

2865
01:11:55,651 --> 01:11:57,240
One I wanted to go to hard times,

2866
01:11:57,241 --> 01:11:58,830
billiards cause hard times.

2867
01:11:58,831 --> 01:12:00,300
It Bellflower California pool.

2868
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:00,571
Yeah.

2869
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:03,090
It's one of the legendary
pool halls in the country.

2870
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:03,961
And two,

2871
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:07,680
I wanted to go the jet center and van
eyes and I went there do and it was all

2872
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:12,230
like gang members and blinky Rodriguez
had like a program where he would uh,

2873
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:14,520
let these gang members in and you know,

2874
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:16,110
have them all take classes.

2875
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:20,730
So you'd be sparring with like
hard to hardcore gang bangers.

2876
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:21,481
They had like,

2877
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:25,440
one dude had this like really shitty
tattoo on his back with his gang.

2878
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:26,311
I forget the name.

2879
01:12:26,311 --> 01:12:26,881
And then it said,

2880
01:12:26,881 --> 01:12:30,940
fuck the rest on his back and we're
both putting in our mouth pieces.

2881
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:31,191
I'm like,

2882
01:12:31,191 --> 01:12:31,480
Jesus,

2883
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,110
what am I doing?

2884
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,300
I grew up in the suburbs.

2885
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:35,790
I kind of happened as like gang activity.

2886
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:37,200
Kind of like just seeps
its way into a fight.

2887
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:37,501
They fight.

2888
01:12:37,501 --> 01:12:38,610
They went to fight culture somehow.

2889
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,140
Yeah.

2890
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:40,320
It's also part of leaky,

2891
01:12:40,321 --> 01:12:44,160
I believe blinky Rodriguez
lost his son to gang violence.

2892
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:44,700
All real.

2893
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:44,911
Yeah,

2894
01:12:44,911 --> 01:12:46,710
so I did get an open up program,

2895
01:12:46,711 --> 01:12:49,710
but he was letting kids into the gym and
trying to help the community and help

2896
01:12:49,711 --> 01:12:50,450
these kids.

2897
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:50,850
I'm,

2898
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:52,260
I apologize if I got that wrong,

2899
01:12:52,261 --> 01:12:53,370
but I think I got that right.

2900
01:12:53,371 --> 01:12:54,204
Please look that up.

2901
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:56,910
Blinky Rodriguez son
dies and gang violence.

2902
01:12:56,911 --> 01:12:57,780
I'm pretty sure that's true.

2903
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:00,040
Blinky Rodriguez was a
famous kickboxer too.

2904
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:00,990
He knocked out John,

2905
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:04,410
you've Terrio when Johnny Terrio
was like the PKA champion,

2906
01:13:04,411 --> 01:13:07,390
one of the most feared guys and
world cause that point karate and no,

2907
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:07,471
no,

2908
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:07,591
no.

2909
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:09,330
It was PK karate was kickboxing,

2910
01:13:09,331 --> 01:13:10,290
but it was above the waist,

2911
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:13,200
like Rick Rufus style and Johnny Terrio.

2912
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:13,701
Is this a,

2913
01:13:13,701 --> 01:13:16,080
is that true that he did lose
his son to gang violence?

2914
01:13:16,081 --> 01:13:16,680
Yeah.

2915
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,513
Johnny Terrio.

2916
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:17,961
Fuck you.

2917
01:13:17,961 --> 01:13:20,130
See if you can find blinky Rodriguez.

2918
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:24,060
Kaos Johnny Terrio Antario is t,

2919
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:24,720
h.

2920
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,553
E R.

2921
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:27,690
I forget all the rest of
the way to spell his name.

2922
01:13:27,691 --> 01:13:31,230
But he was the man and
kickboxing in like the eighties,

2923
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,920
cause he was before my time,

2924
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,800
he had pretty decent kicks.

2925
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:37,830
Nothing special but
ridiculous knockout power.

2926
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:39,120
And it's supposed to have like boxing.

2927
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:39,740
Boxing.

2928
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:40,200
Yeah.

2929
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,470
But blinky Rodriguez caught him
with a left hook and starched him.

2930
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:45,450
And that was always like one of blinky.

2931
01:13:45,451 --> 01:13:46,081
Here it is right here.

2932
01:13:46,081 --> 01:13:46,770
They're fighting.

2933
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:49,260
This is like one a
blinkies claims to fame.

2934
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:50,173
Throwback.

2935
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:51,121
Yeah.

2936
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:51,840
I mean this is,

2937
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,650
which was blinky.

2938
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:54,150
Blinky is the guy in the blue shorts.

2939
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:56,460
Johnny Terrio was the tall,

2940
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:56,940
uh,

2941
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:57,810
Montreal guy.

2942
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,070
He was an interesting guy,

2943
01:13:59,071 --> 01:13:59,281
man.

2944
01:13:59,281 --> 01:14:01,680
He was one of the first
advocates of stair running too.

2945
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:02,490
He was,

2946
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:02,791
yeah,

2947
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:03,151
he was,

2948
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:03,600
uh,

2949
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,380
like sprint.

2950
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:04,681
Yeah.

2951
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:08,340
Well running hills and running stairs
because he felt like you felt like for

2952
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:09,121
kicking power.

2953
01:14:09,121 --> 01:14:09,601
Good for you,

2954
01:14:09,601 --> 01:14:10,434
but fuck them.

2955
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:12,460
Fuck rumbling about gravity.

2956
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,030
Oh,

2957
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,600
nice.

2958
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,800
[inaudible] was a karate guy.

2959
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:17,230
He had all kinds of crazy shit
spinning back fist and all that shit.

2960
01:14:17,231 --> 01:14:17,830
But he had this,

2961
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:18,271
oh,

2962
01:14:18,271 --> 01:14:19,061
there it is son.

2963
01:14:19,061 --> 01:14:19,770
Yo.

2964
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:21,260
He had a ridiculous left stuff.

2965
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,260
The arms watching it again.

2966
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,101
Boom.

2967
01:14:24,101 --> 01:14:24,710
That's beautiful.

2968
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:25,543
One more tall.

2969
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,170
Yeah,

2970
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:26,950
from that low kick,

2971
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:27,400
boom,

2972
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,440
boom.

2973
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:30,000
That's textbook.

2974
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,253
Textbook.

2975
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:32,800
Nothing wrong with a textbook.

2976
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:38,010
So it was an honor just to be there in
blinkies Jay or writing class way later.

2977
01:14:38,501 --> 01:14:42,590
I came to La in [inaudible] 93
so it was 93 when I was here.

2978
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:43,080
Dream.

2979
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:43,690
Yeah,

2980
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:47,170
hold the dream where I came
in from Boston to New York,

2981
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:48,160
New York to La.

2982
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:50,350
So I started coming here
around 93 and I think I joined,

2983
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:51,850
I joined the Jetson center,

2984
01:14:51,851 --> 01:14:56,200
but they had got damaged from the
earthquake at 93 and the fucking roof,

2985
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,190
when it would rain,

2986
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:58,720
it would just flood the whole gym.

2987
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,520
So they had a wind up moving shit.

2988
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:02,170
So close.

2989
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:04,180
No word on that fight.

2990
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,070
It's a book for the later this year,

2991
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,020
which fight?

2992
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,020
That Ortiz.

2993
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:09,243
Oh,

2994
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:10,203
later this year.

2995
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:11,020
There's no word.

2996
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:14,290
It's terms when I wonder how
chuck Tito looks as well.

2997
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,060
Maybe you see him hitting pads.

2998
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:16,923
He looks good.

2999
01:15:17,150 --> 01:15:17,350
Look,

3000
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,550
Tito has been winning.

3001
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:19,720
You know he fought recently.

3002
01:15:19,721 --> 01:15:21,580
Pete Chell son and recently and Cheetos,

3003
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,610
deltoid all Yo,

3004
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,200
I saw Tito hip pads.

3005
01:15:26,201 --> 01:15:27,150
He still looks good man.

3006
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:28,003
He's still a beast.

3007
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:29,950
He's got a gang of back surgery.

3008
01:15:29,951 --> 01:15:32,230
So knee surgeries and back surgeries.

3009
01:15:32,231 --> 01:15:33,064
Tito's,

3010
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,840
his whole back is all surgery,

3011
01:15:34,841 --> 01:15:35,590
man.

3012
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:37,240
There's a crazy video of him.

3013
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:38,920
He's lying unconscious.

3014
01:15:38,921 --> 01:15:43,180
They got him sedated and the doctor as
a hammer and a chisel and he's in his

3015
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:44,380
neck and his neck.

3016
01:15:44,381 --> 01:15:44,800
Shit.

3017
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,390
He's going like this clean clink,

3018
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:47,224
clink clink,

3019
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,090
putting some spacer in his neck,

3020
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:50,830
like fusing his neck together.

3021
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,700
Shit.

3022
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,533
Fuck that.

3023
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,700
I'm not about that life too.

3024
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:58,510
That headlock life is a different
life and wrestling cause he's,

3025
01:15:58,511 --> 01:16:00,270
he was a wrestler by um,

3026
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:01,150
by trade.

3027
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:02,020
All those wrestlers,

3028
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:06,160
they all wind up with like some
sort of catastrophic back injury.

3029
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:09,400
It's just a matter of how long can
you hold out your Ameena I'm just,

3030
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:13,000
I'm trying to be preemptive
cause something for the
longest time I kind of like

3031
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,730
just neglected all that stuff with them.

3032
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:16,930
Like Cairo,

3033
01:16:16,931 --> 01:16:17,441
physio.

3034
01:16:17,441 --> 01:16:17,650
Well,

3035
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:17,801
no.

3036
01:16:17,801 --> 01:16:18,640
So now I'm like,

3037
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:22,600
if I want to fight at
this level and be healthy,

3038
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:23,643
avoid injury,

3039
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,840
you got to look after
yourself in that sense.

3040
01:16:25,841 --> 01:16:27,610
What kind of strength and
conditioning work do you do?

3041
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:29,220
Strength and conditioning soon.

3042
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,020
Zillow is a guy that does my strength
and conditioning work and thing is,

3043
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:34,270
I know not much about these things.

3044
01:16:34,271 --> 01:16:36,010
Like even when he tells me to lift,

3045
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,030
like put some template,

3046
01:16:37,031 --> 01:16:38,800
I never asked what the
numbers are because if I,

3047
01:16:38,801 --> 01:16:39,760
if I know what the numbers are,

3048
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:40,594
I feel like I might,

3049
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:42,070
I might get daunted,

3050
01:16:42,071 --> 01:16:43,060
I was shit on my car.

3051
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:43,871
I can't lift this.

3052
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:45,010
And then I'll ask afterwards like,

3053
01:16:45,011 --> 01:16:45,101
oh,

3054
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:45,860
was that dead lifts with,

3055
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:46,001
Oh,

3056
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:46,361
that was,

3057
01:16:46,361 --> 01:16:46,790
uh,

3058
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:47,501
180.

3059
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:47,711
I was like,

3060
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:47,951
okay,

3061
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:48,400
cool.

3062
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,030
That's all right.

3063
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:49,840
But um,

3064
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:50,051
yeah,

3065
01:16:50,051 --> 01:16:51,770
I do shit like dead lift,

3066
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:53,380
a little bit of bench,

3067
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:54,340
a lot of band work.

3068
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,070
Let of plyometrics like exploding.

3069
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:57,671
Yeah.

3070
01:16:57,671 --> 01:16:59,920
Learning how to just fire.

3071
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:00,761
Like when he says go,

3072
01:17:00,761 --> 01:17:01,001
he has,

3073
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:01,360
he,

3074
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,440
he's not just working the muscles.

3075
01:17:02,441 --> 01:17:03,350
He wants to work the mind.

3076
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:06,870
So when it's time to explode
the mind just nose move.

3077
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:07,823
Yeah.

3078
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,010
I quick twitch.

3079
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:10,760
And how many days a week to do it?

3080
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:11,983
Two Times a week.

3081
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:12,800
Two Times a week.

3082
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,880
And when you do it on,

3083
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:15,620
how do you schedule your,

3084
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:19,280
does the someone schedule all of your
workouts or do you do it yourself?

3085
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:20,061
You have input,

3086
01:17:20,061 --> 01:17:20,690
how's that work?

3087
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:21,321
I have input,

3088
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:24,380
but on my main coach teaching Bearman
he's the one that schedules my workout.

3089
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:24,981
So he says,

3090
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:26,180
today we're doing wrestling,

3091
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:27,103
tomorrow we're doing it,

3092
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,890
we have a timetable.

3093
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:30,860
So for each camp we'll just
a timetable accordingly.

3094
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,120
So for example,

3095
01:17:32,121 --> 01:17:32,480
um,

3096
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,060
when I go back now I'm not
going to do any vo two Max.

3097
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:35,571
No.

3098
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:37,340
A lack the capacity or that kind of stuff.

3099
01:17:37,341 --> 01:17:40,910
No camp stuff I want to go
because it's after the fight.

3100
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,833
After the fight.

3101
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:42,900
Yeah.

3102
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:43,521
Skill work yet.

3103
01:17:43,521 --> 01:17:45,410
Just upgrade the software
but also cause um,

3104
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:46,780
yeah I think I've,

3105
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:47,780
I've done well this year.

3106
01:17:47,781 --> 01:17:48,170
Three,

3107
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:49,580
three fights in six months I'm like,

3108
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:50,414
you know what,

3109
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,620
take my foot off the gas a little bit.

3110
01:17:51,621 --> 01:17:52,454
I'm just gonna Chill.

3111
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,141
How long were you chilled?

3112
01:17:53,141 --> 01:17:53,390
40.

3113
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:57,260
Think probably till September may be
born in that time I want to go back to

3114
01:17:57,261 --> 01:17:57,660
yoga,

3115
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:58,890
Bikram cause I have,

3116
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:00,220
my flexibility is Kinda,

3117
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:01,760
I felt it in this camp in the early,

3118
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:04,040
it took me a little bit
longer to get my kicks going.

3119
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,620
Eugene was teasing me saying
I'm getting old and I was like,

3120
01:18:06,621 --> 01:18:07,454
fuck that.

3121
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,121
I still have it.

3122
01:18:08,121 --> 01:18:11,480
But like I just think I need to get my
flexibility back to where it was when you

3123
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:14,270
do pliers and things along those lines
to you stretch heavily afterwards.

3124
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:15,613
Afterwards.

3125
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:17,960
I should and I try to,

3126
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:19,640
but sometimes it just,

3127
01:18:19,641 --> 01:18:20,361
I just neglect the,

3128
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:21,171
I forget,

3129
01:18:21,171 --> 01:18:22,004
I forget.

3130
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:25,250
Kind of so important because that's
the time where you really have some

3131
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,660
opportunity for stretching,

3132
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,720
really advancing your
arrangement metrics really.

3133
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:30,950
Anytime.

3134
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:32,210
Explosive exercise,

3135
01:18:32,211 --> 01:18:33,140
you're really tired.

3136
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:35,950
Your muscles are completely
heated up or you know,

3137
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,260
becomes great for that too because you
get a lot of exhaustion of the muscles.

3138
01:18:39,261 --> 01:18:42,010
Then you have that extreme heat
and everything's super pliable.

3139
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:44,600
When I go to Bikram and I
can still do a full split,

3140
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:47,000
but if I had to do like
a full split right now,

3141
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:49,040
like I know a bit of a struggle.

3142
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,110
I felt the way I went
after big from classes,

3143
01:18:51,111 --> 01:18:52,220
I was always more loose.

3144
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:54,520
I could like heat is something man.

3145
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:54,830
Yeah,

3146
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:55,760
so we're going to hack it though.

3147
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,290
They need to hack it.

3148
01:18:57,980 --> 01:18:58,581
Cut The shit.

3149
01:18:58,581 --> 01:18:59,361
Of course you can hack it.

3150
01:18:59,361 --> 01:19:00,760
If he was between live or die,

3151
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,000
never see your family again.

3152
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:03,680
We'll wait 10 more minutes in the sauna.

3153
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:04,610
I shut the fuck up.

3154
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:06,320
I think even just for the first,

3155
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:07,580
for the first session I ever did,

3156
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:08,414
ever a big room,

3157
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:09,051
I sat there.

3158
01:19:09,051 --> 01:19:10,220
I didn't push myself as hard,

3159
01:19:10,221 --> 01:19:11,240
but I just sat on the Mat.

3160
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:14,540
If maybe that poses a little bit too
much or if I felt some type of way,

3161
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:16,460
but I can handle it.

3162
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:18,290
That ain't bad if you can't look.

3163
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,360
The whole thing about it is adaptation.

3164
01:19:20,361 --> 01:19:22,520
If you overrun your body right away,

3165
01:19:22,521 --> 01:19:23,660
you're not going to recover as well.

3166
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:24,710
You're not gonna enjoy it as much.

3167
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,560
If you can't get through a
90 minute beat from class,

3168
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:31,000
but you can do 60 minutes and you have
to sit down for 10 and then jump back in

3169
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:32,030
and just do that.

3170
01:19:32,031 --> 01:19:32,600
Exactly.

3171
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:32,781
No,

3172
01:19:32,781 --> 01:19:34,040
your body hasn't tell you.

3173
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:34,671
Just sit down.

3174
01:19:34,671 --> 01:19:38,060
Just sit down for the first part and
just feel that he just slide what you can

3175
01:19:38,061 --> 01:19:38,841
and if you can't do it,

3176
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:39,674
just sit down.

3177
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:40,221
Dude,

3178
01:19:40,221 --> 01:19:41,600
that shit is so good for you.

3179
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:41,901
I know.

3180
01:19:41,901 --> 01:19:42,351
Be Crumbs.

3181
01:19:42,351 --> 01:19:43,300
A crazy ass hall.

3182
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,970
I know there's some stories that's crazy.

3183
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:46,940
Did the HBO,

3184
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,260
but here's the thing,

3185
01:19:48,261 --> 01:19:48,920
man.

3186
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,410
Just because he's crazy
doesn't mean it's effective.

3187
01:19:51,411 --> 01:19:53,240
You can't throw out the
baby with the bath water.

3188
01:19:53,241 --> 01:19:54,320
I know that dude's nuts,

3189
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:55,370
but also,

3190
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:56,510
here's the other thing about beaker,

3191
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:59,390
although he's a great Yogi
and his system is amazing.

3192
01:19:59,391 --> 01:20:01,250
I don't even think he
came up with that system.

3193
01:20:01,251 --> 01:20:05,240
I think that system has existed for a
long time and it's one of the India or

3194
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,083
something,

3195
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,530
Google this please.

3196
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:08,580
Uh,

3197
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:13,580
I think he lost a lawsuit based on him
trying to copyright those sequences of

3198
01:20:15,661 --> 01:20:16,494
Yoga.

3199
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:19,800
And I think the problem is that the yoga,

3200
01:20:19,801 --> 01:20:20,521
those moves,

3201
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:24,720
all those moves have existed for literally
thousands of years to claim them,

3202
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,510
well he was trying to crank
claimed them in succession.

3203
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:32,500
So like say if you opened up the style
bender yoga class and you used all be

3204
01:20:32,501 --> 01:20:33,750
crumbs moonless that idea,

3205
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:38,610
not bad like it vendors that you want
to meet yoga girls in the back of the

3206
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:39,444
class.

3207
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:47,370
What he's essentially saying is that he
came up with this idea to put them all

3208
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,570
in that particular order,

3209
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,610
which is a super effective order.

3210
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:52,180
Like kids order of,

3211
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:54,990
of yoga poses is an amazing worldwide.

3212
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:55,930
Yup.

3213
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:56,551
Everywhere you go.

3214
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:57,660
I've taken classes everywhere.

3215
01:20:57,661 --> 01:20:58,494
It's all the same.

3216
01:20:58,810 --> 01:20:59,581
I only went to one,

3217
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:00,990
so I thought it's the same thing for that.

3218
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:01,830
If you do the,

3219
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:02,300
well there's,

3220
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:02,651
you know,

3221
01:21:02,651 --> 01:21:04,140
there's like Vinyasa,

3222
01:21:04,141 --> 01:21:06,660
there's flow classes which
are also very interesting.

3223
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:07,441
But I,

3224
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:08,640
and I've taken those two,

3225
01:21:08,641 --> 01:21:08,970
but,

3226
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:09,390
um,

3227
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:12,990
there's something really good about
the 90 minute beaker and program.

3228
01:21:12,991 --> 01:21:14,040
He just has it nailed.

3229
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:15,181
He figured it out,

3230
01:21:15,181 --> 01:21:17,100
but I don't even know
if that was his idea.

3231
01:21:17,101 --> 01:21:18,810
I think it was other people that did that.

3232
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,610
He sued people or he did?

3233
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,360
Yeah,

3234
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,193
he's gangster.

3235
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,033
He so crazy.

3236
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:23,581
They had this,

3237
01:21:23,581 --> 01:21:24,040
uh,

3238
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:24,420
the,

3239
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:24,691
I mean,

3240
01:21:24,691 --> 01:21:25,950
I don't even mean in a good way.

3241
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,950
They had this HBO documentary
where they're interviewing
him and he was talking

3242
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:30,450
about girls saying that,

3243
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:30,601
uh,

3244
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:30,961
you know,

3245
01:21:30,961 --> 01:21:31,311
he,

3246
01:21:31,311 --> 01:21:32,550
he banged them and all
this different thing.

3247
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:33,061
He goes,

3248
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:33,894
listen to me.

3249
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:34,370
He goes,

3250
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:38,850
there are people that would pay $1
million for one drop of my sperm,

3251
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:42,060
$1 million by HBO.

3252
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,133
And he's like this one.

3253
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:45,330
Like as if there's a bunch
of people like waiting,

3254
01:21:45,331 --> 01:21:49,110
like an auction house filled with
people who wants three houses

3255
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,320
right here,

3256
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,430
$1 million.

3257
01:21:53,431 --> 01:21:56,040
We have $1 million for one drop of sperm.

3258
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:56,730
Who's alway?

3259
01:21:56,730 --> 01:21:57,241
How old is he?

3260
01:21:57,241 --> 01:21:58,080
What does he look like?

3261
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:59,093
Three drops.

3262
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:03,060
That's what kind of specimen
is he like a old type dude?

3263
01:22:03,061 --> 01:22:03,900
Is he in shape?

3264
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:04,681
He,

3265
01:22:04,681 --> 01:22:07,780
he's not holding it together the best.

3266
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:09,343
You know,

3267
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:10,710
if you and him,

3268
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:11,940
if he didn't see you,

3269
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:15,840
if you're both the same skin color and
he didn't see your heads and he looked at

3270
01:22:15,841 --> 01:22:16,350
your torsos,

3271
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:17,100
you'd know who's who.

3272
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:17,550
Okay.

3273
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:18,001
You know what I'm saying?

3274
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:18,810
Let's put it that way.

3275
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:19,643
Let's put it that way.

3276
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:19,951
I mean,

3277
01:22:19,951 --> 01:22:21,210
he's like a seven year old guy.

3278
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:21,571
I mean,

3279
01:22:21,571 --> 01:22:25,260
how long can you still make
sperm one drop of my Instagram?

3280
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:25,961
One minute.

3281
01:22:25,961 --> 01:22:26,794
You're like,

3282
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:29,581
yeah,

3283
01:22:29,581 --> 01:22:30,510
he's there.

3284
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:31,050
He is.

3285
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:31,381
Oh,

3286
01:22:31,381 --> 01:22:32,080
it's a boy.

3287
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,180
It's still looking jacked.

3288
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:34,740
Let me see.

3289
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:35,940
Go large on that picture.

3290
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:37,770
Not Bad.

3291
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:38,760
Probably a few.

3292
01:22:38,761 --> 01:22:39,594
Too many carbs.

3293
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,940
It needs to get some squats
or some hill runs in,

3294
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:44,190
but when it comes to yoga,

3295
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:47,370
he's flexible as fuck and
knows how to do all that.

3296
01:22:47,371 --> 01:22:50,040
She doesn't look 70
well you know what man,

3297
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,410
look when you t let's go back to
that picture again real quick.

3298
01:22:52,411 --> 01:22:53,244
There he does.

3299
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:55,140
Come back to that picture again
real quick in his underwear.

3300
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:56,630
The one in the RF?

3301
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:57,090
Yeah.

3302
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:58,650
Well the one right above that.

3303
01:22:58,651 --> 01:22:59,101
Right above that.

3304
01:22:59,101 --> 01:22:59,730
Yeah.

3305
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:00,540
Listen man,

3306
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:00,780
look,

3307
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:04,620
just be real gravities
and let's be real as fuck.

3308
01:23:04,621 --> 01:23:05,920
If you walk around

3309
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,570
wearing underwear like that,

3310
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:08,710
any other class,

3311
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:11,400
you're there to fuck
that guy's dead facts.

3312
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,170
Fuck he's there to fuck.

3313
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:15,880
And if you leave a girl alone with him,

3314
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:16,990
he's going to touch her.

3315
01:23:16,991 --> 01:23:18,580
He's going to pull that Indian dick out.

3316
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,230
He's going to send it home.

3317
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:22,540
He's gonna say like,

3318
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:23,440
what is,

3319
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:24,460
what's an Indian Dick?

3320
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,480
As if it was still like a,

3321
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:26,640
just bring it out with the flu day,

3322
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:29,420
like a Cobra.

3323
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:34,510
These weird little taste skivvies

3324
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:35,580
out here.

3325
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:37,660
And if you're a dude and you come in,

3326
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,230
you can't be like an amateur yoga.

3327
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,073
Oh Gosh,

3328
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,193
look at that girl.

3329
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,130
Yeah.

3330
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:44,963
Might be.

3331
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,193
Yeah.

3332
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,633
Okay.

3333
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:52,230
Like you can't have underwear like
dead on and not be good at yoga.

3334
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:55,740
Like if you're like a beginner and you
fall down every time we tried to eagle

3335
01:23:55,741 --> 01:23:56,574
pose,

3336
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:56,970
they'll,

3337
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:57,601
they'll talk to you.

3338
01:23:57,601 --> 01:23:57,951
Hey man,

3339
01:23:57,951 --> 01:23:58,870
why don't you put them more clothes?

3340
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,190
But if he walks in there
with his man bucks,

3341
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:02,701
yeah,

3342
01:24:02,701 --> 01:24:04,080
he's kind of hard to flex man.

3343
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,153
You know what I mean?

3344
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:06,143
Fucking,

3345
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:07,103
it's like,

3346
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:12,450
I dunno if you were a boulder bowling
glove covered with rhinestones.

3347
01:24:12,451 --> 01:24:13,830
Like you bet Michael
Jackson gloves though.

3348
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:14,860
Eh?

3349
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:15,693
Well that's the thing.

3350
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:17,003
Someone should do it.

3351
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,550
Bullying level where I still was on it.

3352
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,781
What else do you do?

3353
01:24:21,781 --> 01:24:22,890
Do you ever do gymnastics?

3354
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,090
Gymnastics?

3355
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:24,840
No,

3356
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,673
I dance.

3357
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:26,660
What kind of debt you said?

3358
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:27,331
You said that earlier.

3359
01:24:27,331 --> 01:24:30,600
I forgot to go back to start
off with popping as a kid.

3360
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:31,643
Now I'm crump.

3361
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,371
Crump dance.

3362
01:24:32,371 --> 01:24:32,990
That's like,

3363
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:33,450
yeah.

3364
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:34,350
What's a crump dance?

3365
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:36,060
Crumped dance is um,

3366
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:37,980
actually were originally in La.

3367
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:39,540
It's a really an expression.

3368
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:39,870
Yeah,

3369
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:40,890
south central La,

3370
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:42,240
like tie dyes and big meal.

3371
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:43,083
Started it off.

3372
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:46,140
But am I remember watching his movie as
a kid and called rise and that's kind of

3373
01:24:46,141 --> 01:24:47,250
what introduced to the world.

3374
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:51,080
Kind of like the way Obama did with
[inaudible] made it more mainstream rise

3375
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,080
spelled out.

3376
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:53,401
Let's just popping.

3377
01:24:53,401 --> 01:24:54,330
This is what pop and Pete,

3378
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,000
I'll look up a guy called tide ice.

3379
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,380
T I a good look at him.

3380
01:24:58,381 --> 01:24:58,950
Go.

3381
01:24:58,950 --> 01:24:59,581
Hold on a second.

3382
01:24:59,581 --> 01:25:00,414
This shit.

3383
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:02,010
So this guy is from,

3384
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,150
from the electric boogaloo.

3385
01:25:03,151 --> 01:25:04,380
So this is how I started off.

3386
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,041
Look at him.

3387
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:06,270
Go back in the day.

3388
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:07,620
What took the tower though?

3389
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:08,190
Seriously?

3390
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:09,023
Or your hands.

3391
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:09,870
You'll probably use it with a,

3392
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:10,770
with a move or something.

3393
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:12,721
Oh yeah,

3394
01:25:12,721 --> 01:25:13,554
he's a man.

3395
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,590
It's so strange like that.

3396
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:19,290
People went thousands of
years without these styles.

3397
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:21,240
And then when electronic
music came along people went,

3398
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:22,500
oh that sounds different.

3399
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,580
Let's move different.

3400
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:24,000
Yeah.

3401
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,833
But for me,

3402
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:29,010
I had this metamorphosis last year or
like around my birthday and then for

3403
01:25:29,011 --> 01:25:32,770
whatever reason I just went back to dance
because I felt like I had this damn,

3404
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:34,050
you don't have people get writer's block.

3405
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:37,830
I had dancers block for like
maybe six years or five years.

3406
01:25:37,831 --> 01:25:38,670
I just couldn't create,

3407
01:25:38,671 --> 01:25:40,890
I could dance like a flow
by couldn't create anything.

3408
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:45,980
Do you know Loma Chenko studied four
years of you kind of Lin classical

3409
01:25:46,321 --> 01:25:46,890
Ukrainian,

3410
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:47,730
Ukrainian dance.

3411
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:49,680
One thing I learned is muscle memory.

3412
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:53,670
I know dancers who have to do shows and
they have to learn like 20 different

3413
01:25:53,671 --> 01:25:56,250
sequences and that's for the whole show.

3414
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:56,971
Like 20 different.

3415
01:25:56,971 --> 01:25:59,880
Each sequence might be like anywhere
from a minute to three minutes and they

3416
01:25:59,881 --> 01:26:01,350
have to do it like that.

3417
01:26:01,351 --> 01:26:02,640
So when I started dancing again,

3418
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,190
when I went back to training,

3419
01:26:04,191 --> 01:26:05,220
drilling my,

3420
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,070
I can retain that
information so much better.

3421
01:26:07,071 --> 01:26:08,120
Like it's muscle memory,

3422
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:08,630
right?

3423
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:10,690
So I don't even have to think
about certain moves when I do it.

3424
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,533
It just boom,

3425
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:12,770
because I remember this,

3426
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:14,450
it's easy and the muscle
just doesn't like,

3427
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:14,961
how do you do that?

3428
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:15,794
I wasn't thinking.

3429
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,880
So dancing really translates into
muscle memory like that in the,

3430
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:22,250
in the FLS where like dancers
I think have the best,

3431
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:25,220
best muscle memory or maybe
one of the best in the world.

3432
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:27,330
What makes sense that you are,

3433
01:26:27,331 --> 01:26:29,990
you're learning to use your
body in a choreographed way?

3434
01:26:29,991 --> 01:26:30,980
Almost like a car,

3435
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:32,030
you know,

3436
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:34,130
like stupid.

3437
01:26:34,131 --> 01:26:34,964
When I was a kid,

3438
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:36,140
I used to think I really did.

3439
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:37,010
I used to think it was dollar.

3440
01:26:37,011 --> 01:26:37,844
They were cool.

3441
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:39,800
They look cool when someone's doing it.

3442
01:26:39,801 --> 01:26:40,634
But I hate learning.

3443
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:44,120
I felt like I only learned
them to get the next belt.

3444
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,410
But then once I learned them,

3445
01:26:45,411 --> 01:26:45,861
I forgot.

3446
01:26:45,861 --> 01:26:46,311
I'm totally,

3447
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:47,900
but now that I think back,

3448
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:52,700
I realized like that was a mistake on
my part because when that was was I

3449
01:26:52,701 --> 01:26:53,690
thought I knew better,

3450
01:26:53,691 --> 01:26:54,710
which is hilarious.

3451
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,280
I thought I knew better than people
who learn martial arts for thousands of

3452
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,700
years and it's not the Catia makes you
a better fighter but it makes you have

3453
01:27:01,701 --> 01:27:03,350
better control of your body.

3454
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:06,630
And the thing about like
holding a kick up in the air,

3455
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:08,840
there's a lot of people
that just can't do that.

3456
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,530
I can't actually like that.

3457
01:27:10,531 --> 01:27:11,030
But he's,

3458
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:15,050
the guy told me to taekwondo
like literally his dexterity
in his legs heal on

3459
01:27:15,051 --> 01:27:15,530
one leg,

3460
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:15,741
pop,

3461
01:27:15,741 --> 01:27:15,951
pop,

3462
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:16,131
pop,

3463
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:16,341
pop,

3464
01:27:16,341 --> 01:27:16,660
pop,

3465
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:16,900
walk,

3466
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,200
have you forward and he'll do it.

3467
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,060
The other lists like all the way down,

3468
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,650
all the way back up
south port or for dogs.

3469
01:27:22,651 --> 01:27:23,540
It's a balance.

3470
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:27,170
And I think the balance is
between that and maybe lifestyle,

3471
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,033
Thai style.

3472
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:29,120
That's what I'm trying to find.

3473
01:27:29,121 --> 01:27:32,810
And sometimes you can go one side too
much but says you have to be objective

3474
01:27:32,811 --> 01:27:33,500
enough to say,

3475
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,333
this is what I need,

3476
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:35,990
this is how you know
and you feel your body.

3477
01:27:35,991 --> 01:27:37,010
You kind of aim for each,

3478
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:37,791
each fight as well.

3479
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:38,990
You know what you want to use.

3480
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:40,040
Like with him.

3481
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:43,220
I wasn't gonna I wasn't gonna throw
some spinning shit at some point.

3482
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:46,900
I did spitting shit.

3483
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:48,230
I say,

3484
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:49,063
Oh,

3485
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:50,090
I met him,

3486
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:50,923
I met him.

3487
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:51,470
Uh,

3488
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:51,891
what's his name?

3489
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:52,101
I was,

3490
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:52,420
uh,

3491
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:53,590
it was after I saw Dana and them.

3492
01:27:53,591 --> 01:27:54,210
So I was walking,

3493
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:56,000
walking around with Tony
a shout out to Tony,

3494
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:56,750
Angela.

3495
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:57,111
And then,

3496
01:27:57,111 --> 01:27:57,470
um,

3497
01:27:57,470 --> 01:27:58,400
I see Jay silver,

3498
01:27:58,401 --> 01:27:59,510
who was the guy who used to fight.

3499
01:28:00,050 --> 01:28:00,883
He's a thick boy,

3500
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,790
like fights,

3501
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:05,530
nothing out of Ruca and he just like
kind of recognize that what's up and they

3502
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:06,380
ain't got me into the club.

3503
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,240
And then yeah,

3504
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:09,011
Nick Diaz show us,

3505
01:28:09,011 --> 01:28:09,151
Hey,

3506
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:09,590
what's up?

3507
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:09,931
How are you doing?

3508
01:28:09,931 --> 01:28:12,190
And I just shook his hand
and I was it and yeah,

3509
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,870
he's quick game.

3510
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:14,181
Cool.

3511
01:28:14,181 --> 01:28:14,960
Guy's a legend.

3512
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:15,793
He's still fighting.

3513
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:16,671
Well,

3514
01:28:16,671 --> 01:28:19,070
he's doing whatever the fuck
Nick Diaz wants to do right now.

3515
01:28:19,071 --> 01:28:20,600
It seems like Vegas all the time.

3516
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:22,220
She's only going to fight for,

3517
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,810
I think this is just,

3518
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:24,860
I'm going to go out on a limb here.

3519
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:29,390
I think the lack of the UFC
talking Nick Diaz into a fight.

3520
01:28:29,391 --> 01:28:31,310
I know he's crazy and
he knows he's crazy too.

3521
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:36,290
That is a criminal criminal
underused of a valued asset.

3522
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:39,440
I think if you wanted to have a
giant paper view right in a big star,

3523
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:39,891
fuck,

3524
01:28:39,891 --> 01:28:40,730
he's a huge star,

3525
01:28:40,731 --> 01:28:41,630
so it's his brother,

3526
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:43,670
but they haven't fought in forever.

3527
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:46,170
Like Nate hasn't fought since
he lost to Connor and the,

3528
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:47,580
they were going to close for the big,

3529
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:48,713
big money fight,

3530
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:50,990
but probably he made a
ton of money and you know,

3531
01:28:50,991 --> 01:28:54,420
he doesn't live a crazy lifestyle and
I believe Nate just got a kid real.

3532
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:54,770
Yeah,

3533
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:55,570
I think,

3534
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:57,500
I think I read that on Google.

3535
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:58,371
See if that's true.

3536
01:28:58,371 --> 01:28:59,690
Nate Diaz just had a child.

3537
01:28:59,840 --> 01:28:59,991
He,

3538
01:28:59,991 --> 01:29:00,381
the way,

3539
01:29:00,381 --> 01:29:01,250
congratulations.

3540
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:02,521
He's either,

3541
01:29:02,521 --> 01:29:03,181
congratulations,

3542
01:29:03,181 --> 01:29:04,650
you had a kid or
congratulations that you did.

3543
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:09,690
I love that dude though.

3544
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,380
I love Neda along the way.

3545
01:29:11,381 --> 01:29:12,690
They fought their fine.

3546
01:29:12,691 --> 01:29:13,431
That Paul daily fine.

3547
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:15,030
I watched the live bro.

3548
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:16,650
I think I sat down for that fight.

3549
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:17,460
You were there live?

3550
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:17,531
No,

3551
01:29:17,531 --> 01:29:17,620
no,

3552
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:17,691
no,

3553
01:29:17,691 --> 01:29:17,761
no,

3554
01:29:17,761 --> 01:29:17,940
no.

3555
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:20,490
I was on the couch while I
was standing up on the couch.

3556
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,500
He's crazy shit.

3557
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,433
He got clipped too.

3558
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:23,760
He's one of the rare people.

3559
01:29:23,761 --> 01:29:25,690
It's got clipped by
Paul Daley and survived.

3560
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:28,620
They come back and then knocked him out
and see the way Paul fell back as well.

3561
01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:29,670
Dan stanky leg.

3562
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,880
It's almost like his legs
just gave out Austin.

3563
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:32,250
Yeah,

3564
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,083
that's what it is.

3565
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:36,930
I keep saying it's easier to knock
someone out when they're tired like that

3566
01:29:36,931 --> 01:29:37,530
fight.

3567
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:37,800
Um,

3568
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,633
what's a brat?

3569
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:39,570
Had good cardio.

3570
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:41,370
He was able to take it
and I was finding it.

3571
01:29:41,371 --> 01:29:41,701
There was one,

3572
01:29:41,701 --> 01:29:42,630
I hit him with a body shot,

3573
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:44,710
I think buddy kick and yeah,

3574
01:29:44,711 --> 01:29:45,870
he went for a take down straight away.

3575
01:29:45,870 --> 01:29:46,260
I pushed,

3576
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:46,951
I pushed him off,

3577
01:29:46,951 --> 01:29:47,401
frame them,

3578
01:29:47,401 --> 01:29:48,540
got him against the fence or something.

3579
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:50,160
But yeah.

3580
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:50,790
Um,

3581
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:52,560
it's easy to get like some
of these guys you can see,

3582
01:29:52,561 --> 01:29:53,520
he never gave me that sign.

3583
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:54,354
Like I'm ready to go.

3584
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:55,680
Like when they are ready to go,

3585
01:29:55,681 --> 01:29:56,700
like I want out.

3586
01:29:57,690 --> 01:30:00,930
Overwhelming performances of Nick's
career was against frank shamrock.

3587
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:01,910
Frank's all dude.

3588
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:02,641
That was when I was like,

3589
01:30:02,641 --> 01:30:03,360
Whoa,

3590
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,140
just body shot.

3591
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:04,471
He won't,

3592
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:06,280
but he put his head on
his chest and just bop,

3593
01:30:06,290 --> 01:30:06,620
bop,

3594
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:06,941
bop,

3595
01:30:06,941 --> 01:30:07,271
bop,

3596
01:30:07,271 --> 01:30:09,870
bop shit to him and frank was like,

3597
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:10,411
really?

3598
01:30:10,411 --> 01:30:11,940
You're talking Shit [inaudible] interview?

3599
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:12,421
He was like,

3600
01:30:12,421 --> 01:30:12,781
yeah,

3601
01:30:12,781 --> 01:30:13,620
I couldn't believe it.

3602
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:17,340
So Ah,

3603
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:19,290
not but honestly like that pace,

3604
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:21,060
even like my first fight,

3605
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:24,580
it's sort of Diaz asking a way
where it's like I didn't do when I,

3606
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,680
when I knew he was ready to go,

3607
01:30:25,681 --> 01:30:27,030
I just put a steady pace.

3608
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:29,430
Just put your foot on the gas a
little bit but not gas it out.

3609
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:30,480
Just pop,

3610
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:30,780
pop,

3611
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:31,081
pop,

3612
01:30:31,081 --> 01:30:31,321
pop,

3613
01:30:31,321 --> 01:30:32,040
find the shot,

3614
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:32,670
find the shop,

3615
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:33,480
find the ship.

3616
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:38,480
There's no need to like it's wasted
energy wise approach to your will to just

3617
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:40,700
your overall and then they gain.

3618
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:42,860
But in particular to your
striking game is that you're,

3619
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:46,860
you're one of those guys that showing
people that you can be very exciting but

3620
01:30:46,861 --> 01:30:47,694
take minimal.

3621
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,770
There was a couple moments in that fight
where Brad was charging at you where

3622
01:30:50,771 --> 01:30:51,550
you're like hub,

3623
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:52,060
hub,

3624
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:52,530
hub.

3625
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:53,363
Here we go.

3626
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:54,290
Side.

3627
01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:54,510
Yeah,

3628
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:55,980
100% take the center.

3629
01:30:55,981 --> 01:30:57,180
People don't take the center man.

3630
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,550
Almost as exciting as watching
someone get knocked down.

3631
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:02,910
I like watching someone figure
out that like hit the right hands,

3632
01:31:02,911 --> 01:31:04,080
come in and left hands come behind it.

3633
01:31:04,081 --> 01:31:04,810
I'm not there.

3634
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:05,590
Here a queen.

3635
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:05,871
Sweet.

3636
01:31:05,871 --> 01:31:06,130
I'll it.

3637
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:07,980
It'll bit in clean sweep if one,

3638
01:31:07,981 --> 01:31:09,390
George didn't give one round to him,

3639
01:31:09,391 --> 01:31:12,300
but I don't know what's round he gave
cause I thought I had all five rounds

3640
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:13,020
after watching it.

3641
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:18,020
So it was like you can't even 50 45
50 45 and then 49 46 and I was like,

3642
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:18,841
damn,

3643
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:21,360
that would have been cool if it
was just like a 50 45 clean sweep.

3644
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:25,950
Well the most important thing was
not a judge's interpretation of it.

3645
01:31:25,951 --> 01:31:28,260
It was the actual performance
and people will enjoy it.

3646
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:29,640
Some people were like young people,

3647
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,930
they get caught up in knockouts a lot.

3648
01:31:30,931 --> 01:31:31,111
Like,

3649
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:32,280
oh he didn't finish Brad though.

3650
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:33,990
But a lot of people,

3651
01:31:33,991 --> 01:31:34,860
the response was,

3652
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:37,170
I'd rather see that than
just a quick finish.

3653
01:31:37,171 --> 01:31:38,400
Cause he worked the guy,

3654
01:31:38,401 --> 01:31:39,300
he didn't get gassed.

3655
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,170
He didn't,

3656
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:40,860
you know,

3657
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:41,161
I didn't,

3658
01:31:41,161 --> 01:31:41,811
I didn't dip aisle.

3659
01:31:41,811 --> 01:31:43,350
Maybe the third friend of
mine had dipped a little bit,

3660
01:31:43,351 --> 01:31:44,184
but I didn't look it.

3661
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:45,720
I have my poker face on and I was fine.

3662
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,810
I felt fresh and I even said
after my last fight before that,

3663
01:31:48,811 --> 01:31:50,490
like that was based on
the three round camp,

3664
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:52,530
the one I fought in Arizona,

3665
01:31:52,531 --> 01:31:55,050
it was based on a three round camp and
I looked in the camera as I can go five

3666
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:55,231
rounds.

3667
01:31:55,231 --> 01:31:56,030
I told Eugene McCarthy,

3668
01:31:56,030 --> 01:31:56,251
I was like,

3669
01:31:56,251 --> 01:31:56,401
man,

3670
01:31:56,401 --> 01:31:58,170
I feel I can go another two rounds easily.

3671
01:31:58,590 --> 01:32:00,670
And this was based around five rounds.

3672
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:01,810
So after this fight,

3673
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,130
honestly I had the reserve rating.

3674
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:04,780
I was like maybe three rounds.

3675
01:32:04,781 --> 01:32:05,860
I could've gone if,

3676
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:07,550
if I need it to you.

3677
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:10,690
Do you ever anticipate a time where
people would have more than five rounds at

3678
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:11,524
an MMA fight?

3679
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:13,540
Most of the time anymore.

3680
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,070
Most of the time it's totally unnecessary,

3681
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:16,450
but sometimes I,

3682
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:17,020
it was too long.

3683
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:17,291
I was like,

3684
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:18,700
I'm going to get this guy
and like three rounds.

3685
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:20,660
I thought so I felt so I was lazy.

3686
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,690
I don't know,

3687
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:24,580
maybe that's just me bigging up myself,

3688
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:25,060
you know,

3689
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:25,781
my own ego.

3690
01:32:25,781 --> 01:32:26,740
But yeah,

3691
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:28,690
I just felt like I would take him three,

3692
01:32:28,691 --> 01:32:29,540
two or three rounds,

3693
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:31,810
put five rounds and I
still look good doing it.

3694
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:32,770
So I was happy.

3695
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:37,450
Now when you see a guy like Paulo
Costa who has like this just,

3696
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:41,580
I mean he's not totally hittable where
like everything you throw you're going to

3697
01:32:41,581 --> 01:32:41,831
hit him.

3698
01:32:41,831 --> 01:32:43,300
But he's much more aggressive,

3699
01:32:43,301 --> 01:32:44,370
much more than know things.

3700
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:46,510
You see these short arms.

3701
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:47,860
I stood next to him,

3702
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:48,760
I was lucky he ice me.

3703
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:50,200
He's trying to act like
he doesn't know who I am.

3704
01:32:50,201 --> 01:32:51,100
And I saw an interview just like,

3705
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:51,911
oh I do not know.

3706
01:32:51,911 --> 01:32:52,960
That guy was like,

3707
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:54,753
dude,

3708
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:56,170
what the fuck I am now

3709
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,560
that I said after my first fight,

3710
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:00,610
cause these guys want to pretend.

3711
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:02,120
And uh,

3712
01:33:02,130 --> 01:33:03,100
I dunno where it comes from.

3713
01:33:03,101 --> 01:33:04,890
Maybe because of years
of not getting noticed.

3714
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:05,501
So I'm like,

3715
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:06,330
don't try to act like,

3716
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:06,971
cause a lot of guys,

3717
01:33:06,971 --> 01:33:07,180
they'll,

3718
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:10,420
they'll creep from my Instagram and then
like see me in real life and act all

3719
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:11,561
high and mighty.

3720
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:11,931
And I'm,

3721
01:33:11,931 --> 01:33:12,640
I'm a nice guy.

3722
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:13,690
I like to be friends,

3723
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:14,130
horse.

3724
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:14,921
I like to hug people.

3725
01:33:14,921 --> 01:33:16,240
Say what's up or at least just nod like,

3726
01:33:16,241 --> 01:33:16,790
hey,

3727
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:17,531
you know what's up?

3728
01:33:17,531 --> 01:33:18,161
I know who you are.

3729
01:33:18,161 --> 01:33:18,731
You know I am.

3730
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:20,080
But some people flexed too much.

3731
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,333
So for him.

3732
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:22,031
Yeah.

3733
01:33:22,031 --> 01:33:23,410
He knows why I'm in this manager.

3734
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:23,980
What's his name?

3735
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:24,910
The fucking Gremlin?

3736
01:33:26,150 --> 01:33:26,860
No,

3737
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:28,890
he looks like fucking area or the area.

3738
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,000
You don't know what lead Ishmael.

3739
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:32,120
Undertakers guy.

3740
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:32,330
No,

3741
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:32,910
he is.

3742
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:35,980
Well lead is though mixed
martial arts led you fights dude.

3743
01:33:35,981 --> 01:33:38,560
He fought in UFC 12 really?

3744
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:39,220
Yeah.

3745
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:42,220
He fired a Takahashi is and who we fight.

3746
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:45,310
Maybe it was 13 c 12 or
13 did he choked out?

3747
01:33:45,311 --> 01:33:48,610
Hoists Gracie in a Jujitsu
match in Rio when hoists.

3748
01:33:48,611 --> 01:33:51,730
Gracie had just won all the
UFC and he was a fucking man.

3749
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:55,570
Ishmael who was a crossing
Gracie black belt.

3750
01:33:55,571 --> 01:33:56,404
Watch this.

3751
01:33:56,410 --> 01:34:01,410
He got ahold of hoists and this was in
Brazil and a giant fucking audience.

3752
01:34:02,051 --> 01:34:03,610
It was in a soccer stadium.

3753
01:34:03,611 --> 01:34:08,170
I think it was a big ass audience
and they wind up going to the ground.

3754
01:34:08,171 --> 01:34:09,004
Scoot ahead.

3755
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,930
Well you've got him in a clock choke.

3756
01:34:10,931 --> 01:34:13,180
And I remember this because at the time,

3757
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:13,691
yeah,

3758
01:34:13,691 --> 01:34:14,350
at the time

3759
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:19,350
I was like maybe a maybe a blue belt
and I had tapped the guy with a clock

3760
01:34:19,841 --> 01:34:20,170
choke.

3761
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:20,420
I was like

3762
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:23,270
clock jokes and that Shit and he uh,

3763
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:27,140
I remember those at the
g clock chokes with a G.

3764
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:28,140
I try,

3765
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:29,060
I tried it with a little bit.

3766
01:34:29,061 --> 01:34:31,480
I can do it when it's all sweaty
but I'm with my arms cause I'm,

3767
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:34,010
I got long arms so I can kind
of get it a little bit if I,

3768
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:38,120
if I tweak it right and
we'll lead had that constant,

3769
01:34:38,150 --> 01:34:39,380
we'll eg they used to call him,

3770
01:34:39,381 --> 01:34:40,910
he had that constant pressure.

3771
01:34:40,911 --> 01:34:43,160
Carlson Gracie top game crushing,

3772
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:43,820
you know,

3773
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:44,870
where are you going to shit out.

3774
01:34:44,871 --> 01:34:46,670
Bone fragments have to roll with them.

3775
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:48,560
That was their style man.

3776
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:52,190
Scoot ahead a little bit and you see
will lead gets that clock choke so he can

3777
01:34:52,191 --> 01:34:54,380
tell he's the guy that's
like talking for right here,

3778
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:54,801
right here.

3779
01:34:54,801 --> 01:34:57,500
He got here and you want
to put noise asleep.

3780
01:34:57,501 --> 01:35:00,500
Hoist didn't even cap
went out like a warrior.

3781
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,270
Look at that is out.

3782
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:02,751
Fuck out.

3783
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:03,271
Pressure League.

3784
01:35:03,271 --> 01:35:04,610
Everybody running out to the mat.

3785
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:05,603
You've got to let it go.

3786
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:06,021
Fuck.

3787
01:35:06,021 --> 01:35:06,910
That was what he did to know him.

3788
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:08,930
He was on the cost side number three.

3789
01:35:08,931 --> 01:35:11,270
The referee should have
known he I saw him limp.

3790
01:35:11,271 --> 01:35:12,740
No you're right.

3791
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:13,460
Shit.

3792
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:14,700
But this was back.

3793
01:35:14,701 --> 01:35:17,840
See there's crossing back then this was
when there was like a bit of a rivalry

3794
01:35:17,841 --> 01:35:20,970
between Carlson Gracie
and worried about that.

3795
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:21,501
Yeah,

3796
01:35:21,501 --> 01:35:24,510
I mean Hickson and hoists
and Heuler and it was,

3797
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:24,840
there was,

3798
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,060
she was a bit of a rivalry.

3799
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:27,143
It was out.

3800
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,490
He was a beast man.

3801
01:35:28,530 --> 01:35:30,320
So now he's managing,

3802
01:35:30,321 --> 01:35:32,330
now he's taking care of
fighters and stuff like that.

3803
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:33,230
But he's a real legend.

3804
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,210
Well leads a piece to Spec the SPEC.

3805
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,760
He's the guy,

3806
01:35:37,761 --> 01:35:39,740
he's the guy that I think talks for him.

3807
01:35:39,741 --> 01:35:40,401
Paula a lot.

3808
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,330
Cause yeah he paused.

3809
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,330
I respect him trying to
learn English as well.

3810
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:45,820
That's one of the reasons I was like Ah,

3811
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:48,380
I really want you to ride all the way
cause he was talking all this shit.

3812
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:48,681
Right.

3813
01:35:48,681 --> 01:35:49,514
If you wins,

3814
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:52,070
I want to see him and I want to
add the bill up for that fight.

3815
01:35:52,071 --> 01:35:52,900
Will be fun cause I,

3816
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:53,750
I will fuck him up.

3817
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:56,680
You felt like there was holes in
your rise came they looked at,

3818
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:57,560
you're saying that it was like,

3819
01:35:58,830 --> 01:35:59,140
yeah,

3820
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:00,740
and Paul and Paul's game as well.

3821
01:36:00,741 --> 01:36:01,491
There's holes in his game.

3822
01:36:01,491 --> 01:36:01,701
Boy.

3823
01:36:01,701 --> 01:36:02,640
What did you see in Paulo?

3824
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:05,870
He gets hit easily and you don't want,

3825
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:07,270
you know how you ride with tat?

3826
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,120
Tapping Him with a jab.

3827
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:09,130
He doesn't want it.

3828
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:10,310
If I was behind those jabs,

3829
01:36:10,311 --> 01:36:11,300
it'd be different setups.

3830
01:36:11,810 --> 01:36:12,621
It'd be a different setup.

3831
01:36:12,621 --> 01:36:16,010
I can come up with a few
other pathways after that Jab,

3832
01:36:16,011 --> 01:36:17,090
like your ride was hitting the jab,

3833
01:36:17,091 --> 01:36:17,550
but that's it.

3834
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:19,930
Hit the Japanese chins
up and hit the Japanese.

3835
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:21,290
What do you do after the Jab?

3836
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:22,610
After you landed seven times,

3837
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:23,660
you've got to do something else with it.

3838
01:36:24,050 --> 01:36:25,100
You can't just keep jabbing them,

3839
01:36:25,101 --> 01:36:28,820
jabbing him if he wants close to had
extreme confidence in his ability to knock

3840
01:36:28,821 --> 01:36:29,360
out your room.

3841
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,400
He didn't respect this jab.

3842
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:31,610
He will respect my jab.

3843
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,193
I look at my knuckle.

3844
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:34,430
So this is my most smokers,

3845
01:36:34,431 --> 01:36:35,300
my regular knuckle.

3846
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:40,790
So this one's a little far
and son now that's from him.

3847
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:41,450
What's his name?

3848
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:43,130
It got a little bit
more swollen because of,

3849
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:43,820
um,

3850
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:44,810
Brad to virus.

3851
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:49,280
This is my regular and local and like
I was jabbing him at first pres swollen

3852
01:36:49,281 --> 01:36:51,560
right now from the fight a little bit,

3853
01:36:51,561 --> 01:36:56,561
but normally it's just cause that's
how it is a triple double knuckle.

3854
01:36:56,661 --> 01:36:58,920
That's a triple Chihuahua.

3855
01:36:58,980 --> 01:36:59,280
Yeah.

3856
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,080
But yeah,

3857
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:00,720
with Brighton,

3858
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:01,650
the beginning of my jab,

3859
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,710
he was slipping it and I was like,

3860
01:37:03,711 --> 01:37:03,890
all right.

3861
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:05,000
And then you just said drop it down.

3862
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:08,300
And at one point he tried to counter it
like Tyrone Spong slipped the jabbing

3863
01:37:08,301 --> 01:37:09,290
count and counter.

3864
01:37:09,291 --> 01:37:10,070
But um,

3865
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:10,970
I recognized that.

3866
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:11,661
I was like,

3867
01:37:11,661 --> 01:37:11,871
okay,

3868
01:37:11,871 --> 01:37:12,620
cool.

3869
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,281
Drop it down.

3870
01:37:13,281 --> 01:37:14,280
And I hit him with,

3871
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:17,510
I think I went down to the legs and
that took away attention from the top.

3872
01:37:17,511 --> 01:37:20,300
Then I was able to go back to the
JAP and not busted him with the Jab.

3873
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:21,410
Now when you're training,

3874
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:21,950
um,

3875
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:22,470
Dee Dee,

3876
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:25,970
do you spend time to work
on traditional moves?

3877
01:37:25,971 --> 01:37:29,810
Like we'll kicks and side kicks on the
shit that you throw occasionally or do

3878
01:37:29,811 --> 01:37:34,250
you throw them into your overall pad
work game or how do the pad work?

3879
01:37:34,251 --> 01:37:34,611
Eugene,

3880
01:37:34,611 --> 01:37:36,410
he has his own system and he,

3881
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:37,370
he knows what he,

3882
01:37:37,371 --> 01:37:38,300
everyone's different.

3883
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:41,240
So he treats every fight as an individual,

3884
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:41,990
you know what I mean?

3885
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:42,880
So he knows what me,

3886
01:37:42,881 --> 01:37:45,410
what he can do on the pads
and what I like to pull.

3887
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:46,880
And if I have an idea like,

3888
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:47,181
oh,

3889
01:37:47,181 --> 01:37:48,014
try this out.

3890
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:48,860
He's open.

3891
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:50,300
He's not like he's,

3892
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:50,550
he's,

3893
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:51,351
he's very open man.

3894
01:37:51,351 --> 01:37:52,184
He doesn't understand.

3895
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:52,790
He doesn't know.

3896
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:55,830
I'm trying to limit you from what
you can or what you can create.

3897
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:57,540
So all the spinning stuff,

3898
01:37:57,541 --> 01:37:59,970
all the creativity of the things
that I kind of bring myself,

3899
01:37:59,971 --> 01:38:04,770
I try just to am just walking around
my house shadowboxing sometimes,

3900
01:38:04,771 --> 01:38:04,981
you know,

3901
01:38:04,981 --> 01:38:05,860
just uh,

3902
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:06,810
my own free time.

3903
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:07,350
I might,

3904
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:11,710
I just think about certain things like
how can I do this different if it's

3905
01:38:11,711 --> 01:38:12,720
someone like Chad Mendez,

3906
01:38:12,721 --> 01:38:14,010
there's something he does like the,

3907
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:15,300
he fakes the shot an uppercut.

3908
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,670
I liked that we're complete
different body types,

3909
01:38:17,890 --> 01:38:18,631
but I like that.

3910
01:38:18,631 --> 01:38:23,100
And I have my own setups for that just
cause I feel like it's a good move but

3911
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:25,140
with different body types
and he has his own set up.

3912
01:38:25,141 --> 01:38:27,000
So I like to create on my own.

3913
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:31,110
And then if I have any ideas or anything
that I feel I can work well with the

3914
01:38:31,111 --> 01:38:31,831
pads are with our,

3915
01:38:31,831 --> 01:38:32,670
with our flow,

3916
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:34,320
I'll let him know and he's open to it.

3917
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:38,810
Well you're one of these
guys that's coming up right
now that's in this new wave

3918
01:38:38,811 --> 01:38:41,930
of MMA fighters that is every,

3919
01:38:41,931 --> 01:38:45,260
it seems to me that there's like an
incremental increase in the skill level.

3920
01:38:45,261 --> 01:38:48,560
There's always all time greats
like Cain Velasquez and you know,

3921
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:49,671
fill in the blank.

3922
01:38:49,671 --> 01:38:50,810
There's like Anderson Silver,

3923
01:38:50,811 --> 01:38:52,440
there's these guys that
burst out and they,

3924
01:38:52,441 --> 01:38:52,651
they,

3925
01:38:52,651 --> 01:38:52,911
they,

3926
01:38:52,911 --> 01:38:56,270
they stand out as a extreme performers.

3927
01:38:56,660 --> 01:39:00,070
But there seems to me like
right now to be a new witness,

3928
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,670
Zap beat mega man's sharp,

3929
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:03,770
sharp off that guy.

3930
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,380
There's a few of these guys
that are coming up where
you're watching and you go,

3931
01:39:06,381 --> 01:39:07,280
Whoa,

3932
01:39:07,281 --> 01:39:10,130
this is some next level you
recognize like a guy like me.

3933
01:39:10,131 --> 01:39:11,360
It was seen it for so many years.

3934
01:39:11,361 --> 01:39:11,571
I go,

3935
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:11,871
okay,

3936
01:39:11,871 --> 01:39:13,730
there's some next level
shit going on right now.

3937
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,073
It's like a,

3938
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,980
like we're talking about Loma Chenko
like Gloma goes footwork and movement.

3939
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:19,521
This is okay.

3940
01:39:19,521 --> 01:39:20,660
This is next level shit.

3941
01:39:20,661 --> 01:39:21,500
I've seen a lot.

3942
01:39:21,650 --> 01:39:24,200
I mean I'm sure there's
been some all time greats.

3943
01:39:24,201 --> 01:39:24,531
When you,

3944
01:39:24,531 --> 01:39:24,920
you,

3945
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:28,220
when you go to guys like Pernell
Whitaker and guys like Floyd Mayweather,

3946
01:39:28,430 --> 01:39:28,760
you know,

3947
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,020
artistic geniuses,

3948
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:33,320
but there's something that Loma Chanko
is doing that they're not doing right.

3949
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:34,700
Hundred percent like it for some things.

3950
01:39:34,701 --> 01:39:35,930
I watched his footwork,

3951
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:37,790
I watched the way he looks like,

3952
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:39,830
and you see my fight as well.

3953
01:39:39,831 --> 01:39:40,790
I like to look at guys.

3954
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:43,130
I don't just like close my
eyes and hope throwing hope.

3955
01:39:43,131 --> 01:39:44,430
I don't throw a note by Ayman fire.

3956
01:39:44,431 --> 01:39:45,141
That's one of my quotes.

3957
01:39:45,141 --> 01:39:45,890
I say that,

3958
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:47,030
but he does the same thing.

3959
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:49,700
He likes to look and he's
aware of where he is.

3960
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:50,870
He's crunching.

3961
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:51,230
Yeah,

3962
01:39:51,230 --> 01:39:52,130
100% chunking,

3963
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:52,640
chunking,

3964
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:53,630
all that inflammation.

3965
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:55,430
Muscle memory.

3966
01:39:55,870 --> 01:39:56,121
Like I say,

3967
01:39:56,121 --> 01:39:56,631
he's a dancer.

3968
01:39:56,631 --> 01:39:57,650
You'd learn what the boys have,

3969
01:39:57,651 --> 01:39:58,400
ballet,

3970
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,031
all that stuff.

3971
01:39:59,031 --> 01:39:59,570
Rhythm,

3972
01:39:59,570 --> 01:40:01,760
timing off beat on beat.

3973
01:40:02,510 --> 01:40:05,900
It all translates well
into fighting like easily.

3974
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:06,440
Yeah,

3975
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:07,280
it really does.

3976
01:40:07,281 --> 01:40:12,281
And it's so fascinating to me and
watching all these like new versions of

3977
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:15,470
different styles like
Khabib in my opinion,

3978
01:40:15,471 --> 01:40:17,840
it is a new version of the
ground and pound style.

3979
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:19,580
I watch his ground and pound.

3980
01:40:19,581 --> 01:40:21,350
I'm like Jesus fucking Christ.

3981
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:22,130
Like he's such a,

3982
01:40:22,130 --> 01:40:23,480
like when he fought Michael Johnson,

3983
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:25,580
there's don't just engage
you fight their son.

3984
01:40:25,581 --> 01:40:30,530
This is a Mauler Goddamn mauling he
getting mauled by some crazy alien from

3985
01:40:30,531 --> 01:40:31,240
another planet.

3986
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:32,830
I liked the way it traps
the hands and I had,

3987
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,150
I had one of them Brad as well,

3988
01:40:34,330 --> 01:40:34,871
a little bit,

3989
01:40:34,871 --> 01:40:36,610
but I think he recognized
that he tried to go away.

3990
01:40:36,611 --> 01:40:38,340
This is when I had his
back for a brief moment,

3991
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:41,620
that five probably about a good
30 seconds and I tapped his hand.

3992
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:42,040
Um,

3993
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:43,630
I learned that from Bjj Scout.

3994
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:45,400
That was on the Ben ask and video.

3995
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:47,400
But Brad wouldn't let
me have his right hand.

3996
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:48,311
I got it though.

3997
01:40:48,311 --> 01:40:49,450
Cause like my God,

3998
01:40:49,451 --> 01:40:52,900
these fucking monkey fingers like I
can grip the hoc and grip very well.

3999
01:40:52,901 --> 01:40:55,300
So hold it and not
pepper them a little bit.

4000
01:40:55,301 --> 01:40:57,670
And then that's when I kind of got
to the fence and something happened.

4001
01:40:58,090 --> 01:41:00,790
Got a Kamora but I picked
from everyone could be,

4002
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:03,430
there's a way he traps the hands
and we call it the [inaudible].

4003
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:03,821
Everyone.

4004
01:41:03,821 --> 01:41:04,330
I,

4005
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:04,640
I,

4006
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,300
when I get to my train apart and I
started talking like you would never get

4007
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:07,870
this,

4008
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:08,980
I want to stifle short.

4009
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:09,251
You know,

4010
01:41:09,251 --> 01:41:13,510
I just kind of like guys like that just
because they're good at what they do and

4011
01:41:13,511 --> 01:41:15,460
if I can get it and make it work for me,

4012
01:41:15,461 --> 01:41:17,080
like Bruce Lee make it my own.

4013
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,910
I'm really intrigued.

4014
01:41:18,911 --> 01:41:22,090
I mean I'm just really bummed out that
Max Holloway had to pull out of that

4015
01:41:22,091 --> 01:41:22,924
fight.

4016
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:25,030
Michael Bisping called
them out on that though,

4017
01:41:25,031 --> 01:41:25,271
man.

4018
01:41:25,271 --> 01:41:27,400
Cause I think most other people
would have just kinda like,

4019
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:28,091
oh well cool,

4020
01:41:28,091 --> 01:41:28,391
good luck.

4021
01:41:28,391 --> 01:41:29,890
But he called him out on TV light,

4022
01:41:29,891 --> 01:41:30,161
Bro.

4023
01:41:30,161 --> 01:41:32,920
You look like you just woke up and
you can tell he recognized something.

4024
01:41:34,090 --> 01:41:35,690
Cause I heard about it before
I watched the interview.

4025
01:41:35,691 --> 01:41:36,160
Then I was like,

4026
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,200
oh obviously I didn't look at him.

4027
01:41:38,201 --> 01:41:38,860
He's just like,

4028
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:39,131
uh,

4029
01:41:39,131 --> 01:41:39,461
you know,

4030
01:41:39,461 --> 01:41:40,294
I feel great,

4031
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:41,643
blah blah blah.

4032
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:42,780
Yeah,

4033
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:44,200
facts and he would have fought,

4034
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:45,880
he would've rehydrate it and forth.

4035
01:41:45,910 --> 01:41:47,350
Maybe not to the best of his ability,

4036
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:50,100
but he might've got knocked
out and then safety,

4037
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:50,431
sorry,

4038
01:41:50,431 --> 01:41:52,510
the punching at night or take is no joke,

4039
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:53,020
no joke.

4040
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:53,350
You know,

4041
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:56,050
and you don't want to come against and
go up against a guy like that and be

4042
01:41:56,051 --> 01:41:56,530
slack.

4043
01:41:56,530 --> 01:42:00,820
He should go to lightweight or take
is fascinating to me because his,

4044
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:05,800
the way he locks up submissions
is so next level long range.

4045
01:42:05,801 --> 01:42:08,530
I like churches that the
technique is so sharp.

4046
01:42:08,531 --> 01:42:09,100
Man.

4047
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:10,120
When he dives on Shit,

4048
01:42:10,121 --> 01:42:13,690
when he got caught up in that he got them
in a dark at the end of the second of

4049
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:14,231
the first round.

4050
01:42:14,231 --> 01:42:14,680
I was like,

4051
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:15,700
what the fuck man,

4052
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:17,170
that is tight like,

4053
01:42:17,171 --> 01:42:19,720
but there was something
about the finality to it.

4054
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:20,171
There's like,

4055
01:42:20,171 --> 01:42:20,561
this is,

4056
01:42:20,561 --> 01:42:22,720
this is not a question of whether
or not we're going to finish it.

4057
01:42:23,030 --> 01:42:23,770
Well it was,

4058
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:25,030
it was not that it was this,

4059
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:27,700
the solidity of the technique.

4060
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,350
It was like when he locked it in,

4061
01:42:29,530 --> 01:42:34,070
there was no doubt this fight was like
the bell rang and then I was like see

4062
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:36,310
some guys slippery.

4063
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,620
It's wasn't like maybe
he's going to get out,

4064
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:40,180
you know a guy gets a
good team and it's like,

4065
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:41,103
oh

4066
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:43,660
this wasn't that,

4067
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:44,600
this was death.

4068
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:44,920
Okay.

4069
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,290
And then he got him into a gay teen,

4070
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:47,290
jumped on this guard,

4071
01:42:47,630 --> 01:42:48,670
jumped in and got them in the GTA.

4072
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:49,420
It's beautiful.

4073
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:50,590
That kind of stuff like I'll take,

4074
01:42:50,610 --> 01:42:51,520
I liked the way he looks.

4075
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:56,530
I look at guys like that cause similar
body types and lately I've been catching

4076
01:42:56,531 --> 01:43:00,690
that you see in the fifth round gimme
another maybe seven seconds I would

4077
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:01,540
squeeze that.

4078
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:03,160
But the writing on the sweat on the belt,

4079
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:07,300
but every time someone goes for
certain things I can snatch the neck.

4080
01:43:07,301 --> 01:43:07,721
But thing is,

4081
01:43:07,721 --> 01:43:11,080
I don't have that w the way or take it
has where he knows like okay it's done.

4082
01:43:11,090 --> 01:43:11,923
Like for me I'm like,

4083
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:13,150
I think it's tight.

4084
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:14,110
Let me try it.

4085
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:15,370
I know how it is,

4086
01:43:15,371 --> 01:43:15,641
right?

4087
01:43:15,641 --> 01:43:19,720
If like if you tried to throw a jab hook
with one hand and then throw it with

4088
01:43:19,721 --> 01:43:20,111
the other hand,

4089
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:21,700
it just doesn't feel
right with the other hand.

4090
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:23,963
I'm bystanders,

4091
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:30,400
but you know some people from
my own personal experience,

4092
01:43:30,401 --> 01:43:31,121
my left hand,

4093
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:32,260
I know how to do it with my left side,

4094
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:34,150
but my right side it feels like awkward.

4095
01:43:34,370 --> 01:43:38,470
But there's a squeeze that you develop
a certain guys just get like this

4096
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:39,480
Marcello Garcia style squeeze.

4097
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:40,840
Got It.

4098
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:41,440
I want that.

4099
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:41,861
That's the thing,

4100
01:43:41,861 --> 01:43:43,320
cause I know I've got a,

4101
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:44,970
I can catch the neck but there is,

4102
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:46,300
when I catch it I'm not,

4103
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:48,670
I'm not dead set short
like okay it's over now.

4104
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:49,810
Like feed the Hay.

4105
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,100
If you don't tap you're going to sleep.

4106
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:53,510
But I want this tab to a
certain amount of black belts.

4107
01:43:53,511 --> 01:43:55,230
With that you would
have that feeling right?

4108
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:55,640
He does,

4109
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:56,210
yeah.

4110
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:57,530
He's a beast man.

4111
01:43:57,890 --> 01:43:58,723
He's a beast.

4112
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:01,370
He's so fucking explosive on the ground.

4113
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,880
He throws up triangles and the bars.

4114
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:05,300
I like his creativity as well.

4115
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:05,750
Yeah,

4116
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:06,950
he thinks outside the box.

4117
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:11,180
Well knocking out Frankie was giant
and hitting them with an upper cut like

4118
01:44:11,181 --> 01:44:11,750
that.

4119
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:12,250
Whoa.

4120
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:13,083
I didn't know where.

4121
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:14,050
It's just a,

4122
01:44:14,450 --> 01:44:17,690
Frankie can take it to Frankie
fighting at Atlantic city after that.

4123
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:18,390
Uh,

4124
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:19,011
just like a,

4125
01:44:19,011 --> 01:44:19,161
yeah,

4126
01:44:19,161 --> 01:44:23,570
a few weeks after or four weeks after
that was he fucked cub Swanson a change

4127
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:25,790
his fight to take care of
getting knocked out by Ortega.

4128
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:26,420
Fuck.

4129
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:27,320
What do you think about that?

4130
01:44:27,321 --> 01:44:28,250
About guys doing that?

4131
01:44:28,251 --> 01:44:29,090
Like getting stock.

4132
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:31,100
Same take time off after that.

4133
01:44:31,101 --> 01:44:32,540
I'm not kind of in Brazil,

4134
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:33,800
I took about,

4135
01:44:34,540 --> 01:44:37,580
I fought again in July mean you
totally unconscious in that fight.

4136
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:37,880
Yeah,

4137
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:38,181
I remember.

4138
01:44:38,181 --> 01:44:38,331
Okay.

4139
01:44:38,331 --> 01:44:38,811
So I remember,

4140
01:44:38,811 --> 01:44:39,644
this is what happened.

4141
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,540
I woke up and was like,

4142
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:42,020
Oh shit,

4143
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:42,320
okay,

4144
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:43,153
let me try and get up.

4145
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:43,971
Fuck.

4146
01:44:43,971 --> 01:44:46,100
Moms just felt like noodles or whatever.

4147
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:49,100
And then this kid is
fucking little shithead.

4148
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,140
Like a baby came over and just like,

4149
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:53,690
I didn't either yelled at my
face or whatever and I was like,

4150
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:54,141
whatever.

4151
01:44:54,141 --> 01:44:54,350
I don't,

4152
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:55,520
and then because it's Brazil,

4153
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:56,691
he'd go crazy.

4154
01:44:56,691 --> 01:44:57,471
Like Holy Shit,

4155
01:44:57,471 --> 01:44:58,304
he knocked this guy out.

4156
01:44:58,550 --> 01:45:00,230
So when then where was
the kid like near you?

4157
01:45:00,231 --> 01:45:01,064
By the cake.

4158
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,900
He came in the rain and then the referee,

4159
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:04,850
the referee had to like,

4160
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:06,800
Yo everyone get order again.

4161
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:09,050
There was chaos and this is
while they were doing the count.

4162
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:09,620
Yeah.

4163
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:10,580
And then I was trying to get up,

4164
01:45:10,581 --> 01:45:12,350
I was trying to get up and then like not,

4165
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,060
and I think it was just over after that.

4166
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,080
Then I had,

4167
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:15,651
okay,

4168
01:45:15,651 --> 01:45:16,040
cool,

4169
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:16,850
good flight.

4170
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:17,530
Give him a,

4171
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:18,260
what do you call it?

4172
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:19,093
Fist pound.

4173
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:22,180
And then the kid again came over next
to me and just laid on the ground.

4174
01:45:22,181 --> 01:45:23,014
It's like,

4175
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:24,193
and I thought,

4176
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:24,770
yeah,

4177
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:25,910
I'll stomp his face.

4178
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:26,570
Bother now.

4179
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:27,440
How old was the kid?

4180
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:28,630
Seven.

4181
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:30,820
I don't give a fuck if
you can crawl the can bro.

4182
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:34,280
Shout out to Michael Blackson

4183
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:36,893
but a

4184
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:39,370
broad ties.

4185
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,850
Fucking hilarious.

4186
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:41,480
But uh,

4187
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:41,691
yeah.

4188
01:45:41,691 --> 01:45:43,100
And then I remember like ruthless.

4189
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:43,370
No,

4190
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:44,600
but then I was like,

4191
01:45:44,610 --> 01:45:45,620
it was a dick move,

4192
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:47,180
but at the time and I'll,

4193
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:48,360
yeah,

4194
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:48,590
yeah,

4195
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:50,630
that was that his kid,

4196
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:51,051
I don't know.

4197
01:45:51,051 --> 01:45:52,070
He could go either way.

4198
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,700
If your dad don't spank
you or I'll spank you.

4199
01:45:56,230 --> 01:45:57,063
That's hilarious.

4200
01:45:57,110 --> 01:45:59,180
But then I remember like flashes as well,

4201
01:45:59,210 --> 01:46:00,043
walking out.

4202
01:46:00,570 --> 01:46:01,550
We usually to steam.

4203
01:46:01,551 --> 01:46:02,301
They walked outside,

4204
01:46:02,301 --> 01:46:04,960
we just sat there and I was in prison.

4205
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:05,240
I said,

4206
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:05,751
what happened?

4207
01:46:05,751 --> 01:46:06,740
And he just told me what happened.

4208
01:46:06,741 --> 01:46:06,981
I was like,

4209
01:46:06,981 --> 01:46:07,760
all right,

4210
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:08,593
okay.

4211
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:13,460
And then I remember back in the
hotel chilling and then yeah,

4212
01:46:13,461 --> 01:46:14,091
I felt like,

4213
01:46:14,091 --> 01:46:14,480
fuck,

4214
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:15,313
I'm okay.

4215
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,590
This is the worst of
the worst case scenario.

4216
01:46:18,591 --> 01:46:19,131
I'm okay.

4217
01:46:19,131 --> 01:46:22,670
And that was my first only ever
knock out lost and I was just like,

4218
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:23,420
fine,

4219
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:23,750
that's,

4220
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:26,480
you think you learned something in
that fight about not giving into your

4221
01:46:26,481 --> 01:46:27,170
emotions.

4222
01:46:27,170 --> 01:46:29,360
And I just don't let people like people,

4223
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:30,223
you're the man,

4224
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:33,050
you ain't shit now I don't give a fuck.

4225
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:35,510
Like I only give a fuck
about those who I care about.

4226
01:46:35,511 --> 01:46:38,030
Like someone like ash or Eugene,

4227
01:46:38,031 --> 01:46:38,310
those my,

4228
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:39,051
my close people,

4229
01:46:39,051 --> 01:46:41,700
if they say something
about me that hurts me,

4230
01:46:41,890 --> 01:46:43,640
then I'll give a fuck
boy for someone like,

4231
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:44,751
oh bro,

4232
01:46:44,751 --> 01:46:45,320
you're the man,

4233
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:47,480
this that boy you got
to blah blah blah blah,

4234
01:46:47,481 --> 01:46:47,661
blah,

4235
01:46:47,661 --> 01:46:47,811
blah,

4236
01:46:47,811 --> 01:46:48,110
blah,

4237
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:49,280
or be more this.

4238
01:46:49,290 --> 01:46:50,100
I'm like,

4239
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:50,460
cool.

4240
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:52,710
I just smile and wave because I
don't give a fuck what they think.

4241
01:46:52,711 --> 01:46:53,670
They are no one to me.

4242
01:46:53,671 --> 01:46:54,241
You don't understand.

4243
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:54,961
So yeah,

4244
01:46:54,961 --> 01:46:56,070
after that fight I shouldn't,

4245
01:46:56,071 --> 01:46:59,160
I shouldn't have given into
people's opinions of myself.

4246
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:02,000
I should have stayed true to me and
just fucked him up in the second round.

4247
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:04,800
I would have knocked them out if I
just didn't literally just right hands.

4248
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:06,090
Why am I only throwing right hand?

4249
01:47:06,091 --> 01:47:09,030
So I think that's like a like a
critical lesson in your career.

4250
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:09,630
Facts.

4251
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:10,500
I'm glad it happened.

4252
01:47:10,530 --> 01:47:11,700
Like in the,

4253
01:47:11,701 --> 01:47:12,840
in the moment know hindsight.

4254
01:47:12,841 --> 01:47:15,420
It's like Oh fuck sucks and I hate losing.

4255
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:17,070
I fucking hate losing one thing.

4256
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:21,420
I went 40 and oh before I had my first
loss and that was the assignment markers.

4257
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,201
Bahti boys,

4258
01:47:22,201 --> 01:47:22,480
cyber,

4259
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:23,810
Marcus like any,

4260
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:25,020
I beat him in that fight as well.

4261
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:28,620
But another judge like
all three rounds of beast,

4262
01:47:28,890 --> 01:47:31,800
I beat him all three rounds
and then the extra rent,

4263
01:47:31,801 --> 01:47:33,620
a big fight to win extra round.

4264
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:35,460
They made an extra round and the extra,

4265
01:47:35,461 --> 01:47:37,800
I still beat him but then they gave it
to him cause he was a superstar at the

4266
01:47:37,801 --> 01:47:39,870
time and I realized,

4267
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:41,190
Oh shit,

4268
01:47:41,191 --> 01:47:41,700
I lost.

4269
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:43,950
Okay I live my life and that was it.

4270
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:47,010
But I took Winnie for granted for so
long and kickboxing because I was always

4271
01:47:47,011 --> 01:47:47,844
expecting to win.

4272
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:48,451
And after that,

4273
01:47:48,451 --> 01:47:49,200
after a fire.

4274
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:49,411
Okay,

4275
01:47:49,411 --> 01:47:50,244
what's next?

4276
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:50,910
Cool.

4277
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:52,260
I watched the fight maybe twice,

4278
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:52,871
maybe even once,

4279
01:47:52,871 --> 01:47:54,420
some time when he wants to
fight and then that's it.

4280
01:47:54,421 --> 01:47:55,254
What's next?

4281
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:59,260
But this weekend ever since I go to
the UFC or just before every show,

4282
01:47:59,310 --> 01:48:00,820
every single floor after I went out,

4283
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:01,320
cause my,

4284
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:03,300
my brain tries to go to
that place where it's like,

4285
01:48:03,301 --> 01:48:04,980
okay what's next?

4286
01:48:04,981 --> 01:48:05,700
By like wait,

4287
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:06,990
stop Nigga.

4288
01:48:06,991 --> 01:48:09,060
You just main evented in Vegas,

4289
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:10,140
your first flight,

4290
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:14,130
smoke this dude all five rounds and
you're on top of the world right now.

4291
01:48:14,190 --> 01:48:15,650
Take this end that's all.

4292
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:17,640
Sit Down and look at the t
mobile arena and just like,

4293
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:19,530
I might've been a little area as well.

4294
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:23,460
You just go myself and then just get
like you get objective and I sit down,

4295
01:48:23,461 --> 01:48:24,720
I just like let it sink in.

4296
01:48:24,721 --> 01:48:25,554
Like Yo,

4297
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:27,001
you're out here,

4298
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:29,730
you're doing the damn thing
and really embrace it.

4299
01:48:29,890 --> 01:48:34,230
And eventually when I go back home and I
let things settle down and I moved back

4300
01:48:34,231 --> 01:48:35,041
into the flow of things,

4301
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:35,191
I,

4302
01:48:35,191 --> 01:48:36,420
I'll start to get over it.

4303
01:48:36,421 --> 01:48:37,350
But the one thing I forgot,

4304
01:48:37,351 --> 01:48:38,610
you smell the roses,

4305
01:48:38,611 --> 01:48:41,310
just stop sometimes and smell the
roses and it's not called kids,

4306
01:48:41,311 --> 01:48:41,940
not,

4307
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:44,970
it's just appreciating what you've done
because you've put a lot of work into

4308
01:48:44,971 --> 01:48:45,151
this,

4309
01:48:45,151 --> 01:48:45,880
you know?

4310
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:46,650
Yeah.

4311
01:48:46,650 --> 01:48:47,970
That's a good attitude man.

4312
01:48:47,971 --> 01:48:52,140
I mean I think what you're doing in terms
of your ability to reflect on yourself

4313
01:48:52,141 --> 01:48:54,900
and to be really objective
about your abilities,

4314
01:48:55,150 --> 01:48:56,430
want to grow your podcast.

4315
01:48:56,431 --> 01:48:57,410
The one thing he said when I was at,

4316
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:00,450
cause I don't have any big brothers so
I don't really have anyone Sunday me

4317
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:01,500
apart from Eugene and like,

4318
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,130
but sometimes not.

4319
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:05,040
When I first started
listening to you tell,

4320
01:49:05,041 --> 01:49:05,371
he's like,

4321
01:49:05,371 --> 01:49:06,150
don't be a bitch.

4322
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:10,170
You had this like big rent one time
if you want to do this and do that,

4323
01:49:10,171 --> 01:49:11,400
I follow your dreams and like,

4324
01:49:11,530 --> 01:49:11,910
you know,

4325
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:13,080
don't be a bitch.

4326
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:13,830
Yeah,

4327
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:14,101
bitch.

4328
01:49:14,101 --> 01:49:14,430
Yeah.

4329
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:15,690
Everybody has an inner bitch.

4330
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:16,261
I know.

4331
01:49:16,261 --> 01:49:17,094
Tell me about it.

4332
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:20,880
I'm a bitch in the streets for voice.

4333
01:49:20,881 --> 01:49:21,450
Yeah.

4334
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:22,050
And I'm like,

4335
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:22,500
yeah,

4336
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:23,390
like it,

4337
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,440
part of that was part of the fuel that
helped me amongst a lot of other things.

4338
01:49:27,441 --> 01:49:30,630
I take inspiration from everything
to help me like get out of that.

4339
01:49:30,631 --> 01:49:31,464
But I remember the date,

4340
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:33,330
September 4th,

4341
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:33,811
2013 I was just like,

4342
01:49:33,811 --> 01:49:34,170
Yup,

4343
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:34,890
I'm out.

4344
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:35,401
And I'll never,

4345
01:49:35,401 --> 01:49:36,121
I'll never looked.

4346
01:49:36,121 --> 01:49:37,440
I never worked a day in my life again.

4347
01:49:37,710 --> 01:49:38,340
Beautiful.

4348
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:39,060
Never again.

4349
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:39,880
I couldn't do it.

4350
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:40,450
Uh,

4351
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:42,230
there's one time I don't have to anymore.

4352
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:42,751
You're working,

4353
01:49:42,751 --> 01:49:44,790
but you're working at something
you have a passion towards.

4354
01:49:44,791 --> 01:49:45,750
You're still like work.

4355
01:49:45,751 --> 01:49:46,650
It doesn't feel like work.

4356
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:47,231
That's what I mean.

4357
01:49:47,231 --> 01:49:47,680
Like he did.

4358
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:49,150
I don't care if you're
working in the office,

4359
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:49,781
that's your thing.

4360
01:49:49,781 --> 01:49:52,210
If you don't feel like you're working
in or you have a passion for what you're

4361
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:52,391
doing,

4362
01:49:52,391 --> 01:49:53,130
just do that.

4363
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:53,530
Right.

4364
01:49:53,530 --> 01:49:54,550
But then like I said,

4365
01:49:54,551 --> 01:49:55,990
some guys who were
fighting and they don't,

4366
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:56,851
they just do it cause it's get,

4367
01:49:56,851 --> 01:49:59,110
it gets like Brendan Schaub he was
doing it because he's great at it,

4368
01:49:59,380 --> 01:49:59,951
pays the bills.

4369
01:49:59,951 --> 01:50:01,960
But now look at it and comedian podcast,

4370
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:03,010
he recognized it though.

4371
01:50:03,011 --> 01:50:07,330
He's a wise guy and that he recognized
there was this thing that he just,

4372
01:50:07,331 --> 01:50:11,170
did you go back to like his fight
with cro cop or some zero your fights.

4373
01:50:11,171 --> 01:50:13,780
He had a different attitude about fighting
and then he realized he didn't have

4374
01:50:13,781 --> 01:50:17,120
it anymore but he was still getting paid
well so he didn't know how to jump out.

4375
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:17,621
Exactly.

4376
01:50:17,621 --> 01:50:18,191
That's what I mean.

4377
01:50:18,191 --> 01:50:20,080
So if you're learning it
doesn't matter what it is,

4378
01:50:20,081 --> 01:50:21,220
just opt out.

4379
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:23,033
You helped him though.

4380
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:24,590
You know I listened to that.

4381
01:50:24,591 --> 01:50:25,930
I was cringing the whole time.

4382
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:26,810
But you had to.

4383
01:50:26,810 --> 01:50:27,011
Yeah.

4384
01:50:27,011 --> 01:50:28,150
That's why the guy love that guy.

4385
01:50:28,151 --> 01:50:29,140
He's like a brother to me.

4386
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:30,280
And tell him about who was on time.

4387
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:31,540
He wasn't all there.

4388
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:31,980
Yeah.

4389
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:33,850
Terms of like he wasn't all in facts.

4390
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:35,140
That's how all of homes all the time.

4391
01:50:35,141 --> 01:50:37,410
Cause a lot of people like they
don't know how to handle it.

4392
01:50:37,411 --> 01:50:40,150
Like not the new meat but
the new lifestyle around me.

4393
01:50:40,330 --> 01:50:41,530
It's where people get,

4394
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:42,693
they get,

4395
01:50:42,850 --> 01:50:46,330
they become like groupies on the in a way
I'm like [inaudible] it's spooky cause

4396
01:50:46,331 --> 01:50:47,164
you you don't mean,

4397
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:50,560
but you broke through the membrane
to the neighboring dimension.

4398
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:52,150
You know like Oh shit,

4399
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:53,800
stop vendors on TV.

4400
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:56,260
I get it.

4401
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:57,273
I get it.

4402
01:50:57,350 --> 01:51:00,100
It to people that know you and
then all sudden see you on TV.

4403
01:51:00,101 --> 01:51:01,480
That's a mind fuck man.

4404
01:51:02,410 --> 01:51:07,410
My first friends get on TV when I was
a comedian and watched him on TV gone,

4405
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:08,291
Whoa,

4406
01:51:08,291 --> 01:51:09,370
I kick me out.

4407
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,910
I know that guy and I
see him on TV fax that.

4408
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:12,221
But for me,

4409
01:51:12,221 --> 01:51:13,420
so the ones that are around me now,

4410
01:51:13,421 --> 01:51:14,560
they're the ones that can check me.

4411
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:16,450
Like if I feel up and they can check me.

4412
01:51:16,451 --> 01:51:17,151
Like if I fuck up,

4413
01:51:17,151 --> 01:51:18,580
like cause I'm not perfect.

4414
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:21,220
I mean it's not a soft no such thing.

4415
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:24,310
Like if I do something and
I'm like I'm in the wrong,

4416
01:51:24,311 --> 01:51:24,910
they'll tell him and like,

4417
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:26,410
hey you need to pull your head in.

4418
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:27,363
You know what I mean?

4419
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:28,600
So you need people like that.

4420
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:29,350
Yeah,

4421
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:30,760
I'm glad I have people like that now.

4422
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:31,540
Well,

4423
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:36,140
having people like that and also having
people like Dan Hooker and you camp

4424
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:38,950
having people like all the other
training partners you were talking about,

4425
01:51:38,951 --> 01:51:39,850
having great coaches,

4426
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:41,590
all those things have to be together.

4427
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:43,630
It's like you have to have
people that are honest,

4428
01:51:43,631 --> 01:51:44,381
that are assessing you.

4429
01:51:44,381 --> 01:51:45,310
You have to have a good,

4430
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:47,530
a good trainer who's looking at you,

4431
01:51:47,531 --> 01:51:48,364
who knows you.

4432
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:48,881
I was like,

4433
01:51:48,881 --> 01:51:49,810
you're a little off today.

4434
01:51:49,811 --> 01:51:51,970
Your little slow today or today
we're going to ramp it up.

4435
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:53,230
I think you're hitting the next level.

4436
01:51:53,231 --> 01:51:55,480
We're going to add in some
more different things.

4437
01:51:55,870 --> 01:51:57,550
Having someone who like to adjust.

4438
01:51:57,551 --> 01:52:00,490
And that's after everyone's
different individually,

4439
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:01,720
even with fighting the stuff.

4440
01:52:01,721 --> 01:52:03,100
So that's one thing I
love about our staff,

4441
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:04,080
uh,

4442
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:06,700
city kickboxing is because they
can look at someone and be like,

4443
01:52:06,701 --> 01:52:06,971
a cool,

4444
01:52:06,971 --> 01:52:07,631
he needs to do this.

4445
01:52:07,631 --> 01:52:08,560
He needs to work on this better.

4446
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:08,861
He knew,

4447
01:52:08,861 --> 01:52:09,011
you know,

4448
01:52:09,011 --> 01:52:09,844
and it's,

4449
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:10,871
it's beautiful.

4450
01:52:10,871 --> 01:52:12,880
I honestly like 2030 years from now,

4451
01:52:12,881 --> 01:52:13,810
I keep telling my team,

4452
01:52:13,811 --> 01:52:16,420
it's like they're going to talk
about us the way we talk about that.

4453
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:17,710
But the gym,

4454
01:52:17,711 --> 01:52:19,480
like when people talk about in who's Jim?

4455
01:52:19,481 --> 01:52:20,380
Whenever you're saying material,

4456
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:22,020
I've met him [inaudible],

4457
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:23,770
Andrea [inaudible] as well in China.

4458
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:24,731
He's a,

4459
01:52:24,731 --> 01:52:26,770
he's a kickboxing legend as well.

4460
01:52:26,771 --> 01:52:27,940
But yeah,

4461
01:52:28,030 --> 01:52:30,100
one day I'll go out there and
get some work work then probably.

4462
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:31,631
Yeah man.

4463
01:52:31,631 --> 01:52:32,740
I mean mix it up,

4464
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:33,890
try to like go out.

4465
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:35,561
I love New Zealand,

4466
01:52:35,561 --> 01:52:36,011
don't get me wrong.

4467
01:52:36,011 --> 01:52:36,310
When I,

4468
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:37,270
when I see the sky tower,

4469
01:52:37,271 --> 01:52:38,104
when I hit Oakland,

4470
01:52:38,110 --> 01:52:40,210
I get excited like a little
dog when it sees the park.

4471
01:52:40,211 --> 01:52:40,960
You know what I mean?

4472
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,890
I love being home,

4473
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,770
but it's good to get out there,

4474
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:46,130
get some work and without ego.

4475
01:52:46,131 --> 01:52:48,590
Cause one thing I realized now
is if I go to a different gym,

4476
01:52:48,591 --> 01:52:49,131
it'd be different.

4477
01:52:49,131 --> 01:52:52,150
Not because is always like
guy sparring my tribe.

4478
01:52:52,151 --> 01:52:52,580
It hurts your,

4479
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:53,740
exactly bro.

4480
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:54,080
Yeah.

4481
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:54,913
We can play,

4482
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:56,450
we can play.

4483
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:57,620
Well I don't get paid for that.

4484
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:58,260
That's the thing.

4485
01:52:58,260 --> 01:53:00,350
You were also in one of the
most beautiful countries.

4486
01:53:00,351 --> 01:53:01,190
It's ever existed.

4487
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:02,360
There's something about New Zealand,

4488
01:53:02,361 --> 01:53:02,571
man.

4489
01:53:02,571 --> 01:53:03,770
I said I've never been personally,

4490
01:53:03,771 --> 01:53:06,140
but there's a reason why
they filmed the hobbit there.

4491
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:09,080
Cause like you look at some of
that shit and it looks magical.

4492
01:53:10,110 --> 01:53:10,410
I,

4493
01:53:10,410 --> 01:53:11,390
it feels good to be like,

4494
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:12,620
I just love the vibe.

4495
01:53:12,621 --> 01:53:13,460
It's the vibe and using it,

4496
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:14,313
they're like,

4497
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:15,131
what is the vibe?

4498
01:53:15,131 --> 01:53:16,040
Like it's chill.

4499
01:53:16,150 --> 01:53:17,420
Everyone was real loose.

4500
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:17,841
Like,

4501
01:53:17,841 --> 01:53:19,310
and not like loose like Australia,

4502
01:53:19,311 --> 01:53:20,390
you can't get loose like that,

4503
01:53:20,391 --> 01:53:21,700
but it's relaxed.

4504
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:22,431
That's a different scene.

4505
01:53:22,431 --> 01:53:24,140
Loose like Australia and
loose like New Zealand.

4506
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:25,190
All the stress of loose Kahn's

4507
01:53:28,230 --> 01:53:29,600
like what's the difference man?

4508
01:53:29,601 --> 01:53:30,740
Bam drinks out of a shoe.

4509
01:53:31,230 --> 01:53:32,410
Oh yeah.

4510
01:53:32,540 --> 01:53:33,440
They don't give a fuck.

4511
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:34,151
He's like the,

4512
01:53:34,151 --> 01:53:35,710
the attitude and then their coolest.

4513
01:53:35,711 --> 01:53:36,351
Well it can be chill,

4514
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:37,670
but you can get some
real loose comes to that.

4515
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:38,840
I can use it in like in any way.

4516
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:39,683
Like in America,

4517
01:53:39,930 --> 01:53:40,210
you know,

4518
01:53:40,210 --> 01:53:41,043
but

4519
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:43,400
generically speaking light,

4520
01:53:43,401 --> 01:53:43,970
it's just,

4521
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:44,480
yeah,

4522
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:45,470
Australia is a,

4523
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:46,740
depends where he'd go.

4524
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:47,521
Melbourne's in my city,

4525
01:53:47,521 --> 01:53:48,560
that's my favorite city in Australia,

4526
01:53:48,561 --> 01:53:49,070
Melbourne,

4527
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:49,550
Perth,

4528
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:52,430
and then Adelaide because of my
favorite cities in that order.

4529
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,080
But yeah,

4530
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:54,681
I don't know.

4531
01:53:54,681 --> 01:53:56,480
I'll probably hit a few
other sports as well.

4532
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:57,720
See what the vibe is like.

4533
01:53:58,430 --> 01:53:58,860
Yeah.

4534
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:00,050
What about American gyms?

4535
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:01,190
How many different American gyms,

4536
01:54:01,191 --> 01:54:02,960
if you trained that
besides the black ceiling?

4537
01:54:03,110 --> 01:54:03,860
Zillions.

4538
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:05,170
Um Hm.

4539
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:06,283
Let me think.

4540
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:08,060
I've trained with a few fighters,

4541
01:54:08,061 --> 01:54:08,780
but um,

4542
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:09,920
maybe I've trained with,

4543
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:12,051
let me think.

4544
01:54:12,051 --> 01:54:14,780
Well I think that's the
only gym I didn't go to att.

4545
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:15,681
I,

4546
01:54:15,681 --> 01:54:17,050
I'm in La.

4547
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:17,893
Did I train?

4548
01:54:18,290 --> 01:54:19,760
Most of the Times I'm
here when I'm on holiday,

4549
01:54:19,761 --> 01:54:21,620
I don't train I holiday out.

4550
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:22,993
Yeah.

4551
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:23,480
Yeah.

4552
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:24,313
But um,

4553
01:54:24,410 --> 01:54:25,243
yeah.

4554
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:25,890
Um,

4555
01:54:25,890 --> 01:54:26,321
on the fly,

4556
01:54:26,321 --> 01:54:27,680
just train balance,

4557
01:54:27,681 --> 01:54:28,160
man.

4558
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:31,610
I tried once in a while
you'd go to too much.

4559
01:54:31,611 --> 01:54:32,720
This side you have to find it.

4560
01:54:32,721 --> 01:54:33,230
Okay.

4561
01:54:33,230 --> 01:54:34,063
Go to the other side.

4562
01:54:34,090 --> 01:54:36,740
It never stays right in the middle
for that for a long period of time.

4563
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:37,131
It's just like,

4564
01:54:37,131 --> 01:54:37,431
okay,

4565
01:54:37,431 --> 01:54:38,121
you're leaning this way,

4566
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:38,631
go this way.

4567
01:54:38,631 --> 01:54:39,170
All right.

4568
01:54:39,170 --> 01:54:39,981
And to find the balance.

4569
01:54:39,981 --> 01:54:41,630
So just feeling and being
honest with yourself.

4570
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:42,860
Objectivity.

4571
01:54:42,890 --> 01:54:46,610
I say always check yourself acy
always check yourself no matter what.

4572
01:54:46,611 --> 01:54:48,290
How you feeling until I,

4573
01:54:48,291 --> 01:54:51,420
if something gets me like maybe if
I see someone makes me feel a way,

4574
01:54:51,421 --> 01:54:52,011
like a jealous.

4575
01:54:52,011 --> 01:54:52,310
I'm like,

4576
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:53,143
what do I feel that way?

4577
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:53,881
I might want my,

4578
01:54:53,881 --> 01:54:54,471
what am I hating?

4579
01:54:54,471 --> 01:54:54,681
You know,

4580
01:54:54,681 --> 01:54:58,250
like it has nothing to do with me when
I find out where it comes from and then

4581
01:54:58,251 --> 01:55:00,440
eventually it's like you identified
the monster and then you,

4582
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,131
you slaughter it,

4583
01:55:01,131 --> 01:55:01,730
you kill it.

4584
01:55:01,730 --> 01:55:02,211
Good for you,

4585
01:55:02,211 --> 01:55:02,870
man.

4586
01:55:02,870 --> 01:55:03,590
Good for you.

4587
01:55:03,590 --> 01:55:04,350
I learned a lot.

4588
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:04,941
I'm coming up.

4589
01:55:04,941 --> 01:55:05,690
I'm learning.

4590
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:06,620
You're bad motherfucker.

4591
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:07,543
Listen man,

4592
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:08,760
I appreciate it.

4593
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:09,980
I'm glad we got a chance to do this.

4594
01:55:09,981 --> 01:55:10,814
Let's the first one.

4595
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:12,171
First one.

4596
01:55:12,171 --> 01:55:13,004
That's why

4597
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:15,980
I get more comfortable
with the way these go on,

4598
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:16,360
dude,

4599
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:17,150
you were great man.

4600
01:55:17,150 --> 01:55:17,660
It was fun.

4601
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:22,660
It was fun style bender on Twitter
style bender on Instagram everywhere.

4602
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:24,300
Catch sliding my dms everywhere.
