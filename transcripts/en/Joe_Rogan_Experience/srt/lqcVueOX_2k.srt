1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,141
Drive by day,

2
00:00:01,141 --> 00:00:02,850
Joe Rogan podcast by night,

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,920
all day they come in,

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,903
they weigh in.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,620
Then once we record it,

6
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,483
make sure they're cool,

7
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,780
they can rehydrate and they have many,

8
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:11,250
many more hours to rehydrate.

9
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,971
So guys,

10
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,220
we're rehydrating six hours earlier.

11
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,630
Most guys showed up at 10:00 AM they
made weight and then they had way more

12
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:18,871
time.

13
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:20,730
So when you saw people stand on the scale,

14
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,650
I was saying official weight,

15
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,670
when I was announcing it,

16
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,500
they had weighed in at 10
o'clock in the morning.

17
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,240
So it was already four in the afternoon.

18
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,670
These guys were hydrated and thick.

19
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:30,690
No one looks sick,

20
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,610
at least visually.

21
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,631
No one looked like,

22
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,740
like Conor McGregor looked when he fought
Chad Mendez when they weighed in and

23
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:37,620
he looked like a dead man.

24
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,073
A dead man.

25
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,830
S cheeks were all sucked in.

26
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:41,610
It looks horrible.

27
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,090
I mean,

28
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,331
look,

29
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,260
you did good in the fight.

30
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:43,860
Yeah,

31
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,370
but uh,

32
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,203
he really did.

33
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,120
He cuts a lot to get to one 45.

34
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:47,954
He's a big boy.

35
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,133
He's a big boy.

36
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,460
He's way bigger than,

37
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:50,850
um,

38
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,410
like chosen.

39
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,640
Aldo and Josie all was
cutting a lot at one point.

40
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:54,100
His career.

41
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,210
Oh,

42
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:54,541
by the way,

43
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,730
I've never a hardcore fan.

44
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:59,040
I've never enjoyed the fight
more than I enjoyed Nate Diaz.

45
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,761
Conor Mcgregor,

46
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:02,010
I was lost my mind so much
at the end of the fight.

47
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:02,310
I mean,

48
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,520
I'm a huge Diaz Fan and
that was just incredible.

49
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:05,761
I mean,

50
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:06,810
on 10 days notice.

51
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,410
Yup.

52
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,221
Well that whole,

53
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:08,670
um,

54
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,350
to card or that to fight,

55
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:10,860
um,

56
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,310
event,

57
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,330
the two fights,

58
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:12,480
uh,

59
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,313
the final fights,

60
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,071
the Holly Holm,

61
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:16,800
Miesha Tate was one of the most
exciting endings to any fight ever.

62
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,290
When Misha took Holly down in the fifth
round of fight where she was losing it,

63
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,420
took her back and choked her.

64
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,860
That's insane.

65
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,200
I read an article today where
someone was saying that it was,

66
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,791
that me,

67
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,510
she had lost virtually every second.

68
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:30,120
It was from a guy I respect a
writer and she won the second.

69
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:30,361
I was like,

70
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,050
what are you talking about?

71
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:31,621
The second round,

72
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,140
she took her down and pounded her.

73
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,320
I think they did they give her a 10,

74
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:35,220
eight yes.

75
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,660
And they should,

76
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,500
she dominated.

77
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,460
So I read this article,

78
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:40,080
this is ESPN writer
wrote it and I was like,

79
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:40,891
wait a minute man,

80
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:41,191
come on.

81
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:42,001
You can't say that like,

82
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:42,834
why are you saying that?

83
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,440
Like that's,

84
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,760
that's silly hyperbole,

85
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,180
right?

86
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,260
It doesn't even make any sense.

87
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,410
Um,

88
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,480
and me show it was threatening in
the third and fourth after that,

89
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,650
Holly was on her bike.

90
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:52,951
She was like,

91
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:53,784
fuck this.

92
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,320
Like she's fighting perfect and super
cautious with no chances and barely

93
00:01:58,321 --> 00:01:59,190
winning those rounds,

94
00:01:59,191 --> 00:01:59,371
you know,

95
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:00,670
just winning them but barely winning.

96
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,503
He wasn't nothing,

97
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,270
nothing big happened and
definitely no threat.

98
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,870
So that victory when
Misha Tate choked out,

99
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,580
Holly and Holly's punching in the air,

100
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,530
like how fucking dramatic is that going
out cold punching in the air while she's

101
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,290
going out.

102
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,490
And then Nate beating up Connor and that
second round after he gets fucked up in

103
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,324
the first round,

104
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,440
beating him up in the second
round and then choking him insane.

105
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,580
Probably like two,

106
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,800
two of the most exciting
finishes to any fight ever.

107
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,161
And the,

108
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:30,720
and the Connor thing was just insane
because he was on a tear that was one of

109
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:32,490
the biggest tears in MMA history.

110
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,743
And uh,

111
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,950
to watch it go down like that,

112
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:35,611
especially like you said,

113
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:39,030
like he was winning the fight and then
Nate turns it around and it was almost

114
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:40,440
like on a drop of a dime,

115
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:41,160
like nay,

116
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,580
nay,

117
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,730
like came to life in that second
round and starts talking shit.

118
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,830
So it was really fun
in a home for the Jab.

119
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,320
He hit him with that big
one too and it was like,

120
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:51,600
oh well they has a snake,

121
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:52,740
like one to two.

122
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,310
He like whap whap and then
he liked slithers around.

123
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:57,720
You can't find them with the counter.

124
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,800
He's really good.

125
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,430
And there's no one worse than a Nate
or Nick Diaz to get hurt by in a fight

126
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,900
because once they hurt you,

127
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,130
they just like,

128
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,700
they push a pace and then when you get
hurt they like pick it up and pick it up.

129
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:10,391
And then all of a sudden,

130
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,260
I mean before you know it,

131
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:15,310
Conner's hit like 25 fucking times on
the feet and he's shooting for a take

132
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:15,580
down.

133
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,350
Those guys are always doing triathlons.

134
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,700
So even though Nate is like you're taking
that fight in 11 days notice and he

135
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,570
wasn't in shape,

136
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,390
he's still in way better
shape than most people.

137
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,240
So like him going five
rounds is non feasible.

138
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,720
It's not,

139
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,820
it's not outside of the
realm of imagination.

140
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,863
He's in shape.

141
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,450
He's just not in the kind of shape
that he's going to be when they have a

142
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,350
rematch.

143
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,260
And that becomes a real fucking problem.

144
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,540
Cause I think he's going to
beat him up again with Nate sad.

145
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,310
He's like goes,

146
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:41,611
he goes,

147
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:41,880
I have,

148
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,540
if I had a camp we wouldn't
have fucking touch me.

149
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,021
He goes,

150
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:47,500
my plan was to go out slow in the first
round and he came out fast enough in the

151
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:48,220
first round.

152
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,540
So I got tagged a couple of times.

153
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,261
But that's so cool.

154
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:50,771
That's cool.

155
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:51,491
Stick to the plan,

156
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:52,324
stick to the plan.

157
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,880
And then the second round it
starts loosening up and opening up.

158
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,110
And Conor was just dead.

159
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,381
Yeah.

160
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:56,800
Well I heard,

161
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,210
I mean people are talking to Nate about,

162
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,751
cause you know,

163
00:03:58,751 --> 00:03:59,441
going into that fight,

164
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:00,550
like Connor's power,

165
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,630
it was what a lot of
people were talking about.

166
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:01,721
Like,

167
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:01,871
you know,

168
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:05,420
he put one punch on Josie Aldos
Chin and he's out and he's talking,

169
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:05,681
he's like,

170
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:06,301
they can't handle it.

171
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:06,800
My power,

172
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,601
I don't do us as well.

173
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:08,434
But uh,

174
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,310
but uh,

175
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,860
and Nate was saying in one of the post
fight interviews where it was like,

176
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,081
look,

177
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:16,030
I'm spoiling with Andre Ward and Joe
Schilling and like heavyweight boxers.

178
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:17,470
I'm doing rounds with heavyweight boxers.

179
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,450
There's nothing you're going to hit
him with that he hasn't seen or kind of

180
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:23,370
dealt with when he's,

181
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,060
I mean,

182
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,251
you know,

183
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:26,350
like talking like Andre
Ward and Joe Schilling,

184
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:27,210
like decent strike.

185
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:28,690
You're saying literally the best,

186
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,553
the best,

187
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,930
the best inboxing and the
best of the kickboxing.

188
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,211
Well,

189
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:37,211
Joe Schilling cuts wait to kickbox at
185 pounds and knocks dude's dead dead

190
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,520
with one punch.

191
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,660
So that guy is sparring with
Nate on a regular basis.

192
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,710
Andre Ward,

193
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,790
who is one of the best fucking
boxers on the planet earth.

194
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,760
One of the slickest said that Nate gives
as good as it gets when they spell.

195
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,040
Yeah.

196
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,440
Yeah,

197
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,610
that's crazy.

198
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,570
And I think Joe Schilling,

199
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:56,140
I might be getting it,

200
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,600
but I think Joe Schilling said he's
never heard either one of them and a

201
00:04:58,601 --> 00:04:59,261
sparring session.

202
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:01,660
I think he said that on
a fighter and the kid,

203
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,770
I believe it man.

204
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,760
Tough fucking dudes,

205
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,510
man.

206
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,350
Tough fucking dudes.

207
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,450
But what's fascinating to me is that he
wanted to jump right back in there and

208
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,670
do it again and that Nate wanted to,

209
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:15,250
or that I'm Connor wanted to
just run it back and I was like,

210
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:16,084
wow,

211
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,050
that's interesting.

212
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,820
It seems weird that he gets to do that.

213
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,590
Not so much that he wants to,

214
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,360
but it just seems weird
that they were like,

215
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:22,570
uh,

216
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,280
like even when Dana White was
talking about in his like,

217
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:24,701
look man,

218
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,680
we tried to convince them
to go down to one 45.

219
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,131
And he was like,

220
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:27,790
Nate's the,

221
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,031
I was like,

222
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:28,151
wait,

223
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,230
he's the matchmaker now.

224
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:30,041
He just gets to go.

225
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,660
Wouldn't you let them if you want,

226
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:32,800
if you want to make a ton of money,

227
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,101
right?

228
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:33,311
Man,

229
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,220
I believe in the market and that guy's,

230
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,550
that guy's what people want to see.

231
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,810
He can do what he can do,

232
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:38,710
whatever he wants to do.

233
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,330
But Nate's going to get
a big pay day off it.

234
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,780
But it's not just that the
emperor has been stripped down.

235
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,231
Okay.

236
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:45,550
So now he's exposed.

237
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,780
So now someone's beating him.

238
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,980
So here's the thing,

239
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,540
what do you do now?

240
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,830
You want to make money.

241
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,161
Okay.

242
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:52,040
Cause if you want to make money,

243
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,630
you make the biggest fight you can
right now while he's been exposed.

244
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:58,250
And the biggest fight for
sure is when I say expose,

245
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,330
I don't mean he's not talented.

246
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,440
I mean exposed,

247
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,720
meaning he's a human and he can lose.

248
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,880
And that happens with
every fighter they lose.

249
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:05,541
And once they lose,

250
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,170
people go,

251
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,280
oh,

252
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,540
you can be beat.

253
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,171
You know,

254
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:10,610
we saw it with Anderson Silva,

255
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,970
you saw with Mike Tyson and when after
Mike Tyson fought buster Douglas,

256
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:14,900
who was a different world,

257
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,411
there were,

258
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,010
everybody was like,

259
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,720
oh he's human.

260
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,060
So I say exposed not
in a disrespectful way,

261
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,710
but got exposed.

262
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,221
He lost,

263
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:22,781
he got choked out.

264
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:25,220
I got beaten up on the ground
and then he got choked out quick.

265
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,430
So this is not an invulnerable,

266
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,260
perfect fighter who's
unbelievably durable,

267
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:30,830
right?

268
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,810
Who can take punishment like no man.

269
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,550
There's a lot of those guys in the UFC,

270
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,310
there's champions like that in the
UFC that are like Robbie Lawler.

271
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,780
Unbelievably durable.

272
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,040
You can't put them away.

273
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,440
It's fucking hard to put that guy away.

274
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,610
We're not talking about that.

275
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,260
We're talking about a guy got dinged up,

276
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,310
shot for a Shitty,

277
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:47,410
wide open takedown,

278
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,750
got taken down and got demolished on
the ground and got choked unconscious

279
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,920
quickly afterwards.

280
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,023
So,

281
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,391
all right.

282
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:54,224
What do you do?

283
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,750
Could that happen with dos Anjos fuck yet.

284
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,640
Could Dosantos could do that too?

285
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,421
It's possible.

286
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,530
I mean condom might knock 'em out.

287
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,071
You never know.

288
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:02,300
Kind of does have that punch,

289
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,830
but you got to put him in against Nate
again cause that's the big money rematch.

290
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,723
And if,

291
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,740
if this guy turns out to be a guy who's
going to win some and lose some and the

292
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:13,640
beginning of his career,

293
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,880
this unbeatable wild
Celtic warrior character.

294
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,350
Oh that's all gone.

295
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,101
But he's champ.

296
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:21,200
He's still got a belt at one 45 yeah.

297
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,570
So it's almost kind of a,

298
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,530
a weird position for now.

299
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,070
But I mean,

300
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,000
here's my question.

301
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,133
When I say for now,

302
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,760
can you really keep banking that weight?

303
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,660
That's what I'm saying.

304
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,400
Well I've wondered about that too.

305
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:32,990
I've heard some people have
argued with me saying like,

306
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:33,141
no,

307
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:34,100
he can make the weight.

308
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,610
Cause he was,

309
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,101
he was what it was.

310
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:37,020
He won 69 against Nate.

311
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,000
So they're saying he basically,

312
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,160
that's what he starts at and he
can just cut down from there.

313
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,353
That's a lot.

314
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,710
But look what he looked like at the,

315
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:43,311
at the way in.

316
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:44,210
So maybe you can,

317
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,140
I mean he kinda,

318
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,700
he definitely can do it.

319
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,020
It's physically possible.

320
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,440
I was so looking forward to
the press conference though,

321
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,700
just because I can't,

322
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,040
you know,

323
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,720
you've got this guy in Connor who
is like the ultimate shit talker.

324
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,070
And then you've got Nate,

325
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,520
who,

326
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:58,791
I mean,

327
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,271
the first,

328
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,490
the dynamic at the first
press conference was amazing.

329
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,593
It was amazing.

330
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,290
And at that moment when he was just like
kind of talking circles around Nate and

331
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,370
they just broke and he goes,

332
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,240
how about this?

333
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,021
Fuck you.

334
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:09,890
Fuck your belt.

335
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,120
Fuck this press conference.

336
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:12,470
Like they just went to gangster on them.

337
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,710
But now like how can
con I was so interested,

338
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,780
like how can he show up and talk shit
like that when Nate's got the perfect

339
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:23,510
rebuttal that anything
he has to say 10 days,

340
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,920
just saying all kinds of crazy stuff.

341
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,750
Like the first eight minutes were easy.

342
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,613
Well,

343
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,760
yeah,

344
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,250
but here's the difference
between the first day,

345
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,840
the last three minutes,

346
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,490
the last three were a lot worse.

347
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:34,730
Yeah,

348
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,750
they were awful.

349
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,160
Like you got fucked up,

350
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:37,531
man.

351
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:38,780
Do you got to just accept that?

352
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,080
But that's part of his thing is that he
has to like look at things in the most

353
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:46,160
positive light possible.

354
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,090
And Man,

355
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:47,924
I dunno.

356
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,380
Um,

357
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,130
I think stylistically it's a troublesome
fight for him because Nate is a very

358
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:56,820
clever boxer and his ground game is a
world from where Connor is right now.

359
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,400
And I've seen Nate role with guys.

360
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,750
He's a fucking legit,

361
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,040
very high level Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
black belt under a very respected camp.

362
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,720
His cardio is outstanding.

363
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,070
His boxing's nasty.

364
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:09,330
So where's Connor's shining?

365
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,470
The only way I think,

366
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:10,681
I mean,

367
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:11,311
I guess there's like,

368
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:11,800
you know,

369
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:11,981
it's,

370
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:14,940
it's really hard to like fight
a Diaz brother and beat them.

371
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,470
You're usually when people beat them,

372
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:17,291
it's kind of like their,

373
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,870
they really stick to a strategy.

374
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:22,860
You've got to kind of take them down and
avoid submissions or like leg kick and

375
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,490
circle on Joe's.

376
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,950
Beat him up in that way.

377
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,790
But you know what,

378
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,350
there's also different show up.

379
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:28,860
Well,

380
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,461
there's also,

381
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:29,761
you know,

382
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:30,720
different camps.

383
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,231
You know,

384
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:32,040
you're coming in,

385
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,230
who knows what kind of fucking
injuries you're dealing with.

386
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:34,450
You know,

387
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:34,710
you've,

388
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,710
you see a guy like Nate come in and look
really kind of lackadaisical against

389
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,490
Hofeld dos Anjos.

390
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,510
Then you see him come back and look
shredded against Michael Johnson and looks

391
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:46,201
sensational.

392
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:46,521
So you go,

393
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:47,160
okay,

394
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,320
that's what he's capable
of when he's on and focus,

395
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,460
you gotta be ready for that guy.

396
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:50,941
And I think that,

397
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:51,061
yeah,

398
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:52,070
that's the best he's ever looked at.

399
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,100
You got Michael Johnson fight.

400
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,280
You can't think that the guy who
lost dos Anjos is showing up.

401
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,930
You've got to think of
the guy that came out,

402
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,120
swarmed cowboy in the
first round is common.

403
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,060
Like that guy's a clever fucking boxer.

404
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,740
So where does Connor shine?

405
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,640
Knock out power.

406
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,510
That's where he shines.

407
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,550
Like Connor can dead dudes.

408
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,643
Yeah.

409
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:10,860
Yeah.

410
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,693
They're tough to hit.

411
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,030
They have great head movement
and Green Chins and they there,

412
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,150
they roll with punches.

413
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,271
Well,

414
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:16,860
the only guy to ever stopped Nate was,

415
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:17,250
um,

416
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,480
Josh Thompson and Josh did.

417
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:19,800
It was a brutal head kick.

418
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,510
And Josh Thompson to this day,

419
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,760
I say it's one of the
most underrated guys.

420
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,870
He just,

421
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,200
he,

422
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,510
it,

423
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,240
the stars did not align for him,

424
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:28,890
but he could have easily
been a UFC champion.

425
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:30,480
He was champion a Strikeforce.

426
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:30,900
Yeah.

427
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,420
And with Gilbert and him and
Gilbert went back and forth,

428
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,350
you know,

429
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,790
Josh Thompson's worldclass fighters.

430
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,740
So when Josh Thompson head kicked him,

431
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,101
you know,

432
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:40,950
it's like Josh to do that to anybody in
that division and then it catches you.

433
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,821
You know,

434
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:42,480
you're fucked.

435
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,550
He sees an older now and he's just know,

436
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,910
I think he's a guy that like,

437
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,371
like I said,

438
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:49,040
the stars didn't like
perfectly aligned for,

439
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,480
but like skill wise and technique wise,

440
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,880
he's a fucking world class fighter.

441
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,610
So when he knocked out Nate Diaz,

442
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,650
it's not necessarily an
indication that Nate Diaz is done,

443
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,850
but he's just,

444
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,270
you know,

445
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,590
that's how good Josh Thompson is.

446
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,040
Yeah.

447
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,873
And at the time,

448
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,541
and then,

449
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,830
so Nate rebounds from that.

450
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,400
And I think people you look at like
the losses is like the dos Anjos fight.

451
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,750
And you look at that,

452
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:10,980
the Josh Thomson fight,

453
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,190
and you go,

454
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,351
well,

455
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:13,170
how good is he?

456
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:13,381
You know,

457
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,250
I can beat that guy.

458
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,470
But then you look at the
Michael Johnson finding go,

459
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:18,900
Woo that that guy is fucking dangerous.

460
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,801
Jim Miller.

461
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:20,840
Serone exactly.

462
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,040
Lot of these fights where
was just unbelievable.

463
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,060
Uh,

464
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,721
and I think,

465
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:25,554
uh,

466
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,250
it's,

467
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,450
it's one of those things were styles,

468
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:28,230
make fights and,

469
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,441
you know,

470
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:30,660
kind of really gotten people's
heads by talking shit.

471
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:31,500
And I felt like going in,

472
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:31,711
I was like,

473
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,120
I don't think you're going
to get in Nate's head.

474
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,990
My talking shit.

475
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:34,830
He's not that guy.

476
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,220
Yeah.

477
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,510
How about this micro fuck up your whole
crew gangster thing you could say,

478
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,080
by the way,

479
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,070
that's the most gangster thing.

480
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:42,330
Cause he's literally just going,

481
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,040
we'll fucking jump you dude.

482
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:44,821
Like we're not like,

483
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:46,020
we're not playing around here.

484
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,741
And all those guys,

485
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:49,050
even the guys who seem like
kind of Nice guys in his team,

486
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:50,010
like Jake shields,

487
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,420
you feel like he'll fucking jump.

488
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:54,300
You guys are vegetarian
and it'll kick your ass.

489
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,140
Yeah.
