00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,700
And then you could shoot loads in there 
at a discount.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,030
Georgia,
I'm going to give you one before you 

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,030
leave.
Take it,

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,030
throw it in the garbage.
Do whatever you like,

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,270
sir.
It is yours.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,560
Georgia is in the house from ancient 
aliens.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,920
Eddie Bravo isn't the house red bands in
the house.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,050
Pitches is ready to throw the fuck down.

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,910
This is the magic of twitter.
Ladies and gentlemen,

14
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,490
and the Internet.
Just something happened.

15
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:47,320
I don't remember where we were tweeting 
about,

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,660
but all of a sudden Georgia tweeted me 
back and I tweet him and I say,

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,830
you want to do my podcast and says fuck 
Ya.

18
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,890
And boom.
And then we meet in Vegas and we're 

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:58,890
hanging out in vegas like we'd known 
each other forever.

20
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,680
Fucking time.
Thank you dude.

21
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:05,890
There was a lot of fucking fun man.
Georgia was a cool cat.

22
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,620
And uh,
I mean,

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,380
one of my favorite shows of all time,
I love that ancient aliens.

24
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:16,381
I've got a big stack of them,
like don't necessarily agree with 

25
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:16,381
everything,
but I don't think you do either.

26
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:16,810
I think it's a lot of,
who knows,

27
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:17,740
right?
Absolutely.

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,800
So a lot of.
I mean that's what I got from you 

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:22,800
talking to you in Vegas.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:22,800
I was like,
man,

31
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,220
maybe that's crazy.
Maybe it's going to Atlanta,

32
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,770
this was a spaceship.
But if you don't know what I mean,

33
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:31,771
but you were like really open to any 
possibility which I truly admire in a 

34
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:32,710
person.
You know?

35
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:35,380
So many people are married to their 
fucking ideas,

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,750
even preposterous ideas.
Like,

37
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:38,320
you know,
the,

38
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,370
David,
I really fucking believes that there's 

39
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:43,370
reptilians that are running this planet,
you know,

40
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:48,000
like in,
and he says he's got facts and 

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,000
information.
Motherfucker.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,580
Have you seen a reptilian?
If you haven't,

43
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,770
how can you be sure?
How can you be when you hear stuff like 

44
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,080
that?
Now you're in the business of,

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,950
of this wild,
crazy.

46
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:01,951
You have a world where so many people 
look down on anything that's even 

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,820
remotely outside of the mainstream of it
gets ridiculed,

48
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,910
but when you see a guy like David,
right,

49
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,210
do you ever say,
I wonder if this motherfucker works for 

50
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,340
the government puts says so much and so 
much shit.

51
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,340
That makes sense,
and then he starts talking about 

52
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,280
reptilians and he got to go,
well that's classic disinformation.

53
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,470
That's like the move that's like,
you know,

54
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,770
if you want to a piss in the well we 
could do is just throw a bunch of shit 

55
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,631
in there that really makes sense.
Like the CIA killed JFK and we were in 

56
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,580
Vietnam for money and the military 
industrial complex.

57
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:38,770
It really does run things just like 
Eisenhower said.

58
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,370
Plus there's a pace on the moon.
We've been donating their telepathically

59
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,090
for years and what we do is we.
We have a place where we go,

60
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:50,091
well,
we teleport people and you have to be 

61
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:50,091
naked and that's why women aren't 
allowed to be on the base.

62
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:51,940
I know.
What the fuck are you talking about,

63
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:53,430
man?
And Bright,

64
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:55,330
thrilling,
all that wacky shit in there.

65
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,380
You're kind of piss on all the stuff 
that is interesting because you know,

66
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,460
you could say,
well,

67
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:05,461
wait a minute,
this guy said that the CIA killed 

68
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:08,791
Kennedy,
but then he also talked about the Wacky 

69
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:08,791
Shit on the moon,
right?

70
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:08,791
Yeah,
no,

71
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,860
absolutely.
I mean,

72
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,880
to me it's very resistant when you go 
with your gut feeling because our people

73
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,690
out there really at the same time,
some of this book that you would say 

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,330
also carry some math so you know,
that's a problem.

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,560
Know at the end of the day you just have
to let it go and be like,

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,770
that's what those people are not gonna 
know anything.

77
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,890
Whenever you have a choice because in 
the end we all make a choice what we 

78
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,900
believe in,
what we subscribe to and you know,

79
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,890
some of that stuff is crazy.
Guess what I mean?

80
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,590
If you look at the science today,
science book,

81
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,410
you know there are all these different 
theories and ideas and it's pretty much 

82
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,170
cutting edge on the cutting edge of 
knowledge.

83
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,130
But if you look in a textbook from 200 
years ago,

84
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,370
which was published by the university,
that was considered cutting edge of 

85
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,500
knowledge at the time.

86
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,760
Now you're looking at that textbook 
today,

87
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,160
200 years later and 99 percent of 
acknowledging obsolete.

88
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,440
Is that true?
Like what has been disproven?

89
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:28,441
Like what field has been completely 
reworked over the last 200 years to 

90
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:32,440
their stuff as stuff gets updated and 
how much of it is absolutely.

91
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,870
It all comes down to an edison were 
certain procedures that time considered 

92
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:45,571
to be perfect like radiation treatment 
that were actually run from the station 

93
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,160
on the monitor comes down said about 
David.

94
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:09,280
I have to ask John.
I can totally make.

95
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,050
He was a shell.
It was on youtube,

96
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,060
on a Michelle,
and now they're friends and they're 

97
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,171
going to be gone each other to hang out 
with Alex at one weekend in Vegas 

98
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:20,230
because you're a big Alex Jones Fan.
Listen brother,

99
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,110
I love Alex too.
I love Alex to.

100
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,740
Come on.
Let's hang out with the dude and then 

101
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:27,740
you get a better sense of what else 
counts.

102
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,180
Stones is Alex Jones,
24 slash seven,

103
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,750
whether it's a fucking conspiracy to 
keep him from getting a cigarette.

104
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,440
She tried to keep it from that.
Beer was this woman who works at the 

105
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,560
bar.
He sees me,

106
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:41,950
he avoids me,
avoids contact management.

107
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:44,380
Keep me from having a parent who's about
the tickets.

108
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,240
Remember the tick everything.
Anything.

109
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,940
I was worried that we weren't really 
going to get in the UFC tickets.

110
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,200
My brother,
you're good.

111
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,430
You're my friend.
We're cool.

112
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,040
Keith,
he's a great guy.

113
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,600
He's a great guy,
but he's crazy,

114
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,700
you know,
and you to be crazy to dig for the truth

115
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,930
that much.
And I look,

116
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:00,710
I say,
but Alex,

117
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,630
he's right about a lot.
Shit,

118
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,690
I don't know what the percentage is.
I always throw out a number like he's 

119
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,380
right about 70 percent,
but the 30 percent flexing that he just,

120
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,040
you know,
kind of fills in the blanks.

121
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,150
There's a lot of filling in the blanks,
but the 70 percent that he's,

122
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,930
or whatever number it is that he is 
right.

123
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,550
It's worth it.
It's shocking.

124
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,220
And he's a perfect example of what you 
were talking about before,

125
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,100
like where you have to Kinda like use 
her own filter.

126
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:24,950
There's a lot of stuff that he says that
has an incredible amount of merit.

127
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:30,010
It's absolutely correct.
And this stuff that says you're just 

128
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,440
going,
what the fuck are you talking about?

129
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,750
He gets crazy.
He doesn't go reptilian crazy,

130
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:36,220
but he gets deep in new world order.
He gets a like,

131
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,500
like eugenics crazy.
He gets like he's sure they have a 

132
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
population decreased plan where they're 
going to kill off.

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Most people except for 500,000
elites were going to be able to live 

134
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:47,680
forever.
And like,

135
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,630
man,
you got to have some fucking rock solid 

136
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:52,670
evidence to throw that one around.

137
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,620
You can't just toss that out like a 
beach ball that the elites are gonna.

138
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,880
Kill out fucking have a population 
except $500,000.

139
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,810
Maybe be someone's thought that up.
I'm not saying it's outside of the realm

140
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:07,811
of possibility.
Your business though is filled with 

141
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:07,940
that.
They mean,

142
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:12,941
look,
there are hundreds of billions of stars 

143
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:15,881
in this galaxy and we have already 
spotted so many of them over the last 

144
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,600
couple of decades or a couple of years 
rather,

145
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,200
that are in the goldilocks zone where 
they know kid possibly inhabit life.

146
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,750
They sprouted visit.
I don't know what the number are,

147
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:28,751
orbiting increases all the time.
They're constantly finding planets that 

148
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:28,751
could possibly support.
Right.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,680
And planets that are older than ours by 
a billion years plus or.

150
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:34,420
Absolutely.
In.

151
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,200
The fascinating thing is that,
you know,

152
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,680
when the sixties and seventies,
when Erich von Daniken first wrote,

153
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:41,630
chariots of the Gods,
you know,

154
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,050
the general consensus in the sixties and
seventies was that this discussion was 

155
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,040
even more taboo than it is today 
obviously.

156
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,960
But back then,
you know,

157
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:51,920
it was like,
you know,

158
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,250
maybe we were alone in the universe and 
there was only a handful like Frank 

159
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,570
Drake and the Carl Sagan who proposed 
the idea or dabbled with the idea that,

160
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:06,641
you know,
we might not be the only ones in the 

161
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:06,641
mainstream.
Legitimate.

162
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:07,820
Exactly.
I'm a community now today.

163
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,240
You,
you'd be hard pressed to find any 

164
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,451
scientist or any astronomer or 
astrophysicist that will tell you that 

165
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:20,861
they think we're alone in the universe.
So we've definitely switched where it's 

166
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,140
almost a given now that,
uh,

167
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,830
everyone thinks that,
you know,

168
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,170
they're intelligent life exists in the 
universe.

169
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,530
However,
the big taboo topic that we have today 

170
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,371
that still remains is okay,
they'll say there is life in the 

171
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:37,520
universe,
in the galaxy,

172
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,760
but there is no way that that 
intelligent life could have ever been 

173
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,010
here or visited birth in the remote past
or even present day.

174
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,580
And that to me is a fallacy in logic 
because granted the distances between 

175
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:55,980
the stars are indeed huge too mind 
boggling.

176
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,400
But just because we can't get from point
a to point b doesn't mean another 

177
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:06,831
society that like you mentioned where 
you sit or inferred that there are 

178
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:10,700
bullying years older than us on third 
world at least as a billion years old.

179
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,010
Well,
I mean we are a very,

180
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:18,000
very young culture by any means of the 
imagination.

181
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:21,810
So someone that's only 100,000
years older,

182
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,070
I mean they have technologies or other 
type of.

183
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,520
Something where they combine biology 
with technology and things like that 

184
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,460
that we couldn't even dream up right 
now.

185
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,770
Our imagination is the only thing that 
limits us from seeing what they could 

186
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,241
possibly have given them a thousand 
years in advance of us in a million 

187
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,770
years or even a few hundred years.
Man,

188
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:48,430
look what Nikola Tesla was doing in the 
early 20th century and,

189
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,000
and,
and look at what's going on today.

190
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:56,001
I mean,
that's a gigantic monumental leap and 

191
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:56,430
just a little over 100 years.
That's amazing.

192
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:56,880
Well,
I mean,

193
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:01,881
just imagine showing your great grandpa 
one of our phones today.

194
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,210
Yeah.
I mean to,

195
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,330
to him and star Trek couldn't fuck with 
that.

196
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:07,080
Right,
exactly.

197
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,110
They thought you were going to be able 
to beam people onto a planet,

198
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,980
but they still had walkie talkies 
cookout.

199
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,760
You know,
he fucking,

200
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,970
he didn't think.
Couldn't wrap

201
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:21,010
their head around the idea that you 
would have real time communication on 

202
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,130
that states.
I convene people there,

203
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:24,420
but you can't have,
you know,

204
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,380
you can just talk into it.
The voice thing.

205
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,660
Depressed the voice thing.
Go Eddie Bravo,

206
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,970
bravo comes wikipedia page videos.
That's fucking amazing and it's even 

207
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,140
with three,
14 years fast as fuck,

208
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:46,190
man,
any alien species that's a thousand 

209
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,050
years from last night,
we're going to know what they can do is 

210
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,450
absolutely silly.
We already understand principles of 

211
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,721
folding space time and meeting those two
points and having a gateway to something

212
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,790
they know that the possibility that's 
existing in the unit,

213
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,950
completely theoretical,
but so many things were theoretical just

214
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:08,951
a couple of hundred years ago and look 
what they're doing right now with with 

215
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:11,720
this higgs Boson collider in that the 
move on plasma,

216
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,880
but part of freedom,
one sugar camp is 40 or $440.

217
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:19,490
Billion tons I think.
Which one?

218
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,460
Either one fucking great sugar cube,
you know,

219
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,050
and the fact that they're gonna come up,

220
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,680
they're,
they're,

221
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,190
they're hinting that they're really 
close to discovering the God particle.

222
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,210
This is Boston us today in 2011 
something a thousand years from now.

223
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:36,070
My thought is always though that why 
would we even see it?

224
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,620
They could come as clouds.
You don't think they're gonna be able to

225
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:41,290
disguise themselves as a fucking tree or
just not.

226
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,740
Not Be visible at a around us right now 
and that is the same allegory and 

227
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,860
sometimes uses if you have some patio 
lighting out on your patio and you have 

228
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:56,920
a cat and that cat loves to go outside 
in the patio every night and you look up

229
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:58,930
to the sky or look up to the patio 
lights,

230
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,330
sees the lights and the cat might think,
yeah,

231
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:03,100
this is very pretty.
It's beautiful,

232
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,690
but that cat has no concept of what goes
into those patio lights,

233
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:10,480
that there's electricity,
plastic wiring,

234
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,770
all these different things.

235
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,410
But so,
which means that,

236
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,350
that is exactly the concept of exit 
terrestrials as well,

237
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,860
that they can conceivably show up as 
some type of shape shifters or something

238
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:29,250
and not just into people but into 
objects or something because they would 

239
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,400
use exactly the same what we use today.
And that's technology,

240
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,690
but there's something involved where,
you know,

241
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,510
just because we can't figure it out 
doesn't mean it does not exist.

242
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,460
I always say I always bring up what I 
call the art theory when it comes to,

243
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:46,870
uh,
to aliens.

244
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,700
And my theory is that the idea is that 
if you couldn't smell,

245
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,760
if you didn't have a sense of smell,
you would have no idea that farts 

246
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,420
existed.
You had no idea that you were just 

247
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:00,420
sitting in someone's asked gas,
right?

248
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,180
You would have no,
no clue,

249
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,420
but because you have a sense of smell,
this invisible thing all of a sudden 

250
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:06,420
becomes a reality.

251
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,430
How do we not know there are a million 
different senses,

252
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,490
a million different things that are 
around us all the time that we just 

253
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,521
can't tune into an all some alien has to
do is tune into something that's outside

254
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:22,681
of our spectrum to it,
into something that's not within our 

255
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:26,041
natural ability to perceive.
I mean our natural ability perceive as 

256
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,580
very similar to the people that live 
10,000

257
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,410
years ago and we're throwing fucking 
pointed sticks it,

258
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:31,810
moving animals.
This is a very,

259
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,560
very little difference between us 
genetically now and then.

260
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,800
So how do we not know that the systems 
that we have in place are all in place 

261
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,460
for the natural world,
all in place for you.

262
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,280
You hear animals,
you know you,

263
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,800
you see moving things you know and you 
smelled food.

264
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,070
You know these are all in place to keep 
us alive and keep us successful.

265
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:56,310
We could very well be developing new 
senses because of Wifi and because of 

266
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,010
all these cellular signals and the way 
human beings.

267
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,530
How sick are you right now,
buddy?

268
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,150
You want to go home or you that sick?
They want to go home.

269
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,650
I don't want you to get everybody else 
cold.

270
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,530
Perfect example.
It's fucking some shit flying through 

271
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,590
the air in this room right now.
That's this guy's sick and he's got some

272
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:19,591
germs inside of his body.
There's some shit that you can't see 

273
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:20,350
unless you get a microscope and they're 
little invading animals.

274
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:21,730
They're trying to take over and kill 
him.

275
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,510
So his army right now is at war.
There's so much shit out there.

276
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,510
There's so much shit out there that we 
can't wrap our heads around because it's

277
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:30,370
happening right here at this table right
now.

278
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,410
There's aliens watching us in the 
fridge.

279
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,000
You get into your field and how did you 
get on ancient aliens?

280
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,040
Well,
for that,

281
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:44,041
I really have to thank my,
my grandma because growing up I,

282
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:50,351
I traveled around the world with my,
with my parents and they made sure that 

283
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:55,351
we would go to those different museums 
and archeological sites and things like 

284
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:56,000
that.
Then,

285
00:14:56,001 --> 00:15:01,001
you know,
have like guided tours by the resident 

286
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:01,490
archeologists or the resident curator 
and stuff like that.

287
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,180
Um,
but then whenever I would come back 

288
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,180
home,
my grandma would say,

289
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,651
all right,
so you've just been taught about the 

290
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:13,340
contemporary contemporary ideas of 
particular cultures,

291
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,700
but let me show you that other ideas and
theories exist as well.

292
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,840
So she would tell me about that.
Lantus,

293
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:22,430
she would tell me about,
you know,

294
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:27,431
the ancient astronauts theory and 
chariots of the gods and all those 

295
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:28,850
different viewpoints that have been 
proposed by others.

296
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:34,060
So for me,
these types of topics have been.

297
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,170
I've been exposed to those fairly,
at a fairly young age.

298
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,420
I mean this was all dinner table 
conversation.

299
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,650
Um,
especially,

300
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,830
you know,
when my parents or my grandparents would

301
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:48,110
visit a.
But at the same time,

302
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,170
my mom,
she always used to say that whenever we 

303
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,740
would have to use this discussion,
she would say,

304
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,520
you know,
I really think that all of this that we 

305
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,040
have today,
it's been here before.

306
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,590
And I never knew what she meant.
And of course,

307
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:04,580
you know,
I was five,

308
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,840
six,
seven years old,

309
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,110
but today I knew exactly.
And I finally understand what she meant 

310
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,110
that,
you know,

311
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,260
this is just a repetition of history.
How high was she when she started this?

312
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,150
Hey,
I was,

313
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:21,340
I was too young.
So I'm sure they're talking about 

314
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:21,970
civilization.
I don't think so.

315
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,820
Not My mom.

316
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,280
No,
she is,

317
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,920
she's lovely.
And all of them that right now.

318
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,600
And um,
you know,

319
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,620
so,
so the,

320
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,720
the question,
you know,

321
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,390
so today especially,
you know,

322
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,950
now that my parents were like,
you know,

323
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,330
for,
for a long time,

324
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:37,300
they with that guy,
you're wasting your time with this,

325
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,220
Yada Yada.
And uh,

326
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,130
now all I have to say is that,
you know,

327
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,090
I am here because of my parents and my 
grandparents.

328
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:45,040
And so it's,
it's,

329
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,090
it was their fault that all this 
happened.

330
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,710
What year did chariots of the gods came 
out?

331
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:50,720
It came out like in the sixties.
Yeah,

332
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:55,721
it was first published in German under 
the title memories of the future in 1968

333
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,590
and then it was a runaway success and 
the first English edition came out in 

334
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,870
1970 and within a,
you know,

335
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,990
eight months or so,
6 million copies have been sold.

336
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:13,991
I mean it was an absolute phenomenon 
that they called the keitus and he was a

337
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:20,861
huge success worldwide and here we are 
in 2011 in chariots of the Gods is still

338
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:23,460
read Eric Fund.

339
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,750
Danny can just turned 77 years old by 
the way.

340
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,020
He says hello to the entire audience.
He's very happy and excited that I'm 

341
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,580
under program.
So he says yes,

342
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:36,380
absolutely listening.
So we're trying.

343
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,110
We're trying to get him on the program 
to bring them in.

344
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:41,110
We'll do it.
Remote sensing.

345
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,580
Where does he live?
He lives in Switzerland.

346
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,320
I'll fucking fly out to switch.
All right,

347
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,110
well we'll definitely set something up.
I love it when you first met him.

348
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,740
It's that kind of crazy.
Really.

349
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,870
I would say it was weird the first time 
we actually hung out and had a 

350
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,720
conversation and stuff because I had,
you know,

351
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,870
I had gone to some of his lectures when 
I was in my early teens.

352
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,080
So you know,
and you know,

353
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,760
it's different than someone named 
forever.

354
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,690
Yeah.
No,

355
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:10,170
I mean,
look,

356
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,780
I started the magazine that are 
published.

357
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,780
You published legendary 1998.
That's when we started in 1998 and in 

358
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,750
legendary times is basically all about 
ancient civilizations.

359
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Yes.
And it's specifically geared towards 

360
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,320
ancient civilizations in respect to the 
ancient astronaut theory suggesting or 

361
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,870
exploring the idea whether or not extra 
terrestrials flesh and blood exits.

362
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:38,460
Terrestrials visited earth in the remote
past.

363
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:41,100
And by that I don't mean you know,
a hundred years ago,

364
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:43,170
but we're talking five,
six,

365
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:44,430
seven,
8,000

366
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:48,420
years ago from today.
When you look at it,

367
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:53,421
when you look at the Sumerian texts and 
you look at funding Akins work and what 

368
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:56,610
is your gut impression?
Would you an thank you if got not making

369
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:58,320
a conclusion.
Which way do you lean?

370
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:03,321
Do you mean 50 percent that they were.
They were here 50 percent than maybe 

371
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:03,321
something else happened.
Like what?

372
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:06,240
How do you?
More than 50 percent personally?

373
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:07,710
Yes.
One hundred percent.

374
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,880
Absolutely.
It gives you the most hope or the most a

375
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,010
reason to believe this.

376
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,570
Well,
because it's I,

377
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,260
I sometimes liken it to when you're 
completing a puzzle,

378
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:24,290
it doesn't matter how big the puzzle is,
but the more pieces you put together,

379
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:29,811
the more pieces you fit into place,
even when that puzzle is not yet 

380
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:32,370
completed.
And we've all done puzzles as kids,

381
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:37,530
it gets easier as you move along,
but you can stop somewhere three 

382
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:43,881
quarters of the way and you can look at 
that puzzle and you know exactly what 

383
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:47,340
the picture looks like even though it's 
not yet complete.

384
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:52,341
And there's a couple of pieces missing.
So that is what the ancient astronauts 

385
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:56,841
theory to me is like that there are so 
many indications from our ancient 

386
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:02,490
cultures that the conclusion,
in my opinion is inescapable.

387
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,400
And I'm not just saying this,
you know,

388
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,520
because I'm pulling this out of my ass,
but because there are stories and there 

389
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,430
are physical pieces of evidence that the
only conclusion that we can draw unless 

390
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,210
we go into the realm of the fantastical 
and the unlikely is that we have been 

391
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:26,180
visited by flesh and blood exits the 
restaurant.

392
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,540
What is the,
what is like,

393
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,910
if you were going to try to convince 
somebody,

394
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,160
what is the most compelling evidence in 
your opinion that,

395
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,940
you know,
you said there's,

396
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,220
there's evidence where you cannot draw 
any other conclusions.

397
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,400
What is the most compelling?
Well,

398
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,590
you know,
and this is where I truly enjoy and 

399
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,161
respect the work of many archaeologists 
around the world because they excavating

400
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,380
a different,
uh,

401
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,690
sites and different monuments and 
they're truly breaking their backs for 

402
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,490
some fantastic research.
However,

403
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,870
sometimes when you look at that research
or some of the ideas that they present,

404
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,580
um,
there are some faults in,

405
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:08,380
in,
in logic there because they,

406
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:13,381
for example,
suggests that we have moved a block 

407
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:15,700
that's 1,500
tons heavy,

408
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:20,701
1,500
metric tons heavy with a piece of string

409
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:24,940
and some chicken bones.
And today our cranes,

410
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,690
they tap out at 1,350
tons.

411
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,430
So if we today,
how much difference is that weight was.

412
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,340
Oh,
that's,

413
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,480
we're talking about 200 and 200 tons.
So 200 tons shy.

414
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,610
Yeah,
we can do to.

415
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,990
Right,
right,

416
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,260
exactly.
It's heavier.

417
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,200
So using that as the best proof.
Well,

418
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,310
I mean there's multiple.
I mean that,

419
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:51,340
that one block for example,
is it the city in Lebanon called bow 

420
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:51,340
back?
I've seen,

421
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,330
we've all seen that amazing stone that's
in charge of the God the movie.

422
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,280
Exactly,
yes.

423
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:58,060
Heliopolis,

424
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,830
you've seen it already right beyond you,
you,

425
00:22:00,831 --> 00:22:02,220
you,
you can't even wrap your head around it.

426
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,750
He was like,
this is not,

427
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,000
you can't move this,
move this.

428
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:11,001
So you have photos of that.
Was it maybe just something that we're 

429
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:11,001
not thinking of like,
like it was,

430
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:15,760
you know,
underwater at one point it made it 

431
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,220
easier to move rocks or anything like 
that or this,

432
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,450
it doesn't make it easier to move 
something to epic.

433
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,350
What would the,
the,

434
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,070
the possibilities are?
There's two in my opinion,

435
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,840
there's his idea that we've been visited
by ancient aliens and then there's the,

436
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,970
the idea that civilization has been 
restarted several times and that is that

437
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,090
there's some sort of a cataclysmic event
that's killed almost everybody except 

438
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,320
for a small amount of stragglers and 
they regrouped and rebuilt and rethought

439
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:42,060
things out.
And that's one of the reasons why things

440
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:46,500
come so quickly and technology is moving
so fast and as your mom said,

441
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:47,850
or whose grandmother,
whoever it was,

442
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,490
that we are relearning.
We've done this before.

443
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:56,210
And,
and it can also be a combination of 

444
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:56,210
both.
You see that?

445
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,180
That's the thing that uh,
there are.

446
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,560
Can I see that picture?
Of course.

447
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,930
This is the one.
This is the,

448
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,490
this is Baalbek.
Yes.

449
00:23:03,491 --> 00:23:08,491
There's the bow back.
It's called the stone of the pregnant 

450
00:23:08,491 --> 00:23:12,181
woman and it's one of the biggest 
monoliths that has ever been seen on 

451
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,090
planet earth.
And uh,

452
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,830
you know,
to me right there,

453
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,830
we could not move this with our modern 
day cranes.

454
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,790
And so,
you know,

455
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,700
something happened in all of the ancient
sites because you know,

456
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,230
we know there's absolutely no question 
in my mind that our ancestors,

457
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,440
I mean they were extremely smart.
They were ingenious and obviously did 

458
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,560
they know how to cut stones and how to 
transport them and things like that.

459
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,720
However,
there,

460
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,740
and I'm not really interested in moving 
around stones that are cut from 

461
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,170
limestone or sandstone and things like 
this.

462
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,560
But what I'm interested in is stuff like
this where it was cut out of granted or 

463
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,150
out of diorite.
We're still today.

464
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,420
We use diamond tip saws in order to cut 
any of these blocks that we cut today 

465
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,980
and allegedly our ancestors that this 
with copper tools.

466
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:12,010
And I'm sorry,
somewhere the logic just fails because 

467
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,591
there's logic certainly fails that,
that technology that we attributed to 

468
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:17,990
those people because we have to put them
in the bronze age.

469
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:20,330
And the copper age,
we can't put them in the age of steel,

470
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,780
but to me the logic is much more likely 
that they we were wrong about the age of

471
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:28,970
bronze and steel and that people had to 
figure it out.

472
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,190
Diverse hip tools like went there,
didn't they find markings inside the 

473
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,250
sarcophagus and the king's chamber of 
the Great Pyramid of Giza?

474
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:42,370
Yes.
That they believe were attributed only 

475
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:42,370
to diamond.
Head of drill.

476
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,540
Absolutely.
And in Egypt we have a very fascinating 

477
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,151
site called Abi Dose and in Abi Dose you
have a sorry,

478
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,100
in Aba Zeer,
not in Dose Abbott doses where they have

479
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:57,101
to do those weird hieroglyphics,
but in Ab Azir you have a what's known 

480
00:24:57,101 --> 00:25:01,931
as a signatures of core drills,
and a core drill is basically if you 

481
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:08,291
imagine a steel tube tip with diamonds 
that drills itself into the ground or 

482
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:11,150
into the Rock,
and then you break it free.

483
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,520
You take out that tube and inside of it 
you have like a pipe of that,

484
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,710
a cordial sample of that particular 
rock.

485
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,110
Now in Abu Azir,
we find multiple stones where we can see

486
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:28,700
a signature of these types of machining 
that took place there.

487
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,800
Now a lot of people have said,
oh,

488
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:32,990
well,
these are all modern day occurrences.

489
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,940
And uh,
it was done.

490
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,120
You know,
when the first first a modern day core 

491
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,620
drill machine was invented in 19,
early 19 twenties.

492
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:47,960
Now when you look at the book that Surf 
Flinders Petrie wrote,

493
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,780
that book was written in Nineteen Oh 
six.

494
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,610
And it already had drawings of those 
core drill holes in them,

495
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,820
which proves that these core drill holes
that we can find acquisitions are not 

496
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:06,761
modern day creations.
And that is absolutely crazy because 

497
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:12,491
Christopher done,
one of my colleagues who wrote the Giza 

498
00:26:12,491 --> 00:26:14,540
power plant,
he proved because he's a machinist,

499
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:18,950
I mean he's an engineer and he knows 
this stuff like the back of his hand.

500
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:21,320
So it's not like somebody walked along 
and said,

501
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:22,820
this is how it is.
But this guy,

502
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,900
that's what he does for a living.
He builds machines and he,

503
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:27,950
uh,
you know,

504
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,170
precision mechanisms and things like 
this.

505
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,980
So he is trained for that kind of a,
you know,

506
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:39,010
investigation and uh,
he said that there is no way that this 

507
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,400
could have been done with,
uh,

508
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,020
with copper tools.

509
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,890
I mean,
it's just.

510
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,080
And so,
you know,

511
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,950
there's some,
just wild,

512
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,720
wild pieces of evidence that we have out
there like in Puma Puma,

513
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,820
for example,
highly in the Bolivian highlands at an 

514
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,320
altitude of 12 and a half thousand feet.
There is this magnificent place called 

515
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,620
to an ACO that everyday hundreds of 
tourists arrive there and they look at 

516
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:10,641
it,
it take pictures and then they leave as 

517
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:10,641
clueless as they arrived.
And,

518
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:11,640
um,
uh,

519
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,630
about 150 200 yards away from,
from,

520
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:19,860
to knock who there's another site that's
very much lesser known,

521
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,330
called Puma Puma.
Cool.

522
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:26,650
And at Puma Puma,
everything defies logic is defied at 

523
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:32,661
Puma.
Puma will be caused the blocks of stone 

524
00:27:32,661 --> 00:27:32,661
that we have.
There are pure diorite,

525
00:27:32,661 --> 00:27:37,640
andesite and granted and uh,
they are so perfect that we today would 

526
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:42,870
have a hard time recreating some of 
these blocks.

527
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,630
And I actually spoke to a real life 
stonemasons.

528
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:52,730
His name is Roger Hopkins.
And he looked at some of these pictures 

529
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,931
that I showed him of Puma Puma crew,
and he said that not for any amount of 

530
00:27:56,931 --> 00:28:00,801
money or for any amount of time would 
volunteer to try to replicate some of 

531
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,760
these rocks as somebody blocks.
And if a real life stone mason says 

532
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,610
this,
I mean God bless the,

533
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,970
um,
the professors and the archeologists,

534
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,360
but I'd rather listen to someone who cut
stone for a living than someone you know

535
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,180
who stands before a blackboard.
But this guy who cut stone for a living,

536
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,300
what he said was that it could be done.
You said it would be really hard and he 

537
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,210
wouldn't want to do it for any amount of
money,

538
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,530
but that it couldn't be done.
Yes.

539
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:31,020
But I wouldn't lead with,
with modern day.

540
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:32,650
Yes.
And not with what?

541
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:36,090
So with chicken bones,
if we know that if we know that it could

542
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:41,091
be done with modern technology,
wouldn't it be more likely that modern 

543
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:47,541
technology is sort of a recreation of 
what people did learn in the past and 

544
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:50,280
that they probably were wiped out by 
some sort of a cataclysmic disaster.

545
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:55,490
That to me,
seems way more likely than aliens came 

546
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:55,490
and moved rocks.
No,

547
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,120
you're saying if like if Pete,
if it'd be really,

548
00:28:57,121 --> 00:28:58,920
really difficult for people to do it 
today.

549
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Well,
there's a lot of stuff that will be 

550
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,160
incredibly difficult for people to do it
today.

551
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,200
I'm not necessarily suggesting 
suggesting that aliens moved to rocks.

552
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:12,470
What I'm saying is that the aliens that 
visited Earth gave the technology or 

553
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:18,470
taught the technology to humans because 
what they wanted to do is to leave 

554
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:23,760
behind messages that they were here in 
the past.

555
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,600
So all those incredible monuments that 
we have today,

556
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:32,820
like the Pyramids of Giza or Stonehenge 
or Puma Puma for example,

557
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:36,270
or new grange.
All these magnificent sights in Cusco,

558
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,920
Machu Picchu in Peru,
that all those places are messages for a

559
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:46,921
future generation to understand that 
something way different happened in our 

560
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,890
past.
That is the main reason why,

561
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:55,891
for example,
we have religions today and things like 

562
00:29:55,891 --> 00:29:55,891
this.

563
00:29:55,891 --> 00:29:59,910
So.
So you think that pretty much all 

564
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,220
science emanates from some sort of an 
alien contact?

565
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,860
Is that what you think?
Uh,

566
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,510
no because modern day,
because you know,

567
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,080
because was a trace of modernist science
so you can follow it.

568
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,220
Exactly right.
Now let's think about this.

569
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:14,250
What,
what age do you think people had 

570
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,590
technology that sort of any fucking nut 
that crashed and the,

571
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,600
you know,
the TV show lost crash on an island and 

572
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,070
you could recreate,
what was that like maybe 2000,

573
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:27,400
3000 years ago,
no more thousand dollars,

574
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,890
something like that.
So like five,

575
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:34,891
6,000
years ago they were basically living 

576
00:30:34,891 --> 00:30:34,891
like savages,
right?

577
00:30:34,891 --> 00:30:36,430
Supposedly.
Suppose serially supposedly yes.

578
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,640
If you follow,
let's give him even even even early.

579
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:40,570
I mean,
look,

580
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,550
the thing is my point,
I'm sorry,

581
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:45,450
I just,
my point was that if in 10,000

582
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,490
years time people have gone from being 
cave dwelling savages that were throwing

583
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:51,520
pointy sticks,
it,

584
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:55,690
moving animals to people with cell 
phones and the Internet and wireless and

585
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:59,530
this is all created pain arguably by 
human beings.

586
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:02,650
There's a record of all these inventions
and all these creations.

587
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,900
If this has been achieved over 10,000
years,

588
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,490
what's to say that there wasn't some 
sort of a massive disaster that happened

589
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:13,390
at the end of the last ice age or 
younger in in their 20,000

590
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:15,550
years ago,
but the date it for 15,000,

591
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:20,551
whatever the fuck it is,
and that technology died and that 

592
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:25,831
civilization died and it had to be 
reinvented by the surviving humans 

593
00:31:25,831 --> 00:31:28,870
basically from scratch and that even 
though human beings have been around for

594
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:30,040
a long,
long,

595
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:34,150
long time before that and civilization 
had evolved to an incredibly high level,

596
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,480
all that information was lost.
That to me is way more likely than 

597
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,330
aliens.
Well,

598
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,530
but see,
here's the thing.

599
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,730
This is where the difference lies that 
when let's say the Sumerian culture 

600
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,370
sprung out of virtually nothing happened
virtually overnight.

601
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:57,030
The Sumerians were very clear in stating
that they got their start in 

602
00:31:57,731 --> 00:32:02,731
civilization by what they referred to as
the under knocking and the unlock key 

603
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:05,250
translated into English means those who 
from the hurricane.

604
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,160
Yes,
exactly,

605
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,880
but isn't that true that that's only by.
That means Zechariah stitching is pretty

606
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:13,370
much the main scholar of the Sumerian 
texts that police.

607
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,390
There's a lot of other scholars that do 
not agree with it.

608
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,340
Absolutely.
But the translation,

609
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,360
even a,
a,

610
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,380
a quote unquote mainstream scientist or 
some neurologist will say that on 

611
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,610
knocking means that I mean that,
that is not,

612
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:28,720
for example,
the sicker,

613
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:33,721
right.
He did have quite a few things that he 

614
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:33,721
translated,
you know,

615
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:35,100
quote unquote himself.
Uh,

616
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,740
so that's definitely a valid point.
But there are the great majority of what

617
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:40,010
he's

618
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,010
talking about has been translated 
correctly and he has used,

619
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,620
you know,
many of the most accessible,

620
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,630
uh,
and correct translations that can be 

621
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,960
found today.
But even in the epic of Gilgamesh,

622
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:58,961
don't they refer to a long gone superior
civilization that existed before then?

623
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,190
Yes.
But that,

624
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:06,220
but that civilization always lived,
quote unquote somewhere else and 

625
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,420
integrate dark void.
Now what's the great dark avoid?

626
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:15,430
That's a beautiful Pasadena city name.
It's a poetic way of saying compton deep

627
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:22,480
space.
Compton would've been better for him.

628
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,350
Shit fucked up.
Yeah,

629
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,650
maybe.
Maybe it is,

630
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,320
but you know,
you follow me.

631
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,120
What I'm saying is that like,
you know,

632
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,520
I firmly believe that there's life out 
there.

633
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:33,950
I mean,
I think the possibility is,

634
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,660
you know,
there's the numbers,

635
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,850
you know,
and I think it's also very possible that

636
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:42,851
it's reached us,
but I think if you look at what's more 

637
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:46,091
likely,
if we absolutely know that people can 

638
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:48,950
build a immense structures,
if we absolutely know that civilization,

639
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:54,180
uh,
most likely because of all these 

640
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,190
historical,
you know,

641
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,500
depictions of natural disasters,
whether it's the epic of Gilgamesh or 

642
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,471
Noah's Ark,
or 100 different cultures that have 

643
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:05,260
stores of apocalyptic disastrous and the
volatile nature of the earth itself.

644
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,940
The fact that we know it's covered in 
craters,

645
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:12,941
the fact that we know that every plan 
and we look at the moon and just see 

646
00:34:12,941 --> 00:34:15,281
creators all over the place.
We know about the shifting of the polar 

647
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:15,281
ice caps,
who know about Pangea.

648
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:19,961
We know that there was intelligent life 
probably in some sort of a monkey forum 

649
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:19,961
when Pangea was around,
right?

650
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,540
Yes.
No,

651
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:25,541
absolutely.
But a beating for people don't know the 

652
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,290
whole entire world is one continent 
that's a fieriness drifted apart.

653
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,460
I think that,
I mean,

654
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,880
I just think that if we know for a fact 
that human beings are capable now of 

655
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,080
doing spectacular things,
and we have said already that if we 

656
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,980
existed 100 years more man,
and imagine what we would know.

657
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,850
Just imagine what has sprung out over 
the last hundred,

658
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,530
300 years.
You know,

659
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:48,290
and I think you add a few hundred years 
for that or a thousand years to that.

660
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,580
It's not unreasonable in my opinion,
to think that 10,000

661
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:55,340
years ago there was some sort of an 
event,

662
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:58,050
some sort of catastrophic.
Maybe it's $15,000,

663
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:03,060
whatever the fuck name it,
a catastrophic event that fuck this 

664
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,640
world sideways and killed almost 
everybody.

665
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,670
To me that is just way more likely than 
these people got it from some higher 

666
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:12,560
intelligence.
Both of them.

667
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:17,620
A Combo of both.
And how many different ancient 

668
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,430
civilizations tell you,
tell the people where they got their,

669
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,260
their knowledge.
It's not just the Samaritans,

670
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:26,261
they're all telling you there's an 
incredible monuments that were puzzled 

671
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:28,860
us today.
We're telling you that dudes from Earth,

672
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,550
from the heavens came down and showed 
us,

673
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:36,551
but no one's bleeding.
We're also telling you that a guy died 

674
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,010
and came back to earth three days later 
he turned water into

675
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,820
wine.
But these,

676
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,670
these are structures that actually you 
could see in their scientists.

677
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,680
Baffled by what you mean,
like structures and stuff in South 

678
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,300
America,
the Mayans.

679
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,250
Um,
all the ancient Sumerian.

680
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:50,760
Well,
yeah.

681
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:51,010
Well,
the,

682
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,990
the Mayans,
you know,

683
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,660
they did their shit is totally 
different.

684
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:58,320
I mean they believe that a fucking plume
snake created the universe.

685
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,520
No,
hold on a second now.

686
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,070
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
What?

687
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:09,350
What is behind this story?
Snake mushrooms like a motherfucker in 

688
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,980
the jungle.
Hang it out.

689
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,440
Banging hot.
My in checks chilling.

690
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,450
I mean that.
No Internet.

691
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,500
That's definitely an idea and 
possibility playing football with human 

692
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,821
heads.
But I'm trying to figure out what are 

693
00:36:25,821 --> 00:36:27,900
the realities behind the stories.
I certainly think it's a possibility.

694
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:29,550
I'm not ruling out that pause.
Oh no,

695
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:30,510
of course not.
But you know,

696
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,560
it is definitely a combination because 
the bottom line is that all these 

697
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,500
ancient cultures are very adamant and 
very specific in saying that this all 

698
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,400
happened because of a visit from beings 
from the stars.

699
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,240
The star thing is very prevalent.
If it were a previous civilization or if

700
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:52,980
it were,
let's say,

701
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,350
human beings.
Because sometimes people say,

702
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:56,670
well,
how come you don't?

703
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,800
How come you're not talking about that?
Maybe a w.

704
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,850
it's our civilization from the future 
travel into the past to help us with 

705
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,600
certain developments.
Well,

706
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:11,630
that can't be true because nowhere in 
the ancient texts do we find any 

707
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:14,310
reference where it says,
well,

708
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,590
we're just like you,
but we're from the future.

709
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,250
Maybe future bullshit artists.
That's those little gray dudes.

710
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:23,160
Are they just completely full of Shit?
They're us from the future,

711
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,530
but they fuck with us the same way we 
fuck with monkeys.

712
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,590
If you,
if you get in the cage,

713
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:33,591
I'll give you a banana and the monkey 
gets in the cage and you just steal 

714
00:37:33,591 --> 00:37:33,591
them.
Take them to the zoo,

715
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,880
given that banana.
And he was like,

716
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:34,990
what?

717
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:40,020
The crazy thing about Zachariah,
essentially when people questioned his 

718
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,371
translations are the things that he got 
right in the seventies and they were 

719
00:37:43,371 --> 00:37:45,450
finding out just today in 2000,
one,

720
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:50,451
2002,
that in the stories that he's talking 

721
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:50,451
about,
the adult hockey,

722
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:53,770
he saying in a nutshell that there's a 
hyper advanced wraith is created us as 

723
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,830
slaves to mine gold because they needed 
gold dust particles to suspend them.

724
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:01,190
An atmosphere to protect our planet.
Well,

725
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,570
we just discovered in the 2000 thing,
hey,

726
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,110
you actually do protect atmospheres by 
suspending metallic product.

727
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,320
How the hell did an archeologist know 
some astrophysics in the seventies?

728
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,160
That's an intention.
Yeah.

729
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:17,850
Well it is possible that they were 
really sophisticated seven,

730
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:22,851
8,000
years ago and they knew that we were 

731
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:23,580
eventually going to run into the same 
problems again.

732
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:28,581
I mean they,
maybe they were burning shit back then 

733
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:30,801
that was eating up the ozone layer.
Maybe they were fucking with chemicals 

734
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:30,801
back then just like we are now.
But that.

735
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,460
So that would mean that were super 
smart.

736
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,830
Yeah.
But they're telling you specifically

737
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,920
the reason why they to.
Yes.

738
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,280
Yeah.
Well,

739
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:41,090
they figured it out,
figured it out,

740
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,630
just like we figured it out now and they
figured it out then.

741
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,370
No,
but they're telling you how they figured

742
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:50,371
it out.
They're saying they're saying they got 

743
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:50,371
it from the owner.
Not Again,

744
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:51,190
this.
I don't know.

745
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:56,470
See,
I don't know enough about language to 

746
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,210
argue against or for switching,
but I know that he's a road scholar.

747
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,490
He's not the only one though.
I mean again,

748
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,580
knockier to Sumerian stories are not the
only stories that we find constraints 

749
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,710
for evidence Dogan mean they completely 
such detailed astronomical knowledge 

750
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:15,810
which was not corroborated it until the 
19,

751
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,410
early 19 sixties and there's still 
people that say,

752
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:24,411
oh,
this is a complete hoax when it really 

753
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:26,480
isn't.
I mean they knew about invisible stars 

754
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,110
that were then later truly corroborated 
by NASA and other astrophysicists.

755
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,420
I mean,
how on earth would they know something 

756
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,091
like this and the Dogan give you the 
answers that they were visited by 

757
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:43,101
somebody that descended from the sky and
then who are we to say that these people

758
00:39:44,191 --> 00:39:49,191
are lying or that they made up fantasy 
stories because that to me is the 

759
00:39:49,191 --> 00:39:49,680
insult,
right?

760
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,060
When people,

761
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,210
we'll say salt the fuck out of some old 
tribes.

762
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,900
Shit.
No,

763
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,740
no,
no snakes.

764
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,170
I'm just referring to,
you know,

765
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,880
because because people archeologist the 
bunkers are saying,

766
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:01,450
well,
you know,

767
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:06,710
you,
you guys attribute everything to alien 

768
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:06,710
intervention and uh,
you know,

769
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,560
you undermine to human,
human ingenuity.

770
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:10,250
You're suggesting that,
you know,

771
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:15,330
our ancestors were stupid and,
and nothing could be further from the 

772
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,421
truth because obviously nothing happened
in our brain development in the last 

773
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:19,600
50,000
years.

774
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:24,100
If you bring someone from 10,000
years ago to today,

775
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,330
you can teach that person how to drive a
car.

776
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:30,820
You can teach that person even to fly a 
plane,

777
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:36,210
no problem.
Because intellectually speaking they're 

778
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,660
as capable as we are today.
However,

779
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:43,140
there was one huge difference and that 
is their technological frame of 

780
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,780
reference was different or smaller than 
what we have today.

781
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:52,020
So when we have stories of flying 
shields or dragons or smoking a snakes 

782
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:57,730
and plumes and plume snakes and things 
like that,

783
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,410
then my question is,
well,

784
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:04,411
what was it exactly that our ancestors 
try to describe with their vocabulary 

785
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:09,400
because they didn't have the vocabulary 
for rocket or for,

786
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:14,690
you know,
so they had to liken a rocket to a 

787
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:14,690
blazing oven or something like this or 
you know,

788
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,010
gleaming bronze,
a monster and things like that.

789
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,950
So there in lies,
lies the big difference.

790
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:23,650
And so when archeologists and say,
well,

791
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:28,651
you know,
you're saying that I undermine human 

792
00:41:28,651 --> 00:41:29,570
ingenuity from the past.
It's like,

793
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:34,571
no,
I'm really not because I am reading to 

794
00:41:34,571 --> 00:41:37,501
you exactly that these same people said 
that they received their knowledge from 

795
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:41,210
these humanoid beings that the senate 
from the sky.

796
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,010
So you think that that's the,
uh,

797
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:48,180
the most compelling piece of evidence to
you is a human beings depictions of what

798
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:51,860
was going on,
like given us or you know.

799
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,750
No,
no,

800
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,770
that is definitely.
See that,

801
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:58,310
and that's the great thing about the 
ancient alien theory that you can,

802
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:03,370
you know,
it's such an interdisciplinary field of 

803
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:03,370
research that,
you know,

804
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:07,990
you can look at ancient Egypt and you 
can look at South America and draw 

805
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:10,230
correlations.
I mean they did.

806
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,090
They found crazy correlations between 
those two cultures,

807
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:19,091
for example,
where they found cocaine in mummies and 

808
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:21,650
things like that where cocaine was only 
available in one country.

809
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,970
And so,
so it was definitely,

810
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,210
I mean,
something definitely happened that there

811
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:31,211
was trade between continents and 
personally I suggest that trait didn't 

812
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:34,760
necessarily happen on,
on water,

813
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,870
but that they actually had,
you know,

814
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,300
aircraft because that is what the 
ancient texts are saying,

815
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,200
not only in India with the vimanas but 
also in,

816
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,470
um,
in the Hebrew and an Ethiopian cultures.

817
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:53,490
Have you have the story of King Solomon 
and his flying carpet and it's flying 

818
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,971
machine.
Didn't your show take an artifact and 

819
00:42:57,971 --> 00:42:58,400
recreated?
Explain that.

820
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,230
Tell me about what happened there.
Well,

821
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,960
where was the artifact from?
It's from South America,

822
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:07,961
from Columbia,
and it's a gold funerary objects.

823
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:13,300
It's a totem that hundreds of thousands 
and thousands of those little artifacts 

824
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:19,631
have been found and they will usually 
shaped in the form of frogs and insects 

825
00:43:20,571 --> 00:43:23,480
and fish and crocodiles and things like 
that.

826
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:28,750
However,
out of those thousands of funerary 

827
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,751
objects that have been found about eight
were found worldwide that looked like 

828
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:37,631
modern day airplanes and so these two 
engineers in one,

829
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:42,990
one doctor and one engineer in Germany,
what they did is in the early,

830
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:45,020
in the mid nineties,
1996,

831
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:50,021
they took one of those little funerary 
objects and they blew it up to ratio and

832
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,240
to size without adding an inch or 
subtracting an inch.

833
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,240
I mean they just basically blew it up to
about three to four feet long and it 

834
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,690
looks exactly like exactly.
And the.

835
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:06,530
They put a propeller inside and they had
tried multiple objects.

836
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:11,531
I mean,
they didn't just do one that they 

837
00:44:11,531 --> 00:44:11,531
thought,
well,

838
00:44:11,531 --> 00:44:12,860
this one is most likely like a looks 
most likely like a plane,

839
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,390
so let's just do this.
Well No,

840
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:16,900
they took a whole bunch of them and they
recreated them as,

841
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:21,110
as model planes.
A throw them up in the air and they were

842
00:44:21,111 --> 00:44:26,111
100 percent aerodynamically sound.
They were able to do roles and looping 

843
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,450
loops and stuff like that.
I mean,

844
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:32,070
they were 100 percent,
uh,

845
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,160
you know,
there were airplanes and even to the 

846
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:37,160
untrained eye,
uh,

847
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,560
they,
they look like planes because here's the

848
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:45,561
thing that you know,
a lot of people say about when they say 

849
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:48,720
that these are also fish or insects,
but you look at that,

850
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:54,021
that's an airplane because first of all 
it's got a delta shape and a fuselage 

851
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,600
and then you have the stabilizers in the
back and you've got an upright rudder 

852
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:04,070
and no living creature in nature does 
not exist.

853
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:10,790
Plus the wing formation is a low wing 
formation.

854
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:14,250
Where would have wings are attached to 
the bottom of the fuselage body.

855
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:19,310
Exactly.
And we have our wings are arms attached 

856
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,890
like a,
the birds and the shoulder girdle.

857
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,750
And that formation that we can find in 
the Colombian artifact does not.

858
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,900
It doesn't.
It doesn't suggest how old is that 

859
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:31,900
artifact?
One thousand 500 to 1000,

860
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,490
600 years old.
God Dang.

861
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,610
Yeah.
So totally.

862
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:40,611
My region in Columbia and Pre-colombian 
artifact and it's uh,

863
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:46,041
you know,
so those are all those little things 

864
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:48,870
that all fit together.
Some how,

865
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:54,350
and in my opinion,
they had something to do with flesh and 

866
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,100
blood aliens who visited in the remote 
past.

867
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,710
It's so weird that our history is so 
incomplete.

868
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,740
That's why we're having this debate.
The reason why we're having this debate 

869
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,580
is because we know that the history so 
sketchy when you get just a few thousand

870
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:07,800
years ago,
that's all he fucking knows,

871
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:08,100
man.

872
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:13,310
And it doesn't help when you get these 
conventional archaeologists that are so 

873
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,150
fucking set in their ways.
Man,

874
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:20,450
this Robert Schoch,
John Anthony West thing that's going on 

875
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:20,450
in Egypt,
in,

876
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:25,190
pertaining to the dating of the Sphinx.
I find their research fascinating.

877
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:30,201
What I find more fascinating is how 
these mainstream egyptologist just just 

878
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:31,140
poo poo it.
Like,

879
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:36,170
oh,
well where's the evidence for this 

880
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:36,170
culture?
Like the,

881
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,531
the argument they had was so childish.
It was so egotistical that guy was 

882
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:40,050
standing up going,
you know,

883
00:46:40,051 --> 00:46:42,510
you're talking about the Sphinx being 
predating,

884
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:43,740
you know,
9,000

885
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:48,741
BC.
Where's the evidence of this culture 

886
00:46:48,741 --> 00:46:48,741
that's willing to do?
Where's the evidence?

887
00:46:48,741 --> 00:46:52,070
Like,
what the fuck do you think is going to 

888
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:52,070
be there,
sir?

889
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:52,680
What do you think is going to be there 
after 11,000

890
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:54,230
years?
You're talking 9,000

891
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,980
BC.
How much is going to be left?

892
00:46:55,981 --> 00:47:00,981
Man,
I'll tell you what's going to be left 

893
00:47:00,981 --> 00:47:02,630
rocks and there's your evidence 
geological ropps that are so fucked up 

894
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,240
by water that it has to be thousands of 
years of rainfall,

895
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,350
you know that is unanimous.

896
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:12,350
When geologists look at the Sphinx 
enclosure and they and they show of 

897
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:16,350
photographs of the water,
the water erosion of the fishers,

898
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,680
they're 100 percent agreed that it's 
water erosion due to thousands of years 

899
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:26,040
of rain fall by the way rainfall to not 
just flooding,

900
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:30,040
not like one crazy flood know thousands 
or many years,

901
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,800
so that just shows you.
It has to be older than 9,000

902
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:37,600
bc because that was the last time there 
was flooding or there's a rain forest in

903
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:42,601
the Nile Valley know.
And the crazy thing is also that their 

904
00:47:42,601 --> 00:47:44,380
research is corroborated by other 
research as well.

905
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:49,381
When my colleague Robert Boulevard came 
out with the Orion mystery and when he 

906
00:47:49,381 --> 00:47:54,210
suggested that if you look at the great,
the three great pyramids of Giza from a 

907
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:58,300
bird's eye perspective,
you see that the three are sort of lined

908
00:47:58,301 --> 00:48:01,390
up but not completely.
They're not in a straight line.

909
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,540
At the smallest pyramid is a bit off and
he's like,

910
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:07,210
well that's really strange,
so what's going on here?

911
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:12,211
And then he determined that these three 
pyramids are in fact built to the exact 

912
00:48:12,211 --> 00:48:15,370
ratio of Orion to three stars in Orion's
belt.

913
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,900
The band heard though,
that the only way you could see the 

914
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,091
three stars from that angle,
you would have to look at everything 

915
00:48:24,091 --> 00:48:27,570
upside down from like like that.
It doesn't actually work that way,

916
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,740
but it was disproven that you can you.
You can see it that way,

917
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,660
but not from Earth,
not from.

918
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:39,690
Not from the way we look at it.
You would have to have reverse 

919
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:39,690
everything.
Is that true?

920
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:43,620
Yes.
I mean look at the general idea still 

921
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,221
holds.
Even though that the upside down theory 

922
00:48:47,221 --> 00:48:48,520
is possibly correct.
I am not sure of that,

923
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:51,580
to be honest with you.
I'm not sure what either I a video.

924
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:56,580
I think however,
what he did determine is the fact that 

925
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,910
the time,
if you were to put three floodlights on 

926
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:03,370
top of each tip of the pyramid and a 
fire it straight into the sky,

927
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,650
you know,
like at the bookstore in Las Vegas,

928
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:11,010
the big been the time when the three 
tips of those pyramids would line up 

929
00:49:12,011 --> 00:49:17,011
exactly with Orion spelled and you have 
software for this where you can rewind 

930
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:20,260
back the night sky and the computer 
these days.

931
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:24,580
Um,
it would be in 12,500,

932
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,650
12,000,
500 years ago,

933
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,920
which bore a labeled or is known 
Egyptology as the golden age when the 

934
00:49:33,911 --> 00:49:38,710
gods still walked amongst men.
And so the fact that the pyramid,

935
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,610
I mean the Sphinx also eight to 9,000
BC,

936
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,880
well that's 1200.
That's the golden age that everybody 

937
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:47,880
talks about in,
in,

938
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,500
in Egypt,
and really learned thousand BC thousands

939
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:51,100
of years earlier.

940
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,320
It has to exist because of the thousands
of years of rainfall.

941
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:55,690
So you are talking,
it'd be 10,500

942
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:57,040
BC,
maybe 11 or so.

943
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:02,041
The fact is that the,
and there are ancient texts that talk 

944
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,770
about these,
uh,

945
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,640
these,
um,

946
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,250
these previous cultures or your 
previous,

947
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:08,690
uh,
uh,

948
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:13,240
periods of other kings and that lived in
the Egyptian,

949
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:18,550
a region,
but they're considered to be fantasy 

950
00:50:19,241 --> 00:50:24,241
stories by archeologists.
The Pharaohs just like 34,000

951
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:26,560
years ago,
aren't there?

952
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:31,860
I mean,
I believe John Anthony West has stated 

953
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:31,860
that he goes back almost 30,000
or more years.

954
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:36,760
There is a,
there is a king's list out there and 

955
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,030
everybody can go google this tonight.
It's called WB 44.

956
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:43,540
And that kings list absolutely will 
boggle your mind because it basically 

957
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:49,030
lists a combined age of kings that ruled
for a half a million years before our 

958
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:55,580
culture.
Now it's absolutely,

959
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:58,100
it's absolutely crazy.
And so,

960
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:03,130
and that is a list that can be found at 
the British Museum in England,

961
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,330
in London.

962
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:10,160
Where's it from?
It's from some area and the WB 44.

963
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:12,380
And it lists for how long,
how long,

964
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:15,140
how old?
For hundreds of thousands of years.

965
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:17,510
And some of these kings,
it says,

966
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:21,350
I have root for 16,000
years for 48,000

967
00:51:21,351 --> 00:51:22,340
years,
one day,

968
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:24,200
one king.
And then the question is,

969
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:29,201
well,
how is this even possible that operate 

970
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:29,201
the great type shit that were working 
that back then,

971
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:29,970
man?
Or they are,

972
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,610
we're talking about time,
dilation,

973
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:32,990
time,
dilation.

974
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:36,260
If you travel at close to the speed of 
light,

975
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:41,500
if on your spaceship,
five years pass and you travel at 99 

976
00:51:42,591 --> 00:51:44,540
point nine percent of the speed of 
light,

977
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:48,620
5,000
years pass here on earth.

978
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,560
And that's just the theory of 
relativity,

979
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,390
which is uh,
you know,

980
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:55,580
and it takes a time,
dilation into account.

981
00:51:55,581 --> 00:51:57,860
I mean,
like anyone that flies a lot,

982
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,870
those people are actually aging slower 
than the rest of us.

983
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,590
So the more you are in motion,
the slower you age.

984
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,860
And so this is a mathematically viable 
and proven theory that if you travel 

985
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:14,990
clothes,
which,

986
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,900
which of course we,
we are not capable of doing it.

987
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:22,370
But just because we human beings can't 
do it doesn't mean it does not exist.

988
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:24,150
And that's the big,
you know,

989
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:28,760
arc is dude would like come down here,
fuck some shit and go yo,

990
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,340
I'll be right back.
Then it comes back like 16,000

991
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:33,650
years because to him it's only a year.
Yep,

992
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:38,860
exactly.
It goes to the speed of light or 

993
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:38,860
whatever the hell he goes.
And he comes back.

994
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,890
Yes.
And it sounds like science fiction.

995
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,160
But who says that?
That is not possible.

996
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:47,750
That's an interesting way to stay valid.
It just say,

997
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:52,751
listen bitch,
I am coming back and then you actually 

998
00:52:52,751 --> 00:52:55,721
do come back and don't.
And those are the stories that we find 

999
00:52:55,721 --> 00:52:56,600
that these,
quote unquote gods,

1000
00:52:56,601 --> 00:52:58,430
which by the way,
they never existed.

1001
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:02,110
It's all lower case g,
there is no such thing as God's.

1002
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:02,670
I mean it's,
it's,

1003
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,640
it's completely,
uh,

1004
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:09,641
it was a complete misunderstanding,
a misinterpretation of our ancestors who

1005
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:14,480
didn't understand the nuts and bolts 
technologies behind these visits.

1006
00:53:14,481 --> 00:53:19,481
And so they started to worship these 
people and those visitors knew exactly 

1007
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,490
that they were being worshiped because 
you know,

1008
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:27,491
it will be the same thing that if we 
arrive on a planet one day in the 

1009
00:53:27,491 --> 00:53:27,530
future,
$5,000

1010
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,880
or whatever years from now and we find a
quote unquote intelligent species,

1011
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:35,550
but they're a bit primitive.
Yeah,

1012
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:36,030
well,
you know,

1013
00:53:36,031 --> 00:53:37,860
we'll push them a little bit in the 
right direction,

1014
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:39,020
show them how to,
you know,

1015
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,830
to complete agriculture and medicine and
architecture and all those things.

1016
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:46,500
And then we'll just say,
okay,

1017
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:48,030
we're,
we're gonna disappear again.

1018
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:53,090
Well guess what?
Our once real visit will turn into will 

1019
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:58,370
enter the realm of mythology a thousand 
or 2000 years after our visit.

1020
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,920
And so one day all of us,
all human beings will become ancient 

1021
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,490
astronauts on some other planets.
It's just,

1022
00:54:05,491 --> 00:54:08,720
it's just the eternal.
We'll have a question of,

1023
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:12,680
you're a master of ancient cultures.
Most ancient culture to get,

1024
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,570
get up,
get up close to the engine cultures,

1025
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:20,870
have some kind of 2012 a warning or a 
signifies the end of some age.

1026
00:54:24,631 --> 00:54:26,000
Or what do you think,
you know,

1027
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,540
I,
uh,

1028
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:32,780
you know,
I really need you to pay attention to 

1029
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,301
this because I think that the biggest 
threat that we face on December 22nd 

1030
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:41,750
2012 is the massive hangover will all be
suffering.

1031
00:54:43,351 --> 00:54:48,351
So that's about it because a lot of 2012
stuff with a Zacharias of course.

1032
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:50,790
So,
you know,

1033
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,280
here's the thing that would message and 
think through was gonna,

1034
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:58,200
you know,
even though took a year away,

1035
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,610
when we build it,
look,

1036
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,670
here's the thing that,
you know,

1037
00:55:02,671 --> 00:55:07,671
the whole thing,
in my opinion is nothing else but a 

1038
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:07,671
complete.

1039
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,250
Um,
it's,

1040
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:12,540
it's a mass hysteria.
Absolutely.

1041
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,520
Because now,
yeah,

1042
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:15,420
well,
he,

1043
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,080
even,
he,

1044
00:55:16,081 --> 00:55:21,081
uh,
he wrote right before or a year before 

1045
00:55:21,081 --> 00:55:21,390
he died,
he rephrased his,

1046
00:55:21,391 --> 00:55:24,080
um,
theory by saying that if,

1047
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,550
if,
if at all in the bureau were to return,

1048
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,260
it's going to be around 20,
36 or 38 or something changed it.

1049
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,640
Absolutely.
Yes.

1050
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:38,030
But you know,
that's neither here nor there because 

1051
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,330
the bottom line is that the big problem 
with 2012 is the fact that it's not even

1052
00:55:42,391 --> 00:55:45,090
2011 right now.
That's what nobody talks about,

1053
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,380
that you know,
we,

1054
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,680
our calendar is wrong because if there's
a couple of arguments that you can make,

1055
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:53,750
and that is,
you know,

1056
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,460
if you look at our code and code 
history,

1057
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,470
we went from one BC,
two,

1058
00:55:58,471 --> 00:56:03,471
one add without a year zero,
which means that we are already at least

1059
00:56:04,231 --> 00:56:09,231
by one year off.
So it's either 2012 or ready or it's 

1060
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:09,231
still 2010.

1061
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:14,000
And then you know,
we don't know whether or not our 

1062
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,181
calendar.
We also know that Jesus was not born in 

1063
00:56:18,691 --> 00:56:23,691
the year zero,
but scholars and I'm talking 

1064
00:56:23,691 --> 00:56:23,930
theologians,
theological scholars now have determined

1065
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:28,950
that Jesus was born between five and 
three add.

1066
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,780
So right,
they're worn exactly.

1067
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:36,640
So right there,
we've got another five years considering

1068
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:40,240
the fact that we were being told that 
our calendar began ticking on the day of

1069
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:44,350
Jesus's birth.
So long story short in the third,

1070
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:49,380
our third argument is also that it isn't
now Berkeley scholars and scholars in 

1071
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:55,950
the university in a university in Rome 
have determined that in the Middle Ages 

1072
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,400
when the monks were in charge of 
recording our dates and everything like 

1073
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:07,330
that,
that they also made a mistake up to five

1074
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:12,480
years.
So the interesting thing is that to make

1075
00:57:12,671 --> 00:57:17,671
a long story short that we could be as 
far off as 10 years with our current 

1076
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:23,521
date and if you take into consideration 
when did our calendar really start 

1077
00:57:24,911 --> 00:57:25,270
ticking?

1078
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,080
Was it at the,
at the time when Jesus died or was it at

1079
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:31,660
the time when he was nailed to the 
cross?

1080
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:36,900
Who knows these things?
I mean some have suggested that we're 

1081
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,020
off by 200 years and these are not 
people that,

1082
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:41,530
you know,
I'm just pulling this stuff out of their

1083
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:46,620
butts,
but they are scholars at universities 

1084
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:49,480
who have studied this stuff.
And so the bottom line is that the whole

1085
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:54,750
2012,
it's nothing else but complete hysteria 

1086
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,640
and nothing.
Let me repeat.

1087
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,360
Absolutely nothing will happen next 
year.

1088
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,730
Dude,
what you got to talk to Daniel Pinchbeck

1089
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,710
because he's written books and he 
doesn't agree with you.

1090
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,800
That's fine.
He thinks quite so positive and God 

1091
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:10,800
bless them and quit.
So creditable,

1092
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,310
not come.
Now,

1093
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:13,990
that didn't.
By the way,

1094
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,190
by the way,
quizlet.

1095
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,680
Corrado was an exit terrestrial 
spaceship.

1096
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:18,970
Do you think so?
Absolutely.

1097
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:24,570
Didn't they predict that um,
the Mayans pr accurately predicted the 

1098
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:27,940
solar lunar eclipses in the future.

1099
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:33,300
So if they predicted that,
how is it possible that we say they 

1100
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:33,300
predicted it,
right?

1101
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,250
We must be following their timeline.
If following their timeline,

1102
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,430
then the must be 2012.
Oh No,

1103
00:58:39,431 --> 00:58:40,660
absolutely.
You're right.

1104
00:58:40,661 --> 00:58:45,661
But if,
if our calendar from the very beginning 

1105
00:58:45,661 --> 00:58:45,820
was,
is wrong,

1106
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,690
then we are basing our wrong calendar on
their calculation.

1107
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:55,350
Right?
But if we're basing our wrong calendar 

1108
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:55,930
on their calculations and it lines up 
with what we call 19,

1109
00:58:55,931 --> 00:58:58,000
19 with,
we call it 2012,

1110
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,560
then shouldn't it be that they got the 
lunar eclipses right?

1111
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,150
So they got 2012,
right?

1112
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,940
No,
they definitely have 2012.

1113
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:08,170
Right?
And by the way,

1114
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,360
the deal,
yes,

1115
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:14,440
but not yes in their counting in their 
town but not ours.

1116
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:18,190
Yes.
But how is their accounting like line up

1117
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:23,191
exactly with ours when it comes to the 
prediction of solar and lunar eclipses 

1118
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:23,191
then?
Well,

1119
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:25,880
soon and lunar eclipses it doesn't 
matter what you're in.

1120
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:26,830
Right?
But they,

1121
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:31,890
they accurately depicted the year that 
the solar and lunar eclipses according 

1122
00:59:32,691 --> 00:59:34,490
to our talent.
But we impose,

1123
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:37,500
we super imposed.
They're counting onto ours.

1124
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,640
So we tried to make it fit.
Yes,

1125
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:41,580
exactly.
Okay.

1126
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,840
So you see,
and here's the other thing that's tricky

1127
00:59:44,841 --> 00:59:49,841
when you get to calendars to right,
like one a completely different type of 

1128
00:59:49,841 --> 00:59:53,800
calendar than ours.
And so there must be something happened 

1129
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,110
and then to December 20,
first 2012,

1130
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:58,520
I must signify at the end of the 13th,
what does that mean?

1131
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:02,240
And that is the long couch and that is 
the exact thing that you know,

1132
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,300
the Mayans,
not once,

1133
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:09,410
not once did they ever say that the 
world was going to end.

1134
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:14,411
The only thing they said is that one 
period of time ends and a new period of 

1135
01:00:14,931 --> 01:00:18,260
time begins.
So it could be that you know,

1136
01:00:18,261 --> 01:00:23,261
if you believe,
some people believe that time has a 

1137
01:00:23,261 --> 01:00:26,311
certain qualities to it,
that there are times when things are 

1138
01:00:26,311 --> 01:00:28,871
easier and times and things are harder 
and that this is literally like an ebb 

1139
01:00:28,871 --> 01:00:30,530
and flow,
like the tines and that perhaps with the

1140
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:35,531
Mayans were predicting is just some new 
stage of humanity,

1141
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:40,631
some new stage of existence,
some new states with the earth and the 

1142
01:00:40,631 --> 01:00:43,091
universe that this thing just things 
just keep flowing in this sort of a 

1143
01:00:43,091 --> 01:00:43,091
circular direction.

1144
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:44,120
Well,
yeah,

1145
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:47,270
I mean look at everything as we know is,
is cyclical.

1146
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:50,020
So yeah.
So that is definitely in this.

1147
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,100
They mastered the procession of the 
equinoxes and they had figured that out.

1148
01:00:55,130 --> 01:01:00,130
They had figured out a lot of cycles 
that would really complex who taught 

1149
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:03,791
them this and they're also very true 
mushrooms and a lot of free time also.

1150
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:08,120
So the aliens who were dressed up as 
little mushroom mascot,

1151
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:13,010
what it is,
what do you say to people that say,

1152
01:01:13,011 --> 01:01:17,100
well,
how do we know Jesus really even exist?

1153
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:20,660
They're like dvds and stuff that did was
that DVD,

1154
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:25,690
the God that God wasn't there.
It wasn't that there was a lot of kind 

1155
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:27,710
of argue scientifically that he's not a,
not a real figure.

1156
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:28,970
I,
you know,

1157
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:33,770
I personally think that Jesus,
100 percent was a historical figure.

1158
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,150
He was an alien.
No,

1159
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:35,960
no,
no.

1160
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,520
And,
and neither was Buddha and neither were 

1161
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:41,560
any of the other quote unquote 
astronaut.

1162
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,150
No,
no,

1163
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:45,320
I just think that,
you know,

1164
01:01:45,321 --> 01:01:49,310
Jesus was a historical figure,
was able to move people,

1165
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:50,630
but uh,
that,

1166
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,260
that,
uh,

1167
01:01:51,261 --> 01:01:53,360
he was the son of God,
in my opinion,

1168
01:01:53,361 --> 01:01:56,750
is nonsense because we are all the sons 
and daughters of God.

1169
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,710
We all have the divine within our 
hearts.

1170
01:01:58,711 --> 01:01:59,780
So what kind of proof,
I mean,

1171
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:01,310
you've studied a lot of ancient 
cultures,

1172
01:02:01,311 --> 01:02:03,680
obviously.
What do you know of any proof that.

1173
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:07,640
What did Jesus exist exactly?
Well,

1174
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,390
I mean,
we've had,

1175
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:14,470
we have stories.
We have texts that have been written 

1176
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:15,650
down at the time,
the,

1177
01:02:15,651 --> 01:02:19,320
like the Qumran texts to have the Dead 
Sea scrolls and things like that.

1178
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:20,610
So,
I mean,

1179
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,150
obviously nobody took a picture and the,
you know,

1180
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:29,190
there are some in Texas where you get 
real squirrely because the dead sea 

1181
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:32,781
scrolls,
that's where it's the trace it back to 

1182
01:02:32,781 --> 01:02:35,661
an ancient Sumerian where Christ is an 
ancient Sumerian word that means a 

1183
01:02:35,661 --> 01:02:35,810
mushroom covered in God's semen.

1184
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,120
Well,
interesting on Marco Allegro Story.

1185
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,070
Yes.
Although interestingly enough,

1186
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:46,490
what's also fascinating,
what many people don't know is that 

1187
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:49,050
before Jesus,
they were 15 other crucified,

1188
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:54,051
quote unquote saviors in human history.
And so it's all very bizarre that,

1189
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,220
uh,
you know,

1190
01:02:56,370 --> 01:03:01,370
Christianity claims that he was the only
one which is completely untrue.

1191
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,860
And when you measure his story next to 
all these other stores,

1192
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:06,300
I mean,
even Hercules,

1193
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:09,450
Hercules and Jesus,
pretty fucking close.

1194
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,970
Lot of Goddamn similarities.
You know,

1195
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:12,890
it's,
it's,

1196
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,510
it's pretty obvious that we've always 
been looking for a savior.

1197
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,360
I've always been looking for a one,
a one thing.

1198
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:22,290
And I think that's just some Alpha male 
chimpanzee thing.

1199
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:25,860
When you look for the Alpha and you 
think somehow,

1200
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,990
you know,
the one at one point in time there was a

1201
01:03:27,991 --> 01:03:30,660
super alpha and the Super Alpha had all 
the answers.

1202
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,420
Is it just a myth to keep people going?

1203
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,060
What does that mean?
What is the need for this,

1204
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:41,190
this Super Alpha?
Do you think that it signifies this 

1205
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,160
alien intervention in human history?
Is that what you're.

1206
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,060
Is that what you personally believe?
No,

1207
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:50,090
I,
I just think that a lot of times people 

1208
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:54,321
are not happy with their own thoughts 
that they need to,

1209
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,870
but this Athena,
one time,

1210
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,710
there was a god.
The theme exists in all of them.

1211
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:06,890
All of the different religions all talk 
about one point in time there was a god 

1212
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:09,810
and this God had all the answers.
This is the shit that he wrote down,

1213
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:13,310
but this is the shit that he told me.
Here's the thing that you know,

1214
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,790
I mean,
uh,

1215
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:18,810
if you want to look at the Old Testament
where we have a description of quote 

1216
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:21,870
unquote God in the ancient astronaut 
opinion,

1217
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:25,740
whatever or whoever with described in 
the Old Testament,

1218
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:28,890
and this is exclusively referring to the
Old Testament,

1219
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:31,220
has nothing to do with you'll shit.

1220
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:36,290
Yes.
That whatever or whoever was described 

1221
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,520
in the old testament by all means was 
not God.

1222
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:42,280
That being or that humanoid x,
uh,

1223
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:47,290
a creature that was here was 
misinterpreted or thought as God as 

1224
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:52,680
something divine,
something spiritual,

1225
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:57,681
something more advanced.
It was 100 percent Jesus because Jesus 

1226
01:04:57,681 --> 01:04:58,470
was an alien.
No,

1227
01:04:58,471 --> 01:05:00,630
I just said that has nothing to do with 
the New Testament,

1228
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,850
Old Testament,
old testament.

1229
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,490
God was an alien and Jesus,
no,

1230
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:10,780
it was not god.
That's the thing that I thought it was 

1231
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:12,480
God.
Because see,

1232
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:13,950
a lot of people say,
well,

1233
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:16,740
does that mean you were an atheist?
Does that mean you don't believe in God?

1234
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:19,210
And you know,
because a lot of the bunkers,

1235
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:24,990
or actually creationists are always 
using Albert Einstein as their best 

1236
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:28,540
example,
where they say,

1237
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:31,540
see even Albert Einstein,
he believes in God,

1238
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:35,020
so you know,
we must be right with our ideas.

1239
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:40,470
Well,
that is only half of the story because 

1240
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:40,960
when Albert Einstein was asked as a 
journalist,

1241
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:44,860
a,
when a journalist asked Albert Einstein,

1242
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:49,180
do you believe in God?
What Einstein said,

1243
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:54,270
and anyone can go and look this up,
is the fact that he replied by saying,

1244
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,280
well,
dear journalist,

1245
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:03,120
before I can answer your question,
we have to define what your definition 

1246
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,320
or your idea of God is.
And then the journalists said,

1247
01:06:08,321 --> 01:06:10,720
well,
I believe in the Old Testament,

1248
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:14,620
God and creator.
And then Albert said,

1249
01:06:14,621 --> 01:06:17,050
well,
if that is your definition of God,

1250
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:22,080
than I respectfully will tell you that I
do not believe in God and Tony's like 

1251
01:06:23,261 --> 01:06:25,270
wells in.
So what are you talking about?

1252
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:30,620
An Einstein then explained his 
definition are his idea of God and the 

1253
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,550
universe and the order that we have in 
the universe.

1254
01:06:32,551 --> 01:06:34,630
And it's chaos.
And he said,

1255
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,960
and if that is what what,
and this to me is my idea of God,

1256
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,390
that there is some order to the universe
because you know,

1257
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,850
God does not throw dice.

1258
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,860
That's one of his most famous quotes.
So there in lies the difference that,

1259
01:06:50,861 --> 01:06:55,861
yes,
I do think that there is an all 

1260
01:06:55,861 --> 01:06:57,370
encompassing force out there,
but it's not a personal god,

1261
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:58,750
it's not where,
you know,

1262
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:01,520
I pray and then all of a sudden,
you know,

1263
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:06,670
I'm praying for something to happen.
I mean that to me is a waste of time to 

1264
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:11,161
be honest with you.
It's like if you want something to 

1265
01:07:11,161 --> 01:07:13,801
happen,
you gotta go out there and do it 

1266
01:07:13,801 --> 01:07:15,721
yourself no matter what.
But I think the reason why the idea of 

1267
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:19,231
prayer exists is because people can 
manifest things with their own thoughts 

1268
01:07:19,231 --> 01:07:22,771
and staying positive and focusing on a 
goal and make yes to a certain extent 

1269
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:23,310
but thought.
But,

1270
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:27,160
but that to me is just thought that the 
idea of prayer,

1271
01:07:27,161 --> 01:07:28,890
prayer is just advanced thought,
right?

1272
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,530
Just a moment to the moment that they 
see that they're in,

1273
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,450
to me,
that's where it gets wacky.

1274
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,980
Because the moment that you correlate 
your own power,

1275
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:40,120
your own,
uh,

1276
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:45,630
you know,
the connection to the universe that you 

1277
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:48,661
have,
the moment that you connect that to a 

1278
01:07:48,661 --> 01:07:49,870
personal God and put everything that you
have,

1279
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:54,160
you basically deny all responsibility 
and you say,

1280
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:55,810
okay,
fine,

1281
01:07:55,930 --> 01:08:00,930
God will take care of it.
That to me is such a cop out attitude.

1282
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,560
It's like,
you know,

1283
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:08,040
why know,
be responsible for your own actions and 

1284
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,050
don't rely on someone.
I completely agree.

1285
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:13,840
But I think that that's where the idea 
of prayer came from.

1286
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:18,841
The reason why it exists to this day,
because you can sort of make things 

1287
01:08:18,841 --> 01:08:20,180
happen if you focus on them for a long 
period of time.

1288
01:08:20,181 --> 01:08:25,181
And people who have been successful at 
making things happen have like stepped 

1289
01:08:25,181 --> 01:08:25,181
back and said,
look,

1290
01:08:25,181 --> 01:08:26,630
you know,
we made this happen by prayer.

1291
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,720
We've thought this through.
Can we get a crop top or open it up?

1292
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:33,440
I'll just need one stop coughing for a 
little second.

1293
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:35,840
Poor little sicky Brian.
Now,

1294
01:08:35,841 --> 01:08:40,841
um,
you've been doing this for a long time 

1295
01:08:40,841 --> 01:08:40,841
now.
You said 1998.

1296
01:08:40,841 --> 01:08:41,030
You started out your,
your,

1297
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:46,060
your magazine.
How do you get approached to be doing 

1298
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:46,060
this ancient alien show?
How does this happen?

1299
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,200
Did they just seek out people with,
you know,

1300
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:52,370
sort of fringe beliefs and people that 
are experts on these subjects?

1301
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:57,400
No.
It was actually a very funny story and 

1302
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:57,400
that was,
if you remember,

1303
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,851
in 2008 that New Indiana Jones movie 
came out the Kingdom of the crystal 

1304
01:09:00,851 --> 01:09:03,650
skull and it's kind of a disaster of a 
movie.

1305
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:04,580
I,
in my opinion,

1306
01:09:04,581 --> 01:09:06,980
but they're making another one.
Can you believe it?

1307
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,580
To redeem themselves?
I hope they get worse.

1308
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,160
It can't get.
It can't get worse.

1309
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:16,010
They just don't seem to make in the 
same.

1310
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:21,170
Anyway,
the great thing about the movie itself 

1311
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:23,891
was the idea behind it was great,
but the execution was horrid.

1312
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,920
It was basic.
An ancient alien movie where,

1313
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:30,390
you know,
he was chasing the crystal skull.

1314
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,950
The Crystal Skull happened to be an 
extra terrestrial origin,

1315
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:35,660
this and that.
So,

1316
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:40,670
um,
the history channel made a two hour 

1317
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:42,290
documentary about Indiana Jones and the 
feasibility behind,

1318
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:42,860
uh,
you know,

1319
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:47,861
all this stuff that he chased down.
And so it was one segment about crystal 

1320
01:09:48,171 --> 01:09:53,171
skulls in which I appeared and talked 
about the possibility whether to Chris 

1321
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,770
Mitchell hedges skull,
for example,

1322
01:09:55,100 --> 01:10:00,100
was in fact,
or could in fact be an extraterrestrial 

1323
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,850
artifact.
And the Mitchell hedges skull is what is

1324
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:05,690
that the Mitchell had skull is one of 
the most perfect,

1325
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:11,080
the most perfect crystal m I t c h e l l
dash hedges h e d g e s Mitchell,

1326
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:21,700
hedges skull.
And that skull was found in beliefs by,

1327
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:25,970
by Michel headrest daughter on her 
birthday.

1328
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:31,630
And uh,
it's this crystal clear crystal that was

1329
01:10:33,741 --> 01:10:36,340
found in the shape of a humanoid head.

1330
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,790
I mean,
it's massive.

1331
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,920
It's really big.
If you go to the CRA,

1332
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:43,550
Mitchell hedges.com,
they have a countdown to revelation.

1333
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,900
It's gloom and doom once again.
I mean,

1334
01:10:47,901 --> 01:10:50,360
it's just crazy.
It's dope looking skull.

1335
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,780
And what did you say about this called?
And some of them have been disproved,

1336
01:10:53,781 --> 01:10:54,610
right?
But this one hasn't.

1337
01:10:54,611 --> 01:10:56,770
And then there's no question about that.
And the fact that,

1338
01:10:56,771 --> 01:10:58,250
you know,
with this one here,

1339
01:10:58,270 --> 01:11:00,960
it's,
it's so magnificent where the,

1340
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:03,750
you can actually detach the jawbone,
uh,

1341
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:07,520
from it any which means that the pain,
it's from the same crystal,

1342
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,760
which means it had to be one big fricken
rock out of which this whole thing was,

1343
01:11:13,651 --> 01:11:16,980
was made.
And when was it found?

1344
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:20,030
Are they in the early 19 hundreds?
And when,

1345
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:22,790
when Mitchell hedges or the actual,
um,

1346
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,340
caretaker a after Mitchell had just died
and,

1347
01:11:26,341 --> 01:11:31,341
and Anna took over or kept the skull,
she and her,

1348
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,590
this other dude who's name escapes me 
right now,

1349
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:38,250
I think it's Dan in this arena or 
something.

1350
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:43,610
They brought it in the 19 sixties to the
labs up in the bay area of Hewlett 

1351
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,700
Packard.
And even in the day,

1352
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:51,660
of course,
only the best scientists worked at these

1353
01:11:51,661 --> 01:11:53,170
particular,
uh,

1354
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,930
you know,
factories and labs.

1355
01:11:55,470 --> 01:12:00,470
And when the Hewlett Packard scientists,
we're done with all their research,

1356
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:07,050
their conclusion was very simple.
And they said,

1357
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:08,790
and I quote,
this,

1358
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:13,791
golf should not exist.
And a meaning that it was,

1359
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:19,670
they did not find any tool marks that 
did not find any polished or any 

1360
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,660
evidence that this thing was polished or
anything like that.

1361
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,870
And even more crazy is the fact that 
each crystal,

1362
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:30,120
it grows in a particular access.
And in order to work crystal,

1363
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:35,121
you have to turn to crystal at high 
speeds in that direction of the access.

1364
01:12:35,281 --> 01:12:37,620
And according to the Hewlett Packard 
people,

1365
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:42,980
it was ground against its grain and that
would shatter every crystal that you 

1366
01:12:45,391 --> 01:12:46,230
would do this too.

1367
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:47,960
And the crystal Hydros I mean the 
Mitchell,

1368
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,710
his skull,
um,

1369
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:52,410
it,
it still exists and it shouldn't.

1370
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:55,350
So it's,
it's a big mystery and yes,

1371
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,030
like,
you know,

1372
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:59,550
some crystal skulls have been determined
that they are,

1373
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,440
you know,
modern day creations,

1374
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:05,180
but not to Mitchell address.
Again,

1375
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:06,510
that could be another tool that we're 
not.

1376
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:09,750
They used to have back in the day that 
we're not thinking about that.

1377
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,800
Right,
of course,

1378
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,710
of course.
Sure.

1379
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:17,060
Of course.
So this is how you got hooked up with 

1380
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:17,060
the history channel and then they're 
like,

1381
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,630
we like to do with crazy hair,
you know,

1382
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:20,790
anything about Nazis.
No.

1383
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,150
And denied.
Then I got a call and I was asking,

1384
01:13:23,151 --> 01:13:24,540
you know,
have I had,

1385
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:29,541
I heard of a,
of a book called chariots of the Gods 

1386
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:29,541
and Eric Fund,
Danica.

1387
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:29,850
And I said,
of course,

1388
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:35,090
you know,
we publish a magazine together in this 

1389
01:13:35,090 --> 01:13:35,190
and that and here we are today.
I mean,

1390
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:37,020
it was just a,
an idea to,

1391
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:42,021
to shoot a,
a two hour documentary 40 years after 

1392
01:13:42,021 --> 01:13:43,440
chariots of the gods,
an argument

1393
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,620
with a journalist when I first came to 
Hollywood wasn't really an argument.

1394
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:49,330
It was a talk at one of these.
They had these,

1395
01:13:49,331 --> 01:13:50,880
uh,
it was fox,

1396
01:13:50,881 --> 01:13:53,750
I was on Fox and had a party for a 
Sitcom I was on.

1397
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,010
And a guy said,
hey,

1398
01:13:56,011 --> 01:13:57,270
can I ask you a couple of questions?
And he goes,

1399
01:13:57,271 --> 01:14:02,271
okay.
So he rattles off a bunch of questions 

1400
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:02,271
and one of them was,
do you believe in aliens?

1401
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:04,080
And uh,
I think I said yeah.

1402
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:05,610
And he said,
why?

1403
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:06,360
And I said,
well,

1404
01:14:06,361 --> 01:14:07,920
I saw this thing,
chariots of the gods,

1405
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:11,390
and it's a pretty incredible movie and I
think it's,

1406
01:14:11,391 --> 01:14:12,280
it's more

1407
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,540
than possible.
It's a lot of stars out there.

1408
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:16,780
And he started going off on how chariots
of the gods it was bullshit.

1409
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:17,710
And he goes,
oh,

1410
01:14:17,711 --> 01:14:22,711
it's been completely debunked.
And so I'm pretty calm about that kind 

1411
01:14:22,711 --> 01:14:22,711
of stuff.
I go,

1412
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,250
alright,
well how is it debunked?

1413
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:25,720
And he had no answer.
And I said,

1414
01:14:25,721 --> 01:14:27,780
but yet you're so convinced that as 
debunked.

1415
01:14:27,781 --> 01:14:29,440
But I know,
I know I read that had been debunked.

1416
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,450
I go,
but you don't remember what you read,

1417
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,450
but yet what did,
did you reach out to the gods?

1418
01:14:34,451 --> 01:14:34,900
And he's like,
no,

1419
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:35,980
I didn't read it,
but I mean,

1420
01:14:35,981 --> 01:14:40,981
I know it's all about aliens.
And aliens came and made these 

1421
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:41,140
structures and was like,
wow,

1422
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,430
dude,
you're pretty convinced.

1423
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:47,380
But it was like a sensible man doesn't 
believe such silly things.

1424
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:51,130
And that is the,
the whole attitude about aliens,

1425
01:14:51,131 --> 01:14:53,590
about extra terrestrials or even about 
ancient civilizations.

1426
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:56,920
And these sensible man doesn't buy into 
such nonsense.

1427
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:59,530
And you must have had to deal with that 
your whole fucking life.

1428
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,850
Oh No,
absolutely.

1429
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,880
And that's the thing where you just go 
wacky with the hair and the jewelry and 

1430
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:06,250
I fucking bitch.
I'm going deep.

1431
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,200
Yeah.
Crazy whole.

1432
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:10,270
I'm still the same guy from 10 years 
ago,

1433
01:15:10,271 --> 01:15:11,410
you know,
that's the thing that,

1434
01:15:11,411 --> 01:15:12,640
you know,
it's like,

1435
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:14,200
to me,
you know,

1436
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:17,650
especially the chariots of the gods 
argument that,

1437
01:15:17,651 --> 01:15:20,290
you know from Danica has been debunked 
and things like that.

1438
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:21,640
It's like really,
I mean,

1439
01:15:21,641 --> 01:15:25,210
have you looked at this stuff?
Because the bottom line is that chariots

1440
01:15:25,211 --> 01:15:30,211
of the gods had over 200 question marks 
in it and even had a fricking question 

1441
01:15:30,211 --> 01:15:31,810
wanting to fucking title.
So,

1442
01:15:31,811 --> 01:15:32,710
I mean,
right,

1443
01:15:32,711 --> 01:15:37,630
there was a question.
It is a idea.

1444
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:42,660
It's raising questions.
And if those questions happen to be 

1445
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:43,300
uncomfortable questions,
well,

1446
01:15:43,301 --> 01:15:48,301
you know what,
so be it because a couple of them are 

1447
01:15:48,301 --> 01:15:48,301
wrong.

1448
01:15:48,301 --> 01:15:48,301
You're talking about a lot of Goddamn 
questions.

1449
01:15:48,301 --> 01:15:49,420
No.
Here's the thing.

1450
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:50,620
And let me,
let me ask you this.

1451
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:53,530
When was the last time you saw as 
scientist or,

1452
01:15:53,531 --> 01:15:55,870
or any author or whatever,
uh,

1453
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,740
give,
uh,

1454
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:01,820
you know,
30 years after they first publication 

1455
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:01,820
and say,
well,

1456
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:02,560
you know,
on page,

1457
01:16:02,561 --> 01:16:07,561
so and so,
I made a mistake when chariots of the 

1458
01:16:07,561 --> 01:16:10,591
gods came out as the 35 year addition to
35 year anniversary edition.

1459
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:17,370
Eric wrote a 16 page of preface to the 
new edition.

1460
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:23,660
And in that he pointed out exactly what 
we,

1461
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:28,800
which mistakes he made in the 1968 or 
1970 brooke on what page?

1462
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:31,560
And on,
you know,

1463
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:33,190
what happened here,
for example,

1464
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:35,440
one example is the,
that uh,

1465
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:41,310
uh,
the iron pillar in New Delhi for a long 

1466
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:41,310
time,
you know,

1467
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:46,680
we thought that this might be something 
that is of extraterrestrial origin or at

1468
01:16:47,531 --> 01:16:50,200
least that extra terrestrials taught 
nice metallurgist.

1469
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:54,400
How to poor this,
a pillar of iron because up to that time

1470
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,680
it didn't corrode.
It didn't rust.

1471
01:16:56,681 --> 01:16:59,440
And it's been,
it had been around for many,

1472
01:16:59,441 --> 01:17:01,630
many years,
know hundreds and hundreds of years.

1473
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:04,600
And guess what,
the thing is rusting today.

1474
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:09,750
It's corroding.
So you know what that piece of evidence 

1475
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:09,980
out the,
you know what,

1476
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:15,040
who cares?
Because the conclusion is that it in in 

1477
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:19,550
case a piece of evidence turns out to be
wrong or false.

1478
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:24,850
If you eliminate that piece of evidence,
it only makes the overall theory 

1479
01:17:25,581 --> 01:17:29,480
stronger because you eliminate false 
stuff.

1480
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:34,900
So to suggest that just because there 
were a few mistakes and chairs of the 

1481
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:38,120
gods which Eric openly admitted to,
that doesn't mean that the whole ancient

1482
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:40,460
alien theory all of a sudden becomes 
irrelevant.

1483
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:43,040
On the contrary,
it makes it more stronger.

1484
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:47,000
And the fact that today,
especially on the show,

1485
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:48,980
ancient aliens,
I mean,

1486
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:52,220
by the way,
tomorrow is the premier of season three.

1487
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,440
I'm very excited about that.
What's going on?

1488
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:57,220
What's going well?
Can you preview us?

1489
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:00,080
Can you tell us to have some scoops?
Any Nazi stuff?

1490
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:05,820
There's definitely stuff in there that 
has not been explored in the previous 

1491
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,510
season.
History channel needs to combine Nazis,

1492
01:18:08,511 --> 01:18:13,511
Ufo and ghost together and monsters.
One are fucking smash them up show.

1493
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:17,270
And uh,
you know,

1494
01:18:17,271 --> 01:18:22,271
so I lost my train of thought was a 
season of the history exactly his 

1495
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,000
special,
especially now in season three.

1496
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:31,330
It's amazing how many university 
professors have come forward and agreed 

1497
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:36,050
to be on a show called ancient fucking 
aliens.

1498
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:40,040
Are you kidding me?
The fact that university professors,

1499
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,340
because as you know,
you,

1500
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:47,380
you're in TV,
you have to disclose what show you're 

1501
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:47,720
calling from or what show you're going 
to be on.

1502
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,840
You can't just,
you know,

1503
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:53,900
put a question mark there.
So the fact that university professors 

1504
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,800
are now coming forward,
especially for season three to appear on

1505
01:18:57,801 --> 01:19:00,380
that show,
I mean that speaks volumes.

1506
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,730
I mean,
it's huge that,

1507
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,200
that all of a sudden,
you know,

1508
01:19:03,201 --> 01:19:05,960
Eric von Daniken children's and I and 
Martell and coppens,

1509
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:11,140
we're surrounded by people from mit 
talking about ancient aliens and what 

1510
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:12,340
exactly these,
uh,

1511
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:15,160
professors about what is their,
their,

1512
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:16,940
their subjects of expertise,
what do they,

1513
01:19:16,941 --> 01:19:17,530
uh,
well,

1514
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:18,980
we,
we've,

1515
01:19:18,981 --> 01:19:23,981
for example,
in this episode that airs tomorrow and 

1516
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:29,260
Aliens and the old West,
we have a professor is not only do we 

1517
01:19:29,841 --> 01:19:33,140
have elders,
a native American elders who are talking

1518
01:19:33,141 --> 01:19:37,400
about the idea of star people in,
in the ancient American west,

1519
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:42,940
but also there are professors that we've
gotten from universities and curators of

1520
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:50,051
museums where they corroborate the 
stories about the star people.

1521
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:54,470
And so which one do they do that well 
because they,

1522
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,600
they are,
uh,

1523
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:00,760
they have access to many,
many recordings that were written down 

1524
01:20:02,421 --> 01:20:05,270
by a previous,
um,

1525
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:11,310
in the old west.
Things for the first time would be able 

1526
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:14,271
to be recorded because in ancient native
American times their traditions were 

1527
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:19,770
brought from generation to generation 
and words.

1528
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:21,210
Spoken words.
Exactly.

1529
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:26,600
And then when white men came,
I guess unfortunately the,

1530
01:20:27,331 --> 01:20:32,331
you know,
the whole thing was recorded all of a 

1531
01:20:32,331 --> 01:20:34,521
sudden.
And so we have very old recordings 

1532
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,340
talking about these star people that 
came allegedly a long time ago.

1533
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:43,550
And so that is a huge,
huge part of our theory that there are 

1534
01:20:45,991 --> 01:20:47,730
entire cultures,
for example,

1535
01:20:47,731 --> 01:20:52,731
native Americans that talk about the 
Kachinas descending from the sky in 

1536
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:59,540
flying shields.
And they were very adamant because of 

1537
01:20:59,540 --> 01:20:59,880
course native Americans,
you know,

1538
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:03,690
believe in the spiritual realm,
there's no question,

1539
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:08,250
but they're also very adamant to say 
that there are two worlds,

1540
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:13,430
there is the spiritual realm.
And then there is also the physical 

1541
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:18,171
realm and vet the star.
People were part of the physical realm.

1542
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,850
And here we are to say,
oh well,

1543
01:21:20,851 --> 01:21:25,851
you know,
they didn't know what they were talking 

1544
01:21:25,851 --> 01:21:25,851
because they were just all,
hi there,

1545
01:21:25,851 --> 01:21:25,851
we're getting that pod.

1546
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,120
Which,
you know,

1547
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:32,130
I mean,
of course there is not one culture in 

1548
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:34,560
the world that did not dabble in,
in mind altering drugs.

1549
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:35,460
I mean,
it's just a,

1550
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:37,500
a,
a complete,

1551
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:40,860
uh,
it's who we are as a people.

1552
01:21:40,861 --> 01:21:45,861
There is no question about that,
but at the same time there were always 

1553
01:21:45,861 --> 01:21:50,241
these different levels that yes,
there's absolutely no doubt in my mind 

1554
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:55,490
that the spiritual realm does exist,
but we also have a physical realm in 

1555
01:21:56,341 --> 01:22:01,341
which our ancestors said that somebody 
came in a physical form,

1556
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:07,160
so you think that there's probably some 
sort of an advanced life or some sort of

1557
01:22:07,981 --> 01:22:12,180
a different life in a,
in a nonmaterial form as well.

1558
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:15,510
Like there's some sort of a spiritual 
realm,

1559
01:22:15,511 --> 01:22:18,570
100 percent chin or something like have 
something,

1560
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,820
something else,
some sort of intelligent life,

1561
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,610
and then there's physical life is,
and you know me,

1562
01:22:23,611 --> 01:22:25,350
I'm the nuts and bolts alien guy.

1563
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:30,350
Right?
But at the same time I would be a fool 

1564
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:33,560
to deny or to even suggest that that a 
ethereal realm does not exist because 

1565
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:40,790
that would render our physical world 
completely useless if that's all there 

1566
01:22:41,251 --> 01:22:42,660
is.
Because a lot of people are saying,

1567
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:43,080
well,
you know,

1568
01:22:43,081 --> 01:22:45,660
if you die,
all it's going to happen is that,

1569
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:50,661
you know,
they're gonna basically just pull the 

1570
01:22:50,661 --> 01:22:51,060
plug from the computer.
Hard drive and things like that.

1571
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:53,520
And that's usually the argument that 
they give,

1572
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:58,970
but the bottom line is that's not 
necessarily true because if you keep 

1573
01:22:59,191 --> 01:23:04,191
your computer in a very safe place and 
you can leave it there unplugged for a 

1574
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:11,040
years.
If you find a power source a million 

1575
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:11,680
years down the road and you plug that 
computer back in,

1576
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:16,950
guess what?
Everything on that hard drive is still 

1577
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:17,350
there.
So what if the hard drive is to soul?

1578
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:21,700
And therefore once we die,
our souls goes with us.

1579
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:26,320
That's who we are as an essence.
Yes we will leave this body,

1580
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:30,850
but at the same time energy does not 
die.

1581
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,960
It goes on in some form.
So to suggest that after this life,

1582
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:38,560
it's all over.
I cannot process that.

1583
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:43,750
Do Kurtzweil and Ray Kurzweil's ideas of
downloading human consciousness into,

1584
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,430
into intelligent computers.
And the idea of your,

1585
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:53,520
you will be able to duplicate yourself 
and live forever in some sort of cyber 

1586
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:58,051
environment.
I think it's fascinating and you know 

1587
01:23:58,051 --> 01:23:58,150
what happens with the,
you know,

1588
01:23:58,151 --> 01:24:00,940
the spiritual version of you.
If that takes place,

1589
01:24:00,941 --> 01:24:05,941
you know,
well maybe then that's where you live 

1590
01:24:05,941 --> 01:24:05,941
inside that,
inside that saddle zombies.

1591
01:24:05,941 --> 01:24:06,180
Yeah,
no,

1592
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:07,900
but the thing is you see,
and that's why you know,

1593
01:24:07,901 --> 01:24:12,901
movies like the Matrix are so the first 
one was so wonderful because those are 

1594
01:24:13,121 --> 01:24:16,120
all fantastic,
interesting ideas.

1595
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,860
But to me I'm a big subscriber to 
reincarnation and uh,

1596
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:24,460
what I think because that because of 
energy not being able to die,

1597
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:26,980
and I think our soul,
our essence,

1598
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,400
his energy,
it's part of this all encompassing force

1599
01:24:30,401 --> 01:24:35,310
that to me is the universe or God.
And so you know,

1600
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:39,400
if you have,
if you look for example,

1601
01:24:39,401 --> 01:24:44,401
at the dialogue or a lot of Buddhists 
who believe in reincarnation or Hindus 

1602
01:24:44,401 --> 01:24:49,171
and things like that,
they always talk about how you will get 

1603
01:24:49,171 --> 01:24:53,161
reincarnated here on planet earth as 
another being or another animal or 

1604
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:54,280
whatever.
But see,

1605
01:24:54,281 --> 01:24:59,281
to me that's all very limited thinking 
because while I do subscribe to 

1606
01:24:59,281 --> 01:25:00,160
reincarnation,
there is no way,

1607
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:04,000
in my opinion that we would only 
reincarnate here on earth.

1608
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:07,600
We can reincarnate throughout the entire
universe.

1609
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:10,570
And that is why some people,
when they come back to Earth,

1610
01:25:10,571 --> 01:25:15,571
they're considered maybe old souls or 
they're more intuitive to everything 

1611
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:17,290
that they might've been here before.

1612
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:22,350
So using this one universal bank of 
souls for the entire universe and that 

1613
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:23,690
everybody has to tip into it no matter 
what you know,

1614
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:26,820
on planet fucking serious or whatever,
you know,

1615
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:27,310
you,
you,

1616
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:29,590
you all did for the same souls.
And so like,

1617
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:32,260
you could die here and then reemerge on 
planet,

1618
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:36,370
go fuck yourself in the middle of 
nowhere and somehow somehow with a,

1619
01:25:36,371 --> 01:25:41,371
but somehow with the same quote unquote 
instinct or knowledge because there's 

1620
01:25:41,371 --> 01:25:42,940
something that's out there.
It's called the,

1621
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,880
the eternal spirit.
And that is,

1622
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:48,340
uh,
that we all consist of,

1623
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:53,200
of particles and elements.
And every 60 days our entire bodies are,

1624
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:56,470
are completely recycled because I mean,
we're,

1625
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:59,650
we're completely changing tickets every 
seven years.

1626
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:00,250
Oh,
okay.

1627
01:26:00,251 --> 01:26:02,710
Well,
whatever I did or it's the,

1628
01:26:02,711 --> 01:26:06,840
it's the complete resection of a body,
which is absolutely mind boggling.

1629
01:26:06,841 --> 01:26:07,770
Yeah,
it's pretty crazy.

1630
01:26:07,771 --> 01:26:11,600
It's seven years and we're being 
bombarded by this cosmic dust.

1631
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,600
And that is what we consist of.
And this is one of French philosopher 

1632
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,430
John Shiran in his book called the 
eternal spirit.

1633
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:24,670
Uh,
the internal internal particles 

1634
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:24,670
suggested that,
um,

1635
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:28,870
each time one of our particles in our 
body travels through the universe,

1636
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:34,150
no matter what it passes through,
if it's a stone or a or some type of a 

1637
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:37,550
being or something,
it records everything.

1638
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,440
And so,
you know,

1639
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:44,270
each and every particle contains the 
knowledge of the entire universe.

1640
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,150
And that's within us.
I mean,

1641
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:51,160
it's the theory of things.
Recording things by Rupert Sheldrake,

1642
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,820
Tony,
you know who he is.

1643
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:53,790
Yes,
he has a,

1644
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:55,880
some sort of theory that things 
contained memory,

1645
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:58,070
houses,
tables,

1646
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:58,940
chairs,
everything.

1647
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,630
Because we're all made of the same 
stuff.

1648
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:03,680
And if that,
you know,

1649
01:27:03,681 --> 01:27:06,050
if these particles all record the same 
stuff,

1650
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,540
then you know,
we are all one.

1651
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,840
See if you take a piece of skin and you 
put it underneath the electron 

1652
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:16,430
microscope and you go deeper and deeper 
and deeper and deeper,

1653
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:17,750
everything wobbles.

1654
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:20,930
Everything vibrates.
It's all exciting down there.

1655
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:22,790
And uh,
you know,

1656
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,880
that's just who we are.
We consist of a vibration frequency.

1657
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:33,040
It's all harmonics.
Now you take a piece of this Metal Cup 

1658
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:37,631
right here,
which is considered to be inorganic or 

1659
01:27:37,631 --> 01:27:41,051
dead material and you put a little 
little piece under the same electron 

1660
01:27:41,051 --> 01:27:42,710
microscope and you go deeper and deeper 
and deeper.

1661
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,630
At the very,
very core,

1662
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:50,560
it's the exact same thing and I would 
challenge you for 100 bucks to tell me 

1663
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:53,910
which is which.
Nobody can tell.

1664
01:27:53,911 --> 01:27:58,911
I can tell the difference unless you 
know exactly which means we all exist of

1665
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:02,140
the same stuff.
Don't we all exist?

1666
01:28:02,141 --> 01:28:07,141
It actually has nothing.
I mean isn't like most of the universe 

1667
01:28:07,141 --> 01:28:07,230
and nothing changed.
The universe's most.

1668
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:11,760
Mostly Adams and most adams are almost 
entirely nothing and end.

1669
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:16,810
We consist of nothing too because while 
we can touch ourselves and touch other 

1670
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:18,050
people and the sensation of touch and 
all this,

1671
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:21,520
it's all complete its magnetism.

1672
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,680
I mean,
should use that as a trial,

1673
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:25,940
you know,
grab some chicks ass.

1674
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:29,120
I've touched nothing was nothing to 
touch.

1675
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:33,410
I have a question.
A lot of the stuff you're saying I agree

1676
01:28:33,411 --> 01:28:38,240
with and a lot of stuff they're saying.
Edgar Casey for instance,

1677
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:39,220
he was a.
he,

1678
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:42,440
he believed in the Akashic records and 
then he,

1679
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:43,970
um,
he can put them,

1680
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:47,560
he put his,
he put himself under hypnosis,

1681
01:28:47,561 --> 01:28:48,000
right?
Yes.

1682
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:53,470
Self hypnosis.
And then when he was an under south 

1683
01:28:53,470 --> 01:28:55,860
hypnosis,
he became this brilliant all knowing 

1684
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:58,331
man.
And he had a third grade education and 

1685
01:28:58,331 --> 01:28:58,331
he's,
he said that he's all,

1686
01:28:58,331 --> 01:29:01,160
this information can be tapped into by 
anybody.

1687
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:05,230
Just got to learn like meditation is 
part of it and that's why there's a big,

1688
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:10,270
you know,
meditation is huge and Yoga is huge 

1689
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:12,711
because once you master meditation,
you actually can tap into the Akashic 

1690
01:29:14,011 --> 01:29:16,830
records which holds the answers to 
everything.

1691
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:20,550
Where you Edgar Casey Fan,
did you follow him at all?

1692
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:25,820
No,
actually I really don't know much about 

1693
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:26,150
him.
But uh,

1694
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:31,160
you know,
it is true that you see we only use 

1695
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,660
about five percent of our entire brain 
power.

1696
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:36,060
Is that really true?
I've heard that's been debunked.

1697
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:37,800
Well,
even if let's say,

1698
01:29:37,801 --> 01:29:39,900
let's say it's,
let's say it's 10 percent,

1699
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,990
don't even think that's true.
I think they've debunked it.

1700
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:48,140
I think that was back when people were 
ignorant as about the functions of 

1701
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:50,961
different areas of the brain and now 
they've attributed different areas of 

1702
01:29:50,961 --> 01:29:53,631
the brain,
two different functions and I think the 

1703
01:29:53,631 --> 01:29:53,631
more they understand about the brain,
the more they realize that that's,

1704
01:29:53,631 --> 01:29:55,920
that's a misnomer.
Have you driven down to four or five?

1705
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:57,790
You know,
he's still,

1706
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:59,730
believe it or not,
I'm not.

1707
01:29:59,731 --> 01:30:02,160
I'm not saying that these people are 
thinking,

1708
01:30:02,161 --> 01:30:04,020
well,
they even said like if you use more than

1709
01:30:04,021 --> 01:30:09,021
10 percent at the same time,
it would just go into seizures and 

1710
01:30:09,021 --> 01:30:09,021
stuff.

1711
01:30:09,021 --> 01:30:09,240
I think that's all worship.
I think that's all been disproven.

1712
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,680
I'm almost positive.
Yeah,

1713
01:30:10,681 --> 01:30:13,110
I believe what you were saying.
Well anyway,

1714
01:30:13,111 --> 01:30:14,550
so,
so the idea,

1715
01:30:14,551 --> 01:30:19,551
let's,
let's operate under the assumption that 

1716
01:30:19,551 --> 01:30:19,551
you know,
we,

1717
01:30:19,551 --> 01:30:22,570
we only use about eight,
five to eight percent of our total brain

1718
01:30:22,571 --> 01:30:25,770
power is one guy suggested a 
philosopher.

1719
01:30:25,771 --> 01:30:30,771
He said that the brain is the last 
untamed beast in the universe.

1720
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:35,520
And that is true because every single 
thing that we see each day,

1721
01:30:35,790 --> 01:30:39,630
every single thing that we hear,
everything that we say,

1722
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:44,670
our brains records it all.
Everything is there,

1723
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:48,300
everything is there permanently for 
eternity in our brains.

1724
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:52,290
The only problem is we can't access the 
information.

1725
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:55,590
And then of course there are people who 
are great at,

1726
01:30:56,240 --> 01:31:00,190
you know,
memorizing lines or memorizing texts or,

1727
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:03,750
or whatever or you know,
we'll have photographic memory,

1728
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,310
autism where they could,
I mean,

1729
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:06,960
well,
you know,

1730
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:07,650
and,
and also,

1731
01:31:07,651 --> 01:31:12,651
you know,
normally quote unquote functioning 

1732
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:12,651
people.

1733
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:12,651
I mean,
you know,

1734
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:12,651
it's,
it's,

1735
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:12,651
uh,
it's amazing how,

1736
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:17,700
you know,
some people have the code and code gift 

1737
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:17,910
to recall certain things and some people
don't.

1738
01:31:17,911 --> 01:31:20,270
And that is where I think,
you know,

1739
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:24,230
the last frontier lies that,
uh,

1740
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:29,240
we could conceivably access way more of 
our brain power and then you could move 

1741
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:35,600
proverbial mountains.
The 10 percent of the brain is 

1742
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:35,600
absolutely a myth.
Yeah.

1743
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:35,600
It's,
yeah,

1744
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,430
it's absolutely been proven.
It is actually a misinterpretation,

1745
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:43,460
a misquote of Albert Einstein or the 
misinterpretation of the work of Pierre 

1746
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:44,940
Florins in the 18 hundreds.
It's a,

1747
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:47,220
we use 100 percent of our brain.
They haven't mapped out.

1748
01:31:47,221 --> 01:31:50,400
They know what part of your brain works 
for different areas that did not know at

1749
01:31:50,401 --> 01:31:53,490
a certain point in time in history.
And that's when people started,

1750
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:58,510
you know,
kind of chirping that and sending it 

1751
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:58,510
back and forth.

1752
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:58,620
So through the wonders of the Internet,
we just cleared that up.

1753
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:02,230
And this is why you never stop learning.
Never.

1754
01:32:02,231 --> 01:32:05,640
Every day you learn something new.
Um,

1755
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:08,260
what do you think about all this Nazi 
shit because,

1756
01:32:08,261 --> 01:32:13,261
uh,
one of the things that's fascinating 

1757
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:15,271
about the ancient aliens show is how 
much the Nazis were into the occult and 

1758
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,210
uh,
the,

1759
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:23,240
the,
the Mahabharata and trying to recreate 

1760
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,120
things that were in ancient scriptures 
mean being Indiana Jones thing.

1761
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:26,890
They kind of got into it with the,
um,

1762
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:28,580
the um,
the,

1763
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:31,930
what is it called,
the Ark of the covenant and you know,

1764
01:32:31,931 --> 01:32:35,440
and that there's.
So there's something to it.

1765
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:37,930
And the Nazis were obsessed with that 
shit,

1766
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,570
but if they were just some fucking 
Kooks,

1767
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:43,150
you know,
which they clearly were in one way,

1768
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:46,360
but there were also sell fucking vance 
with rocketry.

1769
01:32:46,361 --> 01:32:51,361
And with science and you know,
I mean somebody companies came out of 

1770
01:32:51,361 --> 01:32:51,361
Nazi Germany,
you know,

1771
01:32:51,361 --> 01:32:54,140
there's just Germany period for getting 
the Nazi matter.

1772
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:55,170
So,
I mean,

1773
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,750
the Porsche started there,
you know,

1774
01:32:56,890 --> 01:32:58,300
bmw,
some,

1775
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:03,320
somebody,
sophisticated engineers there were so 

1776
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:03,320
advanced.
What the fuck was there?

1777
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:07,551
A big thing about Ufo is where was the 
whole Nazi ufo connection because that 

1778
01:33:07,551 --> 01:33:10,040
was one of the most fascinating ancient 
aliens to me.

1779
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,040
Yeah,
no,

1780
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:14,550
look,
I mean there's definitely something that

1781
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,370
can be said about this.
And uh,

1782
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:20,140
the whole idea because many scholars say
that,

1783
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,540
you know,
Hitler and the Nazis were never into the

1784
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:27,541
occult and that is simply untrue because
we have found or they found a documents 

1785
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:31,720
because they're,
the Nazis were immaculate.

1786
01:33:31,721 --> 01:33:34,410
The record keepers as we know,
and uh,

1787
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:39,420
it says that these expeditions to the 
North Pole to find openings at the North

1788
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:45,040
Pole and the South Pole,
that these expeditions truly did exist,

1789
01:33:45,041 --> 01:33:50,041
that the real society and the Tulip 
society really existed in things like 

1790
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:52,120
that.
And I personally find fascinating.

1791
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:57,120
But I gotta be honest with you.
You know that to me it's not ancient 

1792
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:02,011
enough.
Talk about Egos because that was 70 

1793
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:02,011
years ago.
My,

1794
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:04,370
my ancient aliens,
uh,

1795
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:09,600
you know,
some people consider a 70 year old 

1796
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:09,600
people,
ancient,

1797
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:09,600
but you know,
I don't.

1798
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,530
So uh,
my aliens happened thousands of years,

1799
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:16,540
so you a Sumerian Mesopotamia and Egypt,
ancient Greece and things like that,

1800
01:34:17,681 --> 01:34:19,870
but at the same time,
you know,

1801
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:25,760
you just never know.
And it would be foolish to not listen to

1802
01:34:25,931 --> 01:34:30,850
those stories or to look at these 
opinions because you just never know.

1803
01:34:30,851 --> 01:34:35,851
Just be open at all times.
Isn't there like a bunch of faces and 

1804
01:34:35,851 --> 01:34:39,901
paintings that have like old a drawing 
is an alien's on them and stuff like 

1805
01:34:39,901 --> 01:34:44,701
that.
And have those been disproven or have 

1806
01:34:44,701 --> 01:34:44,701
those,
uh,

1807
01:34:44,701 --> 01:34:44,701
are,
are the.

1808
01:34:44,701 --> 01:34:45,190
Because I've seen a few of them where 
they're like,

1809
01:34:45,191 --> 01:34:46,090
yeah,
this is an alien.

1810
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:46,500
I'm like,
yeah,

1811
01:34:46,501 --> 01:34:50,380
that or it's just a guy that has his 
head shaved and the artists sucks,

1812
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:55,420
you know,
if you've done in any research on that 

1813
01:34:55,901 --> 01:34:56,830
kind of stuff or.
No,

1814
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:59,450
I mean one of the greatest,
uh,

1815
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:02,240
quote unquote pieces of evidence we have
is,

1816
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,130
you know,
the,

1817
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:04,150
the deaf,
the,

1818
01:35:04,151 --> 01:35:07,640
um,
the carvings that we find,

1819
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:11,450
but also the figurines and drawings on 
vases,

1820
01:35:11,451 --> 01:35:16,451
like what you were saying and there 
really are compelling figurines and 

1821
01:35:17,901 --> 01:35:22,901
compelling drawings that compared to 
modern days are eerily similar to modern

1822
01:35:25,611 --> 01:35:30,611
day astronauts suits and you know,
a lot of times that the bunkers are 

1823
01:35:30,611 --> 01:35:30,611
like,
okay,

1824
01:35:30,611 --> 01:35:35,501
so you're suggesting that the aliens 
we're here and why on earth would they 

1825
01:35:35,901 --> 01:35:40,901
wear to same suits or why would they 
need suits like our modern day 

1826
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:41,810
astronauts because they were only a 
little more advanced us.

1827
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:42,980
Right?
Exactly.

1828
01:35:42,981 --> 01:35:45,560
But there were us in 100 years but we 
would need suits.

1829
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:46,460
Right?
But that.

1830
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:51,520
But that's the exact argument that if we
can't go to the moon without a suit,

1831
01:35:51,921 --> 01:35:54,410
so why would aliens if they're,
you know,

1832
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:57,850
have oxygen based to people as we are 
or,

1833
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:03,010
or,
or people that need to breathe oxygen 

1834
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:03,010
for,
for their life support.

1835
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:07,300
So to suggest that aliens are so vastly 
different than us that I have a hard 

1836
01:36:07,851 --> 01:36:08,600
time with that.
I mean,

1837
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:11,600
there's some people that have suggested 
that aliens are just these,

1838
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:13,270
you know,
uh,

1839
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:16,850
blobs of slime and I'm like,
okay,

1840
01:36:16,851 --> 01:36:18,500
that's possible.
But,

1841
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:23,830
you know,
that would define nature because nature 

1842
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:27,341
is very efficient and I think that the 
building blocks that are requirements 

1843
01:36:27,341 --> 01:36:31,400
for life are pretty much a given 
throughout the entire universe.

1844
01:36:31,730 --> 01:36:35,210
And so that if something happens here,
you know,

1845
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,520
to,
to think that aliens would exist,

1846
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:40,790
like in the Hollywood movies,
that's a bit too much for me.

1847
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:41,270
I mean,
look,

1848
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:46,280
it's great entertainment,
but do I think that that is how it is in

1849
01:36:46,281 --> 01:36:47,960
reality?
Not really.

1850
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:50,630
I think that we're all pretty much,
you know,

1851
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:52,390
the same out there,
um,

1852
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:54,170
you know,
more advanced obviously,

1853
01:36:54,171 --> 01:36:57,700
but it looks nice because all those 
ancient uh,

1854
01:36:57,710 --> 01:37:01,190
carvings or descriptions and paintings 
that we have,

1855
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:06,510
you know,
especially if you look at the ancient 

1856
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:06,510
Hindu gods,
they look like us.

1857
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:08,000
Beautiful.
But just with blue skin for example,

1858
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:11,090
but they weren't,
they didn't have four in India.

1859
01:37:11,091 --> 01:37:12,290
Yes,
they did have 20 arms,

1860
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:18,430
but you know,
so it's definitely something to be said 

1861
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:19,340
that,
you know,

1862
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:25,270
we think that we have depictions that 
show potential exit through restroom 

1863
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:28,520
visits,
visitors in the past.

1864
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:33,660
You must dominate some late night hippie
pussy sitting around with,

1865
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:38,830
you know what I'm saying,
sitting around smoking weed with some 

1866
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:40,550
chicks at a party and you drop some of 
this ancient alien knowledge dude,

1867
01:37:40,551 --> 01:37:43,040
you must just knock it out of the 
fucking park.

1868
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:47,450
Or should I say have in the past or 
should I say have the potential to.

1869
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:51,110
I don't say you use it for evil.
Never evil,

1870
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:56,170
never evil.
Do you believe in or what do you think 

1871
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:59,880
about the reptilian shape?
Shifting genre,

1872
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:02,820
complete nonsense.
The David acres.

1873
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:07,870
So many nonsense.
He's got so many good points but a 

1874
01:38:07,870 --> 01:38:12,041
little things.
But you mentioned Shane shapeshifting 

1875
01:38:12,041 --> 01:38:13,540
earlier this the possibility to turn 
into clouds are trees.

1876
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,670
Yeah,
but I.

1877
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:19,290
But I would not say that that's only 
reserved for reptilians.

1878
01:38:19,291 --> 01:38:19,680
I mean,
look,

1879
01:38:19,681 --> 01:38:23,400
I really think that.
I don't know.

1880
01:38:23,401 --> 01:38:27,660
I mean the whole argument with the whole
reptilian thing.

1881
01:38:27,661 --> 01:38:32,661
Look,
it really doesn't matter because what 

1882
01:38:32,661 --> 01:38:37,281
this theory or this whole extra 
terrestrial question is about is whether

1883
01:38:37,441 --> 01:38:41,760
or not extraterrestrial life not only 
has been here,

1884
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,840
but also whether they're here right now 
and you know what,

1885
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:51,200
whether their reptilian or if they look 
like link the Loompa's he doesn't 

1886
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,020
matter.

1887
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:57,350
The fact is that having an 
extraterrestrial presence on planet 

1888
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:58,080
earth,
not only today,

1889
01:38:58,081 --> 01:39:03,081
but for thousands of years,
that is sensational enough then to 

1890
01:39:03,081 --> 01:39:04,440
suggest,
yeah,

1891
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:09,830
you know,
they're coming from planet so and so 

1892
01:39:09,830 --> 01:39:11,400
their space ships name is so and so.
Their commander's name was so and so.

1893
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:12,390
I mean,
that is,

1894
01:39:12,391 --> 01:39:17,391
to me,
all irrelevant garbage and that is why 

1895
01:39:17,391 --> 01:39:20,900
the mainstream is not listening to these
stories because they're completely,

1896
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:24,930
it's complete buffoonery to suggest,
you know,

1897
01:39:24,931 --> 01:39:29,931
what plant they're from,
what their spaceships name was with the 

1898
01:39:29,931 --> 01:39:30,450
propulsion system was.
I mean,

1899
01:39:30,451 --> 01:39:35,451
it's all nonsense.
Who gives a shit extra terrestrials 

1900
01:39:35,451 --> 01:39:38,460
we're an art here.
That's all that should matter to you.

1901
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:39,600
That I'm sorry.
No,

1902
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:39,810
no,
no.

1903
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:42,010
Do you um,
believe Robert Loser?

1904
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,270
Do you believe his stories?
You know,

1905
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:45,790
I was just thinking about him.
Him and John Lear,

1906
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:48,810
John Lear's,
out of the craziest theories ever,

1907
01:39:48,811 --> 01:39:53,811
John Lear believes that there are 
millions of humanoids on every planet in

1908
01:39:55,591 --> 01:39:58,440
the solar system and we've been to all 
the planets.

1909
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:00,780
There's a CPA,
he's Kooky,

1910
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,910
crazy shit.
But,

1911
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:07,340
but Robert Lasar is not so cookie.
Robert Lazard is a,

1912
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:11,580
I think he's probably full of shit about
some things for sure.

1913
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:14,880
But he's also a very intelligent guy and
god damn,

1914
01:40:14,881 --> 01:40:19,881
he sounds confident as fuck when he 
gives you his depictions to pictures of 

1915
01:40:19,881 --> 01:40:20,760
what happened at area 51 and where he 
worked.

1916
01:40:20,761 --> 01:40:22,770
And you know,
it's interesting,

1917
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:24,420
you know,
uh,

1918
01:40:24,421 --> 01:40:26,310
I don't,
I don't know if he's telling the truth,

1919
01:40:26,311 --> 01:40:30,150
but from what I understand,
he lied about his education.

1920
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:32,040
He lied about where he went to school 
and they've,

1921
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:37,090
you know,
they've proven that he didn't get 

1922
01:40:37,090 --> 01:40:37,090
degrees where he said he got degrees.
So I dunno,

1923
01:40:37,090 --> 01:40:38,190
you know,
but again,

1924
01:40:38,690 --> 01:40:41,630
could be more disinflation,
could be more.

1925
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:43,080
He was really good friends with John 
later.

1926
01:40:43,081 --> 01:40:48,081
They were buddies.
And that's not good because that John 

1927
01:40:48,081 --> 01:40:52,520
Lear guys out to lunch,
or John Lear says that the moon is a 

1928
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:54,250
spaceship right now.
He says that that's where your soul goes

1929
01:40:54,251 --> 01:40:55,300
to.
It's a song catcher.

1930
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:57,420
When you die,
your soul goes to the moon.

1931
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:58,980
See,
that to me is nonsense.

1932
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:00,980
It's just right there and say,
okay,

1933
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:03,340
look,
never say never.

1934
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:10,810
But that right there,
you're going to lose the mainstream 

1935
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:10,810
audience.
And listen,

1936
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:11,700
that Guy John,
I'd say,

1937
01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:14,260
if anybody's a dis information guys,
John Lear,

1938
01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:19,290
lear jets,
guys worth fucking $50 million dollars 

1939
01:41:19,290 --> 01:41:19,390
is out there running around talking 
about the moon,

1940
01:41:19,391 --> 01:41:22,060
catching souls.
When you die,

1941
01:41:22,061 --> 01:41:23,170
you live in Ron.
Jeremy,

1942
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:28,680
tell us about some episodes that some 
subject or subjects that you guys are 

1943
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:32,051
going to cover that you didn't cover.
The first two things because he did the 

1944
01:41:32,051 --> 01:41:32,200
cowboy thing.
That's pretty good.

1945
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:32,790
Yeah,
no,

1946
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:37,800
but for example,
we're talking about the entire churches 

1947
01:41:38,231 --> 01:41:43,231
and buildings that were,
that are carved into the ground in 

1948
01:41:43,231 --> 01:41:47,041
Ethiopia at zoom and Baylor were 
apparently a a version or possibly the 

1949
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:55,170
Ark of the covenant is still buried in a
town called act soon.

1950
01:41:56,170 --> 01:42:01,170
Now that's what got Graham Hancock into 
his whole journey that he went on.

1951
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:06,870
He wouldn't say mainstream reporter,
and he was covering some political 

1952
01:42:07,061 --> 01:42:10,300
unrest in Ethiopia and he started 
talking to some of the people that guard

1953
01:42:10,301 --> 01:42:13,450
the temple that where they say the Ark 
of the covenant is inside.

1954
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:15,430
And uh,
he,

1955
01:42:15,431 --> 01:42:20,431
uh,
was very compelled by the evidence and 

1956
01:42:20,431 --> 01:42:20,530
the history behind it.
And what do you think about it?

1957
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:21,790
Well,
for example,

1958
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:26,791
I mean every week they have a procession
through the town where they carry a 

1959
01:42:26,791 --> 01:42:29,650
replica of the Ark around and uh,
it's obviously a replica.

1960
01:42:29,651 --> 01:42:31,580
Unfortunately,
you,

1961
01:42:31,910 --> 01:42:36,910
nobody has access to the arc except for 
this family,

1962
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:42,150
for who,
for generations have been guarding this 

1963
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:45,270
arc.
And what's really fascinating is that 

1964
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:47,950
each and every guardian of that arc,
they eventually go blind,

1965
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:51,160
which is really fascinating to think 
that,

1966
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:56,220
you know,
you're guarding this object that only 

1967
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:58,831
you are allowed to see if at all.
And each and every one of these guards 

1968
01:42:58,870 --> 01:43:00,500
has gone blind.
Many,

1969
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:01,600
how many you,
oh,

1970
01:43:01,601 --> 01:43:06,601
we're talking at least 350 years.
Record it of people go on blind faith 

1971
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:07,930
that I go,
bitch,

1972
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:08,980
you could have that job.

1973
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:14,010
Well,
they may not have lava and you get this 

1974
01:43:14,010 --> 01:43:17,931
arc of the covenant.
Why is it so awesome that it's willing 

1975
01:43:17,931 --> 01:43:18,340
to make you go blind?
And that is the exact question.

1976
01:43:18,341 --> 01:43:23,341
I mean,
so something is going on there unless 

1977
01:43:23,341 --> 01:43:23,341
it's a hoax.
And,

1978
01:43:23,341 --> 01:43:25,900
and the stories have been made up to 
think that man who,

1979
01:43:25,901 --> 01:43:30,901
uh,
told Graham Hancock about it had 

1980
01:43:30,901 --> 01:43:30,901
cataracts,
you know,

1981
01:43:30,901 --> 01:43:33,871
that was the,
one of the things that led him to start 

1982
01:43:33,871 --> 01:43:36,241
investigating.
But I have heard that too many of the 

1983
01:43:36,241 --> 01:43:36,760
people that have been in the care of 
this thing had been blocked.

1984
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:42,030
So what do they think?
They think that it's radioactive and 

1985
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:42,640
some sort of a way possibly,
possibly.

1986
01:43:42,641 --> 01:43:44,710
I mean,
according to what is it supposed to be?

1987
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:50,170
Well,
according to the ancient astronauts 

1988
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:52,591
theory that I represent,
the Ark of the was nothing else but a 

1989
01:43:53,241 --> 01:43:58,241
container in which an extra terrestrial 
food dispensing device was stored in 

1990
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,010
food dispensing.

1991
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:06,020
Yes,
like an extra terrestrial vending 

1992
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:06,020
machine.
Exactly.

1993
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:06,170
I like that.
I'm going to,

1994
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:08,270
I'm going to steal that from you.
I liked that very much.

1995
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:11,540
So the Ark of the covenant is nothing 
but a fucking vending machine,

1996
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:18,230
but it's a great time.
So that basically,

1997
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:22,310
how did you come to that conclusion?
Look in the 19 seventies,

1998
01:44:22,311 --> 01:44:27,311
these two engineers then of Rodney Dale 
and George says they wrote a book called

1999
01:44:29,061 --> 01:44:31,430
the man and machine and if you look at 
Mana,

2000
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:32,650
Mana,
meaning the,

2001
01:44:32,651 --> 01:44:33,110
the,
the,

2002
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:36,950
the breadth of that fell from heaven.
Exactly.

2003
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:42,790
And uh,
they ancient astronaut people and the 

2004
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:45,581
mushroom people need to get together,
come up with a unified theory of crazy 

2005
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:48,430
because that's what they believe.
Monetize.

2006
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,800
I'm sorry.
No,

2007
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:51,740
don't worry.
So there is a,

2008
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:52,420
uh,
uh,

2009
01:44:52,990 --> 01:44:56,690
in the Hebrew Zahar than there is a.
sorry.

2010
01:44:56,691 --> 01:44:57,230
In,
in the,

2011
01:44:57,231 --> 01:44:58,490
um,
in the Kabbalah,

2012
01:44:58,491 --> 01:45:02,090
there a text in the Kabbalah called 
Zahar.

2013
01:45:02,470 --> 01:45:07,470
And the so hard describes a,
an ancient of days that the traveled 

2014
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:13,540
with a 40 year wanderings through the 
desert at this ancient of days was with 

2015
01:45:14,091 --> 01:45:19,091
them all the time.
At the ancient of days has been 

2016
01:45:19,091 --> 01:45:19,160
interpreted,
interpret as the Old Testament God.

2017
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:24,380
And so these two engineers came along 
and theoretic description of it and they

2018
01:45:24,381 --> 01:45:25,100
said,
you know what,

2019
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:30,130
this does not sound like a dad at all,
but it sounds like some type of a 

2020
01:45:30,130 --> 01:45:31,430
machine.
Now mind you,

2021
01:45:31,431 --> 01:45:34,580
those guys were engineers,
electrical engineers,

2022
01:45:34,581 --> 01:45:37,910
so they weren't some hobbyists or 
something like this.

2023
01:45:37,911 --> 01:45:40,310
And one guy was also a linguist at the 
same time.

2024
01:45:40,311 --> 01:45:43,920
So they looked at all these translations
and look at all the,

2025
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:46,700
uh,
the different interpretations.

2026
01:45:46,701 --> 01:45:51,701
And they found that some of the earliest
translations of the ancient of days 

2027
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:56,630
wasn't in fact the ancient of days.
But the transportable,

2028
01:45:56,631 --> 01:46:01,631
one of the tanks now that is very 
bizarre that you have this thing that 

2029
01:46:02,751 --> 01:46:07,751
had to be disassembled and assembled 
every week on different,

2030
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:08,740
uh,
on,

2031
01:46:08,741 --> 01:46:13,741
on,
after a certain amount of time where 

2032
01:46:13,741 --> 01:46:17,351
this machine or this object was taken 
apart with different parts that were 

2033
01:46:17,351 --> 01:46:18,590
connected with cubes.

2034
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:23,770
And there was a huge light source.
And it was just this magnificent thing 

2035
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:28,930
that they determined,
dispensed the Mana through big giant 

2036
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:33,110
tanks.
And also through tubes.

2037
01:46:33,111 --> 01:46:35,180
And things like this,
um,

2038
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:36,220
that,
uh,

2039
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:41,550
you know,
that is the reason why we have to the 

2040
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:41,810
Sabbath today because on the sabbath the
machine had to be cleaned.

2041
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:47,110
So all those differently.
This is wild stuff,

2042
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:53,110
wild and crazy stuff,
but at the same time it's very 

2043
01:46:53,110 --> 01:46:58,041
compelling because the texts are exactly
saying that that on Friday and Saturday 

2044
01:46:58,041 --> 01:47:02,780
you're not going to get fed because this
quarter and called dad had to be taken 

2045
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:07,461
apart and cleaned and it wasn't 
extremely meticulous and dangerous 

2046
01:47:07,501 --> 01:47:09,440
process.
People died.

2047
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:15,050
People who did not know how to operate 
or how to conduct themselves in the 

2048
01:47:16,291 --> 01:47:18,810
presence of this transportable off the 
tanks.

2049
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:23,460
They dropped to the floor dead and then 
they would lose their fingernails.

2050
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:28,290
They would have a minute ago,
you broke my crazy meter.

2051
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:31,310
Broken.
My Shit's broken night.

2052
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:32,800
It don't work anymore.
Good.

2053
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:36,100
I don't know what you're saying anymore.
I don't even know what you're saying.

2054
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:39,660
My job.
I have done my job.

2055
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:44,670
Try to throw your shit in my brain what 
you were saying about this machine and 

2056
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:44,670
then my,
my,

2057
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:45,330
my,
my brain's going,

2058
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:50,540
what the fuck are you asking me?
Do you think it's possible that there 

2059
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:52,680
was like this ancient machine that 
killed everybody?

2060
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:54,900
Why would they do that?
Was there a shortage of fully back then?

2061
01:47:54,901 --> 01:47:59,210
Could they just go get food?
Maybe the food.

2062
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:04,220
They had awesome food.
It took an ice cream truck back in the 

2063
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:07,371
time machine.
People would freak the shit with an ice 

2064
01:48:08,161 --> 01:48:11,980
cream cone.
The pushy that you would get initially,

2065
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:17,620
there are ancient stories where they 
talk about magical glowing tablets that 

2066
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:18,690
contained the universe.

2067
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:22,450
The universal knowledge was to take.
If you take that,

2068
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:24,960
those were iphones back to the,
you know,

2069
01:48:24,961 --> 01:48:25,980
10,000
years ago,

2070
01:48:25,981 --> 01:48:27,780
you have a magical tablet all of a 
sudden.

2071
01:48:27,781 --> 01:48:28,680
Yeah.
It is true.

2072
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:30,090
Yeah.
Well,

2073
01:48:30,091 --> 01:48:31,020
you know,
like I said,

2074
01:48:31,021 --> 01:48:36,021
I believe that there's some shit that 
human beings have discovered a long 

2075
01:48:36,021 --> 01:48:39,650
fucking time ago and then rediscovered 
it if human beings created the pyramids 

2076
01:48:39,650 --> 01:48:40,320
and that is the general consensus.
Right,

2077
01:48:40,530 --> 01:48:43,020
and I agree with that.
Definitely human beings,

2078
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:48,090
but with the assistance of exit 
terrestrial technology,

2079
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,580
because that is what ancient texts,
for example,

2080
01:48:50,581 --> 01:48:53,370
the all had taught,
Kita are saying,

2081
01:48:53,371 --> 01:48:56,850
written by the Egyptian historian on the
Chrissy,

2082
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:00,750
that the pyramids were built by 
[inaudible],

2083
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:05,810
which was a king and his people with the
assistance of the guardians of the sky.

2084
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,580
And in our interpretation,
of course,

2085
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:13,880
the guardians of the sky.
We're advanced flesh and blood could 

2086
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:17,540
terrestrials who taught mankind how to 
use certain machinery Yo [inaudible] 

2087
01:49:18,890 --> 01:49:23,890
Zachariah such and believed that the 
pyramids were never tunes that were 

2088
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:28,551
never built as soon as he,
he believes that they were beacons for 

2089
01:49:28,551 --> 01:49:29,180
the is.

2090
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:30,120
Yes.
I mean,

2091
01:49:30,121 --> 01:49:32,760
that is definitely a possibility 
personally.

2092
01:49:32,761 --> 01:49:33,240
Uh,
I,

2093
01:49:33,241 --> 01:49:38,241
I agree with the notion that the 
pyramids were never tombs because,

2094
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:43,940
uh,
even when the first time that the 

2095
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:45,930
pyramids were allegedly the seals were 
broken,

2096
01:49:46,510 --> 01:49:47,350
uh,
no,

2097
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:52,380
no actual bodies were found in there.
And what's really fascinating is the 

2098
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:52,450
fact that,
you know,

2099
01:49:52,451 --> 01:49:57,451
the pyramids defied every single other 
co structure in Egypt because you walk 

2100
01:49:58,811 --> 01:50:03,811
inside any tomb in Egypt and there the 
walls are filled with hieroglyphics.

2101
01:50:04,571 --> 01:50:05,710
And,
and really,

2102
01:50:05,711 --> 01:50:10,711
I mean it says exactly when it was built
by whom and how and when and what and 

2103
01:50:11,201 --> 01:50:16,201
where,
and you go inside the pyramids and 

2104
01:50:16,201 --> 01:50:16,630
they're completely anonymous except for 
a couple of cartoons.

2105
01:50:16,830 --> 01:50:21,830
That debate is still out whether or not 
these cartoon shows are in fact before 

2106
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:25,500
juries were not,
so that that mystery has not yet been 

2107
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:30,151
solved.
And despite what mainstream 

2108
01:50:30,151 --> 01:50:30,880
archaeologists saying when they've dated
the Great Pyramid,

2109
01:50:30,881 --> 01:50:32,740
back to 2,500
BC,

2110
01:50:32,741 --> 01:50:34,330
what have they used to data?

2111
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:36,250
What is the.
Oh,

2112
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:37,420
they,
they basically,

2113
01:50:37,421 --> 01:50:38,530
um,
see that?

2114
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:41,140
I know.
I love that you just asked that question

2115
01:50:41,141 --> 01:50:46,141
because the great misunderstanding is 
that when there's a lot of people that 

2116
01:50:48,491 --> 01:50:49,000
say,
you know,

2117
01:50:49,001 --> 01:50:52,720
when they dated the Sphinx or when they 
dated the pyramid and when they,

2118
01:50:53,290 --> 01:50:58,290
and right there you can,
you need to take a step back because 

2119
01:50:58,290 --> 01:51:01,770
nobody was actually able to do that 
because you can't really date stone 

2120
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:05,350
because the stone is an inorganic 
material.

2121
01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:11,150
If you carbon date something with this,
what they call the c 14 or carbon 14 

2122
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:12,610
method.
With dating,

2123
01:51:12,611 --> 01:51:17,611
you can only date something that's of a 
living material like bones or coal or 

2124
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:23,490
textiles and things like that because 
what they do is they measure the half 

2125
01:51:23,490 --> 01:51:28,341
life period of radioactive isotopes and 
so that's how you can accurately date,

2126
01:51:30,641 --> 01:51:31,810
for example,
a,

2127
01:51:31,811 --> 01:51:32,880
um,
you know,

2128
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:37,890
an old fire pit that has been found and 
many times archeologists are dating a 

2129
01:51:37,890 --> 01:51:42,721
firepit and then they come up with a 
particular lady yields that the test 

2130
01:51:42,721 --> 01:51:44,770
yields a particular date,
let's say,

2131
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:45,580
uh,
you know,

2132
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:48,340
500 BC and then they say,
well,

2133
01:51:48,341 --> 01:51:53,341
okay,
that means that the site itself also 

2134
01:51:53,341 --> 01:51:53,650
dates from 500 BC.

2135
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:58,890
And that,
in my opinion is a logical fallacy 

2136
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:01,980
because just because a firepit bates to 
500 BC doesn't mean that was also built 

2137
01:52:05,381 --> 01:52:07,570
in 500 BC.
They can't date stones.

2138
01:52:07,571 --> 01:52:08,410
Right,
exactly.

2139
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:11,180
So how do they do good Beckley Tepi,
how do they say that?

2140
01:52:11,181 --> 01:52:13,080
That thing is 12,000
years old with,

2141
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:18,140
with,
with the fire pits and the bones that 

2142
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:19,530
were found in and around that area.
So it's still absolutely so,

2143
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:23,620
which means that the stones themselves 
could date back even further.

2144
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:25,900
It would be way newer APP.
Yes,

2145
01:52:25,901 --> 01:52:27,840
of course.
Look Weird.

2146
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:30,490
Are they using go Beckley Teppei though 
for folks I don't know.

2147
01:52:30,491 --> 01:52:35,491
It's right now considered to be the 
oldest structure ever discovered and 

2148
01:52:35,491 --> 01:52:38,440
they're saying that it's 6,000
years before Mesopotamian Sumir,

2149
01:52:38,441 --> 01:52:41,680
which was previously considered to be 
the cradle of civilization,

2150
01:52:41,681 --> 01:52:46,681
the oldest.
And they're saying that this was all 

2151
01:52:46,681 --> 01:52:46,681
constructed,
but I can people were hunter gatherers,

2152
01:52:46,681 --> 01:52:49,190
but if that is what they're saying,
I mean how can you say that if it's just

2153
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:52,160
like fire pit shit and bones and 
whatever.

2154
01:52:52,420 --> 01:52:54,200
Right.
The thing is also that,

2155
01:52:54,201 --> 01:52:59,201
you know on,
on the little Mediterranean island in 

2156
01:52:59,201 --> 01:52:59,201
Malta,
which is right next to Sicily,

2157
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:04,600
there are megalithic structures.
Megalithic meaning gigantic stones that 

2158
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:04,900
are,
you know,

2159
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:09,940
250 500 metric tons heavy slabs that 
have been transported from somewhere 

2160
01:53:11,001 --> 01:53:13,820
else put into place with incredible 
precision.

2161
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:19,310
And some of these have data to 12,000
BC when allegedly we were just,

2162
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:22,100
you know,
munching on bananas and how do they date

2163
01:53:22,101 --> 01:53:23,370
these to 12,000
BC?

2164
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:28,420
What are they also again with,
with bones and with having found fire 

2165
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:32,861
pits.
But that does not mean that the stones 

2166
01:53:32,861 --> 01:53:32,861
themselves have been placed there even 
earlier.

2167
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,740
There is a,
uh,

2168
01:53:35,330 --> 01:53:40,010
a method out there called,
called the thermo luminescent,

2169
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:43,530
a dating method of stone where,
uh,

2170
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:48,730
you can conceivably date stone bites.
It's a bit inaccurate because what 

2171
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:52,121
happens is if you Polish or cut a stone,
the oxygen in the air,

2172
01:53:53,691 --> 01:53:58,691
there's a chemical reaction that takes 
place with the surface of that stone and

2173
01:53:59,790 --> 01:54:02,820
they can somehow somehow measure this 
has been cut.

2174
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:04,060
Exactly.
And,

2175
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:08,510
but it's a very expensive way of testing
something.

2176
01:54:08,511 --> 01:54:11,300
So in many universities unfortunately 
don't have the money.

2177
01:54:11,301 --> 01:54:16,301
So they don't do that.
The third way is we're each time that 

2178
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:22,390
you have an ancient stone overtime,
because we were talking before about 

2179
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:25,790
erosion and if you have thousands of 
years of rainfall,

2180
01:54:25,791 --> 01:54:27,980
what is left over?
You gave the answer,

2181
01:54:27,981 --> 01:54:31,130
you said rocks.
And that is exactly right.

2182
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:35,840
So over time,
what forms over a rock is this thin film

2183
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:38,030
that just built,
it's called a Patina.

2184
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:43,390
And the thicker this film or this Patina
is the older the stone.

2185
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:49,840
So people have in fact been able to 
measure the Patina and people have 

2186
01:54:50,421 --> 01:54:55,421
determined that some of these cuts are 
thousands and thousands of years old,

2187
01:54:56,180 --> 01:55:01,180
meaning they're not modern day creations
and right there it just boggles the mind

2188
01:55:02,091 --> 01:55:05,150
because it was certainly not cut with 
blondes.

2189
01:55:05,151 --> 01:55:06,800
Tools are with chicken bones.

2190
01:55:07,010 --> 01:55:09,920
As we were led to believe.
If you had the opportunity right now,

2191
01:55:09,921 --> 01:55:14,921
if the government came and they picked 
you up and air force one and flew to 

2192
01:55:14,921 --> 01:55:15,820
Washington and said,
listen to,

2193
01:55:16,090 --> 01:55:17,630
we're gonna,
we're gonna offer you something I didn't

2194
01:55:17,631 --> 01:55:20,090
know you know a lot about the shit we 
could use you.

2195
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:22,880
We're going to show you some shit and 
when you needed to help us.

2196
01:55:22,881 --> 01:55:26,810
But you can't tell anybody.
You've got to quit your all your ancient

2197
01:55:26,811 --> 01:55:29,300
alien stuff.
You've got to quit your magazine.

2198
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:31,550
You got to work for the government and 
tell no one.

2199
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:34,730
And they monitor your fucking calls.
If you telling anybody you're dead,

2200
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:39,970
but they're going to take an area 51 and
they're going to take you to Wright 

2201
01:55:39,970 --> 01:55:41,900
Patterson air force base to hang 18 and 
they're going to show you all that shit.

2202
01:55:41,901 --> 01:55:46,901
Would you be down?
They're going to show you the ancient 

2203
01:55:46,901 --> 01:55:46,901
show

2204
01:55:46,901 --> 01:55:46,901
you everything.
You know the answer.

2205
01:55:46,901 --> 01:55:48,890
Yes.
You would do it right?

2206
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:53,900
Yeah.
You'd give up on civilization and be a 

2207
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:53,900
suit.
Of course.

2208
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:53,900
I might be to.
I might do it two.

2209
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:54,560
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm,

2210
01:55:54,610 --> 01:55:59,610
I quit comedy.
Quit comedy to learn about the aliens 

2211
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:01,680
because it helped me,
you know,

2212
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:03,690
if you knew,
if you knew for a fact,

2213
01:56:04,370 --> 01:56:07,440
would it help?
Would we just sit around waiting for the

2214
01:56:07,441 --> 01:56:12,441
ambulance to come?
And then when they didn't want you be 

2215
01:56:12,441 --> 01:56:12,441
disappointed.
I mean,

2216
01:56:12,441 --> 01:56:12,920
if you do know that there are aliens out
there and they're monitoring you,

2217
01:56:12,930 --> 01:56:13,890
like,
come on,

2218
01:56:13,891 --> 01:56:15,190
make something happen.
Oh,

2219
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:20,220
here,
here's something I would like to put on 

2220
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:20,220
the record.

2221
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:21,090
Hear that personally,
I have never seen a Ufo.

2222
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:24,870
I have never been visited.
I have never had any,

2223
01:56:24,871 --> 01:56:25,560
uh,
you know,

2224
01:56:25,650 --> 01:56:28,440
an abduction experience or anything like
this.

2225
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:31,590
So because a lot of people asked me that
and then I tell them,

2226
01:56:31,591 --> 01:56:33,000
no,
actually I haven't been there like,

2227
01:56:33,001 --> 01:56:35,310
well then how do you subscribe to these 
ideas?

2228
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:36,990
And I'm like,
well,

2229
01:56:36,991 --> 01:56:39,690
because you know,
to me this has really nothing to do with

2230
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:44,310
belief because belief always has this 
quote unquote religious connotation.

2231
01:56:44,311 --> 01:56:47,610
It means that if you believe something,
you have to have faith.

2232
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:50,580
I don't have faith in aliens,
I don't worship them.

2233
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I don't quote unquote think of them as 
spiritual or divine beings.

2234
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:00,330
There are people like us just more 
advanced technologically speaking.

2235
01:57:00,331 --> 01:57:05,331
So to me it's more of an idea of,
of knowing instead of believing I think 

2236
01:57:07,381 --> 01:57:08,850
about these things.
It's not,

2237
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:10,720
you know,
that I quote unquote bullying.

2238
01:57:11,130 --> 01:57:13,790
So you think there's a broad spectrum of
aliens out there?

2239
01:57:13,791 --> 01:57:16,430
Like there's some of them that are just 
like a little more advanced than us.

2240
01:57:16,431 --> 01:57:20,260
Like they could visit us and maybe maybe
fuck us and gold.

2241
01:57:20,290 --> 01:57:25,290
Sure.
And there's other ones that are like 

2242
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:26,861
super advanced that are just showing up 
as clouds and monitoring us and 

2243
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:28,620
explosions.
Is

2244
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:33,620
this a thing out there where this guy,
Carter chef is Soviet scientist in the 

2245
01:57:33,620 --> 01:57:36,100
sixties and seventies actually came up 
with this,

2246
01:57:37,070 --> 01:57:41,340
the classification of civilizations,
and he said that there's basically three

2247
01:57:41,341 --> 01:57:44,010
types of civilizations out there,
type one,

2248
01:57:44,011 --> 01:57:45,090
type two,
type three,

2249
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:50,160
type one civilization is.
And it's all about energy because in the

2250
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:53,340
end that's all what it comes down to.
And uh,

2251
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:58,440
he basically suggested that a type one 
civilization is capable of harnessing 

2252
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:00,870
the energy resources of their own home 
planet.

2253
01:58:01,410 --> 01:58:06,410
A type two civilization is able to 
harness the energy resources of their 

2254
01:58:06,810 --> 01:58:10,860
solar system.
And a type three civilization is able to

2255
01:58:10,861 --> 01:58:13,830
harness the energy resources of their 
own galaxy.

2256
01:58:14,370 --> 01:58:19,370
Now we on this scale are were none.
We are type zero civilization on the 

2257
01:58:20,881 --> 01:58:23,910
verge of becoming a type one 
civilization.

2258
01:58:23,911 --> 01:58:28,200
So Sagan,
Carl Sagan actually suggested that we're

2259
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:33,260
maybe a point seven or possibly now a 
point eight and many of these 

2260
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:39,380
astronomers and astrophysicists are 
suggesting that this transitionary 

2261
01:58:39,901 --> 01:58:44,901
period from a type zero type one is the 
most difficult and most dangerous one 

2262
01:58:46,901 --> 01:58:51,901
because it does involve the splitting of
the atom or monkeys altogether.

2263
01:58:54,870 --> 01:58:56,980
And monkeys,
you know,

2264
01:58:56,981 --> 01:59:00,730
so I mean this is all,
it's all fascinating stuff.

2265
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:06,510
Brian Asleep one thing I was going to 
ask you about before when you studied,

2266
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:12,780
they found those little things,
they rebuild and upper propellers on 

2267
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:13,930
them and they were like a plane.
I saw the pictures of those,

2268
01:59:13,931 --> 01:59:16,420
but it also looks like they kind of 
modified the,

2269
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,240
uh,
the,

2270
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:20,600
the wings a little bit to make it 
actually fly a,

2271
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:23,750
what could it have been just easily like
a statue of a bird or,

2272
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:24,790
or,
or something like that.

2273
01:59:24,791 --> 01:59:29,791
Why is it all just they put routers,
it doesn't look like they modified the 

2274
01:59:29,791 --> 01:59:34,050
wings on a,
on the actual statute is just like a 

2275
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:34,050
flat,
you know,

2276
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:35,770
that has to be curved in order for it to
get flight,

2277
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:37,000
you know?
Yeah.

2278
01:59:37,001 --> 01:59:39,220
But the thing is that it actually,
um,

2279
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:40,070
in,
in,

2280
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:43,720
in the same collection of,
of um,

2281
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:47,230
the totems or robbed or found.

2282
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:52,680
They did find carvings or creations of 
birds and they look totally different.

2283
01:59:54,301 --> 01:59:59,301
Yes.
And fish and crocodiles and what he was 

2284
01:59:59,301 --> 02:00:02,641
talking about earlier too about the 
wings being on the bottom and the 

2285
02:00:02,641 --> 02:00:05,161
fuselage.
And all that shit is like the rudder on 

2286
02:00:05,161 --> 02:00:08,221
the top.
There's no animal in the history of the 

2287
02:00:08,221 --> 02:00:08,221
cars.
That fucking thing.

2288
02:00:08,221 --> 02:00:08,221
Right.
Um,

2289
02:00:08,221 --> 02:00:12,721
let me see some of those pictures you 
brought him in because he brought in 

2290
02:00:12,721 --> 02:00:14,500
some bad ass structures.
And this is a your own collection.

2291
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:15,820
Yeah.
This is stuff that I,

2292
02:00:15,821 --> 02:00:19,000
that I took a all around the world now,
for example,

2293
02:00:19,350 --> 02:00:24,350
you know,
because I was saying earlier that 

2294
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:26,670
obviously our ancestors did know how to 
cut stone and move objects and move 

2295
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:31,231
stone blocks and things like that.
So there's absolutely no question about 

2296
02:00:31,231 --> 02:00:31,930
that.
They did know how to do this,

2297
02:00:32,530 --> 02:00:37,530
but I'm going to show you a physical 
impossibility right now where I still 

2298
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:43,680
today,
I show these pictures at each and every 

2299
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:46,690
one of my lectures and I have yet anyone
to come forward and tell me how this was

2300
02:00:46,691 --> 02:00:47,020
done.

2301
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:52,380
And I've taught,
I've shown these pictures to engineers 

2302
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:52,390
to stone cutters and things like that.
And if they're like,

2303
02:00:52,391 --> 02:00:54,490
this can't be done.
So if you look,

2304
02:00:54,491 --> 02:00:59,491
for example,
at this structure right here,

2305
02:00:59,830 --> 02:01:04,830
obviously it's a type of a stone quarry.
We're blocks were cut out so you know,

2306
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:12,300
there's no question that stone blocks 
where were actually cut out of these 

2307
02:01:13,150 --> 02:01:15,910
particular sections.
Right?

2308
02:01:15,950 --> 02:01:18,640
Right there.
However,

2309
02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:22,210
if you,
and this year is on the back entrance in

2310
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:27,870
Peru in an area called a orientate 
tombow and uh,

2311
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:33,420
what you have here is a two blocks that 
were cut out of the side of the 

2312
02:01:34,811 --> 02:01:39,811
mountain,
one at the very top where if you look 

2313
02:01:39,811 --> 02:01:39,811
closely at the,
uh,

2314
02:01:39,811 --> 02:01:42,590
at this particular photograph,
the top one,

2315
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:47,120
the top block or the top slab was 
released by,

2316
02:01:47,370 --> 02:01:52,370
you know,
having three cards on the left and the 

2317
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:52,370
right in the bottom.

2318
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:52,550
And then one blade that went down on the
back.

2319
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:57,770
But now I want you to pay attention to 
the bottom square of this particular,

2320
02:01:58,090 --> 02:02:03,090
um,
slap it was cut out where you can see 

2321
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:05,660
the four sites have been cut out and 
then the back.

2322
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:09,740
But there is no access point to this 
particular,

2323
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:11,600
uh,
to the back.

2324
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:16,660
Because if you look closely the bridge 
that connects or that is between the top

2325
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:20,690
part or the top slab that was cut out.
And the bottom one,

2326
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:25,010
there is no access point,
it's a solid piece.

2327
02:02:25,490 --> 02:02:27,390
And so I see what you're saying.
Right?

2328
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:32,150
So what you're saying is that the top 
one you could slide behind it and cut it

2329
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:34,160
out because you could get at the top of 
it.

2330
02:02:34,530 --> 02:02:39,530
This one,
there's like a bridge and as no way to 

2331
02:02:39,530 --> 02:02:42,791
get behind it and write it up.
And as if somebody wants to have a good 

2332
02:02:42,791 --> 02:02:46,631
time,
the actual block that fit into the 

2333
02:02:46,631 --> 02:02:49,841
bottom slot is sitting right next to it,
as we say.

2334
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:51,890
Maybe they just destroyed it.
No,

2335
02:02:52,010 --> 02:02:52,340
no,
no,

2336
02:02:52,350 --> 02:02:52,570
no,
no,

2337
02:02:52,571 --> 02:02:54,560
no.
You could see it and hear it is cut out.

2338
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:55,970
Check it out.
So,

2339
02:02:56,170 --> 02:03:00,590
and that piece right there,
that blog has not a single millimeter of

2340
02:03:00,591 --> 02:03:05,591
loss of material.
So it's not like a carved around it or 

2341
02:03:05,591 --> 02:03:07,430
something.
I mean this is a physical impossibility.

2342
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:10,620
And the only way that somebody,
uh,

2343
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:16,280
you know,
give an idea how this could have been 

2344
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:19,510
been possible is you have a piece of 
this is I really wish we had photos of 

2345
02:03:22,221 --> 02:03:23,960
this that we could show people.
I mean,

2346
02:03:23,961 --> 02:03:24,650
this is,
um,

2347
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:30,500
W can they look up,
we're going to look up on the 

2348
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:30,500
[inaudible].
This is really fascinating.

2349
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:34,000
What is the name of this stone and what 
could they look up online if they want 

2350
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
to do with this yet broke?
How many people are looking at this at a

2351
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:35,680
fraction?

2352
02:03:37,050 --> 02:03:39,030
I can send you,
I can send you the,

2353
02:03:39,090 --> 02:03:40,980
what should,
what should they look for this?

2354
02:03:41,090 --> 02:03:46,090
This,
this is we untaped tombow o l l a n t a 

2355
02:03:47,211 --> 02:03:50,410
y t a,
b Oriente.

2356
02:03:50,450 --> 02:03:55,450
Tom Is in Peru in Peru.
And it's a in the backs in the quarry of

2357
02:03:57,300 --> 02:03:59,750
that archaeological site.
It's fucking incredible.

2358
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:03,560
Now I got a question.
What would the fuck is up with Peru?

2359
02:04:03,561 --> 02:04:08,561
Man,
there's so much crazy shit in Peru with 

2360
02:04:08,561 --> 02:04:08,561
the Nasco lines,
Machu Picchu,

2361
02:04:08,561 --> 02:04:09,070
those crazy people,
the skulls with a,

2362
02:04:09,071 --> 02:04:14,071
uh,
the deformed their skulls and make 

2363
02:04:14,071 --> 02:04:14,071
themselves look like fucking the 
coneheads,

2364
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:18,590
the Eland,
gator craniums is a cone.

2365
02:04:18,591 --> 02:04:21,530
Heads is definitely at a,
below the same error.

2366
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:24,800
Is it all combined?
Yes and no.

2367
02:04:24,830 --> 02:04:26,360
I mean,
look,

2368
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:31,810
one thing that's really great in my 
opinion is that the archeologists agree 

2369
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:37,000
that in Peru has the culture to the 
culture,

2370
02:04:37,070 --> 02:04:39,120
the ancient culture of Peru,
the Incas,

2371
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:42,540
and what's fascinating is the fact that 
today,

2372
02:04:42,541 --> 02:04:47,541
the archeologists agree that a pre inca 
civilization did in fact exist,

2373
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:55,370
but not a single archeologist agrees who
the hell those pre inca people were.

2374
02:04:58,620 --> 02:05:03,620
So this is where you know,
your previous idea in theory definitely 

2375
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:08,151
comes into place or fits,
that there was a type of highly advanced

2376
02:05:08,551 --> 02:05:13,551
civilization back in the past that 
nobody knows even know what date and 

2377
02:05:13,551 --> 02:05:15,300
some have suggested 10,
15,000

2378
02:05:15,301 --> 02:05:20,301
years ago that that civilization might 
have been wiped out because Puma Plinko 

2379
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:27,380
for example,
is such an era of such a region or a 

2380
02:05:27,380 --> 02:05:29,970
site that was 100 percent built by pre 
buy,

2381
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:35,030
buy a pri inconsideration and still 
today archeologists are fighting over 

2382
02:05:35,461 --> 02:05:38,010
who these people were.
We had a buddy on the other day,

2383
02:05:38,070 --> 02:05:43,070
Thompson had been demonstrably feature 
several times and I was saying that I 

2384
02:05:43,070 --> 02:05:46,581
had read something,
I believe it was Graham Hancock 

2385
02:05:46,581 --> 02:05:48,981
speculation about launch Picchu.
That at one point in time it was at the 

2386
02:05:48,981 --> 02:05:50,130
side of water isn't not true.
Puma,

2387
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:50,750
Puma,
Puma.

2388
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:51,520
What?
It wasn't,

2389
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:52,220
wasn't much a pitcher.

2390
02:05:52,230 --> 02:05:54,520
In fact Puma.
Puma is translated.

2391
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:56,340
It's but it's miles away from water 
right now,

2392
02:05:56,341 --> 02:05:57,060
right?
Yes,

2393
02:05:57,180 --> 02:05:58,640
yes.
But it's right next to.

2394
02:05:58,660 --> 02:06:03,660
It's right next to Lake Titicaca,
which is the highest navigable lake in 

2395
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:08,211
the world at 12 and a half thousand feet
and still today,

2396
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:10,350
the,
the train,

2397
02:06:10,410 --> 02:06:15,410
the train,
the train tracks that drive or to go 

2398
02:06:15,410 --> 02:06:19,011
through with the Bolivian highlands and 
the proven highlands are filled with 

2399
02:06:19,011 --> 02:06:23,840
muscles and with fish bones that are 
thousands and thousands of years old 

2400
02:06:24,150 --> 02:06:28,800
proving that that area used to be under 
seawater.

2401
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:30,260
We're not talking,
we're not.

2402
02:06:30,261 --> 02:06:31,530
Yeah,
we're not talking,

2403
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:32,550
you know,
fresh water.

2404
02:06:32,551 --> 02:06:35,070
We're talking seawater.
So I mean,

2405
02:06:35,490 --> 02:06:38,730
so people were punk who was built as an 
ocean port.

2406
02:06:38,820 --> 02:06:43,820
Yes.
And that is even something that 

2407
02:06:43,820 --> 02:06:44,820
mainstream archaeologists have proposed 
as well.

2408
02:06:44,850 --> 02:06:48,540
And how old is supposed to be then?
Well that would mean it goes back to the

2409
02:06:48,541 --> 02:06:49,410
last ice age.

2410
02:06:51,710 --> 02:06:53,790
Socially we're at 14,000
years ago.

2411
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:58,880
So all these Dasko lines and the top of 
the Nazca lines isn't there like clear 

2412
02:07:00,271 --> 02:07:04,200
evidence that area has been excavated by
machine.

2413
02:07:04,201 --> 02:07:09,201
I mean there are entire mountain tops at
Mrs are missing to have been as if with 

2414
02:07:09,661 --> 02:07:12,320
a cheese knife.
But I know that it was higher.

2415
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:13,410
I mean what is the proof?
Well,

2416
02:07:13,411 --> 02:07:17,670
because you have a mountain ranges right
next door,

2417
02:07:17,671 --> 02:07:22,671
not even 100 yards away or 200 yards 
away or a certain height of a certain 

2418
02:07:22,671 --> 02:07:24,810
height and you know,
and,

2419
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:29,870
and the other ones are completely like,
they're like table top level is level 

2420
02:07:30,151 --> 02:07:32,790
100 percent real affection.
Do you play pool on it?

2421
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,000
Absolutely.
Really should go play some NASCAR,

2422
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:41,040
Nascar Pool right now.
What is the mainstream opinion of what 

2423
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:42,610
those lines are?
Ford's very clear.

2424
02:07:42,611 --> 02:07:47,611
You could only see them from the sky if 
they are just artwork their artwork for 

2425
02:07:47,611 --> 02:07:49,750
fucking who fucking exactly how big are 
they?

2426
02:07:50,070 --> 02:07:51,910
They are,
there is.

2427
02:07:52,150 --> 02:07:57,150
Nazca is fascinating because you have a 
world famous geoglyphs and mainly you 

2428
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:00,760
people see the,
the,

2429
02:08:00,761 --> 02:08:05,761
uh,
the images of the spider and the monkey 

2430
02:08:05,761 --> 02:08:05,761
astronaut astronaut,
by the way,

2431
02:08:05,761 --> 02:08:08,890
the astronaut who looks like eat with 
the big eyes,

2432
02:08:08,980 --> 02:08:13,980
one hand is pointing to the sky,
the other hand is pointing to is both 

2433
02:08:14,350 --> 02:08:18,130
suck my dick.
That's sort of space with his dick.

2434
02:08:18,570 --> 02:08:19,720
Um,
and so,

2435
02:08:19,721 --> 02:08:20,440
uh,
you know,

2436
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:25,680
but at the same time you have those 
lines that look like landing trips that 

2437
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:28,030
look like landing strips.
And by the way,

2438
02:08:28,031 --> 02:08:31,840
we never suggest that that they actually
were landing strips because the argument

2439
02:08:31,841 --> 02:08:36,841
is completely ridiculous because what 
extraterrestrials traveled millions and 

2440
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:41,280
billions of light years plan before they
can land is to get a build airstrips.

2441
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:42,520
It makes no sense.
So now,

2442
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:46,270
so for the debunkers to even say that 
they're nuts,

2443
02:08:46,330 --> 02:08:47,680
what do you think those lines are then?

2444
02:08:47,980 --> 02:08:50,950
Those long straight lines,
they look like,

2445
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:52,570
you know,
it looks like an airport.

2446
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:56,890
There's absolutely no doubt in that that
it looks like an airport.

2447
02:08:56,891 --> 02:08:58,630
But.
So for example,

2448
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:02,080
look right now we've got a rover on Mars
that's,

2449
02:09:02,081 --> 02:09:07,081
you know,
driving around and it's leaving behind 

2450
02:09:07,081 --> 02:09:09,320
these tracks.
So we're suggesting that at some point a

2451
02:09:09,321 --> 02:09:14,321
long time ago,
some type of an unmanned or possibly 

2452
02:09:14,321 --> 02:09:17,581
even manned craft landed at Nassco for 
to conduct a core drills and core 

2453
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:23,200
samples of the ground to determine 
what's in that area because still today,

2454
02:09:23,201 --> 02:09:25,510
NASA is a bunch of drilled holes,
right?

2455
02:09:25,570 --> 02:09:28,220
Yes.
And there are you.

2456
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:33,250
And there's still mining going on today 
at Nasa because it's very abundant in a 

2457
02:09:34,150 --> 02:09:39,150
very precious raw materials on earth.
So if you want to know about planet 

2458
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:44,160
earth,
you can go to NASA and by conducting a 

2459
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:47,730
few days of research you,
it's like the cliff notes of planet 

2460
02:09:47,730 --> 02:09:47,730
Earth essentially.

2461
02:09:47,730 --> 02:09:52,500
And so imagine if you had a bunch of 
natives there and all of a sudden this 

2462
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:54,610
thing lands that conducts a bunch of 
research there,

2463
02:09:54,611 --> 02:09:56,770
of course,
afraid they run away.

2464
02:09:57,070 --> 02:09:58,040
And then this,
uh,

2465
02:09:58,130 --> 02:10:03,130
this craft leaves again and it leaves,
it has left behind some tracks in the 

2466
02:10:03,130 --> 02:10:08,041
sand or on the ground.
And then they come back out and they 

2467
02:10:08,041 --> 02:10:08,041
look at this stuff and they're like,
oh my God,

2468
02:10:08,041 --> 02:10:12,961
what just happened here?
I think we were just visited by God 

2469
02:10:12,961 --> 02:10:15,940
doesn't create these funerary objects 
that are 1000,

2470
02:10:15,941 --> 02:10:20,941
500 years old.
It looked like planes that are from 

2471
02:10:20,941 --> 02:10:20,941
central and South America.
Doesn't it make more sense that they had

2472
02:10:20,941 --> 02:10:23,320
planes that someone had planes back 
then?

2473
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:24,070
Well,
yes,

2474
02:10:24,130 --> 02:10:29,130
of course.
I mean that is the suggestion that the 

2475
02:10:29,130 --> 02:10:31,730
runways.
And that's what this whole multi Nazca 

2476
02:10:31,730 --> 02:10:33,070
lines thing maybe it really isn't an 
airport.

2477
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:35,660
Look,
I'm always,

2478
02:10:35,870 --> 02:10:37,880
I'm always one to say,
never say never.

2479
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:41,630
So I don't care.
Yeah,

2480
02:10:41,631 --> 02:10:44,030
exactly.
Flush and loved ones at that.

2481
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:45,430
No,
but the thing is that,

2482
02:10:45,431 --> 02:10:48,530
you know,
the bottom line is that at Nassco,

2483
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:52,520
what's really odd is that we have done 
some research there were we found,

2484
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:57,950
you know,
higher levels of arsenic in areas where 

2485
02:10:57,950 --> 02:11:00,461
there shouldn't be any arsenic and very 
bizarre magnetic fields there where you 

2486
02:11:00,501 --> 02:11:05,501
can put down your compass and it keeps 
on spinning and things like that at the 

2487
02:11:05,501 --> 02:11:07,760
beginning and the end of this runway 
looking like strips.

2488
02:11:08,420 --> 02:11:13,420
Excuse me.
And so something definitely happened 

2489
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:18,071
there because the whole idea that it was
very easy to build these things is 

2490
02:11:18,071 --> 02:11:19,760
nonsense because people have suggested,
oh,

2491
02:11:19,770 --> 02:11:22,820
all you have to do is you have to 
scratch off the surface of the,

2492
02:11:23,350 --> 02:11:28,350
off the off the ground,
and then you expose the lighter and 

2493
02:11:28,350 --> 02:11:30,200
darker underground with the pebbles and 
things like that.

2494
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:34,800
We've tried that and people have tried.
It doesn't work that way.

2495
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:37,070
So many things in Peru,
it's not just that,

2496
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:39,890
oh no.
With Machu Picchu and the skulls,

2497
02:11:39,891 --> 02:11:41,510
those people that were forming their 
heads,

2498
02:11:41,690 --> 02:11:45,170
what is the explanation for that?
They made their heads or an alien heads.

2499
02:11:45,470 --> 02:11:47,430
They flatten them out and them out 
mountain.

2500
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:52,540
Well and,
and here's the crazy thing that 

2501
02:11:52,540 --> 02:11:54,380
archeology even has an answer to this.
And they say that the reason why,

2502
02:11:54,381 --> 02:11:59,381
and this was achieved by binding the 
infant's head upon birth with the wooden

2503
02:12:00,171 --> 02:12:03,430
boards so that the brains or the,
the,

2504
02:12:03,530 --> 02:12:05,510
the skull brain chambers,
we would,

2505
02:12:05,670 --> 02:12:08,810
you know,
grow into this elongated fashion.

2506
02:12:09,870 --> 02:12:11,810
And the archeologists are saying,
well,

2507
02:12:11,811 --> 02:12:16,811
yes,
of course they did this because they 

2508
02:12:16,811 --> 02:12:18,671
were mimicking or worshiping their gods.
And then they pat each other on the 

2509
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:23,660
shoulder and then they go home and say,
case solved mystery done.

2510
02:12:23,990 --> 02:12:25,460
We're out of here.
This is it.

2511
02:12:25,850 --> 02:12:28,400
And that is exactly where I say,
no,

2512
02:12:28,401 --> 02:12:32,150
this isn't that where the mystery is not
solved because the question is,

2513
02:12:32,151 --> 02:12:33,230
okay,
you just said,

2514
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:37,700
but this was done in order to worship 
the gods.

2515
02:12:38,270 --> 02:12:39,500
Well,
my question is,

2516
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:44,770
who were these gods?
That is the question that the 

2517
02:12:44,770 --> 02:12:47,081
archeologists are not answering.
Are there any images that they have of 

2518
02:12:47,081 --> 02:12:47,570
these gods?
These,

2519
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,990
for example,
it all over ancient Egypt,

2520
02:12:50,991 --> 02:12:55,991
which by the way did the Sgo deformation
phenomenon also happened in ancient 

2521
02:12:55,991 --> 02:12:57,440
Egypt.
It happened in Germany.

2522
02:12:57,441 --> 02:12:59,990
It happened in Russia all around the 
world.

2523
02:12:59,991 --> 02:13:04,910
Do we have these elongated skulls that 
are obviously human in origin,

2524
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:07,250
but they all have all these elongated 
heads.

2525
02:13:07,251 --> 02:13:12,251
And then there are some scholars that we
don't know if they're really human in 

2526
02:13:12,891 --> 02:13:13,490
origin.
I mean,

2527
02:13:13,491 --> 02:13:15,870
who knows that star child thing.
When you think about that,

2528
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:20,880
is that a horseshit that for example?
I mean it's definitely something worth 

2529
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:21,080
looking into.
Absolutely.

2530
02:13:21,081 --> 02:13:24,200
There's no question in my mind,
but to return to the Eland,

2531
02:13:24,930 --> 02:13:27,220
you don't know about star child now.
Star child skull,

2532
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:30,400
the they found it's really freaky 
looking.

2533
02:13:30,470 --> 02:13:32,010
They've determined that it's human,
but it

2534
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:36,180
might be human plus something else like 
the mitochondrial Dna,

2535
02:13:36,181 --> 02:13:41,181
whatever the fuck it was.
I think it was determined that the 

2536
02:13:41,181 --> 02:13:41,181
mother was human.
They don't know what father was.

2537
02:13:41,181 --> 02:13:42,600
Yeah.
This is just reading it online.

2538
02:13:42,601 --> 02:13:45,240
It could easily just be some horrible 
birth defects.

2539
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:47,760
It's,
it's to be debated,

2540
02:13:47,761 --> 02:13:50,370
but the thing,
it's definitely a fascinating story that

2541
02:13:50,450 --> 02:13:55,450
you know,
merits further investigation out of all 

2542
02:13:55,450 --> 02:13:55,950
these sites.
Replaces,

2543
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:58,410
haven't you been to?
I've been to most of them.

2544
02:13:58,411 --> 02:14:00,270
Eighty percent of them.
Ninety percent of them like.

2545
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:06,460
No.
I mean I know there's definitely been 

2546
02:14:06,460 --> 02:14:09,121
about to 75 percent of the stuff because
see that's the most mind blowing and 

2547
02:14:10,801 --> 02:14:11,970
putting the Puente club.
Yeah,

2548
02:14:12,100 --> 02:14:17,100
I mean look for sheer size,
it's definitely the great pyramids on 

2549
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:19,560
the Giza plateau because have you been.
You must go.

2550
02:14:19,561 --> 02:14:20,720
I met.
He's been you.

2551
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:23,220
So you know,
I've only been to you need,

2552
02:14:23,221 --> 02:14:24,340
so that's the only place I.

2553
02:14:24,510 --> 02:14:27,810
that's also crazy thing with the shadow 
play in all this.

2554
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:29,610
I mean,
you know,

2555
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:35,000
when you stand in front of that pyramid,
you're breathless that you can't 

2556
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,290
breathe.
They're so incredible.

2557
02:14:36,291 --> 02:14:41,291
It's crazy about him is that you never 
see the pyramids and the pictures that 

2558
02:14:41,291 --> 02:14:43,090
you see,
you never see that there's like a ghetto

2559
02:14:43,091 --> 02:14:45,840
and Egypt and get on all around it and 
you know what I mean?

2560
02:14:45,841 --> 02:14:50,841
They're just.
There's one side of the pyramid where 

2561
02:14:50,841 --> 02:14:52,881
it's all open desert and then right 
there you're in a ghetto and the cool 

2562
02:14:52,881 --> 02:14:55,230
thing is when you drive around this 
gallery owner and garbage,

2563
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:58,260
but the pyramid is always visible 
wherever you go.

2564
02:14:58,261 --> 02:15:01,680
So you've got this ancient monument and 
then you place.

2565
02:15:02,510 --> 02:15:03,190
Yes,
exactly.

2566
02:15:05,950 --> 02:15:09,750
Drive bys cheap goat head.
What's cool about your job?

2567
02:15:09,780 --> 02:15:14,780
You have your job is so cool that if 
there was ever a chick that was like a 

2568
02:15:14,780 --> 02:15:16,650
little bit out of your league,
you could always saying it,

2569
02:15:16,651 --> 02:15:19,200
I'm going to Machu Picchu next week and 
I want you to go with me.

2570
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:20,970
Right?
What girl wouldn't doubt will.

2571
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,070
We were saying that our Thomson girl,
if I was a chicken,

2572
02:15:24,090 --> 02:15:29,090
pretty willing to fuck,
I'm just telling me so much about Machu 

2573
02:15:29,090 --> 02:15:31,760
Picchu,
men who are trying to deal closer right 

2574
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:32,880
there.
You have good genetics,

2575
02:15:32,881 --> 02:15:34,040
and we get traveled,
man,

2576
02:15:34,050 --> 02:15:38,280
a man with that kind of experienced sort
of a nerd,

2577
02:15:38,281 --> 02:15:43,281
but damn,
that's crazy hair and all of his 

2578
02:15:43,281 --> 02:15:43,281
jewelry.
I do want to go to Easter island.

2579
02:15:43,281 --> 02:15:46,590
Who the Puma,
the Nazi symbol built into it.

2580
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:49,470
Got One part.
I bet he has chicks laying it out.

2581
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:51,840
You probably have chicks laying it out 
on Easter island.

2582
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:54,570
You know what I mean?
And and along the input,

2583
02:15:54,610 --> 02:15:59,610
put a swastika was a swastika and put 
them up there because all around the 

2584
02:16:00,511 --> 02:16:02,550
world,
in fact the swastika is,

2585
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:07,760
has its origin in ancient India and 
Hindu and good fortune.

2586
02:16:08,581 --> 02:16:10,050
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

2587
02:16:10,060 --> 02:16:13,740
So the first telling people that now,
first of all,

2588
02:16:13,741 --> 02:16:16,410
they reversed the reverse that 
direction,

2589
02:16:16,411 --> 02:16:17,640
but whatever.
I mean,

2590
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,590
but the bottom line is they're ruined 
that.

2591
02:16:19,591 --> 02:16:24,591
And the little mustache,
Michael Jordan tried to bring back that 

2592
02:16:24,591 --> 02:16:28,201
a little monster.
So that's kind of an ego that 

2593
02:16:28,201 --> 02:16:28,201
motherfucker has.
Maybe they reversed it to say,

2594
02:16:28,201 --> 02:16:29,440
sign of death instead of sign of good 
fortune or

2595
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:35,460
bad fortune gang.
They just stole it and it was also used 

2596
02:16:35,460 --> 02:16:36,250
in ancient Greece.
I mean,

2597
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:39,430
it's not the same.
They did reverse it.

2598
02:16:39,431 --> 02:16:39,850
Yes,
yes,

2599
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:42,160
absolutely.
Symbolism is fascinating,

2600
02:16:42,161 --> 02:16:45,310
which is one of the most fascinating 
things to me about the Egyptian language

2601
02:16:45,311 --> 02:16:50,311
that it was all symbols,
but instead of with us with letters and 

2602
02:16:50,311 --> 02:16:54,101
each letter having a sound that what 
they have is like symbols and he said 

2603
02:16:54,101 --> 02:16:56,530
that apparently just absorbing the 
language isn't interpreting and just has

2604
02:16:56,531 --> 02:16:59,080
a completely different experience in the
human mind.

2605
02:16:59,370 --> 02:17:03,310
You know these all these symbols.
We have symbols that we re register like

2606
02:17:03,311 --> 02:17:05,620
this is a McDonald's symbol,
this is citgo,

2607
02:17:05,621 --> 02:17:10,621
this but their language consistent of 
these things and that is a completely 

2608
02:17:10,621 --> 02:17:14,350
different experience than reading our 
language and the ancient,

2609
02:17:14,351 --> 02:17:17,140
the incas had not.
They had string.

2610
02:17:17,820 --> 02:17:19,000
That was their language,
their.

2611
02:17:19,060 --> 02:17:21,190
That was their written language number.

2612
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:25,360
Why they got jacked by the Spanish.
The Spanish came over and go,

2613
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:30,480
Yo,
Yo writing string with a shop to giving 

2614
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:32,350
us a gold.
Let's get the gold for that motherfucker

2615
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:37,380
on the ship.
That is rather because what wants the 

2616
02:17:37,380 --> 02:17:38,860
gold ran out?
They started fucking slicing,

2617
02:17:39,550 --> 02:17:44,550
realizing that they weren't God's 
anymore till they thought people on 

2618
02:17:44,550 --> 02:17:44,830
horses were gods.
Well,

2619
02:17:44,980 --> 02:17:48,720
there's actually a little bit more to 
that story and that is that get out.

2620
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:54,660
That was,
it was toward the end that many Asian 

2621
02:17:56,921 --> 02:18:01,210
cultures based their whole calendar on 
the return of the gods.

2622
02:18:01,270 --> 02:18:03,250
And it just so happened that,
uh,

2623
02:18:03,260 --> 02:18:08,260
you know,
both Cortez and Pittsboro happened to 

2624
02:18:08,260 --> 02:18:11,460
arrive on the shores in the same year.
Fucking lucked out is it?

2625
02:18:12,730 --> 02:18:17,730
Absolutely is,
was complete chance and need the beard 

2626
02:18:17,931 --> 02:18:22,931
at the serpent.
The plume serpent doesn't that same 

2627
02:18:22,931 --> 02:18:24,300
thing mean a bearded man isn't there 
like a,

2628
02:18:24,390 --> 02:18:29,390
the,
the translation of Queso and Kukula con 

2629
02:18:29,390 --> 02:18:33,690
is like,
like so similar to a man with a beard 

2630
02:18:33,690 --> 02:18:33,690
and that,
you know,

2631
02:18:33,690 --> 02:18:38,470
this is one of the reasons why the 
Aztecs were so baffled by these people 

2632
02:18:38,470 --> 02:18:38,620
really are men with beards.

2633
02:18:38,670 --> 02:18:39,530
Yeah,
yeah.

2634
02:18:39,900 --> 02:18:40,540
Yes.
I mean,

2635
02:18:40,560 --> 02:18:42,640
that's,
that's part of it,

2636
02:18:42,641 --> 02:18:47,641
but to me that's kind of,
it's very elitist in,

2637
02:18:48,510 --> 02:18:52,200
in a certain way because even though 
those,

2638
02:18:52,230 --> 02:18:55,030
those theories have been proposed that 
you know,

2639
02:18:55,031 --> 02:19:00,031
and all of a sudden a,
this redheaded guy appeared with a red 

2640
02:19:00,031 --> 02:19:02,170
beard and things like that,
then that's why he was worshiped.

2641
02:19:02,171 --> 02:19:02,520
I mean,
I,

2642
02:19:02,521 --> 02:19:05,050
I don't think that people are or that,
you know,

2643
02:19:05,051 --> 02:19:07,360
the,
those coaches back then were so shallow.

2644
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:11,860
I think it has more to do that this 
quits bottler coopered con character.

2645
02:19:12,490 --> 02:19:17,490
If he was a redhead,
a guy that he flew around in this flute 

2646
02:19:17,490 --> 02:19:22,380
flying or plumed or winged serpent and 
that this winged serpent,

2647
02:19:22,391 --> 02:19:27,160
we all know that snakes do not fly and 
so you need enough mushrooms.

2648
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:27,830
They do,
Bro.

2649
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:32,920
I can talk to you and see.
Here's the thing that you can't 

2650
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:36,080
attribute everything that a person sees 
to mushrooms,

2651
02:19:36,270 --> 02:19:38,690
mushrooms,
because you've done enough mushrooms.

2652
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:40,040
You can.
Yes.

2653
02:19:40,100 --> 02:19:40,580
Not.
Look,

2654
02:19:40,860 --> 02:19:43,040
I have to say something about yes.
No,

2655
02:19:43,041 --> 02:19:48,041
but the thing is that our collective 
through our collective consciousness 

2656
02:19:48,041 --> 02:19:49,400
today is way bigger than the collective 
consciousness.

2657
02:19:49,401 --> 02:19:50,840
Back in the day.
How do we know?

2658
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:55,310
Well,
because today if yes,

2659
02:19:55,340 --> 02:19:57,410
no,
I mean the thing is that you know today,

2660
02:19:57,650 --> 02:20:01,670
if we see if we see a spaceship or a 
Ufo,

2661
02:20:01,671 --> 02:20:05,240
we can immediately recognize it as a 
spaceship or a Ufo.

2662
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:09,140
Back in the day,
if you didn't know what that was,

2663
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:11,630
it doesn't matter how many mushrooms you
took,

2664
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:16,990
you still have to describe it with 
something that was a spark of 

2665
02:20:16,990 --> 02:20:18,860
inspiration or a spark of something 
that,

2666
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:22,280
that motivated or inspired all these 
stories.

2667
02:20:22,550 --> 02:20:27,550
So yes,
but how do we not know that what these 

2668
02:20:27,550 --> 02:20:29,981
stories are is people's memory of 
someone else who had seen people who 

2669
02:20:31,641 --> 02:20:36,220
were flying around and it was thousands 
and thousands of years ago over time,

2670
02:20:36,230 --> 02:20:37,160
but that's the story.

2671
02:20:37,450 --> 02:20:39,000
More and more diluted.
Well,

2672
02:20:39,310 --> 02:20:43,400
it goes back to heal and they and they 
absolutely did.

2673
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:45,230
They did get diluted.
That's the whole.

2674
02:20:45,670 --> 02:20:47,240
That's the whole idea that,
you know,

2675
02:20:47,241 --> 02:20:49,150
that's why we have,
you know,

2676
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:53,750
Christianity today and Islam and all 
those different things.

2677
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:57,830
I believe you believe these depiction of
humanity,

2678
02:20:57,831 --> 02:21:02,831
that we were engineered from a lower 
primates by some aliens to mine for 

2679
02:21:02,831 --> 02:21:06,740
gold.
I subscribe to the sort of first,

2680
02:21:06,741 --> 02:21:08,840
uh,
as a part of that statement,

2681
02:21:08,841 --> 02:21:09,460
yes,
that,

2682
02:21:09,490 --> 02:21:14,490
that we came about through a direct 
targeted mutation of our genes and that 

2683
02:21:15,650 --> 02:21:17,420
that will be the ultimate proof by the 
way,

2684
02:21:17,421 --> 02:21:22,421
the ultimate proof of visitation,
willing to be in a crash spaceship or a 

2685
02:21:22,760 --> 02:21:25,040
finding a ray gun or something silly 
like that,

2686
02:21:25,041 --> 02:21:30,041
but it'll be an hour.
It will be found in our own genes that 

2687
02:21:30,041 --> 02:21:31,700
something happened in the past that did 
not come by chance,

2688
02:21:31,730 --> 02:21:36,730
but haven't they already mapped out the 
human genome is not how they understand 

2689
02:21:36,730 --> 02:21:40,331
like the people,
white people mostly related to 

2690
02:21:40,331 --> 02:21:42,020
neanderthals and they've definitely 
figured out all these things.

2691
02:21:42,420 --> 02:21:43,400
Yes,
of course.

2692
02:21:43,401 --> 02:21:46,970
I mean there's definitely many,
many conclusions have been drawn,

2693
02:21:46,971 --> 02:21:49,820
but there's still some mystery in the 
human genome.

2694
02:21:50,590 --> 02:21:52,100
Absolutely.
For example,

2695
02:21:52,101 --> 02:21:52,640
that,
you know,

2696
02:21:52,641 --> 02:21:57,641
95 percent of our human genome,
of our DNA makeup allegedly is junk.

2697
02:21:58,650 --> 02:22:00,800
I,
I completely disagree with that.

2698
02:22:00,801 --> 02:22:05,801
Just because we can't decipher those 95 
percent yet doesn't mean that that 95 

2699
02:22:08,421 --> 02:22:13,421
percent truly is garbage.
I think that in our lifetime and things 

2700
02:22:14,330 --> 02:22:17,260
are going to change quickly though,
and no,

2701
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:19,580
we were not create a slaves.
No,

2702
02:22:19,820 --> 02:22:24,110
absolutely don't believe that's again 
and glue nonsense.

2703
02:22:24,140 --> 02:22:29,140
So they came and they just sort of 
fucked with people and created what we 

2704
02:22:29,140 --> 02:22:31,110
will do 5,000
years from now on another planet.

2705
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:32,180
You know,
if,

2706
02:22:32,220 --> 02:22:34,500
if we want to experiment and I think 
that,

2707
02:22:34,501 --> 02:22:38,790
you know,
good in the end always outweighs the bad

2708
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:42,060
talk to the Indians.
They got checked well,

2709
02:22:42,350 --> 02:22:44,490
but seriously that,
you know,

2710
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:49,560
you can definitely make an argument that
if we go out there that it won't be to 

2711
02:22:50,491 --> 02:22:52,440
destroy others,
but you know,

2712
02:22:52,510 --> 02:22:54,660
in a benevolent way in

2713
02:22:55,130 --> 02:23:00,130
planet earth,
every single intelligent animal that's 

2714
02:23:00,130 --> 02:23:00,130
less intelligent than us.
We've been slaved.

2715
02:23:00,130 --> 02:23:02,690
We fucked with dolphins,
Orca as monkeys,

2716
02:23:02,720 --> 02:23:05,060
chimps,
everything that we can fuck me,

2717
02:23:05,061 --> 02:23:06,980
fuck everything that we can eat.
We eat.

2718
02:23:07,130 --> 02:23:10,010
And that is the evidence of every other 
intelligent life.

2719
02:23:10,011 --> 02:23:15,011
How it treats that other intelligent 
life that it can manipulate like 

2720
02:23:15,011 --> 02:23:17,960
dolphins killing other dolphins and 
orcas killing dolphins,

2721
02:23:18,190 --> 02:23:23,190
orchids killing whales.
But I also think that that is why that 

2722
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:26,730
is the reason why we have not yet made 
official contact with any type.

2723
02:23:26,830 --> 02:23:28,020
So we're not ready.
We're not.

2724
02:23:28,350 --> 02:23:32,280
You fucked too many animals.
I wonder what are the top,

2725
02:23:32,390 --> 02:23:37,390
the top five animals that we fuck as I 
would say sheep number one donkeys.

2726
02:23:38,610 --> 02:23:43,090
That Colombian donkey show you ever 
watch that chicken flock of chickens.

2727
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:46,140
Dogs.
People fucked her dogs for sure.

2728
02:23:47,090 --> 02:23:48,950
Then the Dave Chappelle bit about.
Try to fuck him.

2729
02:23:49,980 --> 02:23:50,770
Fuck him.
Fuck him.

2730
02:23:50,910 --> 02:23:55,910
Mcgee Mcgee.
It'll take off like a piece of celery 

2731
02:23:58,311 --> 02:24:03,311
and throw it in the tall grass.
So in closing,

2732
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:09,240
this isn't going crazy at the top five 
right there.

2733
02:24:09,260 --> 02:24:12,040
Took us 20 fucking seconds.
It's not hard.

2734
02:24:12,820 --> 02:24:16,180
Jellyfish.
There was someone really crazy seated.

2735
02:24:16,270 --> 02:24:20,580
Enemy's enemy frog second pocket 
flashlight.

2736
02:24:20,780 --> 02:24:21,600
Yeah,
for chimps,

2737
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:22,000
right?

2738
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:29,030
Tranquilizer.
I met through the front lines and just 

2739
02:24:29,030 --> 02:24:29,850
to get off track.
I see that guy,

2740
02:24:29,851 --> 02:24:30,990
that congressman,
they got busted.

2741
02:24:30,991 --> 02:24:33,480
He's a furry apparently has been doing a
lot of weird shit.

2742
02:24:33,481 --> 02:24:36,880
He's kind of tiger costume.
Congressman Lou,

2743
02:24:36,890 --> 02:24:38,880
his,
his staff's trying to get him to resign.

2744
02:24:38,881 --> 02:24:40,200
I don't know if he's resigned yet.
It's,

2745
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:42,570
it's inevitable,
but he's a.

2746
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:45,190
apparently he's out of his fucking mind 
dressing up like a tiger.

2747
02:24:47,080 --> 02:24:52,050
It's like one of those kids costumes.
Not even a cool cut tiger constantly.

2748
02:24:52,051 --> 02:24:53,760
Well,
that's what the firies were.

2749
02:24:53,761 --> 02:24:58,761
You know,
we've talked about furries in the 

2750
02:24:58,761 --> 02:25:00,381
podcast before because I was in 
Pittsburgh and they had a furry 

2751
02:25:00,381 --> 02:25:02,961
convention at the same time that the UFC
was in Pittsburgh and all these firies 

2752
02:25:02,961 --> 02:25:07,311
were wandering the streets and the 
people in the hotel sent me hip to 

2753
02:25:07,311 --> 02:25:07,380
furries because they go to Pittsburgh 
every year.

2754
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:08,280
So the,
uh,

2755
02:25:08,281 --> 02:25:11,640
the guys that are working in the hotel 
tell you the nutty stories,

2756
02:25:11,641 --> 02:25:15,090
these people shitting and litter boxes 
and some of the furry community actually

2757
02:25:15,091 --> 02:25:17,100
got upset with me that I was spreading 
misinformation.

2758
02:25:17,310 --> 02:25:18,120
Well,
I say no,

2759
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:19,750
you may not.
If you're a furry,

2760
02:25:19,751 --> 02:25:21,990
you may not be into the dirty aspect of 
the furry,

2761
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:24,490
but there's a broad spectrum of furry 
behavior folks.

2762
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:27,510
And just because you're not into taking 
shits in letter boxes,

2763
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:32,560
it doesn't mean that the man who worked 
the West and didn't tell me that they 

2764
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:35,611
called down and asked to put a large 
litter box in the lobby of the western 

2765
02:25:35,611 --> 02:25:37,570
because the firies had every room in the
western.

2766
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:40,190
So they wanted a litter box.
One,

2767
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:42,760
one litter box for everyone.
Yeah.

2768
02:25:42,761 --> 02:25:43,510
The Guy who,
uh,

2769
02:25:43,630 --> 02:25:47,350
I asked the guy who was delivering the 
food and the room service guy,

2770
02:25:47,351 --> 02:25:51,100
he said that they asked for bose like 
the feet on the ground,

2771
02:25:51,400 --> 02:25:52,510
like d,
like dog bowls,

2772
02:25:52,511 --> 02:25:54,310
like big bowls and what?
All their food in bowls.

2773
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:56,050
And then they go over there.
The bowls are on the ground,

2774
02:25:56,230 --> 02:25:58,190
like bowls of milk,
fast for large bulk.

2775
02:25:58,670 --> 02:26:01,200
They eat like an animal.
And this dude's a congressmen.

2776
02:26:01,380 --> 02:26:02,170
There's,
we're,

2777
02:26:02,190 --> 02:26:06,490
we're so up the ass of politicians that 
there's no one left but crazy people.

2778
02:26:06,730 --> 02:26:08,560
There's no one left.
But Michele Bachmann's,

2779
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:13,760
you've got to be completely had to 
fucking lunch to want to be the 

2780
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:13,760
president of this country.

2781
02:26:14,670 --> 02:26:19,630
Coming from the alien guy that's saying 
a lot Thursday,

2782
02:26:20,260 --> 02:26:23,200
ancient aliens.
The premier of season three.

2783
02:26:23,230 --> 02:26:24,280
Good luck with that,
sir.

2784
02:26:24,400 --> 02:26:29,400
Thank you very much for coming on the 
podcast and if you want to follow 

2785
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:30,550
Giorgio on twitter,
it's sucralose.

2786
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:35,760
T S O u k a l a l l o s o s.
I'm going to say it again.

2787
02:26:38,831 --> 02:26:43,831
I'm going to ps,
this is sucralose at t s o u k a l o s.

2788
02:26:46,450 --> 02:26:47,590
nice.
Got It.

2789
02:26:47,650 --> 02:26:49,780
And Eddie,
I'm going to be an El Paso.

2790
02:26:49,820 --> 02:26:53,140
A 10th planet El Paso this Saturday go 
to 10th planet.

2791
02:26:53,141 --> 02:26:54,430
Jj,
you gotta reschedule,

2792
02:26:54,431 --> 02:26:55,150
right?
You got sick.

2793
02:26:55,260 --> 02:26:58,360
I got sick last weekend so I rescheduled
it for this Saturday at 10:00

2794
02:26:58,370 --> 02:26:59,710
at j.
j.com.

2795
02:27:00,190 --> 02:27:03,250
And get on the forum.
That's the name of my phone.

2796
02:27:03,460 --> 02:27:05,380
10th 10th clowns.
Jujitsu.

2797
02:27:05,381 --> 02:27:06,880
We love it.
That's great man.

2798
02:27:06,930 --> 02:27:11,930
We named it.
Well now you're a high talking about 

2799
02:27:11,930 --> 02:27:14,370
Zechariah Bureau judo,
Jujitsu and then it sounded too weird.

2800
02:27:14,900 --> 02:27:18,970
Junk on the planet.
I'm not stupid.

2801
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:21,880
Two minutes later I thought,
damn,

2802
02:27:22,510 --> 02:27:27,510
that sound way better than me,
so I named my beer then be really for 

2803
02:27:28,750 --> 02:27:33,750
them.
That's where all the information you 

2804
02:27:33,750 --> 02:27:33,750
Jitsu history bitches.
August 13th,

2805
02:27:33,820 --> 02:27:37,480
August 13th,
I will be in Milwaukee With Mad Flavor,

2806
02:27:37,481 --> 02:27:41,620
Aka Joey Diaz at the PAPP's theater.
Tickets are still available.

2807
02:27:41,621 --> 02:27:45,910
They are going fast though.
And then September 23rd at the paramount

2808
02:27:45,911 --> 02:27:50,911
in Denver.
Holla at your boy and that is the last 

2809
02:27:50,911 --> 02:27:51,610
time I checked those have sold out 
already.

2810
02:27:51,820 --> 02:27:56,820
And um,
it's only been on sale for a couple of 

2811
02:27:56,820 --> 02:27:56,820
days.
Denver showing mad love.

2812
02:27:56,820 --> 02:28:00,631
Can't wait to get back to Colorado 
before the end of the earth for the 

2813
02:28:00,631 --> 02:28:01,660
civilization corrodes.
And that's where I live.

2814
02:28:03,070 --> 02:28:05,980
I turned away because I'm going to 
travel through space.

2815
02:28:06,070 --> 02:28:07,480
Speed of light.
Come back 13,000

2816
02:28:07,481 --> 02:28:12,481
years.
There's a lot of shit that happened in 

2817
02:28:12,481 --> 02:28:12,481
this podcast and not a lot of.

2818
02:28:12,481 --> 02:28:12,481
It was good.
A lot of it was strange.

2819
02:28:12,970 --> 02:28:16,180
Brian fell asleep at least five times.
I noticed it.

2820
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:17,870
Eddie Bravo.
I'm just drunk off it.

2821
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:21,440
Any questions before we leave for this?
Man?

2822
02:28:21,490 --> 02:28:24,860
You were fucking chomping at the bit to 
get in here on this podcast.

2823
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:30,880
I was just,
I want her to sit and listen to him 

2824
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:32,920
talk.
I know we got into dirty shit at the 

2825
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:33,530
end,
so I feel like he corrupted enough.

2826
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:35,930
We did.
We did enough damage to Zam.

2827
02:28:35,931 --> 02:28:36,600
Beautiful.
Alright.

2828
02:28:36,650 --> 02:28:38,300
Thank you everybody.
Thanks for tuning in.

2829
02:28:38,450 --> 02:28:40,820
That's it for this week.
We'll be back next week.

2830
02:28:40,821 --> 02:28:42,410
We're trying to rub it together with Jay
Moore.

2831
02:28:42,411 --> 02:28:47,411
He was busy this week and next week 
probably Joe Diaz and Duncan trussell.

2832
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:49,460
We'll see you soon.
Thank you.

2833
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:55,220
And thank you to the fleshlight is if
