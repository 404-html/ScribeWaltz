00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,210
Yeah. I have no excuse for
the order. We do things then.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,590
It seems so official though. It seems
like it's now a real show. Sure.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,790
Before we were just sitting around going,

11
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,340
what is this fucking thing going to
start is the other ones I've gone to are

12
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,030
just bullshit

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,910
compared to this
fucking Mark Marin and

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,510
Brian Pro San Ladies and gentlemen. Good
to see you, buddy. Good to see you, man.

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,110
I've been reading crazy, crazy things
about you and marijuana that you have.

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,590
Oh Shit. Yeah. Go like sacred. Yeah.
It's so weird that got out there. Like,

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,970
who cares?
Common QuickCare quit pot,

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,110
dude. People kids are going
to do now. I got nothing.

19
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,440
Any changes that you make in your
life. Radical changes. People.

20
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,460
There's going to be arguments,
message boards, debates. Uh,

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,540
I was really surprised and then uh,

22
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,900
people are mad at me cause I'm
doing a gathering of the Juggalos.

23
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,280
I heard about that as well. I think I lost
a few fans. Why? Wow. People are like,

24
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:28,000
what the fuck dude, why are you doing?
I thought you were cooler than that.

25
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:31,090
Like if people are like, that
is so not metal in a, you know,

26
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,990
it's metal getting a nice paycheck so my
kid can go to nursery school next year.

27
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:38,540
That's, that's pretty much super
metal. Well you know, it's also,

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,350
and it's going to be an
experience as you go.

29
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,010
If somebody offered you a nice check
to go, very possibly. Very possibly.

30
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:47,200
I would think about it. I'm called
God, what the fuck would I say?

31
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:49,560
What bits would I do where
they gotta to go? You know,

32
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,670
I'd have to like figure out
how to edit it and do it right.

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,920
I have to do fine on it.
I have two months to do that.

34
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,430
Like it's in August and so I've got
time to prepare. You know what, man,

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,810
there's the cynical in 25 minutes and I'm
falling. Harland Williams who's a yeah,

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,180
it'll be fun. Like yeah, he'll get up
there and go uh, you know, platypus.

37
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:11,350
Vagina and I'll go, okay,
I get to follow that.

38
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,810
What is the concert for people that
don't know? Cause I, I, yes, yes.

39
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,190
The, the gathering of the Juggalos
is all the insane clown posse.

40
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,540
It's all, and it's a fee. It's
to me it's a very fascinating,

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,110
fascinating movement
because I kind of look,

42
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,710
it's so easy to poke fun at them.
It's so easy to point a finger,

43
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,690
but it's also like I kinda identify
with disenfranchised people.

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,650
Most of them were really given a
shitty fucking hand in life. Yeah.

45
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,310
That's what my,

46
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,120
that's why family is like their big thing
that they say at this thing and these

47
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:43,630
insane clown posse concerts,
they'll say family, IDL, a family.

48
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,540
Like we're all like together. They
feel like they're a part of something.

49
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,650
And how has that bad,

50
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,990
no, I know that's part of why I said
yes to it. I was like, you know,

51
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:53,360
in another world I could have
been one of these kids. You know,

52
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:57,260
cause I was a mutant that sat at home
reading comic books and listening to iron

53
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,260
maiden and didn't have a family,
you know,

54
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,410
didn't have other guys that would
like the same shit as me, you know,

55
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,830
so at least they've got that,
you know?

56
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,890
I mean we can't have been in that
situation. Yeah. And people, yeah.

57
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,890
People in the Internet
really poked fun at them.

58
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,360
Like they do the shitty band there.

59
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,660
And two is so much better
than the insane clown.

60
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,780
Posse says the arctic monkeys

61
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,560
something billion levels above the ICP.
Write something really obscure.

62
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,330
But yeah,

63
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,820
that you can only get at Amoeba and
people were like almost disappointed.

64
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:34,060
I can tell, you know, when their tweets,
you know you only got 140 characters,

65
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:38,260
but it's still like, oh dude, why are
you doing that? You know? And it's like,

66
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,380
why do people care what you're doing
first now, if you're still doing,

67
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,610
you're still being you.

68
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:47,110
You're still doing your am not going to
throw a clown makeup on and go out and

69
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:51,430
throw my feces at everybody. You know,
why not? As long as he filmed it,

70
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,450
make a youtube video. Yeah.
Fuck it. That's the other thing.

71
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,250
I'm going to do my thing there.

72
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:00,840
I'm going to see how that goes over and
I'm going to have experienced stuff's

73
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,960
going to happen to me that night when I
fly out there and go to this crazy cause

74
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,360
it's out in the middle of nowhere.
That's the other thing about it.

75
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:10,600
Like where is it? Uh,
it's out in Illinois,

76
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,470
but like some place I've never heard of.
So this is a national thing.

77
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:18,340
People fly in from all across the country
and these guys are fucking gigantic

78
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,500
right now, aren't they? Yeah,
they're pretty big. So yeah.

79
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,240
But you never hear their music? No. Nobody
so strange. They played them on MTV,

80
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:28,270
like in the 90s when they first
broke and then everybody went,

81
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,160
oh these guys suck.
And then they kind of,

82
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,320
those are what I love about
them is they went dick,

83
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,250
they wanted to keep doing it and they
went underground and they went like made

84
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:42,880
their own label and these guys
have made a fortune, you know, uh,

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,980
putting their own stuff out,
which is like, you know,

86
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:48,520
a lot of comics that we know
that do that thing. You know,

87
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,300
like don't go for comedy central records.
I'm going to go to those other places.

88
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,160
And I kind of respect that,
you know,

89
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,980
that they've been able to build this
crazy fan base out of and most people had

90
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:00,610
never heard their shit at all.
Right.

91
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,350
Yeah. There's something interesting
about it and like I said,

92
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:08,000
they obviously appealed to a very certain,
a distinct group that need something,

93
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,010
right. It needs someone, you know,

94
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,310
I mean what we were talking about
earlier about the pot thing about people

95
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:17,180
freaking out about you quitting pot.
That is also a part of a movement.

96
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,200
And there's a lot of people that like to
think that, hey man, you know, for 20,

97
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:21,421
you know,

98
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:25,250
and Bob for 20 on Twitter and they want
to think that they're part of this thing

99
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:27,810
too.
And then if you leave this thing somehow,

100
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:30,410
I know that you make it a decision
to do something different with your

101
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:33,160
consciousness that you're leaving
this group, you're leaving the

102
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,820
Sandman. Well, you know what,
that's a big part of it.

103
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,660
That's a big part of why I quit is I
didn't want to be that guy anymore.

104
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:42,270
And I get why some people
like to still be that guy,

105
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,290
but for me will the big part,
it wasn't working anymore.

106
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,980
And I just have always been
one of those people that like,

107
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,400
I always hated people that went into Aa
and, or you know, or like I did cut. Okay.

108
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,520
I messed around with coke and I messed
around with crystal meth and dumb shit

109
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:02,710
like that. He's really, yeah.
Yeah. Well like before I
knew it was really bad. Like,

110
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:08,220
you know, I moved to Phoenix in
1986 and that's like where uh,

111
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,270
crystal meth was invented
pretty much. Wow. You know,

112
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,000
and a rate at that time and uh, it
wasn't a big deal but, and I did it,

113
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:18,260
I messed around and then I was
able to just go, this is stupid.

114
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,230
I don't want to do it anymore. So I've
always been that kind of gay and part,

115
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,231
you know,

116
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:27,231
I smoked for 20 something years and I
was an every day guy and an all day guy

117
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,700
and I just didn't like the way I was
feeling anymore and it just wasn't working

118
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,770
too. Like, do you ever get like that?

119
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:37,070
Like did you ever take
your tire blunt and it's,

120
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,120
and you don't even feel any different
than you did before you lit up the board?

121
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,080
I'm a huge proponent of marijuana,

122
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:47,081
but I'm also a big proponent of moderation
and pretty much everything every day.

123
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,190
I don't smoke every day.
This is when I smoked.

124
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,520
I smoked before I know I'm going to fuck
my wife smoke before I get some sex.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,730
I smoked. Sometimes we're going to go
on a date when he gets some good food.

126
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,270
I small global, then I smoked before I
write comedy. I smoked before I do comedy.

127
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:03,680
I smoked before, do Jujitsu before
movies, before video game, before I moved.

128
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,510
So this is like,

129
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,780
there's a few times where a whole day
will go by and none of those things will

130
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:12,550
happen. And I want smoke pot
and it doesn't affect me.
Or when I go on vacations,

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,250
I go on vacations, I go on vacations
with like five, six days and no pot.

132
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,690
And I never feel bad. I
just feel like me, you know,

133
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,660
I enjoy the feeling of marijuana,

134
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:24,350
but I also think it's good to know who
the fuck you are outside of the influence

135
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:25,010
of all these things.
Right.

136
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,010
And for some people have to
go back at some point and uh,

137
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,310
and do it the way you're talking
or maybe not even that much, but,

138
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:35,430
but do it like when I'm going to see
rush going to see the new eczema could,

139
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,150
but I want to,
I want to give it,

140
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,290
I want to get it out in my
system completely on how
long, right? Three months.

141
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah. And just went cold Turkey. Yeah.
It's easier when you have children too.

142
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,950
And I know you have a,
and that was the big thing.

143
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,950
Like I talked about it on what
the Fuck Marin's thing. But uh,

144
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,540
one of the things is it got,
I don't know about where you smoke here,

145
00:07:56,541 --> 00:08:01,100
but it got delegated to outside
because of the kid. And before he came,

146
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:05,430
when my wife was pregnant, we have
a smart house. But anyway, I there,

147
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,360
I couldn't smoke in my office anymore
and I couldn't smoke in the living room.

148
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,410
So then I became the outside guy.
And so it felt kind of dirty.

149
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,510
Like I need to have a shed that I was
going out to in the back. But I was,

150
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,300
you know, and it's a nice
place, but I'm out by my pool,

151
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:23,930
just kind of feeling like a scumbag,
you know, out there by myself.

152
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,510
Just to kind of get day.

153
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,530
I always do it outside just so
my house doesn't smell like weed.

154
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:31,350
Like we did it inside today
just cause I got this new thing.

155
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:33,750
It's a hemp wick instead of a lighter,

156
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,970
you light it with a
lighter and then the it,

157
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:38,550
the hemp is like a wick and
it's made out of hemp rope.

158
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:42,140
So it lasts a long time as
opposed to, well no, no, no, it's,

159
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,160
it's to light it instead
of using a lighter,

160
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,710
because I do use a lighter and I'd
smoke it out of a pipe, I'd go, Ooh,

161
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:50,420
I smelled a lighter. I smell that
fluid. I tasted a little bit. Yeah,

162
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,610
that's shit can't be good for now. So
this hemp WIC, I started doing this,

163
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:56,280
but it wouldn't work outside.
It was windy so we smoked it inside.

164
00:08:56,281 --> 00:09:00,270
But I have an air cleaner in my office
that I had on before the show and I,

165
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,050
but most of the time I'm a joint guy
and most of the time I go outside,

166
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,230
I do it on purpose. But yeah, I've
had the, I just had a debate at home.

167
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,430
I've had that the wife conversation now
does she smoke it all? Not right now.

168
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,180
She did, but then she had two babies
in a row and the first one, you know,

169
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,580
she breastfed for a year
as she did the second one.

170
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,560
And so that was like the baby's born,

171
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:22,500
the baby lives for a year and
then she's pregnant again.

172
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,860
And then the baby born the
baby breastfeeds for a year.

173
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,990
It's been a long time since she smoked
pot. So you miss it. Do you know?

174
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,680
She's down. She's almost ready
but, but um, the um, you know,

175
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:38,760
the, the, the effects to me are
important, but like anything else,

176
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:41,910
they can be abused. Just
like masturbation. I think
masturbation is great,

177
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,430
but I've had points in my life
where I was beaten off three,

178
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:47,670
four fucking times a day and and
beating off when I wasn't even hard.

179
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:51,900
I would just keep going. I go
monkey. I think we all have, I mean

180
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,200
comics and it was like combined with the
weed to doing it in a shitty hotel room

181
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,070
most of the time.

182
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,360
So the process does something really
depressing about hotel rooms when you're

183
00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:05,900
high blown it out the window.
Just sitting there with my flacid common

184
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,150
threat I think,
you know,

185
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,780
he's like don't want to watch
just as like seen everything else.

186
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,580
Yeah, like eighties movies. Yeah.
Check from sex and the city was hot.

187
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,070
Remember she played a mannequin
that came to life at the trial.

188
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:26,740
She was fucking mannequin.
Yeah.

189
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,710
I can see what you were talking
about. You were doing, you were,

190
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,220
you had a pretty extreme pot thing going
on. They all day, everyday pot thing.

191
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:33,580
Is it

192
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,210
that totally makes it not work.
And I got,

193
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,310
I've had been to that point before and
then I take like three days off and then

194
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,380
the weed works again automatically.
You know,

195
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,770
for years I wasn't awakened bake
guy and then it just became,

196
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,790
if I didn't have a job,

197
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,780
if I didn't have a writing job I was going
to in the morning I wake and bake and

198
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,470
then you know what I'm supposed to be
like trying to write things to sell or,

199
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,810
or work on my own act or you know,

200
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:58,710
write a book and it's just
fucking impossible when you
start smoking at 10:00 AM

201
00:10:58,711 --> 00:10:59,580
or at least for me.

202
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,790
Yeah, I think everybody's got a
different biochemistry cause for me, man,

203
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,680
I smoke and that's when
I do my best writing.

204
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,030
I smoke and I sit down and I just get
into the groove and I just lose myself and

205
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,050
there's a window for

206
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,120
me. There's a window for jokes.
I mean, I've written, you know,

207
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,840
the last 20 years of my standup,

208
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,630
most of those jokes have been written
high and so that's kind of a challenge for

209
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:21,330
me now is like to see,
see what happens,

210
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,290
not high to see what the
materials like has it changed?

211
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:29,730
Have you noticed any change? Shit.
What about your sets on stage?

212
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,430
Uh, they're feeling good
though. They're actually,

213
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:37,431
I'm way more focused and a faster like
a faster rhythm speak because I'm more

214
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:42,270
present. Um, my wife's definitely
noticed that just in talking to me.

215
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:45,390
Like when I walk into the house she's
like, Whoa, you're like, you know,

216
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:49,990
you're not hey man. Yeah, yeah. That,

217
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,070
what kind of plot did you smoke? Uh,
you know, that's the other thing.

218
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,340
Like I've never been one of those
guys that knows every strain. But uh,

219
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,410
what's the one that puts you to sleep?
Yeah.

220
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,160
Diva. Oh, they're so different, man.

221
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,490
It's really like talking about
two totally different things.

222
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:09,520
It's almost like talking about
alcohol versus a stimulant. I mean,

223
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,750
there so completely different.

224
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,180
Do you find your self having
problems being around it now?

225
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:15,670
Like he hung hang out with Doug Benson.
Me Like I can't Damon.

226
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,130
And I don't even know if he
knows. I quote. He texted me,

227
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:20,560
he texted me right before the show,

228
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:23,200
make sure you ask Brian about
quitting pot cause you know,

229
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,550
Doug flies that fucking fly high crowd
to him and he's like, what the fuck?

230
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,490
You know, I'm the guy that started
him on that road. Really? Yeah.

231
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,760
It wasn't really a smoker and I bought
him his first pipe first moved down there.

232
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,720
He didn't know. He, you know, he
did. He did occasionally done it, uh,

233
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:42,940
when he'd come up to San
Francisco and hang out with us.

234
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:47,941
But I moved down to La and he and I had
a writing gig together for MTV and like

235
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,860
94. And uh, at that point was
not a stoner at all. And uh,

236
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,080
I was already and uh,
you know,

237
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,440
just got Amanda the everyday thing and
then he's one of the biggest donor comics

238
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,280
while you're his sensei area,
since he is kind of,

239
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,340
it was just to be so hard for him.
It must be really weird. Yeah.

240
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,070
Have you seen Doug on that
old curb your enthusiasm?

241
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:11,860
It doesn't even look like him.
He looks like this clean cut gentlemen.

242
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:16,000
It's so weird on that. No.
How Caribbean enthusiasm.

243
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:19,200
But he's only not that old. Yeah.
Five, six years ago. So weird.

244
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,600
It's totally different. Yeah. And like
in what way? What looks different?

245
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,970
She really clean cut back then.
I don't know.

246
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,270
I mean of course it was probably
his character also. But yeah,

247
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:31,270
I mean he just looked very
different anyway. So He's,

248
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,890
has he contacted you about
it? No, we haven't talked.
Uh, obviously he's concerned.

249
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,100
It's hilarious.
And I'm hanging out with Sarah this week.

250
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,920
Who was another one in my pothead
friends, you know, Sarah Silverman.

251
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:46,180
So it'll be weird like to be at
the Improv and not go around back.

252
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,790
You know, that uh, that alley where, uh,

253
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,920
we've been smoking for
15 years. Have you? Um,

254
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,940
you got to try it. Well, if you ever
do, you got to try sativas before. If,

255
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,450
if you ever decide, I mean
don't do whatever the fuck
you want to do, but no man,

256
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,980
if you ever decide this is a different
thing, you know who to somebody,

257
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:09,260
one of my friends was like,
oh, you're taking a sabbatical.

258
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,210
And at first I was like, what a
stoner thing to say. Like, like that,

259
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:17,120
I'm for sure going to
come back. But, uh, I,

260
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:21,820
I don't want to be back to what I was.
And so the idea, like I said, yeah,

261
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:25,630
I'd love to get to the point, I'm going
to see Russia next month or next week.

262
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,210
You have to, and I'm not going to
do it with this next rush show,

263
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,640
but next year when they come back,
you know,

264
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:33,070
I'd love to then be
able to go and you know,

265
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:36,520
when they play passage to Bangkok and
you're right on, what's your goal?

266
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:40,650
Like what's your time wise goal? Do you
have like a milestone a year, you know,

267
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,310
and I'm using the program, which you're
going to the classes. So you be somebody,

268
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,260
you say the program you're doing, you're
doing an alcoholics anonymous. Yes, I am.

269
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,740
Yeah. Yeah. Why did you decide to do that
instead of this club right now? Well, no,

270
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:57,140
I've taught, Nah, well, here's the
reason I'm going to, you know, this is,

271
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,320
it sounds like a joke, but, and
it will be a joke at some point,

272
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:04,540
but I'm not big of a map of a
loser to go to Ebay. I think

273
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,630
it's just pot. You know, it's, it's a
couple of hundred bucks a month, you know,

274
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:12,870
there's gonna be guys like,
you know,

275
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,280
I just told my mom for heroin
and shit like that. You know,

276
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,520
we're where the stories are way more than
Brent material for me. Yeah, no, I know.

277
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,960
Certainly. Well, this is going
to be a huge bit for sure. Yeah.

278
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,750
That's all kind of a fascinating thing,
isn't it? It's true. When the hard drugs,

279
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:29,210
the really hard ones, man,
those stories are horrific.

280
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,280
That's the dehumanizing drugs.

281
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,510
I just felt like I'd be the biggest
pussy in the ram if I went to an Aa

282
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,480
from, uh, from,

283
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:44,040
from half baked that happens in that
I wasn't, they had a meeting. Oh no,

284
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,510
no one ever suck cock for pot.
I'll, okay. It was a Bob sad sack.

285
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,870
That's probably a scene. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Oh, I to watch that again. No,

286
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,150
that'll make me want to get high.

287
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,220
Have you ever thought about doing the Dr
Jury Show? That would be pretty funny.

288
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:02,860
We get tonight, are you? I'm doing
the regular blah, blah. Any Rehab?

289
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,290
No, no, no. It wasn't.

290
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,390
I don't know what they
showed me the career too.

291
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,100
I actually still work true,
dude. You don't understand.

292
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:15,710
You're not sort of quote unquote
in the business you do that.

293
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:20,180
It's over you celebrity basically saying
I suck and I have for a long time.

294
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,961
You don't just say,

295
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:23,340
you're not just saying be packing
in and that's what you're saying.

296
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,771
You're saying,

297
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:27,530
I really don't have anywhere to turn
and willing to be in this house for six

298
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:29,270
weeks because I need a paycheck.
Right.

299
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,390
The only two people that do it or if
you're desperate for attention in some way

300
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,160
or another, you're going to
think you're gonna f fashion.

301
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:38,180
Some reality show career. Again,
those people are real drug addicts.

302
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:40,880
Almost everybody except the
weak people. Yeah. Well,

303
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,830
there was only one weed
guy ever, right? No,

304
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:47,420
I think there was more than one wrapper.
The wrapper was a week to some girl.

305
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,720
Well the worst one was Eric Roberts.
Eric Roberts was there for weed.

306
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:53,000
The fucking guy.
There's nothing wrong it is that what his,

307
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:58,010
everyone's shaking and wedding and
it was weed. He's drinking coffee,

308
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:02,600
reading the newspaper. Not only did he
fucking smoke weed, he used a vaporizer.

309
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,060
So he's doing it healthy. Right.
He's like, I just thought he's,

310
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:07,850
I think he just want to get the fuck
away from his wife. Just like, honey,

311
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:12,620
I've gotta be there for six weeks,
six weeks. That wasn't a good dude.

312
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:16,910
Just died. Didn't need from a
grease. Uh, yes. Yeah. That was sad.

313
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,610
That was a sad part of that show
and I thought, yeah, he was,

314
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,630
he was on my dead pool cause he was,
he was in the class. I really have one,

315
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:27,140
but a Conaway Jeff Conway.

316
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,020
And he apparently he had
some serious infection.

317
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,720
Didn't know he had the infection
because he was high on time.

318
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,890
He was so messed up on that show.
He was hard to watch. It was hard.

319
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,290
I've only watched a few episodes of
that show. I watched one with, um,

320
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,161
Heidi Fleiss,

321
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:43,630
which I thought was fascinating and I
watched the recent one with that. Uh,

322
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,080
the old model lady. Oh, he's
really kind of nutty. Yeah.

323
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:50,130
What's a haggard? Yeah. I don't know,

324
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,520
but it's fascinating because she's got
this young boyfriend. It's really weird.

325
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck that monster. Well,

326
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,040
I think he's probably a
regular guy probably works in
a supermarket or something.

327
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,470
So for him it's like, you know,
it's Janice Dickinson still. Yeah.

328
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:05,250
But she's horrible to
look at. It's scary. Well,

329
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,500
do you remember getting old?

330
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:12,501
Having an old person's face is not
nearly as scary as having an old person's

331
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:14,970
face that's been cut up to try
to appear younger. Yeah. That,

332
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:19,380
those are surgery in this city,
like terrific. My wife hates it,

333
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:23,370
but I'll like, I'll whisper to my kid,
you know, and he's only two, but I'll go,

334
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:25,220
look, there's monsters, monsters,

335
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,480
let's call it, I always call
it monster face. It's, it's,

336
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:34,650
it's like I was watching a,
I'm one of those Joan Rivers things.

337
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,100
It was on comedy central. I swear
to God, Bro, for 15 minutes.

338
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:39,690
I didn't absorb a word they said.

339
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,190
I was just concentrating on her face
and how her, how terrifying. It's a cat.

340
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:48,180
They're turning into cats. It's a
mask. It's what it is. It's not moving.

341
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:51,780
It's so obvious. It's like filled up
with something. It's going to melt event,

342
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,650
whatever the fuck. It's
so scary. It's not good.

343
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,400
Did you ever see the SQL to escape
from New York escape from la?

344
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,240
Yeah, I did probably, but I
don't remember it. Not Great.

345
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,310
But at one point Bruce Campbell
plays, uh, do you remember this? Yeah.

346
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,330
Bruce Campbell plays a plastic surgeon
that has basically created these monsters

347
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:16,920
and this 10 years ago before you really
saw these girls flooding around La.

348
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,670
And so that was the one moment of the
movie that kind of works because it's

349
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,310
carpenters saying, look out like
this shit is, you know, it's on.

350
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,860
It's why I'm probably not the
right thing. Yeah, that's,

351
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,640
it didn't really exist back in the day.

352
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,130
They're all like island of Doctor
Moreau who just kind of horrible face

353
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,820
facelifts had been around for a long
time. Right. Pull the face back.

354
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:42,120
But this is a new error when
they going not slips. Yeah. Yeah.

355
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:44,250
They do the lips and they
do the cheeks and shit.

356
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,890
There was a hot girl down syndrome,

357
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,700
hot girl down syndrome because all
the girls start to look the same.

358
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,960
Like Down Syndrome. Johnny
Carson to kind of, they all did.

359
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,660
They all have the same look.
You didn't know her Miss Mom Syndrome.

360
00:19:57,661 --> 00:20:01,230
Kids always have that same look in
the eyes and the same. It's horrible.

361
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,520
But it's true. It is true. It
is that, that's monster face.

362
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,790
They get that giant mouth. It looks like
you got to bite your fucking head off.

363
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,330
Yeah. Lisa rented took care of her is
finally cause I think so. How did she,

364
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,420
I don't know. She took, she got a
deflated or something. Some of the,

365
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:19,610
I know a woman who had it done and then
she had it taken out and it's just, it's,

366
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,110
her lips are terrifying now.
The whole thing is a mass.

367
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,470
Before she had a mind of her feet.
Big Scar too. It was real weird.

368
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,230
Like you'd be talking to her and it was
so obvious that her lips are pumped up.

369
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,350
But it would be also weird because her,
when she would move,

370
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:35,650
you'd see the scar inside her lips.
The God damn who,

371
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:40,200
who said that should be legal. That's
craziness. You're fucking with your lips,

372
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,510
man. Looks he kiss him, he
can feel it in the lips.

373
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:47,540
You can feel like a little fucking hard
gelatin in their lips and you see it in

374
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:48,310
regular places.

375
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,130
Like if you got a, I've been
shooting this thing out in Ann Arbor,

376
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,010
Michigan and you don't see these girls
walking around. Right? But yeah, here,

377
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,440
here's especially where you, yeah, you
go to the grocery store in Calabasas.

378
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,690
Fuck yeah.
It's all monster faces out here.

379
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,830
60 year old lady trying to look 45
but it's working well. The worst.

380
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:10,810
Is Newport beach ever going around
there? No, not in. Why that whole area?

381
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,920
That area's really rich and really
like nice and it's like, you know,

382
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:19,880
everyone's driving Maserati's and everyone
through Irvine Improv, which is close.

383
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,430
Like there's people that make the trek.
Yeah.

384
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,720
You see a lot of monster faces out there.
Poor women.

385
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,140
Poor women talked into
brutalizing their face.

386
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:35,410
Those husbands let them or paint for it,
I'm guessing. Yeah. Or they just gave in.

387
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,320
I just gave in and he didn't want to
listen anymore. It's just like, all right.

388
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:40,720
All right. All right. Do you want to
get your fucking lips done? You know,

389
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,570
and surprise it. Do you ever
think maybe they're just, uh,

390
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,630
did you know the worst nuclear disaster
in the world happened in Simi Valley in

391
00:21:48,631 --> 00:21:51,300
1959? Here we were taught they
were just, that's not true.

392
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,840
It sure it's not the worst nuclear
disaster ever. Not even close. Well,

393
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:57,900
this shit going on in Japan right
now. Yeah, you're wrong, bro.

394
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,970
The shit going on in Japan
right now is unbelievable.
The United States. No, no, no,

395
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,990
no. Three Mile Island. No, this is
240 times more than that accident.

396
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,690
Why that's are you getting, there's this
is like above top secret.com. No, this,

397
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,520
this, this, this happened
in 1959 and they, uh,

398
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,240
it was 240 times more than the accident
at three mile island and they kind of

399
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:19,950
covered it up and uh,

400
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,010
somebody sent this to me the other day
and there's actually like news stories

401
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:23,641
all about it.

402
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:26,970
There's a Wikipedia page all about
this and I never knew about that,

403
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,710
but it was just kind of odd that we lived

404
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,270
for accurate.
So you,

405
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,800
I assume you're talking about is
Rocketdyne him about the Rocketdyne? Yeah,

406
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,950
I don't think they have all
the information about that.

407
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:42,700
I think a huge amount of what they're
saying about what the damage and all the,

408
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,200
it's all speculation what happened
out there. They did a lot of tests.

409
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,170
Rocket Dyne is where they mean when
they were involved in the space program.

410
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:53,710
I'll throw the, you know, through the
Vietnam warm and there's all sorts of,

411
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,580
they're there,
you know,

412
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,660
they basically make arms
and fucking spaceship parts
and shit. There's a lot of,

413
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:00,280
you know,
it's doing a lot of nutty things up there,

414
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,430
but it's not one of the worst
disasters in the world. Do you?

415
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:04,500
People wouldn't be able to live here.

416
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,380
It'd be fucking six arm babies and
dogs be born with no ears. There's not,

417
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:09,990
it's not

418
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,100
from what the, the, the,
what I heard is there was a,

419
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,320
something happened there and instead of
like most of these nuclear reactors have

420
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:19,290
these huge concrete Glo,
uh, Dome's over them.

421
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,510
So if there is a leak or some
kind of radiation, it's covered.

422
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,470
But this was like kind of a test facility.
So they didn't have all these ex,

423
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,440
they didn't have to have all these
extra things and all these extra gauges.

424
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,490
It's 2011. We can't be having
these, what I heard conversations,

425
00:23:32,491 --> 00:23:35,160
I'm looking at it right now. I could
play the audio for you, but I mean,

426
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:38,260
but what are you looking at the
history channel? history.com. Let me

427
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,370
tell you something about
the history channel.

428
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:44,320
You know what gets on the history
channel, Ufo shows, go shows, robot shows.

429
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,400
Okay this is, this is what you need
to know about the history channel.

430
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,650
It's a network.
And what they do is they buy programming,

431
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,370
they want ratings and they want things
to, but they don't verify the, you know,

432
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:55,110
the claims. They don't make sure
that everything is peer reviewed.

433
00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:59,450
The talking about the history channel's
had a bunch of shows, pro and con,

434
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,680
JFK assassination,
pro conspiracy con conspiracy.

435
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,480
So for you know,
just the sake of everybody's brain,

436
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,380
you can't just,

437
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,050
but isn't that weird though to think
that the one of the craziest cities,

438
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,250
you know is Los Angeles and everything
like that and we have these people that

439
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,450
are turning into nick cats,

440
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,290
they look like cat women and we never
even think about like our air pollution is

441
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,901
so bad.

442
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:26,070
Imagine it being also mixed with toxic
shit cause I guess the rods that are in a

443
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:30,180
nuclear reactor, I guess when they act
they, something happened and they shut,

444
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,820
shut it down. And then they were
like, okay, I think it's okay.

445
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:35,640
And they turned it on for two more weeks
and then they shut it off again and

446
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,910
there were like, like, I
forget how many rods I courses

447
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,470
session Brian, because we don't really
know the real story. We can't, you know,

448
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,900
this is,
this is so frustrating.

449
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,050
Call the cops live out there
too, man. See there all the time.

450
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:52,030
Radioactive fucking Zombie cops. Well
anyways, you got to read about it.

451
00:24:52,031 --> 00:24:55,070
If you just type in,
we would know about that.

452
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,610
I feel like we would know
about that. Where's that big
of a disaster? I mean, maybe

453
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,510
nothing happened,
but it was that big.

454
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:02,520
I just don't see that you
would avoid the effects of it.

455
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:04,650
That shit was in the 60s and
the 70s right? Wasn't it?

456
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,430
1950

457
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:13,570
1950 [inaudible] I just assume we would
know about 59 apparently Japan has a

458
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:17,230
melt through now cover man,
that's government.

459
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,280
That's way we're hipsters
came from fucking, no,

460
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,130
just radiation has nothing to do
with these cat ladies are hipsters.

461
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,390
These cat ladies are there because they're
trying to hang silver lake douchebags

462
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:33,490
go weird mustaches somehow. The
rods and the air. Weird Mustache,

463
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,930
fucking skinny pants,
all those broken rides.

464
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,470
The, um, the radiation
is not doing that. Brian,

465
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,490
did you see your big movie
fan or did you see it,

466
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:48,840
the new super eight movie yet? Not yet.
No. No. You guys are talking about it.

467
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,060
Is it true?
There's rumors.

468
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:52,940
I heard that you played dungeons and
dragons with a u and a couple of guys like

469
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:55,160
pat and all that get together and
still play dungeons and dragons.

470
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,600
But, uh, right before we had kids, we did,

471
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,490
we were the only d and d group to ever
stop because three of the guys got their

472
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:04,690
wives pregnant.
Like,

473
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,630
I don't think that's ever happened before
in the history of d and d don't think

474
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:10,600
so. You don't think somewhere in
Ohio, some guys had to pull the plug.

475
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,040
They're not fucking,
I used to hear about that and just draw.

476
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,900
So tell me about, tell me about this. What
did you do you get together? Just years?

477
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,010
It was me. Uh, it started
with my buddy Gerry Duggan.

478
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,390
He writes for g four, and he was a, he and
I wrote a comic book together. And, uh,

479
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,930
we were just talking one night
with another friend going, hey man,

480
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:36,550
we'd love to get a d and d group gone.
And this goes like, I want to be a DM.

481
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,490
He's like, you know, I haven't DM to get,
what is it? The Emory [inaudible] guest?

482
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,190
Yeah, yeah. He's the guy
that runs the show. Right.

483
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,510
And it doesn't, they don't play a,
they basically, uh, you know, right.

484
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:53,400
The whole adventure for you or use those,
um, you know, use the books and uh,

485
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:55,560
you know,
basically walk you through the thing.

486
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,670
And so we went to a couple of friends
and it won't want to be in patent as well

487
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,710
and our blend capacity and I'm
sure you know, and then, uh, um,

488
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,190
Chris Hardwick was in our
group for a while too, so,

489
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,730
and it was a lot of fun and it makes
it basically, we called it nerd poker,

490
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:15,660
I called it nerd poker because it
just became a way of, you know,

491
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,250
when your friends get busy and shit,

492
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:20,400
and it's like the only way you can kind
of hang out with them is to have like a

493
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:24,060
ritual, you know what I mean? And that's
what it was. We don't play poker and,

494
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,680
and uh, you know, we had the video game,

495
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:29,520
like when Halo first started having those
land parties, yeah, we would do that.

496
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:33,260
And that was like a regular thing too.
But then that kind of went away. You know,

497
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,500
it'd be like 16 of us with four TVS on
for people on four TVs and that was a lot

498
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:40,710
of fun and a, that kind of
shit. The bed and, and uh,

499
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,330
we got this d and d game going and
that became a way of, hey honey, I,

500
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,130
you know,
I got to go do this.

501
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,460
Then you get to go hang out
with your buddies and you know,

502
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,970
we be there for four hours and we
barely get any of the adventure done.

503
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:56,070
Cause it would be just pat and going,
you know,

504
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:59,730
I just played the Shitty
club and me going, hey, have
you seen that stupid movie?

505
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,290
You know, and Imagine
Reporting Idiots, you know?

506
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,420
Yeah. You guys should have a reality
show. Yeah. Dungeons and dragons.

507
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,290
That should be a podcast
that it's not a bad idea,

508
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,290
but the reality show,

509
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:16,820
like it goes back to doing that
a doctor jury thing, to me,

510
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:21,770
any reality show is basically saying,
I've got nothing. Right. You know, please,

511
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,260
you know, give me, you know,

512
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,730
well let's not call it a reality show.

513
00:28:25,731 --> 00:28:29,260
How about a dungeons and dragons
show with four comics, right?

514
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,970
Where every week you sit down and
discuss all kinds of crazy shit.

515
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:34,670
You have subjects you want to bring up
while you're playing dungeons and dragons.

516
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,600
It's actually good.
Yeah,

517
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,450
we've definitely talked about it
over the years and you know, and uh,

518
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,331
but for me,

519
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:42,810
I always said no to it because I
didn't want to fuck the fun out of it.

520
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,430
It was just this fun thing and
I'm trying to get it going again.

521
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:49,410
I'd been talking to the DM about,
hey man,

522
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,680
let's,

523
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,270
let's get this going again back
made it a podcast at the same time.

524
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,210
Yeah, that's probably true. I think it
would actually probably be more fun.

525
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,180
You guys would be wearing headsets and
shit and talking to Micah and you would

526
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:04,920
know that other people are going to be
giggling and enjoying it along with you.

527
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:07,370
It might be the way to go.
I've never played this game,

528
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,780
so explain to me how it goes.

529
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,590
Uh,
have you ever played anything

530
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,190
similar? Did you ever get
no fantasy games? Although
I was huge on fantasy books.

531
00:29:16,191 --> 00:29:19,370
I was big Robert, he Howard
fan as a kid and I, you know,

532
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:23,030
love just getting into fantasy football
or fantasy. No. Cause I knew that

533
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,750
different from that because
they don't really, you don't
get together and, but um,

534
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,040
it's basically you create a character.
Will you,

535
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,070
I'm sure you've played like a,
what do they call those games?

536
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,440
The video games that are,

537
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,970
what's that called? More role playing
RPG. Yeah. Never those you never play

538
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,840
play first person
shooters. Yeah, me too. I,

539
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:48,220
I played and I could cut legends and a
couple of things like that and I just

540
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:51,490
couldn't get into it because I like
playing role playing with my friends,

541
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:56,260
but doing the video game, it's, it's
too slow moving. Like I much prefer, uh,

542
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:01,180
you know, first person shooters around
just [inaudible] and even in vi, even in,

543
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,970
um, dungeons and dragons,
I was always the guy.

544
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:08,440
Like I played dumb characters and it's
like I'm the guy that runs through the

545
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:11,980
door first swing in the battle
ax. You know, just kidding.

546
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,400
I'm that guy.
I watched John The guy like,

547
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,780
oh I've got to figure out my spell and
I've got to say this incantation and I've

548
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:23,620
got to have these runes in my hand and
I've got to do all these things to get

549
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:24,730
this one thing to work.

550
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:29,110
I was the guy like I pick up my hammer
and I smashed you in the fucking head.

551
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,430
You know it was that guy.

552
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,050
I sat down with Dunkin once.

553
00:30:32,051 --> 00:30:35,920
When you try to explain to
me the compelling magic of
world of Warcraft and we

554
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:39,610
went through a little journey and he met
up with some people and I was like sat

555
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:43,330
over his shoulder. I was like what the
fuck are you doing man? This is so stupid.

556
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,430
Never got it.
I'm like let's go play quick.

557
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:47,890
I'll show you how many
people I can kill and a time,

558
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,330
the time that this has happened I would
have killed 30 or 40 people or brains

559
00:30:51,331 --> 00:30:55,870
work the same way. I just can't do that.
Yeah. Cause I knew, I knew what it was.

560
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,650
Cause I know it's close to
what I've played with d and d,

561
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:04,600
But d and d is much more fun for me
because of you've got the camaraderie and

562
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:06,400
you've got the friends and,
and uh,

563
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,190
did you ever have a landlord? Do you
ever play video games on a landlord?

564
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,310
That's what I was saying. Yeah.
I did the Halo Halo land parties.

565
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,450
I got addicted to video games because
of news radio because the writers,

566
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:20,410
the writers room where they had a land
party, so that was in there quick to yeah,

567
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,770
they would play quake to fuck.
It was so much fun. It was crazy.

568
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:27,370
It was so addictive. We would like,
uh, I'd go up there in between scenes,

569
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:28,660
like say if I didn't have two scenes,

570
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,190
I'd go up there and play
with some of the writers.

571
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:33,220
We'd be screaming each other talking shit
to each other. And it was so much fun.

572
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,400
After it was over, it on my hands would
be shaking and I'd go back to the set.

573
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:40,720
Like I was on crank, you know, I
went up there a couple of times. Uh,

574
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,390
who was her friends with that was on
that staff was alley against. Yes. Yes.

575
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,060
Al Higginson,
Joshua [inaudible] and uh,

576
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,010
went there a couple of times and got to
hang out. So what a crazy set that was.

577
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,050
That that was the weirdest writing room.

578
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,440
[inaudible] didn't they start like
at nine o'clock at night they started

579
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:59,110
whatever the fuck they want
it to. It wasn't, they start
at nine o'clock at night,

580
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:00,820
sometimes they didn't start
until two o'clock in the morning.

581
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,130
They just want the writing
room works like that. Like,

582
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,670
and it was basically a bunch of guys that
nobody had kids at that you couldn't,

583
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,170
you couldn't.

584
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:11,230
And people that you know that like had
kids and they knew not to even apply for

585
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:13,060
the job but get everybody started.

586
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:16,360
Like they would like sometimes he wouldn't
even start writing until the morning

587
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,930
and we would get there and then like an
hour later it was first Bot would pull

588
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:23,050
it out his guitar and start dicking
around in his guitar. Right.

589
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,790
Cause they were so they were
brilliant but complete children,

590
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,540
like some of the smartest guys
I've ever met. But we would like,

591
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,730
we would get there,
say it was a nine o'clock table read,

592
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:32,620
we'd get there at 9:00 AM.
It's usually later than that,

593
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:36,340
but if it was 9:00 AM we would get there
and we would have to wait 40 minutes

594
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:37,210
for the first script.

595
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,150
The first script we'll all we would
get as a chapter and so they'd be like

596
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:43,610
blocked this chapter and the next chapters
will be coming in a couple of hours

597
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:45,530
and then they would write
the chapters literally,

598
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,980
but they liked the pressure comes don't
work like that. No, of course not.

599
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,560
I did a guest spot on your
Sitcom and just shoot me

600
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,720
and it was remarkably well behaved, but
it was the way they did. It was brilliant.

601
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,461
All had kids.

602
00:32:58,461 --> 00:33:01,640
They were there till eight or nine o'clock
at night and then they went home to

603
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:05,930
news radio. Guys figured out a way
to force themselves to be funny.

604
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,350
They figured out a way to put themselves
under a lot of pressure and that that

605
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:13,340
really funny stuff would come with sleep
deprivation and with a lot of pressure.

606
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,790
I mean it's a, it's a method. It's
not the best method. It's a method.

607
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:19,460
But the funniest shows I ever
worked on it. I just fucking

608
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,380
what? I love to have been there
all the time. Like you, but yeah,

609
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,180
just those two episodes I did.

610
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,970
Yeah, those scripts were
really fun. So much fun.

611
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,600
It was such a pleasure to be on it.

612
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,450
And I got so lucky because I can't write
a show. No, it was on another show.

613
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:38,290
I went from the worst show possible to
the best show. It's called hardball.

614
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:42,250
It was a baseball show. Ahh. It should
been funny. It was written by funny guys,

615
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:45,160
Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran who wrote
from married with children and they wrote

616
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:49,810
on the Simpsons there was a great
guys. Yes. And uh, when they got on TV,

617
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:53,380
when the show got picked up, they, they,
fox the network came along and said,

618
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:55,540
listen, you guys can't run your own show.
You know what the fuck you're doing.

619
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,580
So we're going to bring in
the worst hack we can find.

620
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,880
And they brought in this guy from coach,
I don't remember his fucking name,

621
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:04,840
but every joke was horrific.
It was terrible. He got fired,

622
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:08,380
but they couldn't pull it out of the out
of the flames. It was just, it just died.

623
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,020
We eventually had that.
It just shoot me the final season.

624
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:14,590
We jumped the shark like they changed all
the writers and the new guys that came

625
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:18,760
in were a total accident. That last
season was miserable. It's the worst.

626
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,970
People don't know how bad it is to do a
bad show. Like everybody comes and says,

627
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,560
oh, woe is me, Charlie sheen make it $2
million a year. It's true. You're right.

628
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:27,640
He should not be complaining.

629
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:29,860
No one who makes $2 million
a week should be complaining,

630
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:33,730
but there's a reason that fucking guy lost
his marbles. I watched that show once,

631
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:37,330
just recently. The first time
it's unfucking bearably bad.

632
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,080
It's unbelievably unbearably bad.

633
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:44,770
I like it because of how bad it is. Like
A, and I haven't watched a bunch of them,

634
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:49,300
but I've watched a handful of them
and it's like, oh, okay, this guy,

635
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,840
all these jokes are about,
he fucks a lot and the other guy's gay,

636
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,340
like that's all the jokes are.

637
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:58,120
It's him making fun of crier for
being kind of Wimpy, you know?

638
00:34:58,121 --> 00:34:59,560
So it's all these gay jokes.

639
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:04,240
And then the fat lady walks in and says
other mean gay jokes and jokes about

640
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,030
Charlie Sheen fucking all the time.
That's all it is.

641
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,830
It's one of the worst shows that's
ever existed. I just like the opening,

642
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,700
that transformation or the kid.
That's all. I can never saw that part.

643
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:18,180
But it's just, it's amazing that it's
so popular. It's fucking incredible.

644
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:23,460
Is it amazing? Yes. It's still amazing
to me. It's still shocking. But you know,

645
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,600
when I find out that 51% of the country's
still thinks the earth is less than

646
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:30,060
10,000 years old,
that's like a recent Gallup poll.

647
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,390
When I find out shit
like that, it's, it's,

648
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,120
it's fucking disappointing and it's
confusing. But you're amazed by it. Yeah,

649
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:39,960
a little bit. Still, it's
still around anymore. I mean,

650
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:44,070
I'm not surprised in the movies that
are popular in the music that's popular,

651
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,130
you know?
And,

652
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,590
and the fact that the funny smart stuff
doesn't last because people don't care

653
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:53,010
and people are stupid. You know,
the numbers though are monstrous.

654
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,030
The numbers of stupid people are just so,
but I'm not surprised by that.

655
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,480
I wouldn't say I'm surprised. I
would say I'm shocked. I'm like,

656
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:03,780
God damn it really. You know? I would
wish that it wouldn't be like right.

657
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:05,620
You've got to want to shake everybody.
Yeah.

658
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,500
It's just wish it wouldn't be the
way studio is like good stuff.

659
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,900
Well you know what's wrong with you?

660
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,040
It's the big question is to how long
people can stay stupid, you know,

661
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:17,490
because he's,

662
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,210
technology gets more and more complicated
and more interesting and more,

663
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,450
I mean your,
your life has run connected to technology.

664
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:28,870
It's pretty easy to be stupid. You Google
anything, you find the answers, you know,

665
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,390
if you don't want to believe reality,

666
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:32,790
you find a message board of a bunch
of other people that believe the same

667
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:37,020
bullshit you believe and just
ride it to the apocalypse.

668
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,060
It's easy as fuck to be done today.
Oh for sure. He's here than ever.

669
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,160
So anyway, my, my,

670
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,880
I was in the worst case scenario from
that show and then all the sudden best

671
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:50,130
case scenario for news radio.
So I've never done it.

672
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:54,030
So can say like when you showed
up, like did you like, no,

673
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:55,920
like when did you know
you're on a great show?

674
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,370
Oh I knew it was great when I saw
the pilot, I wasn't in the pilot.

675
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,420
Fortunately I got to watch the pilot.
There was another guy in place,

676
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,000
well Ray Romano was the
original guy who had my part.

677
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,210
He got fired and they brought in another
guy who did the pilot and then don't

678
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:15,420
get fired cause it can act or, um, I just
think that he was wrong for the part.

679
00:37:15,421 --> 00:37:17,790
I think they just wanted someone
different. They wanted to do it different.

680
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,640
So they decided to get rid of Ray Romano.
And of course Ray Romano,

681
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,550
there's the greatest thing that ever
happened to him cause it goes on.

682
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,010
Does everybody knows and it
makes $1 trillion. But they, um,

683
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,340
they did it and then they brought in
another guy for the pilot and then he got

684
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:34,170
fired. And then they had some sort of a,
a thing, you know, and open call thing.

685
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,580
And, uh, I had a development deal with
NBC to do my own show. I just got it.

686
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:40,750
And then they said,
before we even talked to you about that,

687
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:43,050
and we went to Montreal or something,
or no,

688
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,710
I got it after I did the
hardball thing. Okay. It failed,

689
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,130
but I got to deal somehow or another,
I got good agents,

690
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:50,900
so you're still doing a ton of stand up.

691
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,550
I kept telling him I was
always doing stand up. Um, so,

692
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:58,380
and then I went to NBC and they
showed me the pilot and then, uh,

693
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,480
you know, they said, would you be
willing to audition for this? And I said,

694
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:04,650
fuck yeah. And then I auditioned and I
got it. It was really just stupid luck,

695
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,660
but I knew right away, it was
amazing. You know, right away,

696
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:11,220
the first day at table read, I'm sitting
next to Phil Hartman. I'm like, Holy Shit.

697
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,820
Like I knew Dave Foley was famous,
but I didn't know of him. I didn't,

698
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:17,310
but it wasn't really a
true fan. No, I really,

699
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:19,470
I did see a couple of sketches
that I thought were kind of funny,

700
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:20,820
but it wasn't like really into it,

701
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,580
but it just sitting next to Phil
Hartman at the table, it was like,

702
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:24,990
this is fucking bizarre.

703
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,710
And then were you a fan of his from
Simpsons and you know, I'm just seeing,

704
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:29,491
I mean it was hilarious.

705
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:31,620
I remember seeing him on TV
and thinking how funny he was.

706
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:34,350
And then all of a sudden I'm sitting
next to him on a TV show when I had never

707
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:36,070
taken a fucking acting class in my

708
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,400
life. And it was like six
months from doing this MTV,

709
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:42,880
half hour comedy hour and then boom,
six months later, somehow or another,

710
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:46,100
I'm living in La on a sitcom.
It was completely pissed off pretty fast.

711
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:50,620
Ridiculously fast. I remember meaning
you around then the first time.

712
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:53,320
I don't know if you remember meeting me
cause I remember you being on the set.

713
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,640
No, no. Before that we did busters. Happy
hour together. Oh Shit. I remember that.

714
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:02,050
Blau I forgot that buster Poindexter
the guy from Hanson? Yeah,

715
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:05,950
from New York though. Yes. To this
shitty character, that hot hot, hot song.

716
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:10,240
I remember, I remember when he
busted. Yeah, it's a made up guy.

717
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,800
How weird that he did that?
What am,

718
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:16,150
I mean we had this weird that he did
not give a shit about at all. Yeah.

719
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:18,010
You hosted,
what network was that on?

720
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:22,930
I just want to say VH one or like how
many TVs? If it was comedy central,

721
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:26,920
I'd be surprised. I think, well, comedy
central used to be before comedy channel,

722
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:32,200
maybe Buster's happy hour. Oh
Wow. Dave Raf booked it. Wow.

723
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:37,120
Yeah. So that's how, who else did it with
us? I feel like it was you, me and Janine,

724
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:38,860
but I could be wrong.
I don't think so.

725
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,550
I don't think I've ever done anything
with this graph. I don't know. But uh,

726
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,620
she knew what it was.
If there was like,

727
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,290
I think they taped several
episodes in one day.

728
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,440
I remember a couple of people
being behind, uh, or you know,

729
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:52,840
be in backstage while we were
there. Oh, right, right, right.

730
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:55,570
And they splice them all together.
And I had never met you before.

731
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:57,100
I never seen your standup before.

732
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,820
And I was doing like kind
of the alternative thing
and you brought a stool out

733
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,800
and like, dude, you're fucking this
thing. I did the tiger fucking bit.

734
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,700
Is that what it was?
Most of my clothes,

735
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,340
that was the first time he did me.

736
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,900
I don't even think we met
like I think it was just like,

737
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,540
oh that's one of the other
guys I'm doing this show with.

738
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:20,770
But does that still
fucking guys? Yeah, it's a,

739
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,530
and then we did, uh, I loved the show.

740
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,210
I love news radio and
watch it the whole time.

741
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:29,950
And I think I probably got brought
on my first one and yeah, no,

742
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:33,190
they were both near the end.
How many seasons did you do?

743
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,660
Did you do the Phil Hartman Year or low?
Was it? Love it. So I didn't do love.

744
00:40:36,661 --> 00:40:39,160
It's at all I did to
fill episodes. I did, uh,

745
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,390
the one where we were the
acapella singing group. Oh yeah.

746
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,030
He wanted to beat me up cause I kept,

747
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,950
I kept the eyeball and yet that
was so fun. It was fun. It was fun.

748
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,960
They always had the most
ridiculous premises,

749
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,900
like space news radio where
we did the whole news radio,

750
00:40:55,901 --> 00:41:00,600
but it was in space or titanic news radio.
We'll just ship.

751
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,950
Yeah,
it's fucking completely ridiculous.

752
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,490
We were the singing group that tries to
get Dave to come back cause we're all

753
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:10,660
about to turn 40, I think. But we,

754
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:15,661
and it was Kirk and me and cross and we
all come on and try to get them to join

755
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:20,160
this group up with this again to,
it's such a joke.

756
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,700
So yeah, that was, I mean, that's why
I've never done another sitcom sense.

757
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,420
Everything I've looked at since it's like,

758
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:32,410
that's why I don't write for sketch shows.
Mr Show did that ruin that for me?

759
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:34,160
Like when you, right,
a good one or you work

760
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,820
on a good job, like one of the best
versions of that kind of thing.

761
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,620
Like why do you ever want to go back,
you know,

762
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,600
have you considered doing a podcast? I
am. Yeah. I'm going to do one with the,

763
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:47,910
you know, Earwolf uh, it's Scott
Aukerman started it up, uh,

764
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,980
comedy death ray guys and, and
uh, he's a good buddy of mine.

765
00:41:51,981 --> 00:41:56,510
He was mister show writer. So
I just figured I, you know,

766
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:01,100
now even though I'm more clearheaded,
I'm not that motivated.

767
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:04,700
Like I need somebody to ha like set it
up for me and for you to have a regular

768
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:06,800
place to go.
Like for me to do it at my house,

769
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,990
I'd probably never get off
my ass and get it done.

770
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,720
So you can do it man. Look, you took
this huge step in stopping the weeds do,

771
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,000
you could do anything.
Now you know what you need to do.

772
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,550
This is the number one thing to
get things done. Write them down.

773
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,520
I write things down and when,

774
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,020
when I write down a bunch of
shit that I have to get done,

775
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:27,250
I make sure I do them because otherwise
they're just sort of a thought, you know,

776
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,820
if, if it's concrete, so I'm
a little PC, yellow legal pad.

777
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,920
I have to get all these things on this
list done. This is my day, you know,

778
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,030
you've been doing this now,
writing things down and podcast a year,

779
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:41,370
a little over a year,
year and a half to do it.

780
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,620
Or just as a goof, I was
depressed because, uh, came back,

781
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,350
I shouldn't say depressed, but I was
bored because I came back from Colorado.

782
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:50,800
Wa was forced to move back here
because, uh, my wife was pregnant,

783
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,810
she couldn't deal with the
altitude up there, right.

784
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,030
Cause we were like
literally in the mountains.

785
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:58,380
So we came back and a month later me and
Brian were sitting around and we were

786
00:42:58,381 --> 00:43:02,380
like, let's fucking do what Anthony
Anthony [inaudible] does on the OB.

787
00:43:02,381 --> 00:43:04,430
And Anthony show he gets
is it does a little, uh,

788
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:08,950
Ustream show live from the compound.
So we sat down with like a Webcam.

789
00:43:08,951 --> 00:43:12,340
That's what it started out when we had
like fucking snowflakes coming down while

790
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:13,770
we were talking like fake snowflakes.

791
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,050
I was like so stupid
and cheesy and you know,

792
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,920
half of the show was
just us reading Twitter.

793
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:20,980
Unlistenable if you tried to
listen to in iTunes, it's terrible.

794
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,220
And then somehow or another, everybody's
saying this was awesome, do it again.

795
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:26,500
We're like, all right fuckers,
we'll see you next Tuesday.

796
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,410
So we just all of a sudden started
doing it on a weekly basis.

797
00:43:29,411 --> 00:43:32,680
We started doing one way and we never
stopped. We just kept it up. You know,

798
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,130
the only time I took any time off of it
over a week and a half was recently I

799
00:43:36,131 --> 00:43:39,040
had to do a movie in Boston for two weeks.
So we took two weeks off.

800
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,670
And how long did it take you to like
decide on a format and that kind of thing?

801
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,520
We didn't decide on anything.

802
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,580
It just sort of evolve and he started
bringing guests in. All that. Yeah.

803
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:50,880
I mean we always had cats but it
was always like my closest friends.

804
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:51,750
It was always like,
you know,

805
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:55,260
Joey Diaz would come over or each fear
would come over here and then, you know,

806
00:43:55,261 --> 00:43:56,460
uh,
as time went on,

807
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:58,980
we eventually got like real
microphones like we have right now.

808
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:02,790
And was the guy that shows
his pulse on the, yeah, it's
done. The Manchester. Yeah.

809
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,180
Brian Posehn was there for the ill
fated attempts with demand shows. Well,

810
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,150
you were a faded of good stuff,

811
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:12,060
but it was still faded for
a couple of reasons. One,

812
00:44:12,061 --> 00:44:15,720
it was I should have never tried to do
something where I didn't have the time to

813
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:18,150
do it. I just did. Yeah,
you were pretty busy.

814
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,790
I was doing fear factor at the same time.
It was a ridiculous idea.

815
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,760
The idea that I could do to TV
shows it was doing the UFC. No,

816
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,810
sometimes it was signed to Vegas to do
fear factor, but that was pretty rare.

817
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:31,020
Most of the time it was done
in and around Los Angeles,

818
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,560
but I feel like we barely, we barely
had you in the room. It was too hard.

819
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:37,590
I would come in and I would only
have two days a week and it was,

820
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,130
and then there was all this infighting
going on him. It was a funny man.

821
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:43,740
Greg Fitzsimmons. Yes, and time
Janice running in the room.

822
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,910
A couple of other funny guys.

823
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,710
There was a lot of funniness and you and
and a standout brought your own funny

824
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:51,360
ideas to it.
We had an issue.

825
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:55,470
First of all in that as we started was
when the Janet Jackson Nipple thing went

826
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:59,760
down. You remember that shit?
That's when we got gutted.

827
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,640
They came in and said to kind of remember
like we had an abortion monologues.

828
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,630
Yeah, we had an abortion
monologue. It make it less massage.

829
00:45:08,631 --> 00:45:12,060
It didn't mean, no, not just
data, but less shocking.

830
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:17,430
They gutted it and then there was
also, there was, they had one direct,

831
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:20,250
we wanted to do a totally different thing
and the network wanted basically the

832
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:24,630
same. They kind of bullshitted me when
to get it. They said, Oh, do new to dean.

833
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:26,820
We'll blur it out.
Swear and will be bid out.

834
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:30,060
It'd be good if we got sued and
he showed his bomb. Yeah, he did,

835
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,070
but meanwhile I had a fight for that.
You know how much I had to fight for that?

836
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,930
Yeah. Zooey was fucking crying,
but Friedman's daughter,

837
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:39,840
she was crying because she didn't want
it to happen. I just don't see why.

838
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,740
It's funny. I go, there's nothing you can
do in life that's funny than this. I go,

839
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,010
just watch. I go, we'll do two openings,
we'll do one with it and one without it.

840
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,720
So we did and he,

841
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:53,400
Joey gets out there and the place goes
fucking bananas because he's 350 pounds

842
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:57,830
and he's got, he looks like he ate
another human being and his stomach.

843
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,380
And it's hard to even see his
balls when he's a big guy.

844
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:05,860
Well his balls or shit goes down.
There's balls like grapefruits,

845
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,870
there's a lot of charm.
He's a lot of scars and shit,

846
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:12,120
but his balls are like
grapefruit and it old ladies,

847
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:15,990
panty hose next to this
uncircumcised monster,

848
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:20,250
elephant trunk Dick. And he's out there
screaming, let's get this party started.

849
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,700
And he introduces me and Doug and that's
a great way to start off the show.

850
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:27,000
And I thought what a fun thing would be
to have Joey on the show every week to

851
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:29,400
start it off. Just like, why is this
funny? I don't understand why. It's funny.

852
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:34,800
It's funny. It just is funny. You can't
look, you guys are the executives.

853
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:37,590
I'm sure you have your own tastes,
you have your own hopes and dreams,

854
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:40,500
but you know, creatively, you
can't second guess artists.

855
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:42,900
You have to either let them
do it and if it doesn't work,

856
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,640
then you come in and make corrections.

857
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,010
But you can't say it from the
get go that it's not funny.

858
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,260
You gotta you gotta let,
let,

859
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,610
let us play it out in front of an
audience if we think it's funny,

860
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:53,820
chances are right. The one thing, like
when the writer's strike happened,

861
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:55,020
the writer's guild strike happened.

862
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:59,110
I always wished that one of the
things we would have asked for is, um,

863
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,700
we no longer have to take notes from
people that are less funny than us.

864
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:08,280
You know what I mean? I'm serious. Like
that's the big part that like cribs,

865
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:12,660
funny thing and hurts funny shows
is the unfunny people going, no,

866
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:15,090
I don't like, I don't get
that. Why are you doing that?

867
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:17,070
And I know it happens at other networks,

868
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:20,880
but I've run into it a lot
of comedy central because
I wound up there a lot over

869
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,250
the years. I did that show.
I did Sarah Silverman.

870
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:28,251
I've done other things that haven't even
made it on air because there's chimps

871
00:47:28,591 --> 00:47:30,280
that just don't get

872
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:35,140
what's funny and you know that they
have those job that they're basically

873
00:47:35,141 --> 00:47:39,970
allowed to, you know, be the gatekeepers
are funny and they're not fucking funny.

874
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,750
It's brutal. It's literally
like, and again it's, you know,

875
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:47,360
guys that get paid to be funny
complaining about, Oh, you know,

876
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,130
I don't get to do this.
Boohoo well,

877
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,360
it's not just that you're
complaining about a roadblock
and the creative process,

878
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:55,630
a real roadblock where someone
doesn't get the look you stand.

879
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:58,400
Could you imagine it? So
one of the beautiful things
about standup comedy is a,

880
00:47:58,401 --> 00:48:00,970
you are your own writer, director,
producer, the whole deal.

881
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:05,260
Could you imagine if you had a run your
material by a group of people before you

882
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:09,130
went on stage before you even went on
stage with it so it wouldn't even be

883
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:12,640
proven? Yeah, I've had that
too when I've done special,

884
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,670
when you do specials where it's
like, yeah, I've had that in the,

885
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:17,350
can you say this instead of that?

886
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:20,980
And my last special was the best
because I didn't have to do anything.

887
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:24,760
I did a spike TV when the spike and
comedy central, first of all it's blank.

888
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:27,280
And then comedy central.
It was the first one ever where they said,

889
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:28,490
just go ahead and do what you do.
Well,

890
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,000
we're worried about what we can and
can't do after the network season.

891
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,870
My next thing I'm going to do is going
to be for DVD first and then if anybody

892
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:37,990
wants to buy it and I'm fine,
that's the way to do it.

893
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:41,490
That's how I did my Netflix when
nobody gives me notes. Yeah. Cause the,

894
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,400
the two comedy central half hours I did
like I had to tweak words and change

895
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:49,170
where it's completely and if I call
the move jokes and you know, and,

896
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,280
and they wound up being
okay and I'm proud of him.

897
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,230
But it was also such a process and, and,
and uh, as a standup, like you said,

898
00:48:56,231 --> 00:48:59,260
we've never had to go through that.
Like, you know, and if you did,

899
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:03,460
it would be a design writing jokes for
24 years. And I never had anybody go, no,

900
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,360
you know, don't do this instead of that.
Well what's important about comedy?

901
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,660
One of the, to me when I, when I
go to see a comic, I don't even,

902
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:14,020
like when I hear the guys have writers
I feel like I feel like I'm getting

903
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:17,410
ripped off. I feel like I'm getting
lied to. I don't mind, you know,

904
00:49:17,411 --> 00:49:20,130
I mean some big name guys hire
writers and that's all good there.

905
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:21,730
The good writers and they
write some great beds.

906
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,690
But I really love when I go see a guy
and I know that this is a singular point

907
00:49:25,691 --> 00:49:28,720
of view. This is this guy's point of view.
This is him sitting down and writing.

908
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:32,590
I like him. I like, I want to see his
whole pack or her or whatever it is.

909
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:35,360
I want to see their whole
package from them. The one that,

910
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,600
the one guy that does
it right is Chris Rock.

911
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,130
He writes it all himself and then he has
somebody else go with him and you know,

912
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:45,400
cause he does those long sets and a lot
of it is like he hasn't written it out

913
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:49,270
first. So we had somebody, uh,
I think God, who's the guy,

914
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,460
the guy that used to show Mario Joiner,

915
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:55,090
I think it's Mario joining or sitting
in the audience watching and saying this

916
00:49:55,091 --> 00:49:56,050
worked.
That worked.

917
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,870
But it's not him going
Mario. Right. Me Jokes.

918
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,140
It's a consultant. Yeah. Which that works.

919
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:08,820
But these other guys that have
like a staff, and I won't name,

920
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:12,310
I want to name names either, but uh, I
knew a couple of guys that you think,

921
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,250
oh yeah, I think it, how's that guy
come up with an hour every year?

922
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,550
Because he's got three fucking
guys writing for them all the time.

923
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,260
But then there's guys like Louis C k
they don't have anybody writing for me.

924
00:50:21,261 --> 00:50:25,210
It still comes up with an hour every year.
That's incredible. He's a monster. Yeah,

925
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:28,040
he will. You know what it is.
There's something wrong. He's

926
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,720
got momentum behind them right now.
He's in a groove and he's,

927
00:50:30,721 --> 00:50:34,370
he's really and Co completely.
How against how it used to do it.

928
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:37,580
He used to do the same act for like
the longest time and now he's in this

929
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:40,430
completely new George
Carlin sort of a thing.

930
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,960
How long does it take
you to write an hour?

931
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:47,000
I did my last special almost two years
ago and I have about an hour and 30

932
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:50,270
minutes now, but I been
working a lot, you know,

933
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:53,930
I jumped right back into it and I had
a bunch of bits that I didn't do in the

934
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:57,080
special that it was still kind of fucking
around with, so I had a base to start.

935
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,140
The real hard hour is the third hour.

936
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,860
That's the hard hour if you do three
years in a row because the first year

937
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:06,620
you've probably been working on it for
a few years in the second year. Well,

938
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:09,320
if you've got a few premises that you
didn't really touch on within that third

939
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:11,300
year, man, you're starting
from fucking scratch son.

940
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:11,651
Yeah.

941
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:15,430
My first record came out six years ago
and then my last record came out last

942
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:17,350
year and I'm working on
the third one right now.

943
00:51:17,351 --> 00:51:21,140
And that's the one where I
basically started over, uh,

944
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,760
last March when it came out and it's a
year and I maybe have 25 that I love and

945
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:31,870
I'm still doing stuff from that other,
but I also had other things going on.

946
00:51:31,871 --> 00:51:34,930
And you know, what do you do when you do
the, do the road? Do you do some old shit?

947
00:51:34,931 --> 00:51:36,320
Some new shit? I do. It's,

948
00:51:36,321 --> 00:51:41,020
it's 45 to an hour and it's
like 25 brand new and, and, uh,

949
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:44,290
some other stuff from the last record,
which I can't wait to get rid of.

950
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:49,150
Do people ever get bummed out?
Shit online and stuff of people gone,

951
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,060
you know, you're not as prolific
as your friends and it's like,

952
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,720
well then fuck you my friends.

953
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,120
And if that's the worst is when you
get compared to those other guys.

954
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,770
And people compare me to Louis, uh, you
know, like, or bring Louie up of like,

955
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,830
why can't you do what Louis does? And I
don't know, my brain isn't wired like his,

956
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,390
I don't mind if a guy
does a few old jokes.

957
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:13,900
I like hearing some old bits that I
enjoyed, but I like a lot of new shit too.

958
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:17,800
I see their point. I've had a peep
places where I go and they'll say, hey,

959
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,920
this guy was here last year and he just
came back and he'd do the same fucking

960
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:23,090
ag verbatim punchline

961
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:24,150
like,
and I,

962
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:27,210
I make it like if I'm going back to
the same market that I was just out of,

963
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:31,500
here I go,
I go out of my way to write new stuff or,

964
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:33,660
or let them know. Even like, hey,

965
00:52:33,661 --> 00:52:37,170
here's some stuff you might've
heard and then here's, you
know. Right, right, right.

966
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,080
Yeah. I didn't even say in
the setup like my accident,

967
00:52:40,081 --> 00:52:43,740
a transitional period and this is, you
know, this is what's happening. And Yeah,

968
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:47,160
I do a lot of, uh, where it used
to at least I do a lot of Q and. A.

969
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,510
I did that for the
first time this weekend.

970
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,940
I did Vancouver now for the first
time this weekend for the first time.

971
00:52:50,941 --> 00:52:52,580
I've ever done a, um, an encore core,

972
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:57,290
you'll do an encore? No, I don't
think so. Never done that before.

973
00:52:57,291 --> 00:53:00,140
Maybe at a college. I feel it.
Yeah. I did have to come out.

974
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,610
I feel like in Alaska I came out and did
really like another joke that I hadn't

975
00:53:04,611 --> 00:53:09,080
done. What'd you do in Alaska? Uh, it
was a school up there, up in Anchorage.

976
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,520
Wow. What's it like up there? Is it weird?
It's fucking weird. And it wasn't the,

977
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,220
it wasn't the, in the middle of summer,
but it was the beginning of summer,

978
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:19,350
so it was a, it was
light till midnight. Why?

979
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,520
I flew in in the afternoon
and then flew home at night,

980
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,980
flew home right after my show.
So it got to the airport

981
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,240
around 11 o'clock at night,

982
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,130
just as it's starting to get dark
and it was really trippy. Wow. Yeah.

983
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,870
Alaska freaks me the fuck out,
man.

984
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:36,830
That's like the place where you go when
you're running from the world. Right.

985
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:41,280
You know, when you really want to be an
outcast. But yeah, that was the only time.

986
00:53:41,281 --> 00:53:43,650
So you did your first one and
yeah, it was weird. You know,

987
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:45,090
they just screaming encore,
encore.

988
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:48,900
I did an hour and hour and something
and then I went out and I did another 40

989
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:53,760
minutes. But it's all just, mostly I did
some material that I hadn't done before,

990
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,340
but a lot of it was just asking.
They would ask questions,

991
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,830
he's fucking around with the audience.
I used to do a lot of that,

992
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,510
but it became a lot of the same questions.

993
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:02,910
And I also felt like the
show didn't end it strong.

994
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,970
I like ending on a strong bit,
so I was doing like an hour.

995
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:09,780
I broke it down to what I feel like is
the best performance and it's like an

996
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:14,130
hour and 10 minutes going at it. Full
clip and strong. Thank you. Good night.

997
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:17,430
So I did that and then I came out and I
felt like, okay, this isn't even the show.

998
00:54:17,431 --> 00:54:21,030
This is just fucking around and this
is at least they've seen the full solid

999
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:24,120
show and now I can fuck around with like
the question and answer thing and it

1000
00:54:24,121 --> 00:54:27,120
didn't, I don't feel like I'm
ending on a bad note, I guess. Yeah.

1001
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,480
I ended strong luckily.
But when your ad living like that,

1002
00:54:30,481 --> 00:54:32,670
you don't really know where the
fuck is going to go and you don't,

1003
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,330
you got to trust the crowd, laugh.
Go all right. Yeah, exactly.

1004
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:39,290
And you've got to trust the crowd
and the crowd was fucking hammered.

1005
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,920
They were hammered and high as fuck.

1006
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:45,600
And the pot in Vancouver is insane.
It's just as good,

1007
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:49,070
if not better than California. I never
thought I would. I would say that. But we,

1008
00:54:49,071 --> 00:54:52,660
we got ahold of some stuff.
This guy messaged me and uh,

1009
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,710
we went to a dispensary, they have
dispensary's then and we went and uh,

1010
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,970
I'm just like, how good could this
be? We're, we're from California.

1011
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:05,540
We almost got too high to do the show.
Sativa and Indica or sativa. Yeah.

1012
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:09,510
One area still where you can kind of
score on the street to even sort of,

1013
00:55:09,511 --> 00:55:12,160
but I think that's dangerous.
I don't know. But the, the,

1014
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:15,600
the whole five of them in
Vancouver. Rob, do you mean?

1015
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:19,130
No,
just a Bot Bot decent stuff.

1016
00:55:19,131 --> 00:55:22,370
One day went back to the same guy the
next day and he told her or assaulted me

1017
00:55:22,371 --> 00:55:25,970
Schwag. Oh really? Yeah. Wow.
So it wasn't, he ripped off,

1018
00:55:25,971 --> 00:55:30,700
he just was shitty quality control. No,
it was barely smokeable. Oh really? Yeah.

1019
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:35,420
And I actually had a guy there once,
the same, uh, same city, uh, where, uh,

1020
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,010
he goes,
follow me.

1021
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,610
He just came up to me on the street
because you want it by the way. And I go,

1022
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,950
yeah, yeah, sure. Wow, that's
a better effect they do.

1023
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,680
And I followed him around
the corner and he goes, oh,

1024
00:55:45,681 --> 00:55:49,880
I got to go into this household on.
And as it, as it's happening, I'm like,

1025
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,350
there goes that 20 bucks.

1026
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,940
And I gave him the money and he went
inside and I actually saw him go out the

1027
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:59,810
side door and climb over a
fence, go away. Wow. Yes,

1028
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:04,790
I could see him run away my money and I'm
just laughing at that point. I'm like,

1029
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,560
ah, the I deserve it. You know?

1030
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,090
Well, they have a, Vancouver has a,

1031
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:12,360
they have a medical thing going on now
will they take recommendations from

1032
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:15,420
California? So if you have a license,
you have a California license,

1033
00:56:15,421 --> 00:56:17,960
they'll allow you to get a
prescription card, right? Yeah. Yeah.

1034
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,830
I never go up there. He
never did a legal, really,

1035
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:24,080
you're a rebel borough and now why
would you want to go to the dispensary

1036
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,970
is amazing. I know. Well, I just smoked
my friend's stuff from dispensary's,

1037
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:30,130
but I always had a weak
guy that came to my house.

1038
00:56:30,131 --> 00:56:34,750
Do you have a guy that come
no fucking way? No, no, no,
no, no, no. You, you, you.

1039
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:37,620
That's probably why he stopped smoking
weed. You were getting all that,

1040
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:41,230
that stone or we'd you weren't
getting it a space weed and you know,

1041
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:44,650
I wasn't getting less space. We'd with
space, we space suite is the, the,

1042
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,990
the sativa.
It's much more psychedelic.

1043
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:50,140
It's like you want to watch
space documentaries. We want
to go out and do things,

1044
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:53,920
I'm going to make an organic carton.
Right? You get no, you're right.

1045
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:56,540
And I was getting the same stuff cause
the guy always had to say, you know,

1046
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:01,660
he had the same buyer that you know, or
whatever. When you go to a dispensary,

1047
00:57:01,661 --> 00:57:04,120
then they educate you on it. That's
the beautiful thing of it. They'll say,

1048
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:08,500
this is a hybrid. This is a little bit
of this. This is 60% indigo, 40% sativa.

1049
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:12,430
This is a pure sativa. This is gonna. You
want to write a book? This is your shit.

1050
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,550
Right. You know, it's, it's a different
feeling. Yeah, I gotta check it out.

1051
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:17,650
But when I have that, when
you're done, if you do,

1052
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:20,920
if you decide to ever do it again,
that should be the thing.

1053
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:24,880
But what are the reasons I kept this guy
is he was my friend and I talked to him

1054
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:29,170
a couple of years ago. I swear to God
we're were in my garage, uh, you know,

1055
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:32,590
or the transactions done and we're,
I'm rolling what up, you know,

1056
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:36,340
before he heads back to where he
lives. And, and, uh, I go, uh,

1057
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,120
this is one of the economies
first starting to go south.
I go, hey dude, if I,

1058
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:44,080
if I stopped buying from you because
I was thinking about getting a card,

1059
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:46,750
you know, and I'm like, if I stopped
buying from you, would you take a hit?

1060
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:51,070
You know, like, would it hurt
you financially? He's like,
oh, absolutely. He's like,

1061
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,800
yeah, you're one of my regulars. And,
and uh, yeah, that would suck him.

1062
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,630
So I then I was like, ah, I'm going
to keep the little guy in business.

1063
00:57:58,631 --> 00:58:02,800
I got to look out for the small
businessman. Well that's cool.

1064
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:06,650
That's a good reason to, to keep with
that guy then not get a license. That is,

1065
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:10,390
he was my old friend. I mean he was a
guy. I'd been through wrath and, and uh,

1066
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,460
we've been,
you know,

1067
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:14,890
I think at that point wrath was getting
weeded somewhere else or, but uh,

1068
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:19,180
I used him anyway, you know, I kept
him for 10 years or so. That's good.

1069
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:21,250
And weird thing is, and I'm going
to write a joke about it. Like,

1070
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,780
I haven't told him that I quit yet and
I know it's three months later and he

1071
00:58:25,781 --> 00:58:29,960
hasn't gotten a text for
me. Like he hasn't texted me
like, what the fuck can we,

1072
00:58:29,961 --> 00:58:34,060
are you? Oh, that's funny. Maybe you heard
about it online and he's just crying.

1073
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,590
Just know he's recalculating as bills.
Trying to figure it out,

1074
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:41,110
how he's going to get by when that you're
paid rent and two months now because

1075
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:44,110
the fuck, yeah, it's a,

1076
00:58:44,111 --> 00:58:47,530
it's amazing how many people are in
California smoke pot now. You know?

1077
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:49,000
Because it's so,
it's so prevalent.

1078
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:52,360
People in other parts of the country
really haven't, they don't have a clue.

1079
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:56,220
You don't have any idea how bizarre it is.
You know when you go,

1080
00:58:56,530 --> 00:59:00,130
if you go to Kansas City and he'd do a
club in Kansas City had tried get in pot,

1081
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,830
it's fucking hard and if you get
pods and I'm going to be any good,

1082
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,790
it's going to be okay.

1083
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,850
When you're in California and you just
drive down the street and you see these

1084
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:10,930
green plus signs everywhere,
you see him all over the place.

1085
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:15,250
There's hundreds of dispensary's. He'd
been to San Francisco later. Oakland? No,

1086
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,400
I haven't been to Oakland, but I have
a buddy of mine who grows in Oakland.

1087
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:22,720
It's a while. It's totally allowed
up there. Yeah. You'll stand up,

1088
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,580
you know cobb's uh,

1089
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:28,730
the comedy club in San Francisco and
this never was like this when I lived up

1090
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:33,200
there in the 90s were standing in front
of the place and one of the main streets

1091
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:35,360
in San Francisco,
cops drive by,

1092
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:38,390
there's eight people standing
out front smoking pot, you know,

1093
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:41,540
three or four pipes being passed around.
The cops don't even slow down.

1094
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:45,020
And even though Carlos and say,
hey, take it around the corner,

1095
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:48,860
they don't do any of that. They thought
should be last time I was at cabs,

1096
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:51,470
I was smoking in the green room and
I was passing joints out the window.

1097
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,930
[inaudible] handed them
joints rather. Yeah. Yeah.

1098
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:01,270
That San Francisco is totally allowed.
But that whole city now is, yeah.

1099
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:04,760
In Oakland and I haven't
told is even more extreme.

1100
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:07,100
Like they called Oaksterdam
that. Yeah. Well,

1101
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:09,680
they also have classes on how
you can grow and you know,

1102
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:11,150
how do you consider your own business?
Yeah,

1103
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:15,110
they have like some fucking
university of weed up there.

1104
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,870
I don't even know exactly what this weird,

1105
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,500
there's some place in this country or
is it Vancouver where they're actually

1106
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:25,680
selling it at seven 11 south.
What really? Come on. Yeah,

1107
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,610
I heard that just recently.
That

1108
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:34,180
one or two places where now it's
allowed like in one store to two K.

1109
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:39,620
Awesome. That's cool. I heard
that seminar could be, this is

1110
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:46,640
what I heard. Yeah, sure. Um,

1111
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:50,930
pulls up nothing for
Google pulls up nothing.

1112
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,410
So I'm assuming this is
bullshit. Okay, good.

1113
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:58,160
But I think we're close if that's
happening. But they'd be crazy not to.

1114
01:00:58,161 --> 01:01:01,190
Why not man? Just fucking jumped
in. You know, what do you,

1115
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,630
what do you know who's getting hurt here?

1116
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:06,510
You're already selling loco for 20
or whatever the fuck that shit is.

1117
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,890
What does that four Loko Shit stuff
that people have their heart bursts.

1118
01:01:09,891 --> 01:01:13,250
It's like five red bulls and
five shot. It was, it's Tequila.

1119
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,270
It's whatever the fuck it is.

1120
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:19,271
Some strong alcohol and like really
strong red bull type energy drinks.

1121
01:01:19,461 --> 01:01:23,030
People are dying of it. Yeah.
They sell that. They sell
cigarettes, they sell booze.

1122
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,920
You know, you saw everything. They
can kill you. I sell a little weed.

1123
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:30,260
How long do you think that's going to
be before that happens? 10 years. 20.

1124
01:01:30,261 --> 01:01:32,320
I don't know.
I think we're closer than that really.

1125
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:35,990
That felt like that last election we
were really close to get sloppy and it's

1126
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:39,580
just the next time somebody
writes the right bill and,

1127
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:43,880
and words that in the right way that
gets even that last people to go, hey,

1128
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:46,490
that's not a bad idea.
The real issue though is federal.

1129
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:49,940
The federal issue is a huge issue
because it federally, it's still very,

1130
01:01:49,941 --> 01:01:54,200
very illegal. It's still schedule
one, which is a huge deal. That's a,

1131
01:01:54,201 --> 01:01:57,650
that's heroin. That's cocaine.
It's uh, not, not even, excuse me.

1132
01:01:57,651 --> 01:02:01,350
Those are scheduled to schedule one
is more illegal than cocaine. Right.

1133
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,310
But there are a lot of cities around the
country that are starting to, you know,

1134
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:07,920
yeah. I know. It's basically illegal.
Uh, you know, like I was saying,

1135
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:11,750
it was shooting this thing in Ann
Arbor. It's pretty okay there. Yeah.

1136
01:02:11,751 --> 01:02:14,420
And arbors really? Okay. Yeah,
that's pretty legal there.

1137
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:18,080
I think they just approved medical
in Michigan as well. And um,

1138
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:21,660
where was I recently though? It's really,
oh, Denver. Denver is super legal.

1139
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:24,690
Denver is a lot like California.
They call it mainstream. Damn.

1140
01:02:24,691 --> 01:02:29,691
They got like one street main street or
broad stir dam and it's all pot shops.

1141
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:32,060
Josh blue.
Like there's yes.

1142
01:02:32,061 --> 01:02:36,620
Some comic that Joshua was the guy who
has cerebral palsy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1143
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:39,660
But um, yeah, it's, it
means starting to happen.

1144
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:41,250
Starting to happen slowly but surely.

1145
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:46,550
And I was listening to rock radio in
Detroit practically every ad on this

1146
01:02:46,891 --> 01:02:51,400
regular rock radio station is
either a gro growth, you know,

1147
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:54,000
go new grow store or you know,

1148
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:58,500
an actual medical marijuana store
really like almost every ad. Holy Shit.

1149
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:02,520
That's cool. Wow. But then again, who the
fuck's listening to radio these tests?

1150
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:05,130
That's true.
But I had a rental car and you know,

1151
01:03:05,131 --> 01:03:08,970
and they played a thin Lizzy and
Metallica. So Nice was enough for me.

1152
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:13,260
You ever see the documentary wild to
ocean wild ocean? What does, I don't know.

1153
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:17,440
It's, it's as bad as I saw it last
night and it's all about sardines and,

1154
01:03:17,441 --> 01:03:22,180
and like they do that thing were birds
do where they all become one group,

1155
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:26,150
like a mob to like a flock of birds
where they move in one unit. Yeah,

1156
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,440
it's so bad ass.

1157
01:03:27,441 --> 01:03:31,270
But they have it in three d and the
three d TV thing in the past, you know,

1158
01:03:31,271 --> 01:03:33,250
like I said,
it's good for here and there and stuff.

1159
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:36,970
This is the most amazing thing
you'll ever see in three d.

1160
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:41,650
It's just this huge mob. Like all
these fish turned into like a monster,

1161
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,360
like a boss battle in a video game.

1162
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:46,960
You see these dolphins just trying to
shoot through them and get it and they all

1163
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:48,610
kind of react as one whole.

1164
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,440
And then there's the seagull things that
dive down and go through the water like

1165
01:03:53,441 --> 01:03:57,340
missiles and it looks like underneath
the water it looks like war.

1166
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,730
Like it sounds like war,
like missiles and bombs and an,

1167
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:04,570
it's the most amazing thing.
Everyone's birds do. They dive bomb.

1168
01:04:04,571 --> 01:04:08,740
They're are like muscles. Yeah. Must be
crazy in three days. Three body recommend.

1169
01:04:08,741 --> 01:04:12,940
It's called wild ocean. It's the ocean.
It's so bad ass. All right Max. Uh,

1170
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,600
speaking of, see, I watched
the sativa before, that's it.

1171
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,400
Watched a, a, a documentary.

1172
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:23,100
Somebody linked it to me on Twitter
about the Salton Sea. Do you,

1173
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:26,130
do you know anything about the
salt and sea? A little bit.

1174
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,980
This is a trippy thing man.
And I was not aware of,

1175
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:31,950
I remember there was an invalid,
I don't know. It's in California.

1176
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:36,570
There was a val Kilmer movie
about salt and sea. It was
like, you know, some crime.

1177
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:41,610
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Well,
what it is is apparently at
the turn of the century they,

1178
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,090
um,

1179
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:47,090
there was an engineering mistake and the
Colorado River for two years was just

1180
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,480
dumping water into this one part of
California and they thought that it was

1181
01:04:53,551 --> 01:04:56,550
going to dry up and they thought
that, well, this is a huge mistake.

1182
01:04:56,551 --> 01:05:00,210
It created the biggest manmade lake
in California, the biggest lake,

1183
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:03,660
the biggest bottle of body of water
in California is the salt and sea.

1184
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,040
And it filled this whole area up and
they thought it was going to drain out,

1185
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:09,960
eventually dry up,
but it didn't.

1186
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:14,490
And people were putting boats on it and
people started building houses there and

1187
01:05:14,491 --> 01:05:15,840
people started fishing in there.

1188
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:18,390
And then they started having tourism
there and they started there.

1189
01:05:18,391 --> 01:05:22,060
They're just commercials move to the,
the, the Riviera in California, the end,

1190
01:05:22,061 --> 01:05:25,930
you know, the, uh, the, the, you know,
indoor Riviera or the Interior Riviera,

1191
01:05:25,931 --> 01:05:27,220
I forget what they were calling it,
but it was,

1192
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:32,430
it was this gigantic artificial body of
water and people were pulling all these

1193
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:35,220
fish out and it looked like a
fucking party. And it was, you know,

1194
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:38,620
it was like photos and video from the
fifties where everybody was like driving

1195
01:05:38,621 --> 01:05:41,770
those old cars and they're all smiling.
And the women looked a little Chubby,

1196
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,950
you know, it was a whole, the whole,
the whole, that whole era. Well, well,

1197
01:05:44,951 --> 01:05:49,951
eventually the runoff from all of these
farms made it into this see and poisoned

1198
01:05:51,071 --> 01:05:55,180
everything and got so bad that there
was mass Fishkill offs where there was a

1199
01:05:55,181 --> 01:05:56,950
million fish would die in a day.

1200
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:00,640
And the air was so rank with dead
fish that you couldn't breathe.

1201
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:05,760
So it basically became this toxic fucking
cesspool and everyone had to move out.

1202
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,910
All the schools shut down.
Everyone moved down to the area.

1203
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:13,660
And there's only like a few like desert
rats that are still living there.

1204
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:17,680
But try it out though, right? No, no,
no, no, no, no, no. Still. Oh yeah.

1205
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:19,390
Now it's saltier than the ocean.

1206
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,670
Now it's like impossible
for things to live in it.

1207
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:23,740
I think it was just like the salt flats.

1208
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:29,290
Now it's a dead like butter puddle of
water and it's all like the apocalypse out

1209
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:32,980
there bad because all these houses
that are like being overcome by this C,

1210
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,240
they're all rotted out from the salt
water and the air and the fucking,

1211
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:41,200
everything's abandoned. And windows of
Grogan. It's called the s the documentary.

1212
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,300
Um, let me find it. It's cause
it's on my, it's on Netflix. Yeah,

1213
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:49,480
it's on,
you can find it on youtube.

1214
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,520
Let me find the video on youtube
because it's, it's, it's,

1215
01:06:52,521 --> 01:06:54,710
it's fascinating enough to,
people need to see it.

1216
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:58,930
If you just go last night to my Twitter,
if you want to do some searching.

1217
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:04,470
Today is June 13th and you go to the June
13th Twitter cause I'm trying to pull

1218
01:07:04,631 --> 01:07:07,920
it up here on 'em online
and it's pulling on

1219
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:13,200
not a documentary. It's kind of,
I think it came out no six but uh,

1220
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:17,740
into the void. Do you ever see it?
Oh yeah. It's amazing. Yeah. Yeah.

1221
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,770
At least the first half of it is,
I,

1222
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:24,890
I did you get pissed off with all the
strobe lights and all the fast motion.

1223
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:28,320
We'll do tell everybody with this
documentary as well. Oh wait,

1224
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:31,770
I'm thinking of enter the void. You know,
you're thinking of that movie on Dmt.

1225
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,900
Yeah. He's talking about, it's like a
skateboarding movie, right? No, no. It's,

1226
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,860
maybe I'm getting the title wrong,
but it's a,

1227
01:07:36,861 --> 01:07:40,280
it's the two guys a mountain
climbing, uh, where uh,

1228
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:44,160
one guy breaks his leg
and they're alone and uh,

1229
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:48,660
he basically lets us friend die or he
thinks he like, I won't give it all away.

1230
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,260
He lets the guy go and then,
you know,

1231
01:07:52,261 --> 01:07:56,130
then it's told like buy them.
And then with the reenactments,

1232
01:07:56,430 --> 01:08:00,150
the reenactments are brutal and uh,
it's just really well made.

1233
01:08:00,151 --> 01:08:04,410
It's these two British guys that were a
climbing a mountain and a that had never

1234
01:08:04,411 --> 01:08:08,320
been, never been done before. It's called
the engine into the void. The void.

1235
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,450
Yeah. And I was thinking to enter
the void. Yeah, I remember that.

1236
01:08:12,451 --> 01:08:16,370
See I just saw this kind of movies
stress me. Yeah. I, Oh yeah.

1237
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:19,380
It was wondering was I
watched it in two sittings.

1238
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:23,840
I had to walk away and get something else
done cause I was like so stressed out

1239
01:08:23,841 --> 01:08:27,920
for these guys. Yeah. But you know that
the fact that they're both talking,

1240
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:31,490
you know how it ends up,
right. So yes, it's still,

1241
01:08:31,491 --> 01:08:33,770
it seems like the only
soften the blow a little bit.

1242
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:38,720
I didn't see that movie where they got
cut his arm off either based on that guy

1243
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:44,270
or a hundred, 127 hours. Yeah. Not
really interested in seeing that. Thanks.

1244
01:08:44,271 --> 01:08:48,650
That's pretty brutal. That was why I
made too. Yeah. I love Netflix streaming.

1245
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,000
I mean,
how great is that nowadays?

1246
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:53,090
You can just stream these
documentaries like instantly

1247
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:57,600
do something particularly scary about
the idea of getting stuck out in the

1248
01:08:57,601 --> 01:08:59,160
wilderness and dying out there,

1249
01:08:59,161 --> 01:09:02,850
away from civilization cause
you're so unprotected and we're so,

1250
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,760
we're so not aware of how
unprotected we really,

1251
01:09:05,761 --> 01:09:09,870
are you one of those goals that even
does those things? I lived in Colorado,

1252
01:09:09,871 --> 01:09:12,210
in the mountains.
I lived eight miles down a dirt road.

1253
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,680
My dog had eaten by a mountain lion.

1254
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:16,710
It's one of the reasons why we
decided to move back. But yeah,

1255
01:09:16,711 --> 01:09:20,310
I decided to just throw myself out
into the wilderness and wanted to be,

1256
01:09:20,311 --> 01:09:22,650
you know, I wanted to be
somewhere. It was let way, way,

1257
01:09:22,651 --> 01:09:24,840
way less people and just
kind of like take it all in,

1258
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:27,330
but you're really fucking vulnerable.

1259
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:27,860
Yeah.

1260
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:32,340
But I would never be mountain climbing
one other data and I w I'd never be like

1261
01:09:32,341 --> 01:09:35,250
this movie frozen. I really liked. Did
you see that and haven't seen that.

1262
01:09:35,251 --> 01:09:37,940
It's a harm with three
kids on a ski lift and uh,

1263
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,440
the ski lift gets shut down
at the end of the night.

1264
01:09:40,441 --> 01:09:44,550
And then they're stuck over there for the
weekend. Like I'm just not adventurous.

1265
01:09:44,551 --> 01:09:46,320
I wouldn't be that guy.
I wouldn't be that guy.

1266
01:09:46,321 --> 01:09:50,170
Like we got to get one last run in I
think. Okay. I Youtube never been that

1267
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:54,720
do on youtube. It's called the
accidental. See and you you have to,

1268
01:09:54,721 --> 01:09:57,570
it's really quick too.
It's only like six minutes and 30 seconds.

1269
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:01,080
We're details the whole a thing of the,
the salt and sea.

1270
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:05,400
I said there isn't a full documentary
that I think there might be more than one

1271
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:06,091
out there.
There's a,

1272
01:10:06,091 --> 01:10:09,130
there's a couple of the people when I
posted this as a couple of the people a

1273
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,160
recommended on Twitter that
were different than this one,

1274
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,860
but this pretty much tells the whole
story in six and a half minutes.

1275
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:18,570
It's insane. It's insane.
It's, I mean it's, it's, it
literally looks like Mad Max.

1276
01:10:18,571 --> 01:10:21,050
I mean it's, it's the craziest shit
ever. What part of California is it?

1277
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:25,030
Is it someone that desert? Wow. Is it
like on your way out to Phoenix or mm,

1278
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:27,900
that's a good question. I don't know the
exact one we could find out right here.

1279
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:32,510
Hold on. Yeah, off the 10 or the 60 year.
I loved that abandoned kind of like ha,

1280
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:36,040
like neighborhoods and cities that,
that kind of feeling of like,

1281
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:40,360
like post apocalyptic Zombie of any time
you like that in real life, you know.

1282
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:44,060
I do. I like like a cat lives kinda. Yeah.

1283
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:47,340
As a kid we used to break into
the old prison in Columbus, Ohio.

1284
01:10:47,341 --> 01:10:50,280
We would break into it and smoke weed
and stuff like that and we were like 14

1285
01:10:50,281 --> 01:10:53,490
and that was just so cool to me.
But just the history of the,

1286
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:58,050
there's deteriorating building and
that visitor Detroit is fucking huge.

1287
01:10:58,051 --> 01:11:02,100
Those buildings or this thing,
she didn't enjoy the sir. It's,

1288
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:06,720
it's 220 fucking six feet
deep salt and see, wow,

1289
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:09,520
this is crazy. I got to
watch that tonight. Yeah.

1290
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:14,780
The deepest part of the C is five meters
higher or five feet higher than uh,

1291
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,600
yeah, five feet higher than the
lowest point of death valley.

1292
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:23,550
See is fed by the new Whitewater and
Alamo rivers. It's still fed. Wow.

1293
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:26,150
It's crazy. They diverted
it. They fucked up.

1294
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:31,110
It was just an engineering mistake and
it created this crazy fucking spot.

1295
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:32,550
But it um,

1296
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:37,890
it occupies the lowest elevations of the
salt and sink and the Colorado desert

1297
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,670
of the imperial and Riverside counties
in southern California. Riverside. Okay.

1298
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:45,900
Yeah. I need to go out and check that
out man. We need to make a fucking trip.

1299
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:48,500
We need to do a podcast from out
there. Yeah, that'd be interesting.

1300
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:50,730
It's worth the price
stinks. Like dude, there's,

1301
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:55,380
there's ground up dead bones
from fish that up sand.

1302
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,071
Okay.

1303
01:11:56,071 --> 01:12:00,480
There's so many difish died that there
is a type of Sam there that is nothing

1304
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:04,310
but ground up fish bones and they were
showing it in this documentary with her.

1305
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:05,161
It looks like Sam,

1306
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:07,560
the guy's reaching into the sand and
pulling it up and it's ground up.

1307
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:11,670
Fishbowls Dan helped spin out there.
It's where drink that water.

1308
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:13,040
It's probably thinking
about buying a trailer,

1309
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,240
cargo there for four days in a row,

1310
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:19,200
waiting for the end of time with the
fish sand the giant carton of cigarettes.

1311
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:24,770
If you ever swam with
dolphins, no. Yes you can.

1312
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:27,600
I was,
when I was in the big island of Hawaii,

1313
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,300
the dolphins were out near,
uh,

1314
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:33,150
people like people would go out and swim
with them and the dolphins would come

1315
01:12:33,151 --> 01:12:36,870
close to him. That's what I want to do.
Yeah, dude, you can go in Hawaii, there's,

1316
01:12:36,871 --> 01:12:39,570
there's parts of, uh, different
parts of the world were dolphins,

1317
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,860
dolphins love people.
Man.

1318
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:44,130
It's kind of crazy because they're
pretty brutal though. The dolphins,

1319
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:44,641
there's this,

1320
01:12:44,641 --> 01:12:48,900
a resort on a Wahoo Kahala where
they actually have dolphins captive,

1321
01:12:48,901 --> 01:12:50,190
but you know,
you can,

1322
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:55,080
they take you into the pool
with them and the capital. Yeah.

1323
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,900
Which is kind of a bummer.
[inaudible] me out, dude.

1324
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:03,260
That freaks me out what I want. Then
you see how intelligent they are. Yeah,

1325
01:13:03,261 --> 01:13:04,710
they are.
We call them a lot of puppies.

1326
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:08,340
Me and my wife there because
they are just like, Doug's,

1327
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:11,790
it really sweet though. They're like
dogs, but they're a lot smarter.

1328
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:14,880
They rape you to
love rape.

1329
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:19,890
Everyone needs to rape a little bit.
If you don't have any hands, you know,

1330
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,900
they have flippers.
You can't just rely on someone's kindness.

1331
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:27,770
Is there one rapey dolphin or are they
pretty be like, they're all eager?

1332
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:31,710
Gangbanging couple like one of them
like, Hey, look over there that,

1333
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:35,190
that you look and then the other one
comes in and dolphins are particularly

1334
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:38,100
ruthless when it comes to breeding
females because breeding females,

1335
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:38,940
when they have babies,

1336
01:13:38,941 --> 01:13:41,850
they won't mate for a bunch of years
afterwards while the kids growing up.

1337
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,720
So male dolphins will kill the babies
to force the women to fuck again.

1338
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:49,620
So one of those, yeah, people
don't tell you about that.

1339
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:52,880
When they tell you how low
dolphins are green, they're eco.

1340
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,010
I'll tell you how fucking
ruthless nature is. I mean,

1341
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,280
dolphins are not separate from
it. They uh, well, so the,

1342
01:13:59,281 --> 01:14:01,800
they'll kill babies to
force the female to breed.

1343
01:14:01,801 --> 01:14:04,710
So fucking bite their
heads off to kill him.

1344
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:09,310
They don't use guns right now.
They start to break the name.

1345
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:13,570
Yeah. So they, um, they'll kill the
babies and last they fuck the female.

1346
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:16,300
So because of that, the
females, fuck everyone.

1347
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,140
The females try to fuck as many men
as they can in their little pack.

1348
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,450
So that way when,
when it all goes down,

1349
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:25,450
you know the guy comes around and goes
down and this might be my fucking kids.

1350
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:27,550
I don't want to kill this chick.
And so they don't,

1351
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,870
they don't kill the babies
to force you to read. Yeah.

1352
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,290
Fucking loved. I was so stoned last
night. I was like thinking, man,

1353
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:37,280
dolphins seems so intelligent and they
seem like they all like communicate and

1354
01:14:37,281 --> 01:14:37,820
stuff like that.

1355
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:41,000
I want to take a dolphin and put it in
a big aquarium and they just take it on

1356
01:14:41,001 --> 01:14:43,580
land and show them like the sites
of the land. Cause know dolphins.

1357
01:14:43,581 --> 01:14:45,290
Dumb nine maybe it would help them out.

1358
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,760
Take a dog in New York City, get
super, super well. They're really,

1359
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:55,650
they're nearly close to being
able to the grove dolphin.

1360
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,170
It's really nice out though.
This is silver lake.

1361
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:01,360
They're really close to
being able to decipher.

1362
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:04,270
They're really close to being able to
decipher it. Dolphin language. Right.

1363
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:07,060
You know what I mean? It's something
that we're really unsure of right now.

1364
01:15:07,061 --> 01:15:08,170
What they're doing,
what they're saying.

1365
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:10,900
But it's going to come a point where
they're going to have some incredible

1366
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:14,140
supercomputer that's going to be able to
decipher though cause they have a very

1367
01:15:14,141 --> 01:15:17,140
clear language and once we figured out
their language then you know this is

1368
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:20,700
going to be like Google, translate,
pray, pray, pray, pray, pray,

1369
01:15:20,701 --> 01:15:24,010
pray and a bunch of racist
shit at eight eight Jews.

1370
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:29,920
The first dolphin is the out. That's
his first words. I hate Jews. Fuck man,

1371
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:32,830
we worked so hard for this.
Dolphins are assholes.

1372
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:38,740
Like if you had a killer whale in a fish
tank and he gave him a marker and he

1373
01:15:38,741 --> 01:15:42,430
came back in a swat stickers all over
the walls. Like fuck man. Really?

1374
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:46,730
Let's see. I think there should be more
experimentation on animals like that.

1375
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:49,930
Like I showed last night when I was
watching the movie, I showed my cat 3-d,

1376
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,141
you know,

1377
01:15:50,141 --> 01:15:53,440
I tried to place that that glass is this
cause it's never been done properly.

1378
01:15:53,441 --> 01:15:56,610
People don't show their cats 3d
never know. Maybe the cap freak out.

1379
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:59,790
I agree with some experimentation,
but I don't agree with,

1380
01:15:59,791 --> 01:16:03,090
I don't agree with any dolphin
captivity that might as well be jail.

1381
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:06,050
Those are slaves and those are
intelligent slaves. That's,

1382
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:07,920
they don't want to be there.
That's gross.

1383
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:11,210
The killer whale thing that's
gross kind of bummed out by the,

1384
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,780
by the dolphins at the Nice hotel,

1385
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:17,580
they probably switching at a four
star hotels matter, man. They want to,

1386
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:21,990
they don't,
they don't know what's on their pillows.

1387
01:16:21,991 --> 01:16:26,750
The Room Service 24 hours. It's
a nice, nice set up. You know,

1388
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,690
we have to be,

1389
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,900
this is what we have to think about for
real and it sounds hippy space talk,

1390
01:16:30,901 --> 01:16:35,100
but we have to really be concerned with
the way we treat less or animals because

1391
01:16:35,101 --> 01:16:37,740
that's exactly what the way
there seems to be an ethic.

1392
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,800
It seems to be every fucking
animal that's intelligent.

1393
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:45,210
We'll take the animal
that's least intelligent and
either fuck it or eat it and

1394
01:16:45,211 --> 01:16:48,600
that's, that's how it goes. That's
just how it goes with killer whales.

1395
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:51,420
That's how it goes with dolphins.
That's how it goes with people.

1396
01:16:51,421 --> 01:16:54,330
We're the top of the food chain.
So we take the things below us,

1397
01:16:54,331 --> 01:16:57,390
like killer whales and dolphins. We treat
him like shit. We put them in prison,

1398
01:16:57,391 --> 01:16:58,230
we fuck with them,

1399
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,290
we killed them in tuna that's accidentally
and nobody goes to jail for that.

1400
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:04,770
And then you think about what whales
or what work is due to whales.

1401
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:08,790
Killer whales are called killer
whales because they kill whales.

1402
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:11,690
They go after whales and you
bite it is fucking horrible.

1403
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:16,580
Video of Orca is biting Wales faces off.
I mean literally just taking,

1404
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:20,810
just swimming and taking huge chunks
out of these poor defenseless, you know,

1405
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:24,200
peaceful whales fingernails.
Yeah. Nerd whales, whales.

1406
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,320
And then we know about chimpanzees would,
a chimpanzee is doing,

1407
01:17:27,321 --> 01:17:30,950
they find monkeys, they eat them, they
tear monkeys apart and eat him alive.

1408
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:34,730
You know? So that's the intelligent life
that we've documented on this planet.

1409
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:36,710
And every single one of
them either fucks are,

1410
01:17:36,711 --> 01:17:40,820
kills everything that it can control
also to away. Exactly. So do we.

1411
01:17:40,821 --> 01:17:43,820
So we have to be real careful saying
that I'm really cool with, you know,

1412
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:48,320
animal experimentation. Because if some
new thing fucking lands here from Nibiru,

1413
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:50,810
you know, and it goes, oh,
you guys are stupid as fuck,

1414
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:52,310
you're still using the nuclear power.

1415
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:55,910
Oh you guys have cell phones and retires
just start killing and eating hippies.

1416
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:00,740
Right. When I moved to
Boulder, I saw that point.

1417
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:06,140
That's what I really truly understood
the hate for hippies faces off and rape

1418
01:18:06,141 --> 01:18:06,960
them and eat them.

1419
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,480
The last south park was so
awkward on if you saw it,

1420
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:10,560
you'd got to watch it though.

1421
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:14,100
It's about getting old and it was
one that was so weird, right? No,

1422
01:18:14,101 --> 01:18:15,000
I didn't say it was great.

1423
01:18:15,001 --> 01:18:17,820
I'm just saying it was so weird that I
haven't seen south park and have such a

1424
01:18:17,821 --> 01:18:21,390
long way to go to south park studios.
Watch the latest one. It's freaky man.

1425
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:23,400
The first couple of the season.
We're not great now.

1426
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:28,520
Felt like, oh, they finally hit on a
really great idea and they executed it.

1427
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:32,950
You want to talk about prolific, who is
more prolific than those guys are insane.

1428
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,740
Incredible.
And apparently it's all Trey Parker.

1429
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:38,740
Matt stone is a huge
part of it is as well.

1430
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:41,620
But Trey Parker guys and alien
and they have consultants,

1431
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:46,010
the guys that come in and
basically go, that's awesome.
Do that, you know, like the,

1432
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:49,110
and then they get a paycheck for,
for talent. Trey, how awesome he is.

1433
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:52,190
Yeah. I got to sit in one of
my friend now works there.

1434
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:55,540
He's that main editor guy and I got to
sit down on the couch once and you know,

1435
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:59,180
like hanging out with Matt stone and
talking and stuff. It kind of relax. They,

1436
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:03,010
once Trey came in, it was
just this intense energy
and everybody was just like,

1437
01:19:03,011 --> 01:19:07,330
okay, everyone's got to go. And you know,
it's so weird. He's, he's a maniac man.

1438
01:19:07,331 --> 01:19:11,070
I mean positive. I mean
I love him, but he's a,

1439
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:15,070
he's really a hard worker and
you think you have to be that guy

1440
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:18,440
day like during season three,
like in the beginning. And uh,

1441
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:21,060
it was really impressed by
just the way that guy runs,

1442
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:24,300
the fact that they were writing episodes,
but you know,

1443
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:27,390
for comedy central and they were allowed
to kind of do anything they wanted

1444
01:19:27,391 --> 01:19:30,330
there. And I don't know if a lot of
people that watch the show know that,

1445
01:19:30,331 --> 01:19:33,390
but the way they kept so like you know,

1446
01:19:33,391 --> 01:19:37,140
ahead of stories as they were
writing shit the day you saw it,

1447
01:19:37,141 --> 01:19:39,210
sometimes you know,
they were,

1448
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:44,070
they were rewriting and then it's on
air that night with the animation,

1449
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:47,570
you know, nobody else does.
That's incredible. They are.

1450
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:49,920
That's like how then do
we know when, uh, uh,

1451
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:51,690
Ileane consultants when
that thing happened,

1452
01:19:51,691 --> 01:19:54,720
they had an episode that day
about it and then Terry Shave, oh,

1453
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:58,880
there was stuff about it
and it was insane. Like no
other show does that. Well,

1454
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:03,570
especially animation Simpson's you read
a joke and a year later it makes it to

1455
01:20:03,571 --> 01:20:04,760
TV, you know? Yeah,

1456
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,490
yeah. That's a, they're pretty incredible
man. What done is a, an amazing thing.

1457
01:20:08,491 --> 01:20:09,271
And not just what that,

1458
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,760
but they're fucking movies and apparently
there are new play isn't saying can we

1459
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:16,530
see it? I'm hearing amazing thing. I
heard it's the same soundtracks out now.

1460
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,800
Did you ever see in the more
I'm an episode they did. Yeah.

1461
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:23,340
They did a half hour on the show about
Mormonism. And it was really funny.

1462
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:25,190
He does a lot of more men's
stuff cause I think he's,

1463
01:20:25,191 --> 01:20:28,020
he grew up in that movie gas.

1464
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:31,080
They've tackled pretty much every
religion on that show by now. But yeah,

1465
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:34,680
there are more men. So they
grew up in evergreen, Colorado,

1466
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:37,530
which is a pretty religious area.
That's why South Park,

1467
01:20:37,531 --> 01:20:41,310
south pus sorta based on evergreen.
I went to evergreen.

1468
01:20:41,311 --> 01:20:43,290
I looked at houses up there.
So it's interesting.

1469
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:47,140
It's like a lot of rich people from
Denver. Columbine, is it up there? No,

1470
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,920
not quite. It's like near
Golden. Okay. Like that area.

1471
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:53,280
It's a suburb of Denver and
it's really nice up there.

1472
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,650
It's beautiful houses and incredible view.

1473
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:59,400
I mean it's just you got to deal
with some snow, but my fucking God,

1474
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:01,880
it's gorgeous up there. Yeah, but there's
a lot of religious people up there.

1475
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:04,950
A lot of churches, a lot of it's
like very different than boulder.

1476
01:21:04,951 --> 01:21:08,700
We looked at boulder and boulder was like
all hippies and intellectuals and then

1477
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:13,380
evergreen was more like real right wing
and a lot of Jesus bangers up there,

1478
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:18,450
which is a lot of Colorado, Colorado
Springs. All Jesus bangers like that.

1479
01:21:18,451 --> 01:21:22,770
Colorado Springs was hippies near
Colorado springs is a military town.

1480
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:24,840
Colorado Springs is a,

1481
01:21:24,841 --> 01:21:28,770
it's a military is like the big industry
out there and that's where Ted Haggard

1482
01:21:28,771 --> 01:21:32,780
was from.
The Guy who was the gay Minister II,

1483
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:38,280
which um, you know, it's uh, it's, it's
interesting man. How many people uh,

1484
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:42,870
get in trouble with their dicks
in, in 2011. This, this latest one,

1485
01:21:42,871 --> 01:21:44,010
this Anthony Wiener guy.

1486
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:47,610
If you seen the photos of him sending
photos of his dick from the congressional

1487
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:52,470
bathroom or the Congressional Jim, he's
only congressional anymore. Oh yeah, yeah,

1488
01:21:52,471 --> 01:21:55,650
yeah. In the, in the bathroom of
the Congressional Jim in the land,

1489
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:56,460
the locker room.

1490
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:59,940
He's taken a camera for cell phone photo
of him naked holding onto his cock.

1491
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,630
Nice cock. And his name's
Dina. So it's pretty cool.

1492
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:06,360
Decent kind of take a lot more
pictures of my cock is bigger.

1493
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,810
Would you send them randomly
to Twitter people though? Yeah,

1494
01:22:09,811 --> 01:22:13,320
I'd probably put them up on my Facebook.
Yeah, we'll look at what he did today.

1495
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:17,190
This guy, I think it's fascinating
that he's not Hancock at the grove.

1496
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:20,640
We would see the x men today.
Here he is.

1497
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:23,910
I think it's cool that he's not
quitting. Yeah. But why shitty? I mean,

1498
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:28,020
everyone fucking, who cares.
Yeah. He's just, he's a freak.

1499
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:31,200
But yeah. How was that affecting
his ability to, you know,

1500
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:34,830
to dictate policy or to do whatever
the fuck he has to do in his job?

1501
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:38,370
You know what I mean? It, it compromises
people's ability to take them seriously,

1502
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:42,420
I guess. But yeah, which ultimately
hurts us, I think. I guess so.

1503
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:45,130
But the only reason why anybody wants
to be a politician in the first place is

1504
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:47,430
because they, they want
power. That's just a fact.

1505
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,420
There's so very few of those
people really, truly want
to help anybody. You know?

1506
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:56,450
I think the obligation is so overwhelming
that to really want to do it,

1507
01:22:56,641 --> 01:22:57,570
just to help people.

1508
01:22:57,571 --> 01:23:00,180
I think people get into it and then
it's just too much and they just fucking

1509
01:23:00,181 --> 01:23:01,950
fuck, this is too, too crazy.

1510
01:23:01,951 --> 01:23:05,100
There's a few Ron Paul's that I really
believe are actually trying to make

1511
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,150
things right,
but for the most part,

1512
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,950
so many of the people
that are in that position,

1513
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:11,800
they're just trying to fucking pump
themselves up. But as a Democrat,

1514
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:15,650
when stuff like that happens,
I always feel like, you
know, Chris Rock and the, uh,

1515
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,470
whenever a black guy gets in trouble
joke, you know, like, oh great, thanks.

1516
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,310
Right. You know what I mean?
As a adding that to us.

1517
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:26,830
Do you really believe in being a democrat?
Do you think that's real?

1518
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:30,540
Do, yeah. I mean, I,
I vote that party yet.

1519
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:34,820
Even though all this fucking Obama
Shit hasn't changed anything.

1520
01:23:34,821 --> 01:23:39,790
And in fact he's been more conservative
and I am done more. He's basically Bush,

1521
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:44,180
Bush black, you know, he's almost done
exactly the same thing. Didn't close.

1522
01:23:44,181 --> 01:23:47,120
They'd gone down the way that's
gone. But I mean, come on.

1523
01:23:47,121 --> 01:23:49,340
He didn't close Guantanamo
Bay. He didn't, you know,

1524
01:23:49,341 --> 01:23:53,270
he said that he was going to close the
wars and public and he's sent 30,000 more

1525
01:23:53,271 --> 01:23:57,980
people to Afghanistan after he won the
Nobel prize. I mean, it's all insanity.

1526
01:23:58,370 --> 01:24:00,350
It's all insanity. It's,
it's the idea that,

1527
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:03,620
that somehow or another Democrats
operate any different than Republicans.

1528
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:07,940
It's all horseshit libertarian.
Well, you know, I voted for Obama,

1529
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,540
but I did it just because I thought it
was a historic milestone and I was hoping

1530
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:14,720
socially that it would make a big change
and it would be different. Yeah. I mean,

1531
01:24:14,721 --> 01:24:17,030
I guess maybe it has,
but you know,

1532
01:24:17,031 --> 01:24:20,750
and this whole fucking Osama bin
Ladin nonsense, they killed him. Not,

1533
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:22,880
but we threw him in the
water. Yeah. It's all done.

1534
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:27,150
Oh yeah. And a week after the, it had
like the lowest point, right? Yeah.

1535
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:31,810
And you know, and he was talking about
that in a speech recently and he said,

1536
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,150
you know,
that it's proof that did this,

1537
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:36,010
this administration is on the right track.

1538
01:24:36,011 --> 01:24:39,010
You need look no further than the fact
that we got rid of public enemy number

1539
01:24:39,011 --> 01:24:40,960
one, Osama bin Laden. And I'm like, wow,

1540
01:24:40,961 --> 01:24:43,120
that is the craziest fucking
thing I've ever heard in my life.

1541
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:44,840
Because what does that got done lately?
Oh,

1542
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:48,820
was just a bad guy you were looking for.
You fucked this economy inside out.

1543
01:24:48,821 --> 01:24:53,020
It's asshole is prolapsed and hanging out,
bleeding all over the sand.

1544
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:57,340
And you're saying that, you know, and it's
not him, but it's the whole system has,

1545
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,230
it has not been repaired.
In fact,

1546
01:24:59,231 --> 01:25:02,230
there's millions of dollars and billions
of dollars that they can't account for

1547
01:25:02,231 --> 01:25:05,440
in this fucking bail out. They don't know
where the fuck it went. And you know,

1548
01:25:05,441 --> 01:25:07,270
there's all sorts of
shenanigans have gone on.

1549
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:11,560
So to have this guy say that that's how
it's proof that it's all back in order

1550
01:25:11,561 --> 01:25:15,040
that they've killed this number one
bad guy like Jesus fucking Christ.

1551
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:19,270
What are you think I'm a little
kid? Like that's, you know, I don't,

1552
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:21,880
I don't believe in him anymore than
I believe in any of the other ones.

1553
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:23,200
I don't think he's a bad person.

1554
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:26,740
I just think that is the job you get
there and then they give you a script and

1555
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:28,870
you don't really get much
fucking saying what happens.

1556
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:33,900
I think we have this really a distorted
perception of what a president is and

1557
01:25:33,941 --> 01:25:36,490
it's based on like the ideal
of like President Kennedy,

1558
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:40,090
the I the guy who's going to step in and
put this country on the right track and

1559
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,710
you know,
and look what happened to him.

1560
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:44,980
And I think that that is the
thing you don't remember.

1561
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,510
I think that's what happens
when there's a guy who uh,

1562
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:55,330
some happen to magic TMZ was
around when Kennedy was here.

1563
01:25:55,870 --> 01:25:59,380
Awesome. I'm like, God, I want to see
us going to get rid of Twitter updates.

1564
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:03,710
He'd be popping bottles with models every
night like rose sex tape. I'm alone.

1565
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,960
Could you imagine how ridiculous of a B?

1566
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:08,870
Cause he would just be partying and
people be pulling out their cell phones.

1567
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:13,640
Put that down.
Please try to keep America free over here.

1568
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:19,400
He just be bitches and champagne and Frank
Sinatra high five and whether fucking

1569
01:26:19,401 --> 01:26:23,750
69 and chicks. Awesome. Yeah, it would
be a different world man. You know,

1570
01:26:23,751 --> 01:26:27,530
now it's like fucking every week over
the airport you see these dudes just

1571
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:32,000
scanning for someone famous to show up
with cameras. Do you see them? Yeah.

1572
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:35,240
You know, I know when they're
talking to me, times are tough

1573
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:40,290
pulling me, you know, you, you, you,
what do you think of reality shows today?

1574
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:44,360
Ben was, yeah, I have a question.
Is that I think they're awesome.

1575
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:48,230
You watched American idol. So
we think about that guy, man.

1576
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:53,060
The guy didn't go in at all. What's,
what's your favorite housewife show?

1577
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:58,460
I go with New Jersey cause they're
the most savage who are the closest to

1578
01:26:58,461 --> 01:27:02,390
animals. I can't watch that shit.
Yeah, you can. If you do it once,

1579
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:06,450
it's all you need one, one, one.

1580
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:12,290
Yeah. I don't think it's the best move.
It's not a good move to get drawn in.

1581
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:15,360
It's some the grand distraction.
Unfortunately. I watch it like

1582
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:18,860
some of them and she hates that when
I walk into the room and I, you know,

1583
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,780
I start scoffing or shaking my head like
the other night she made me leave the

1584
01:27:22,781 --> 01:27:26,620
room she was watching,
which we'll show in New York and uh,

1585
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:31,150
they were arguing about some girl being
late for dinner and I was just like,

1586
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:34,970
what the fuck? How can you watch
this? You're a smart girl. I'm like,

1587
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,400
you're well read.
Did you like good things?

1588
01:27:38,401 --> 01:27:42,630
Like why are you watching these
fucking idiots? It's entertaining.

1589
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:47,490
It stimulates some weird part of the
mind and it does provide some sort of a

1590
01:27:47,491 --> 01:27:47,941
relief.

1591
01:27:47,941 --> 01:27:52,530
And the relief is that you're allowed
to get invested in these people's lives.

1592
01:27:52,531 --> 01:27:54,090
We have no stakes whatsoever.

1593
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:57,870
So this fucking bitch is yelling
at her husband and wow that guy.

1594
01:27:57,871 --> 01:28:01,890
Well he is a piece of shit and she does
have a point and you get caught up in

1595
01:28:01,891 --> 01:28:05,880
these and it's a distraction from your
own real live situation and your real

1596
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:09,020
life problems that you need to
deal with. Yes, that's what it is.

1597
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:12,600
Can't get my head. I would never want
to watch your show to con shopping.

1598
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:18,030
Shopping would be number one on the
fucking the twat network and no time.

1599
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:23,340
Um, I spent a lot of time on the message
boards, man. And I'm, I'm amazed at a,

1600
01:28:23,341 --> 01:28:26,730
and I've gotten to know a lot of people
on message boards and I'm amazed at the

1601
01:28:26,731 --> 01:28:31,731
energy that people will put into
concocting arguments on the Internet.

1602
01:28:31,771 --> 01:28:36,771
And like having like debates and putting
things in quotes and citing exams.

1603
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:42,410
They put so much work into it yet I
know that their life is in a shambles.

1604
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,180
Right.
I know cause they're going broke.

1605
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:48,000
I know that that they might
be losing their fucking house.

1606
01:28:48,001 --> 01:28:51,020
They might be in the middle of a
divorce, they might be fucking, you know,

1607
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:55,410
losing their job and yet here they
are spending an immense amount of time

1608
01:28:55,411 --> 01:29:00,411
arguing a sport or arguing about a
movie or a song or a band and you know,

1609
01:29:00,901 --> 01:29:01,980
and fucking with or

1610
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,120
talking about you. Do you read, do you
read the critical stuff about you or,

1611
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:08,730
I read some of it, you know, I know
it's really, really negative. I mean,

1612
01:29:08,731 --> 01:29:10,770
I see where the comedy just
fucking door in a fire. Okay.

1613
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:13,710
I'm not going to listen to you. This
is silliness, you know, but you can,

1614
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:16,140
I think you can get
some things from people.

1615
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:20,910
I'm a big proponent of reading critical
things because for two reasons. One,

1616
01:29:20,911 --> 01:29:23,850
because I think it's like snake venom.
I think if you don't,

1617
01:29:23,851 --> 01:29:26,220
if you're not used to it and all sudden
you read some shitty about you, like,

1618
01:29:26,221 --> 01:29:30,660
Whoa, that hurts. I feel shitty. But
I see it so much. It's like, you know,

1619
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:34,470
the snake bites here. I'm like, bitch,
I'm not immune to this shit. I mean,

1620
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:38,640
I read that a lot where people say
stuff about me and it's like, really?

1621
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:41,250
You're calling me a Yeti and that
I looked like a child molester.

1622
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:45,540
I say that in my app.
Oh.

1623
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:49,240
And I look like a muppet.
Never heard that. Uh,

1624
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:54,120
fucking think of something new mean to
say about me because I've said every

1625
01:29:54,121 --> 01:29:57,630
possible horrible about myself and my act.
When you're a comic,

1626
01:29:57,631 --> 01:30:00,420
you can't catch a comic off guard.
Like we know what we look like.

1627
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:05,580
You're not going to get us like that.
But when they'll say like critical shit,

1628
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:07,530
it's always to me like super fascinating.

1629
01:30:07,531 --> 01:30:10,170
Like what are you trying to achieve
there and why are you so upset about

1630
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:13,420
someone's art? You know, someone's
comedy, someone's offering.

1631
01:30:13,421 --> 01:30:16,200
It's like I have friends that will like,
fuck Larry,

1632
01:30:16,201 --> 01:30:20,640
the cable guy's fucking the Axa and I go
blah blah blah blah blah. Who cares man,

1633
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,560
do you, does it really affect you? Does
it really bother you? You know, it does.

1634
01:30:25,561 --> 01:30:27,210
Like when you did the Carlos thing,
you were,

1635
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:32,130
you were sticking up for a friend that
had been right sticking up for the whole

1636
01:30:32,131 --> 01:30:36,170
art form too, where people don't
understand about that whole situation.

1637
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:40,060
It was like creativity was under siege.
We had a terrible situation,

1638
01:30:40,061 --> 01:30:42,660
but guy was getting away with
stealing shit left and right.

1639
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,630
But I don't give a fuck if he was doing
it as, oh shit. If it wasn't good.

1640
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:47,490
But there's been other guys where people,

1641
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,120
like when people were first thrown
Dana under the bus, I was like,

1642
01:30:51,121 --> 01:30:52,350
it's not affecting me.

1643
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:56,100
Ryan and I are not going up for the same
auditions and he's not taking food out

1644
01:30:56,101 --> 01:31:00,120
of my mouth by him being a fucking unfunny
hack, you know, I can't watch his act,

1645
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:03,090
but it's not hurting me. You
know what I mean? Like, and,

1646
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:07,830
and unless the guy is like,
you know, doing my shtick,
which know that he's doing,

1647
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:11,660
I'm not going to get mad at somebody.
You know what I mean? Like it just,

1648
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:13,590
I don't have the time.
I agree with you.

1649
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:17,290
A hunting or sound or the energy and
some people did. Some of our friends,

1650
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:21,960
people we all know, you know, like
that's how they spend most of their time.

1651
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,590
Bad mouthing other comics.

1652
01:31:23,591 --> 01:31:26,250
How about your boy Dave Cross and then
fucking huge thing he did about Larry,

1653
01:31:26,251 --> 01:31:29,400
the cable guy that it
took hours to write man,

1654
01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:33,840
why are you even that guy? Like
fuck your girlfriend, you know,

1655
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:36,480
live your life,
go downtown and get drunk.

1656
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:41,250
For some people there's an underlying
feeling of they haven't achieved enough

1657
01:31:41,251 --> 01:31:44,400
success and when anybody else
has success somehow or another,

1658
01:31:44,401 --> 01:31:46,140
it draws away from their success.

1659
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:51,270
And if they feel that this a person
who has success is cable guy from David

1660
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:53,840
Cross, he who knows it just,
it's in the public eye.

1661
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:57,690
We didn't almost get arrested development
and you know, you know what I mean?

1662
01:31:57,691 --> 01:31:59,950
Like fighting same parts.

1663
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:03,760
But it's not saying that then
you're looking at rationally. Right.

1664
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:06,820
I think we all come from
this really fucked up place.

1665
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:11,200
Every comic comes from some
weird deficits, you know,

1666
01:32:11,201 --> 01:32:14,440
and a guy like Dave is not immune
to it and we are an Mri nor are you.

1667
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:18,410
And there's definitely been guys, I've
been mad at petty shit, but you know,

1668
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:23,590
it's because it got personal and it's not
because of, you know, cause they suck.

1669
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:28,300
And I think Dave's point was that he said
that Larry was racist and w the stuff

1670
01:32:28,301 --> 01:32:32,280
he was doing was like, it was
like, but racist people love him.

1671
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:36,940
I think you could say that
about it. Right. It's horrible,

1672
01:32:36,941 --> 01:32:38,800
horrible fans.
Some of them,

1673
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:43,210
you know that guy fills out stadiums
like football still, Huh? Yeah. Yeah.

1674
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:47,500
Joshua Wolf opened for him in a
football arena, I dunno. Fifth Office.

1675
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:50,830
He's a comic. He does the Chelsea
handler show all the time.

1676
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:54,400
He opened for him for 50,000 people.

1677
01:32:55,500 --> 01:33:00,170
Even seeing the 55 dice says according to,
uh,

1678
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,870
Ari Shaffir talk to dice about it.

1679
01:33:01,871 --> 01:33:05,920
And then what you do is you just play
pretending that your buddies are in the

1680
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:08,560
back of the room and
tried to make them laugh.

1681
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:10,660
That's kind of what Steve Martin said.
You know?

1682
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:13,840
Did you ever read the Steve Martin Book
about why he quit standup or it's about

1683
01:33:13,841 --> 01:33:17,410
him born standing up. I have it. He gave
it to me for Christmas two years ago.

1684
01:33:17,411 --> 01:33:21,300
I never cracked it out. And
you're on a plane for six
hours. Yeah. Yeah. Seriously.

1685
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:25,450
I do my best. I'll do my best
writing and I do podcasts on planes.

1686
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:30,360
I can't read it. I read the thing and I
think in one sitting and it really is.

1687
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:36,020
Yeah. It bumps you ever into him.
Huge. I love, let's get small. Yeah,

1688
01:33:36,021 --> 01:33:39,280
I mean that's what he's one of
the reasons I'm a stand up. Yeah.

1689
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:42,850
Probably the main reason. Yeah. Yeah.
He was the first guy got really,

1690
01:33:42,851 --> 01:33:47,200
really into and I would tell those jokes
to my friends and at that point I was

1691
01:33:47,201 --> 01:33:48,790
never like,
I'm going to be a stand up.

1692
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:51,580
Cause I had this one kid
in my neighborhood is a
fat kid who thought he was

1693
01:33:51,581 --> 01:33:54,970
going to be the next John Belushi and he
was like, you're not funny. I'm funny.

1694
01:33:55,150 --> 01:33:58,360
Oh God. He was one of those
guys. Those guys are fucked.

1695
01:33:58,370 --> 01:34:02,100
Kind of a bully about being funny. It's
ridiculous. And the guy who runs around,

1696
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:04,750
you're missing the whole fucking point of
it. Right? Almost everybody that I know.

1697
01:34:04,751 --> 01:34:05,740
That's really funny.

1698
01:34:05,741 --> 01:34:08,620
It didn't think they were funny and you
got to talk them into being funny. Yeah.

1699
01:34:08,621 --> 01:34:11,270
Well that's what happened to
me. It was a friend, uh, uh,

1700
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:14,560
was working at a Mcdonald's in
Sacramento and this, you know,

1701
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:18,310
I'm 19 working at a shitty
Mcdonald's and was, but he's like,

1702
01:34:18,311 --> 01:34:21,850
you should try stand up. And I was
like, no. He's like, yeah, you should,

1703
01:34:21,851 --> 01:34:25,340
you write jokes every day, you know? And
I was writing jokes every day. Why was,

1704
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,350
I was making jokes up,
you know,

1705
01:34:27,351 --> 01:34:31,100
and making like structuring them and
doing basically what we do with that

1706
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,470
without knowing that that's
what I was doing. Holy Shit.

1707
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:35,320
Just bits about the people.

1708
01:34:35,321 --> 01:34:38,340
I would write little cartoons and put
them up in the wall and shit. And uh,

1709
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:41,880
you know, but it was basically I
was writing jokes. Wow. That's,

1710
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:43,030
you did that to me too.

1711
01:34:43,031 --> 01:34:46,820
And Steve Martin was the reason I got
into when I was in high school, uh,

1712
01:34:46,830 --> 01:34:49,630
I was not a class clown. I was
not funny. Like a lot of people,

1713
01:34:49,631 --> 01:34:52,010
like when I was in high school, they
found out that I was a comedian there.

1714
01:34:52,011 --> 01:34:55,000
Like what the fuck you became a comedian.
But what I did do,

1715
01:34:55,001 --> 01:34:58,220
I was an artist and when I did do is
I would draw cartoons of the teachers

1716
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,710
that were hilarious.
Like there was a guy named Mr. White.

1717
01:35:00,711 --> 01:35:02,840
He was this crazy guy who
got back from Vietnam.

1718
01:35:02,841 --> 01:35:04,610
He was whacked and he was really short.

1719
01:35:04,611 --> 01:35:07,430
So I'd always draw him standing
on a stool, like everything.

1720
01:35:07,431 --> 01:35:08,181
No matter what it was,

1721
01:35:08,181 --> 01:35:12,260
he was standing on a stool and it was
always like him going fucking crazy about

1722
01:35:12,261 --> 01:35:14,480
nom and hookers and you know,

1723
01:35:14,481 --> 01:35:17,510
and so I would do different
cartoons about different teachers.

1724
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:21,680
Like that was the only part of my humor
that that showed itself at all in high

1725
01:35:21,681 --> 01:35:22,010
school.

1726
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:24,630
Imagine you had a cell phone back
then you can record this shit. Right.

1727
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:28,340
I had the same guy, he was like a
Vietnam vet and he was just crazy.

1728
01:35:28,341 --> 01:35:30,590
And he would say all these terminology
and you're like, what's that mean?

1729
01:35:30,591 --> 01:35:33,980
Like you'd be like, don't you get your h
e double x are put you in the kitty bag.

1730
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:35,480
And everyone's like,
what's a kitty bag?

1731
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:38,070
And I guess that's some kind
of bag soldiers you, yeah.

1732
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:42,600
Oh, so he would talk and like IED talk
and so weird and got acronyms are,

1733
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:45,290
that was how I kind of turned it
around in high school. You know,

1734
01:35:45,291 --> 01:35:50,190
I was a giant nerd, but by senior year I
was doing radio and I was also doing a,

1735
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:53,970
the school paper and I was writing jokes
and that kind of thing. Really? Yeah.

1736
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,990
Being funny in these music reviews.

1737
01:35:56,350 --> 01:36:00,700
And there was a teacher who had lost his
shit and he was a nom guy and he killed

1738
01:36:00,701 --> 01:36:03,940
a dog. He had, his neighbor's
dog was staying at his house.

1739
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:08,050
And the dog started barking and,
or like incessantly barking.

1740
01:36:08,051 --> 01:36:10,090
So he killed the dog.
And uh,

1741
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:14,740
I thought it was funny to bark at that
teachers face and that got around school

1742
01:36:14,741 --> 01:36:18,750
that I just did this crazy barking
thing and made the guy kind of have a

1743
01:36:18,751 --> 01:36:22,690
meltdown and like turned
everything around for me.

1744
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:26,350
It was one of those things of everybody
going, hey posting's not a retard.

1745
01:36:26,350 --> 01:36:28,750
He's kind of funny.
That's fucking crazy.

1746
01:36:28,751 --> 01:36:32,440
So you got in this Vietnam veteran
dog kill or space and barked.

1747
01:36:33,730 --> 01:36:37,820
What was his reaction to you? Barking? He
peed himself. He wanted to hit me. Whoa.

1748
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:41,760
They turned really red faced and
just had a total meltdown. And uh,

1749
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:42,820
did you feel in danger?

1750
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:47,230
I know cause I had other kids laughing
and I was so like that was so much more

1751
01:36:47,231 --> 01:36:51,400
important, you know. So
when you left high school,

1752
01:36:51,401 --> 01:36:54,130
you had a direct path, you knew you
were going to be currently no, no,

1753
01:36:54,131 --> 01:36:57,010
I was going to junior college
and that's why I was living up.

1754
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:59,140
I got kicked out of the house cause I,

1755
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,770
I barely made it out
of high school cause I,

1756
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:04,630
my grades had been really strong in
the beginning when I was a total nerd.

1757
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:06,970
And then when I tried to turn it around,
they got,

1758
01:37:06,971 --> 01:37:09,450
it started going south because I
just wanted to be the class clown.

1759
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:10,450
I tried to make people laugh,

1760
01:37:10,451 --> 01:37:13,510
I got kicked out of classes and while
they didn't even know you were actually

1761
01:37:13,511 --> 01:37:16,740
working towards a future yeah,
when I was, yeah. And then, uh,

1762
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:19,810
just didn't know studying and you were,

1763
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:22,480
you were being literally studying.
Yeah.

1764
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:25,150
And so whether it's an
understudy Wani I actually,

1765
01:37:25,151 --> 01:37:29,710
I called a bunch of comedy clubs in
Sacramento and couldn't get into like the

1766
01:37:29,711 --> 01:37:32,200
lab and limits, you know,
remember those places.

1767
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:36,520
And I think there's two clubs still
up there now. There's the punchline.

1768
01:37:36,521 --> 01:37:39,460
But I tried getting in and couldn't
get in and they said, well,

1769
01:37:39,461 --> 01:37:43,750
when you turn 21 and so the week I turned
21 and went in with 10 minutes already

1770
01:37:43,751 --> 01:37:46,850
written. And uh, uh, just that was it.

1771
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:52,020
So similar to my story starting out
younger? No, I was 21 too. Oh, you were?

1772
01:37:52,050 --> 01:37:56,310
Yeah. So similar to the same story
of uh, telling other people's jokes.

1773
01:37:56,311 --> 01:37:59,080
Like for me it was Kennison
and Richard Pryor. I would,

1774
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,490
I was delivering newspapers and I would
go to the office and tell people like

1775
01:38:02,491 --> 01:38:07,080
these Kennison bits that I saw online
and I was still, you know, in my head,

1776
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:11,220
I could never do it myself.
I just, you know, it was in
my head I was like, this is,

1777
01:38:11,221 --> 01:38:15,680
this is like fantasy funded. It
was grammar school for me. Really?

1778
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:19,770
Yeah. With the Steve Martin
and I must've admin. But 77,

1779
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:24,090
six one was he popular? Yeah, I didn't,
I had a totally different career path.

1780
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:28,470
I didn't think until, I didn't even
think about stand up, think about it.

1781
01:38:28,471 --> 01:38:32,250
I just thought I loved being funny.
I never thought, like I said,

1782
01:38:32,251 --> 01:38:36,010
I never thought I could do it. You were
just inspired by it to love this love.

1783
01:38:36,930 --> 01:38:39,660
I love making kids laugh.
And uh, I remember, uh,

1784
01:38:39,690 --> 01:38:42,120
as Kate at my school had
never seen the bad news bears.

1785
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:46,890
And a in one day I told him the whole plot
or the bad news bears like started it,

1786
01:38:46,891 --> 01:38:50,340
the break and then we'll be getting, you
know, between second period and you know,

1787
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:53,220
like a 10 o'clock in the morning. I
started telling him and then, you know,

1788
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:57,030
we get called the class and then at lunch
I met up with them again and I'm like,

1789
01:38:57,031 --> 01:39:00,750
okay, so then this happens and just
told them the whole, all the jokes,

1790
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:02,040
all the funny parts of the,

1791
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:04,780
do you imagine if that kid didn't want
to hear it at all and he was just being

1792
01:39:04,781 --> 01:39:08,980
tortured by you all day?
It's like eventually this
mother fucker last shut up.

1793
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:12,550
Laugh. Cause I knew like how to
tell those jokes. I knew how I say,

1794
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:14,590
you know what I mean?
Like how to set them up and

1795
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:16,920
it's, we're, spoiler alert came, was born

1796
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:21,600
one of my parents when I was 13 my
parents took me to see live on the sunset

1797
01:39:21,601 --> 01:39:25,290
strip and a wow, that's cool. It was a
crowded, yeah. My parents are hippies.

1798
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:27,660
They're pretty open minded and uh,

1799
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:30,570
it was a crowded theater and
I remember laughing so hard.

1800
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,280
I remember there was one point where I
stopped in the middle of it cause I was

1801
01:39:33,281 --> 01:39:36,270
just so bewildered and I looked around
the theater, I looked behind me,

1802
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,770
I looked to the left and me and people
were like moving up and down and slapping

1803
01:39:40,771 --> 01:39:44,010
their legs and everyone was moving and
laughing. They were laughing so hard.

1804
01:39:44,011 --> 01:39:47,160
I remember thinking,
this guy is just talking,

1805
01:39:47,470 --> 01:39:51,780
this is incredible that he's just up there
talking like I've never seen anything

1806
01:39:51,781 --> 01:39:52,411
like this before.

1807
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:55,740
And I thought about all the movies that
I saw that I love like stripes and all

1808
01:39:55,741 --> 01:39:59,520
these great comedy movies that was so
funny, but they were never this funny.

1809
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:02,400
I was like, this is a different kind of
funny and it's just this guy talking.

1810
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:04,170
And I remember that stuck with me,
man,

1811
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:08,130
that stuck with me for years now when I
was 13 I still never thought about doing

1812
01:40:08,131 --> 01:40:11,280
it until I was like right before I did it.
That's when I thought about doing,

1813
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:15,840
I got talked into doing it
by some friends, but he was
19 2019 and 20 years old.

1814
01:40:15,841 --> 01:40:18,810
Yeah. Yeah. Once you get going,
man, then you realize, God,

1815
01:40:18,811 --> 01:40:20,460
why would I have ever
wanted to do anything else?

1816
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,060
Have you been following this Tracy Morgan?
Shit, I was going to bring that up.

1817
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:27,780
Yeah. Yeah. Tracy Morgan went off
and said that if his son was gay,

1818
01:40:27,781 --> 01:40:32,010
he would stab that little nigger and
to death. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know,

1819
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:37,370
I can picture him saying it,
but it's kind of fun, you know?

1820
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:41,100
Yeah. If he had said that any
place else other than onstage,

1821
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:42,330
I would never give them a pass.

1822
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:46,440
But when people have to
realize is sometimes you say
shit on stage and you don't

1823
01:40:46,441 --> 01:40:48,790
know what the fuck you're
saying. You're just, yeah,

1824
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,960
you're ad libbing and you're going
down a road and then maybe you'd take a

1825
01:40:51,961 --> 01:40:53,980
choice just to be,
and then

1826
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,940
you fuck up and you say something really
stupid and you don't know where to go

1827
01:40:57,941 --> 01:40:59,500
with it and you try to be funny with it.

1828
01:40:59,501 --> 01:41:04,240
And then I don't necessarily think
that is what he believes he might,

1829
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:07,540
I might be wrong, you know, but
it's saying something on stage.

1830
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:08,620
It sounds like a cop out,

1831
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,680
but saying something on at saying
something in the real world to me are two

1832
01:41:11,681 --> 01:41:14,530
different things.
That's a performance as a character I'm,

1833
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,330
it's not really
understanding what you think.

1834
01:41:16,331 --> 01:41:19,690
He's kind of doing a character
where it's more exaggerated,

1835
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:23,530
ignorant version of himself.
I think that it's so close to reality.

1836
01:41:23,531 --> 01:41:27,460
He's done so much fucked up shit. It's
not like he's this really conservative,

1837
01:41:27,461 --> 01:41:30,100
buttoned down guy and it's
like his dice man character.

1838
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:33,010
What I love about him is he kind of
doesn't give a fuck. Like I hear,

1839
01:41:33,011 --> 01:41:38,011
I heard stories of when he was at SNL
where he's like saying to women staffers,

1840
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:39,670
you know, like, I'm going to fuck you.

1841
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:42,850
I'm going to put a baby in
that it's like getting pregnant

1842
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:45,783
pregnant.

1843
01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:50,870
Like I just feel like he has gotten away
with so much that he probably thinks

1844
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:54,820
like there are no lines in his head
and giggles to his wife. You know,

1845
01:41:54,821 --> 01:41:57,970
like I think like, you know how
we are, we're out our friends,

1846
01:41:57,971 --> 01:42:00,400
like there's shit that we'll
say around our friends.

1847
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:03,450
We would never fucking say on steam.
Right, right. You know what I,

1848
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:04,660
I call it house humor,

1849
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:08,830
what I meant like I am not racist at all,

1850
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:13,060
but I'll say the most horrible racist
or homophobic things to make my friend

1851
01:42:13,061 --> 01:42:17,500
laugh. And I like how he is in his hand
and I think that's what it was. Yeah.

1852
01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:19,810
And I think because he
has no lines on his act,

1853
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:23,800
his act has gotten dirtier and
dirtier over the years, you know?

1854
01:42:23,801 --> 01:42:25,510
And he's just good people love it.

1855
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:28,840
And he's given this excuse to kind
of push it and push it. It's chaos.

1856
01:42:28,841 --> 01:42:30,760
And that's why he's so popular.

1857
01:42:30,761 --> 01:42:34,090
And that's why people love him is because
he's also playing that character on 30

1858
01:42:34,091 --> 01:42:38,620
rock words. It's basically, yeah,
it's an exaggerated version of him.

1859
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,650
Kim, like mixed with
Martin Lawrence like crazy.

1860
01:42:41,830 --> 01:42:45,630
This was just a hateful misstep and that's
where the issue lies. And I feel bad.

1861
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:50,590
Yeah. So I mean there's some, there's
certain things that I say ridiculous shit.

1862
01:42:50,591 --> 01:42:52,840
Sometimes,
but I would never say anything like that.

1863
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:57,700
Even even in my most racist
joke when no one else is around,

1864
01:42:57,730 --> 01:43:02,730
how Schumer type situation wouldn't say
that I was on this truck stop too close

1865
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:09,230
to that as bad as or flag just to
make my wife laugh or make one of my,

1866
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:14,170
whoever's going to get you know back then
or you know, he's in a lot of trouble.

1867
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:18,250
They're going crazy. They're going
crazy after him. Yeah. It's fascinating.

1868
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:21,730
It's fascinating to watch
people get upset. Do they
want to fire out? Yeah, man.

1869
01:43:21,731 --> 01:43:26,680
It's stand up though and yeah,
it's a bad joke. It's not funny.

1870
01:43:27,130 --> 01:43:31,300
Yeah. He apologized. Look, I think,
you know he's going to have to leave.

1871
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:34,030
Evaluate second. He said it.
He probably went, Oh God.

1872
01:43:34,031 --> 01:43:36,730
You know I've definitely done that.
Where I take a joke the wrong way.

1873
01:43:36,731 --> 01:43:38,860
Like you were talking. I'm,
most of my stuff is written,

1874
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:43,420
but every once in a while I will go out
on a river, you know, just riffing and Oh,

1875
01:43:43,421 --> 01:43:47,050
I've taken some terrible rifts that
cause the rest of the night I'll like,

1876
01:43:47,051 --> 01:43:51,670
think of it what I sent them
while you're driving home and like,

1877
01:43:51,671 --> 01:43:55,640
just shit. Fuck did I say that? Because
you just, you know, you don't know.

1878
01:43:55,641 --> 01:43:59,360
Every now and then you take a chance
and something crazy will come out and

1879
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:01,130
you're like, Whoa, this is a new bit.

1880
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:04,130
And then it'll become seniors to write
it down and then you'll start doing it

1881
01:44:04,131 --> 01:44:06,860
and you'll do it on a regular basis.
I have a lot of my bits, you know,

1882
01:44:06,861 --> 01:44:10,670
that a lot of my bits are something that
I said on spur of the moment on stage

1883
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:12,440
and the next thing you know,
expand on it.

1884
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:17,000
But every now and then you go down a
dark road and it's so different from the

1885
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:19,430
Michael Richards thing.
I know people were bringing it up,

1886
01:44:19,431 --> 01:44:24,110
but Michael Richards isn't a standup
and it was, he was not good at that.

1887
01:44:24,111 --> 01:44:25,790
That's why he had that meltdown.

1888
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:29,570
He had fucking no business being at
the laugh factory on a Friday night or

1889
01:44:29,571 --> 01:44:32,450
whatever. Right. You know, in
the middle of a pack show. Yeah.

1890
01:44:32,451 --> 01:44:36,230
He was basically an open miker who was a
TV star and a lot of people didn't know

1891
01:44:36,231 --> 01:44:38,990
that. A lot of people assume that
he had a background in stand up,

1892
01:44:38,991 --> 01:44:42,890
but like do you ever seen him do standup?
He was a software guy.

1893
01:44:43,390 --> 01:44:46,940
You were there while he was at the
comedy store first and then he went right

1894
01:44:46,941 --> 01:44:47,830
over to,
uh,

1895
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:51,020
down the street to the laptop and I saw
some of these stories and ate at the

1896
01:44:51,021 --> 01:44:53,090
comedy store. And I mean, honestly,

1897
01:44:53,091 --> 01:44:56,540
I thought he was fucked up out of his
mind on something that I thought he was

1898
01:44:56,541 --> 01:44:59,600
coked up. Yeah. You and big
called Brent. Yeah. Joe,

1899
01:44:59,601 --> 01:45:02,030
that night he called me and
then Brent Ernst came back.

1900
01:45:02,031 --> 01:45:04,670
We went to the comedy store. I
missed him. My spot was on after him,

1901
01:45:04,671 --> 01:45:06,300
so I came to the comedy
store and then Brent earns,

1902
01:45:06,301 --> 01:45:08,450
came over from the comedy store and said,
dude,

1903
01:45:08,451 --> 01:45:11,690
I just saw the craziest fucking shit ever.
He goes,

1904
01:45:11,691 --> 01:45:14,900
I just saw Michael Richards have a
meltdown and yell at people and call them

1905
01:45:14,901 --> 01:45:17,960
niggers in the audience. So he was at
that, he was there and we were like,

1906
01:45:17,961 --> 01:45:18,771
get the fuck out of here.

1907
01:45:18,771 --> 01:45:20,720
But I thought that would be
the end of it because I mean,

1908
01:45:20,721 --> 01:45:22,820
we've heard a million crazy stories.

1909
01:45:22,910 --> 01:45:26,180
I mean I've seen how many times you've
seen Joey Diaz whip his dick out at the

1910
01:45:26,181 --> 01:45:29,440
comedy store already or
girls put cell phone,

1911
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:32,290
pulled her assets hallsband
back in the day and store.

1912
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:37,300
Brian holds a con the first second go
credit and having to dig himself out of

1913
01:45:38,271 --> 01:45:42,850
that hole. I started Saturday night by
the way. Still got it. That dude is, yeah,

1914
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:46,910
I saw him Saturday. Oh, flaring Connie.
He's an an uncharted treasure. Yeah.

1915
01:45:46,911 --> 01:45:48,430
Why do people have known about him?
They,

1916
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:51,620
I don't know how to get
him on the podcast. I would
love to have on the podcast,

1917
01:45:51,621 --> 01:45:53,950
you know he's like a
meter maid, is he? Yeah,

1918
01:45:54,230 --> 01:45:56,720
he's like a meter maid slash
dog catcher. Yeah. Yeah.

1919
01:45:57,080 --> 01:46:01,320
He's like a dog catcher slash meter
maid in Manhattan beach. He's,

1920
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:05,210
this is a joke I always quote. He
goes, uh, students that Susan Smith,

1921
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:08,180
she drowned her kids.
I heard those are bad kids.

1922
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:11,720
I heard this sat that close to the TV.
They didn't put the blocks away.

1923
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,830
Those kids will not be missed.

1924
01:46:13,790 --> 01:46:16,760
And we were sitting the back of the room
and this was like the day after she got

1925
01:46:16,761 --> 01:46:19,220
fucking caught drowning your kids.
The first joke,

1926
01:46:19,221 --> 01:46:20,820
I saw him dues in San Francisco.

1927
01:46:20,821 --> 01:46:25,030
Egos like woke up this morning with a
hairless Filipino boy up my ass. I, uh,

1928
01:46:25,070 --> 01:46:27,170
pulled him out. I Fed them
breakfast, set him on his way

1929
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,370
to the back of the room.
Good. Who the fuck is this guy

1930
01:46:37,010 --> 01:46:41,920
or lady him? Him and Brody
Stevens. There's this, these
characters that really go,

1931
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:45,270
aren't they characters or are they
getting say is a little insane.

1932
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:47,650
And Brian's a little insane too.
They're both of them saying,

1933
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:49,980
but that's why they're
good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1934
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,950
I don't think you get good at comedy
unless you're not at least a little crazy.

1935
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:53,660
Yeah.

1936
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:56,480
I was telling Brody, I saw Bernie
also at the same night. I was like,

1937
01:46:56,481 --> 01:46:57,980
I wanted to do a sitcom with you,

1938
01:46:57,981 --> 01:47:02,150
Brody and Holtzmann and then you guys
have a dog. But it's like three's company.

1939
01:47:02,151 --> 01:47:04,400
You're not allowed to have the
dogs when they were landlords home.

1940
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:07,700
You have to dress the dog up as a
PR person. Why isn't that on it?

1941
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:14,220
How high were you when you came
over to this totally works.

1942
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:18,250
We'll go pitch that to the network is
actually trying to get a show going for

1943
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:21,360
Brody cause he's realized
that people need to see Brody.

1944
01:47:21,390 --> 01:47:24,300
What kind of show shark tank
he's been pitching around.

1945
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:27,760
Brian tried to do a podcast with him
but apparently it was just a disaster.

1946
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,050
We talked about that at the,

1947
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:33,720
at the Improv I listened to about fun and
the last time I got high in the Improv

1948
01:47:33,721 --> 01:47:37,800
parking lot. Oh really? Probably
haven't been back there in a while.

1949
01:47:37,801 --> 01:47:39,240
So what a great club that is.

1950
01:47:39,450 --> 01:47:42,390
I never realized how great the the
Improv was cause I was always doing the

1951
01:47:42,391 --> 01:47:43,224
comedy store.

1952
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:46,290
And then when my whole thing with the
store went down and I started performing

1953
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:49,500
the Improv and like why everyone's
so nice here. Such a nicer place.

1954
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:52,910
Just such a bunch better club. Are you
around this weekend? This weekend? Yeah.

1955
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:57,090
Yeah. Yeah. It's brand per se and friends.
Oh really? Friday and Saturday. So yeah.

1956
01:47:57,091 --> 01:47:58,950
You should come by fucking sound by,
yeah,

1957
01:47:58,951 --> 01:48:00,760
this is one of my first
weekends home for awhile. Uh,

1958
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,680
definitely one of the nights I'll talk
to you. I'll call you. Yeah. Yeah.

1959
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:04,100
Well we're going out.
Um,

1960
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:07,440
another thing that I saw that I wanted
to talk about before I forget is that I

1961
01:48:07,441 --> 01:48:11,790
watch a fucking, somebody sent me
something about animals killing animals,

1962
01:48:11,791 --> 01:48:16,650
which is my Twitter feed is a
fascinating now because I keep retweeting

1963
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:19,860
fascinating things and then
tweeting fascinating things.

1964
01:48:19,861 --> 01:48:23,340
Like I'll read some science journal
about black holes or my large Hadron

1965
01:48:23,341 --> 01:48:24,240
collider type shit.

1966
01:48:24,570 --> 01:48:29,570
And so every day people start tweeting
me these weird fucking links and this guy

1967
01:48:30,091 --> 01:48:32,310
tweeted me some shit about animals.

1968
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:34,800
They get fucked up by
like little cute animals,

1969
01:48:34,801 --> 01:48:37,380
like animals that you wouldn't
think would be bad asses.

1970
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:41,850
And one of them is the fucking bull frog.

1971
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:46,680
Tude bull frog. Yeah. Yeah. Really?

1972
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:50,730
Oh my God. You got to watch this
video, man. I wanna. I want to fire up.

1973
01:48:50,731 --> 01:48:53,460
Fire up this video, Brian.
It's called bull frogs.

1974
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:57,780
Eat everything you got. You got to see
this because it's going to fucking,

1975
01:48:57,830 --> 01:49:01,890
they eat scorpions.
They eat the poisonous snakes.

1976
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:06,090
They mice,
they fly through the air and catch birds.

1977
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:09,660
They can jump like a motherfucker
had no idea. I had no idea either.

1978
01:49:09,661 --> 01:49:13,620
They have the crazy tongues. They have
the Thomas, they have this giant mouth.

1979
01:49:13,621 --> 01:49:15,330
It's bigger than their whole head.
Right out of their mouth.

1980
01:49:15,331 --> 01:49:20,280
Opens up a dumpster fucking kill bird to,
there's a fucking video of it,

1981
01:49:20,281 --> 01:49:22,200
man. I want you to watch
this cause it's so trippy.

1982
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:25,150
We'll end with this and I just
want to get to your point.

1983
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:30,180
What was that dirty or commercials?
Commercials on these fucking videos.

1984
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:35,700
So, um, yeah, this bird, the
terrain. Angela's Scorpions.

1985
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:39,510
I don't know why they don't die
from these things, but they fucking,

1986
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:44,250
they also eat bull frogs.
Date smaller bowls. The frogs.
Yes. Check this shit out.

1987
01:49:44,251 --> 01:49:47,980
You're going to freak out.
Turn it up. Frogs are just a

1988
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,950
selective eaters.
Feasting only on flies

1989
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:58,570
and that's what I always thought it was.
Just flies. Yeah. Rock. For example,

1990
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:02,733
spiders,

1991
01:50:08,550 --> 01:50:12,310
snakes,
fish,

1992
01:50:12,630 --> 01:50:16,750
and just about him. Should I fucking
mouse a mouse in his mouth? That's insane.

1993
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,660
But how do they manage to
be such eating machines?

1994
01:50:24,230 --> 01:50:27,740
Dave, the Smith Center of using
cross don't have big claws,

1995
01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:30,190
sharp beaks or fangs,

1996
01:50:32,370 --> 01:50:34,730
giant houses that what have you overcome?

1997
01:50:34,731 --> 01:50:37,430
Pinchers poisons and spicy stingers.

1998
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:45,610
Great outdoors.

1999
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:50,150
How fucking crazy that he's just jack
the score piano look up. Biggest Mount,

2000
01:50:50,151 --> 01:50:54,850
but God, is he using his hands
to put yes. Yes. Yes. Watch him.

2001
01:50:54,851 --> 01:50:55,684
Jack does transfer.

2002
01:50:56,170 --> 01:51:01,170
They've been known to swim 20 feet
to shore and additional 20 feet.

2003
01:51:03,290 --> 01:51:07,640
Rapamycin or were they always like this
or these Newton bullfrog oh shit we're

2004
01:51:07,641 --> 01:51:10,730
putting in. It's Rocketdyne. Yeah. Oh God.

2005
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:14,930
That had been known to stop and
it's like a lion on the proud.

2006
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:15,883
Oh my God.

2007
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:26,230
When?
How fucking crazy is that?

2008
01:51:26,231 --> 01:51:29,270
I love for using their hands
like that. Yeah. Really Weird.

2009
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:33,070
Don't even eat each other.
Why not?

2010
01:51:33,630 --> 01:51:36,800
Small Bull Frog?
That doesn't watch it step easily.

2011
01:51:36,830 --> 01:51:41,540
Look how big this bull frog eating.
Yes, they are quite cannibalistic

2012
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:47,250
young. Both heart muscle
quickly learn one simple, oh no,

2013
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:51,450
eat whatever we had once.
Oh Jesus.

2014
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:55,000
That's like you eating a
10 year old in one bite.

2015
01:51:55,780 --> 01:52:00,320
I mean you see how fucking big den is.
How crazy is that in and out?

2016
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:01,173
It's closed.

2017
01:52:02,650 --> 01:52:06,880
Are you stat? I used to be in frog jumping
contest as a kid. I was first place.

2018
01:52:06,881 --> 01:52:09,790
It was the first time I ever was on TV.
What does that even mean? We used to have,

2019
01:52:09,791 --> 01:52:12,230
yeah, jumping frogs from Ohio.
There's not much in Ohio.

2020
01:52:12,231 --> 01:52:17,231
I said we get have fraud contest where
you raced frogs against each other and I

2021
01:52:17,261 --> 01:52:21,040
won like first place one year and stuff
like that. But I used to have buckets.

2022
01:52:21,041 --> 01:52:21,880
You're on frog.
Yeah.

2023
01:52:21,881 --> 01:52:25,510
I used to have tons of frogs and I would
like train them and and do all this

2024
01:52:25,511 --> 01:52:28,660
crazy shit but those
motherfuckers are crazy. We had,

2025
01:52:28,690 --> 01:52:33,550
I had this one frog that would have these
crazy suction cup things on his hands

2026
01:52:33,551 --> 01:52:36,580
and he could just jump onto like
a window and then like it was,

2027
01:52:36,581 --> 01:52:37,570
I think it was a toad maybe,

2028
01:52:37,571 --> 01:52:41,650
but it would jump all over it and it just
climbed it all over the house. It was,

2029
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:44,560
frogs are amazing. I love, I'm
a big fan of frogs and one sec.

2030
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:48,980
That's going to be a
quote online somewhere

2031
01:52:52,870 --> 01:52:57,560
now. That's fucking crazy. I've never
seen that. There is so bizarre. It's just,

2032
01:52:58,230 --> 01:53:01,190
if they were big, like I say about
everything, if there are big,

2033
01:53:01,191 --> 01:53:03,890
we'd be freaking out. You know? If
there were a size of horses, you know,

2034
01:53:03,891 --> 01:53:05,600
could you imagine how
terrifying the world would be?

2035
01:53:05,601 --> 01:53:09,440
A frogs were as big as horses. You know,
they're, they're creepy at monsters.

2036
01:53:09,441 --> 01:53:10,610
They're just little.
So we're lucky.

2037
01:53:10,611 --> 01:53:13,490
I think we're some genetic
mutation away from that.

2038
01:53:13,491 --> 01:53:16,880
Just like one step away from
having prophecy type animals.

2039
01:53:16,881 --> 01:53:20,660
Do you ever see that movie the prophecy?
I remember that bear pig,

2040
01:53:20,661 --> 01:53:23,710
whatever at the end, whatever the fuck it
was. Well, why not, man? I mean, they're,

2041
01:53:23,711 --> 01:53:26,990
they're, they're so close
to doing all sorts of crazy
genetic engineering. I mean,

2042
01:53:26,991 --> 01:53:30,770
they've developed cows that develop a,
that make human breast milk.

2043
01:53:30,770 --> 01:53:35,600
Now they're genetically engineered the
identical breast milk, human breast milk,

2044
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:39,470
super injudicious friends, fringe,
fringe. Now I heard it's good. Yeah,

2045
01:53:39,471 --> 01:53:43,070
you might like it because it's about that.
It's about us being like close to,

2046
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:45,880
you know, like this other world,
you know. Well, we were, uh,

2047
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:49,220
Brian and I were talking about this
before the show started, the, uh,

2048
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:51,470
the movie transcendent man.
Have you seen that yet? No.

2049
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:55,610
It's Ray Kurzweil who is a
guy who's a new, another name.

2050
01:53:55,820 --> 01:54:00,500
He's a futurist and he's a proponent
of technological singularity.

2051
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:03,990
And you've been talking about him online,
right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, it's,

2052
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,380
he's very popular.
He's got a bunch of books called,

2053
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:09,770
one of them is the singularity is near,
which is a fucking fascinating one.

2054
01:54:09,771 --> 01:54:13,840
And his, his big thing is all about
artificial intelligence. And, uh,

2055
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:17,870
but his documentary, he thinks the robots
are gonna take over or are they all do,

2056
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:21,170
it's not just, yeah, it's not
one person that thinks to us.

2057
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:25,130
It's pretty much every single person that
is involved in artificial intelligence,

2058
01:54:25,131 --> 01:54:27,980
whether they call them our deluxe
one guy calls it artilects artificial

2059
01:54:27,981 --> 01:54:30,890
intellects. What was the company
called? The terminator. Skynet.

2060
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,080
Isn't there actually a real company now
called square? It's called Google. Yeah,

2061
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:39,710
we know. But you don't
remember like an eye robot now.

2062
01:54:39,711 --> 01:54:41,630
There actually is a
company called I robot.

2063
01:54:41,631 --> 01:54:45,170
Like that just seems like you're fucking
tempting fate when you like take some

2064
01:54:45,171 --> 01:54:48,530
horrible thing from Psi Phi and
then make it real. It's like,

2065
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:49,460
what are you thinking?

2066
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:52,880
It's like actually opening a Jurassic
Park and calling it Jurassic Park.

2067
01:54:52,890 --> 01:54:56,630
What Brian went bad is gonna happen.
We'll read the book.

2068
01:54:56,750 --> 01:55:00,380
You know what Brian and I were talking
about before the show was that this is

2069
01:55:00,381 --> 01:55:03,740
all happening while we're just
sitting here relaxing as if there's no

2070
01:55:03,741 --> 01:55:07,340
consequences whatsoever. Like
there's no meetings going on. When,

2071
01:55:07,341 --> 01:55:09,170
when the first artificial intelligence,

2072
01:55:09,171 --> 01:55:13,970
which is conceivably one of the biggest
things to ever happen to humans,

2073
01:55:14,090 --> 01:55:16,670
the first sentience,
artificial intelligent life,

2074
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:20,960
it will be switched on without any calls
to the heads of nations without any

2075
01:55:20,961 --> 01:55:24,200
vote from the people that, I mean
it's one of the biggest consequences.

2076
01:55:24,201 --> 01:55:27,350
Maybe the human race will ever face the
idea that something is going to be not

2077
01:55:27,351 --> 01:55:28,760
just more intelligent than us,

2078
01:55:28,970 --> 01:55:33,410
but literally within days it will be
millions of times more intelligence and

2079
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:38,150
asking, cause it will be
artificial intelligence and
artificial intelligence and

2080
01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:40,610
sentience.
So it will be conscious,

2081
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:44,340
it will be aware and it will be
physically capable of creating

2082
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,840
better artificial intelligence.

2083
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:50,700
So right away it will fix all the problems
that it has in its operating system.

2084
01:55:50,730 --> 01:55:54,450
All the problems it has. And you know,
whenever problems it has with processors,

2085
01:55:54,570 --> 01:55:58,800
I mean we, we will literally
within a year we'll be obsolete,

2086
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:01,320
will be just like little
monkeys that are at the zoo.

2087
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:04,320
I welcome the robot leaders and I'm just
going to be really nice to them from

2088
01:56:04,321 --> 01:56:05,154
that

2089
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:11,390
during the robots house. I
don't care. You're dead there.

2090
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:13,820
You're the first guy that are
coming to your house first there.

2091
01:56:13,850 --> 01:56:18,030
They're familiar blow jobs. They
want, they want that. Trust me.

2092
01:56:18,031 --> 01:56:18,864
We're going to be like,

2093
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:21,640
how are we going to help them see
level comedian to suck their dick?

2094
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:26,490
Is that possible? Yes. That can
save you suck the robot cats.

2095
01:56:26,491 --> 01:56:31,110
We can be cats for the robots. Be as
bad as the regular Dick. Yeah. Shiny,

2096
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:35,370
rusty, cold metal. You
can clean it really well.

2097
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:40,020
You know for sure it's clean.
Take off the plastic first. Lysol,

2098
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:43,770
spray it down. You know what you're
getting into. It's inevitable though.

2099
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:46,740
Don't make him wear a condom.
Prostitutes.

2100
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:51,300
I've heard prostitutes make you wear a
condom. I think when you get a blowjob,

2101
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:56,250
something I just read. Let's
read here. If it does happen,

2102
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:59,430
it's going to change the whole world
and it's probably going to happen and

2103
01:56:59,431 --> 01:57:01,290
everyone's just sitting back
like it's never going to happen.

2104
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:02,153
I think it's gonna be great.

2105
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:05,120
I think everyone's just looking
at the negative part of it. Okay.

2106
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:07,990
What's the positive? The positive
is that robots are going to come.

2107
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:12,780
Our friends or lovers, they're
going to make better lovers. Fuck,

2108
01:57:12,781 --> 01:57:16,210
are you doing fine? Trust me,
we're, we're fucking her lover.

2109
01:57:16,490 --> 01:57:18,770
The fleshlight had had
physician soft close.

2110
01:57:18,771 --> 01:57:22,120
This is the song you're
going to concoct robot song

2111
01:57:23,650 --> 01:57:24,090
could take our,

2112
01:57:24,090 --> 01:57:27,660
don't feel like we're super close to it
going south and like we're going to see

2113
01:57:27,661 --> 01:57:29,020
it. Yeah, we're going to see him

2114
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:31,830
miss [inaudible] the whole civilization,
you know

2115
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:35,070
down shit. Her Shit is happy.
It we could see we were,

2116
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,790
we were definitely at the
apex of where there's,

2117
01:57:37,910 --> 01:57:41,390
there's some sort of an event that's
building up to take place and I don't know

2118
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:44,990
how much longer we can continue to
progress until that event comes. Like,

2119
01:57:44,991 --> 01:57:48,440
what do you feel about when that rapture
guy a couple months ago or was it last

2120
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:49,730
month?
I just had a stroke.

2121
01:57:49,790 --> 01:57:53,960
Did he just had a stroke yesterday
kind of or a couple of days ago.

2122
01:57:53,961 --> 01:57:56,780
It was just kind of funny.
Was there a part of you going

2123
01:57:58,850 --> 01:58:03,680
right, right. You know, like
I've been going crazy. You know,

2124
01:58:03,681 --> 01:58:07,550
like all the shit that happened on an
years where a fish falling from the sky

2125
01:58:07,551 --> 01:58:10,970
and all these dead things all around
the country and then the big quakes and

2126
01:58:10,971 --> 01:58:15,200
then the fucking Japan and you know, and
New Zealand crazy tornadoes, tornadoes,

2127
01:58:15,460 --> 01:58:20,030
like they have a good marketer. You know,
like when I was in high school, you know,

2128
01:58:20,031 --> 01:58:22,990
I grew up on metal and, and uh, I
was a Christian kid too. And uh,

2129
01:58:22,991 --> 01:58:25,400
and so I was raised, uh, you know, uh,

2130
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:28,610
being aware of the Armageddon and
the rapture and all that stuff.

2131
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:33,140
And I never felt like we were close.
Like that always felt like far away but,

2132
01:58:33,170 --> 01:58:37,900
but things now, you know, where,
you know, basically, you know, they,

2133
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:42,100
they picture like the Sodom and Gomorrah,
like go to Vegas, you know, like

2134
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:45,640
it's fucking about, you know, there is,

2135
01:58:46,030 --> 01:58:49,000
if there is a vengeful God, he's looking
at a Vegas, you know what I mean?

2136
01:58:49,001 --> 01:58:52,870
Like I know it sounds crazy,
but I know we're fucking close to that.

2137
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:54,790
I don't think Vegas is the issue of Vegas.

2138
01:58:56,490 --> 01:59:01,390
Human depravity exists now. That didn't
exist in 1984 when I read those things,

2139
01:59:01,391 --> 01:59:05,650
you know, where things weren't
that bad. And when you're,

2140
01:59:05,651 --> 01:59:07,150
when you're talking
about Sodom and Gomorrah,

2141
01:59:07,151 --> 01:59:09,940
you need to go biblical scripture
and all that stuff that said,

2142
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:13,000
that's nothing compared to what's going
on in Afghanistan or I write or the

2143
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:16,540
millions of innocent people that died
because of the bombings and all the other

2144
01:59:16,541 --> 01:59:19,960
bullshit that's happened that,
but there were tiny but, but you,

2145
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:23,680
you kind of see when a crazy Christian
pulls that kind of stuff, you're like,

2146
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:27,100
sure, I sort of get where
he's coming. Well there's you,

2147
01:59:27,110 --> 01:59:30,420
there's clearly an argument that can be
made that things are accelerating. Yeah.

2148
01:59:30,421 --> 01:59:33,910
No, I mean tornadoes, we've never had this
many tornadoes before and would never,

2149
01:59:34,030 --> 01:59:37,300
I don't remember ever seen a tornado
that destroyed three quarters of a town

2150
01:59:37,301 --> 01:59:41,290
before the Joplin Missouri town.
Yeah. I mean in Tuscaloosa, Alabama,

2151
01:59:41,291 --> 01:59:44,100
I believe it was too fucking
like in a matter of seconds.

2152
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:47,770
And you're talking about things that
are like a mile wide and wider and they

2153
01:59:47,771 --> 01:59:50,170
just destroying everything in their path.
I mean if there's,

2154
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:53,080
I don't remember that before and then
the numbers are higher than ever,

2155
01:59:53,081 --> 01:59:53,811
but you know what,

2156
01:59:53,811 --> 01:59:57,550
we're dealing with such a limited amount
of years that we have a database on as

2157
01:59:57,551 --> 02:00:00,880
far as like my courtroom recording,
uh, weather and you know,

2158
02:00:00,881 --> 02:00:03,200
we know that things change
radically. We know that, you know,

2159
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:06,100
the ice ages come and go and we know that,
you know,

2160
02:00:06,101 --> 02:00:09,340
a bunch of Shit's happened that over the,
over the course of a,

2161
02:00:09,341 --> 02:00:12,910
there's been like six major extinction
events that have happened over the course

2162
02:00:12,911 --> 02:00:16,940
of the earth life. So I don't think
we have a full handle on right.

2163
02:00:17,290 --> 02:00:22,060
But I think unquestionably the scariest
thing to me or the most profound thing

2164
02:00:22,061 --> 02:00:26,200
to me is what humans are doing is not
just what the earth is doing because even

2165
02:00:26,201 --> 02:00:27,270
though all those things happened,

2166
02:00:27,271 --> 02:00:31,150
the earthquake in Japan and the tsunami
and the tornadoes and all that stuff

2167
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:34,360
right here where you and I are, nothing's
happened. You know what I'm saying?

2168
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:38,140
But we're technology is developing,
developing and growing.

2169
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,780
That's still going on while all
these events are taking place.

2170
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:44,140
The large Hadron collider is still going
off. Why all this shit is going down.

2171
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:46,870
All the different experiments that are
happening in robotics and artificial

2172
02:00:46,871 --> 02:00:49,570
intelligence and nano technology
and genetic engineering,

2173
02:00:49,571 --> 02:00:53,080
those are all still constantly taking
place and constantly moving further and

2174
02:00:53,081 --> 02:00:55,510
further and they're going to go somewhere.
They're never going to end.

2175
02:00:55,510 --> 02:00:58,060
It's never going to stop. They have,
they didn't stop with the atomic bomb.

2176
02:00:58,061 --> 02:01:00,250
They didn't stop with
mapping out the human genome.

2177
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:01,710
They're not stopping with anything.
Yeah,

2178
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:05,200
so it's kind of like up in the air
like are we going to have a biblical

2179
02:01:05,201 --> 02:01:09,890
apocalypse or assign a Saifai apocalypse?
I'm leaning towards Scifi,

2180
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:13,000
but then you look at something like the
salt and sea thing that I was talking

2181
02:01:13,001 --> 02:01:15,010
about. I mean fuck man, the apocalypse,

2182
02:01:15,011 --> 02:01:17,980
hit salt and see if that was
the only world that we lived in.

2183
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:21,370
If that was our only water and this
was the only tribe of people of Earth,

2184
02:01:21,371 --> 02:01:24,340
was there a little small place. It was
only like a few hundred miles in diameter.

2185
02:01:24,730 --> 02:01:28,210
Fuck man. That would be the apocalypse.
They're going, we would be dead.

2186
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:32,320
There'd be no water. It would
be all poisoned. I mean,
that's the end in that spot,

2187
02:01:32,321 --> 02:01:35,800
the apocalypse hit. And that's, I
think what the apocalypse really is.

2188
02:01:35,950 --> 02:01:38,740
When people wrote the Bible,
theoretically,

2189
02:01:38,741 --> 02:01:40,790
at least they didn't
have mass communication,

2190
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:42,670
they didn't have the
ability to send emails.

2191
02:01:42,930 --> 02:01:47,690
So the apocalypse was what experience,
what they experienced in their area.

2192
02:01:47,691 --> 02:01:51,170
Yeah. So Atlantis, that was the
apocalypse for them. You know,

2193
02:01:51,171 --> 02:01:54,590
anything that that took place that was,
that was real, that was the for them.

2194
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:56,870
But meanwhile, on the other side
of the world in New Zealand,

2195
02:01:57,020 --> 02:01:59,900
people were eating coconuts and partying
and getting their dick sucked and there

2196
02:01:59,901 --> 02:02:02,120
was nothing, there was nothing.
There's no, nothing going wrong there.

2197
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:06,410
So I think so in that sense, the
apocalypse is here, it's happened.

2198
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:10,640
It's just not right here. Right. You know,
and it may not ever get here. It might,

2199
02:02:10,641 --> 02:02:13,880
it might rotate, it might move
around. It might be cyclical.

2200
02:02:13,881 --> 02:02:14,900
Just like everything else.

2201
02:02:14,901 --> 02:02:17,060
There might be places that are
good at places that are bad.

2202
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:19,870
Tell yourself when you have a
young kid too. That's true too.

2203
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:23,630
You start telling yourself all
kinds of weird shit with young kids.

2204
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:27,140
You feel that? Yeah, for sure. You feel
like much more protective of things.

2205
02:02:27,141 --> 02:02:29,950
Holy Shit. Worried about your own
mortality, you know? Yeah. Yeah.

2206
02:02:30,230 --> 02:02:33,760
Worried about living in a big earthquake
tidal wave that's going to get it.

2207
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,240
Hopefully were nine at comic book
shopper in like a grocery store instead.

2208
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:39,650
We have to my first,
after the first baby.

2209
02:02:39,651 --> 02:02:42,610
That's the reason why we decided to move
to Colorado or so. I wanted to let go.

2210
02:02:42,690 --> 02:02:44,660
Why don't go where there's less people,
people,

2211
02:02:44,661 --> 02:02:46,040
things are more relaxed and you know,

2212
02:02:46,041 --> 02:02:49,000
everything's like a little more chill or
just a little bit more outside so that

2213
02:02:49,001 --> 02:02:52,910
when Shit, if shit does happen that
we're not stuck in this impossible.

2214
02:02:52,930 --> 02:02:54,800
The headstart city to get out.
Yeah.

2215
02:02:54,801 --> 02:02:58,010
You want to be in the valley when you
want to get on the freeway and being stuck

2216
02:02:58,730 --> 02:02:59,563
on the other side of that.

2217
02:02:59,610 --> 02:03:01,610
Well that's also one of the
reasons why I moved out here.

2218
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:03,050
When I first moved to Hollywood,

2219
02:03:03,051 --> 02:03:07,580
I lived in North Hollywood and my car
got broken into and they stole my radio.

2220
02:03:07,581 --> 02:03:10,810
And then I lived in Encino
for a little bit and uh, um,

2221
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:12,770
my yard got broken into and then I'm,

2222
02:03:13,070 --> 02:03:15,640
and I started slowly moving
further if those ones,

2223
02:03:15,650 --> 02:03:18,800
I had frank the pitbulls and somebody
broke in the yard and the dogs are there

2224
02:03:18,801 --> 02:03:21,630
and they fucking ran out. But then
I had, I think it was my gardener,

2225
02:03:21,631 --> 02:03:23,540
I think my gardener was
setting me up. Really? Yeah,

2226
02:03:23,541 --> 02:03:25,940
he's was asking me weird questions.
One day. It was really creepy.

2227
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:30,970
I got a new dog and my gardener goes,
it was the way he asked me. He goes, uh,

2228
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:35,360
he goes, uh, is that you're gone, your
dog or your girlfriend's dog? I go,

2229
02:03:35,361 --> 02:03:38,960
what girlfriend? Man? I go, what are you
talking about? He goes, do you live alone?

2230
02:03:39,290 --> 02:03:43,040
I go, what the fuck kind of question is
that man. And so I asked him flat out,

2231
02:03:43,041 --> 02:03:47,330
I go, you're trying to find out when I'm
home, dude. I need that. No Man, no man.

2232
02:03:47,331 --> 02:03:49,910
It was like this weird answer
that he had to it, but I was like,

2233
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:51,920
the way you asked me was just so,

2234
02:03:51,921 --> 02:03:55,650
it was like like a really clumsy
guy trying to trick you like yeah,

2235
02:03:55,790 --> 02:03:59,270
it was like I could tell that he was
like prying for information and I wasn't

2236
02:03:59,271 --> 02:04:02,720
famous or anything. You know? I need to
get some bull frogs, Joe. I know. Right.

2237
02:04:02,721 --> 02:04:05,320
Giant ones to protect my property and
get them mixed up games with a bull

2238
02:04:05,321 --> 02:04:08,510
bullfrog so then I slowly moved further
and further out and I'm going to move

2239
02:04:08,511 --> 02:04:13,040
further out still. If I stay
in California, I'm going
to get a place in big bear.

2240
02:04:13,041 --> 02:04:17,960
I think. I'm just thinking
about that lately. Have you
done any at all? Yeah, man.

2241
02:04:17,961 --> 02:04:20,190
There's too many people down
there that's just like this.

2242
02:04:20,191 --> 02:04:22,910
This we were talking about with the
monster faces, the Newport beach,

2243
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:26,510
you know those areas. I
like San Diego, but dude,

2244
02:04:26,630 --> 02:04:30,590
if the shit goes down and then everybody
abandons the border there by a bunch of

2245
02:04:30,591 --> 02:04:32,950
reactors down there too. Yes, exactly.

2246
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,780
For these places we're going to get hit
if we ever get into a war with somebody.

2247
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:39,780
True. And if we get a hit by an
earthquake and those reactors go nutty,

2248
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:43,770
then the shit goes down and everybody
abandons that area. And guess what?

2249
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:47,160
That's when you're really fucked
because Mexico's right there.

2250
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:52,340
And if the door to Mexico just comes
down and there's a nuclear apocalypse all

2251
02:04:52,381 --> 02:04:54,440
in the same area.
Fuck.

2252
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:58,470
But we also have the bit of the biggest
military bases down there. Yeah, Dude.

2253
02:04:58,471 --> 02:05:01,200
Do you think they're going to stick
there when there's a nuclear meltdown?

2254
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:03,420
Listen man,
protecting our borders,

2255
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:07,410
they're going to be protecting from
the air in led frisbees and there'll be

2256
02:05:07,411 --> 02:05:11,310
dropping bombs on people running
with bags of groceries from Vons.

2257
02:05:12,690 --> 02:05:15,990
La Jolla will be green. You'll be able
to see it from space. It'll be glowing.

2258
02:05:16,070 --> 02:05:20,900
Get a Zombie apocalypse or
an alien apocalypse. The fun
kind. Yeah, I went alien.

2259
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:22,033
Yeah.

2260
02:05:22,070 --> 02:05:26,840
I have a feeling that we all unite
together like all our enemies.

2261
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:31,070
It feels to me that it's too easy
with my Persian neighbor, you know,

2262
02:05:31,071 --> 02:05:35,600
fighting off floating a psalmist like
will Smith movie. Yeah, yeah, sure.

2263
02:05:35,930 --> 02:05:38,300
I think that, uh, the,
the idea of alien life,

2264
02:05:38,301 --> 02:05:40,010
like some sort of a physical alien life,

2265
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:44,120
it's so hokey and so that to me it just
seems like that's not going to be the

2266
02:05:44,121 --> 02:05:45,860
way it happens. I mean, I might be wrong,

2267
02:05:45,950 --> 02:05:49,520
but I think that the idea of some
physical thing that comes here and starts

2268
02:05:49,521 --> 02:05:52,370
walking amongst us and shoot and ray guns,
I'm like,

2269
02:05:52,371 --> 02:05:55,130
that's like some 1950s
a super eight is right.

2270
02:05:55,210 --> 02:05:58,200
Yeah. Kind of. I don't want to
give it away, but yeah. Robots,

2271
02:05:58,210 --> 02:06:00,870
I think I can see that.
I can see c three Po,

2272
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:04,870
some shit like that from another land
that's going to be the last guy on the

2273
02:06:05,290 --> 02:06:08,500
planet. Well that's why Battlestar
Galactica was so fucking bad ass.

2274
02:06:08,630 --> 02:06:11,030
That was it. Did you ever get
into that? The series a remake,

2275
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:16,130
the fucking bad ass people don't know
if you've never seen him go get the DVD.

2276
02:06:17,451 --> 02:06:19,640
I'm telling you, seize
joy, the shit out of it.

2277
02:06:19,660 --> 02:06:23,420
It'll then a couple of a mini series
where there was one little mini season.

2278
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:27,650
It's fucking good, man. It's so good.
Well written, cool special effects.

2279
02:06:27,830 --> 02:06:30,310
And even though it was on
the Psi Phi Network, the are,

2280
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:34,270
you can do pretty bad ass fucking special
effects in 2009 or whatever it was.

2281
02:06:34,271 --> 02:06:34,780
And they made it.

2282
02:06:34,780 --> 02:06:38,890
Tricia Helfer the Cyborg.
He could jerk it off to the hot.

2283
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:44,710
She's hot as fuck too.
Woo. Oh my God. Yeah.

2284
02:06:44,711 --> 02:06:47,950
And the cylons were bad ass.
There's different forms of cylons.

2285
02:06:47,951 --> 02:06:50,740
There was the one that looked like humans
and you could and people fell in love

2286
02:06:50,741 --> 02:06:52,180
with them or were fucking him and shit.

2287
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:55,490
And then they have a cylon
baby that someone, a man,

2288
02:06:56,770 --> 02:06:59,830
what the fuck? That's a
great one, Brian Post saying,

2289
02:06:59,831 --> 02:07:01,650
where are you going to be next coming up?
Where can people see?

The people that are asking me
questions about fear factor.

2310
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:16,240
I do not know what's happening. Um,

so they want me to do it,
so we'll see what happens.

2312
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:19,390
But I don't know if I'm gonna do it again.
