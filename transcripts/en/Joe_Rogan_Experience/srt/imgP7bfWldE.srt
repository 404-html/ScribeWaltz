1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,940
Hey fuckers were back crazy,
isn't it?

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,620
I'll answer my own question.
Yes, Joe. It is. It's crazy.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,240
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience is brought to you by, Oh,

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,480
you going with nature box? I was
going to say tank. Naturebox is fine.

5
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:22,060
Let's start with them.
It's fantastic and inevit.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,190
Naturebox is a, an option that you
can get delivered to your home,

7
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:30,180
to your office snacks that
are far healthier than
anything you're ever going to

8
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:34,260
find in a vending machine and you can get
them adjusted to whatever your dietary

9
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:38,340
requirements are. Like me,
I'm essentially gluten free.

10
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:41,160
Occasionally I've fuck off and eat
a hot dog or something like that,

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,650
but for the most part,
I don't fuck around with bread,

12
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:47,910
so I get gluten free options. They
send me things like blueberry Ahmond's,

13
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:52,740
which are great. These big island, a
Hawaiian pineapples are also fantastic.

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,840
You can get things that
are very low in sugar.

15
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:59,700
They have no artificial flavorings,
no hydrogenated,

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,220
nasty fucking weird oils and shit.

17
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:06,780
Your body doesn't like to
digest like Zero Trans Fats,

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,700
zero high fructose corn syrup,
nothing artificial, free shipping.

19
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:16,701
Also anywhere in the u s naturebox is
a great option to avoiding the nonsense

20
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,720
that you get inside vending machines.
If you're hungry and you're at work,

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,740
healthy snacks, barbecue,
kettle kernels, um,

22
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,810
everything bagel sticks,

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,770
south Pacific plantain chips and
other one of my personal favorites.

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,430
I get them delivered every week and they
usually gone within a day or two cause

25
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:40,340
I'm kind of a fucking pig. Uh, these,
there's pistachio clusters also these, uh,

26
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,890
cocoa almonds. Ah, they got
a lot of good options. Um,

27
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,370
and if you're into very specific
dietary requirements, like low sugar,

28
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:50,700
they can accommodate all that kind of
stuff. There's a lot of different options.

29
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,200
And A, I'm a big fan. It's
all very delicious too and
a lot of it is, you know,

30
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,940
completely guilt free. Um,
and if you go to naturebox,

31
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,550
go to naturebox.com forward slash,
Rogen,

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,910
that's naturebox.com forward slash Rogen.

33
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,740
You can get 50% off of your first box.
And I guarantee you, once you do it,

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,620
you're going to love it and you're
going to want to do it all the time.

35
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,180
It's a a way better alternative than most
of the stuff that you're going to get.

36
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,530
If you go searching for snacks.

37
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:22,350
Even at a grocery story you mean you're
going to have to really pick and choose

38
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,760
to find healthy snacks that have no
artificial flavors, no artificial colors,

39
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:28,020
no nuns,

40
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:32,370
and it's like trans fats and
high fructose corn syrup.

41
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:35,760
That shit is really bad for you.
If you want to find out how bad,

42
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,280
go watch a documentary called king corn.

43
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,220
Find out how it all
happened and find out what,

44
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,220
what that stuff actually
does to your body. Uh,

45
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,250
naturebox is a way to move around
all that shit and snack guilt free.

46
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:51,480
You need calories, you
need food, you need snacks.

47
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,040
Go to naturebox.com forward slash
Rogen again and get 50% off.

48
00:02:56,041 --> 00:03:01,041
Your first box of Yummy naturebox
foods were also brought to you by ting.

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,620
And what Ting is,

50
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:07,540
is a no bullshit alternative to the
cell phone coverage that most of us get.

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,560
Most of us get cell phone coverage from
the big companies and you got to deal

52
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,300
with a lot of stupid shit like contracts.

53
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,490
Ting provides you with the same service
that you would get if you were on sprint.

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,520
They use the sprint backbone and they
rent time on it and then they sell you

55
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,810
that time with the sprint rules.

56
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,780
They sell it to you with
no early termination fees,

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,700
no contracts as far as like canceling,
cancel anytime, anytime you want.

58
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,270
And they sell the best
android phones available.

59
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,270
All the coolest groovy android phones,

60
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,870
like the HTC one or the Samsung Galaxy.

61
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,370
Now it's s five,

62
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:49,170
the new ones pretty fucking slick and
the new and actually has a, um, it's,

63
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,160
it's got a fingerprint sensor,
a heart rate monitor and it's waterproof.

64
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,060
Good googly Mowgli. Where does it end? Um,

65
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,700
the waterproof is sweet though.
I'd love that option.

66
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,280
I have the galaxy note
three and I fucking love it.

67
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,760
It's giant and it's really cool
if you want to go online with it.

68
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,690
When I used to go in line with my
iPhone, um, it was kind of like just,

69
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,040
it was okay to do better than not being
able to go check out something online.

70
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,490
But I oftentimes when I'm on the road,
I don't even use my laptop.

71
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,770
I'll just use my galaxy
note three the entire time.

72
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,330
These a android phones have not just
caught up to iPhones in my opinion,

73
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,910
they've passed them and a lot
of ways features, options,

74
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,200
just not just the big screen but the note
three, the one that I use has a stylus.

75
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,730
You can write notes on it and then those
notes I use Evernote and it actually

76
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:41,731
sends those notes to my home computer
so I can look at my notes on my laptop.

77
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,780
It's pretty fucking slick.
Um,

78
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,380
Ting also has it set up so that you don't
pay for a specific amount of minutes

79
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,670
every month.
You just pay for what you use.

80
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,920
And I think that's the model that all
cell phone companies are going to use

81
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:56,110
eventually because a lot of times you're,

82
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:58,150
you're only using a certain
amount of cell phone minutes,

83
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:00,940
but you get in fucking robbed
because you're paying for much more.

84
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:03,820
And if you get over that minutes
or go over those minutes,

85
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,950
then you get hit up with a big fee.

86
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,150
You get hit up with extra charges
because you use too much service.

87
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,060
It's fucking stupid.
With Ting,

88
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,290
you use what you pay for and I personally
believe that that is going to be the

89
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,560
model that they all use in the future.

90
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,390
I think when companies
like ting come along,

91
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,660
ethical companies that do things
correctly and they're cool about it,

92
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:28,270
they do cool shit.
Like on their two year anniversary,

93
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:30,640
they slashed all their prices.
Um,

94
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,880
and especially helpful for
people who are heavy users.

95
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:36,160
People are heavy users
and heavy internet users.

96
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:39,010
They made a big impact on people's bills.
In fact,

97
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:41,890
98% of people would save money with Ting.

98
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,560
It's because they do mobile differently.

99
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,590
Go to rogan.ting.com and save 25
bucks off of your first device.

105
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,100
We have fitness DVDs like the extreme
kettlebell cardio workout DVDs by Keith

106
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,990
Weber,
which are just excellent workout DVDs.

107
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:22,991
You want a DVD that just kicks your
Dick Right into the dirt with a 35 pound

108
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:26,540
kettle bell. I know that sounds
crazy. Like Joe, you don't
know me. I'm a manly man.

109
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,750
Trust me, bitch. 35 pound
kettle bell will fuck you up.

110
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,790

it will get you to the point where
you're gonna have a goddamn heart attack.

112
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,790
We also have a really cool kettle bells,

113
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,970
the primal bells and the Zombie bells
kettle bells that were designed by an

114
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:44,900
artist to, uh, not just be
functional but also look bad ass.

115
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,490
The primal bells are the
great apes series. We have
gorillas, orangutans, chimps,

116
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:54,230
and howler monkeys that range from 18
pounds all the way up to 72 pounds.

for whatever they are,

122
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:16,160
whatever exercises you want to do,
start slowly and build a base.

123
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:19,100
Don't you start with heavyweight and
try to be a fucking meathead and hurt

124
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:23,170
yourself. Learn if you can from someone
who actually knows how to do it. Um,

125
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,250
if you have someone around

All Right, ladies and gentlemen,

155
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,810
we're about to go live
with a freaky podcast.

156
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,160
It's going to get down to some very,
very interesting subjects. Young Jamie,

157
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,270
cue the music,

158
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,630
the Joe Rogan experience,

159
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,200
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

160
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,220
Todd, uh, Dylan and Liam Reznikov.
Am I saying it correctly?

161
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,860
Liam is a guy from the underground,
from mixed martial arts.com. We've been,

162
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:54,150
uh, online friends. That's how
you say it. Online correspondence.

163
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,170
Carswell yeah. Well there's
a brotherhood, uh, on the,

164
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,760
the underground that's,
uh,

165
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,390
it's one of the most interesting mixed
martial arts websites in the world.

166
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,390
I think it's the best one as far
as access to information. And, um,

167
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,500
you think I put up the, the Helio
Gracie chronicles two, right?

168
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:15,120
I can't comment on that because at the
time I was a Btt guy and now I'm a Hoya

169
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,420
Gracie guys, we're going to have
to move these things. The, um, how,

170
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,670
how are you going to set these
up so they could see, uh,

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,260
we could see your faces better. Oh
yeah. Scoot over a little bit that way,

172
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,650
that way, that way it's not
a hope in Leeann's face. Um,

173
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,760
and um, so Liam, uh, put the,
well, you get in trouble for that.

174
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:35,190
Did you get in trouble for that?
There was a guy with a similar name to me.

175
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:39,120
He put them up, I think. Oh, okay.
Okay, cool. Whatever, whatever.

176
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,670
It totally wasn't you. Oh yeah.
Right. Absolutely. Anyway, um,

177
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,010
recently, uh, you put up, uh,
uh, an attention Joe Rogan
thread, which will they,

178
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:52,350
those things go up every now and
then on the underground. Yeah.

179
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,800
It's usually like you suck your
mother's a whore or something like that.

180
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,950
I didn't want to enable anybody by doing
that. You know, he bought a thought,

181
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,010
you know, we're coming through America
and you know, we're coming to la,

182
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:05,010
so he's got to talk right into this.
Sorry, just bring it around to you.

183
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,050
I didn't want to enable anybody,
so you know,

184
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,940
they're going to come out of
the woodworks, the Weirdos now,

185
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:10,050
but they'll come out anywhere.

186
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,820
There's no way you could stop them as
sitting at the table with you now. Yeah.

187
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,060
It's the Internet. So, um,
you, you contacted me and uh,

188
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,400
I'd seen you online, I know that you
a, you run a gym in Sydney. Yes. Yes.

189
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,460
What's the name of your gym?

190
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,460
[inaudible] Academy in Sydney and
VT one is a MMA teach more there.

191
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:29,880
You guys have pretty much
all mixed martial arts.

192
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,660
It's sort of like a white color
academy with some UFC fighters,

193
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:37,240
that sort of thing. So it's a good
place for regular folks to train. Yeah.

194
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,420
Oh we starting to scout
whole and we've kind of,

195
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,960
it just keeps moving forward and we've
ended up with a big academy by mistake.

196
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,990
Yeah,
well that's the best way to do everything.

197
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,980
But just follow what you love and it
all happens absolutely by mistake.

198
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,190
And so you put this thread up about
you and your brother Dylan being

199
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,010
in town, your brother Dylan, being a,

200
00:11:56,011 --> 00:12:00,460
a former championship kickboxer
former professional motorcycle racer.

201
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,620
And just the beginning of the,

202
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,510
the thread was so crazy because you were
a motorcycle racer who stopped doing

203
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:09,850
motorcycle racing because
he had too many concussions.

204
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,590
So what are you going to you
in a fucking Thai boxing? What?

205
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:18,340
What is and then he became a
champion. That's right. Yeah.

206
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,760
Sound like a lady boy today.
It what's going on or your voice.

207
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,390
It's a great way to reach you in the UFC.
Oh,

208
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,950
we had one of the last day this
last week and came back and he,

209
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,010
we always lose off.
That's why he's lost his voice now.

210
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:34,060
So he sounds like one of your
students was fighting in the UFC.

211
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,230
How did he do? Oh, he
won. He was saying, Oh,

212
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:41,950
Z to win in the prelim thing of it
was, what's his name? Richard Walsh.

213
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:45,280
Filthy rich. Okay, cool. Cool. Yeah,
he was one of your students. Awesome.

214
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,040
He was on the flight paths and a
lot of people saw it, but he's,

215
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,370
I think he's going to be a straight
the face. Well, I was going to say,

216
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,590
should look up,
there's an article about him online.

217
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:57,550
If you type in the face of
MMA in Australia, cal Noke,
right. He's the big guy,

218
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:01,360
right. It's the most famous and Hector
Lombard, a lot of folks don't know,

219
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,310
trained in Australia
when he got out of Cuba,

220
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,860
a lot of his fighting initially in
Australia before he fought for Bell Atar.

221
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,070
And then for the UFC, he's not
really Australian as such. But yeah,

222
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,920
you're looking at these amazing fighter.
I have to loves Australia.

223
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,290
He's an amazing fighter of course. But,
uh, I don't think we told them about, uh,

224
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,630
when we were in Canada and like how MMA
has gone down in Australia and it's shot

225
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:26,740
up in Canada. It's going down
now. So it's, it's, it's been, um,

226
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,330
tell lot of troubles since the first UFC
show. I don't know if it's, um, I dunno,

227
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:37,150
it's like my theory on it was basically
that we just kind of need someone coming

228
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,230
up that makes it, you know,
like, um, a lot of the guys
were fighting now like, uh,

229
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:45,880
Jamie and, um, to Hoonah and Anthony
portion them, they're, they're, um,

230
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,720
they're already quite established
before they hit, um, the UFC.

231
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:54,130
So I think on a, we need kind of like
a GSP sort of character, you know,

232
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,250
and every man sort of guy.
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

233
00:13:57,251 --> 00:14:01,670
Well you need someone who is like a
championship level fighter will look at in

234
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,480
Jamie is amazing. I, it's not that,
it's just that like, you know,

235
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:09,481
Dylan sing over here weighs about a
63 killers he did for now Isabella am.

236
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,530
But um, you know, there's no one for
him to really look up and go, man,

237
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:18,430
I can be that guy because a lot of the
guys are um, heavyweights in Australia.

238
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:20,220
You know, there's no real
light guys. Right, right.

239
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,380
I kind of think that's affecting the
scene a little bit. Maybe it's a,

240
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:25,480
it's a theory.
It's an interesting theory.

241
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,990
I think if you had a champion that
would immediately get everybody excited

242
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:33,470
behind it, JB to Hoonah as
possibly a, I mean a potential.
He's amazing. Yeah. Yeah.

243
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,040
Two is tough guy. Um, there's a,

244
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,730
there's a few Kyle know cause also
tough guy and um, you know, there's,

245
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,990
who else is fighting Australia, you know,
he got a hunt who's out in New Zealand.

246
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,030
Yeah. But it's, it's hard for like,

247
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,470
it's hard for kind of like a middle class
Australian kid too, or a rugby player,

248
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:52,310
which are often private school boys to

249
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,710
kind of look at some like Marchand
who's just amazing fighter.

250
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,690
Don't get me wrong. But
yeah, it's, it's not a, Oh,

251
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,240
that guy's led the way in
the way I'm going to do it.

252
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,500
No disrespect is an amazing fighter. You
know what I mean? I think, yeah, I think,

253
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,160
you know what I'm saying.

254
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,160
So you need someone who's like a wholesome
Australia and regular guy who the

255
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,250
folks can relate to.

256
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,500
Like go on a fucking great guy.
He's a great guy.

257
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,450
You know what I mean?
Yeah. No, I totally do.

258
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:24,050
I didn't know that a Australian MMA has
started to decline though. I didn't,

259
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:26,960
I wasn't aware of that. There's not a lot
of opportunity out there at the moment,

260
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,870
unfortunately. You know, like I'm, one
of our girls is fighting in the house.

261
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:31,750
I'm the one coming up and I'm in,

262
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,140
she was on hold for a year at a time
because there's just nothing going on.

263
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,470
You know, there's just a couple of
local promotions. But how, I mean,

264
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,870
most of the guys move over.
Steve's overstays.

265
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,980
I was thinking of something I was
playing overseas like Carl and, and um,

266
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:47,540
stay there, you know,
because they have to,

267
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,940
Brian Ebersol went to Australia as well,
didn't they?

268
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,260
It for a while over there for quite
a long time. Right. He's doing now.

269
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,900
He's in Thailand now living into,
yeah, he's having a bunch of issues,

270
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:59,860
like a physical issues. I didn't know
they had a tough guys had it. Yeah.

271
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,370
Very tough guy.
Very smart guy too.

272
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,510
Very crafty fighter inside a bunch of
back things is a few things going wrong.

273
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:08,450
Kept him out of action for
a while. Um, so anyway,

274
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,750
so how the fuck does a guy who is
having problems with concussions,

275
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,860
what, what was your rationalization
to not just go into Moy Tai,

276
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:22,850
but to become a more Thai world champion?
That's fucking bananas.

277
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,890
That seems like worse path you could
take if you've added head problems.

278
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,330
Yeah, I meant like, um, look,
we grew up to much, lots of
both Liam and I, you know,

279
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:35,120
dad would had karate
schools in South Africa.

280
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:39,800
We were born and I can be quite at schools
in Australia, so it was in our blood,

281
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,810
like we already were doing martial
arts, uncles boxes, et cetera. Um,

282
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,640
but my dad also racing motorbikes to
barefoot water skiing and look all the

283
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,860
barefoot water skiing.

284
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:51,650
So that was my first proper
sport with my dad and my uncle.

285
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,440
How the fuck are you barefoot water ski?

286
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,640
Do you want to tell them what they used to
do? Me, I mean, actually funny. No, it's,

287
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,290
if you look at his nose,
he tells everyone a broken kickboxing.

288
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,490
It was barefoot skiing.

289
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,230
They used to the Monkees to chuck
us a on the back of the boat, um,

290
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,790
in Sydney to set a small lake called
Brooklyn and used to be like, no,

291
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,940
you'll be fine. Just chuck us
on a surfboard, crank it up,

292
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,340
put their hand up, you know, you stick
your feet in. And I was like eight.

293
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,980
And then they will just drag
you behind his motorboat.

294
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,880
You gotta understand like South Africans
Sell Africans are what we call like a

295
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:30,020
white belt and nothing,
they've never walk barefooted before,

296
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:34,100
but they've got an idea of how to do
it. We saw a few videos, a few videos,

297
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,420
youtube. So this wasn't something
that they were like adept in.

298
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,390
They just give it a shot.

299
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,950
They did it behind a smaller boat when
her South Africa look where we used to

300
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:47,360
ski and they didn't know anything about
slumming. So they'd get 'em snow skis.

301
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,980
You'd,
you go on both

302
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,830
and then kick one off then
you'd have to go fetch it. Yeah.

303
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,930
Normally the one ski kick it off for that.
She hit you.

304
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,890
There's no lunch kicking off. What
do you mean? So, so basically, um,

305
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,950
like when you slalom slate Lumpski slaloms
sorry,

306
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,920
both a bit sick at the moment you
come up out of the water out of it.

307
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,200
But I dad and uncle and
didn't know how to do that.

308
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:13,560
So they just put you on two skis and
you'd kick one off and then go find it

309
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,120
later.
It's just,

310
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,480
that's every Saturday we have a bit
of a reputation of being a little bit

311
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,120
different. What it South Africa's a
kind of a crazy place, huh? To madness.

312
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,590
Absolute madness from Cape Cape Town's
not that mad. This is more Johannesburg,

313
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:34,320
Johannesburg. Cape Town is not that crazy.
Will you just went, it's not too bad.

314
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:39,321
I met Johannesburg and then you know like
we were driving back from a night out

315
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,460
and we had to cook our response to come
actually follow us back to our house

316
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:46,410
because we thought someone was
following me. The whole response,

317
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:51,411
that's the police ex Congo fighters
that like I'm hanging around the

318
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:56,280
neighborhood, which private security
guards with massive guns and cars.

319
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,280
So you just call them up, look and
walking home. Someone's looking at me,

320
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:02,260
you call the number and the car comes
and follows you home. You really,

321
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,900
I mean we're not from Janet.

322
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,130
I was in Johannesburg and I was staying
at a place called box book and I told my

323
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:10,940
other friends,
they want a nicer place in Johannesburg.

324
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,480
I was there for a wedding
and I was thinking pocketbook
book and my friends were

325
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:19,560
like, are you out of your mind? You know,
we had guides at the front with guns,

326
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:24,510
like securing the complex and everyone's
got dogs and I was on the phone to my

327
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:27,840
friend and across the road
there was a shootout. It's,

328
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,990
it's basically like a saint judge Dredd,

329
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,130
the the new one that's film
that's film, that thing. It's mad.

330
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,730
It's mad that you don't stop at Red
Lights. You don't stop at Red Lights,

331
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,330
but if you look at Shirley's, they're
on. They've got beautiful girls there,

332
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:45,780
so that makes up for it in a
way really so hard to shake up.

333
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,010
Cape Town's different than from, it's a
bit more like it's beautiful in the year,

334
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,640
so keep down safe fairly well.

335
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:59,940
I had a guy try get into my car when I
was there and I just drove another side

336
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:02,400
of the road and just disappeared.
They were,

337
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,800
one of the dangers is still and
came home and he's saying, you know,

338
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:08,700
kicked down safe. And I thought,
man, you know, it's not, it's safer,

339
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,950
but I wouldn't be relaxing. Like it's,
you know, Sydney, Sydney is very safe,

340
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,370
you know.
Yeah.

341
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,410
They did this thing on some television
show when they were talking about South

342
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,970
Africa and all the car jackings.

343
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,020
And so they had all these different
cards that they had wired up to prevent

344
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,080
carjackings mad that they have these
bars on the side of the car that blow

345
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:34,910
flames on anyone standing next to the car.
That's fucking crazy thing goes ready.

346
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,160
And my dad says, you know, if
we go to South Africa, he's
driving because you know,

347
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,980
you will, we don't, if people are lined up
across the road, I mean, Dylan, no Dylan,

348
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:48,250
I will stop. He says, and they just keep,
you can't into different to Cape Town,

349
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:50,590
but he's like, you know, they'll
stop you and then contact you.

350
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,800
The day I arrived there, I remember
seeing on, um, youtube was,

351
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:55,600
it was only a couple,
it was in November last year.

352
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,120
And I remember seeing a car pull up,

353
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,930
just put guns straight at that window
and they dragged like it was all over the

354
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,590
all over TV dragged, you know, like
four or five kids out of the car,

355
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,500
just throw him to the curb and just
drove off. They haven't got really, uh,

356
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,070
they're really care too much for life. You
understand? It's like, it's like Brazil.

357
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:12,461
People go,

358
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:15,820
why would you live there that you've got
a lot of potential to make money there,

359
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,570
you know, and you've got a
comfortable lifestyle. And
again, we're not from there,

360
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,600
but that's our friends who
are from Johannesburg. We say,

361
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:25,600
why or why the hell would you stay there?
Or they've been there for generations.

362
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,100
You can't bring the money out to,
can't bring the money out.

363
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:34,420
It's $1 Australian to 11 round. So when
I go there, I shut everyone burgers.

364
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:39,130
It's cheap for us. What does that even
mean? Will shout everyone. Burgers. Oh,

365
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,410
shots like shout as in like
pay for everyone forever.

366
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,030
It's funny when I'm sitting here,

367
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:45,560
I'm noticing he's talking
about South Africa and he,

368
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:49,890
his accent's becoming sell African. Is
it as we're talking about it, I'm a,

369
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,930
how old were you guys when you
left South Africa? One years old.

370
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
Well that's ridiculous.
How the fuck can you keep us out?

371
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,520
The African area went to city
even talk you were a baby. It's,

372
00:21:57,521 --> 00:22:01,180
we're from actually funny enough farm
and we're talking about accents. Nobody,

373
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,210
this whole trip has recognized that
accents as Australia because Australians

374
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,310
sound like kind of wait, Canadians crossed
with New Zealanders, you know, like,

375
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,920
cause we watched TV and we
listened to podcasts and stuff.

376
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:15,370
So you know what you have on your show.
I'm Jim Jeffries.

377
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,050
I mean when you listened to him you
think he's like Paul Hogan son, you know,

378
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,300
because when you come here to be
recognized, he does his farm. So knives,

379
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,560
which is where we're from. Yeah,
I've talked to him off podcast.

380
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:34,540
Not Quite as Australian where we're
from the same suburb. But look,

381
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:38,070
he's very funny. Hilarious, very far. Um,

382
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,800
is he most famous comic out of Australia?
I don't think he's,

383
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,020
I mean within the people that we know,
he's not that well known,

384
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:50,530
but I mean his every now and again
someone to come up and say, hey,

385
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:53,290
check this clip out. You know? And
he's brilliant obviously. Yeah,

386
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,920
he was telling me that a long time ago.
I want to know if that had changed,

387
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:59,200
that he was having a hard time in
Australia, that he was famous in America.

388
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:03,190
It was doing well in America but not so
well in Australia. Australians are weird.

389
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:05,230
Like if you're an American,
you come to Australia,

390
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,440
your accent will make you
funny or instantly, you know,

391
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:12,700
like think about our accent.
Like if I say ass say,

392
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:15,160
I mean in America it's not
tough. It's not funny. It's not,

393
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,380
well there's certain Comedians,
I don't want to name the names,

394
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:20,620
but there are certain comedians that
get a little bit of extra credit because

395
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:22,580
they have an English accent.
Like we'll,

396
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,570
we'll accept someone from another country
and we'll pretend that they're way

397
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,030
better than they really are.
And then you watch their comedy like,

398
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,490
like American College, like
the kind of dog shit. Like,

399
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:32,470
what's the fuck is going on Jackson?

400
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,470
No Irish is that adds charm
points instantly. A little bit.

401
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:39,700
He's got a Scottish accent as well. Um,
yeah, we, we, we like other accents.

402
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:42,670
I don't know what the fuck that's
about. Girls love it too, man.

403
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,980
Give me the girls love Australian
accents, right? Don't guys, can we pull it

404
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,650
off? You know, he says
get a, and every time we,

405
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,920
we have never said get that in Australia.
Nobody in Australia says good day,

406
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,170
but you meet a girl over here.
You throw it around like let her know.

407
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,073
We always say

408
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,490
that's the first question we get every
time from an American crews and Kangaroo

409
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,350
Kangaroos,
the furthest you can get on a plane.

410
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:17,240
What's the furthest flight you can make
in one shot? Is it Australia? La. Wow.

411
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,930
Yeah. It's pretty fun. No,
England's only 10 hours from here.

412
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,240
I was still at the Sydney is 16 long gas.

413
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,980
We haven't slept more than about four
hours for the last three weeks. Probably.

414
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:29,590
Like we're just not adjusting well.
Yeah,

415
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,700
I've done it twice and it's
a fucking brutal flight.

416
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,370
It's an awesome place though.
I've only been to Sydney.

417
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:36,890
That's the only place I've been in
Australia. I fucking love it, man.

418
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,730
If I was going to live outside
of America is on the shortlist.

419
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,880
It's the place where we are now.
I mean, not saying where it is,

420
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:46,700
but where we are now is very
similar to suburban Sydney.

421
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,150
We were driving around and we're
like, oh, this looks like ride,

422
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,560
but you're on the wrong side of the road.

423
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,580
We're on the wrong side of the escalator,
the wrong side of the road.

424
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,610
They don't start everything.

425
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,270
You know that awkward moment when you're
just like walking out of one of those

426
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:00,320
doors,
you know in Vegas,

427
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:03,710
who in Vegas yesterday and you walk into
someone and you normally shift to the

428
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:07,500
left or right. We got left because we
drive on the left. They shift. Right.

429
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:10,550
So we're both going the
same way. I'm like, buddy,

430
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:15,230
move without the way you move. Yeah.
He keeps saying, look at that car.

431
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,720
No one's driving it like we're
driving and I'm looking at that time.

432
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,140
There's no one in the front seat
because it's the wrong side.

433
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,180
Just sitting a kid
that baby's driving.

434
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,070
It's pretty scary,
man.

435
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,440
Our Lando and our driver was telling us
that oftentimes people come from Europe

436
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:35,780
or from England or where have
you and they in their countries,

437
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:38,630
they drive on the other side of the road.
So they'd come to Disneyworld,

438
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,770
get drunk and get on the wrong side of the
highway. Well, he doesn't let me drive.

439
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:44,540
He doesn't trust me.
He is the mechanical guy.

440
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:47,900
I'm the directions and she got a
Mustang. So pretty happy about it. Oh,

441
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:51,380
you're very excited. Did you guys know
why the left side and the right side,

442
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:54,170
do you know what the origin of that shit
is? I heard an explanation, but I don't,

443
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,210
I'll tell you what it is the left side,

444
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:58,440
the reason why they did
it in England and uh,

445
00:25:58,441 --> 00:26:02,420
a lot of those countries is because it
was from way back in the day when people

446
00:26:02,421 --> 00:26:06,680
would ride horses because you wanted to
have your sword arm on the right hand

447
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:09,860
side. If someone was coming the other
way so you could fucking hack at them.

448
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,520
So we did American go wrong
where they decided no more war.

449
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,090
Fuck it. Maybe. Yeah, maybe it was.
Maybe Henry Ford was a fucking lefty.

450
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,030
I don't know. I don't know what
started it off. Well, it's fun. I mean,

451
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:26,660
our whole trip, we basically spend
the whole time, Josh, I mean you guys,

452
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,580
you guys in America looking around and
your drive and your board and this an

453
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,080
interstate, this and that. For us it's
like watching movies through our eyes.

454
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:39,260
You know, like we just drove past Sherman
oaks and I was watching no retreat,

455
00:26:39,261 --> 00:26:42,020
no surrender last week. And we were
just like, that's fucking Sherman oaks.

456
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:46,060
I took photos, no surrender, no retreat,
no surrender. You never saw that sort of,

457
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,920
that's a karate movie or something. But
back home in the day, the guy's name,

458
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,910
it was van dam's firsts. Oh, okay.

459
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,920
We're going to take photos.

460
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,580
That's [inaudible] areas and silly suburb.

461
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,730
I think we got stopped by there.
It is render.

462
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,750
We watched it last week.
It's the greatest.

463
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:11,290
Have you ever seen there's John
Claude van Damme reality show. Oh,

464
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,660
where he does a lot of coke
and then whatever these lawyer,

465
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,520
Mike will be happy about that. But
yeah, whenever he does a lot of coke,

466
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,370
it's still like go fuck himself.
I liked the guy too,

467
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,280
but his reality show is God
damn brilliant. He's such a,

468
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,950
he's so crazy. Oh, he's
so off the fucking chain.

469
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:33,620
Crazy that you watch his reality show
and you just like, he kept, kept talking,

470
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,960
keep talking about this fight that
he's going to have with the tie.

471
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:38,790
That's like 90 years old.
Well,

472
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:42,030
it doesn't matter that he's not having
a fight and he's just, you know it.

473
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:44,380
I know it. He knows it. Everyone
knows that that's filming it.

474
00:27:44,381 --> 00:27:49,320
It's like this weird charade that
he puts on where he pretends cries,

475
00:27:49,321 --> 00:27:51,300
where he starts talking about the fight.

476
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:55,110
I'm going to have to fight to show the
children I'm going to knock him out.

477
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,980
But it's like the way he talks, it's
like a character in a such a romantic,

478
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,720
like fake romantic, romantic,
like a romantic in a bad movie.

479
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:07,890
It's like he's become a guy who
speaks in bad dialogue. He's like,

480
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:11,850
become that guy. Well, I mean, I went
to ask you about that. Um, you know,

481
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:14,010
he still speaks to that accident,
had been living here forever.

482
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,620
So zone of Schwartzenegger right.
Does he live here? Oh, I mean,

483
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,130
I'm just saying I don't show,
it looks like he's in another country.

484
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,440
It's hard to tell. I, and one of them I
remember he's, he gets, has a spine match.

485
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,390
Just some random sheikh dude and
psychics India. Did you say? No,

486
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:30,210
I didn't see that
episode. He's um, but um,

487
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:33,660
they'll saying when we were up in Canada
or someone was saying to know GSP for

488
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:34,494
example,

489
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,870
has kept his accent and a certain level
because it's so recognizable and no,

490
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,320
I think that was true.

491
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:44,040
Somebody was saying that George lives
in Montreal and George George speaks

492
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,820
perfect French. I mean,
it's not his accent. I,

493
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,190
when I talked to George outside of the
octagon, he speaks exactly like that.

494
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:53,140
He does what he does. Yeah. He's
just, he's very authentic. We just,

495
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,851
the reason I bring it,

496
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:57,420
I was just wondering if like van dam's
handlers or George's handlers haven't

497
00:28:57,421 --> 00:28:59,100
kept him.
You know what I mean?

498
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:01,410
Like then if he started
talking like it's like this,

499
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,800
George doesn't have those
kinds of handlers. George
has trainers and you know,

500
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,040
Jujitsu coaches and mixed
martial arts training.

501
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:11,790
He doesn't have those kind of
handlers, but maybe, maybe, but van,

502
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,070
I mean George was just in
that Captain America movie,

503
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:17,640
but he really didn't talk all that much.
It was mostly him just kicking ass.

504
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:21,850
You know, it's fun movie.
Did you see Captain America?
Fucking, we watched three.

505
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,280
There's a problem with the movie and
obvious problem was that Captain America

506
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,980
knows the Hawk and he
doesn't call them right.

507
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:33,000
What isn't fucking world's about to end
and he knows this invincible green dude.

508
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,820
Why wouldn't you just go, hey
look, there's some shit going down.

509
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,850
I'm trying to get my ass kicked. I'll
be right back. I want to make a call.

510
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,820
The hall comes flying in it.
I'm just fucking smashes everything.

511
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:45,670
The movie's over in 10 minutes.
You know that all those dudes,

512
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:49,210
like if captain America's Duking it out
with those dudes and they're going blow

513
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:53,950
for blow, the hug finishes everything in
five seconds to fucking movie is over.

514
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,790
No, no plot to take over the world.
It's over. It's over. Everybody rest,

515
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,180
rest assured that sleep tight
that the Ed Norton went on TV.

516
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:04,090
The other Vegas Hixon yeah,

517
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:07,870
with Hickson and the first 45 minutes
of the movie or a him avoiding wrecking

518
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:12,340
stuff. You know, like he doesn't even do
anything. Just 45. The mark was his name.

519
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:15,550
Mark Ruffalo. Is that his name?
Fall. Yeah, that guy. He's awesome.

520
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,540
He's the best banner ever. Here's
another piece of American Trivia. Uh,

521
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,990
the, in the comic books,
his name is Bruce Banner,

522
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,300
but when they made the television show,

523
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:28,330
they changed it to David Banner
because they think Bruce is a gay name.

524
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,750
That's how silly we are.

525
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,710
We're fucking so we love
America are a silly shit man.

526
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:40,300
So back to you man. How the fuck did the
route get right back to that question.

527
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,540
How the fuck do you go from having too
many concussions in motorcycle racing?

528
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,100
How many concussions did
you have by the way? Um,

529
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,560
have blocks at about four big accidents
on the track. So four out cold.

530
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,350
Kod flatlined probably that three.

531
00:30:56,351 --> 00:31:00,790
If it has three hospitalizations
from head injuries,

532
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,450
um Oh, that was just
from the motorbikes. Um,

533
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,320
well you didn't wreck your body. No, it's
actually all right. That's all right.

534
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,390
So let's just head injuries. Um,
yeah, a couple of, to be honest,

535
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:16,450
we that she had no major injuries
from barefoot water skiing,

536
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,970
fighting racy blacks.
That's incredible.

537
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,790
It's not the pool riding recently that
didn't got to, it was the worst thing.

538
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:25,300
You shut the fuck up. You
started go riding. Yeah.

539
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:29,110
So you're the manliest man alive.
You only do sandwich shit.

540
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,570
That's the funny thing I
loved pool riders could find,

541
00:31:33,571 --> 00:31:36,430
only started getting into it.
Like you love bull riding.

542
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,480
Well I put my shoulder landed upside down.
You kind of stopped doing this time.

543
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,600
We had a guy on fear factor that had
been a professional bull rider and he had

544
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,610
just had scars all over his shoulder.
Hip.

545
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:51,310
We constructed like eight times and
he said that anything goes wrong,

546
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,670
plop, it just pops out on his
shoulders. Just loose as fuck.

547
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,610
Well the thing is the hospital called
me and my friends call me. Oh yeah,

548
00:31:57,611 --> 00:32:01,210
Dylan's dislocated his shoulder.
I'm like, all right, here we go. Um,

549
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,520
I'm in the hospital,
my dad full 12 times a year.

550
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,450
Just always little things to storage,
stupid things, you know, but,

551
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,530
but they call me and I was just like,
tell them till doing, I'm fucking happy.

552
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,360
He just got his shoulder.
Could it be got to talk?

553
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,590
That's a big difference in the volume.
It's a bit intimidating looking at it.

554
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,880
I always think of it used to it.

555
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,220
It can't be when you say it that that's
a black Dick joke for those at home that

556
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:33,100
are listening, not watching,
but he'd just called out to me.

557
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,850
So the first thing I did was I was like,
fuck your brother.

558
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,160
I was like basically just like fuck you.
This is because we are in the academy

559
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,860
together as fuck you.
You brought you descheduled shoulder.

560
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,710
You're lucky it wasn't your neck hung
up the phone and I'm not even going to

561
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:49,120
deal with it because I'm just like,
why are you glad you're writing? Look,

562
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,100
I retired from fighting about a year ago,
year and a half ago.

563
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:54,060
It'd be living in Thailand
on and off for a long time.

564
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:57,890
And it's a very hard thing for people
that are like, you know, eight, nine,

565
00:32:57,891 --> 00:32:59,960
10 years in. They create, I
mean look at John Wayne pose.

566
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,960
Actually a good friend of mine.
Yeah, I love that 10 great guy.

567
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:06,580
And you couldn't say one bad thing
about dark grape grape. Great fighter.

568
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,380
Great Guy. Really good guy.
You got to get him on the show.

569
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,680
I love it.
So funny.

570
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,550
I met him for the first time about
a year ago when he came to the UFC.

571
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:19,730
I got him tickets for the
fights. Well that guy, big fan.

572
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,820
I went to ask you a question about that
being a celebrity of sorts. I mean,

573
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:27,200
you are a celebrity I
guess. Um, absolutely. Um,

574
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,860
I was just don't like to kind of like
recognize celebrity to some degree.

575
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:32,480
Like they feel embarrassed,
you know.

576
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:34,990
But one thing I was going to
say is looking on the Internet,

577
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,000
I want to know how you deal with this
and I'm taking it off topic again. Sorry.

578
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,090
But um, you know, like some guy comes up
to me the other day and he's like, ah,

579
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:43,790
Wayne par. Yeah. Here is all fake.
He's a dick and this and that. No,

580
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,800
he's absolutely not fake. Absolutely. Like
he'd got up at 9:00 AM hangover to do,

581
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:53,600
to treat one of our students to pads. Like
he's the genuine, nicest dude. I agree.

582
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:58,310
But it just seems like you can't be a
celebrity without some Dick just just

583
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,010
shut, right? Yeah. Making
shit up about, well,

584
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:04,670
eventually you realize that the only
type of people that would do that,

585
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:07,640
they would attack you
for no reason or idiots.

586
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,390
So if you're going to live your life
worrying about idiots or worrying about

587
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:12,590
bitter negative people,

588
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,950
some people are actually smart.

589
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,010
Some people will attack you and they're
smart and they write these scathing

590
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:20,250
negative things about you that are
not true, not based on reality.

591
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:23,470
They make these judgements of you.
They decide who,

592
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,630
how you think and they flavor you
and their, their, their posts there,

593
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,000
whether it's a message
board post or a blog post,

594
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,380
but they're just negative people.

595
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,680
And then there's a real problem with
being able to post on the internet,

596
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,850
whether it's posting on a message
forum or whether it's making a blog.

597
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:43,290
And that problem is, it's not
a, you're not interacting,

598
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,970
you're just putting out a thing, which
is fine. You know, there's, there's,

599
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,350
there's good to that because you know,
you could read things that people write,

600
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:56,640
whether it's a blog post or a message
board forum posts like on the underground

601
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:01,110
that could be very informative
and fascinating, but also
you can decide to fly,

602
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:05,160
you know,
Liam is obsessed with himself.

603
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,860
His ideas are bullshit,
his ideas are,

604
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,130
and you can just go on and on
and on with all of this, uh,

605
00:35:11,131 --> 00:35:16,131
add homonyms and all these fallacies
about a person and the person's not there

606
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:19,710
to respond. And so if that person reads
it like, no, I'm not what the fuck ass,

607
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,430
but this is not a conversation.

608
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,370
And those kind of interactions
would never take place.

609
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,740
If someone was in front of you, if they
were in front of John Wayne, Paul, John,

610
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,640
where he pours food, he's
bullshit and John, wait, probably
wait, Tom, about my, yeah,

611
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,790
well they wouldn't say to them and
that they did that. He'd be like, okay,

612
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,800
well how am I faking? Explain how
I'm fake. And you be like, well,

613
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:43,170
I've never done that. Like what is
this guide book would just be like, oh,

614
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:47,550
that's your problem. It just wouldn't
even react. And he's a self actualize,

615
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,810
you know, he's got personal sovereignty.
He doesn't need a fucking idiots.

616
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,870
He's their opinion of him to,
to define him.

617
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,080
But people will try to define you and
they'll try to define you and a bunch of

618
00:35:58,081 --> 00:35:59,550
ways.
But most of the time,

619
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,100
the reason why they tried to
define you is cause their failures.

620
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,010
Whether they're personal failures,
whether they're professional failures,

621
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,830
their failures, their life
in some way, shape or form.

622
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:11,760
If they don't have a real interaction,
like you didn't steal from them,

623
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:13,380
you didn't do anything to them personally.

624
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:14,610
If they don't have a real beef with you,

625
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:17,190
they just decide to
start attacking you all.

626
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,210
Most always it's because they're losers.
Yeah.

627
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,390
So you're dealing with a pool of
people that are almost all failures.

628
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,010
What they see in you,
if they,

629
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,660
whether it's John Wayne part like John
Wayne part is a multiple time world

630
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:35,070
champion.
I mean he's a bona fide bad motherfucker.

631
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:36,780
I mean he's a guy that look at him.
There he is right there.

632
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,160
And George St Pierre brought him
in to help him with his kickboxing.

633
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:44,480
I mean he's just, he's,
he's his legitimate, again,

634
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,440
when we're going to
fucking stack of belts.

635
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,730
Well a guy who sees a guy
like that and you, you know,

636
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,910
men measure themselves against other men,
they don't like it.

637
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,900
Imagine is Ebay store. I have had fucking
conversation with someone like a, Hey,

638
00:36:57,901 --> 00:36:59,040
what's up? Hey, how are you doing?

639
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,160
And then fucking that one person will
tell someone else some 20 minutes story

640
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:08,070
about what a Douche I was. Cause I
didn't say, Hey, what's up the right way.

641
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,521
You know,

642
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:12,750
people just decide that they're going
to define you because defining you in a

643
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:17,751
negative way somehow or another makes
them feel less bad about how they compare

644
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:20,790
themselves to you. When they compare
themselves to guy like John Wayne par,

645
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,930
they come up short. I mean, he's a
fucking savage. He's a rare human being.

646
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,770
So you compare yourself to them. You don't
like it, hey, that guy's a fucking fake.

647
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:32,760
He to this. He said that people
love to just chop people down.

648
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,950
It's that crabs in a bucket mentality.
You know,

649
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:37,500
a crabs in a bucket is put a
bunch of crabs in a bucket.

650
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:39,750
They can never get out of that bucket
because as they're trying to get out of

651
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:43,830
the bucket, the other crabs
pull on them and drag them
down. Well, Hey, he actually,

652
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:46,050
I mean, you can talk about it
instead of me, Austin you, but um,

653
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,460
I mean for a fighter it must be terrible
because you can get knocked out and you

654
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:53,280
look silly when you're knocked out.
I mean, not silly, but I mean it's,

655
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:56,130
it's not a nice moment,
right?

656
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,750
This is a video of a guy coming up to
Rashad Evans with a photograph of when Leo

657
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,291
Machida knocked him out.

658
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:04,710
You know that famous photo cause he
got really knocked out and he was

659
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:08,550
unconscious. The Guy was asking Rashad
to sign it with a big smile on his face.

660
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:13,880
Well you stopped going dead after a logon.
Yeah, I had him just riding for me, man.

661
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,630
I was his publicist.
Yeah.

662
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,510
Basically I'll just take off the
internet and that there's other,

663
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,030
the other problem is this anon anonymity,

664
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,380
the ability to post something as you
know [inaudible] 69 you need to make some

665
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:29,370
fake name up and you could just say the
meanest shit about somebody you know,

666
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:31,230
instead of like a photo of you.

667
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:33,180
And here's my background
is where I went to school.

668
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:35,770
This is what I've accomplished in my life
and this is what I think about Dylan.

669
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,090
You know, instead of saying that, you
know, you just post some nonsense,

670
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:45,330
some fake account or fake name rather
anonymity with sensitive information and

671
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:48,430
insults, it just doesn't
work that way. When you,

672
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,490
the thing about insulting someone,
if you define someone in salt,

673
00:38:52,491 --> 00:38:56,200
someone most of the time there's like
an evaluation process during that

674
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:57,190
insulting,
like the guy,

675
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,170
like if someone's a fucking 300 pound
guy just shit his pants and he's calling

676
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:05,530
you a loser, it's really difficult to
take them seriously. It's like, oh,

677
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:09,370
I'm a loser. But you know, if
someone's an anonymous poster online,

678
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,190
all that evaluation kind of goes away.
It's like,

679
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,910
do you take that person's
opinion seriously? Yeah,

680
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,910
it is. Look at the underground. How many
fucking pros posting the underground,

681
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,520
where's the last time you saw John Jones
posting on the underground was the last

682
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:27,640
time. A lot of them work. They
go in to creep around, they look,

683
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:30,310
but when they post just
so many fucking assholes.

684
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:33,940
I mean Tito Ortiz is probably like one
of the last guys that stopped posting,

685
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:38,290
but even he gave up after a while. How
many times can you hear people anonymous,

686
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:41,230
14 year olds to shit all over you.
You know?

687
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,440
But I treat it like snake venom and I
feel like you get bit by a snake and you

688
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:47,740
could really get fucked up,

689
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,380
but if you get bit by a little
bit of snake venom every day,

690
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:54,820
you get immune to it.
That's how I look at it personally,

691
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,320
but it's an,

692
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:01,350
it's just a side effect of this stage
of interaction because there's not going

693
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:03,850
to be Indiana anonymity
and you know what I mean?

694
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,480
It's not going to be an anonymity
within the next decade or two decades or

695
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:08,350
whatever.
It's going to be.

696
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:12,880
Enjoy your privacy and your freedom now
because it's not going to exist 20 years,

697
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,450
30 years from now. It's just not in a way.

698
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,610
I mean for a guy like me,

699
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:22,300
it's normal because I'm already not
anonymous so I'm already out there,

700
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,330
but I think everyone's going
to be out there like that.

701
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,350
People are going to pretty much know as
much about you as as humanly possible.

702
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,330
Yeah. Well that's coming
on the show. It's funny,

703
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:33,010
we talked a lot about this and I'm,

704
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,790
one of the projects we're doing is
with that I'm with the growing down.

705
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:39,070
What is with a psychologist and he,

706
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:41,710
we were talking about it and being
on the show and stuff and you know,

707
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:45,640
we've got a business that we teach
kids, you know, we teach adults and um,

708
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:48,790
we teach a lot of sensitive people
and like a white collar area. Right.

709
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:53,440
And the psychologist friend of mine,
Jonathan back, he's a, he's on the,

710
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,940
on the other showed he um,

711
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,680
he took him a while to open up a little
bit because he was worried, you know,

712
00:40:59,681 --> 00:41:02,590
people get a lot of information about
you on these things, you know, and um,

713
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,080
they can judge you, they can use it
against you, this and that. Like,

714
00:41:05,081 --> 00:41:08,380
especially if you're somebody
who likes to talk like we do oil,

715
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:12,340
I suppose you do as well. And just give
opinions and think and shout things out.

716
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:15,540
It seems like it might be a little
bit dangerous. What did you write?

717
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,470
It looks like a Dick. What'd you
write? What? Just worn it? What?

718
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,960
Worrying about the effect of what
you say can have it a public scene.

719
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:25,900
Whereas if you're a buyer, you can say
whatever you want, you know? Right. Well,

720
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:26,141
yeah,

721
00:41:26,141 --> 00:41:28,630
there's definitely gonna be a lot of
people that judge your thoughts and your

722
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:31,330
opinions and how you express yourself.
But at the end of the day,

723
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:34,370
it forces you to evaluate your thoughts
and your opinions and how you express

724
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:37,250
yourself and you, you know, you have to,

725
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,300
you have to own your words and you have
to mean what you say and say what you

726
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:43,580
mean. And once you do that, you're
like, I'm comfortable with it.

727
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,660
There's not a single thing I've ever said
on this podcast that I feel like, man,

728
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:50,060
that really are really
fucked up when I said that,

729
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:51,940
because now people have a
different opinion of me. My,

730
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,070
my opinions that I say on the
podcast are well thought out.

731
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,340
And I'm lucky that I started
it, you know, later in my life,

732
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:01,790
I didn't do a podcast when I was 20
when I was a fucking idiot. You know,

733
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,560
I think back on that like, God dammit,
if there's podcasts from when I was 20,

734
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:10,580
oh my God, he could hold it against me
to the end of time because we all learn.

735
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:14,090
We have to be, if you're going to be
out there and you gotta to take chances,

736
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:17,270
you're going to fuck up. You know,
and you're going to fuck up socially,

737
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,520
intellectually, uh, along the ways.

738
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,420
The only way a person learns is by
trial and error, trial and error,

739
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:25,160
and absorbing information
from other sources.

740
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:28,780
Those are the way you learn on your
own by your own failures and your,

741
00:42:28,781 --> 00:42:30,100
your attempts at,
you know,

742
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,570
accomplishing things that you're
not really qualified to do.

743
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:36,380
And then you learn from other people's
information and from other people's

744
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:41,150
failures. But that's just what we do.
But when you fail online, man, you know,

745
00:42:41,151 --> 00:42:45,800
I mean, how many fucking knock out
animated gifs? If you seen, I mean,

746
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:50,610
for the longest time, remember that
Guy Fred Adish? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

747
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,970
Poor fucking guy was torch a Fred adish,

748
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:57,200
she's a guy who fought in UFC one and
he fought Johnny roads and Johnny roads

749
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:58,970
beat him down. And, uh,

750
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:02,780
there was a guy who started a website
called the Fred editor are rife for it,

751
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:05,220
fetal fighting style.
Like,

752
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,300
cause he curled up in a fetal position
what Johnny Rhodes has beaten them down.

753
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,830
So they were torturing this puff
fucking guy and he's, he's quite,

754
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:16,670
he's fought against since then. He had one
fight MMA. Well, you learn Jujitsu, Lee,

755
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,120
you know, it became a real MMA fighter and
yeah, I think he fought more than once,

756
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,070
but you know,
he's a legitimate martial artists.

757
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:26,060
He just like a lot of us back then,
before the UFC came along,

758
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,850
he didn't understand what
real fighting was about.

759
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:33,560
He thought that his karate was enough. I,
you know, when I was doing taekwondo, if,

760
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:36,800
uh, if the UFC had been around
when I had only done taekwondo,

761
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:39,230
I probably would've thought that taekwondo
is enough and somebody would have

762
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:43,640
taken me down and strangled me. Um,
when I first went into kickboxing,

763
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,120
it was a huge realization to me that I,

764
00:43:46,121 --> 00:43:50,180
I thought that taekwondo was enough and
that I was getting my face punched in.

765
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:53,570
I was like, oh my God, like there's
so many holes in this style.

766
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,290
And then I started more time and I'm like,
Oh God dammit kicking the legs.

767
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,470
And then it was Jujitsu. It was
like, oh well fucking Christ,

768
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,430
I've spent all this time doing this one
style that I thought was sufficient.

769
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,470
But that's what the UFC was all about.

770
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:10,070
It was exposing the world to the
effectiveness of real martial arts.

771
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,750
I'm laughing because I ended up doing
Jiu Jitsu extensively and he did white.

772
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:15,320
So I,

773
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,650
but he ended up doing Jujitsu because
every time we get into an argument over

774
00:44:18,651 --> 00:44:22,860
Mirc Jujitsu would wick,
oh yeah,

775
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:26,330
I'd take them down strangle.
Well,

776
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:30,440
most people have no idea how help us.
They are in the ground until it happens.

777
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:34,470
You have all these and you
know, Dana White and I had
this conversation in a day.

778
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:35,670
He used to joke around about it,

779
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:38,370
but he was still always think
if a guy tries to take me down,

780
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:41,430
I'm fucking hit him with an upper
cut and do this and do that.

781
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:46,320
Diana says in the old days,
I used to, not now, no.

782
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,430
He's like, I really thought that
before we went, we, you know,

783
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:53,420
we own the UFC before I started learning
about mixed martial arts. He's, it's,

784
00:44:53,421 --> 00:44:57,150
it's like we laugh about it
because everyone has these
preconceived notions and

785
00:44:57,151 --> 00:45:00,100
you don't realize how helpless you
are until you actually do it. Well,

786
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:03,480
he's got to bounce it to hit
you now, so I'm going to, well,

787
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,760
nobody's hitting anyway. He's a
sweetheart days. One of the nicest guys.

788
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,410
The point is that most people
have no idea how help us.

789
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:13,790
They really are until they
actually roll. Yeah. Hey, hey.

790
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,620
He proceeded to Jitsu quite
seriously for a while. As a result.

791
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,090
How frustrating is like, leave,
get the hell off the computer.

792
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,310
It's too easy. Right?
It's fucking frustrating.

793
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,860
He kind of just like near your brother
in the face. It's not, you know, you try,

794
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,600
try, try it. Well, I've
tried once the credit,

795
00:45:35,601 --> 00:45:37,180
well at least you're a martial
artists though. They're,

796
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:40,260
the really crazy thing is when you
get someone who has no martial arts

797
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:43,230
experience whatsoever and
you know, he'd go, okay, um,

798
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:46,980
lie on top of me and try to keep me
from strangling you. Ready, set, go.

799
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:49,530
And they'll try to like hold you in
place and then the next thing you know,

800
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:54,390
breath isn't fucking 10 seconds. They're
essentially a dead man. Yeah. You know,

801
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,593
it's,
it's,

802
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,860
that's the beautiful thing about Jujitsu
and that's what you Jitsu showed the

803
00:45:58,861 --> 00:46:02,550
world. But these poor guys like Fred
Edis and these poor guys that had to,

804
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:06,480
they had to be the reason why we learned,
we had to see these guys learn.

805
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,020
We had a c,
you know,

806
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,730
these guys get taken down art Jimmerson
with his boxing and one glove on.

807
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:12,360
You know,

808
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,630
we had to see these guys getting taken
down and our Jimmerson wants a rematch

809
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:17,970
with Royce Gracie and she's,
I can talk to him recently about it.

810
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,720
He's a bit cut a little bit,
taking a few of those.

811
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:25,530
But in Thailand, it's funny. Um,
it's getting a bit better now,

812
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:27,030
but every time we'd go,

813
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:30,240
there were a couple of places like super
that had a cage and the tires would be

814
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:33,210
like, yeah, I'm going to fight him. Amaze
soon. I've got a big heart, you know,

815
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:35,730
I can and clinch there
clinches ridiculous.

816
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,440
But when you hit the ground that
don't have the ability to relax,

817
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,660
they just don't, they
don't really get it. Yeah.

818
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:46,170
It's a shame but it's a very
different thing, you know,

819
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:50,940
especially a more or any,
any kind of striking going
from striking the grappling.

820
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,990
Like I've seen friends that are good
boxers and they got very good endurance

821
00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:57,840
like hitting the pads. They can hit the
bag for, you know, five, six rounds,

822
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:00,330
no problem there role for a minute.
And they were exhausted.

823
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,630
We just don't understand this.
A totally different style of moving,

824
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,610
conserving your energy is just
a, but you know those guys, man,

825
00:47:08,611 --> 00:47:12,900
we owe such a huge debt of gratitude to
the original UFC fighters because they

826
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:17,610
showed us with their own humiliation
in their losses. You know,

827
00:47:17,611 --> 00:47:20,400
and even guys who are like
bad ass is like Orlando Veit.

828
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,540
You remember that guy that Moitai
is going to be out of animal man,

829
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,370
the commentaries, oh, he'll
be out of this shortly.

830
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,800
Lucky is rem co Pardue

831
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,960
elbowed him into another universe.

832
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,370
That was a horrific knock out too because
he was trapped on it as giant judo guy

833
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,540
who just smashing him with elbows and
his head, his head is stuck there.

834
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:45,400
He's just Bong, bong. It's huge judo
guy just crushing him, you know?

835
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:48,400
And then he gets crushed by
Marco who os and the hoists,

836
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:51,970
Gracie and all these other people. We
learned, you know, we really learned what,

837
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,740
what real fighting is.

838
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:58,080
So many of us had all these like
crazy ideas of what fighting was.

839
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,230
I think I was like 12 and
I was in England. Oh, in
England. I went to England,

840
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,140
do some holiday family and they've said,
listen man did it.

841
00:48:06,141 --> 00:48:10,870
You got to get me this. Um, this crazy
cage fighting. It's illegal in Australia.

842
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:15,040
Like you couldn't add black in Australia.
What knows? You see one of those three?

843
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,310
Those three? Definitely two was the
first one that came out on video.

844
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:22,720
What year was this?
We watched it in about 25 I think.

845
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:24,700
But it was definitely three because voice,

846
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,790
I was expecting us to smash
everybody and then he pulled out.

847
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,650
So first we have watched because in
Australia we just didn't have access.

848
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:35,290
It was just, we used to trade
VHS tapes overseas, you know,

849
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:37,180
that was the only way we could do it.
Right.

850
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,240
Was that one of your businesses for yeah.

851
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,750
Well in high school I
couldn't get ahold of her.

852
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,900
So I had this UFC three tape and then I,

853
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:47,560
I legally sent it overseas
to trade it with somebody.

854
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,340
So I had to tapes and then we had three
tapes and then I'd trade three and I'd

855
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:52,660
have three tapes,
six tapes,

856
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,230
etc. But I remember we watched it and
we wait until everybody went downstairs

857
00:48:56,231 --> 00:48:59,830
cause we thought someone was going to die.
So we were huddled around the thing.

858
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:03,130
We pushed play and of course nobody
died because nothing back. Well,

859
00:49:03,131 --> 00:49:06,880
they could have though, man, because the
medical tests they did on those guys,

860
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,360
fucking nothing, man. You know,
there was nothing going on.

861
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:13,210
There's three people in there and
hope they survived. And Joseph,

862
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,660
it looks like he probably has been messing
around on a corner a little bit. Well,

863
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:19,630
you know, Joe signs in jail
now murdered someone now. No.

864
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,980
Well he murdered someone in jail,

865
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:25,570
but he went to jail because he was a
part of a gang rape. Yeah, they did a,

866
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,830
I don't know what happened.
You got arrested for something
else and they, uh, they,

867
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:33,550
they matched his DNA sample
with an unsolved gang rape.

868
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,960
I'm laughing at the giant cross. Anytime
you see someone that extreme, you know,

869
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:37,751
they're going the other way.

870
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:41,920
Short Joseline used to hang around the
comedy store and before he ever got

871
00:49:41,921 --> 00:49:45,280
arrested, and he was so weird,
man. He called everybody sir,

872
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,550
call you sir and mister and he
would hug everybody. He was really,

873
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:51,640
really weird man. It was a really
weird, cause he was like five foot,

874
00:49:51,641 --> 00:49:55,660
two inches jacked just in the, and he was
hanging around and everybody was like,

875
00:49:55,661 --> 00:49:58,690
this guy's fucking crazy.
It was like a weird dog that he was like,

876
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:02,700
you were hoping that didn't bite you. And
everybody's like, yeah, nice dog or cat,

877
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,850
you know in Australia,
you know like when we have weird dudes,

878
00:50:06,851 --> 00:50:10,990
you don't generally worry about um,
getting stabbed or shot in America.

879
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:14,620
It's a real concern with drugs and
stuff, but we just don't have, um,

880
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,850
you've done have that imminent
sense of danger that you guys,

881
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,250
obviously this is a safe,
the safe areas,

882
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:25,870
but you just don't hear about
it in Australia as much.
There's more fist fights.

883
00:50:25,871 --> 00:50:30,440
Is that what it is? Fist foot bottlings
as well. Bottlings are chosen.

884
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:34,870
That's fucking scary
shit. Coward, punching,

885
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,000
punching, sucker, punch,
hit. If you hit someone,

886
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,960
why you're intoxicated or even,
I don't know what the exact goal,

887
00:50:42,961 --> 00:50:46,920
it just got passed. It's
massive. Chelsea killed,

888
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:51,970
got hit and died by this big juice head
who said he was an MMA fighter and that

889
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,220
was bad. So he got sucker punched
and he got, well they were,

890
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:59,180
they were two or three kids arguing with
him. Uh, they will kind of like, you know,

891
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,800
well dressed sort of kids and the guy
hit one of them and then he fell and hit

892
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:07,690
his head. He hit his head and died. And
um, they want to change it to say, um,

893
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,670
it's not called a sucker punch or
king had, it's called a coward punch.

894
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,550
It's Australia kind of rallies
behind these odd things like that.

895
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:15,530
And now they've also made
it that you can't go out,

896
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,200
you can't come into a bar after a certain
time. I got locked down after this.

897
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,360
Doesn't mean we ain't got much,
but three o'clock, you can't,

898
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,530
whatever club you're in,
you've got to stay there. Like
you can't come and go, Huh?

899
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:30,800
What is that?
It they've got no common sense.

900
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:34,910
It's just a keep the decay down the
street. So when you go out with your wife,

901
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:38,750
they're waiting on the corner,
rejected from a club. So
it's worse. Well, you know,

902
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:39,081
I man,

903
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:43,160
the idea of having these places where
people consume the worst drug ever for

904
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:45,290
social behavior and
it's all over the world.

905
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:48,500
Alcohol is the worst drug ever for
social behavior. Lowers inhibitions,

906
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,410
makes you feel like a bad motherfucker
when you're not, gives you terrible,

907
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:52,730
shitty judgment.
I mean,

908
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:55,940
it's like the worst drug as far as
like getting involved in fights.

909
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:00,440
If we had pot clubs, if we had places
where all you could do with smoke pot,

910
00:52:00,441 --> 00:52:02,930
you go to a place and just
eat brownies and smoke pot,

911
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,160
there would be no fucking fights. Nobody
wants to fight on pot. They just don't,

912
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,830
even if you're thinking about fighting,
like I gotta go, I gotta get Outta here.

913
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:13,500
That's all. Canadians
are so nice, like crazy.

914
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:16,070
That is nice period because they're
not trying to take over the world.

915
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:21,110
Big fucking problems with, uh, America
is an, America has got this long,

916
00:52:21,111 --> 00:52:24,800
deep history of trying to take over the
world or defend against other people

917
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:25,880
trying to take over the world.

918
00:52:25,881 --> 00:52:29,810
So it's just fucking group of
psychopaths live in writer. Neat.

919
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:31,880
These nice folks to the
north. Yeah. Well, no,

920
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:36,080
he just went to Quebec and Montreal
was beautiful. Zack, he's wicked fun.

921
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:39,410
Fantastic. Oh, the Canadians are
the nicest people in the world.

922
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,650
That's the other short list place
that I would move to Vancouver.

923
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:45,050
You ever been to Vancouver? We went
there for one another. God Damn.

924
00:52:45,051 --> 00:52:48,080
That place is awesome. Amazing. So, uh,

925
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:53,081
another city that I really thought about
moving there in 2004 after a Bush won a

926
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:57,110
reelection,
I really thought about moving.

927
00:52:57,111 --> 00:52:59,240
I was cause like everybody's so
fucking crazy. He wanted again,

928
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:01,340
like how could he win and
how the fuck did that guy,

929
00:53:01,341 --> 00:53:04,160
when after all this nonsense
that everybody knows about him,

930
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,740
it's crazy fake war that
they drag this into.

931
00:53:06,741 --> 00:53:10,550
It's not a real war under fake pretenses,
but I was like,

932
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,840
this country is going to turn into some
banana fucking republic police state.

933
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,330
Like we gotta get Outta here for us
living in Australia. I mean it's,

934
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:21,660
it's a very much a candidate.
It's very relaxed and um,

935
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:25,650
it's almost a little bit too fortunate.
And I had a friend move here because he,

936
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:28,680
um, he just said it's really easy
in Australia to be middle class,

937
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,860
but it's very difficult to make a lot
of money and be upper class and there's,

938
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,470
there's just, America
just has that kind of, um,

939
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,800
the ability to [inaudible] move
up as a bit of romance. Right.

940
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,820
Maybe you don't see it as for us.
We see it. I can imagine. Yeah.

941
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:46,710
I could see that they did the caste
system and the class system that exists in

942
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,190
England and exists in a lot of
other places in the world. Yeah.

943
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,740
I think it was a really bad,
isn't heavy. Some of the,

944
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:56,400
we went to Manchester and it was a
bunch of rough kids walking around with

945
00:53:56,401 --> 00:54:00,330
babies because they give them, um, they
give them a house if you have a kid.

946
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:04,410
So there's 16 year old girls
everywhere with baby baby.

947
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:07,690
I'm pushing the pram,
socialize,

948
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,370
socialization. It was pretty funny to
watch this young chicks everywhere.

949
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:16,350
Kids and red hair. That's weird.
I didn't know that. It's a,

950
00:54:16,351 --> 00:54:21,270
that was like our families there as
well. Socialist ideas. I mean there's,

951
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:23,820
there's, there's good things
to it. Like healthcare.

952
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:26,560
I really think that's one of the big
problems that we have in America.

953
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,100
And they try this good, like the
way they're fixing that in America.

954
00:54:29,101 --> 00:54:30,720
It's like fucking up even more.

955
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,490
Obamacare and the affordable care act,
it's got so much,

956
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,500
so many people are angry about it.
But,

957
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,970
but I think that the principle behind
public health care should be that.

958
00:54:41,971 --> 00:54:44,940
That's like one of the first things that
a government takes care of first things

959
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:48,870
that a society or civilization takes care
of me. What should everybody have? Well,

960
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:50,610
everybody should have
access to healthcare.

961
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,230
I mean she'd be like
one of the first things.

962
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:56,400
It shouldn't be that everyone has to go
by it though the day of they force you

963
00:54:56,401 --> 00:55:00,210
to go buy it. I mean it's
this weird sort of, you know,

964
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,770
we have the money to,

965
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:06,060
to start wars and finance
these overseas campaigns,

966
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:09,900
but we don't have enough money to take
care of the health of the citizens based

967
00:55:09,901 --> 00:55:13,290
on the tax revenue that we generate. And
I think that's just crazy. Well, you guys,

968
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:16,740
you guys have to keep crap job's just
to keep your health set care right.

969
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:17,574
Sometimes many people,

970
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:21,360
too many people take and keep jobs
just specifically for their health.

971
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:23,850
Takes advantage of the health care
system in Australia. That's for sure.

972
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:28,740
Back to the whole of Australia have gone
up because it'd be fucking bull riding.

973
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:31,650
So back to the thing.
So you,

974
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:36,600
you have all these fucking cush
concussions for three big ones,

975
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:37,501
three,

976
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:42,501
three out cold from motorcycle riding
and you decided to go into Moitai um,

977
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,100
tell them what you want it to do in
between then and why you got into Moitai.

978
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,000
So basically I decided
to join Israeli hobby.

979
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,640
We've got family over there as well.
And this school I went to,

980
00:55:56,641 --> 00:55:59,550
some of them decided to go over there.
I was dating Israeli girl as well.

981
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,640
I thought I'd go to the
Israeli army and I was 18.

982
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:07,500
I thought a good joint would be a
good experience cause my dad was the

983
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:11,370
paratrooper dog unit in South
Africa. So I was like, hell yeah,

984
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,920
this is, this is the brains of, yeah.
This is the sort of, the thing is,

985
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:21,921
is this girl's moment convincing him to
go to the Israeli army romance decent.

986
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,440
Israel is very romantic

987
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,110
and meanwhile she's moved to Australia,

988
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,640
so her daughter doesn't have to
go to the fucking off the charts,

989
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:34,240
get a baby for sure. If I go down,
it's like, so that's why you,

990
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,960
so how do you join the Israeli army when
you're living in Australia and you're

991
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:42,790
Australian citizen? Born in South
Africa. It's voluntary. It's voluntary.

992
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:47,420
So they'll take anybody from
a Jewish background. Um,

993
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,750
it's voluntary.
You could join the Israeli army.

994
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,540
So you're from a Jewish background,
that's all you need is correct.

995
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:57,420
It's all your name. That's all you
needed. Wow. Really? Diversity. Oh really?

996
00:56:57,421 --> 00:57:00,700
It's up to three years
of pretty active duty.

997
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:04,270
So you go over there,
you're 18 you join the Israeli army.

998
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:08,070
I didn't quite make it there,
so I told my parents and my dad was,

999
00:57:08,071 --> 00:57:09,770
tell your parents.
That's the whole point of the story.

1000
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:14,110
I told them that three days before
it's going. Why did you tell them?

1001
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,470
I'm terrified of my dad.

1002
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:22,480
He's like the nicest guy ever to just
went out of the, I said that. Um, yeah.

1003
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,490
And they're like an eight.
I'll go ahead and get the big guilt trip.

1004
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:27,900
I cancelled it. I had a plane ticket.
I'm like, screw this labor ready.

1005
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,790
I mean he's a couple years older than me,
so like screw this,

1006
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:33,370
I'm going to go to the toilet. They
want the same ticket. My parents like,

1007
00:57:33,371 --> 00:57:35,710
you're going to Thailand,
we're paying for him to go with you.

1008
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:36,640
I went as a chaperone,

1009
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:41,400
all expenses paid first night we
arrive there when straight to seven 11.

1010
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:42,910
Got a massive bottle of Samsung.

1011
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:48,290
It's a tie whiskey and just got like
absolutely drunk off my head on um,

1012
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:51,580
coach San Road Bangkok,
which is like a bad area,

1013
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,510
but it's not a bad trash. It's, it's a,

1014
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:58,450
it's like the Vegas trip friendlier.
You know,

1015
00:57:58,451 --> 00:58:03,200
it's a bunch of cuts friendlier than the
Vegas trip. Well not if, well look, it's,

1016
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:05,870
it's basically backpackers central.
Um,

1017
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,710
everybody's very friendly cause they
usually straight out of school and they're

1018
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:12,310
free and the way they're fisherman pants
and drinking and smoking cigarettes

1019
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:17,970
going there just for vacations.
Gross. Oh city. Okay.

1020
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:19,930
So lovely. So, but you're not alone.

1021
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:22,840
There's probably a bunch of other people
drunk like that too. They got him drunk.

1022
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,090
Yeah, I got, I got the,

1023
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:27,700
the the ironic thing that got drunk or
the corner with the homeless Israeli guy.

1024
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:31,270
Yeah. It was the funniest part of
all of them in a lot of Israelis.

1025
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:35,740
That's hilarious. So then ever since
then I was like, man, I love this,

1026
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,670
this fighting business.

1027
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:39,830
Like I was ready boxing's does
young liberals do Jiu Jitsu?

1028
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,270
Obviously I looked up to him or I was
doing Moitai and thought I was good at it

1029
00:58:43,271 --> 00:58:45,940
and then he got 10 times better than me.
I was like screw this man,

1030
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:46,721
I'm just going to live here.

1031
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:51,390
And just kind of kept going back and
loved living there. And what will,

1032
00:58:51,391 --> 00:58:56,260
what was it that like forced you to like
make that decision? Like, what, what,

1033
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:01,210
what triggered in your mind to like, Yo,
okay now one more tie fighter. Yeah. Look,

1034
00:59:01,211 --> 00:59:04,270
I've been at school wash. Dot. You
know, I did so much struggle at school,

1035
00:59:04,271 --> 00:59:08,320
but you know,
I have add share on 80 days.

1036
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:14,950
It's even remotely interesting.
Yeah, it is struggling. I thought,

1037
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:15,191
you know,

1038
00:59:15,191 --> 00:59:19,480
like all the be something good and boy
wasn't established in Australia yet.

1039
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,250
Like there was no wind power was still

1040
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,120
very good.

1041
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:26,390
But it's something that you sell in
Wales is a video on the thread on the

1042
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:29,780
underground. Um, I mean on a
message board of him fighting,

1043
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:34,120
pull it up so we could put it on
while we're talking. Yeah. Yeah.

1044
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,570
It was a video of you
finding out my message.

1045
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,010
It is a world championship title fight.

1046
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:43,940
That's the one he got no to ask him about
that actually that was the second time

1047
00:59:43,941 --> 00:59:47,900
and his whole career he got knocked out.
Like to actually watch yourself.

1048
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:50,540
And I've watched this a few times
when we find in there. Yeah,

1049
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,640
that's Sunny d from New Zealand. A really
good fighter. Um, this was actually,

1050
00:59:55,641 --> 00:59:58,400
I was still getting told to this day
some of the people's favorite fights

1051
00:59:58,401 --> 01:00:03,300
because we kept dropping each other
in it. And, um, this is quite an,

1052
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,300
that's my coach Nick Stone. Um,
yeah, I just didn't have a good eye,

1053
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,930
good training camp for it. I
just, you know, it was kind of a,

1054
01:00:11,931 --> 01:00:16,240
I wouldn't go that look, it's, I was
getting, I had too many coaches, whereas,

1055
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,770
you know, I should have had one
that we've looked everything.

1056
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,830
And you're getting contradictory
information. Is that what it is?

1057
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:25,220
We didn't really like the prom was with
moisture in Australia and he's got to

1058
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:28,100
coach Nick Stone who is a brilliant
coach, but it's, um, you know,

1059
01:00:28,101 --> 01:00:31,070
we had a bit of boxing, a little bit
nutrition, a bit of this, a bit of that.

1060
01:00:31,071 --> 01:00:35,030
And it's,
it wasn't how we coach our students.

1061
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,220
It was just basically do
a little bit of boxing,

1062
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:40,340
a little bit of running wish for the best.
Like it wasn't,

1063
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:44,430
you weren't totally organized
that were saying, yeah. You know,

1064
01:00:44,431 --> 01:00:47,450
I can always go back and forth between
Thailand's he know the tires like no, no,

1065
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:51,540
no, you kicked like this. And he'd come
back to Australia and off. Fuck this guy.

1066
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:54,560
What was the difference between the
way the ties told you to kick and the

1067
01:00:54,561 --> 01:00:58,250
Australians told you to kick? The tires
are more dominant in clinch elbows,

1068
01:00:58,251 --> 01:01:00,380
knees and kicks,
especially clutches.

1069
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:04,100
What I love the most about
Whitesides is my favorite thing. Um,

1070
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:08,730
whereas Australia and you
generally find like Sun even out,

1071
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:11,420
I'm just watching the video now
is very well known for his hands.

1072
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,630
So the whole career only took about 12
to 13 hits to my head in all my flights.

1073
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:21,140
Real was wasn't someone, if you watch and
again 12 to 13 hits ever to your head,

1074
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:23,820
how's that possible? Many you have? Oh,

1075
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,890
34 34 fights in only 12
to 13 hits to the head.

1076
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,350
I like to stand when you say that.

1077
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:39,000
Right. But um, it's gets really
excited. Get around my tie.

1078
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:43,130
Fighters take much less
damage than boxers. Um,

1079
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,750
it depends.
Um,

1080
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:48,800
you know like I really a lot of the
articles in the MMA forums and stuff and

1081
01:01:48,801 --> 01:01:52,280
these guys coming out saying the
damage is getting done in the training.

1082
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:55,850
It's not getting done in the cage.
Right. For me, my trading Thailand,

1083
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:57,850
we don't even really spa.
We do a lot of clinch,

1084
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:01,280
a bit of play spidery lot of pad work,
a lot of groundwork.

1085
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:05,780
Well they have a down more, you know
in my opinion is about MMA sparring.

1086
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,960
The real problem is that MMA in
America and MMA as a sport in general,

1087
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:12,770
it's still very young.

1088
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:18,040
It's a very young sports and there is
a lot of people that got into MMA that

1089
01:02:18,351 --> 01:02:22,320
really did not know how to
properly train for striking.

1090
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:26,790
Absolutely properly trained as far as
like what kind of damage you do long term.

1091
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:31,910
If you spar really fucking hard all the
time and it looks as always have had a

1092
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:36,480
history of, you know Jim was and much.
Yeah. See the thing is like when,

1093
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:38,280
when Americans went to Thailand,

1094
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,310
they saw the ties training and
they copied it and brought it back.

1095
01:02:41,311 --> 01:02:43,560
And this has happened in Australia a lot.
Um,

1096
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,850
it's one of those flat to constant watch
you when you stop, that's what happened.

1097
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:51,600
Yeah. Sounds sick. But um, the problem
is that they watched the ties to it.

1098
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,180
And this is like anything, when
you go overseas, you do yoga,

1099
01:02:54,181 --> 01:02:57,480
you do [inaudible] whatever art you're
doing, cooking, whatever it is, right.

1100
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,900
And then watching the Thais do
it and the ties go pads, bag,

1101
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:03,510
work clinch and that's it.

1102
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,030
So the Americans had come back in a
strength come back and copy of that,

1103
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:09,930
but they forget the ties don't spar for
one reason. They fight every weekend,

1104
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:13,410
you know, so from a young kid so they
don't spoil. Why would they spar?

1105
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,160
That's right. So right. So
I mean, I think like, um,

1106
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:22,560
that was lacking and clinch is really
lacking in western countries. But um,

1107
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,740
ties don't, if you watch him fight,
have you been to Thailand? Jury? No.

1108
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,550
You going to watch them fly around
the fourth round? If one guy has one,

1109
01:03:29,551 --> 01:03:32,550
they stopped fighting in the fifth
round so that they can fight next week.

1110
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:35,840
They know who's one already,
you know the first round that I go hard.

1111
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,650
They don't dry elbows for the first round.

1112
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:40,560
Normally there's a lot of
that sort of stuff in India.

1113
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:44,250
They go slow in the first round. Is that
because they also want to place bets?

1114
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:49,220
There's big part of the
adrenaline adrenaline. Well,

1115
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:52,330
because the adrenaline will take
a bit to kick in like two. Um, I,

1116
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,930
it's like the plum harm down
and find your rhythm. Look,

1117
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:57,210
the problem with Thai boxing
is like he's been, how long?

1118
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:01,860
How many times have you been 26.
26 times. I've been about seven.

1119
01:04:01,861 --> 01:04:02,790
16,
17.

1120
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:07,080
It was on about our 10th trip that a
tie actually explained the rules to us.

1121
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:12,510
Saxon. Yes. Sex Saxon. Right. And it's
like [inaudible] no, I wish, but no,

1122
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:16,880
that's that. He's an, he's an American and
Axon is a, the name of the gym sessions.

1123
01:04:16,881 --> 01:04:20,040
A guy he beat, um, you
know, some core, some cores,

1124
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:24,180
like the best kicker in Thailand.
He was just, hey look, a,

1125
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:25,730
you become the best kicker at Tyler.

1126
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,320
Oh some cores whose country
is known for a while.

1127
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,270
But this guy explained the rules to
us and we're thinking Jesus like Ooh,

1128
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,640
beautiful. Knocked down. By the way,

1129
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:38,760
that was not illegal for people that
actually lived in Thailand and kept saying

1130
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:39,330
it was illegal.

1131
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:42,540
Why was it illegal as long as long as
you throw the cake before they're down,

1132
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:44,940
you can kick.
Sometimes they land on the ropes,

1133
01:04:44,941 --> 01:04:48,780
he can still hit them as long as they
didn't hit like the floor. Oh I saw that.

1134
01:04:48,781 --> 01:04:53,680
Its critics out there. But what was the
point of this? To me down, we're tight.

1135
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:56,010
Thai, Thai boxing. One of the
misunderstandings, people don't,

1136
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,790
they don't understand
like you know the ties,

1137
01:04:57,791 --> 01:05:00,440
they won't fight in the fifth
round. They won't use, you know,

1138
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,920
elbows usually in the first couple
of silicon cottage and then the,

1139
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,670
and that was illegal right here.
Bridge from this fight.

1140
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,860
Really one shot to the back
of the head while you're down.

1141
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:17,920
Um, yeah you were down. Totally mucked
style. It's in how got a little bit dirty.

1142
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,460
It happens again. Wow. Side
of Brady. Everybody try it.

1143
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:25,360
I remember going to the hospital for
awhile and this was the fight that

1144
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:26,680
convinced you to stop fighting.

1145
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:31,360
I had a one or two flights health
to this and yeah, no big deal.

1146
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:36,260
Just a brain hemorrhage. Yeah.
Wanted to fund. They have
to drain your brain. No, no.

1147
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:39,410
It was only a small blade,
but it was enough to, yeah,

1148
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:44,260
you look like you're certainly a
wobbly here. Oh, I keep going. Damn.

1149
01:05:44,261 --> 01:05:47,440
The thing about about it, this fellow that
is, man, it didn't have to be this way,

1150
01:05:47,441 --> 01:05:50,170
like if you didn't get hit on the
back of the head and then again being

1151
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:53,440
dangerous. You know what I
mean? Right. I like it. It's,

1152
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:58,080
I hate to say like when people hear
us say that it's the sport and Moitai.

1153
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:03,020
Is Jen really quiet,
pretty safe compared to boxing or rugby?

1154
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:05,580
Rugby's a horrible smell.
Love sport by them.

1155
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:09,070
And how is it safe when you're dealing
with head kicks and Shins and knees?

1156
01:06:09,071 --> 01:06:11,160
I mean, how many head shots
have you seen this? Oh,

1157
01:06:11,161 --> 01:06:13,660
he dropped him with a head kick.
This is a crazy fight, man,

1158
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,230
that could fuck holy shit to get dropped
like that and get punched in the head

1159
01:06:17,231 --> 01:06:17,981
while you're down.

1160
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:21,070
Then get punched in the head again and
dropped and then dropped him with a head

1161
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:23,620
kick. And then I think he wasn't
cheap back of the head again.

1162
01:06:23,621 --> 01:06:26,230
But it was only when I kind of went down.
Oh.

1163
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,300
So I think this flight
had changed to South Pole.

1164
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:33,370
That's coming of at one of my lady flights
were changed to South Pole. It's wild.

1165
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:34,390
Um,

1166
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:39,390
so the difference in the way the ties
fight being that they fight like almost

1167
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:44,650
every weekend and then they train.
But even their sparring,

1168
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:46,180
they don't go at it full blast.

1169
01:06:46,181 --> 01:06:49,000
Like the Dutch who don't
fight as much as the ties,

1170
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,520
they throw hard kicks to
the legs into the bodies,

1171
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:53,890
but they throw light or
punches to the head. He says,

1172
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:57,610
we were in Holland about a year
ago training at MIT at all.

1173
01:06:57,611 --> 01:07:00,420
I wouldn't say which
Jim, but um, men that's,

1174
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:03,160
there's a punching each other's
heads through the wall. Oh Man.

1175
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:07,200
Especially when the jet, um, I
was maturer ratios. Jim's crazy.

1176
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:11,050
That's a great gym by the way. If you have
it, go there. Have you been there? No.

1177
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:15,550
Well there's the used to be a Magiro
gym in Encino as a Guy Shuki from Magiro

1178
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:18,730
gym and uh, Holland came to
America. He was here for a while.

1179
01:07:18,731 --> 01:07:22,450
He's an Israeli as well. Uh, he went
back to Israel though. Well, anyway,

1180
01:07:22,451 --> 01:07:25,690
go to the locker room and just be prepared
to keep your eyes facing straight.

1181
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,440
Yes.

1182
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,190
There's group showers and everybody's
naked guys and girls talking and chatting

1183
01:07:30,191 --> 01:07:33,760
after training. We weren't ready for
that. Yeah, wouldn't you be ready for that

1184
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:40,060
next to none of the guys would
go shower together as great.

1185
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:45,340
Beautiful. Back to the garden of Eden.
What? We weren't ready for it. Wow.

1186
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,250
That's cool. So she's a kill
each other and trying to know.

1187
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:51,490
So how did you decide though,

1188
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,660
like that you were okay doing this?
That was a beautiful head kicked man.

1189
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:59,410
How did you decide that you were okay
doing this after like retiring from

1190
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:02,080
motorcycle racing because of concussions?
I mean,

1191
01:08:02,081 --> 01:08:04,600
you weren't worried about
these concussions like this.

1192
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,580
That's some bullshit right there.
Like I hit you aren't,

1193
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:09,070
that should have been the end of
the fight. Yeah, I kept going.

1194
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,020
There's another one
coming up. Um, but look,

1195
01:08:11,021 --> 01:08:13,540
I can't take it away from this
sky to get off topic cause he,

1196
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:16,130
Sonny is a top flight. Oh,
he definitely is. But he's

1197
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:20,020
also, if he's a dirty
bitch, I not going to lie.

1198
01:08:20,021 --> 01:08:21,410
Doing actually has a
lot of respect for him.

1199
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:25,120
I woke up for about three months after
this fight dreaming about strangling. Oh,

1200
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,680
that was the first fight.
He's a lovely guy.

1201
01:08:27,681 --> 01:08:32,150
Everyone tells me I get up every morning.
I woke up dreaming. I was just like,

1202
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:35,270
squeeze it. You hit him when
he was down to payback bitch.

1203
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,430
Crazy fight, man. That's a crazy fight.

1204
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:44,840
This is the first time you really got
hurt and your whole career down in Jamaica

1205
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,100
on a big show, but not so
dehydrated. We were like, oh yeah,

1206
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:53,030
my coaches are going to be one 35
pounds. I'm like, Oh yeah, 62 kilograms.

1207
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:57,050
I get there. And Stevie Kennedy's,
uh, one of my coaches as well.

1208
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:01,730
He's a heavyweight. Um, I'm
thinking, you know, one 35 pounds,

1209
01:09:01,731 --> 01:09:05,450
it's probably around 61 62 didn't
think about it and get there. I'm like,

1210
01:09:05,451 --> 01:09:08,890
shit man, I got a cut. Like I
swear to you, end up 58 killers.

1211
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:11,180
It was like 58.7 or something
and had to get done.

1212
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:16,020
I don't even know what the weight was. I
was like, 64 kilograms is Jamaica. Wow.

1213
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:21,050
Pounds. How many kilos it
was, you're talking about
you're talking to eight kilos,

1214
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,150
eight kilos off. How's about
five or six? Six, seven, six.

1215
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,470
Let's say six. So six is, is 2.2 pounds.

1216
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:33,660
Jesus Christ. And back then
we didn't like, you know,

1217
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,950
we didn't know many of the cutting
methods to sit at the site for five hours

1218
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,110
saying about sang about this.
You know what?

1219
01:09:39,111 --> 01:09:43,610
I'm sure it's the same for you with
everything you do. Like we didn't, we now,

1220
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:48,560
the way we coach, how we didn't know back
then or how we want it to be coached.

1221
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:52,040
So we just didn't know, you know, so
he'd just go jump in a sauna suit.

1222
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,500
And so what we did. You just did it. Yeah.

1223
01:09:54,501 --> 01:09:58,190
There was a lot of really bad weight
cutting it in the UFC back in the day.

1224
01:09:58,191 --> 01:10:02,010
I used to cut weight to fight in
taekwondo tournaments. I cut the day off.

1225
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:07,260
I would get down to 140 pounds the day
of the fight and he's going off my hair.

1226
01:10:07,261 --> 01:10:10,640
1617 yeah. It was terrible for
a very dangerous they will.

1227
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:14,960
That was the thing about boxing while
they changed it to a Wayans the day before

1228
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:18,380
the fight because they give the
fighter a chance to rehydrate.

1229
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:21,290
The big issue was brain injuries too.

1230
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,960
Dehydrated fighter or more substantial.

1231
01:10:23,961 --> 01:10:27,830
Of course I found out that almost all
the deaths and boxing came and outside of

1232
01:10:27,831 --> 01:10:30,860
the heavyweight division in
the heavyweight division,
there was no deaths. Yeah.

1233
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,190
That's one of the things he attributed to.
This is not cool to watch.

1234
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:37,550
It's one of those flights will be the
greatest fight ever if you weren't the

1235
01:10:37,551 --> 01:10:40,310
guys probably I made the best highlight
of this. It was just me hitting him.

1236
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:42,520
If we don't have to watch it again.
It's cool.

1237
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:46,820
It's cool cause you can keep going cause
I want to ask good questions but um,

1238
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:49,550
yeah,
there's a theory now they're saying that.

1239
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:51,050
And I was saying to one of my guys,

1240
01:10:51,051 --> 01:10:54,140
because we just went to the UFC and he
cut about five pounds and everyone keeps

1241
01:10:54,141 --> 01:10:57,650
saying you need to drop down a weight
division. Right? Yeah. This is not cool.

1242
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:01,550
That's it then that was not cool.
There's the end of the fight.

1243
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,330
That was the back of the head shot again.
How's it going? We can kill off Jim.

1244
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:07,690
What's your view on that? Sorry. Um,

1245
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:11,060
so that you fired two times
more after that. How many,

1246
01:11:11,061 --> 01:11:13,950
how many MMA fights or excuse me,
I'm more Thai. Did you have total

1247
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,650
I had a couple of like,
um,

1248
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:20,400
you know we kept my record down cause
I was fighting to Thailand a lot.

1249
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:21,810
So if those guys,

1250
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:26,590
I've never been passed around to hit
Thailand in 1617 flights everywhere.

1251
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:31,830
So all up we, we found a lot of
tapes and probably about 30, 34.

1252
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:35,200
Yeah, there's a lot of fun.
Dodgy towards the end. Yeah.

1253
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:37,620
I started finding bigger ties
and just like, there's some,

1254
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:41,030
there's some good ones on youtube
of I'll be fighting is twice a year.

1255
01:11:41,031 --> 01:11:45,130
I dropped him like 15 times
the Calbert get tropic.

1256
01:11:45,131 --> 01:11:48,270
Those guys just keep getting back
up. So I don't know. I didn't really,

1257
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:50,820
it didn't bother me fighting tonight.
You've got little kids,

1258
01:11:50,821 --> 01:11:53,460
eight year olds that are fighting
and it makes you feel, you know,

1259
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:57,180
in Australia when it fought, it's like
you go backstage, got to rev yourself up.

1260
01:11:57,570 --> 01:12:00,480
You've got all your friends. There you go.
You know, it's the crowded, it's music.

1261
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:04,950
Thailand, there's like eight nine, 10 15
year olds all sit in the back with him.

1262
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,640
Mommy's taping the hands. You watch
them fight for, I taped their own hands.

1263
01:12:08,641 --> 01:12:11,700
That's right. Yeah, yeah. You
know, they, they fight for
like 15 minutes. You're like,

1264
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:15,290
oh, this isn't so bad. You know? So it
was pretty more relaxed environment,

1265
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:19,140
easier going into the fight.
Absolutely. Playing as well.

1266
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:23,150
And I was normally in the main event
being like the Westerner and I started

1267
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,640
finding some really good tires to subcu.
Really started towards the end.

1268
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:30,330
Getting a little bit dodgy like cause
ties are very proud people and other very

1269
01:12:30,331 --> 01:12:31,560
similar Japanese like that.

1270
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:35,550
And they started kind of slipping in
the bigger dude's and snapping in the,

1271
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:39,450
there was one fight actually showed
me where he was actually winning.

1272
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:43,480
And you throw me just to get his shoulder,
but it was a bit scary until then.

1273
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:46,950
Kicked me in the head is a big boy.
So when you say bigger dudes,

1274
01:12:46,951 --> 01:12:50,310
you mean like the wrong way class
outside of your weight class?

1275
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,940
Like ringer's ringer's after a while.
Are they bigger than you?

1276
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,960
The legs. They're trying to
set you up. They didn't really,

1277
01:12:57,961 --> 01:13:01,710
they didn't really weigh you do though.
Now we here anyway. I just, most of them,

1278
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:06,560
most of them were either weight or
heavier earlier on. They used to Ab bits.

1279
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,380
Um, yeah, later on they're just
kind of all about my size or bigger,

1280
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:14,310
which I was okay with. It
was still good fun. Wow.

1281
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:19,460
So you far over there for many years
and were you there when the tsunami hit?

1282
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,560
Yeah, so excuse me. Um,

1283
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:27,190
basically the story with this,
um,

1284
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,870
I don't think I even written
this online, but basically, um,

1285
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:34,570
we wake up and Yanks who actually
the other side of Thailand and um,

1286
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:37,860
my brother and I and Cobain Yang and I
was still staying there for quite a while,

1287
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:41,170
having some fights and my brother's like,
listen man,

1288
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:44,640
I'm going back to Sydney call say cup
or a bit of money on my Kia suede.

1289
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:47,160
Like I had so much in my bank.
I was like 20.

1290
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:50,100
And he went and took it and
he entered the pin card role.

1291
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,110
So he entered the pin number wrong when
you put the card in. And I was like,

1292
01:13:55,111 --> 01:13:57,570
great, such swallowed my car.
I was like, I'll fucking great.

1293
01:13:57,571 --> 01:14:00,840
So I'm stuck here in Copen Yang,
which is like the full moon party,

1294
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,490
like crazy party island.

1295
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:07,530
And I had to wait like four days to
get a replacement card. In that time,

1296
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,930
my friend had two doctors
that lived in Melbourne,

1297
01:14:09,931 --> 01:14:12,850
Glen and Tom and I met them a few
times. One time. I said, listen,

1298
01:14:12,851 --> 01:14:14,650
you guys go to PP island,

1299
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:19,360
you go to the other side of Thailand where
we wanted to spend years in Christmas.

1300
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,120
And I said to him, well, you guys go
there and I'll meet you over there.

1301
01:14:22,121 --> 01:14:25,450
I've got to wait from our placement cuddle
still. Therefore a couple more weeks,

1302
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,880
I'm sorry,
a couple more months in Thailand.

1303
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,400
So they went over there
and then it's tsunami hit.

1304
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:35,530
So in a way I kind of miss it and army
because of my brother. So I'm like,

1305
01:14:35,531 --> 01:14:38,680
okay, well like screw this,
I'm going to go look for them.

1306
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:43,060
And we didn't know what actually happened
because the media is often run by

1307
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:45,850
governments and we didn't
really know what was going on.

1308
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:49,360
So we had ours a bit of a wave and um,
yeah,

1309
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:51,820
basically where there's a bit of a
wave and you know, I thought, oh,

1310
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:56,500
we'll try help out. I'll go look for my
mates. So I could, I got a friend, um,

1311
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:59,560
to write entire saying, I'm head of
the Australian Search and rescue.

1312
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,450
So I went over there with a,

1313
01:15:01,451 --> 01:15:04,720
another South African friend who I'd met
who is now a very good friend of mine.

1314
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:08,350
And they're like, okay, cool. You
guys are in charge of um, pick up.

1315
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:11,080
The bodies were like, yeah, this
is just fucking great. Yeah.

1316
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,450
And we've got more involved and you know,

1317
01:15:13,451 --> 01:15:16,970
there was those 1500 bodies when Ppi
island, we, it carry all of them.

1318
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,930
There was just a couple of
volunteers and stuff. Wow.

1319
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:23,170
And then after a couple
of weeks we're like, well,

1320
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:28,060
we tried to do a few other things. Um,
you know, we, you know, those things,

1321
01:15:28,061 --> 01:15:31,300
they wanted us to start cleaning up
because a lot of disease on the island

1322
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,520
because of the buyers,
because of the body.

1323
01:15:33,521 --> 01:15:36,010
So then the animal study
eating the bodies as well. Oh.

1324
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:41,030
So bodies would be washing up, you know,
all the time. What kind of animals? Um,

1325
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:45,040
what actually happened during the
tsunami was in Ppi on its flat.

1326
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,260
It has got two hills on the other,
on both sides,

1327
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:51,380
and that the animals must have detected.
There's a lot of articles on that,

1328
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:51,910
on the Internet.

1329
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:55,660
I detected that the slammers coming in
and they actually all went into the hills.

1330
01:15:56,110 --> 01:16:01,000
So there was like, do you like dogs,
cats, birds, whatever. Um, there's a goat.

1331
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:04,660
We found running around, like loosened
a lot there and I was doing, um,

1332
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,930
they started in the bodies and
then they got sick as well. How?

1333
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:10,990
It's only a small island. Um,
and those, you know, I was like,

1334
01:16:10,991 --> 01:16:14,830
how big are crosses it he'll walk
from one side, you hover, it's not,

1335
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:17,950
it's not that big. But um, yeah.
So, and then I was like, well shit,

1336
01:16:17,951 --> 01:16:20,480
I bet it's keep looking for my friends.
So we went through the bodies with,

1337
01:16:20,481 --> 01:16:24,100
through the pictures in the morgue, went
to the morgue. Meanwhile, these two,

1338
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:27,100
two monkeys, they're both
fun. They're both doctors.

1339
01:16:27,101 --> 01:16:31,450
And I actually had gone across to PB
on, it's a bit of a trip, you know,

1340
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:35,050
like ferry, bus, ferry, two
monkeys, none. I if I, two,

1341
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:40,200
two friends that are doctors, you don't
really mean really monkeys, monkeys.

1342
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:43,170
We came tongue.
Um,

1343
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:48,680
and basically they met some girls on the
bus across and into, stayed in hotel.

1344
01:16:48,681 --> 01:16:50,290
And I don't know what
the hell they were doing.

1345
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:55,000
So I'm looking for them in the tsunami
and I pick up bodies and do all types of

1346
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:57,760
crazy things we probably shouldn't have.
And um,

1347
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:00,220
and they were just on the mainland
hang out with these two girls

1348
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:05,230
so it all where they there to find
them and they'll just chilling out. Um,

1349
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:10,190
but you know, Alisha, I suffered a
lot of, um, not so much, but more so,

1350
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:14,720
uh, post traumatic stress
off doesn't it? 20, 21. Um,

1351
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:18,290
yeah and stuff. A lot of post
traumatic stress and um, you know,

1352
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:22,140
it ate that much and just
from the bodies will PTSD.

1353
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:26,450
He wasn't really like talked about as
much as the stage, you know, like I,

1354
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:29,030
I felt like I was a warrior as I call
it. They're not talking about this. Yeah.

1355
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,820
To be fair, my mom was like, don't
even think about going over there.

1356
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:34,460
And I was like, yeah, hell no, you
don't. No mom, don't worry about it.

1357
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,560
Don't worry about it. Yeah. When
straight straight over there.

1358
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:37,910
And we had some cool experience.

1359
01:17:37,911 --> 01:17:41,160
Like every day I could write a book on
the things that we did and what happened.

1360
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:46,160
And that's the idea actually. Yeah.
When you say post traumatic stress,

1361
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:50,090
like specifically, like what, what
was the feeling like what did you,

1362
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:55,070
what was the issue that you had
from seeing all that horrific shit?

1363
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:58,610
Um, look, you know, I mean folks were
actually what happened when I came back,

1364
01:17:58,611 --> 01:18:00,860
my prints split the day I
got back from the tsunami,

1365
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:05,870
so they split and my brother and I
would just in the house alone. So, um,

1366
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,410
I dunno, like, you know, we'd be what?

1367
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:10,990
She was a bad boys two as your favorite
movie. Yeah. I love that close to there.

1368
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:15,980
He loved that. Wow. You really did get
hit in the head a lot. It's cool man.

1369
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:20,500
Um, yeah, bad boys two and you know, we'll
see the bodies in this way. You're like,

1370
01:18:20,501 --> 01:18:24,530
everybody's there much sick. Will Smith
so bad boys two, what would happen those,

1371
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:28,460
that same with the morgues and
stuff like that and bodies and yeah,

1372
01:18:28,461 --> 01:18:33,050
like a little bit of a flashback and
yeah, that, it was just kind of hard.

1373
01:18:33,051 --> 01:18:35,540
It wasn't something I talked about.
It wasn't something I was proud of.

1374
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:38,090
I was like, Oh man, I put
everyone out. You know,

1375
01:18:38,091 --> 01:18:39,380
I probably shouldn't have done that.

1376
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:43,070
And they're a bit of guilt as well where
you only told me some of the stories,

1377
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:46,370
quite recently talked to him about
it. That's one of the reasons I, um,

1378
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:51,440
I put that post up because
we were so busy in Sydney.

1379
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:53,300
Everything's always
moving, moving, moving.

1380
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,520
We never actually sat
down and talked about it.

1381
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:58,310
All I know is he had some trouble, you
know, and we see each other every day,

1382
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:01,820
you know, but just, it's never just
come up in conversation, you know.

1383
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:05,300
So today on the way here we were talking
into the plane stuff or toy and I'm

1384
01:19:05,301 --> 01:19:09,240
like, I've never heard of these
stories. Has some cool stories. Yeah.

1385
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:11,540
Which is strange. It's
strange I guess. But uh,

1386
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:15,020
that's what it is for a 20 year old.
I think it kind of,

1387
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:19,580
I grew up very quickly and I went
back to Thailand a lot since then. Um,

1388
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,610
yeah, those, those cool
experience. I later,

1389
01:19:22,611 --> 01:19:24,960
like now I've been
working for the customer,

1390
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:28,760
we rescue team for about three years now,
so I'm the only Westerner that does it.

1391
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,700
Only idiot. Yeah. What is the rescue team?

1392
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:36,430
What does this in Koh Samui they've got
private ambulances and then they got

1393
01:19:36,431 --> 01:19:40,490
volunteer and there's the rescue teams
of like a boat flips or there's a car

1394
01:19:40,491 --> 01:19:44,240
crash or local sick or someone
dies or there's a lot, you know,

1395
01:19:44,241 --> 01:19:46,370
there's a lot of black acts and
stuff, you know, we go click,

1396
01:19:46,371 --> 01:19:48,530
the bodies are lingered on Westerners.
Yeah,

1397
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:51,110
we go like patch him up and take him
to the hospital and it's a bit of

1398
01:19:51,111 --> 01:19:53,750
everything. You know, there's
a fire where they're like,

1399
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:57,410
we kind of Gi Joe kind of rescue me,
but I'm the only Westerner.

1400
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:02,330
So that led to that later on and I've had
some pretty cool experiences for three

1401
01:20:02,331 --> 01:20:05,630
years now. Just working a couple of
shifts a week with the Thai team.

1402
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,190
And you one shift of

1403
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:11,670
probably the hardest shift I had was
last February when I actually decided I'm

1404
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:15,270
going to retire and the cord limb
of sendlane retire. And I was like,

1405
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:17,430
if I'm gonna retire and
have to try that much.

1406
01:20:17,431 --> 01:20:21,420
So I spent a lot of time doing the rescue
team and over the full moon party on

1407
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:25,800
the island up from us in one shift from
11:00 AM until the next day 11:00 AM

1408
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:29,970
those like 30 accidents we
attended. Yeah. So it was pretty,

1409
01:20:29,971 --> 01:20:32,130
it was pretty hard to get
published, you know, as well.

1410
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:37,170
We're not really allowed to talk about
all of it, but most of it's, you know,

1411
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:41,420
western is drunk. Westerners just being
stupid. And I meant there's a girl, um,

1412
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,760
I think his sister is Nicole
Fitzgerald and her a young sister,

1413
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:49,690
Kate and Nicole.
Um,

1414
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:52,740
it was on the back of a bike and I don't
know if there's a western a and got hit

1415
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:57,741
by a truck and she died and now
I know she promotes safety for,

1416
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:04,400
for riding and transport in the Asian
countries because a lot of like a lot of

1417
01:21:04,711 --> 01:21:09,600
Australians are dying folio flag
balconies and p kit and to stupid stuff.

1418
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:13,770
Just being drunk and [inaudible].
Yeah. Thailand's amazing.

1419
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:18,180
Make it sound worse. Like, this is the
worst part of it. It's amazing place.

1420
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:22,200
But people just go there and it's um,
you know, the ties are lovely people,

1421
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,600
beautiful people.
Very patriotic.

1422
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:27,390
Like if the king of you don't
talk badly about their king,

1423
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:28,820
if you're going to have a pension,

1424
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:31,260
they king or you've been to the
movies there and what happens?

1425
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:33,960
You have to stand up
and king for the king.

1426
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,530
It's like 10 minutes and one
west and I'm an idiot. Um,

1427
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:42,170
refused to stand up and they just, of
course warm happen would happen. Like, um,

1428
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,690
don't know what happened. Exactly. I
just know he was taken away. Basically.

1429
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:49,050
They'd beat his ass. Yeah. I mean
they're not, they're kind people.

1430
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:50,760
So I don't know if they'd beat his ass,

1431
01:21:50,761 --> 01:21:53,490
but they would have find him or
arrested him. You don't know. Wow.

1432
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:55,770
Just for not standing up at
the movie theater for the king.

1433
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:59,150
I think he got arrested.
So talking back to their country folk,

1434
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,760
everybody who goes to,
you know,

1435
01:22:00,761 --> 01:22:05,761
like right now you go there and you go
to these places and the key with going

1436
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:10,940
overseas and you've traveled quite a
lot of, of course we travel like a lot.

1437
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:12,960
When you go to someone's country,

1438
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:17,320
you never go to the place where Westerners
hangout. I don't want to see Aussies,

1439
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:21,150
I don't see ties at deal with Ozzie's
cause the ties that deals with deal with

1440
01:22:21,151 --> 01:22:23,610
Aussies, they get that red. I'd
look and you know, they get,

1441
01:22:23,611 --> 01:22:28,010
it's just a little bit like they're not,
they, they become, I'm jaded. Right.

1442
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:33,270
So it's just like, um, you've got to go
to their country and respect it. You know,

1443
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:36,330
if you go to Thailand, then you
must, it's an amazing place.

1444
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:40,500
Don't go to an area where ties have to
deal with Westerners because then you've

1445
01:22:40,501 --> 01:22:43,830
got to deal with the tires that have to
deal with the West. Well that's, I mean,

1446
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:47,460
Hawaii is a part of
America. Um, but that's the,

1447
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:50,940
the argument that you always hear
about Hawaii is how the hate Americans,

1448
01:22:50,941 --> 01:22:55,470
but it's just because they're dealing
with Douche bags all the time. I mean,

1449
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:58,440
imagine the fucking idiots that you
have to deal with that are always on

1450
01:22:58,441 --> 01:23:02,190
vacation coming from all parts of the
world and they're all drunk and they're

1451
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:03,270
all, uh, you know,

1452
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:07,330
entitled because they're spending so
much money to get over there to act like

1453
01:23:07,331 --> 01:23:09,130
you should give a fuck about them.
You know,

1454
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,630
I've met people that are Hawaiians in
Hawaii that are some of the nicest,

1455
01:23:13,631 --> 01:23:15,790
kindest, coolest, sweetest
people you could ever meet.

1456
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:18,620
But then you'll talk to people,
all wines, hate Americans. Like

1457
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:23,410
maybe some, maybe for a
fucking good reason. You know,

1458
01:23:23,411 --> 01:23:27,820
maybe they have to deal with
dickheads, ties, ties, hate Israelis.

1459
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:30,810
Really because,
and Israelis have you been to,

1460
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:34,600
it's a lovely place I've ever been to
Israel imagined Copacabana without crime

1461
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:39,070
really. It's pretty much what it is. Tel
Aviv your full plate. No crime, no crime.

1462
01:23:39,071 --> 01:23:42,670
I mean the, the, you go girls, 18 year
old girls with machine guns on their back,

1463
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,820
you know, at Mcdonald's off
duty, you know, but wow,

1464
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:47,370
that's an underrated traveling places.

1465
01:23:47,371 --> 01:23:50,770
But everyone's so scared of the bones
and all that stuff. Don't worry about it.

1466
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:55,540
The point is they hate Israelis and
Thailand. So we'd go buy a motorbike,

1467
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,520
which anyone could have any girl,

1468
01:23:57,521 --> 01:24:00,820
Aussie girl who gets off the plane can
hire a motorbike, never driven one before.

1469
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:04,750
And um, we go high. What are they say? Oh
no, sorry, we can't lend you. And we say,

1470
01:24:04,751 --> 01:24:08,270
oh no, where Australian. They
go, oh, okay. We thought you
were Israeli. So, so what,

1471
01:24:08,271 --> 01:24:11,590
what, what the reason is Israelis
a nice people? It's not that,

1472
01:24:11,591 --> 01:24:15,640
it's just that the ones that go to
Thailand, uh, fresh out of the army,

1473
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:19,330
so they're, they're crazy. You know, like
they're just straight out of the army.

1474
01:24:19,331 --> 01:24:22,810
They've seen all this bad stuff and they
go to Thailand and they just smoke weed

1475
01:24:22,811 --> 01:24:26,050
and just go create that.
Whereas they just go crazy.

1476
01:24:26,051 --> 01:24:30,340
Basically mushrooms and everything
disrespectful towards the tires, alcohol,

1477
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:34,120
flights, whatever, you know, loud,
because they feel entitled after the army.

1478
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:37,870
But you know, the ties to like
them go there. They're nice people.

1479
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:42,380
Far off for the moment.
The young traveling Australians,

1480
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,850
the Russians aren't doing so good now.
The Russians have like,

1481
01:24:45,851 --> 01:24:50,140
there's a lot of Russians in coast movie
and the islands in the past two years

1482
01:24:50,141 --> 01:24:52,570
I've noticed, especially working
for the rescue team. I mean,

1483
01:24:52,571 --> 01:24:57,040
tell me more and more Russia
and they speak Russian, uh,
mobile, Russian accidents.

1484
01:24:57,070 --> 01:25:01,750
And because our last name is Latvian,
Russian really raised a lot of us.

1485
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,010
We thought it was Russia until about
a month theory, Pharaoh's Latvian. So

1486
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:12,780
basically a picture of a
cricket. Yeah. But now, you
know, when I went to hotels, um,

1487
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,180
and I can speak Thai,
so for me it's like I can get around it.

1488
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,510
They see my last name raise look off and
they're like, no, no, no, no, we're full.

1489
01:25:19,511 --> 01:25:23,830
I'm like, you gotta you're blind. It's
like 300 rooms. There's rooms open.

1490
01:25:23,831 --> 01:25:27,340
I could see them really speak to them
when their call and once they realize

1491
01:25:27,341 --> 01:25:31,510
you're Australian. Whoa. Yeah.
But if I spoke Thai, they
kind of really take you in.

1492
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,860
Oh, do you speak Thai? Oh,
it's a bit rough. And he's
very, he does, he's bloody shy.

1493
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:38,630
That's every time I said Dylan order for
us to speak to untie it. No, no, no, no.

1494
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:43,250
He speaks. But my team didn't speak
English at all. No one in my rescue team.

1495
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:47,010
So sometimes those
misinterpretations about, you know,

1496
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:49,900
I did interpret things properly when
they speak to me. Tired, they'd be like,

1497
01:25:49,901 --> 01:25:51,520
go over there and you know,

1498
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:53,830
like I'd drive to like the other
side of the island if I was,

1499
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:57,730
I was driving the ambulance
and uh, some some, yeah.

1500
01:25:57,731 --> 01:25:59,560
Not so funny because the one thing about,
um,

1501
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:03,800
one thing about Thailand people don't
know is that before the tsunami couldn't

1502
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,010
buy property, there are businesses,
unless you are under a Thai name,

1503
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:09,920
so you'd marry a Thai woman or a top man,
which is great.

1504
01:26:09,921 --> 01:26:13,970
I think that's a good thing. The tile ends
should be owned by tires, you know? Um,

1505
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:18,590
but after the tsunami, they allowed
foreign in this foreign investment.

1506
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,090
So if you go to [inaudible],
which is where the beach was film,

1507
01:26:21,091 --> 01:26:25,610
that's where he did his rescue stuff.
Um, I just not recognizable anymore,

1508
01:26:25,611 --> 01:26:25,851
you know,

1509
01:26:25,851 --> 01:26:29,390
so anybody can buy a business and
property there now that wasn't like that

1510
01:26:29,391 --> 01:26:31,580
before.
That's changed a lot because of that.

1511
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:35,240
I mean before that you've got people who
have to go round and round in circles

1512
01:26:35,241 --> 01:26:38,510
to set up businesses and brothels and
strip bars and stuff like that. You know,

1513
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:42,860
now just give him money. You can do
those Russian strip clubs in the middle.

1514
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:47,110
I'm a mom with Russian strippers in the
middle of like clubbing areas. Yeah.

1515
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,860
It's crazy. Yeah. I mean,
look, you've got to go.

1516
01:26:48,861 --> 01:26:52,370
It's an amazing place and the people are
amazing. That's small parts you know, of,

1517
01:26:52,371 --> 01:26:55,670
of timeout. Like there's still a lot of
untouched areas, especially up north.

1518
01:26:55,671 --> 01:26:56,390
There's amazing.

1519
01:26:56,390 --> 01:27:00,050
Do you think that it's going to change
irrevocably because of this though,

1520
01:27:00,051 --> 01:27:03,440
because of allowing Westerners to buy
businesses there is that kind of fuck

1521
01:27:03,441 --> 01:27:04,100
everything out?
Look,

1522
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:07,790
I know a lot of expats that live then
I'm a lot of South African expats as well

1523
01:27:07,791 --> 01:27:12,350
as a big ex ex pat community and it's
nice there, but like anywhere, like,

1524
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:16,090
like my brother said, you
know, there's bad areas, um,

1525
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:19,940
like specific bad areas and out of a
whole island it's only a small area.

1526
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,130
So now I didn't really
go back to them anymore.

1527
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:26,080
I restating that it's not exactly bad,
it's just this young people getting drunk,

1528
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:29,330
drunk, crazy, like spring
break all the time basically.

1529
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:33,250
When was the last time you went to spring
break? It's been a long time, you know,

1530
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:36,290
really into it. Even when I
was on spring break in college,

1531
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:37,260
I wasn't really into it and my dream,

1532
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:41,860
it seems really great place to
get stabbed isn't too crazy,

1533
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:44,870
isn't worth going well. I think whenever
you give someone the opportunity,

1534
01:27:44,871 --> 01:27:48,560
like this is the time, it's
New Year's Eve, let's go crazy.

1535
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:50,270
Like people go crazy on their own.

1536
01:27:50,271 --> 01:27:53,240
You don't need a big fucking a
day where they're allowed to go.

1537
01:27:53,241 --> 01:27:57,830
Crazy third party in Thailand, the
half Moon Party, the quarter moon pie.

1538
01:27:57,970 --> 01:28:02,900
And even more days to go, well, there's
a lot of clubs do New Year's Eve nights.

1539
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:04,670
They do stand up comedy shows.

1540
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:09,050
For the longest time I avoided those
just because I got tired of the drunk and

1541
01:28:09,051 --> 01:28:12,110
crowds on new year's or so crazy.
It just wasn't worth doing.

1542
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:17,590
But no telling where we spent
new years top and hunting,

1543
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,720
you have to tell you, well,
here's something for you.

1544
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:24,110
Every time we speak to an
American or Canadian, we spoke to,

1545
01:28:24,111 --> 01:28:26,360
there were these two
guys that, um, the UFC,

1546
01:28:26,361 --> 01:28:31,190
a Antonio Cavalla real nice guy and
his friend monkey, who's a really good,

1547
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:31,770
um,

1548
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:36,770
he doesn't use his real name and they
live up north in Canada and they hunt

1549
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:40,100
fucking bears and wolves.

1550
01:28:40,101 --> 01:28:44,960
And with automatic rifles in Australia,
you can only get single shot bolt action.

1551
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:46,130
And they're saying to me,
I'm like,

1552
01:28:46,131 --> 01:28:48,170
we're going to come next year and you
guys are going to take us hunting.

1553
01:28:48,171 --> 01:28:50,570
That's be fun. And he
says, he said, uh, I said,

1554
01:28:50,571 --> 01:28:52,820
why don't you come to Australia and
honey goes out of your fucking mind.

1555
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,750
I'm not coming to Australia. What do you
mean? He goes, come to Australia and hunt.

1556
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:58,940
You guys got the most
dangerous animals in the world.

1557
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:01,980
And I'm thinking like you just said,
you hunt wolves and

1558
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,813
bears.

1559
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:09,050
We the only thing that Brown
snakes [inaudible] south Wales,

1560
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:12,860
so there's no crocodiles.
Where are the crocodiles there?

1561
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:15,600
Up in the northern is and stuff.
You've got to be careful.

1562
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:20,000
You don't step in a puddle there
hiding underwater,

1563
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,600
terrifying scene where we are there.
But the thing is for us,

1564
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:29,010
like the scariest creatures and sees
a is a brown snake, which is deadly,

1565
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:33,000
but they don't want to be there if you're
hunting and bloody Canada that bears

1566
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:35,130
and polar bears, if you
keep going up, you know,

1567
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:40,320
bears and wolves of wall tacos
whenever any that attacks us.

1568
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:44,790
Yeah. Well the, so the crocodiles there
are limited to one part of the island.

1569
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:48,690
But what about the water? The swim.
Yeah, but I mean you're talking about,

1570
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:52,040
we're talking about like Bush
hunting, right? Like, like
in a Bush, right? But, uh,

1571
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:55,330
but swimming up on the
top side of Australia yet,

1572
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:57,750
don't just have to worry about sharks.
You have to worry about crocodiles,

1573
01:29:57,870 --> 01:30:01,150
crocodiles, and outreach. And what
part is that? What is the, the

1574
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:05,630
up above Queensland, Queensland
sort of upper along. Yeah,

1575
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:06,503
there's not much up there.

1576
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:09,840
Have you guys seen that guy who's a
claimed to be Jesus in Queensland?

1577
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:14,670
It's become a fairly famous
on the Internet. There was
a internet expo's a about,

1578
01:30:14,671 --> 01:30:18,900
um, some, uh, I believe is a British guy.
Went to a Queensland and talk to this guy.

1579
01:30:18,901 --> 01:30:21,960
He's got a huge colony of people up there.
That belief he's Jesus.

1580
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:27,090
He's got some woman with him that
he says Mary. So she's a whore.

1581
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:28,260
Well,
you know,

1582
01:30:28,261 --> 01:30:32,940
she's a reincarnated horse
or I don't think her herself,

1583
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:35,040
but a, apparently, uh,

1584
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:38,250
this guy's a causing a stir up there
and people are hoping he gets eaten by

1585
01:30:38,251 --> 01:30:42,750
crocodiles. He's got a good chance as
long as the puddle around says that bad.

1586
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:46,460
Um, in terms of the policy, I mean,

1587
01:30:46,461 --> 01:30:49,320
look the [inaudible] or anything
like that, right? Like a bear,

1588
01:30:49,321 --> 01:30:51,600
you could probably run around a
tree, like a black bear. I Dunno.

1589
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:54,990
I've never seen one. We're looking
at doing is actually doing three. No,

1590
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:56,310
I'm saying as in like a blackberry.

1591
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:59,950
You could probably shoot it
or climb or something. Right.
Not at, not a brown bear.

1592
01:30:59,951 --> 01:31:00,870
At the smaller ones,
you know?

1593
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:05,640
You know how fast a black blackberry we
want to go next year can literally get

1594
01:31:05,641 --> 01:31:10,350
up a tree as fast as they can run.
They go there. Just go up the tree.

1595
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,950
You're not going to out climb a
blackberry. Sure. I got a good black belt.

1596
01:31:13,951 --> 01:31:17,670
Could strangle it. No, I don't think
so. No, I don't think you could.

1597
01:31:17,671 --> 01:31:18,570
You could shoot it.

1598
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:21,900
I mean most of them are scared of people
because we usually have guns and bows

1599
01:31:21,901 --> 01:31:24,420
and arrows and stuff. Yeah, but
black bears are tricky, man.

1600
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:27,180
I've never seen one there. We've known
they don't usually attack people.

1601
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:30,540
Black pairs are much more likely to run
away from people then attack people if

1602
01:31:30,541 --> 01:31:34,540
people have died because of black bears,
brown bears in their hand or fucking,

1603
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:38,580
yeah, fire. Sorry. Grizzlies are totally
different animals and happy Hopkins.

1604
01:31:38,581 --> 01:31:41,910
One there with the bear. That's plenty
chasing him around. I remember that.

1605
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:43,590
I don't remember the name of it.
Terrified.

1606
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:46,200
The polar bears are the most
dangerous. Really? Yeah.

1607
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:50,580
Because there are 100% carnivorous.
The other ones are omnivores pro.

1608
01:31:50,581 --> 01:31:54,840
Even grizzly bears are omnivores,
but we'll say that, I'm sorry,

1609
01:31:54,841 --> 01:31:56,390
brown bears hunt a lot.
They'll,

1610
01:31:56,391 --> 01:31:59,830
they'll kill moose and they chase
moose and chase him down and kill him.

1611
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,960
They chase antelope and or um,
uh,

1612
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:06,950
a rather a Caribou and d or the
Fonz, but they a, and they'll,

1613
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:09,700
they definitely kill people. They kill
people every year. They killed people.

1614
01:32:09,701 --> 01:32:11,920
Even in America every year.
That's Brown, Brown, Brown,

1615
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:14,770
Brown bears and grizzlies
essentially the same bear.

1616
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:19,450
Black bears are smaller but still
very dangerous. But all those bears,

1617
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:22,000
they eat different things.
They'll eat like roots and berries.

1618
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:25,360
But if a polar bear sees you, they
just go, oh shit, I can eat that.

1619
01:32:25,361 --> 01:32:27,850
And then they start coming at you.
They all just want to eat.

1620
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:31,020
Anything that's moving is on the menu.
But what about wolves are, they're scared.

1621
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:34,090
They're scared of the bears will just
scary as fuck. Cause they act together.

1622
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:37,930
If it's scary thing about wolves as
they act together, they haven't been,

1623
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:40,780
there haven't been very many
attacks on human beings,

1624
01:32:40,781 --> 01:32:43,600
but it's only because we figured out
how to contain them and killed them.

1625
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,630
They used to be a lot of them.
I mean all that big bad wolf,

1626
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:49,330
all those stories that, you know, Little
Red Riding Hood and all that stuff.

1627
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,670
That all came about because
at one point in time,

1628
01:32:51,671 --> 01:32:53,620
before the wolf populations
were put under control,

1629
01:32:53,621 --> 01:32:58,030
especially back before they had really
good weapons. Wolves were a huge problem,

1630
01:32:58,031 --> 01:32:59,620
right?
During World War One,

1631
01:32:59,621 --> 01:33:04,380
the Russians and the Germans had a
cease fire because the in in the the,

1632
01:33:04,381 --> 01:33:08,200
the, the forest, they were killing
so many troops, the wolves,

1633
01:33:08,201 --> 01:33:10,570
they ran into a super pac and wolves,

1634
01:33:10,571 --> 01:33:14,020
a especially in like the really
cold climates conform superpacs.

1635
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:18,460
There's also a principle of the further
north you go, the larger the mammals are.

1636
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,910
That's why polar bears are the biggest
bears and Kodiak bear because you,

1637
01:33:21,911 --> 01:33:26,220
the further north you go, the more they
have to maintain their body mass or to a,

1638
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:30,090
in order to keep heat.
So you have enormous wolves and they,

1639
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:33,010
there were so many of them that they
were killing so many Russian and German

1640
01:33:33,011 --> 01:33:36,050
troops that they got together and they
made a cease fire. They said, hey look,

1641
01:33:36,051 --> 01:33:38,380
we're gonna just kill these walls and
then we'll go back to killing each other.

1642
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:43,060
But she's a famous incident telling
me like, I was like, Whoa, whatever.

1643
01:33:43,061 --> 01:33:46,660
Cause we got dingoes and then guys alike
didn't go as a kind of like crack heads.

1644
01:33:46,661 --> 01:33:49,300
If they kind of gang up,
I'll kind of follow you.

1645
01:33:49,301 --> 01:33:53,310
You're cutting and you know you're in
trouble. Well, but dad was jogging once.

1646
01:33:53,311 --> 01:33:57,190
He saw one Diego and he kept jogging and
he still kept joking and then he sold

1647
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:00,460
on Fraser Island is quite a phrase on it.

1648
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:03,490
Nice and straight up and
bring some anti Dingo weapons.

1649
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,400
Well he's just done jug on your arm.
Bring red bands big either.

1650
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:12,850
I like dog's 70 pounds, 60 pounds. They
kind of like, do you guys have good,

1651
01:34:12,851 --> 01:34:17,830
someone similar in cocktails.
They kill people every now and then.

1652
01:34:17,831 --> 01:34:21,220
The woman died a couple of years
ago focusing or up in Canada. Punch.

1653
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:23,890
Coyotes killed her. She was
19 years old. Young Kid.

1654
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:25,720
Apparently a talented singer too,

1655
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:29,530
but the wolves that they're starting to
shoot now in North America are really

1656
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:31,240
fucking big.
Get Jamie,

1657
01:34:31,241 --> 01:34:35,400
pull up a picture of a big wolf
that someone's killed. They, they,

1658
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:37,660
they kill these wolves and they
take pictures of him after shooting.

1659
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:40,330
They're like put, putting in a
bear, hug hugs and hold them up.

1660
01:34:40,331 --> 01:34:44,260
So you see how big their, you know, there
are 150 200 pounds. They're fucking huge.

1661
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:46,870
I could never shoot a dog.
You say that. But yeah,

1662
01:34:46,910 --> 01:34:51,380
when it goes a bloody circle in you all
love humans. But I'd shoot to kill me.

1663
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:54,200
Show you the size of that. That's
one of them. But that's, that's,

1664
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:57,670
that's a perspective shot. The wolves
in front of you. It's, it's to tell,

1665
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:01,070
show a one of the ones where a guys
picking up a wolf because there's,

1666
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:03,320
some of them were guys are holding
up these wolves and you're like,

1667
01:35:03,321 --> 01:35:07,960
that is fucking insane. It's bigger
than a person. Oh my God. Yeah.

1668
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:09,350
Look at the size of that fucking thing.

1669
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:14,720
And they have a lot of them now in
places like Idaho and Montana. They're,

1670
01:35:14,721 --> 01:35:17,960
they're starting to, uh,
to shoot them and uh,

1671
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:21,340
put hunting seasons on him
and Ma put larger, um, uh,

1672
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:25,010
tag limits on him as well because they
want more people to kill wolves. A lion,

1673
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:29,300
they're big. See, here's another
one. The of that Australia,

1674
01:35:29,301 --> 01:35:30,320
we've got the smallest,

1675
01:35:30,321 --> 01:35:34,100
we get the bloody little spider that
kills you and a snake. Well, the,

1676
01:35:34,101 --> 01:35:36,740
a lot of these are reintroduced in
North America and the thing is they were

1677
01:35:36,741 --> 01:35:38,480
almost decimated in North America.

1678
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,380
So they brought in the Canadian
wolves to repopulate. And then again,

1679
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:45,290
here's the issue. The further north
you go, the colder the weather is,

1680
01:35:45,291 --> 01:35:48,770
the larger the animals and so that you
get in these larger wolves. I mean,

1681
01:35:48,771 --> 01:35:52,370
they're the same species technically,
but it's just like,

1682
01:35:52,610 --> 01:35:53,810
like white tailed deer.

1683
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:57,110
Whitetail deer in Mexico tend to only
be here like around a hundred pounds.

1684
01:35:57,260 --> 01:36:01,160
But when you get up to Alberta,
whitetail deer get to like two 50,

1685
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:05,450
300 pounds sometimes because it's much
colder and they need to have more body

1686
01:36:05,451 --> 01:36:08,090
mass to keep their body heat
up. It's pretty, pretty amazing.

1687
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,700
Australia pretty awake, like
crooked. I was probably the worst.

1688
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:14,920
The funniest thing was Vegas yesterday.
I was,

1689
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,360
I met up with a friend of a friend
and shit. I was like, you know, you,

1690
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:21,950
your boyfriend got to come to Sydney
some time like Sydney because then every

1691
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:24,650
like, you know, if I go there, it's
just everybody wants to kill me.

1692
01:36:24,651 --> 01:36:29,120
I've heard that way. Everything is
trying to kill you. That spiders,

1693
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:32,990
Americans has been there. That's
how, you know what, here's the thing.

1694
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:37,940
And she's like, Oh man, I heard about
those drop bears. And I was like, Yay.

1695
01:36:37,950 --> 01:36:41,400
Shear is, don't give that away. You
don't know about drop bears there.

1696
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:45,440
What's the drop bear drop barriers?
Um, it's a, it's a kind of a,

1697
01:36:45,441 --> 01:36:49,130
an alternative species. A Koala
bear and they hang, you know,

1698
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:53,980
Koala bears and they're hanging out in
trees and they drop on people's heads. Um,

1699
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:58,650
they don't know why, but for some
reason the way Americans talk, they um,

1700
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:01,700
can you get where we're going
with this fucking hate Americans?

1701
01:37:01,701 --> 01:37:05,030
I fucking hate America. The
accident. There we go. It's
basically like, well, yeah,

1702
01:37:05,031 --> 01:37:08,510
that's the drawback. Gray ones is if
you pull a block on the fuck outta here.

1703
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:13,830
She does a real, yeah. No,
that's real bear with giant fans.

1704
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:18,680
Black, black drop. They only attack
Americans. Australia back Americans.

1705
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,720
Are you trying to keep
Americans out of Australia?

1706
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:24,100
We may or may not be doing that. Are
you guys fucking with us? It's a,

1707
01:37:24,650 --> 01:37:28,550
I'm not sure. Come on. Are you fucking
with him? I'm not sure if we say anything.

1708
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:30,050
I'm sure when we get back to the,

1709
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:33,860
when we get back to the visa section
at our airport, they may take our past.

1710
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:37,190
How is it possible that these Koala bear,
this shit is Photoshop.

1711
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:40,770
So this is bullshit.
This is bullshit.

1712
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:44,810
There's something about the pitch
and the smell of the American roads.

1713
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:47,570
It's the muscle thing about resumes.
I smell bullshit.

1714
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,310
You're smelling the right thing.
Okay.

1715
01:37:49,311 --> 01:37:53,490
Why are you bullshitting people
in Australia? In Australia.
It's just a thing. We,

1716
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:56,240
everyone,
every time you had made an American Koala

1717
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:59,190
bears and less homeless,
bloody useless three my life,

1718
01:37:59,191 --> 01:38:02,670
they're making little chocolate treats.
So these images with this fake teeth,

1719
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,270
it's all, it's a, it's an
Australia target tourists.

1720
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:09,910
Like this girl yesterday, it was
like, no, the terrified, you know,

1721
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:13,320
what about this drop bears? I'm like,
are you serious bits to go online?

1722
01:38:13,321 --> 01:38:14,880
You find out in two seconds.
The first,

1723
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:19,800
the first thing when you Google drop
bears is museum of hoaxes. Yeah.

1724
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:25,680
Oh, that's all we got to worry about.
Our pigs are short legs and um,

1725
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:30,100
and pretty much um,
pigs and kangaroos and they're not.

1726
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:34,590
Do you guys eat kangaroo here?
Um, you can get it. Yeah.

1727
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:36,300
I mean you can get it.
You can get it.

1728
01:38:36,301 --> 01:38:38,970
Like there's exotic neat places
where they'll say pretty common.

1729
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:43,260
There's a place that serves,
you can buy lion meat that's seen by lion.

1730
01:38:43,261 --> 01:38:45,870
I'm going to be fresh.
It's all going to be frozen.

1731
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,760
All of it's going to be frozen. But, uh,

1732
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:51,660
there's exotic meat companies like people
are into like trying weird shit like

1733
01:38:51,661 --> 01:38:56,530
zebra and stuff like that. I try
go try that zebra like I had, um,

1734
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,330
I had a lot of the, the um,
wait til could drive us,

1735
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:04,950
which is like dried sausage and built on,
it's like your jerky but no a zebra.

1736
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:10,140
They've got everything that
they do some really good stuff.

1737
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:15,380
Why not that this is different places
that you can go in Africa where you can

1738
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,250
shoot anything you want and uh,

1739
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:25,200
Louis Theroux I had a whole special
about it. It's really quite fascinating.

1740
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:27,270
Did you watch the show?
Yeah. Yeah. By the way,

1741
01:39:27,271 --> 01:39:30,170
when you had that podcast I
was geeking out. Cause I, I,

1742
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:31,950
when I hear that guy talk
I just want to hug him.

1743
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:35,880
He's just like such a charming fellow.
He's very cool. He's very interesting too.

1744
01:39:35,881 --> 01:39:38,880
I really, really enjoy talking to my mom
loves him. If you're listening to this,

1745
01:39:38,881 --> 01:39:43,380
lily, my mum, this is APP Telle loves
you. I love it. That's cool. Yeah.

1746
01:39:43,381 --> 01:39:45,300
It was interesting having her Monica,

1747
01:39:45,301 --> 01:39:48,570
somewhere along the line I realized
that he was sizing me up to figure out

1748
01:39:48,571 --> 01:39:52,260
whether or not he could do a story on me
like Louie was. Yeah, there was, well,

1749
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:54,660
I think he thinks I'm starting
a cult or something like that.

1750
01:39:54,661 --> 01:39:56,460
Or you heard you heard
it because he's like,

1751
01:39:56,461 --> 01:40:00,000
I have met all these people that tell me
I have to go on the Joe Rogan podcast.

1752
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:02,880
And he's like, they have this thing in
their eye. They look a little crazy.

1753
01:40:03,070 --> 01:40:03,450
And he's like,

1754
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:06,780
he's talking to call it like you had
a like this conversation with me.

1755
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:11,610
And I'm like, no man, no. If it's
happening, it's not, I'm not,

1756
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,670
it's not me. We had a bunch of
guys sign up to our academy.

1757
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:19,080
They're not there anymore, but they signed
up and they said, they said, um, yeah,

1758
01:40:19,081 --> 01:40:21,900
we listen to the Joe
Rogan podcast and he says,

1759
01:40:21,901 --> 01:40:25,230
we need to do Jiu Jitsu lift kettlebells
or smoke weed. So these guys would,

1760
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:28,390
they bought kettlebells.
These are it nerds like the dorkiest.

1761
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:30,800
Did you ever seen right?
They bought the kettlebells.

1762
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:32,490
I'm pretty sure they didn't
take them out of the box.

1763
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:36,450
And after training every day they go
smoke weed in their car and like it was

1764
01:40:36,451 --> 01:40:40,590
just absolutely what you
prescribed and you'll call,

1765
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:43,960
ah, I'm not prescribing shit,
I'm not running the call.

1766
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:47,880
I just wanted to state that for the record
there is no called stop looking for a

1767
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:50,220
sign up sheet on my website.
It doesn't exist.

1768
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,740
But the thing I was going to say about,
which is interesting about the internet,

1769
01:40:52,741 --> 01:40:55,660
we were talking about this on
the way here is like in my gym,

1770
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:00,730
each person or has their own kind
of little, ah, okay. So for example,

1771
01:41:00,731 --> 01:41:03,430
like most guys listen to your
short right that do martial arts,

1772
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:06,970
but they each tend to diversify.
Like one guy goes, yeah, no,

1773
01:41:06,971 --> 01:41:11,770
I'm an institute Rogan anymore into uh, a
Duncan Trussell. He's more kind of like,

1774
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:15,990
you know, my kind of like a
tempo of vibe, you know, like,

1775
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,260
and all the kids have now
chosen there their path. Yeah.

1776
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:25,540
It's a cool time to like for content
because everything's free too. Right.

1777
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:30,760
You know, it used to be that if you
wanted different stuff online you,

1778
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:34,450
well first of all was podcast
didn't exist just 10 years ago.

1779
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:35,573
You couldn't find them.

1780
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:39,370
And then second of all like
to have different radio
shows that you listen to her.

1781
01:41:39,371 --> 01:41:41,060
It's very difficult to get ahold of cop.

1782
01:41:41,061 --> 01:41:45,280
Like I have a bunch of Terence Mckenna
recordings and Alan Watts and a few

1783
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:47,440
different interesting people,

1784
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:50,920
like a few Timothy leary things and
that I've downloaded here and there from

1785
01:41:50,921 --> 01:41:53,560
various websites. But you had a
search for him. It was really hard.

1786
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:56,410
We still have a little CD of you like,

1787
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:59,350
and I remember I was saying the
first time we heard your stuff,

1788
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,880
it was my friends in high
school and this is like this is,

1789
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:05,220
this is 15 years ago or something,

1790
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:09,640
smoking cigarettes and listen to
this crazy dude on a, on a CD,

1791
01:42:09,641 --> 01:42:12,010
talking about little athletes
go to China and stuff.

1792
01:42:12,011 --> 01:42:15,640
That was probably like your oldest
stuff, right? Athletes, you know,

1793
01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:18,670
like the school teacher comes up to
him and say, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1794
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:22,470
There was a about the Olympics. Yeah,
it was a little bit about little,

1795
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,940
it wasn't about Chinese.
It was about messed it up.

1796
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:26,260
That's why you're the comedian.

1797
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:30,310
It was the most about someone going to
the Olympics and then having to go to

1798
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:33,910
high school after they win the gold medal
in the Olympics. Like math. Seriously.

1799
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:37,570
The teachers starts giving him shit
about not doing their homework. Yeah.

1800
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:40,410
But the thing is that your,
your standup,

1801
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:43,780
and probably back in the day like Bill
Hicks and stuff was kind of a dirty

1802
01:42:43,781 --> 01:42:47,270
little secret that made me sound
smarter at parties. You know?

1803
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:52,060
And nowadays everybody listens
to podcasts. It's like,
it's, it's, um, it's great,

1804
01:42:52,061 --> 01:42:53,890
which is great. Don't get me
wrong. I'm just saying as an, um,

1805
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:56,770
there's no dirty little secret anymore.
Right?

1806
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:58,270
Well that's the thing that people love.

1807
01:42:58,271 --> 01:43:02,170
They love knowing things before
it's cool. Yeah. Like, oh,

1808
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:04,660
a new forest mainstream.
It's all bullshit now.

1809
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,690
I don't even listen to Rogan anymore.
He's all bullshit.

1810
01:43:07,691 --> 01:43:10,660
That's for fucking people that are
just now getting into podcasts.

1811
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:15,010
I am all about Dunkin trust now.
That's what, that's what he's psychic.

1812
01:43:15,011 --> 01:43:18,310
Ben does psychic bands like, well, I
can't say bad. Well, you know what?

1813
01:43:18,311 --> 01:43:20,740
People will do that.
They'll do that and then they'll be like,

1814
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:24,430
they'll Ben in donkey and after a while
and then they'll go to another guy and

1815
01:43:24,431 --> 01:43:27,070
then you bought, but it's fine.
You know? I look, I do that too.

1816
01:43:27,071 --> 01:43:28,650
I get in these streaks where I,

1817
01:43:28,651 --> 01:43:32,050
I'll get in there a certain podcast and
I'll listen to only hardcore history for

1818
01:43:32,051 --> 01:43:34,420
like six months and then
I'll go with radio lab.

1819
01:43:34,421 --> 01:43:36,460
I'll just only radio lab for three months.

1820
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:39,790
It's like you get annoyed at people
too if you listen to them too much.

1821
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:43,210
Like I've heard people's like complaining
about me. Yo, you poured crows change.

1822
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:46,270
I used to love it. No training.
No. It's actually hasn't changed.

1823
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:48,070
It's exactly the same.
It just,

1824
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:51,190
you listen to someone after awhile
they become fucking annoying.

1825
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:52,330
That's why marriages

1826
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:56,120
break up. That's why you don't hang out
with the same fucking guy every day,

1827
01:43:56,121 --> 01:44:00,320
all day. You get bored with people.
It's fucking, people get annoying, man.

1828
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:03,320
Everything gets annoying if you have,
I love cheeseburgers,

1829
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:04,730
but if I had a fucking cheeseburger,

1830
01:44:04,731 --> 01:44:09,140
every dad want to shoot myself every
after a why be like Jesus Christ enough

1831
01:44:09,141 --> 01:44:11,120
with the cheeseburgers and
the quality of the day.

1832
01:44:11,150 --> 01:44:14,120
The guests has been slowly sinking.
I say this because you guys are here.

1833
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:19,040
I had Eliza slessinger on before you and
she won last comic standing and she's

1834
01:44:19,041 --> 01:44:22,040
hilarious. How dare you? Well, you know,

1835
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:26,390
I think one of the keys to the podcast
is that I put people on that I would like

1836
01:44:26,391 --> 01:44:31,340
to talk to. Genuine interest is the most
important thing to me and people say, Oh,

1837
01:44:31,341 --> 01:44:35,780
you need to have this kind of person
or that are more science people or more

1838
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:37,910
whatever. I don't, I'm not interested.

1839
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:40,010
What I'm interested in is
what I'm interested in.

1840
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:44,490
I'm not interested in diversifying for
anybody else's ideas that way. The, the,

1841
01:44:44,770 --> 01:44:45,080
the,

1842
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:49,010
the thing that I talk about is always
something that I'm genuinely fascinated

1843
01:44:49,011 --> 01:44:50,660
with and that's all I'm concerned with.

1844
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:54,830
And you've been promoting a lot of people
doing podcasts as in like telling them

1845
01:44:54,831 --> 01:44:58,120
to do their own podcast. Sure. Yeah, I
did that with Eliza earlier. I think she,

1846
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,350
I think there's plenty of room,
first of all,

1847
01:45:00,351 --> 01:45:02,450
there's seven fucking
billion people on the planet,

1848
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,250
300 million people in this country,

1849
01:45:04,251 --> 01:45:07,520
and the idea that you should only want
people to listen to your podcast is

1850
01:45:07,790 --> 01:45:12,290
foolish. And for what I stated before,
you're going to get bored of me. You know?

1851
01:45:12,291 --> 01:45:16,670
It's like there should be a lot of the
shit you tune into is plenty of room for

1852
01:45:16,671 --> 01:45:21,230
everybody and podcast. Also. I think
the better you get at something,

1853
01:45:21,231 --> 01:45:25,370
the more you do it. And when I say the
podcast is the same as it's always been,

1854
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:29,120
I don't necessarily know because I think
I've probably changed as a human being.

1855
01:45:29,121 --> 01:45:33,110
I'm evolving, at least I try to constantly
work on myself, so I would hope to,

1856
01:45:33,111 --> 01:45:34,640
the podcast gets better,

1857
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:39,670
but along the way you kind
of realize that there's,

1858
01:45:39,711 --> 01:45:43,190
there's plenty for everybody, but I'm
like that with everything man. I'm like,

1859
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,570
I promote all my friends when
it comes to standup comedy,

1860
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:48,050
when it comes to everything.

1861
01:45:48,051 --> 01:45:52,940
I think that the idea of only promoting
yourself or only pushing yourself,

1862
01:45:52,941 --> 01:45:56,060
that's a famine mentality and I think
that mentality is a very dangerous

1863
01:45:56,061 --> 01:46:00,330
mentality. It's foolhardy. It's,
it's, it's, it's stupid and it, it,

1864
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:02,840
it promotes this sort of
desperate sort of thinking,

1865
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:07,340
which I think goes against the
very nature of a progress itself.

1866
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:10,400
I think it's all about helping people out.

1867
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:14,120
It's all about promoting ideas
that you find beneficial,

1868
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:18,710
promoting people that you enjoy
their work or their, their ideas.

1869
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:20,780
And I think that the more you do that,

1870
01:46:20,781 --> 01:46:23,090
the better it is for you and
the better it is for everybody.

1871
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,400
Can I see with regard to,
um,

1872
01:46:26,030 --> 01:46:31,010
like he's and my friend is starting a
podcast, right? What advice? Well, he,

1873
01:46:31,011 --> 01:46:34,550
he, he was writing a book originally
that was the original thing,

1874
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:40,040
but running is not really his
thing. All mine really. Um,

1875
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:44,120
do you think of podcasts is a good place
to start? Fuck yeah. Stuff like that.

1876
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:46,820
Yeah, absolutely. Just do
it. It's not hard. I mean,

1877
01:46:46,821 --> 01:46:48,890
you don't need a set up
like this where it's also a,

1878
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,530
with hammers and all that shit.
All you need is an MP. Yeah.

1879
01:46:51,531 --> 01:46:55,950
You don't need a predator, a lava lamp
or a salt rock. All you need is a,

1880
01:46:55,951 --> 01:46:57,840
an MP three recorder and microphones.

1881
01:46:57,841 --> 01:47:01,320
It's super easy to do for a couple
hundred bucks. You set it up,

1882
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:02,490
you put it on a table,

1883
01:47:02,491 --> 01:47:05,910
you sit around with some chairs
and you talk and you get better.

1884
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:07,440
You do it at first and you know,

1885
01:47:07,441 --> 01:47:11,580
you listen to them and you listen
to a input online. That's a big one.

1886
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:12,720
Listened to what people say,
Oh,

1887
01:47:12,721 --> 01:47:14,880
you're talking over people too
much or you interrupt too much,

1888
01:47:14,881 --> 01:47:16,800
and sometimes people do
things along those lines.

1889
01:47:16,801 --> 01:47:19,440
They don't even realize they're
doing it and you have to tell him,

1890
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:23,100
or some people, they just,
they're not listening,

1891
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:26,130
they're just waiting for their turn to
talk. There's a lot of that going on too.

1892
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:27,150
It's funny when you're saying that,

1893
01:47:27,151 --> 01:47:31,160
I'm conscious of myself doing that in
terms of other like, okay, hold on. Yeah,

1894
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:34,080
yeah, yeah. Okay. Just hold back. Well,

1895
01:47:34,081 --> 01:47:37,830
there's an art to conversation and that's
one of the things you find out about

1896
01:47:37,831 --> 01:47:41,340
doing podcasts. You find out
about the art of conversation,

1897
01:47:41,350 --> 01:47:45,030
about the find out about the art
of when to talk, when not to talk,

1898
01:47:45,031 --> 01:47:48,600
listening actually interacting with people
instead of just trying to say you're

1899
01:47:48,601 --> 01:47:52,800
things like there's some people that are
frustrating to do podcasts with because

1900
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:56,940
all they're trying to do is impress upon
you how much they know and spout out

1901
01:47:56,941 --> 01:47:59,520
facts and quote people and you're like,
Jesus fucking Christ.

1902
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:02,760
Did you even listen to what I said?
You just waited until I was done.

1903
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:06,210
And then you spit out a bunch of quotes
and shit that are not even related.

1904
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:09,420
You know, they're just, they have
this idea that they want to get out.

1905
01:48:09,421 --> 01:48:13,740
And a lot of it is like trying to sound
cool. It's a lot of ego. It's a lot.

1906
01:48:13,741 --> 01:48:16,020
There's a lot involved that you,

1907
01:48:16,050 --> 01:48:19,230
you find these parallels and
just a normal conversation.

1908
01:48:19,770 --> 01:48:22,680
I'm shocked sometimes when
I talk to people about,

1909
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:26,340
at how bad people are at not
Inter, uh, at interrupting people,

1910
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:28,170
not listening to people
when they're talking.

1911
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:32,340
So podcasting just makes you
better at the art of conversation.

1912
01:48:32,341 --> 01:48:33,960
And the better you get at it,

1913
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:38,880
the less awkward a podcast is to listen
to, you know, so you just do it, man.

1914
01:48:38,881 --> 01:48:43,800
Just do it. Start it. You'll get good at
it. So that's the plan. And then hard man,

1915
01:48:43,801 --> 01:48:46,770
you guys could do it. You're hanging
here easy. It's, it's easy. You guys are,

1916
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:50,040
you know, you're smart, you're
articulate, you're easy to talk to.

1917
01:48:50,041 --> 01:48:52,770
You're down to earth. It's
perfect for a podcast. Set it up.

1918
01:48:53,210 --> 01:48:57,180
So it does put a fucking MP, three
recorder, a couple of microphones, Bam.

1919
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:59,800
And you're off to the races.
We did one, we did one on the,

1920
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:03,840
on else that growing downside
and we recorded at 20 times
before he released it.

1921
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:07,200
Why? Because look, we'll
sit in there with my,

1922
01:49:07,201 --> 01:49:11,070
with my friend who's a psychologist
and Dylan and I were there and um,

1923
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:16,920
we recorded about 20 before
that and it was just like, man,

1924
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:20,220
it just listen to yourself.
And also on top of that,

1925
01:49:20,221 --> 01:49:24,030
like he w he was very concerned
how people would see him as,

1926
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:27,660
as a professional because he's
being open and speaking his mind.

1927
01:49:27,661 --> 01:49:31,170
He's a really funny guy. Um, Jonathan,
the [inaudible] Jonathan back,

1928
01:49:31,171 --> 01:49:33,300
he's really funny guy,
but he was a bit considered,

1929
01:49:33,301 --> 01:49:37,530
it took us about 20 times for him to
stop playing a character. You know,

1930
01:49:37,531 --> 01:49:39,450
like the hubcaps slashed Hannibal Lecter.

1931
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,540
So you got like some of a trigger
to me it looks like Vince Vaughn.

1932
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:46,460
So he's having a hard time
relaxing and being himself. Yeah,

1933
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:49,990
well that happens.
That happens and that'll,

1934
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:53,380
that'll be taken care of in time.
You just gotta do it.

1935
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:55,870
Just do it after a while.
You get used to it. I mean,

1936
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:58,480
I have friends that sucked at podcasting
in the beginning and now they're

1937
01:49:58,481 --> 01:50:00,370
awesome at it and they just,
it just takes time.

1938
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:03,310
You figure out how to do it right.
You figure some people, by the way,

1939
01:50:03,311 --> 01:50:04,690
they fucking never get better.

1940
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:09,960
They'll podcast for hundreds of episodes
and they still say stupid shit and jump

1941
01:50:10,601 --> 01:50:13,930
in the wrong time and fuck up
the flow of the conversation.

1942
01:50:13,931 --> 01:50:18,100
And make it all about them. It's,
it's, you're going to have that too.

1943
01:50:18,101 --> 01:50:20,890
You're going to have guests on that are
disasters that you never going to have

1944
01:50:20,891 --> 01:50:25,330
on again. And you recognize
that like while you're
talking to them like, oh fuck,

1945
01:50:25,331 --> 01:50:28,120
I can never have this guy. And
again, some people just not design,

1946
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:31,710
some people are just not
fucking interesting. You don't
even know why. Like what,

1947
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:34,600
what is it about one person's
personality that makes them fascinating?

1948
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:39,340
I don't know. Is it honesty? Is it their,
their curiosity? Is it, what is it,

1949
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:41,980
you know, I don't know what
he's got a different thing.

1950
01:50:42,190 --> 01:50:46,360
Sometimes I would talking before about
like some people were talking about what

1951
01:50:46,630 --> 01:50:49,200
and meanwhile I've just talked over him
for the whole podcast supportive here.

1952
01:50:49,210 --> 01:50:52,600
I want to, no, no you did. No, that's
cool. Well, you guys are all interacting.

1953
01:50:52,601 --> 01:50:54,790
It's no, it's cool.
But the thing was like,

1954
01:50:54,791 --> 01:50:57,850
sometimes it's kind of feels like
people aren't ready to hear some stuff,

1955
01:50:57,851 --> 01:51:00,210
you know, like in terms of,
um, holding back, you know,

1956
01:51:00,211 --> 01:51:02,410
and I wonder if that comes across
as boring when you're trying to,

1957
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:05,530
do you know what I mean?
Like we talked about some of this stuff.

1958
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:09,880
Some of your stories is like maybe not
for, I dunno, you know what I mean?

1959
01:51:09,881 --> 01:51:14,740
Like it might come across as not being
willing to share, you know what I mean?

1960
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:17,950
Oh, I don't think so. You
can't overthink things either.

1961
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:21,220
You got to just put it out and
then listen to the feedback,

1962
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:22,540
listen to it yourself.

1963
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:26,770
But sometimes it's hard to see yourself
the way other people see you, you know,

1964
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,650
you, you have to, and then it's also,
you're gonna, it's gonna be hard,

1965
01:51:29,651 --> 01:51:33,070
listened to the feedback because punching
people are going to writeZ , Z, Z, Z,

1966
01:51:33,071 --> 01:51:36,940
Xie fucking boring. Kill yourself. You
mean it's going to be a lot of that.

1967
01:51:37,270 --> 01:51:39,040
You're going to have to deal with that.
Parents,

1968
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:42,130
your own parents know you're going to
have to deal with that. But listen,

1969
01:51:42,131 --> 01:51:44,890
I would think that just your
stories about Thailand, I mean,

1970
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:49,510
just the story that you were telling me
about those dealing with those bodies,

1971
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:51,340
just that alone,
like holy shit,

1972
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,530
he's telling me, you were telling me
the dice. Tell me about the aiding.

1973
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:57,490
Remember we were told
about any of this stuff.

1974
01:51:58,070 --> 01:52:01,810
I'm at the store has a lot of
them, you know, funny to me,

1975
01:52:01,811 --> 01:52:05,740
like have a Jewish background.
For example, I never ate pork.

1976
01:52:05,930 --> 01:52:08,440
It was just what we did it.
And that's a part of my religion.

1977
01:52:08,441 --> 01:52:12,480
But like now it can't
stop here. Um, you know,

1978
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:14,050
we'll transporting bodies off.

1979
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:18,370
I'm on one boat and would sit in the
middle making sure nobody's jumped off the

1980
01:52:18,371 --> 01:52:22,450
side or fell off the side and they'd
would transport food back onto the island

1981
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:26,720
without cleaving anything.
Food Day there'd be flies.

1982
01:52:26,721 --> 01:52:30,700
And it was pretty bad. Holy Shit.
I was starving. I was like, Nah,

1983
01:52:30,701 --> 01:52:33,670
we get an 80 wheel vomiting a lot just
from the smells and stuff. I was like,

1984
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:38,170
you know, let's, um, you know, I need to,
I need some food, man. I've got eight now.

1985
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,380
So I went over there, I'm
like, what is this packet?

1986
01:52:40,570 --> 01:52:43,690
There's just like flies everywhere. Might
not fuck that. I'm not, not even that.

1987
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:46,310
And then I said, no, I've got
to eat something. So I had,

1988
01:52:46,311 --> 01:52:51,170
it's just a little packet and an $80
like this stuff is freaking awesome.

1989
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:56,000
So I sit to the type person, I'm like,
like near right, like what is this?

1990
01:52:56,420 --> 01:53:00,910
And like our Ni, Ni Mu something he
moved or like it must be a cow, right?

1991
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:02,380
Some 80 of his stuff.
And a man,

1992
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:06,860
I got so addicted to it that I got them
to write it down in English and Thai for

1993
01:53:06,861 --> 01:53:09,800
me. And then when I went to back
to the main land and for many,

1994
01:53:09,801 --> 01:53:13,070
many trips after I kept ordering
the same dish, I loved it.

1995
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:16,130
And my friend turns around and he goes,
[inaudible] when to eat pork? I'm like,

1996
01:53:16,131 --> 01:53:20,920
it's not pork, it's Mu, it's
Catholic. Moo Cow. He's ties,

1997
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:23,850
probably looked to me like, oh, this
white guy. And I was like, Oh, you know,

1998
01:53:23,851 --> 01:53:27,050
they're just making their sound. An animal
that Lou actually translate to pork.

1999
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,240
So, I mean, eating pork
for like 10 years, it,

2000
01:53:29,241 --> 01:53:33,770
even though it was pork and it was just
so much miscommunication and translation

2001
01:53:33,771 --> 01:53:35,450
problems,
there's lots of,

2002
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:38,330
so you still thought that you were
adhering to your religious practice?

2003
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:41,870
Um, look, I probably would have
ended anyway and like, you know,

2004
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:46,310
the prongs and stuff, but um, it was
so good, man. I've never given it up.

2005
01:53:46,580 --> 01:53:47,110
I love it.

2006
01:53:47,110 --> 01:53:51,220
Yeah. Prawns are against
the shell fish. Right?

2007
01:53:51,221 --> 01:53:54,850
And that's supposed to eat shellfish.
Jews love the unlimited shrimp. A buffet.

2008
01:53:54,851 --> 01:53:59,080
So yeah, pretty much. It's true. That's
hilarious. It shrimp gets a pass,

2009
01:53:59,081 --> 01:54:03,130
but it's just a cloven hoof.
You ever had wild pork?

2010
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:08,740
We hunted but never ate. You can't eat
it in Australia. Why not? It's the worms.

2011
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:11,890
They're pretty gross.
So they tend the babies,

2012
01:54:11,891 --> 01:54:15,500
they capture the babies and they deworm
them and send them to Germany because

2013
01:54:15,501 --> 01:54:16,780
they love the boys.
You know,

2014
01:54:16,781 --> 01:54:20,650
I didn't know balls were pigs for the
first one or watch Abelick's asterix and

2015
01:54:20,651 --> 01:54:23,290
Obelix. I was like, boars, I
didn't have bars. What pigs?

2016
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:25,810
They'll like this mythical
creature. Well, it's,

2017
01:54:25,930 --> 01:54:30,110
apparently it's all the same
species. I had a guy, uh,

2018
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:33,640
is the guy that I hunt with that's been
on the podcast is named Steve Rinella

2019
01:54:34,190 --> 01:54:37,540
book. Yeah. Great Book.
But he said it's all,

2020
01:54:37,541 --> 01:54:42,040
they're all from the genus Seuss
Grapha they're all the same thing.

2021
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:46,540
Is that a wild pig can breed with a,
a domestic pig that sort of,

2022
01:54:46,541 --> 01:54:49,510
they're all pigs. There's a thing
about pigs that happens too.

2023
01:54:49,511 --> 01:54:52,330
When you take a domestic pig
and they get loose in the wild.

2024
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:55,720
Within three weeks their
body starts to change.

2025
01:54:55,810 --> 01:54:58,270
They metamorphosize their,
their,

2026
01:54:58,271 --> 01:55:02,290
their hair gets longer and thicker
and bushier their tusks grow.

2027
01:55:02,810 --> 01:55:03,910
Their nose grows.

2028
01:55:03,911 --> 01:55:08,310
Really fascinating stuff from him
telling me that's what I said, Mike,

2029
01:55:08,330 --> 01:55:09,200
you sound smarter.

2030
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:14,260
Potties [inaudible] I'm like fuck up
and get away with anything anymore.

2031
01:55:16,090 --> 01:55:17,680
They morph.
It's really fascinating.

2032
01:55:17,681 --> 01:55:20,020
They'd look physically different
than the pigs that you have.

2033
01:55:20,021 --> 01:55:24,700
Like in domestic stables. They changed
their appearance. Their nose grows longer,

2034
01:55:24,701 --> 01:55:28,450
but it's really weird. They get tusks.
Yeah. And that's a domestic pig.

2035
01:55:28,570 --> 01:55:32,680
They start to look like the Lord as
well. Huge, huge problem. Huge problem.

2036
01:55:32,681 --> 01:55:35,870
We can hug is, yeah, there's no
tag limits on them in California.

2037
01:55:35,871 --> 01:55:38,620
And you could shoot as many as you want,
man. You could go shoot pigs all day.

2038
01:55:38,621 --> 01:55:42,490
So he'll say, I can't do it man. But
he likes he can't shoot pigs. No,

2039
01:55:42,491 --> 01:55:44,190
I just got in in Australia.

2040
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:49,140
Don't should pigs. You Dog. Um Oh. And
then you stab him. I can't do that.

2041
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:53,280
But we've got,
depends where you are in New South Wales,

2042
01:55:53,281 --> 01:55:56,640
but you can kill pigs and Kangaroos
if they're destroying the land.

2043
01:55:57,070 --> 01:56:00,270
But you're going to stand like skippy
skippy back in the day. The Bush,

2044
01:56:00,271 --> 01:56:02,230
kangaroo skippy the Bush kangaroos.
Like he's,

2045
01:56:02,490 --> 01:56:07,350
he was kinda like Mister Ed was like
alien, Mister Red. He didn't talk,

2046
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:11,200
but he was kind of that character. Like,
you know, he's a good guy. Wrestling.

2047
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:15,580
He was pretty much like captain America
about as interesting. Like he's the, like,

2048
01:56:15,590 --> 01:56:18,060
he was basically like a hero
that didn't really do anything.

2049
01:56:18,061 --> 01:56:22,470
Say anything too interesting. Or You
like Captain America? I find a doll,

2050
01:56:22,471 --> 01:56:26,880
but I know it's so skewed.
Anyway. So skippy skippy,

2051
01:56:26,881 --> 01:56:30,150
that's given me, so it's
like lassie. It'd be,

2052
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:34,500
oh man,
can I tell you something?

2053
01:56:34,501 --> 01:56:36,210
You haven't seen
something very Australian.

2054
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:40,230
So when we go hunting and the farmers
want to kill the Kangaroos really hard for

2055
01:56:40,231 --> 01:56:44,340
us cause it's like, cause it's kids grew
up with skippy. We grew up with skippy.

2056
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:46,830
There's some kangaroos that are bigger,
right?

2057
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:50,300
There's a red ones and the gray
ones, the red ones are scary. Yeah.

2058
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:55,140
How big they get Taronga Zoo in
Sydney. Which by the way, if you ever,

2059
01:56:55,290 --> 01:56:56,870
did you go to yes.
Yes.

2060
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:02,200
Why would see Kangaroos in the wild?
This big massive.

2061
01:57:02,201 --> 01:57:06,870
They're the ones we see a small, if you
hit one like a kangaroo people, oh Geez.

2062
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:09,180
You know, people would talk
about Kangaroos like God,

2063
01:57:09,181 --> 01:57:11,460
he's so cute and this and that.
And they are cute.

2064
01:57:12,030 --> 01:57:15,230
They tasted really good as
well. But you know, like they,

2065
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:19,260
they are the roads everywhere. And you
know, why don't kill wasn't even longer.

2066
01:57:19,261 --> 01:57:22,600
It was like two, three months ago,
you're reading the newspaper. Um,

2067
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:27,760
kangaroo went cause they jumped
in front of you. Like, Dr not as,

2068
01:57:27,810 --> 01:57:31,350
you know, they jump a lot higher but,
and they look at the headlights like, oh,

2069
01:57:31,351 --> 01:57:36,170
what's this? And then boom, he
hit them. But what happens is, um,

2070
01:57:36,830 --> 01:57:39,870
they, it went through, because the
way they're built like, you know,

2071
01:57:39,871 --> 01:57:41,700
did like he'd hits it rolls over the car.

2072
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:46,020
Where's this kangaroo with through the
windshield at the very bottom front to

2073
01:57:46,021 --> 01:57:50,250
back and killed the kid in the back.
Oh God. So like, you know, we, we,

2074
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:54,180
you see them everywhere
on the road. Wombats and
Kangaroos out about a year ago.

2075
01:57:54,181 --> 01:57:56,550
One try to jump through the
window while we were driving.

2076
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:58,560
We don't personally hunt Kangaroos,

2077
01:57:58,561 --> 01:58:03,330
but it's that you can do it in a certain
area. There's just too many of them.

2078
01:58:03,331 --> 01:58:05,400
It gets board. The one thing I
was going to say, I don't know,

2079
01:58:05,401 --> 01:58:07,830
Americans probably haven't
seen this and it's theirs.

2080
01:58:07,940 --> 01:58:10,470
There was a bit of a legal
thing going on in Australia,

2081
01:58:10,471 --> 01:58:14,040
but it just reminds me of skippy.
There's a show called home and away.

2082
01:58:14,041 --> 01:58:17,220
You've seen him in a way it was very
popular in England. I've heard of it.

2083
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:19,590
I've never seen anybody get nine
or to an Irish thing anyway.

2084
01:58:19,890 --> 01:58:24,700
There's this very wholesome character
called Alpha. Have you seen this? You can,

2085
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:28,080
you can swear on your podcast. Okay.
It's a serious load of swearing off.

2086
01:58:28,081 --> 01:58:30,540
I can do this. True, but
it's a second nature.

2087
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:35,670
But if we can get 'em taming the load
up, alf, Ms Not Alpha, like the alien.

2088
01:58:38,270 --> 01:58:39,660
This is Alpha is like a,
uh,

2089
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:44,170
like a wholesome sorta fatherly character
on a small town show that everyone

2090
01:58:44,171 --> 01:58:47,140
likes. Right? And, and what kind of
animal is he? He's not an animal,

2091
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:48,670
but he is in this,
we're going to show you.

2092
01:58:48,671 --> 01:58:52,890
So there was this whole
thing in Australia. What
happened? Was He, um, Jamie,

2093
01:58:53,010 --> 01:58:56,890
the name of it so he can go and
look up alf Mr Doodle Burger.

2094
01:58:57,460 --> 01:59:02,150
So basically what happened was that
guide took all existing home in a waste

2095
01:59:02,151 --> 01:59:06,550
stuff and he dubbed over it and made
Alpha into this character who's basically

2096
01:59:06,551 --> 01:59:10,950
like, I'm a serial killer slash murderer
rapist that loves like Colombian,

2097
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:13,990
like a little Colombian lawyers.
And now it's been quoted all over,

2098
01:59:13,991 --> 01:59:18,820
but it ended up on the news because
they tried to sue the guy. Yeah, that's,

2099
01:59:18,821 --> 01:59:22,240
that's kind of a douchey thing to do,
but it is hilarious.

2100
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:26,020
And we have to show you because the
Americans didn't know what we're talking

2101
01:59:26,021 --> 01:59:30,460
about. You know, we didn't have
Hollywood. Okay. This is one of them.

2102
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:36,610
That's how, what's the
music? Oh, is this sound

2103
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:44,020
okay? Just a video. Well,
Americans, we don't,

2104
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:46,270
we don't really have too many
of those videos available.

2105
01:59:46,271 --> 01:59:48,870
Probably try and look up Alf.

2106
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:52,900
And it's really important you have to
see it because it's a very Australian

2107
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:57,930
Alpha awards awards ceremony and it
caused a lot of problems in Australia

2108
01:59:57,940 --> 02:00:01,300
controversy and basically your average
Australian quotes it all the time.

2109
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:05,740
But Americans have no idea. And they quote
this video, this video. So ridiculous.

2110
02:00:05,741 --> 02:00:08,690
So ridiculous. Wow. I, I'm,

2111
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:11,260
I'm trying to judge whether you've
got the patients for it right now.

2112
02:00:11,261 --> 02:00:15,190
I'm not sure. But you do have to see it.
It's, it's, uh, now look up, look up.

2113
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:17,350
So you can never kill a kangaroo.
Basically.

2114
02:00:17,351 --> 02:00:21,700
You'd never can because the guys would
go with do and they eat it and stuff like

2115
02:00:21,701 --> 02:00:24,980
that. Can we put the
vibe? Oh wait, is this it?

2116
02:00:26,530 --> 02:00:27,363
I'll tell you though,

2117
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:35,180
in the real thing.
Which instead of the fake thing,

2118
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:43,600
no, I don't think this is it.
Okay. I'll Twitter it to you guys.

2119
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:48,490
Check it out because it's outrageous.
So, um, you, you couldn't shoot,

2120
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:51,010
you couldn't do the pig hunting
thing because of the way they do it.

2121
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:54,120
Where they sick dogs. I'm an insta
habit dogs and they stab at it.

2122
02:00:54,630 --> 02:00:56,080
That's a real common way to do it.

2123
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:59,410
The country boys are a bit desensitized
to it and then a real nice dude,

2124
02:00:59,411 --> 02:01:04,210
you know as well. They're nice guys. But
um, I don't feel like that's thing I,

2125
02:01:04,211 --> 02:01:05,770
yeah,
that's a weird way to do it.

2126
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:08,620
Holding it down with a dog and then
stabbing in the neck. You know,

2127
02:01:08,630 --> 02:01:11,810
you can shoot dangerous there. You
sure is. But why don't they shoot him?

2128
02:01:12,590 --> 02:01:15,760
You can't say like with
the terrain it's quite,

2129
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:18,400
it's quite hard to follow the dogs.
So then one of their dogs,

2130
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:20,320
it's different types of
why they using two dogs.

2131
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:24,280
So they normally would sniff them out
and he'd get the running with the dog.

2132
02:01:24,281 --> 02:01:25,960
You don't want to use the garden case.
He shut the door.

2133
02:01:25,970 --> 02:01:30,250
So is it just such a dense terrain
that you can't find them any other way?

2134
02:01:31,210 --> 02:01:35,740
Generally? I mean, look, it's,
it's, I was against it and
then I, I went to the farms,

2135
02:01:35,741 --> 02:01:38,530
I was hanging out with the guys
and they, you know, like anything,

2136
02:01:38,531 --> 02:01:40,010
they've got their own logic and you

2137
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,850
know, and, and it makes
sense the own rationale.

2138
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:46,940
The rationale is look at costs us a
hundred grand last year and you know,

2139
02:01:46,941 --> 02:01:47,990
it's basically like,
look,

2140
02:01:47,991 --> 02:01:52,250
we're growing food for people and they're
destroying it so therefore we kill

2141
02:01:52,251 --> 02:01:52,971
them.
Well,

2142
02:01:52,971 --> 02:01:56,300
they're very different than any other
animal and they're also very smart and

2143
02:01:56,301 --> 02:02:00,050
they breed all year round to help many
litters of many pigs all year round.

2144
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:04,520
It's just a, they have a huge problem
with it. In America, especially in Texas.

2145
02:02:04,820 --> 02:02:07,400
Texas is so bad that they've allowed
them to start shooting them out of

2146
02:02:07,401 --> 02:02:11,810
helicopters when machines.
Have you seen that as something fucked up?

2147
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:15,100
Pull up a pig man and Ted Nugent.
Uh,

2148
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:19,100
it's a a pork lips now. Fuck though. Yeah.

2149
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:23,120
They sit on a fucking helicopter
and they fly over these. Well,

2150
02:02:23,121 --> 02:02:25,640
these places are literally
infested with pigs.

2151
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:30,790
They have so many pigs in these farms and
they destroy millions of dollars worth

2152
02:02:31,221 --> 02:02:36,170
of crops every year.
There's a least 5 million pigs in Texas.

2153
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:37,880
You've also got that.

2154
02:02:37,881 --> 02:02:41,390
I'm show where those hot chicks and the
fake boobs running around catching pigs.

2155
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:44,240
One point $5 billion in damage per year.

2156
02:02:45,710 --> 02:02:49,820
I'll put 5 billion. Yeah, 1.5
billion. I mean, that's incredible.

2157
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:52,830
See, that's the thing. Americans
get these machine guns.

2158
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:56,180
We've got bolt actions and see that guy?
That's pig man.

2159
02:02:56,210 --> 02:03:01,160
Pig Man has a show where he just shoots
pigs all year round. That's Ted Nugent.

2160
02:03:01,161 --> 02:03:05,690
He's an American patriot.
Yeah. Can I ask you,

2161
02:03:05,691 --> 02:03:08,390
do you think someone can do
this and be well balanced,

2162
02:03:09,140 --> 02:03:12,530
like as a person to do what? No, I'm
not talking about like just hunting.

2163
02:03:12,531 --> 02:03:16,820
I mean as in like
hardcore animal slaughter.

2164
02:03:17,650 --> 02:03:22,040
Um, well, you know, it depends on
what you're doing it for. I mean,

2165
02:03:22,070 --> 02:03:24,610
what these people are
doing with this, uh, uh,

2166
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:27,320
pork lips now video where they're
shooting them out of helicopters.

2167
02:03:27,710 --> 02:03:32,710
They actually have to eradicate
these pigs from these farms.

2168
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:37,640
They are growing in population
at a staggering rate and
they can't control them.

2169
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:41,960
They, they have no other options
other than hiring a hunter.

2170
02:03:41,961 --> 02:03:46,410
So they have companies that they
hire to have people come in and uh,

2171
02:03:46,411 --> 02:03:47,660
and shoot these pigs.

2172
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:51,530
They bring people on and they
give the meat to families.

2173
02:03:52,780 --> 02:03:55,970
No, no, no, no, no. The hunters for the
hungry. Look, they're just delicious.

2174
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:57,200
The meat is fantastic.

2175
02:03:57,350 --> 02:04:01,360
I shot a wild pig a few months
back and I made a ham recently. I,

2176
02:04:01,361 --> 02:04:04,910
I Brian this ham for six days
and it smoked it for a day.

2177
02:04:05,090 --> 02:04:08,180
It's delicious. I mean, it was so good.

2178
02:04:08,540 --> 02:04:09,770
I'm going to do it again
in a couple of weeks.

2179
02:04:09,771 --> 02:04:13,910
I have another ham and a
couple of shoulders. You guys
do delicious. We, we, we,

2180
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:17,920
we do, we do barbecue.
Well, but we, you guys are,

2181
02:04:17,930 --> 02:04:22,520
I went to Kansas and Kansas
Barbecue is legit. Kansas City.

2182
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:27,260
Yeah. There, what's the one
they got that popular like, um,

2183
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:30,290
or don't know the name of it.
There's a bunch of really good the city,

2184
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:35,240
but I've never heard of, you guys
have got a deep culture of food here.

2185
02:04:35,241 --> 02:04:38,200
I, it's, it's uh, we just,
I was, he was a bit simple

2186
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:40,640
at that steak on the barbecue acts.
This is no joke to,

2187
02:04:40,650 --> 02:04:43,830
you want to get some barbeque
pig and taxes. This pork man,

2188
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:47,850
this pig man guy pork man pig man
has a show now called boss Hog.

2189
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,710
He just likes and it's all about his,
uh,

2190
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:52,800
he has a barbecue place
and he shoots the pigs,

2191
02:04:52,801 --> 02:04:55,890
then brings him to the barbecue place
and they serve these wild pigs that they

2192
02:04:55,891 --> 02:05:00,780
barbecue. Sounds awesome. So
good. It's so healthy for you too.

2193
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:05,430
Yeah. They're much healthier
animals. They're wild pigs.

2194
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:09,390
This is a dark meat. And they had
this campaign in America called pork,

2195
02:05:09,391 --> 02:05:12,450
the other white meat. And they
would show like pork is white meat.

2196
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:16,570
That's unhealthy pork like right. If
the pork is white, it's like anemic.

2197
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:21,420
It's like veal. Pork, like
wild pork is dark. It's like a,

2198
02:05:21,421 --> 02:05:25,110
a deeper red or color. Have you had
it? I haven't had it. It's really good.

2199
02:05:26,210 --> 02:05:29,310
I have to make sure you cook it all the
way through because the trick and osis

2200
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:33,540
cause I'm tricking gnosis comes from
animals eating other animals that have

2201
02:05:33,541 --> 02:05:34,200
trick analysis.

2202
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:38,940
So these animals could possibly get it
from like a rats or rabbits or you know,

2203
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:43,380
anything else they eat.
They eat a lot of big deer babies.

2204
02:05:43,381 --> 02:05:48,381
They ground eggs like at ground laying
birds eight 88 we've caught when eating

2205
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:52,460
each other. Oh yeah, they'll eat
anything. Their animals, pigs are,

2206
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:56,910
they're smarter shit too. They see common.
They see you, they hear you, they smell,

2207
02:05:56,911 --> 02:06:00,030
you know, they fucking bolt. We so
are we. So on one of the farmers,

2208
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:05,360
there was a whole family and he went to
shoot at them and the two adult pigs ran

2209
02:06:05,641 --> 02:06:08,460
one direction and the kids
ran in the lineup and escaped.

2210
02:06:08,790 --> 02:06:12,300
And obviously that didn't talk to each
other and planet, but it was brilliant.

2211
02:06:12,870 --> 02:06:16,840
That's funny. Yeah. It looked like it
looked almost plan while they are there,

2212
02:06:16,850 --> 02:06:19,830
smartest dogs, they're
smart, you know, their trick.

2213
02:06:19,831 --> 02:06:24,040
Tricky animals and delicious
and delicious Australians.

2214
02:06:24,060 --> 02:06:26,310
We kill them and then we
shipped them off to jail.

2215
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:29,230
I need people are smart enough to eight.
The ties it Paul,

2216
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:32,520
I didn't know about that it worm thing
that you guys can Xeloda webs of the

2217
02:06:32,521 --> 02:06:36,480
Kangaroos as well. Six as well.
Categories. Cheap meat for us. You know,

2218
02:06:36,481 --> 02:06:38,530
like what does it taste like?
It's very gay,

2219
02:06:38,531 --> 02:06:42,380
but you gotta know how to cook
up properly. Yeah, it's um,

2220
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:47,700
it's not the nicest meat,
but it's 99% fat free.

2221
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:52,130
Oh, I'm sure. It's probably very
lean. Oh, the strong lifters,

2222
02:06:52,170 --> 02:06:56,070
it's promoted to them as
really kangaroo meat like that.

2223
02:06:56,430 --> 02:06:59,670
I worry because they basically, they
kill it and then refrigerate it. They,

2224
02:06:59,671 --> 02:07:02,700
they ha let's not, um, fresh. It's, well,

2225
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:07,080
they killed it and they put it in the
thing, but I, it's not like bread,

2226
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:09,180
you know what I mean? It's
like, you know, it's some fun.

2227
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:12,720
It's some hunter on a farm killing
Chucky and I didn't really know what the

2228
02:07:12,721 --> 02:07:14,770
process is of it's not bread.
What do you mean?

2229
02:07:14,970 --> 02:07:18,410
You mean like as in there's no fobs with
kangaroos where they kill, you know,

2230
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:21,360
give it health checks and then
kill it and then produce it.

2231
02:07:21,361 --> 02:07:24,300
I'm not saying that's better or
worse. I just mean as in, you know,

2232
02:07:24,301 --> 02:07:27,990
it shows up in your Woolworth's, what
do you guys have? I'm not walnuts.

2233
02:07:27,991 --> 02:07:31,310
You guys have like Metro or,
uh,

2234
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:36,010
but um,
I kind of think

2235
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:38,260
like, you know, where, how well is this,

2236
02:07:38,530 --> 02:07:41,820
did they have a department of agriculture
or anything like that? They did.

2237
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:44,860
They checked them spectrum.
I'm sure that you couldn't sell it.

2238
02:07:45,070 --> 02:07:48,160
My friends who are professional Terry,
who we go to the farm lot,

2239
02:07:48,161 --> 02:07:52,090
it's got a little Thai boxing gym out
there and we go be going there for a

2240
02:07:52,090 --> 02:07:55,900
couple of years and he was a professional
hunter for a long time and he's like,

2241
02:07:56,500 --> 02:08:00,490
yeah, bull riders who got me into it.
And he turned around and it's like, man,

2242
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:04,150
I've never eat kangaroo. Like I'd been
shooting these things since I was a kid.

2243
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:08,410
He said, man, if you saw what was
in them like and how we did it,

2244
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:11,060
you probably wouldn't eat it.
Now that's only one person was,

2245
02:08:12,100 --> 02:08:13,090
a lot of them had worms,

2246
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:16,540
but it might just be that check
might just be that in the area.

2247
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:20,030
I don't know how he got on this topic
so much, but it's a good topic. Pigs,

2248
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:22,540
kangaroos.
The thing is,

2249
02:08:22,541 --> 02:08:25,900
funny enough I was saying or doing
when we went out to the farm, you know,

2250
02:08:25,901 --> 02:08:29,470
I'm very conscious of my diet. I'm
sure you guys are too, you know. Um,

2251
02:08:29,830 --> 02:08:32,040
we went out to the farm,
the farm boys, they,

2252
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:34,780
they tend to not really think about diet.

2253
02:08:34,810 --> 02:08:38,800
So they'll eat red meat sometimes and a
red ball and that's all they'll eat for

2254
02:08:38,801 --> 02:08:40,750
three days. Vegetables. I mean,

2255
02:08:40,751 --> 02:08:43,030
they do obviously sit down and have
a meal here and there, you know?

2256
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:44,980
But we went out there and Dylan,

2257
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:48,100
I was sitting there and we bought our
suppliers in our little bag and you know,

2258
02:08:48,101 --> 02:08:52,720
we had our snacks and our this and that
and we were eating all the time eating

2259
02:08:52,721 --> 02:08:55,690
all the time. Right? And the
boys didn't really eat much.

2260
02:08:55,750 --> 02:08:58,960
And after a while we realized we
were eating because we're anxious,

2261
02:08:58,961 --> 02:09:03,130
we're not used to having nothing to do
and we're just automatically pull out a

2262
02:09:03,131 --> 02:09:04,690
bar and just start eating it,
you know?

2263
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:07,900
And after a while we just
started doing what the boys did.

2264
02:09:07,901 --> 02:09:10,120
And I started thinking,
man, I'm going to get sick.

2265
02:09:10,121 --> 02:09:13,780
I'm going to feel gross and feel
unhealthy. But after a couple of days,

2266
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:15,160
I started to realize like,

2267
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:20,340
I think we put a bit too much emphasis
on what we eat because we ate red meat

2268
02:09:20,471 --> 02:09:23,980
straight for four days almost.
And we had a little bit of this and that.

2269
02:09:24,430 --> 02:09:27,970
And because we weren't eating a lot of it,
we actually felt quite healthy.

2270
02:09:28,450 --> 02:09:31,450
Like as an our body adapted to kind
of just doing what we were doing.

2271
02:09:32,010 --> 02:09:34,270
I was really concerned. I was
like, man, I don't feel queasy,

2272
02:09:34,271 --> 02:09:36,100
I'm going to get constant,
you know like all that sort of stuff.

2273
02:09:36,610 --> 02:09:40,300
But when you're out there and you're
doing and you're just eating it,

2274
02:09:40,330 --> 02:09:44,670
it seems like maybe we overemphasize
veggies. No, I don't think so.

2275
02:09:44,930 --> 02:09:46,540
It's certainly not a balanced diet.

2276
02:09:46,570 --> 02:09:50,260
I mean you could get away with it for a
few days if you took that on for several

2277
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:52,330
months.
He probably traditional deficiencies.

2278
02:09:52,590 --> 02:09:56,860
Think the funniest thing was like first
time what my brother up there and I've

2279
02:09:56,861 --> 02:10:00,490
got like my jacket on and I've got like
ammunition and I've got my nice survival

2280
02:10:00,491 --> 02:10:04,060
kit, bandage for snakes and I'm
like pulling it out to check.

2281
02:10:04,061 --> 02:10:06,850
I've got everything by tortures.
Liam pulls out a,

2282
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:09,640
he pulls out a sandwich bag with salad.

2283
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:14,530
I can't eat without salary. You, you're
trying to impress the farm boys man.

2284
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:17,110
You bring him a salad. I bought my
own vegetables cause I was like,

2285
02:10:17,111 --> 02:10:19,050
I can't eat meat without much loss,
you know,

2286
02:10:19,110 --> 02:10:22,590
crocodile bag of salad and my cucumber.
Some layers.

2287
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:24,280
How long did that stuffs they good for?

2288
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:28,570
Oh we had a call for like three days
or something, you know. But anyway,

2289
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:31,050
it's just one of those
things where their diet you,

2290
02:10:31,060 --> 02:10:34,340
my body just adapted to whatever I'd
have to do. You know? That's interesting

2291
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:37,250
man. I would think that after
awhile your body would go dickhead.

2292
02:10:37,390 --> 02:10:42,020
He need a fucking salad or to love money
tokens three days up about three days.

2293
02:10:42,021 --> 02:10:45,830
Four days. You'd be fine. Three or four
days he'd be fine. I felt good actually.

2294
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:47,200
Weirdly,
I dunno,

2295
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:49,760
it was just what I was eating a lot
less than I normally would in the city.

2296
02:10:49,761 --> 02:10:52,610
Like at eat, little pieces of meat,
they'd kill and barbecue and eat it.

2297
02:10:52,630 --> 02:10:56,410
And what kind of meat was it
again? It was rabbit, rabbit, deer.

2298
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:59,840
Just getting really healthy, wild
game. Red Rabbit is out of control.

2299
02:10:59,850 --> 02:11:03,330
There's so much vitamins
and so much nutrition in,

2300
02:11:03,331 --> 02:11:08,240
in wild game too because they're eating
wild grasses and wild plants that are

2301
02:11:08,630 --> 02:11:11,990
just filled with natural nutrients.
This rabid, rabid, sexually.

2302
02:11:11,991 --> 02:11:14,570
One of the best things I've ever made
and I was a bit disappointed by deer,

2303
02:11:14,571 --> 02:11:19,130
but yeah, really good man. How are
you disappointed with deer? It was,

2304
02:11:19,131 --> 02:11:19,964
look we didn't,

2305
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:23,930
you got to stand like we didn't hang it
properly and all that sort of like Yo

2306
02:11:23,931 --> 02:11:26,360
guys is I'll ideas a week.
Cost is, you know what I mean?

2307
02:11:26,361 --> 02:11:30,410
Like Australia's animals are a little
bit wake. It don't really weighty.

2308
02:11:30,730 --> 02:11:35,510
They're not really meeting anyway cause
it's just my opinion. That's interesting.

2309
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:39,110
Some farm is going to punch me in,
but you don't know shit about Dhea,

2310
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:41,460
but it's not common to get DNA.

2311
02:11:41,470 --> 02:11:45,600
We were in Canada and there was deer
on the side of the road. Walking sale.

2312
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:50,330
I'll walk in. Oh yeah. You can get that
all over the place. Well certain places,

2313
02:11:50,331 --> 02:11:51,500
like in Pennsylvania,

2314
02:11:51,530 --> 02:11:54,650
there's certain parts of Pennsylvania
where they change their deer hunting

2315
02:11:54,651 --> 02:11:55,880
season to all year round.

2316
02:11:56,210 --> 02:11:58,910
They just let people shoot them because
they're fucking everywhere and they use

2317
02:11:58,911 --> 02:12:02,930
a, they have a bow season like all year
round and they do it in these areas that

2318
02:12:02,931 --> 02:12:07,510
are like suburban areas. There was a
show on it and on hunting shows. Yup.

2319
02:12:07,740 --> 02:12:10,670
Cause guys set up on,
I mean it was like these estates,

2320
02:12:10,970 --> 02:12:15,230
these beautiful homes that have these
giant pieces of property in like 2030

2321
02:12:15,231 --> 02:12:19,790
acres and they had fucking so many deer
hitting cars or cars hitting deer rather

2322
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,990
deers eating people's lawns and
all kinds of shit. D eating.

2323
02:12:22,991 --> 02:12:27,920
There are gardens rather eating the roses
that they brought in these a hunters

2324
02:12:27,921 --> 02:12:31,460
to set up tree stands in these
suburban neighbors. That's crazy.

2325
02:12:31,570 --> 02:12:35,390
They're all equivalent as a case for us
because we'd love to find deer and shit.

2326
02:12:35,430 --> 02:12:39,140
We'd have a fun day or so. It's pretty
hard to find. People think we're nuts.

2327
02:12:39,141 --> 02:12:41,540
That's a funny thing. He's the
biggest animal lover you've ever bet.

2328
02:12:41,930 --> 02:12:42,830
He's got this big dog.

2329
02:12:42,831 --> 02:12:46,220
Ralphie loves those works for like dog
charities and animal charities and then

2330
02:12:46,221 --> 02:12:47,690
he goes hunting. Yeah. Well,

2331
02:12:47,691 --> 02:12:51,890
people have a hard time with the
idea of cruelty and rightfully so.

2332
02:12:51,950 --> 02:12:55,880
I mean I think people are scared that
people are hunters are evil people that

2333
02:12:55,881 --> 02:12:59,690
want to kill animals. But the
reality is if you're wearing leather,

2334
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:02,600
you're killing animals.
You might not do it with your own hand,

2335
02:13:02,601 --> 02:13:03,141
but you're doing it.

2336
02:13:03,141 --> 02:13:06,500
You're sitting in a chair right now that's
covered in murdered animals, guests.

2337
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:10,220
I've had vegans sitting that was very
chairs that you said it again, rest there,

2338
02:13:10,221 --> 02:13:14,840
but on, on murdered cows. You know
the shoes you wear, the belt you wear.

2339
02:13:15,230 --> 02:13:19,100
And then on top of that, if you buy
organic vegetables and you think you're,

2340
02:13:19,101 --> 02:13:20,830
you're away from your heels,

2341
02:13:20,870 --> 02:13:24,920
they fucking run machines over those
vegetables to collect them and they're

2342
02:13:24,921 --> 02:13:29,030
chopping up a lot of rabbits, a lot
of mice. The more animals are killed,

2343
02:13:29,210 --> 02:13:32,880
more animals are killed per pound of
vegetables that are killed per pound of

2344
02:13:32,881 --> 02:13:34,060
meat. A hug. What?

2345
02:13:34,061 --> 02:13:37,260
What is it about vegans that we'd
just love pissing off a Taser and man,

2346
02:13:37,261 --> 02:13:41,760
it says something about, well there's
self righteous and there's also this,

2347
02:13:41,761 --> 02:13:44,790
this moral high ground that they
like to take and not all of them.

2348
02:13:44,791 --> 02:13:47,310
Some of them are super cool.
I've met a lot of really cool vegans,

2349
02:13:47,311 --> 02:13:50,370
but some of them are really fucking
annoying and they want to tell you that

2350
02:13:50,371 --> 02:13:52,860
they're better than you because
they're Vegan and they want to,

2351
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:56,400
they're proselytizing to, they're always
trying to get other people to be Vegan.

2352
02:13:56,970 --> 02:14:00,930
And this just by the way, this straight
Vegan diet, not that healthy. Yeah,

2353
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:04,770
I'm divorced. Diet is a better diet,
you know, and I'm divorced also.

2354
02:14:04,771 --> 02:14:07,800
You can eat shit like eggs that have
no animal cruelty attached to him

2355
02:14:07,801 --> 02:14:11,700
whatsoever. I have organic eggs
cause I have chickens that are pets.

2356
02:14:11,730 --> 02:14:14,550
I picked my chickens up.
Yeah, I have 14 chickens.

2357
02:14:14,551 --> 02:14:18,660
I could pick them up and hold them and
they give me eggs every day as my left.

2358
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:22,710
That's what he wants to do as my left.
And there's no cruelty involved at all.

2359
02:14:22,711 --> 02:14:25,860
I mean they lay eggs every day.
They don't have,

2360
02:14:25,890 --> 02:14:29,190
I mean there's no potential whatsoever
that egg ever becoming a chicken.

2361
02:14:29,490 --> 02:14:31,920
The only way that egg can become a
chicken as if you have a rooster,

2362
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:35,190
so we only have hens, so the hands
hanging out. They have a good time.

2363
02:14:35,191 --> 02:14:39,600
They have a big yard to run around on and
they eat bugs and worms and everything

2364
02:14:39,601 --> 02:14:43,920
they find in in grass as well.
And then also we give them chicken food.

2365
02:14:44,010 --> 02:14:48,780
That's a healthy actual chickens. No,
you wouldn't kill it. I would, yeah.

2366
02:14:48,781 --> 02:14:51,630
I almost killed one of them. One of
them peck my daughter in the face and I,

2367
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:54,020
I came real close.
My wife was like that little bitch.

2368
02:14:54,021 --> 02:14:57,360
She did it again and I was like,
all right, let's do it. I was ready.

2369
02:14:57,361 --> 02:14:58,820
I was just trying to figure
out how to do it. I had to,

2370
02:14:58,830 --> 02:15:03,690
I was going online and it was almost
like the chicken figured out that we were

2371
02:15:03,691 --> 02:15:06,720
going to fuck it up and it completely
backed off of all of its aggressive

2372
02:15:06,721 --> 02:15:10,470
behavior. It's like a totally felt
the vibe. It was really weird, man.

2373
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:15,090
It's like I was seconds away. I bought
an ax, I was ready to rock and roll.

2374
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:18,750
I was completely ready to, uh, to
cook this chicken up. I'd love,

2375
02:15:18,751 --> 02:15:20,820
I've innovated the fresh
chicken like that. I, I,

2376
02:15:21,390 --> 02:15:26,370
well I was assumed that it's a lot like
other things that you are organic and

2377
02:15:26,371 --> 02:15:27,690
fresh.
They just taste better.

2378
02:15:27,691 --> 02:15:32,450
The eggs taste way better
when you eat organic fresh
eggs. They just, they're the,

2379
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:37,350
first of all, the Yolk is very dark.
It's a dark orange. It's just healthier.

2380
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:41,670
It's very healthy. I ate seven of
them this morning. Yeah. Seven. Yeah.

2381
02:15:41,671 --> 02:15:45,440
I eat them all. I six, seven eggs a day.
Yeah. Hit Him all the time. You know,

2382
02:15:45,450 --> 02:15:48,550
the funny thing is we were
forced vegetarians for the first

2383
02:15:50,230 --> 02:15:53,520
is what do your family want you to be?

2384
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:55,350
But Dad was big into karate and you know,

2385
02:15:55,351 --> 02:15:59,160
like the credit guys that have this kind
of like, they follow different, you know,

2386
02:15:59,161 --> 02:16:02,190
like the catch onto a set philosophy
and he's whole thing made sense.

2387
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:05,010
It was just about full words.
Now look, he just, you know,

2388
02:16:05,011 --> 02:16:09,150
he thought he read all these books and
there was no internet back then. And, um,

2389
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:12,510
you know, he had this idea that you
know, too many hormones in the meat,

2390
02:16:12,511 --> 02:16:13,344
which he's right,

2391
02:16:13,430 --> 02:16:16,410
you've been to Brazil and have you
ever seen a chicken breast in Brazil?

2392
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:19,080
It's about the size of this
table. You know, like it's,

2393
02:16:19,230 --> 02:16:21,720
and you see all these homeless dudes
walking around and they look like they're

2394
02:16:21,721 --> 02:16:23,220
bodybuilders.
But you know what's interesting,

2395
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:26,550
there's a misconception about
chicken breasts and it really is,

2396
02:16:26,551 --> 02:16:28,860
I'm not that they pump
them up with hormones.

2397
02:16:29,230 --> 02:16:33,590
Cattle is what they use hormones on,
but chickens, it's just breeding, right?

2398
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:37,180
Just bread, larger breasted
chickens until they, they, you know,

2399
02:16:37,181 --> 02:16:40,300
only genetically select the
larger breasted chickens.

2400
02:16:40,630 --> 02:16:42,130
And to the point where these chickens,

2401
02:16:42,370 --> 02:16:46,360
they're so large breasted that they
can't fly. You know, chickens can fly,

2402
02:16:46,510 --> 02:16:49,750
they don't fly for very long,
but they can fly for short distances.

2403
02:16:49,751 --> 02:16:54,420
Like my chickens, they have roosts
and they can jump up to the roost.

2404
02:16:54,450 --> 02:16:57,190
They flub them about when they fly up,
up to the roof and then sit there.

2405
02:16:57,520 --> 02:17:02,050
But these chickens aren't going nowhere.
They're fucking giant fat, tits chickens.

2406
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:06,340
And, but it's, it's genetic
selection more than, than hormones.

2407
02:17:06,341 --> 02:17:10,180
Not that chickens haven't
been shot up with hormones
before. Right. With chickens,

2408
02:17:10,510 --> 02:17:14,020
it's more antibiotics that they have to
deal with because they're on top of each

2409
02:17:14,021 --> 02:17:17,350
other and they getting sick all the time
and they're also feeding them chicken.

2410
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:19,870
It's like they're feeding chickens,
chickens,

2411
02:17:19,871 --> 02:17:23,630
they're feeding them chicken shit and
chicken heads and chicken assholes.

2412
02:17:24,970 --> 02:17:27,130
If you feed him healthy diet,

2413
02:17:27,850 --> 02:17:30,430
the omnivorous diet that
a regular chicken eats,

2414
02:17:30,431 --> 02:17:34,480
you get healthier and you get healthier
animals. Yeah, I feed them only grass.

2415
02:17:34,481 --> 02:17:36,970
I mean they,
my chickens eat natural things like that.

2416
02:17:36,971 --> 02:17:40,570
They find when they go out and pack and
they forage in is I have a big yard and

2417
02:17:40,571 --> 02:17:43,900
they run around the yard and they kill
bugs and stuff and then we feed them.

2418
02:17:43,901 --> 02:17:48,270
We also feed them table scraps, so they
eat like beef. They'll eat, they'll eat.

2419
02:17:48,470 --> 02:17:53,210
They'll, they've eaten deer before I fed
them pork, right? They do. Yeah. Yeah.

2420
02:17:53,790 --> 02:17:57,450
They approached me and he do. When you
go home in Thailand, like there's no,

2421
02:17:57,550 --> 02:17:59,680
you don't see a lot of chicken.
It's chicken and the food,

2422
02:17:59,681 --> 02:18:03,400
but it's mainly for Westerners.
But the ties will have their own chickens.

2423
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:07,340
What do they do with them? They go
fighting chickens, chickens on TV.

2424
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:11,470
It's it behind so no one can see, you
know, like oh quick, someone's coming in.

2425
02:18:11,471 --> 02:18:14,390
The white people would come in like put
in your cage, like shoving it aside.

2426
02:18:15,430 --> 02:18:18,730
They're not the ones that the hooks on
there, just like kickboxing, kickboxing,

2427
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:23,230
chicken flush as well.
I have a friend who, uh,

2428
02:18:23,260 --> 02:18:26,110
who does that well, he's a friend, he's a,

2429
02:18:26,140 --> 02:18:31,140
he's a friend of a friend and he has a
a hundred chickens in his backyard and

2430
02:18:31,590 --> 02:18:34,630
he's from Mexico. You know, he, he
barely speaks English. I don't know why,

2431
02:18:34,631 --> 02:18:37,720
but that makes sense. And all of
his friends are from Mexico too.

2432
02:18:37,721 --> 02:18:40,060
And it's kind of interesting. He, he, uh,

2433
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:44,530
he got in trouble for killing a goat
and cooking it in his yard because he

2434
02:18:44,531 --> 02:18:48,070
butchered the goat in his yard and there
they were upset at him for doing that.

2435
02:18:48,460 --> 02:18:51,800
And, uh, he didn't understand cause he's,
you know, he's from Mexico and he's like,

2436
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:55,060
he goes, but, but you eat
meat. Like if you eat meat,

2437
02:18:55,061 --> 02:18:57,430
like what do you care where the,
how the animal gets killed.

2438
02:18:57,700 --> 02:19:01,120
I can't kill it in my yard. Like, and he,
you know, they, they're told him like,

2439
02:19:01,121 --> 02:19:04,390
there's all these regulations. You can't
just kill a goat in your yard. He's like,

2440
02:19:04,810 --> 02:19:07,690
okay, what do I have to do? I had to
bring it somewhere to kill it. Like crazy.

2441
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:10,810
Why can't I just kill it here? There's
a lot of room. I just kill his goat.

2442
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:14,050
Do you think we kind of lost that?
It's a weird thing. Like my, my,

2443
02:19:14,230 --> 02:19:17,400
my wife slash girlfriend weft now,
I'll be ready for like two weeks ago.

2444
02:19:17,490 --> 02:19:20,050
I got married two days
before we went overseas,

2445
02:19:20,051 --> 02:19:24,040
so she went on a honeymoon to Italy
and I went, I went, I went to Canada.

2446
02:19:24,041 --> 02:19:26,440
So I actually haven't seen her since
then or it's just really random, but,

2447
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:28,070
but her mum can kill

2448
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:30,680
a chicken and cook it up, like
you wouldn't believe. Right. Um,

2449
02:19:30,681 --> 02:19:33,890
she's there from a Vietnamese,
she's, she's Aussie, but
her mom's Vietnamese. Right.

2450
02:19:34,190 --> 02:19:38,180
My grandma, and I'm sure your
grandparents could kill a chicken skin it,

2451
02:19:38,181 --> 02:19:42,680
they'd be, you know, make 40 dishes with
it. They'd use the fat, the skin there.

2452
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:46,040
My Dad was telling me, well, our
whole family die of heart disease.

2453
02:19:46,041 --> 02:19:50,780
The oldest one's like 62 and he was
showing their favorite dish was you'd take

2454
02:19:50,781 --> 02:19:55,250
all the leftovers, put on a pan, fry
it, skin bones, everything. Right.

2455
02:19:55,490 --> 02:19:59,160
You'd fry them till it liquefies and then
you pour it into a bottle and then dip

2456
02:19:59,161 --> 02:20:03,590
it in. Nice. And then you take it and
you just wipe it on your bread. Ah, okay.

2457
02:20:03,860 --> 02:20:04,693
Amazing.

2458
02:20:04,780 --> 02:20:09,340
Yeah. Well like a pod tay or something
like that. Well, like a fat pet. Hey,

2459
02:20:09,341 --> 02:20:10,050
but hmm.

2460
02:20:10,050 --> 02:20:13,560
Then you're saying it was his grandma
and his, they're like whole generation.

2461
02:20:13,561 --> 02:20:17,780
They wouldn't have a problem with just
skin. It use every part of its body,

2462
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:18,390
you know,

2463
02:20:18,390 --> 02:20:21,150
that's, that's the lost. The reason
why people don't like hunting,

2464
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:24,390
although they do eat meat. I have friends
that eat meat and we'll never hunt.

2465
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:25,950
They wouldn't do it. He
couldn't do it. I'm like,

2466
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:29,400
I understand you don't want to be cruel.
I don't understand.

2467
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:32,040
And I understand that they
enjoy that separation.

2468
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:35,310
But to criticize people who
don't enjoy that separation,

2469
02:20:35,311 --> 02:20:37,950
I think it's kind of crazy. It's
a, there's a weird disconnect,

2470
02:20:38,580 --> 02:20:42,090
but there's a lot of people that eat
meat and have eaten meat and don't have a

2471
02:20:42,091 --> 02:20:43,450
problem with ordering a cheeseburger,

2472
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:46,760
but it really looked down on people
that hunt. I think it's the ease.

2473
02:20:46,830 --> 02:20:51,360
I think it's not the easiest
way obviously, but I think
it's the easiest on your,

2474
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:55,560
the ethical dilemma is the easiest because
you're, you're dealing with an animal.

2475
02:20:55,561 --> 02:21:00,561
Like that deer right there had no idea
a human being was even a thing until it

2476
02:21:01,511 --> 02:21:04,080
sauce. And then it was dead
moments later. You know,

2477
02:21:04,081 --> 02:21:08,280
I shot that deer in the middle
of the forest in Montana. I mean,

2478
02:21:08,281 --> 02:21:12,690
that fucking deer was living in the
wild country of Montana and it was

2479
02:21:12,691 --> 02:21:14,730
delicious.
And I had no problem with it.

2480
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:16,350
I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

2481
02:21:16,351 --> 02:21:19,590
And the idea that somehow or
another it's okay to, to eat a cow,

2482
02:21:19,591 --> 02:21:21,900
but it's not okay to do that. And
then other people will tell you, oh,

2483
02:21:21,901 --> 02:21:26,220
buy only organic grass fed dear.
Let me tell you. Or grass fed cows.

2484
02:21:26,221 --> 02:21:27,510
Let me tell you something about that.

2485
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:32,160
I have a friend who keeps organic grass
fed cows and those mother fuckers are

2486
02:21:32,161 --> 02:21:36,960
terrified. You go near them, they run,
they run and they all huddle up together.

2487
02:21:37,470 --> 02:21:38,430
Yeah.
You know why?

2488
02:21:38,431 --> 02:21:41,100
Because they know that they're going
to die and they know someone's going to

2489
02:21:41,101 --> 02:21:44,880
shoot them and eat them. Like this idea
that if you eat organic grass fed cows,

2490
02:21:44,881 --> 02:21:48,090
you're somehow or another were removed
from the cruelty. Yeah, they aren't,

2491
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:52,650
they aren't kept in a pen.
They aren't jammed into some pig box like,

2492
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:56,670
like pigs are. And they do run
around free and they do eat grass,

2493
02:21:56,850 --> 02:21:59,460
but they're fucking shit in their pants.
Anytime a person

2494
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:05,360
we, we, we did some, um, city
boys did some cow herding man.

2495
02:22:05,361 --> 02:22:09,140
Northern is that fucking terrifying if
you're in a pin with these cows? I mean,

2496
02:22:09,320 --> 02:22:12,980
they don't attack humans, but they're the
big, if you've ever been in a passive,

2497
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:17,930
cows are big animals. Just crazy
bitches drag riding on them. The males,

2498
02:22:17,931 --> 02:22:20,790
remember I was like the first one I
was like, he did, he did a job done,

2499
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:23,660
messed around and jumped on a cow too.

2500
02:22:23,830 --> 02:22:28,110
There's a whole bunch of buck like
bowls do not use the old ones,

2501
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:30,870
but that will run each other into a corner
and kill each other. Like, you know,

2502
02:22:30,871 --> 02:22:34,320
like this is so silly though, will
they're very big. Would you eat dog?

2503
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:38,040
Would I love dogs?
Um,

2504
02:22:38,070 --> 02:22:40,290
if I was in another country and uh,

2505
02:22:40,320 --> 02:22:42,870
maybe it was like for a television show
or something like that and they were

2506
02:22:42,871 --> 02:22:46,530
serving dog like fee effect, I would
have a real hard time with it. Still.

2507
02:22:46,531 --> 02:22:49,890
I might do it just to see what it
tastes like and just to, you know,

2508
02:22:49,980 --> 02:22:53,430
if I was over someone's home and they
offered it to me and it was a part of

2509
02:22:53,431 --> 02:22:54,264
their culture,

2510
02:22:54,390 --> 02:22:57,390
I don't think that I would insult
them and say that I wouldn't eat it.

2511
02:22:57,900 --> 02:23:00,000
And if I eat pig,

2512
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:03,600
I mean pig and dog are
supposed to be like a dog,

2513
02:23:03,610 --> 02:23:06,600
supposed to be actually as intelligent
or more, or excuse me, a pig.

2514
02:23:06,830 --> 02:23:09,480
It's supposed to be as intelligent
or more than a dog. Yeah.

2515
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:13,650
So it'd be a bit hypocritical.
But I have a deep connection with dogs.

2516
02:23:13,710 --> 02:23:18,090
I've had dogs my whole life and I have
two dogs now and I love dogs. I love him.

2517
02:23:18,440 --> 02:23:23,080
Seven people. This guy sat me down for
intervention cause you ain't gotta go.

2518
02:23:23,530 --> 02:23:27,550
Yeah, I've got a massive French
mastiffs. I love it. It's $2,000 a week,

2519
02:23:27,970 --> 02:23:30,730
but it's a lot.
Had He ogs an investment.

2520
02:23:31,970 --> 02:23:36,880
Yeah, I have a massive to do you have a
regency mastiff? If it's a little smaller,

2521
02:23:36,910 --> 02:23:39,910
they're, they're, uh,
like 120, 140 pounds.

2522
02:23:40,090 --> 02:23:44,510
This guy goes up to about 90
kilograms. What's that? 200 pounds.

2523
02:23:45,250 --> 02:23:49,810
It's a big boy. It's a big dog, but
he had a lot of joint problems. Right?

2524
02:23:50,050 --> 02:23:54,010
Those poor dogs. Yeah. My mind starting
to get a little arthritis in his hips.

2525
02:23:54,640 --> 02:23:56,590
Not Bad. He goes, me and he's, he runs and

2526
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:03,490
what was the very slobbery? The
sweetest dogs ever. Yeah. My, my,

2527
02:24:03,491 --> 02:24:05,560
my dog is like so great with my kids.
You know,

2528
02:24:05,561 --> 02:24:09,550
they go over and grab his face and kiss.
He's got no anger in him.

2529
02:24:09,790 --> 02:24:14,350
The regency massive was raised to,
uh, to have no human aggression.

2530
02:24:14,790 --> 02:24:18,790
Sweet dogs, no dog aggression
either. They're real good.
Great with other dogs too.

2531
02:24:19,540 --> 02:24:20,000
What was the wedding

2532
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,520
dimension? Intervention.
I'm not allowed to put up,

2533
02:24:24,940 --> 02:24:26,150
put up to eight dog pictures.

2534
02:24:26,580 --> 02:24:31,580
The problem is right boys
back home typically to get
your dog even bid should in

2535
02:24:31,681 --> 02:24:34,370
this show. Of course. Yeah. They're going
to be like, oh, you mentioned Ralph.

2536
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:39,170
It is a weird thing, right? You love dogs,

2537
02:24:39,171 --> 02:24:42,180
but you also love hunting
dog assessed with dogs.

2538
02:24:43,550 --> 02:24:43,821
Well,

2539
02:24:43,821 --> 02:24:47,030
there's a bond that humans have with
dogs and especially that's a thing that

2540
02:24:47,031 --> 02:24:50,450
people don't understand that dogs and
hunting have gone hand in hand forever.

2541
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:53,780
One of the reasons why we have such a
tight bond with dogs in the first place is

2542
02:24:53,781 --> 02:24:56,960
that dogs were used not
just to keep animals away,

2543
02:24:56,961 --> 02:24:59,810
like keep the wolves away from camps,
but to help people hunt.

2544
02:25:00,690 --> 02:25:02,850
He was devastated when we were in Vietnam.

2545
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:07,110
They serve just some starters
and afterwards we didn't
know what they were and

2546
02:25:07,410 --> 02:25:09,970
he discovered he didn't
his man's best friend.

2547
02:25:09,971 --> 02:25:14,720
So that took about a year or two tasted
funny. It didn't taste right. It was,

2548
02:25:15,130 --> 02:25:18,780
but this kind of explain it. This guy
is like comes, he retired from fighting.

2549
02:25:19,110 --> 02:25:23,160
So the first thing he does is replaced
fighting with pictures of dogs.

2550
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:26,480
It's like we're running a business,
you know what I mean? Like put some

2551
02:25:28,570 --> 02:25:30,550
pictures of your tattoos up
with something and you know,

2552
02:25:30,551 --> 02:25:34,300
like not the fucking dog actually did I
actually, I was like, Look Dylan, listen,

2553
02:25:34,690 --> 02:25:38,770
you know, like, you know you love Moitai.
I get that. But you've got to understand,

2554
02:25:38,771 --> 02:25:39,700
people want to see it.

2555
02:25:39,910 --> 02:25:44,020
Thai boxer that's got a little bit
of like book book book out about him,

2556
02:25:44,021 --> 02:25:44,680
you know,

2557
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:49,680
and you know it's him and it's that bloody
[inaudible] with his tattoo and look

2558
02:25:50,351 --> 02:25:54,360
into six pack and stuff. Right? This
guy's with fucking slobbery dog runner.

2559
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:58,440
You know, like I'm like, okay, you're
allowed one picture or a week Instagram.

2560
02:25:58,740 --> 02:26:03,050
The rest of the winter face never set any
rules. And I said, the restaurant Moy,

2561
02:26:03,051 --> 02:26:05,690
Tai, I don't want to use these
fucking around with business. Well,

2562
02:26:05,691 --> 02:26:07,300
why don't you just do it
on your personal account?

2563
02:26:07,940 --> 02:26:10,840
They're kind of the same thing.
It's all interconnected.

2564
02:26:10,870 --> 02:26:15,250
It's Instagram and he's got his
own Instagram and it's hot dogs.

2565
02:26:16,470 --> 02:26:19,860
The dog goes, Ron loves Ralphy. Yeah,

2566
02:26:20,350 --> 02:26:22,300
I love dogs too.
I love animals.

2567
02:26:22,770 --> 02:26:25,420
That's something that people
have a weird problem with,

2568
02:26:25,421 --> 02:26:28,150
but they don't have a weird problem with
loving animals and then feeding their

2569
02:26:28,151 --> 02:26:28,961
animals.
Animals.

2570
02:26:28,961 --> 02:26:33,130
Like I have friends who fucking are
vegans and they have cats and I'm like,

2571
02:26:33,131 --> 02:26:37,000
do you under fucking stand
that cats only eat meat?

2572
02:26:37,140 --> 02:26:41,050
It's not like a dog. A dog can
eat carrots, a dog can eat grains.

2573
02:26:41,051 --> 02:26:42,040
Got dogs eat rice.

2574
02:26:42,041 --> 02:26:46,080
Like if I have a friend who cooks
for his dog and that happen,

2575
02:26:46,390 --> 02:26:51,340
he gets his dog ground beef and mixes
it with potatoes and rice and it's

2576
02:26:51,341 --> 02:26:54,920
delicious. You do that for your dog.
Cool. It's good. Probably herself,

2577
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:57,820
but you can't do that with a
cat if you can do with the cat.

2578
02:26:57,821 --> 02:27:00,580
It has to be just animal protein.
That's it.

2579
02:27:00,581 --> 02:27:03,000
That's the only thing that
cat is allowed to eat. Yeah.

2580
02:27:03,030 --> 02:27:04,930
You can't feed cats grains.

2581
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:08,290
Cats are not supposed to eat rice
that's supposed to eat carrots.

2582
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:12,550
Cats eat fish and they eat chicken and
the beef and they liver and they eat.

2583
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:17,350
They eat animal protein. They're
carnivores, their straight carnivores.

2584
02:27:17,590 --> 02:27:21,490
So for you to be a Vegan and have
a fucking cat living in your house,

2585
02:27:21,491 --> 02:27:25,240
like you're involved in the killing of
animals, whether you like it or not,

2586
02:27:25,470 --> 02:27:29,560
I mean, I guess there's probably some
Vegan cat food, but I can't imagine it.

2587
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:33,220
Let's go kill that right now. Probably
kill the cat. It's probably not good.

2588
02:27:33,221 --> 02:27:35,910
Vegan cat food bad.
Let's,

2589
02:27:35,930 --> 02:27:39,000
let's look up fat cat bat.

2590
02:27:39,220 --> 02:27:43,760
That's one of my two flybys
cats. Okay. Vegan cat food. Know.

2591
02:27:44,410 --> 02:27:48,610
I just would imagine that shit is not
good. That's basically mini lines.

2592
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:53,770
Oh look, it says actually, and the Vegan
cat foods contained adequate amounts.

2593
02:27:53,770 --> 02:27:58,300
Is it okay to raise a cat and Vegan?
I think it's hilarious,

2594
02:27:58,301 --> 02:28:01,270
by the way. I think that
is fucking hilarious. Now,

2595
02:28:01,271 --> 02:28:04,170
artists into activists with more than
one field on the family and Ithaca,

2596
02:28:04,190 --> 02:28:08,620
New York, more in her partner, Shariah
Golding. That means they're lesbians.

2597
02:28:08,650 --> 02:28:13,570
What a surprise lesbian vegans with cats,
that's crazy. You never hear about that.

2598
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:15,220
Relatively small,

2599
02:28:15,221 --> 02:28:19,240
but deeply dedicated group of Vegan pet
owners who believe their cats and dogs

2600
02:28:19,241 --> 02:28:23,660
die as she reflect their own beliefs
about the treatment of animals and the

2601
02:28:23,661 --> 02:28:26,780
environmentally sustainable,
sustainable lifestyles.

2602
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:31,700
Is it okay to give your diet of
spare me all the Foa, outrage,

2603
02:28:32,700 --> 02:28:33,950
outrage of the billions of land,

2604
02:28:33,951 --> 02:28:37,430
animals and trillions of sea animals
tortured and killed each year in the u s

2605
02:28:37,850 --> 02:28:42,590
alone for food to feed people and
pets? I don't know, man. You know,

2606
02:28:42,620 --> 02:28:45,740
you leave a cat outside that
cat's gonna kill a bird. That,

2607
02:28:45,741 --> 02:28:48,680
that's sweet kitty cat that
you have as a murderer. Yeah.

2608
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:51,590
My cat makes these crazy noises.
When he looks outside,

2609
02:28:51,900 --> 02:28:56,640
he sees like something like a squirrel.
His whole jaw starts, he start,

2610
02:28:56,641 --> 02:28:59,420
their jaws start moving up and down.
Like they can't help it.

2611
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:04,400
Like they just thinking about biting. I
till, have you ever had a fight? Dreams?

2612
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:07,890
Like what? You wake up kicking, you
know, you know those dreams? Well,

2613
02:29:08,070 --> 02:29:10,980
cats have those when they
see a fucking animal,

2614
02:29:10,981 --> 02:29:14,220
if they want to kill because
it's like that. They have reflux,

2615
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:19,160
they make noises.
He's just looks out the window.

2616
02:29:19,850 --> 02:29:23,300
Have you ever watched
them like stalk a stalk,

2617
02:29:23,470 --> 02:29:26,920
stoke your leg and then watch a lion?

2618
02:29:26,970 --> 02:29:28,520
There's very little difference.

2619
02:29:29,060 --> 02:29:31,970
You're like a lion crawling through the
grass or a cat crow in three. A kaput.

2620
02:29:32,930 --> 02:29:36,950
Yeah. Look, they look identical. Oh yeah,
absolutely identical. They're murderers,

2621
02:29:36,951 --> 02:29:40,350
bro. They are fucking
murderers apparently. Um,

2622
02:29:40,460 --> 02:29:43,070
what they're saying is for a lot of these,

2623
02:29:43,140 --> 02:29:46,370
a lot of these people that
are there making these, uh,

2624
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:48,360
these diets for these dogs,

2625
02:29:48,361 --> 02:29:52,960
there's like a big debate on whether
or not it's healthy for the dogs.

2626
02:29:52,970 --> 02:29:56,240
It's about the Vegas. He can
die. It's for, for dogs and cats,

2627
02:29:56,420 --> 02:29:57,960
whether or not it's a matter of,
uh,

2628
02:29:58,100 --> 02:30:01,940
the animal getting all the
proper nutrients or just
being able to stay alive.

2629
02:30:02,390 --> 02:30:06,740
So I don't really understand people's
relationships with dogs in that sense.

2630
02:30:06,770 --> 02:30:10,860
Like I get the whole, like
men having a dog, but people
get weird. So like we have,

2631
02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:14,710
we know a, um, a friend
of a friend who, um,

2632
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:19,070
told us they have a patient
who's got munch houses, you
know, winch houses. Yeah.

2633
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:20,900
Basically.

2634
02:30:20,900 --> 02:30:25,640
So they basically make up things so
that you can get their dog operated on.

2635
02:30:26,310 --> 02:30:28,320
Like it's just like as an them,

2636
02:30:28,321 --> 02:30:31,900
so that they have an excuse to get
an operation on the adult psych.

2637
02:30:32,010 --> 02:30:33,790
Like it's like that kid.
Oh.

2638
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:39,710
Apparently what they're saying is that
dogs and cats have a much different

2639
02:30:39,711 --> 02:30:43,550
nutritional requirements than
human beings. And that the, uh,

2640
02:30:43,551 --> 02:30:46,520
they need much higher protein
intake than a human does.

2641
02:30:46,850 --> 02:30:51,770
So especially dogs can eat a bunch of
other shit like yams and potatoes and all

2642
02:30:51,771 --> 02:30:55,070
these different things and it's okay as
long as they get sufficient amount of

2643
02:30:55,071 --> 02:30:55,371
protein,

2644
02:30:55,371 --> 02:30:59,330
but it's almost impossible to get the
amount of protein that a dog needs with

2645
02:30:59,331 --> 02:31:04,320
just plants and cats. It's a
fucking joke. Cancer, you know,

2646
02:31:04,680 --> 02:31:06,230
here's what, you know, put,

2647
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:09,260
put layouts and fucking meat
and lay out a bowl of beans.

2648
02:31:10,460 --> 02:31:14,140
See where fluffy goes. Fluffy.
No, you're not a murderer.

2649
02:31:14,150 --> 02:31:18,830
Fluffy dogs. Just choking down
these pieces of meat, you know,

2650
02:31:19,090 --> 02:31:20,070
have the yams

2651
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:24,430
fluffy fucking ridiculous.
Here's the caps.

2652
02:31:24,460 --> 02:31:28,640
We would shut the fuck up.
That thing's a murderer, man.

2653
02:31:28,650 --> 02:31:33,210
You're going to keep it. Keep
it from being a murderer.
It's, it's nature. I mean,

2654
02:31:33,240 --> 02:31:37,350
you know, it's what it does. That's
what a cat does. It's kind of comedy,

2655
02:31:37,351 --> 02:31:39,240
like everybody who's been pushing all the,

2656
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:43,110
like the Tofu and all the soy stuff
over the last couple of years,

2657
02:31:43,380 --> 02:31:46,160
it's starting to get breast cancer in men.
It's just,

2658
02:31:47,080 --> 02:31:48,270
you're discovering it's bad for you.

2659
02:31:48,271 --> 02:31:51,750
I say that stuff instead of milk and
I'd always feel sick, but I was like,

2660
02:31:51,751 --> 02:31:53,730
it's gotta be healthy for you.
Everyone keeps telling me that.

2661
02:31:54,110 --> 02:31:58,600
[inaudible] Bibbs that's why I have boobs.
Yeah.

2662
02:31:58,650 --> 02:32:02,400
Even vegan cats.com is telling
people to feed their cats meet.

2663
02:32:03,090 --> 02:32:04,830
That's when shit gets real.

2664
02:32:05,340 --> 02:32:09,120
When Vegan cats.com tells
people to feed their cats,

2665
02:32:09,140 --> 02:32:11,070
meet after much soul searching.

2666
02:32:11,550 --> 02:32:14,100
We've decided that we need
to keep our cats alone.

2667
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:18,870
We only feed them asshole cows.
Cows,

2668
02:32:18,871 --> 02:32:23,300
it stomp on rats or something.
She walks into a room.

2669
02:32:23,330 --> 02:32:25,730
I'm gone.
Cat White cat

2670
02:32:27,510 --> 02:32:31,710
cats and hookers. Hookers.
You hate strippers,

2671
02:32:31,770 --> 02:32:35,010
man in Thailand. He just said one
touches him. He just freaks out.

2672
02:32:35,070 --> 02:32:39,440
Is that because of your experiences
in in Thailand or is it just like a,

2673
02:32:39,441 --> 02:32:43,920
it's like a thing in your DNA
perhaps from past lives maybe.

2674
02:32:44,070 --> 02:32:47,100
Will you ever stop to death by a
hooker or a stripper dude back.

2675
02:32:47,101 --> 02:32:49,560
She's talking about that you
haven't gone to Thailand.

2676
02:32:50,200 --> 02:32:53,700
I don't know if you ever go to Thailand,
man. The most vicious things you've seen.

2677
02:32:53,701 --> 02:32:57,690
You sit in the hospitals,
the chicks with the guys they bottle.

2678
02:32:57,870 --> 02:33:00,700
Like if you're going to fall with a guy
that chicks the hook chicks all Yay,

2679
02:33:00,760 --> 02:33:05,260
smash a bottle. Like they're like known
for it. And especially like Petaja. Yeah,

2680
02:33:05,310 --> 02:33:06,690
like that area.
The chicks,

2681
02:33:06,691 --> 02:33:08,850
the first thing of a guy gets
an arguing with another guy,

2682
02:33:08,860 --> 02:33:13,230
they'll stand up for them and bottle
the dude over her shoulder bottling.

2683
02:33:13,231 --> 02:33:16,780
I don't know what it is so effective.
Especially if you're a woman,

2684
02:33:16,810 --> 02:33:18,060
you don't have a lot of physical strength.

2685
02:33:18,410 --> 02:33:22,950
You hit a guy with a bottle and open
them up like a fucking tomato. Yeah.

2686
02:33:23,160 --> 02:33:27,480
Bottles are scary. Shit. When I lived
in Boston, I saw an argument over,

2687
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:31,890
I don't know what the argument was
because I was a fair bit of way.

2688
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:32,753
Like you know,

2689
02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:36,720
several others by these guys were arguing
and the guy's first move was to hit

2690
02:33:36,721 --> 02:33:39,690
this guy in the face with a
Heineken bottle. It was horrible.

2691
02:33:39,750 --> 02:33:41,010
It just caught him wide open.

2692
02:33:41,011 --> 02:33:44,460
He's bleeding all over the place and
they tackled the guy who did it and the

2693
02:33:44,461 --> 02:33:47,460
bouncers beat the shit out of him.
But I remember thinking like, man,

2694
02:33:47,820 --> 02:33:50,040
you gotta be real fucking
careful who you're fighting with,

2695
02:33:50,041 --> 02:33:51,480
who you're arguing with.
Addison it,

2696
02:33:51,540 --> 02:33:55,320
this guy just smashed this guy
and it just caught them open.

2697
02:33:55,321 --> 02:33:59,040
It's bleeding everywhere,
Matt. Good. Yeah,

2698
02:33:59,070 --> 02:34:01,590
but you know what the thing I was going
to say is I'd always shocks me when you

2699
02:34:01,591 --> 02:34:04,710
see dudes in another country
like Vietnam, Thailand, Brazil,

2700
02:34:04,711 --> 02:34:05,970
starting fights with the locals.

2701
02:34:06,530 --> 02:34:09,840
Don't fucking thinking people
were stupid as fuck man.

2702
02:34:10,320 --> 02:34:13,500
I think it's probably just DNA,

2703
02:34:13,530 --> 02:34:17,760
like wanting to get eradicated.
Like you have some shitty jeans and your

2704
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:20,680
Eugene's want you just to
be taken out of the mix.

2705
02:34:21,110 --> 02:34:25,480
You know it's like a suicide
pill. Fuck Thailand. They're like,

2706
02:34:25,481 --> 02:34:29,620
Oh really? Okay. You have no idea
and you're drunk every night.

2707
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:32,470
So I'm sure they start a fight with a
taxi driver and the whole of Thailand

2708
02:34:32,471 --> 02:34:36,310
jumps in. Do you live in Thailand now or
do you go back and forth? Back and forth?

2709
02:34:36,700 --> 02:34:41,020
Since I was 18 I'm 31 so wow. Long
time. And you tried to live there?

2710
02:34:41,260 --> 02:34:44,680
I tried to live there, but you know, it's
actually, I mean like I love Thai people.

2711
02:34:45,010 --> 02:34:49,810
I love the country. I love everything
about it. It's very ancient.

2712
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:53,560
It's free, there's no rush. It's
beautiful. The Thai people are amazing.

2713
02:34:53,561 --> 02:34:58,480
Most of my friends there are tight.
But um, you know, after awhile

2714
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:01,330
you just get,
I'll just go a little bit bored.

2715
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:07,090
I had my brother back in Sydney as well.
He was running the gym. Um, you know,

2716
02:35:07,180 --> 02:35:07,810
he got up,

2717
02:35:07,810 --> 02:35:12,010
he got to stage where he was doing the
rescue and I think he got really attached

2718
02:35:12,011 --> 02:35:15,910
to not just, and that meant, you
know, the thing of saying like,

2719
02:35:15,980 --> 02:35:18,910
we were talking about this
before me and him like, you know,

2720
02:35:18,911 --> 02:35:20,560
like when you finished
profile and what do you do?

2721
02:35:21,310 --> 02:35:23,890
And I think like it was kind
of like, you're not, you know,

2722
02:35:23,910 --> 02:35:26,920
you're doing all this fighting and
you being admired and your brain and

2723
02:35:26,970 --> 02:35:31,330
everybody's doin and afterwards you
stop and you're just like, well now,

2724
02:35:31,331 --> 02:35:33,490
so he's going over to
Thailand and you know,

2725
02:35:33,491 --> 02:35:36,280
he's rescuing people and it's suddenly
a feeling important again. Right.

2726
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:39,940
But he got really attached and I'm
actually at one stage I wanted to go live

2727
02:35:39,941 --> 02:35:42,550
there and um,
we had a,

2728
02:35:42,551 --> 02:35:44,890
we had a few arguments about
it and eventually I just said,

2729
02:35:44,891 --> 02:35:48,430
I think you should go because I didn't
want it that Jim had made a be holding

2730
02:35:48,431 --> 02:35:50,920
him back and he went there and
two months later he's like,

2731
02:35:50,921 --> 02:35:51,754
I'm ready to come home.

2732
02:35:52,150 --> 02:35:55,900
Did you ever think about competing in
Jujitsu to maybe just explain spark your

2733
02:35:55,901 --> 02:35:58,150
competitive desires and
avoid like head trauma?

2734
02:35:58,990 --> 02:36:03,460
I competed it a fair bit in Jujitsu
and I loved it, you know? Um,

2735
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:08,170
but you know, I dunno like when I
hit, when I was there for those two,

2736
02:36:08,171 --> 02:36:12,040
three months last year, luckily I'm set.
I got really addicted to the abbots.

2737
02:36:12,041 --> 02:36:16,000
It was an adrenaline rush. Like
why cops say that? Well, you know,

2738
02:36:16,001 --> 02:36:19,270
you hear the radio go off. I listened
to the coat. I'm thinking, okay,

2739
02:36:19,271 --> 02:36:23,080
it's a car accident. There could be,
we could be cutting people out of cars.

2740
02:36:23,081 --> 02:36:26,800
We could be saving people, you know,
one accident I'll wait to like,

2741
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:30,910
I was trying to actually put back
three bodies back together over like,

2742
02:36:31,590 --> 02:36:34,700
I don't know, quarter mile and a hundred
meters. It's less than a quarter mile.

2743
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:35,501
How'd you meet her?

2744
02:36:35,501 --> 02:36:39,550
Is trying to put everyone back together
and it was a crazy adrenaline rush.

2745
02:36:39,970 --> 02:36:40,781
Put them back together,

2746
02:36:40,781 --> 02:36:44,560
meaning saved a lot of figure out
whose arm and leg was who's, oh Geez.

2747
02:36:44,561 --> 02:36:48,550
Two blacks collided dead people.
Lots and lots of bodies.

2748
02:36:48,551 --> 02:36:51,220
There's an adrenaline rush and
trying to figure out dope puzzles.

2749
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:53,170
They're dretler rush.
Wasn't that,

2750
02:36:53,410 --> 02:36:56,290
I think I became like a little
bit desensitized to everything.

2751
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:59,260
Like nothing bothered me.
I've seen everything,

2752
02:36:59,710 --> 02:37:04,270
but it was more when the alarm went off
in my little rescue about to set us a

2753
02:37:04,271 --> 02:37:09,130
room half this size of this and you
hear the code and all you hear is it's a

2754
02:37:09,131 --> 02:37:12,100
car. There's an accident, but
you don't know how many people,

2755
02:37:12,101 --> 02:37:15,620
you don't know anything. So you get
there and it could be like five cars.

2756
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:19,220
One time we got there,
I was driving and they hated me driving.

2757
02:37:19,830 --> 02:37:21,320
Like I was telling my brother in the car,

2758
02:37:21,380 --> 02:37:26,000
why is it was like a v eight turbocharged
ambulances thing and they said I'm a

2759
02:37:26,001 --> 02:37:29,450
bad driver. I drove a Lamborghini
yesterday up at Vegas that was sick.

2760
02:37:29,490 --> 02:37:33,370
Or you went to one of those
places where you go, Oh yeah man,

2761
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:36,140
I trust me by seeing I'd be driving.

2762
02:37:36,290 --> 02:37:39,620
And then after awhile they
started racing me to the,

2763
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:43,790
to the driver's seat cause I just laid
next to the ambulance and he used to race

2764
02:37:43,791 --> 02:37:46,520
me there and I was like, man,
why did they, you know, I said,

2765
02:37:46,550 --> 02:37:51,020
why do you guys like me driving into more?
Said Dylan when you drive man,

2766
02:37:51,230 --> 02:37:55,220
where every religion and it sat with me
and I'm thinking what the hell are they

2767
02:37:55,221 --> 02:37:59,450
talking about? And they go, man,
we're Christian. We prayed to Allah,

2768
02:37:59,451 --> 02:38:03,170
we pray to Jesus Jewish goodnight.
You are such a mat.

2769
02:38:03,171 --> 02:38:08,171
You such a crazy driver that pretty
much pretty every God just in case

2770
02:38:09,130 --> 02:38:13,330
the fuck you did. You went from
motorcycle racing. Too many concussions.

2771
02:38:13,331 --> 02:38:16,150
I'll try kickboxing.
You go to fucking Thai boxing,

2772
02:38:16,151 --> 02:38:19,300
you become a world champion in Thai
boxing. Hmm. Not Enough Thrill.

2773
02:38:19,420 --> 02:38:24,010
I need a ride fucking bowls. Oh it
along the line. I can go rescue people.

2774
02:38:24,011 --> 02:38:28,240
Let's do it. Hey, what an adrenaline rush
I putting together bodies. Absolutely.

2775
02:38:28,470 --> 02:38:29,303
Yeah.

2776
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:33,820
One thing I thought was interesting about
it though is you know he became quite

2777
02:38:33,821 --> 02:38:36,250
detached for a while eating candy
the whole time you hear it too.

2778
02:38:36,251 --> 02:38:40,330
What are you doing? You've
got a candy thing? Nah, just
sees it soothing my throat.

2779
02:38:40,331 --> 02:38:43,060
Your throat. Okay. Yeah. Both
of us got plenty of Vegas.

2780
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:44,350
He kind of escaped the smoke.

2781
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:48,400
That strategy cuts smoke indoors most
of the time you can't smoke indoors in

2782
02:38:48,401 --> 02:38:53,230
America. Most places Texas a few places
I think in Texas allow it, but it,

2783
02:38:53,231 --> 02:38:56,710
Vegas is one of the few places
left where you can smoke indoors,

2784
02:38:56,950 --> 02:38:57,783
but they have so many,

2785
02:38:57,910 --> 02:39:00,940
I don't usually have a problem with it
because they have so many like filters

2786
02:39:00,941 --> 02:39:04,550
and man, we got air cleaning
systems. Where'd you guys go? Uh,

2787
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:09,790
you know Joe in Australia now. I think
you better look it up, but just in case.

2788
02:39:09,800 --> 02:39:13,630
Yeah, this is bro. Knowledge is
knowledge goes deep on this show.

2789
02:39:14,650 --> 02:39:16,930
We've been promoting bro
Science for four years,

2790
02:39:17,290 --> 02:39:22,290
but I'm pretty sure that they all that
passed in the law that anyone born after

2791
02:39:22,961 --> 02:39:25,780
the year 2000 can never buy cigarettes.
It's illegal.

2792
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:29,050
So it's out first
generation of non smokers.

2793
02:39:29,490 --> 02:39:32,610
I, I liked that and I don't like that at
the same time cause I don't like anybody

2794
02:39:32,611 --> 02:39:34,590
telling me what I can again of course.

2795
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:39,250
But I like it because kids are so god
damn easily tricked or we sparked by and

2796
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:42,750
those chemicals that they put in
cigarettes that make them more addictive.

2797
02:39:42,990 --> 02:39:46,980
Did you ever see that movie inside job?
Russell Crowe. He's your boy, right?

2798
02:39:47,010 --> 02:39:51,830
Russell Crowe has from the air is,
um, it's a great fucking movie man.

2799
02:39:51,970 --> 02:39:56,750
And it d it's a, it's a true story based
on a real chemist who the whistleblower,

2800
02:39:56,760 --> 02:39:58,290
right? Developing. Yeah.

2801
02:39:58,440 --> 02:40:03,200
Specific compounds designed to keep
people addicted and he details, uh,

2802
02:40:03,210 --> 02:40:07,410
the, the mechanism involved in these, uh,
addiction processes. And it's like, wow,

2803
02:40:07,500 --> 02:40:09,600
how the fuck did the government
let this shit get in there?

2804
02:40:09,870 --> 02:40:11,850
I have a lot of trouble quitting smoking.

2805
02:40:11,851 --> 02:40:15,270
I was smoking while I was fighting and
I got to the point where I was like,

2806
02:40:15,300 --> 02:40:18,360
I get sick a lot because you're
smoking and fighting. I was only 20.

2807
02:40:18,690 --> 02:40:23,520
You were smoking and finding say well that
isn't sacral Raba famous for that. Um,

2808
02:40:23,580 --> 02:40:27,210
yeah. I mean the thing about smoking
it, man, I wish I never started,

2809
02:40:27,540 --> 02:40:31,240
but I started when I was about 13 and I
thought it was cool. It was an idiot. And,

2810
02:40:31,241 --> 02:40:35,250
but, but tell him was 21. It
was still smoking. I couldn't
quit. I'm not dipping. Um,

2811
02:40:35,360 --> 02:40:40,080
or you got damp know he knows I
hate it meant I couldn't quit it.

2812
02:40:40,081 --> 02:40:41,490
And you know,
I got to the stage where I was like,

2813
02:40:41,491 --> 02:40:44,580
after either quit martial arts to quit
smoking and I couldn't quit smoking

2814
02:40:45,030 --> 02:40:48,210
because I was getting sick a lot
from my lungs and my sinuses.

2815
02:40:48,211 --> 02:40:51,120
So I'd go train and then
don't have a cigarette. Wow.

2816
02:40:51,130 --> 02:40:55,260
And it was so addictive and it was really
a scary thing. That's crazy. What time,

2817
02:40:55,261 --> 02:40:57,440
what kind did you smoke?
Normal cigarettes, you know,

2818
02:40:57,510 --> 02:40:59,340
I've never tried those American spirits.

2819
02:40:59,370 --> 02:41:03,480
They have a cigarettes that are all
natural. They don't have any additives.

2820
02:41:03,510 --> 02:41:07,230
We smoke. Look at me, we started as
teenagers, as stupid idiots and you know,

2821
02:41:07,231 --> 02:41:09,930
everyone just, that's what you did
socially when you'd meet up in smoke.

2822
02:41:09,931 --> 02:41:13,230
But I was actually one of the last ones
smoking and I felt really down on myself

2823
02:41:13,231 --> 02:41:16,060
really like week about
the fact I couldn't quit.

2824
02:41:16,190 --> 02:41:21,180
I quit when I was 22 which was like 11
years ago. But I haven't. But you know,

2825
02:41:21,181 --> 02:41:25,950
like I actually got to a stage where I
was that addicted to it that I couldn't,

2826
02:41:26,040 --> 02:41:29,130
I almost quit like
training cause I couldn't,

2827
02:41:29,131 --> 02:41:32,610
my health couldn't put up with physical
exercise and I'm not surprised, man.

2828
02:41:32,700 --> 02:41:36,060
That's tough. Will fuck you up. I
absolutely agree. It's a massive prize.

2829
02:41:36,061 --> 02:41:41,061
I everyone that I know that they'd had a
cigarette addiction and then quit still

2830
02:41:42,150 --> 02:41:45,690
longs for those. God Damn, I don't,
once I quit I quit. You know? Yeah.

2831
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:49,650
My friend Jeff. So this day he means he's
quit for more than a decade. He's like,

2832
02:41:49,651 --> 02:41:53,070
to this day, every now and then I'll see
someone smoking and just look so good.

2833
02:41:53,170 --> 02:41:55,270
I just want one punch them in the face.

2834
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:58,260
When I was in the casino and there's guys,

2835
02:41:58,320 --> 02:42:01,470
there's kids right next to a guy blowing
smoke and I mean I'm thinking like,

2836
02:42:01,471 --> 02:42:05,010
okay, well you just hit him with a
car, you know, like yeah, I, you know,

2837
02:42:05,310 --> 02:42:08,490
I have a real problem with that.
People just don't give a fuck about that.

2838
02:42:08,491 --> 02:42:10,110
That's a weird thing
about the cigarettes too,

2839
02:42:10,320 --> 02:42:14,100
is that it affects the people around
you and they don't give us farther.

2840
02:42:14,430 --> 02:42:18,070
Absolutely. It's also the thing that
they throw them on the ground. Yeah.

2841
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:22,200
Cigarette people are so likely to litter.
It's the weirdest thing.

2842
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:25,380
Like they don't have any problem with it.
It's like almost on,

2843
02:42:25,770 --> 02:42:29,430
on average more people that
smoked cigarettes litter
with those cigarettes and

2844
02:42:29,431 --> 02:42:30,000
anything.

2845
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:34,080
I had a guy over my fucking house that
was working on my house and he's sitting

2846
02:42:34,081 --> 02:42:37,320
out in my backyard and he smokes and then
he throws a cigarette on the gun and I

2847
02:42:37,321 --> 02:42:39,240
go,
what the fuck are you doing?

2848
02:42:39,630 --> 02:42:43,540
I mean you really littering in my fucking
backyard while you work. Dickhead.

2849
02:42:43,990 --> 02:42:47,970
Tradies just a Douche bag man suggest,

2850
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:50,070
but I couldn't believe it. He did
it right in front of me. I'm like,

2851
02:42:50,071 --> 02:42:53,340
what the fuck are you doing man?
I live here.

2852
02:42:53,341 --> 02:42:57,060
You're just going to throw shit on the
ground. Step on it. Oh, you stepped on it.

2853
02:42:57,061 --> 02:43:00,570
It's good. Now. It has gone. Someone tried
to tell me, oh, they're biodegradable.

2854
02:43:00,870 --> 02:43:05,100
Yeah. In a fucking hundred
years. In a hundred years,
it'll go back into the earth.

2855
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:08,280
You fucking nitwit or the daughters
at the beach. She's like, Hey Daddy,

2856
02:43:08,370 --> 02:43:11,710
look at this. Look what I found is either
a condom or a cigarette or degradable.

2857
02:43:11,711 --> 02:43:12,460
You fucking

2858
02:43:12,460 --> 02:43:16,960
Dildo just ruins a good base.
Biodegradable. What does it mean?

2859
02:43:16,980 --> 02:43:18,010
What are you talking about?

2860
02:43:18,011 --> 02:43:22,600
It's a foam fucking plastic filter at
the end of a shitty piece of paper.

2861
02:43:22,910 --> 02:43:23,090
Yeah.

2862
02:43:23,090 --> 02:43:26,350
Eventually the earth will absorb it so
you know what else is biodegradable your

2863
02:43:26,351 --> 02:43:30,220
fucking car. Leave your car for
a thousand years and won't exist.

2864
02:43:30,750 --> 02:43:32,490
Did you ever,
have you ever picked up?

2865
02:43:32,491 --> 02:43:34,860
I hate when people put them in
bottles and picked up a big,

2866
02:43:34,861 --> 02:43:37,300
all your thought was yours
and you're just like, oh,

2867
02:43:37,320 --> 02:43:41,370
that's the nastiest shit of all
fear.

2868
02:43:41,420 --> 02:43:42,690
It's cigarette ashes.

2869
02:43:44,280 --> 02:43:45,720
How about they throw
them out the window too?

2870
02:43:45,721 --> 02:43:50,070
That's a half the fires in California
from shitheads trailers throwing fucking

2871
02:43:50,071 --> 02:43:53,220
cigarettes out there and he'd do it
all the time. Driving on the highway.

2872
02:43:53,221 --> 02:43:56,730
Every day you will see some shit
head throw cigarette out the window.

2873
02:43:56,760 --> 02:43:59,460
They're not flicking it at you. They
don't think they're doing anything wrong.

2874
02:43:59,910 --> 02:44:00,800
I feel like it's,

2875
02:44:00,840 --> 02:44:04,860
they're doing something so bad to their
own body that they don't give a fuck.

2876
02:44:05,070 --> 02:44:06,860
They don't give a fuck about
poison their own bodies.

2877
02:44:06,870 --> 02:44:08,970
They don't give a fuck about
poisoning the earth itself.

2878
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:10,950
The worst thing is seeing
the people smoking.

2879
02:44:11,190 --> 02:44:14,210
We're going to wrap this thing up anyway.
The attention span, it's not really,

2880
02:44:14,460 --> 02:44:17,460
it's where at six o'clock already.
It's been a lot of fun, dude.

2881
02:44:17,880 --> 02:44:18,780
Three hour podcasts.

2882
02:44:18,950 --> 02:44:21,050
[inaudible] you got to
sick. Reznikov is today, but

2883
02:44:21,330 --> 02:44:24,120
no worries. It was great. It was
fun. No, it was fun. It was really,

2884
02:44:24,121 --> 02:44:27,810
I'm glad we did this. Yeah. Cool.
So, uh, your gym give people the, uh,

2885
02:44:27,811 --> 02:44:29,970
the w how did they get ahold of you?
What's the website?

2886
02:44:30,050 --> 02:44:34,340
Yeah, it's okay. So a, Jim's a ww w. Dot.

2887
02:44:34,430 --> 02:44:38,420
Vitti www 2014.
True.

2888
02:44:38,810 --> 02:44:41,240
What about http?
I don't think you need in that anymore.

2889
02:44:41,270 --> 02:44:44,570
I always got the slashes backwards.
But um, what's name, okay, no word.

2890
02:44:44,590 --> 02:44:49,430
Vt One academy. [inaudible] DOT com.
That's [inaudible] dot com. There you go.

2891
02:44:49,550 --> 02:44:52,790
There's the website on the left.
Just one quick thing.

2892
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,490
Do you know that a lot of French
girls in Canada called Lawrence?

2893
02:44:56,520 --> 02:44:58,190
That's really weird.
Last name or first,

2894
02:44:58,860 --> 02:45:03,200
cause I was on Tinder there that we found
their first name or the last name you

2895
02:45:03,201 --> 02:45:06,560
cycled back that big Chinese guy on
the left there. When I say Lawrence,

2896
02:45:06,561 --> 02:45:10,250
I think of a big giant ego with a
guillotine that kills you. Right Lawrence.

2897
02:45:10,270 --> 02:45:14,960
But on, on Tinder, all the girls were
Lawrence. That's so weird. Really Weird.

2898
02:45:14,990 --> 02:45:17,870
Tinder in the house and a random
note getting [inaudible] gone.

2899
02:45:18,140 --> 02:45:21,290
So that's us down there, come visit
us. We really friendly everything.

2900
02:45:21,470 --> 02:45:26,390
And the other side is peak peak-at-u.com.

2901
02:45:26,740 --> 02:45:29,400
Huh? Oh, other side is peak peak,

2902
02:45:29,610 --> 02:45:34,610
PW k Pwee k dash@eighty-u.com.

2903
02:45:36,441 --> 02:45:39,650
So why are you, what does that,
that's a, that's the project,

2904
02:45:39,651 --> 02:45:41,510
the growing down site
that we're working on.

2905
02:45:41,511 --> 02:45:44,390
We're going to put all like the stuff
at the talent stuff on and we've got the

2906
02:45:44,391 --> 02:45:48,440
psychologist, she's doing the podcast
on and stuff. So that's um, um,

2907
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:49,640
that's sal kind of sat.

2908
02:45:49,641 --> 02:45:52,010
We're just going to host everything
cause that's our business side obviously.

2909
02:45:52,280 --> 02:45:55,100
Okay. So just means to
find out what is it again?

2910
02:45:55,160 --> 02:46:00,160
It's so it's pick p p
e k Dash Dash Dash um,

2911
02:46:00,320 --> 02:46:04,040
you at 80 dash.
Why are you.com?

2912
02:46:04,710 --> 02:46:09,100
That's um, that's uh, that's not up
there yet. I'm just pointing at Joe. I'm,

2913
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:10,070
this

2914
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:13,430
is awkward. Okay. Alright. There we go.

2915
02:46:13,431 --> 02:46:17,300
That's the going down site and
that's going to have all the toilets.

2916
02:46:17,301 --> 02:46:20,800
So let's just going to have a lot of
projects growing down, growing downs,

2917
02:46:20,810 --> 02:46:22,670
a project we launched
because we were sick of,

2918
02:46:22,671 --> 02:46:27,380
I'm basically throwing up sick or growing
up or being at the dinner table and

2919
02:46:27,381 --> 02:46:30,650
everyone comes up tutors. So, uh, what
you're doing with yourself lately,

2920
02:46:30,651 --> 02:46:33,730
are you working hard? That's our
South African accent, right know.

2921
02:46:33,950 --> 02:46:37,760
So my friends are psychologists and he
just started getting pissed off and so he

2922
02:46:37,761 --> 02:46:39,380
coined this whole growing down thing,

2923
02:46:39,650 --> 02:46:43,280
which is about stop listening to other
people and start fucking listen to

2924
02:46:43,281 --> 02:46:47,240
yourself basically. Yeah, that's
a great idea. Cause by the way,

2925
02:46:47,241 --> 02:46:49,250
not only what other people
give you shitty advice,

2926
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:52,850
they will give you shitty advice because
they got shitty advice and they want

2927
02:46:52,851 --> 02:46:54,740
you to continue the
tradition of suffering.

2928
02:46:55,280 --> 02:46:59,900
People love watching people fail and
struggle because they've failed and

2929
02:46:59,901 --> 02:47:03,560
struggled. It's very rare that someone
would tell you, listen to me, I failed.

2930
02:47:03,561 --> 02:47:06,860
My life is a fucking disaster. Don't
do what I did. They don't do it.

2931
02:47:06,861 --> 02:47:09,650
Why don't you fucking grow up?
I've never heard anyone say that.

2932
02:47:09,890 --> 02:47:11,720
I've had many people tell me to grow up.

2933
02:47:11,721 --> 02:47:14,600
I've had many people that were fucking
miserable telling me that I needed to

2934
02:47:14,601 --> 02:47:18,650
grow up. I'm like, I don't get it. I'm
happy you're not and I need to grow up.

2935
02:47:18,680 --> 02:47:20,300
This is baffling.
Do you know you're gonna die?

2936
02:47:20,690 --> 02:47:23,810
I'm gonna die isn't the whole point.
Do enjoy this as much as possible.

2937
02:47:23,960 --> 02:47:27,050
I feel like I'm enjoying it
and I feel like you're not.

2938
02:47:27,051 --> 02:47:30,970
So I'm super confused as to why you're
giving me advice. One quick thing,

2939
02:47:30,971 --> 02:47:33,610
just before we wrap up,
I just wanted to share because I,

2940
02:47:33,620 --> 02:47:37,070
it just was something interesting that
came up were when we were backstage at

2941
02:47:37,071 --> 02:47:40,910
the UFC, right? And this is about
growing down and we're back there.

2942
02:47:40,911 --> 02:47:43,820
I'll fighters prepared pretty
well for the flight, right? Um,

2943
02:47:44,090 --> 02:47:47,030
and you go there and everybody's
telling you what to do. Don't eat bread,

2944
02:47:47,031 --> 02:47:50,660
don't eat this. Switch a potato or sweet
potato and everyone means well, right,

2945
02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:53,840
cut weight this way. Cut Weight
that way. Prepare this way.

2946
02:47:53,841 --> 02:47:56,910
Guys were holding pads hard as they
could the night before the fire.

2947
02:47:56,911 --> 02:47:57,650
Now we take it,

2948
02:47:57,650 --> 02:48:01,970
we taper a week before and we're there
and I'll fly to starts getting nervous.

2949
02:48:01,971 --> 02:48:04,760
You know when he starts copying a little
bit, because these are professionals,

2950
02:48:04,761 --> 02:48:07,080
right? Like we're professionals
too, but we study, you know,

2951
02:48:07,081 --> 02:48:10,190
we know what we're doing,
but he starts switching to sweet potato.

2952
02:48:10,191 --> 02:48:11,024
It cuts out bread.

2953
02:48:11,270 --> 02:48:13,940
He starts training a little bit
closer to the fight then he should be.

2954
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:18,110
And the thing was was like everybody
was telling everybody what to do and he

2955
02:48:18,111 --> 02:48:22,940
ended up dropping five pounds by mistake
because he changed everything that week.

2956
02:48:22,940 --> 02:48:23,720
And I was like,

2957
02:48:23,720 --> 02:48:27,080
I was thinking about for comedy for
fighting and all that stuff is like,

2958
02:48:27,081 --> 02:48:29,570
it's really fucking hard
to just trust that look,

2959
02:48:29,571 --> 02:48:31,280
I've in potatoes and
red meat my whole life.

2960
02:48:31,281 --> 02:48:33,080
Let's just keep doing it until the fight,
you know?

2961
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:35,120
And so that's what the
whole growing down it was.

2962
02:48:35,121 --> 02:48:38,630
It seems like if those guys are given
that advice and how to lose weight,

2963
02:48:38,631 --> 02:48:39,650
that seems like good advice.

2964
02:48:39,830 --> 02:48:42,080
Well he seems like the
[inaudible] wait till the last,

2965
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:46,040
it's probably because he probably
should be lighter in the first place.

2966
02:48:46,060 --> 02:48:49,670
I looked at it as a healthier diet.
The advice is right,

2967
02:48:50,060 --> 02:48:51,440
but the timing is wrong.

2968
02:48:52,060 --> 02:48:54,500
Like you're about to go up on stage
and some guy comes up, he goes, man,

2969
02:48:54,501 --> 02:48:58,520
before I go on stage, I usually go do a
quick shot. I like to kill her up my nose.

2970
02:48:59,090 --> 02:48:59,930
That works for me.

2971
02:49:00,170 --> 02:49:04,380
And then you go and do what you got
to station everything sniffling,

2972
02:49:04,390 --> 02:49:05,990
you're bleeding. So it was just, you know,

2973
02:49:05,991 --> 02:49:08,250
for all the Aussies coming
up is just have a confidence

2974
02:49:08,250 --> 02:49:11,160
in what you're doing is good.
Write notes and do it after the fight.

2975
02:49:11,680 --> 02:49:13,650
And that was just something we
learned backstage. You know?

2976
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:16,080
It's definitely good point
about tapering off, man.

2977
02:49:16,081 --> 02:49:19,250
That's one thing that people make a huge
mistake about [inaudible] they train

2978
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:22,290
too hard. They think it's good to
train hard the day before the fight,

2979
02:49:22,291 --> 02:49:24,720
but training breaks the body down.

2980
02:49:24,721 --> 02:49:27,480
The whole purpose of training
is to break the body down.

2981
02:49:27,780 --> 02:49:29,010
If you don't understand that,

2982
02:49:29,100 --> 02:49:31,980
then you need to talk to someone who's
an exercise physiologist and understand

2983
02:49:31,981 --> 02:49:36,570
what is the purpose of working
out, working out taxes, the
body. So the body heals.

2984
02:49:37,020 --> 02:49:38,760
Healing is what makes you stronger.

2985
02:49:38,940 --> 02:49:42,930
The breaking down of the body forces your
body to react to the fact that you're

2986
02:49:42,931 --> 02:49:46,470
making it do all this work. So he
goes, okay, we're lifting weights.

2987
02:49:46,471 --> 02:49:49,470
Now we got to get stronger because this
mother fucker wants us carrying heavy

2988
02:49:49,471 --> 02:49:53,040
things all the time. Okay, this
guy wants us running up hills. Boy,

2989
02:49:53,041 --> 02:49:55,890
we better increase our vo two Max
because we want to stay alive.

2990
02:49:56,040 --> 02:49:59,490
Obviously the body has different
requirements now we need more oxygen.

2991
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:03,360
But to break it down the week
of is really not beneficial.

2992
02:50:03,420 --> 02:50:05,880
You some guys do it though and they
get away with it. So I'll guide it,

2993
02:50:05,890 --> 02:50:09,490
looks at them and he goes, fuck this
is a pro. I better do it. It is. Well,

2994
02:50:09,540 --> 02:50:12,510
there's a lot of schools of thought.
I mean it's just like hard training.

2995
02:50:12,540 --> 02:50:12,751
You know,

2996
02:50:12,751 --> 02:50:15,510
there's a lot of schools of thought
when it comes to hard sparring and then

2997
02:50:15,511 --> 02:50:16,344
there's,
you know,

2998
02:50:16,350 --> 02:50:19,680
even pros like I was like Martin Kampmann
they say you should spar once a week

2999
02:50:19,681 --> 02:50:22,080
at most. Yeah, he's very good,

3000
02:50:22,110 --> 02:50:26,520
very smart and very technical but you
know a lot of guys didn't do it that way

3001
02:50:26,521 --> 02:50:28,500
and they have suffered because of it.

3002
02:50:28,530 --> 02:50:32,220
There's a lot of damage that
gets done that's unnecessary.

3003
02:50:32,221 --> 02:50:35,280
Whether it's in training, whether
it's a, you know, in preparation,

3004
02:50:35,281 --> 02:50:39,090
strength and conditioning, whatever it
is. There's a lot of unnecessary damage.

3005
02:50:39,091 --> 02:50:42,030
And what we were talking about
before about MMA training,

3006
02:50:42,031 --> 02:50:44,310
I think it's still in a learning period.

3007
02:50:44,311 --> 02:50:47,820
I think we still haven't got it down
the way. Like say football has it down,

3008
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:51,900
they know exactly how to train to
develop like top flight football players,

3009
02:50:52,170 --> 02:50:54,450
basketball, same thing. You
go to a basketball camp,

3010
02:50:54,451 --> 02:50:57,090
you're dealing with top flight
strength and conditioning coach.

3011
02:50:57,091 --> 02:50:59,850
They really know how to deal with,
I mean you're dealing with multi,

3012
02:50:59,851 --> 02:51:03,840
multimillion dollar athletes and they
have that investment and they want to keep

3013
02:51:03,841 --> 02:51:07,710
it healthy and really no one should
apply that more than MMA fighters because

3014
02:51:07,711 --> 02:51:09,570
who the fuck gets hurt
more than MMA fighter

3015
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:13,290
Whiteside? And Woodside probably is
the list taught sport in the world,

3016
02:51:13,291 --> 02:51:16,780
especially in Thailand because there is
no history of teaching. So it was like,

3017
02:51:17,130 --> 02:51:20,680
what is teaching fighters? They just
copied wise and loose pretty much.

3018
02:51:20,690 --> 02:51:23,240
So I was like, that's one of the most
backward sports in the world of them.

3019
02:51:23,241 --> 02:51:25,920
I never may. And there isn't a lot
of smoking and drinking as well.

3020
02:51:26,530 --> 02:51:30,870
I mean we had better now better.
They've gotten a lot of um,

3021
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:35,130
you know, fight against alcohol, fight
against drugs. This is a lot of promotion.

3022
02:51:35,131 --> 02:51:40,050
Now you've got a lot of guys like yachts
and Clive Fairtex and mallow pedal.

3023
02:51:40,051 --> 02:51:44,880
He's actually American, um, you know,
and balk out. And these guys are heroes.

3024
02:51:45,390 --> 02:51:49,860
So for people there's a lot more
pushed towards the be healthy,

3025
02:51:50,040 --> 02:51:52,650
get fit. You can make good
money now you can go to Japan,

3026
02:51:52,950 --> 02:51:54,990
you can fight in a very car dude dives.

3027
02:51:56,030 --> 02:51:56,220
Yeah.

3028
02:51:56,220 --> 02:51:59,240
I have friends that that trained in font
and Thailand and they were telling me

3029
02:51:59,241 --> 02:52:00,500
about everybody's smoking cigarettes.

3030
02:52:00,501 --> 02:52:03,830
And I have my friend Chris started smoking
when he was in Thailand because he's

3031
02:52:03,831 --> 02:52:06,100
fighting, he's fighting in
Thailand. Everybody was training

3032
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:08,800
and smoking and he started smoking too,
just like to be one of the gang.

3033
02:52:09,640 --> 02:52:13,640
Now he smoke cigarettes, you know,
share Champa cat, some grit, you know,

3034
02:52:13,641 --> 02:52:16,920
I've heard the name, he's the only like
Tom Post sort of base where we were.

3035
02:52:17,030 --> 02:52:20,320
Oh really? We broke a record. Rufus,
his leg. You've seen the fight,

3036
02:52:20,321 --> 02:52:24,500
I'm sure in other wineries. He puts
him and he breaks his leg the fall.

3037
02:52:24,501 --> 02:52:26,740
I didn't see that food drive. It's
on youtube. It's worth watching.

3038
02:52:26,741 --> 02:52:30,340
But we saw him and he's, I mean, he's a
legend for Andy Hug before all these guys.

3039
02:52:30,341 --> 02:52:33,580
Right. And we go to Thailand and Petaja
and he's just sitting there smoking.

3040
02:52:33,581 --> 02:52:37,390
So if I buy them a box of cigarettes,
he'll let me film him kicking the bag,

3041
02:52:38,140 --> 02:52:41,530
keeping a box of cigarettes, and he kicked
the bag for me. Show me the technique.

3042
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:45,790
Like they're just smoking and alcohol
over there's adequate control. Wow.

3043
02:52:46,440 --> 02:52:50,220
Last question before we go. Um,
I'm a big fan of a, of kickboxing,

3044
02:52:50,221 --> 02:52:53,330
obviously kickboxing's starting to make
its way into the United States, uh,

3045
02:52:53,340 --> 02:52:55,590
in a big way with Gloria Loris then yes,
on spike.

3046
02:52:55,980 --> 02:52:58,770
My only problem with it is
I don't like tournaments.

3047
02:52:59,100 --> 02:53:01,320
I don't like the idea of making
someone fight twice in the night.

3048
02:53:01,321 --> 02:53:05,280
And I definitely don't like them doing
it with like high level kickboxing.

3049
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:09,090
Like Nathan Corbett, um, fought,
uh, gold con sockets, right?

3050
02:53:09,120 --> 02:53:11,340
Go Con Saki knocked him
out in the first round.

3051
02:53:11,610 --> 02:53:15,720
Broke is a eardrum that stopped
the fight and then he had to,

3052
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:20,100
he had to go into the final round.
Go on. Saki did against Tyrone Spong.

3053
02:53:20,490 --> 02:53:22,890
We're Tyrone Spong
fought three hard rounds,

3054
02:53:22,900 --> 02:53:27,770
this young Brazilian kid and then fought
in the round and brokers, it's anger.

3055
02:53:27,870 --> 02:53:32,070
I don't think this Shin break came
from the fact that he had a fight three

3056
02:53:32,071 --> 02:53:33,660
rounds and coke on how to fight one,

3057
02:53:33,661 --> 02:53:37,740
but the idea that one guy could fight
one round and then the other guy could go

3058
02:53:37,741 --> 02:53:40,890
three rounds to go to war and
then they meet in the finals.

3059
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:45,480
I think that's fucking crazy and I think
in this day and age in 2014 with what

3060
02:53:45,481 --> 02:53:47,010
we know about concussed fighters,

3061
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:52,040
exact head injuries and then taking a
break and cooling down in between that

3062
02:53:52,441 --> 02:53:55,140
fight in having an hour in between
the first fight in the second,

3063
02:53:55,141 --> 02:53:56,190
I think it's fucking crazy.

3064
02:53:56,220 --> 02:54:01,020
But also the removal of Klich makes
it fucking desk elbows, no elbows,

3065
02:54:01,021 --> 02:54:04,140
no clinch won that fight
I think with Elvis.

3066
02:54:04,200 --> 02:54:06,710
Well he's a real moitai specialist.

3067
02:54:06,770 --> 02:54:09,990
I mean he is an elbow guy and they
took away one of his best weapons.

3068
02:54:10,020 --> 02:54:13,020
That's really the clinch and the
elbows to two of his best weapon.

3069
02:54:16,140 --> 02:54:17,400
The thing about Gloria though

3070
02:54:18,060 --> 02:54:21,480
for us is that it's getting
a house on a big scale,

3071
02:54:22,500 --> 02:54:26,410
which is good. Like in that
way. It's good. I understand
the tournament, like your,

3072
02:54:26,411 --> 02:54:29,550
your perspective,
the tournament's kind of agreeing away,

3073
02:54:29,970 --> 02:54:34,970
but to get striking with
competing against the UFC so hard.

3074
02:54:35,400 --> 02:54:39,570
Yeah, it's hard. Well, I
think that first of all,

3075
02:54:39,571 --> 02:54:43,250
there aren't spike, which is a huge
company, isn't know spike is Viacom.

3076
02:54:43,260 --> 02:54:47,720
They're owned by huge, huge,
huge billion dollar, you know,

3077
02:54:47,730 --> 02:54:50,260
backing behind them.
There's a shit load of money in,

3078
02:54:50,300 --> 02:54:52,440
in involved in spike and Viacom.

3079
02:54:52,650 --> 02:54:56,340
But I think that the tournament format
is dangerous. Yeah, I really do.

3080
02:54:56,370 --> 02:54:59,520
I think it's antiquated.
It's dangerous. I loved it.

3081
02:54:59,550 --> 02:55:02,970
That's why it's amazing to watch pride.
But I,

3082
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:06,740
for the athletes when you're dealing
with world class athletes like a Tyrone

3083
02:55:06,740 --> 02:55:10,070
Spong, Lego con Saki, I just think
it's unfair and I think it's fucking,

3084
02:55:10,130 --> 02:55:11,450
it's the wrong way.

3085
02:55:11,780 --> 02:55:16,250
I almost feel like it's disrespectful
to the sport itself and the fight is to

3086
02:55:16,251 --> 02:55:18,980
force worldclass fighters to fight
more than once in the night I think is

3087
02:55:18,981 --> 02:55:19,660
outrageous

3088
02:55:19,660 --> 02:55:22,780
because the thing that was going to
say just quickly about that is, um,

3089
02:55:22,850 --> 02:55:26,340
one of the biggest problems I think with
Gloria is it's also going to reduce the,

3090
02:55:26,350 --> 02:55:27,230
the um,

3091
02:55:28,100 --> 02:55:31,970
like might sign America is basically
kickboxing with knees and elbows, right?

3092
02:55:32,510 --> 02:55:36,770
The clinch in Thailand is like 30,
40% of Thai boxing,

3093
02:55:37,220 --> 02:55:40,270
not in America, not in Holland.
Right. So you're single,

3094
02:55:40,280 --> 02:55:41,950
these guys coming into MMA and not,
it is,

3095
02:55:41,960 --> 02:55:44,810
it can increase head damage
because there's no clinching,

3096
02:55:45,110 --> 02:55:48,200
but also the skillsets
that come from the clinch,

3097
02:55:48,201 --> 02:55:50,890
they don't exist in him and
a yeah. You know? Yeah. Like

3098
02:55:51,740 --> 02:55:54,890
we see it a little bit with Anderson
Silva. You see what a few more Thai guys,

3099
02:55:54,891 --> 02:55:56,990
they know how to clench.
And this sounds really stupid

3100
02:55:57,050 --> 02:55:59,060
cause you got a bad neck.
But I was saying like,

3101
02:55:59,240 --> 02:56:02,610
if you get to clinch with like a tired,
like I don't,

3102
02:56:02,630 --> 02:56:06,870
I'm trying to say it modestly, like
real clinch, like Thai clinch. It's,

3103
02:56:06,900 --> 02:56:09,560
it's almost like doing flowing Greco

3104
02:56:10,080 --> 02:56:13,860
body locks back. Takes snap
downs. What do you like lion fine.

3105
02:56:13,890 --> 02:56:16,100
Do you ever watch lion fight?
What's that line fighter?

3106
02:56:16,130 --> 02:56:19,500
An organization in Vegas and they're
putting it mal pet fights for them.

3107
02:56:20,450 --> 02:56:23,640
They have a lot of really
high level people that are
coming over from Europe and

3108
02:56:23,641 --> 02:56:26,090
fighting for them. They got really
good fights they're putting on right.

3109
02:56:26,550 --> 02:56:28,710
That was Cyborg Christina sidewalk.

3110
02:56:29,010 --> 02:56:31,890
She lost to this a girl from a hot on her,

3111
02:56:32,720 --> 02:56:35,100
she said to fucking Muay Thai fights.
They're,

3112
02:56:35,101 --> 02:56:37,650
they're hard on her because she took me
out hormones. That's the bottom line.

3113
02:56:37,910 --> 02:56:40,410
She's such a nice lady. The
reality, I'm sure she's a nice lady,

3114
02:56:40,411 --> 02:56:42,060
but the reality is she
took me out hormones.

3115
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:46,110
But you're saying they include clinch
clinches and elbows. Great. Yeah,

3116
02:56:46,111 --> 02:56:50,380
I mean they have it. It's a Kevin Ross
fights through them. They have, yes.

3117
02:56:50,960 --> 02:56:55,140
And you know, elbows clinch,
everything take downs. They, they,

3118
02:56:55,170 --> 02:56:57,960
they trip each other. They drop
each other. Yes. It is beautiful.

3119
02:56:57,961 --> 02:57:02,880
And it's the comprehensive full style of
[inaudible] and it's safer. It's better.

3120
02:57:03,300 --> 02:57:07,150
And it's also more lethal.
It's more effective. Elbows,
kicks, knees, everything.

3121
02:57:07,460 --> 02:57:09,120
What's um,
what's,

3122
02:57:09,570 --> 02:57:12,150
what's the premium card without
guy who fought not to even look,

3123
02:57:12,151 --> 02:57:14,910
he's got a long way to go. He's only,
you know, his first fight, right?

3124
02:57:15,390 --> 02:57:19,570
But he used more time where tie in the
clinch and like people were saying what,

3125
02:57:19,571 --> 02:57:22,380
what did he do there? And I was like,
that's like first day stuff in Thailand.

3126
02:57:23,060 --> 02:57:26,790
So I think Americans are robbing
themselves a bit by doing glory,

3127
02:57:26,791 --> 02:57:29,190
Not Moy, Thai, Thai. You know what I mean?

3128
02:57:29,250 --> 02:57:30,900
I couldn't agree more.
I couldn't agree more.

3129
02:57:30,901 --> 02:57:33,870
And I think we're on the same page as
far as the respect for the athletes,

3130
02:57:33,871 --> 02:57:37,530
making them fight more than once a night
against worldclass guys on an uneven

3131
02:57:37,531 --> 02:57:38,880
playing field.
Like you could have fought,

3132
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:43,050
like you could fight a worldclass guy
and get rocked a bunch of times in three

3133
02:57:43,051 --> 02:57:46,110
rounds and be really fucked up in that
dressing room when you're preparing for

3134
02:57:46,111 --> 02:57:50,190
the title and the other guy lands a
head kick 15 seconds into the fight and

3135
02:57:50,191 --> 02:57:52,860
you're both fighting in the finals
against each other. I think that's crazy.

3136
02:57:52,920 --> 02:57:55,770
I've absolutely and they're going to
have a big tournament in La and I'm going

3137
02:57:55,771 --> 02:57:59,700
to be there. We're going to watch it
every time. I watch it every time too.

3138
02:57:59,701 --> 02:58:02,860
I'm a big supporter of it. I just think
they should reconsider. I just think,

3139
02:58:03,050 --> 02:58:07,060
and I wish they would go moy Thai style,
just fucking bring in the elbows clench.

3140
02:58:07,510 --> 02:58:10,140
They'll watch some of those line fights.
They're doing it and it's very,

3141
02:58:10,141 --> 02:58:14,120
it's great. They have him on access
TV. Yeah. Right. Gentlemen, thank good.
