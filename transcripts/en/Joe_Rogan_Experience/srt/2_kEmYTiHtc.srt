1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,860
Three,
two,

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,610
one titles say right.
That's it.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,271
What's up,
Nina?

4
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:09,110
How are you?
Hi,

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,730
good to be here.
Thanks for doing this.

6
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:12,290
Appreciate it.
Good to be here.

7
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,210
That's a big fat surprise.

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,910
What's the big fat surprise
that better meet and t's do not cause

9
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:22,430
heart disease.
That saturated fat doesn't cause heart

10
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:25,250
disease.
That fat doesn't make you fat.

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,810
Low Fat Diet doesn't make you healthy.
That's my book.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,030
Yeah.
That's very controversial.

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,150
Pull this sucker up real close to you.
Alright,

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,063
there we go.
Right there.

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,170
Beautiful.
I'm very controversial in this day and

16
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,003
age.

17
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,860
It was even more controversial when the
book came out,

18
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:44,080
which isn't a 2014,
but you know,

19
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:44,914
we've seen,
uh,

20
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,040
an almost complete sea change on this
subject.

21
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,320
Not at the expert level,
but you know,

22
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:53,890
there's a real groundswell,
a in a change of thinking.

23
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,813
Um,
I think,

24
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,910
I think in part really triggered by my
book,

25
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,890
um,
which really laid out all the arguments

26
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:03,010
for how do we come to believe that
saturated fat is bad for health.

27
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:05,110
Why do we believe animal fats are bad?
Why do you believe?

28
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,850
Why do we believe they cause heart
disease?

29
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,120
Um,
and really tells that whole story of how

30
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:15,121
we started down this path,
believing that fat and cholesterol cause

31
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:16,780
heart disease,
make you sick,

32
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,820
caused cancer,
make you fat.

33
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,210
And um,
it's a wild story.

34
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:24,250
It's just an incredible story of the
politics,

35
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,100
the personalities.
It really is a story more about politics

36
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,300
than about science.

37
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,710
Did you feel vindicated when the New
York Times article came out where it

38
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:36,150
showed that the sugar industry had
bribed these scientists to lie about

39
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:40,080
data and falsified data that showed that
saturated fat was the cause of heart

40
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:43,050
disease instead of sugar?
Because that was fairly recently,

41
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,100
right?
It was after your book.

42
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,680
That was.
And you know,

43
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,840
that's a small part of the story.
I mean,

44
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,210
I have documents in my book,
there's,

45
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,590
there's maybe a hundred different
documents that you can find where

46
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,760
companies are trying to sway the
interest is they're trying to pay off

47
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:01,550
scientists basically.
There's so much money going into

48
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:02,780
nutrition science.
We really,

49
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,490
it's amazing how little people know
about how much nutrition science is

50
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:12,470
funded by the food industry.
And that was one small example where

51
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,650
Harvard scientists had received money
from the sugar industry.

52
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,390
And what the,
um,

53
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,250
this article contended is that,
that's what pushed them to blame fat and

54
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:25,940
not sugar for heart disease.
Actually don't believe that that's what

55
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:29,540
happened in that particular case for
those Harvard scientists in 19 fifties

56
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,580
because I studied them extensively,
you know,

57
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,730
for my book,
I read like,

58
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,240
well,
it took me nine years and I read like

59
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,250
10,000 scientific papers.

60
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,130
So I knew the work of those Harvard
scientists.

61
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,250
I knew everything they had written.
One of them is named mark hegsted,

62
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,760
who is very influential.
And the reality for him and his,

63
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,060
his colleagues was that they truly 100
percent believe that fat and saturated

64
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:55,610
fat and cholesterol caused heart
disease.

65
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,420
And they had believed it.
They had believed it for more than a

66
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,380
before the sugar industry came along
with that proposition for them.

67
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,760
They really believed those early
scientists were true.

68
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,320
Um,
they,

69
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,920
they were not corrupt.
They are,

70
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,830
they were actually not corrupted by
industry.

71
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:15,520
They were true believers.
And one of the things that my book

72
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:17,920
explorers is this phenomenon that
happens,

73
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,760
happened then happened today,
where scientists,

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,980
they come to fall in love with their
beliefs.

75
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,510
You know,
they fall in love with their own

76
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,470
hypothesis.
So

77
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,170
humans,
it's a problem with humans,

78
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,900
right?
So this is what we all do.

79
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,120
We all,
we fall in love with an idea,

80
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:36,810
we believe something and we only see
things that confirm it and we kind of

81
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:40,200
ignore everything that contradicts it.
Well in science,

82
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,940
what scientists are supposed to do,
what they're taught to do is to not

83
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,740
behave in a human way.
They're taught to rigorously distrust

84
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:52,770
their beliefs.
They're taught to try to find every way

85
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:56,430
to shoot down their own hypothesis.
That's the job of being a scientist.

86
00:03:56,431 --> 00:04:01,431
That's why they seem so cold and
dispassionate or show to us mere humans.

87
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,430
But in the case of nutrition science,
that didn't happen.

88
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,330
They fell in love with their idea.
It was like a favored child.

89
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,060
They,
all they did was try to find evidence to

90
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:14,520
support it.
They Cherry pick the evidence again and

91
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,910
again,
and they completely ignored or actively

92
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:22,290
even suppressed any information that
contradicted their ideas.

93
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,570
So this scientist,
mark hegsted at Harvard,

94
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,600
he and his favorite colleague Ancil
keys,

95
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,520
who is from the University of Minnesota,
they would actually bully and kind of

96
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:37,521
stomp on scientists who came up with
contradictory information.

97
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,560
They would actually suppress stuff.
They W,

98
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,320
and this is still going on today,
which is what makes it such an

99
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:46,590
interesting story.
I mean today,

100
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:48,540
it's the same phenomenon in nutrition
science.

101
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,690
This is the way nutrition science
started and it's,

102
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,530
it's the legacy that continues today,
which is that I any papers to the

103
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:56,820
contrary,
you know,

104
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:59,010
hard to get them published,
hard to get them into,

105
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,470
discussed,
hard to get them presented at expert

106
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,360
meetings.
Um,

107
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,590
and it's,
it's been driven by people who are

108
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,550
really married to their hypothesis about
what a healthy diet is.

109
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,210
So you feel like what happened was the
sugar industry came along and they found

110
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:19,660
these people that already had beliefs
that aligned with what they were trying

111
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:20,620
to sell.
Right?

112
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,640
So maybe they weren't even so neck or so
corrupt,

113
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,200
like maybe they've said,
oh,

114
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:30,040
well these scientists know more than us,
just pay them to get this research out.

115
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,500
He knew you can't blame industries for
trying to protect their products.

116
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,760
Right?
Every industry doesn't.

117
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,290
But I mean it's just what industry does.
And you know,

118
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,090
if there.
There was another story out recently

119
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:46,830
about how the sugar industry didn't
pursue research they had done that

120
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:49,080
seemed to show that sugar causes cancer.
Well,

121
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,540
I mean,
if you're the sugar industry,

122
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,820
like what is your obligation to keep
going?

123
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:54,870
I mean,
I'm not saying that,

124
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,980
you know,
they're new angels,

125
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,240
but we shouldn't expect corporations to
be angels.

126
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:01,400
What,
what you do expect is for your

127
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:04,880
scientists to behave in a principled
way,

128
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,530
right?
That's what we should expect.

129
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,360
Yeah.
I mean when it gets to a certain way,

130
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,990
I think if you look at cigarettes,
for instance,

131
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,690
in the debate industry,
like there's a large market for

132
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:18,370
something we know kills people.
I mean,

133
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:22,510
you don't have to lie about it.
You can have a warning on the label and

134
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:23,920
it still makes billions of dollars a
year.

135
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,821
Tell everybody,
hey,

136
00:06:24,821 --> 00:06:26,200
this is definitely going to give you
cancer.

137
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,850
Keep smoking it.
And they'll go,

138
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:29,260
okay.
And they'll buy it.

139
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,880
They'll keep buying it.
So it's not really that you need to lie

140
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:35,590
about things,
you really don't.

141
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,780
I mean,
people are more than willing,

142
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:42,100
as long as it hits the right buttons and
switches in their brain and their

143
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,290
receptors,
they're more than willing to put their

144
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,870
health in danger for some temporary
mouth.

145
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:47,704
Pleasure.

146
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,570
Yeah.
And this kind of goes to the subject

147
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:52,390
that is debated in the food world,
which is,

148
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:53,800
you know,
how much should the government be

149
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:55,680
telling people what to eat?
Right?

150
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,090
Right.
So there are people who think,

151
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:00,010
you know,
they believe sugars like tobacco,

152
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,540
if you eat it,
you will probably,

153
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,910
if you get a lot of sugar,
you are much more likely to get diabetes

154
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:07,870
and heart disease.
I mean,

155
00:07:07,871 --> 00:07:11,650
I think that even if you had a lot of
refined carbohydrates or maybe even if

156
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:13,630
you eat too many carbohydrates,
period,

157
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:16,150
you're more likely to get diabetes and
heart disease.

158
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:19,660
And become obese,
so you should,

159
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,130
but people like it.

160
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,940
And then there's also people that are on
a plant based diet,

161
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:27,760
like my friend Eddie,
who you just met is right before you,

162
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,110
uh,
who's a Vegan now he's been a Vegan,

163
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,120
I,
we say a couple of years,

164
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,490
three years,
I think you said he's waiting many

165
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:36,250
carbohydrates and he's admitting it and
talking about it,

166
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,850
not,
not exactly knowing how to fix his,

167
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:41,530
his cravings and urges,
you know,

168
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:43,690
if you're on a completely plant based
diet,

169
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,720
it's really hard to just go all fats and
get the proper amount of saturated and

170
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:51,940
unsaturated fats in your diet.

171
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,903
Yeah,
I mean,

172
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,430
so people aren't Vegan diets for many
reasons.

173
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,240
Um,
and,

174
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,630
and that's their own personal choice.
The reality is that,

175
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,880
um,
the,

176
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,670
you know,
there's a large body of rigorous

177
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:07,850
research by that I mean randomized
controlled clinical trials and thousands

178
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:12,590
of people showing that a diet higher in
fat and low in carbohydrates leads to

179
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,830
better outcomes in terms of diabetes,
obesity,

180
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:17,930
heart disease.
Those are the biggies,

181
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,260
right?
Uh,

182
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,360
and so lowering carbohydrates is the way
to reverse out of those diseases.

183
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,600
If you're on a Vegan diet,
it's just very hard to do that in a low

184
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:27,800
carb way,
you know,

185
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:30,530
what do you eat is your,
your source of protein and fat.

186
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,750
There's just,
there are some plant fats,

187
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:37,700
you can have a lot of coconut oil and a
lot of avocado,

188
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:39,020
but you know,
it just becomes hard.

189
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,540
Like what do you,
what do you put on your plate for dinner

190
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,140
every night?

191
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,460
You know,
like if you eat meat,

192
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,410
you have to meat.
I mean that used to be just at the

193
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:50,420
center of the dinner plate,
but it's,

194
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,820
it's hard on a Vegan Diet.
Other thing that's very hard to a Vegan

195
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:55,530
diet is staying.
You need to be really careful about

196
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,370
nutritional supplements.
Um,

197
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,160
and because you cannot get a,
get all the nutrients that you need

198
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,500
naturally from the foods that you're
eating.

199
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,540
And also some of those nutrients are not
as bio digestible,

200
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,150
meaning your body doesn't absorb them as
easily.

201
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:13,380
Like iron from spinach is not as
absorbable as iron from meat.

202
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,270
So.
So it's hard.

203
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:16,740
It's hard to stay healthy on that diet.

204
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,270
Yeah.
That is the big misconception right?

205
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:23,410
When you look at the total amount of
iron or protein or anything at a plant

206
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:26,870
based diet is the bio availability of
that people.

207
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,200
It's less and people don't understand
that.

208
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,960
So when people do like hold up charts
that show,

209
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:34,460
hey,
you can get a cup of Broccoli and that

210
00:09:34,461 --> 00:09:37,150
as the same amount of protein as a
cheeseburger.

211
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,500
Oh No,
it doesn't.

212
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,680
It really doesn't.
It might on paper.

213
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,840
But in terms of how your body absorbs
it,

214
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,823
it's not equal.

215
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,471
No.
All right.

216
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,880
You know,
another example is carrots.

217
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,300
I supposed to give you vitamin A,
right?

218
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:50,670
But carrots don't get.
They give you a precursor to vitamin a

219
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:53,450
called carotinoids.
Can it convert into vitamin a?

220
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,620
Not that efficiently.
Most people can't convert that

221
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:58,260
efficiently so they're not getting the
kind of vitamin a they need.

222
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,340
And what does vitamin A come from?

223
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,180
What food sources?
You know,

224
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,620
I don't know if top of my head and a
good source of vitamin C,

225
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,950
source animal.
Let's see.

226
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:11,810
I think you'd get it.
Pork Vitamin A.

227
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,730
I'm sorry,
I should know that,

228
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,530
but I.
But,

229
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,620
but you can get all the vitamins and
minerals and nutrients that you need

230
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,750
from animal foods,
um,

231
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,640
and you'd have to,
we'd have to eat this entire studio full

232
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:28,370
of spinach to get them out of iron that
you need and you can get that amount of

233
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:29,510
iron in,
in,

234
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,910
you know,
in a few ounces of meat.

235
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,000
So another one of the.
I'm sorry,

236
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,170
can you know,
the other thing is that in order to get

237
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:37,790
protein,
like if you can get your,

238
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,110
you can get your protein from being.
Say you have to have to get a complete

239
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:43,550
protein that's,
you have beans and rice,

240
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:46,010
but in order to get um,
you know,

241
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:50,150
let's say 100 grams of protein,
you need to eat like a thousand calories

242
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:53,870
of beans and rice versus say a couple
hundred calories of meat.

243
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,400
Okay.
So don't hold me to those numbers,

244
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:59,390
but I'm just telling you,
eat a lot more calories to get the same

245
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:00,224
amount of protein.

246
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,280
Yeah.
So for a day's worth of protein,

247
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:05,430
you're saying obviously wouldn't want
100 grams of protein in a single serving

248
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,350
preferred two days worth of protein.
Right?

249
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,550
You're probably gonna eat or an
exorbitant amount of beans and rice or

250
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:13,830
Broccoli or whatever the hell else are
trying to eat.

251
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,080
What are like iron is a big one,
right?

252
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:19,780
I know I have a few friends that are
Vegan or have been Vegan and that was a,

253
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:21,630
an issue with them was,
was iron.

254
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,190
Yeah.
I mean I was a vegetarian for over 25

255
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:30,191
years and I was always anemic and I take
iron pills and that didn't work.

256
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:31,431
And you just,
you know,

257
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:34,460
heme iron,
which is the favorite kind for

258
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:37,730
absorption,
is only available from animal sources.

259
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,790
And principally red meat.
White meat is chicken as relatively poor

260
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,050
in nutrients,
pouring iron too.

261
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,581
So,
you know,

262
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,700
the most nutrient dense food on the
planet is liver,

263
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,250
um,
which nobody is used to eating anymore

264
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,190
and we all think it's disgusting.
But

265
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,310
I like it too.
But you know,

266
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,090
know grandparents generation,
they had,

267
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,860
you know,
they had chopped liver or whatever.

268
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:02,140
They bring onions,
onions,

269
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,790
and that's very nutrient dense,
but we stopped eating it because it's

270
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,470
high in cholesterol.
So,

271
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,010
so these are the consequences of having.
What we did was,

272
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,480
this was my book is about,
but it's,

273
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:14,320
you know,
we started,

274
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:15,880
it started in 1961.

275
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,800
We basically,
the American Heart Association was the

276
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:22,630
first organization to say don't eat
saturated fat and cholesterol to avoid a

277
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:25,210
heart attack.
And that was based on,

278
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,950
at the time really weak evidence,
uh,

279
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,680
you know,
something called an observational study

280
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,110
can show an association but not
causation.

281
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,260
And um,
you know,

282
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:39,580
there were just enormous unintended
consequences at the time.

283
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:43,120
So actually this Harvard scientists
markets hegsted this was,

284
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:44,950
you know,
he was one of the people behind this and

285
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,600
he said,
we,

286
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,250
we imagined the benefits will be great
and we cannot imagine what the,

287
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,800
uh,
what the,

288
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,210
if they're in there,
that there could be any negative

289
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:56,890
consequences,
something like that.

290
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,700
And this is kind of the fundamental
tragedy of any kind of policy,

291
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,420
especially when it becomes enshrined by
an organization like powerful

292
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:09,340
organization,
like the American Heart Association or

293
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:12,240
say our government.
They do what they think they make,

294
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:14,470
kind of make a best guest and they can't
imagine.

295
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:16,630
What would the unintended consequences
be?

296
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,300
What would be the unintended
consequences of say,

297
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:22,150
limiting foods with cholesterol in them?
Well,

298
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,040
not eating liver,
not getting iron,

299
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,610
not getting all that meant eliminating
one of the most nutrient dense foods on

300
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:31,730
the planet from our diets and so many
other things.

301
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,700
As you know,
egg white omelets.

302
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,720
How many egg white Omelets have you?

303
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,140
Yeah,
I'm not into those.

304
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,500
They're real common.
As soon as I found out that there's a

305
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:44,220
lot of nutrition in the yolk and that's
like one of the healthiest parts of the

306
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:45,510
egg.
I was so confused.

307
00:13:45,511 --> 00:13:46,344
I was like,
what is,

308
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,590
what's the egg white thing?
Then why is everybody going with egg

309
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:49,870
white?

310
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,710
Because they're in the year.
So the yolk is where the cholesterol is.

311
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:58,450
So that's why we stopped,
stopped eating egg yolks and that's the

312
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:01,780
yolk is also where all the nutrients
are.

313
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,180
Like including things like Lutein and a,
which is for eye health,

314
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,520
brain development.
I mean there's all kinds of things and

315
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:11,670
things that are Coleen,
uh,

316
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,800
also for brain development that you can
really not easy to find.

317
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:17,380
You can't find them easily and plant
foods or at all.

318
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,900
And they're crucial to human
development.

319
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,360
So,
you know,

320
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,580
we eliminated these foods.
You know,

321
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:29,020
it's ironic like the cholesterol,
if cholesterol is essential to every

322
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,210
cell in your body,
we make cholesterol,

323
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:33,280
we eat cholesterol.
It's part of what,

324
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:33,890
you know,
isn't,

325
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,720
it's a building block for all of our
hormones and you know,

326
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:41,050
coupled with cholesterol or all the
nutrients needed to sustain life.

327
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,100
So we eliminated all those foods.
Um,

328
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,350
I notice that you're saying what you're
saying,

329
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:50,140
but most people when they hear that,
I'm like,

330
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,780
well,
no,

331
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,390
cholesterol is bad.
It gives you a heart attack.

332
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:57,800
My Dad is on cholesterol drugs.
He's on the statens to keep cholesterol

333
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:58,634
out of his body.

334
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,130
Yeah.
Well,

335
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,830
you know,
well,

336
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,520
it's been like 60 years of all of us,
you know,

337
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,090
all of us believing that fat and
cholesterol are bad for us.

338
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,100
Right?
Believing cholesterol is bad.

339
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,170
You know,
when I started this,

340
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,270
my whole,
this journey for me,

341
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,350
it was,
you know,

342
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:17,700
as I said,
vegetarian,

343
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:20,030
been vegetarian for decades,
um,

344
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,880
hadn't eaten a piece of red meat,
hadn't eaten raw butter for decades,

345
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,620
like barely eaten cheese.

346
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,150
I was for ideological reasons or health
reasons,

347
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,750
I,
I wanted to be thin,

348
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,910
like all girls.
I was like,

349
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,260
it started when I was um,
a,

350
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,370
like a late teenager and,
and of course I became fat.

351
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Like
I'm much thinner now as a middle aged

352
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,810
woman effortlessly than I was.
I was all through my young adult years.

353
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,890
I was like 25 pounds overweight,
but I just,

354
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,410
because I eat a high carb diet,
you know,

355
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,850
as a vegetarian,
you're like,

356
00:15:58,851 --> 00:15:59,780
okay,
don't eat them,

357
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:01,400
don't get you,
go to the mess,

358
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,260
you know,
the dining hall in college,

359
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,370
like,
don't eat the meat,

360
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,610
don't eat the cheese,
don't eat this and you have a salad and

361
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,050
then you're starving.
So then you're like,

362
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,400
okay,
get the bag of m and m's.

363
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,880
And that's what people do.
You know,

364
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,740
they're starving,
you're starving on that diet.

365
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,450
What is say shooting?
What is satiating?

366
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,160
Foods are protein and fat.
I mean,

367
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:23,360
that's actually been shown in scientific
experiments where they,

368
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,030
uh,
they put stacks of,

369
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:28,610
did one experiment,
they put it stacks of like pork chops in

370
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:30,730
front of people and they just said eat,
you know,

371
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,960
don't stop eating,
don't,

372
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,190
and,
and people just could not overeat on

373
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:34,921
that food.
You,

374
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:37,940
you fill up on fat and protein.
And they discovered that those

375
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,620
macronutrients are uniquely satiating.
Whereas carbohydrates,

376
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:45,050
you know,
overeating on cookies,

377
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:46,220
crackers,
trips,

378
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,110
pasta,
pasta box,

379
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,300
a whole box of cereal.
I mean,

380
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,070
you know,
in my vegetarian days I could,

381
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,320
I could eat a box of cereal,
no problem.

382
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,330
I'll eat a big bowl of pasta on the days
that I do cheat and even though I'm

383
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:00,460
stuffed,
I'll still keep eating.

384
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,010
I'll just see there's more left,
is more left.

385
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,450
No one's going to eat that.
I mean that.

386
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,420
I'll just put it in my bowl and just
keep eating.

387
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,080
Just your body craves it in some weird
way.

388
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,630
Well,
or alternatively,

389
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,640
like another physiological explanation
is that your body keeps eating because

390
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:20,780
it's,
it still hasn't gotten what it needs.

391
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,230
It hasn't gotten the,
the,

392
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,090
the nutrients that it actually needs
for,

393
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,250
to,
to build the cells to,

394
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:30,890
you know,
you're not giving it what it needs until

395
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:31,970
you eat the right foods.

396
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,540
Is it possible that both things are
going on that your,

397
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,210
your,
your body hasn't gotten what its needs,

398
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,220
what it needs.
So there's that craving,

399
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:44,221
but then there's also this incredibly
intoxicating carbohydrate thing going on

400
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,680
where as you're eating it in your just
your sugar levels are getting and you

401
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:49,980
just want to

402
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,590
keep going.
So what you're talking about I think is

403
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:56,940
a little bit more like the glucose
rollercoaster that happens and that is

404
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:59,520
part of carb addiction than the.
And what that is,

405
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:03,240
is you eat carbs,
really any kind of carbs because.

406
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:05,400
So I'm talking about bread,
pasta,

407
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:08,250
you know,
even healthy whole grain bread,

408
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,230
putting little air quotes around
healthy,

409
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,880
um,
and,

410
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,280
and,
and m and ms and snickers bars,

411
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:15,490
whatever,
whatever you want.

412
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,940
Any of those foods,
when you eat them,

413
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,610
they're converted in your blood into
glucose.

414
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,800
Okay?
Glucose is a simple sugar in your.

415
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,510
It goes around in your blood and,
and,

416
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,650
and it's like a quick fuel and your body
uses that up and then when it's gone you

417
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:31,920
want another hit.
Um,

418
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,430
and so that's the side,
that's the roller coaster.

419
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:37,740
So like you have cereal and Oj for
breakfast.

420
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:42,300
Oj is another just simple sugar and then
by mid morning you're starving,

421
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,283
right?

422
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,840
Whereas,
um,

423
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,040
I think maybe your listeners,
I think you've talked about this on your

424
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,080
program before,
but if you become what's called a fat

425
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:50,730
burner,
which is somebody who,

426
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,890
your primary fuel is not glucose.
It's fat with the fat in your body that

427
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:59,400
you store in your body and also the fat
that you eat,

428
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,920
right?
So you think about like a hybrid car.

429
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,650
You can have two fuel sources as a human
being.

430
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,680
You can either live on glucose or fat.
If you've got a healthy metabolism,

431
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:11,700
you can switch back and forth between
them.

432
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:12,990
Right?
So I'm,

433
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm,
uh,

434
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,890
I've trained my body to,
to be a fat burner,

435
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,360
right?
So I can live off of fat.

436
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:21,400
It's like I can be the electric car,
but when I,

437
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,720
you know,
when I eat carbs then I can switch over

438
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:26,850
to glucose,
but I'm healthy enough to switch back,

439
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,270
but unhealthy people who are unhealthy
and or just been living on carbs for

440
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:32,280
really long time,
mainly glucose,

441
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,420
they can only.

442
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,410
They can only get their fuel from
glucose and if they don't have glucose,

443
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:39,090
they just bonk.
That's why like you have,

444
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,000
you know,
long distance runners who are constantly

445
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:43,440
sticking down those,
those,

446
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,040
what are those called?
Those glucose packs and things.

447
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,070
They can't switch over to fat to burn
their own fat.

448
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,670
Eaton is an amazing thing,
like even an obese person.

449
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:57,000
Imagine I were like a 300 pound woman.
What are those?

450
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,960
What does that though all that fat on me
that is fuel.

451
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,020
That is like,
that is the miracle of,

452
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,670
of humans to be able to say it's like
having granola bars strapped all over my

453
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:09,504
body.
Right?

454
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,930
I should be able to access that fuel.
That's my fuel source.

455
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,650
Why do we have fat stores?
Becomes a burden.

456
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,710
It's becomes blocked and I can't access
it because I don't know,

457
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,660
my body doesn't know how to burn fat.
And that's what happens when you live

458
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:28,500
too long living off of glucose as your
only fuel source.

459
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,080
You cannot switch over and burning your
own fat.

460
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,170
It's like living on top of a well and
not having a bucket to,

461
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,300
to,
to get yourself a drink of water.

462
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,720
And then you,
you know,

463
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,960
and then you,
you,

464
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,170
you just,
you,

465
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:41,640
uh,
you die of thirst.

466
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,010
I mean,
that's a crazy way to look at the

467
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,860
granola bars dropped all over your body.
But I think that's a good analogy.

468
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,210
That's

469
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,160
why you have fat.
That's my all,

470
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,790
all animals or mammals have fat because,
you know,

471
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,380
what do you do when you're,
it's at night.

472
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,180
You don't,
you're not eating all night long.

473
00:20:57,181 --> 00:20:59,450
You have to have fat on your body,
right?

474
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,350
Know,
that's to live off of something.

475
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,900
And that's how humans.
And that's why,

476
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,650
uh,
you know,

477
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,560
humans became really good at,
um,

478
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,890
at storing fat because it meant we could
do other things.

479
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:14,610
We're not like chimpanzees who have to
eat all day long,

480
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:15,444
right?
Right.

481
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,680
Or like these people who are fruitarians
and like proud of living off of fruit.

482
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:24,681
They have to eat all day long to to have
like that's what they have to do all

483
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,140
day,
but we we nutrient dense food like we

484
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,800
meet that humans evolved to eat meat,
so that's nutrient dense so we don't

485
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:34,110
have to eat all day long,
so we have time on our hands.

486
00:21:34,111 --> 00:21:35,820
We have time in our hands,
do podcasts,

487
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,180
build the Taj Mahal,
do other stuff because we don't have to

488
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:41,460
eat all the time and we can live off of
our fat.

489
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,360
If we are eating well,

490
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,400
well the idea that you're all that,
that burdens you so where you're.

491
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,700
You have this gut or you have this fat
all over your body and depresses you.

492
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:53,510
That literally the change,
the point of view,

493
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,500
the perspective that,
look at that as fuel.

494
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,110
You literally have fuel hanging off your
body.

495
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,230
You just have to figure out a way to get
your body to access that and it will

496
00:22:01,231 --> 00:22:04,740
literally eat it away.
Did you ever see rob wolf was talking to

497
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,650
us about,
there was a study where they took a man

498
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:10,710
who is severely obese and they had him
fast,

499
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,890
nothing but water and some sort of
vitamins for 300 plus days and he wound

500
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:22,740
up losing not just all the fat,
but the crazy thing was his skin receded

501
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,410
as well,
and he didn't have the loose skin that

502
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,200
normally is associated with rapid weight
loss.

503
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,010
So when you get someone who's incredibly
obese and they shrink down to a normal

504
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:34,500
size person,
one of the things they have to deal with

505
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:38,730
routinely as these giant flops of skin
because your body's used to being so

506
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:40,140
big,
but apparently,

507
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:42,060
at least in this one case,
this guy,

508
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:46,710
as he had gone through this enormous
medically controlled fasting,

509
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,980
his skin shrank as well.
Like his body ate the fat and in,

510
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,500
in recognizes that in his body was
shrinking.

511
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,560
Everything sorta shrank up in
proportion.

512
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,550
Well,
that's amazing.

513
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,680
It is amazing.
I wonder if that could be replicated or

514
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:03,450
if he was just very uniquely,
uh,

515
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,720
had unique genetics or what the
circumstances were.

516
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,670
Some skin varies,
right?

517
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:11,250
That's why some people get stretch marks
if they just gain a little bit of weight

518
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:12,090
and other people don't.

519
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,950
Yeah,
I don't know.

520
00:23:13,951 --> 00:23:16,590
I mean,
I think that this is,

521
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,240
you know,
one of the theories behind intermit,

522
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:22,890
I mean dramatic fasting like that is
just for anybody thinking about it is,

523
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,470
you know,
that's potentially dangerous.

524
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,170
So it has to be medically supervised,
but you know,

525
00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:30,420
people,
there's intermittent fasting that people

526
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:32,920
do where they fast for a,
you know,

527
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,160
for like I do,
I never eat before noon.

528
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,570
So,
um,

529
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,320
and,
and,

530
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,020
and people do it for a little bit longer
periods of time and it sort of,

531
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,550
um,
induces a state.

532
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,940
What it does is it kickstart this
ability for your body to get into fat

533
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:51,350
burning mode and to stay in fat burning
mode.

534
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,760
And so,
you know,

535
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:57,260
what you want to do is you want to,
if you have excess fat on your body,

536
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,260
you want to,
you want to live off of that fat so

537
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:01,010
it'll disappear.

538
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,380
You want to,
instead of taking in food is your fuel

539
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:05,700
source.
You want to live off your fat until you,

540
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,570
you,
you,

541
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,570
you know,
until it's gone or the love of it is

542
00:24:09,571 --> 00:24:11,540
gone that you're happy.
So,

543
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:16,010
and that's what fat burners do.
And the way to do that is to keep carbs

544
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:20,120
low because carbohydrate moment,
you have glucose in your blood system,

545
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,060
your body prefers glucose.
It's a quick hit of fuel,

546
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,730
right?
Your Body will always prefer glucose and

547
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:28,010
once you have glucose circulating in
your blood,

548
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,440
it's like a,
it's like going up,

549
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:33,710
if it's like a being at a teller's
window in a bank,

550
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,910
it's like everything shuts down or like
you cannot get to your fat cells for

551
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,410
psych.
We're closed now.

552
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,570
You can't get to your fat as long as
you've got glucose,

553
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:45,020
that's what you're living off of.
So the longer your body to do that

554
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,010
because it prefers glucose,
glucose is your preferential fuel source

555
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,300
just is.

556
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,360
I don't know it because it was rare,
you know,

557
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,610
occasionally would come across honey or
it was,

558
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:56,830
um,
it's,

559
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,760
it was just,
it's a,

560
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,470
it's a quick,
efficient source of fuel.

561
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,100
Um,
so your body came to prefer to prefer

562
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:06,250
it.
But once you,

563
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:10,040
so you want to stay away from glucose in
order to access your fat,

564
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:13,730
that's just the reality.
And so fasting is partly doing that.

565
00:25:13,731 --> 00:25:15,380
You can do it for a little while,
you can do it,

566
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,630
you know,
just if you just fast in the mornings,

567
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:19,610
your body is basically fast at all night
long.

568
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,250
You fast through the morning and then
you have,

569
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,810
you've,
your,

570
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:25,520
your fat burning,
all that time.

571
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,160
Most people are not aware of that,
you know,

572
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,990
this is a relatively new situation.
Um,

573
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,360
uh,
I practice it.

574
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:36,050
I do intermittent fasting.
I do a,

575
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,500
I have a 14 hour window at night where I
don't eat.

576
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,460
And I think the more people do that,
the more they understand that your body

577
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:45,190
will burn off way more fat if you just
live like that.

578
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:47,800
If you just force yourself to only eat
inside of a 10 hour window.

579
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:51,720
Yeah.
So the key to that is you can't be

580
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:53,700
eating a lot.
You can't be on a high carb diet.

581
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,850
And then fast.
If you're used to eating a lot of carbs,

582
00:25:56,851 --> 00:26:00,990
your body will still preferentially need
those need that glucose.

583
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,150
And you'll still be on that roller
coaster glucose cycle.

584
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:05,150
So it's,
it's,

585
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,511
I,
I dunno,

586
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:10,170
I think it's pretty hard to do fasting
when you're in a high carb diet.

587
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,000
And you're right,
this is all pretty.

588
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:13,680
This is all new science.
So just to,

589
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,150
you know,
if you want to a little bit of

590
00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:16,650
perspective on this.
I'm

591
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,920
really all this science started in the
early two thousands,

592
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,780
um,
and it started.

593
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,120
So,
so the long history is so 1961 American

594
00:26:30,151 --> 00:26:33,630
heart association tells all of America
stop eating fat and cholesterol so you

595
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:35,100
don't die of a heart attack,
right?

596
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:39,260
That was heart disease had risen from
pretty much out of nowhere.

597
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,310
And in the early 19 hundreds become the
leading,

598
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,450
leading killer in America.
President Eisenhower himself is out of

599
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:47,370
the Oval Office for 10 days with a heart
attack.

600
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,870
I mean,
it's just a huge public health

601
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:51,450
emergency.
And this,

602
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,980
um,
ancil keys,

603
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,500
this a professor at University of
Minnesota,

604
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,960
he came up with this idea that he and
mark hegsted,

605
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:59,040
the one from Harvard,
said it was,

606
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,320
it was saturated fat and cholesterol
that causes heart disease.

607
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,800
And so that's,
that's when that whole hypothesis was

608
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:09,801
born and it became enshrined as policy.
The federal government gets on board in

609
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:12,990
1980 and that's the beginning of our
dietary guidelines.

610
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:17,991
So now the whole country is not only
avoiding saturated fat and cholesterol,

611
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,550
but also at this point,
all of fat suspects.

612
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,350
So it's like just cut back on all fat
and that was a different reason.

613
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:26,920
That's because fat is,
um,

614
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,380
is just denser.

615
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,010
Uh,
it has more calories per gram.

616
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:35,840
It has about nine calories per gram
versus protein and fat,

617
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,713
which have,
I'm sorry,

618
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,880
yes,
protein and carbohydrate,

619
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:41,280
which have about four or five calories
per gram.

620
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,630
So it was just thought prudent look,
one way to keep people thin is just to

621
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,720
keep their calories down.
And we can do this just by reducing fat

622
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:50,550
because fat is,
has more calorie dense.

623
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,030
So now we're all in the low fat diet and
we're avoiding saturated fat and

624
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:55,930
cholesterol and the,
you know,

625
00:27:55,931 --> 00:27:58,950
the government is enormously powerful.
And so,

626
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
um,
as I think,

627
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,210
you know,
and so it's not just that all Americans

628
00:28:03,211 --> 00:28:04,710
are given this diet,
right?

629
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,860
All Dr everybody,
every,

630
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,820
every health professional on the front
line,

631
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,840
every dietician,
every medical doctor,

632
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:14,970
every nutritionist is pushing this low
fat diet,

633
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,240
but all cattle across the country are
bred to be leaner.

634
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,250
The whole food supply changes,
right?

635
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,430
Food's all sorts of low fat foods appear
in the supermarkets.

636
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:29,090
Everything goes low fat and people
dramatically changed the way they eat.

637
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,400
I mean,
just to give you some numbers like we 34

638
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:37,401
percent less beef than we did in 1970.
We about 25 percent less red meat

639
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,340
overall wheat,
79 percent less whole milk.

640
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,050
Uh,
we,

641
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,310
you know,
we let,

642
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,790
I think about 19 percent less animal
fats altogether.

643
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,230
Eggs are down.
I mean everything,

644
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:52,500
all animal foods came down and we
dramatically increased grains.

645
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:55,290
We eat 30 percent more carbohydrates,
carbohydrates overall,

646
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:58,530
40 percent more grains,
almost 90 percent more vegetable oils.

647
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,491
These,
of course,

648
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:02,190
if you're not eating saturated fats,
you're eating polyunsaturated vegetable

649
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:05,790
oils.
So we had this huge change in the way

650
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:10,791
Americans eight and 1980 is also.
So that's the beginning of the dietary

651
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:13,020
guidelines for all Americans.

652
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,150
It's also the beginning of the obesity
epidemic.

653
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,290
You see,
obesity rates of obesity kind of very

654
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,660
slowly,
gradually going up until 1980 and then

655
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:25,770
they start the,
just take a sharp turn upwards and they

656
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:26,680
have,
you know,

657
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,130
barely.
I'm barely stopped.

658
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,050
So in the early two thousands,
uh,

659
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,500
what happened?
Well,

660
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,940
a journalist named Gary Taubes wrote
this front page,

661
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,820
New York Times magazine articles saying,
you know,

662
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,480
what,
if,

663
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,700
what if it's all been a big fat lie and
basically kind of revives the idea of

664
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:50,140
the Atkins Diet and says,
you know,

665
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:52,390
the Atkins high fat,
low carb,

666
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,720
he had been,
he had promoted his diet from the early

667
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:58,660
19 seventies on,
but he had really been vilified and

668
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:00,920
everybody thought he was a quack.
Um,

669
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,240
and at that point there really was no
science to support him.

670
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:04,961
I mean,
he would say,

671
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:05,590
but look,
I've,

672
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,090
you know,
I've healed all these people and look at

673
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:08,920
all my medical files,
go through my drawers,

674
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:09,550
look at my office.

675
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,383
And everyone would say,
you know,

676
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,580
that doesn't matter what,
there are no clinical trials,

677
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,700
there's no science behind your diet.
Um,

678
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,920
but Gary Taubes came out with this
article and then he came out with a book

679
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:26,490
in 2007 and a lot of people read his
work.

680
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,450
I mean even though he was vilified and
attacked and he,

681
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,320
but he was brave and a lot of scientists
read his work and a lot of scientists

682
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:35,940
who thought,
you know,

683
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,260
something is going wrong in America,
you know,

684
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:42,250
our obesity type two diabetes is up.
None of the explanations that we have

685
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:45,440
are working.
The low fat diets not working for it to

686
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,470
just rates continue to rise.
And so scientists typically not in the

687
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:56,260
field of nutrition because in the field
of nutrition it's considered heresy

688
00:30:56,261 --> 00:31:01,000
still to research the low carb diet.
Still a.

689
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,730
But scientists from different
disciplines started to do controlled

690
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:10,400
clinical trials on car reduction,
carbohydrate reduction,

691
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:13,030
the opposite of the low fat diet,
the opposite of what the government was

692
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:14,020
telling people to eat.

693
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,250
And so they're starting to develop this
body of clinical trial research.

694
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,660
And there are now nearly a hundred
randomized controlled clinical trials on

695
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:25,330
this low carb diet.
Um,

696
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,230
and they,
you know,

697
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:31,230
all kinds of different populations and
they really consistently show that it

698
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:36,190
not only helps people lose weight and
that was always known even the days of

699
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:38,200
rob of Atkins,
right?

700
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,780
But people always thought,
oh yeah,

701
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,410
I'll get my waistline,
but you know,

702
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,960
I'll pay for it with a heart attack down
the line and they're just kill my heart

703
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,030
because of the cholesterol.
But it turns out that the Diet is also

704
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:51,700
the best way to control your blood
glucose for diabetes.

705
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,350
It's,
it helps people.

706
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:56,710
There's actually an experiment out now
showing that it reverses diabetes.

707
00:31:56,711 --> 00:32:01,711
I mean completely eliminates that
supposedly incurable disease and that it

708
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:06,580
improves most of the risk factors for
heart disease.

709
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:10,840
So there's a lot of debate over which
risk factors best predict your

710
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:13,900
likelihood of getting a heart attack.
But you know,

711
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:16,720
for the ones that I think are the most
reliable,

712
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:19,780
including your triglycerides,
your hdl over your triglyceride ratio,

713
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:22,150
which we don't have to get into that.
But for the,

714
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,520
for,
for the most reliable,

715
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,740
uh,
heart disease risk factors that best

716
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:30,880
predict heart attacks,
the low carb diet also best improves

717
00:32:30,881 --> 00:32:35,881
those risk factors.
So what was it that made this so taboo

718
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,010
in the food industry

719
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,180
or the food research?
So like if health researchers today

720
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:47,180
wanted to research low carb diet,
and you're saying that it's taboo,

721
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:50,170
what's causing that with all of this
body of evidence that you discussed?

722
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,500
All these clinical trials is a,
obviously not just Gary Tobbs with so

723
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:56,960
many people have talked about this.
Dom D'agostino has done a lot of

724
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:58,910
research on it and it's,
it's very public.

725
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,970
A lot of people talked about this.
So with all that data,

726
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,620
where is the resistance coming from?

727
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,760
Well,
you know,

728
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,160
so if the low carb diet,
it works and is a healthier diet,

729
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,880
that means the government,
the government's diet,

730
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,840
the low fat diet is making people sick
and fat,

731
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,480
right?
So the entire establishment,

732
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,490
I see,
I'm not talking so not just the

733
00:33:23,491 --> 00:33:27,600
government,
but every university with all their

734
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:32,601
professors who have been endorsing this
diet and their entire careers.

735
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:36,210
Um,
all of pharmaceutical companies that

736
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:40,860
depend on lowering your cholesterol.
I mean there's a huge,

737
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,080
a huge set of interests that are
invested for any number of reasons for

738
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,910
keeping this establishment diet,
for,

739
00:33:50,911 --> 00:33:52,630
you know,
for not backing off this,

740
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,850
this diet that they have prescribed to
the American people for 50 years.

741
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,460
You know,
it's just a huge set of interest.

742
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,070
It's all the companies that benefit from
the Diet,

743
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,710
you know,
vegetable oil companies,

744
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,420
all the companies that produce all the
grains.

745
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:09,870
I mean 80 percent of things on
supermarket shelves are basically made

746
00:34:09,871 --> 00:34:13,740
out of vegetable oils and grains,
some formulation or another insult.

747
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,210
And so,
you know,

748
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:19,260
all those companies,
all the universities and then all their

749
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,100
new entire nutrition departments who've
been publishing for 30 years about the

750
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:27,370
benefits of this diet.
I'm the federal government and all the

751
00:34:27,371 --> 00:34:29,520
men,
the medical professional associations

752
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:32,190
who have been prescribing this diet to
their patients and their,

753
00:34:32,191 --> 00:34:33,450
you know,
their publics,

754
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,530
the American Heart Association.
I mean it's just,

755
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,290
we're in a situation where we just made
a gigantic mistake.

756
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,420
Wasn't there a recent,
very,

757
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:45,480
very controversial.
And I'm a,

758
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:52,410
not just controversial,
but very flawed piece by the American

759
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,200
Heart Association where they were
talking about the dangers of coconut

760
00:34:55,201 --> 00:35:00,201
oils and saturated fats and,
and all those researchers that have been

761
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:01,990
studying this stuff over the last
decade.

762
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:03,360
I'm like,
what are you talking about?

763
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:04,470
Like,
where's this coming from?

764
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:05,800
Well,
yeah,

765
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:07,750
I mean,
right now in the nutrition world,

766
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:12,751
you have people like me who are
challenging the status quo and you have

767
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,080
the sort of the conventional with the
defenders of the conventional wisdom,

768
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,010
uh,
you know,

769
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,330
doubling down to defend their position
is the position of the American or the

770
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,410
American heart association.
The American Heart Association launched

771
00:35:26,411 --> 00:35:29,890
this whole thing in 1961 right there at
the original authors.

772
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:35,200
So just last year they came out with the
presidential advisory unsaturated fats

773
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,431
were.
They said,

774
00:35:36,431 --> 00:35:40,560
please ignore all those confusing,
you know,

775
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,260
Internet crazies.
I mean,

776
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:45,750
basically referring to people like me
and Gary Taubes,

777
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,790
you know,
about saturated fats.

778
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:50,880
We just want to set the record straight
on saturated fats.

779
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,871
And,
you know,

780
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:56,460
here's our latest affirmation of our,
um,

781
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,490
our belief that saturated fats cause
heart disease.

782
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,630
So,
um,

783
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,040
I want to get too much into the weeds on
dol,

784
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,260
but you know,
they had the way that the American heart

785
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:11,940
association all these years has
sustained their position that saturated

786
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:16,941
fats cause heart disease is they have
relied purely on this week kind of

787
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:19,620
evidence called epidemiology.

788
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,360
Right.
Um,

789
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,640
and,
and the government knew that that was

790
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,650
not strong enough evidence.
So to explain what that means.

791
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,191
Yeah.
Okay.

792
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:30,600
So an epidemiology or these big studies
where they observe people,

793
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:34,470
they observe like tens of thousands of
people for a really long period of time

794
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,820
and they,
they asked them,

795
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,180
they just give these people a food
frequency questionnaire and they ask

796
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:39,451
you,
okay,

797
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:43,230
how many pairs did you read over the
last six months and how many prunes did

798
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:44,630
you eat and how much of this did you
eat?

799
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,110
How much of that?
And then you're supposed to write this

800
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:48,750
all down,
like as if any of us can remember what

801
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:52,920
we ate yesterday and you're supposed to
make accurate assessments about what

802
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:55,860
you've eaten on.
Like they asked 250,

803
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,430
the most famous one there just out of
Harvard as 250 questions about what

804
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:00,870
you've eaten over the past six months.

805
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,710
Now when they try to go and verify to
see if those food frequency

806
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:06,930
questionnaires are accurate,
they,

807
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,130
they,
they come up,

808
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:11,340
they basically,
it's very poor accuracy by their own

809
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:15,540
measures,
but still they use that data and then

810
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:18,150
they tie.
They follow these people over 10,

811
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:19,950
20,
30 years and they figure out who has a

812
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:21,120
heart attack,
who dies,

813
00:37:21,121 --> 00:37:23,460
who gets cancer,
and then they try to make these

814
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:24,660
correlations.
Oh,

815
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,320
you know,
the people who died tended to eat more

816
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:31,230
meat.
So they'll say it's meat that caused,

817
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,780
you know,
the what they can really only say if

818
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:35,700
there's a correlation there,
but it's not causation.

819
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:40,290
You could never establish causation,
which is to say that caused that death

820
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,470
problem is also that they're eating a
lot of things with that meat.

821
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,270
Right?
So carbohydrates.

822
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,631
Well,
yeah,

823
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:49,950
I mean like who eats red meat other than
an Paleo people now,

824
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:51,690
I mean,
who's been eating red meat for the last

825
00:37:51,691 --> 00:37:52,200
50 years?

826
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,710
The people who ignore everything their
doctor tells them,

827
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:57,930
right?
So not only eating more red meat,

828
00:37:57,931 --> 00:37:59,730
but they're eating a lot of other junk.
They're probably,

829
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,600
you know,
they're probably they,

830
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,230
and this has actually been shown,
they don't exercise as much.

831
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,303
They,
um,

832
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,190
they tend to not eat as well.
They don't visit their doctors,

833
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:09,390
they don't take their pills.
I mean,

834
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:11,400
they're not what we would call
compliers,

835
00:38:11,401 --> 00:38:13,710
right.
There are people who just do not listen

836
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:17,670
to the advice they're given and any
number of those things may have caused

837
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:19,440
the heart attack.
So we don't know if it's the meat.

838
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,290
We didn't know if it's the noncompliant.
We don't know if it's the lack of

839
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:23,760
exercise.
We didn't know if it's the fact that

840
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:24,540
they,
you know,

841
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,130
they drink too much beer,
whatever.

842
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:29,640
We just don't know.
So those kinds of studies,

843
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,310
these epidemiological studies are really
just,

844
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,080
they,
they only established associations and

845
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:40,000
way they were designed to suggest
hypotheses that could then actually be

846
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:40,834
tested.

847
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,050
And a kind of science called a clinical
trial where you actually,

848
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:44,950
you,
you,

849
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,860
you divide the group up into two parts
and you get like a drug trial,

850
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:51,460
you give half people to drug and half
people with placebo and only that kind

851
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:53,440
of experiment,
which is called a controlled experiment.

852
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:55,510
Can you actually establish cause and
effect.

853
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,140
So the way you want to,
if you really want to know meat causes

854
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,300
cancer,
you got to do a clinical trial,

855
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:05,620
give half people,
make them meet just red meat all day

856
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,480
long.
And the other half can be on the Vegan

857
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,190
Diet and see,
see who gets cancer,

858
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,470
see which group gets cancer.
Then you're testing,

859
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:14,680
you're doing actual test.
Um,

860
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:20,250
so the government just back to this idea
of sat unsaturated fat and then I'll get

861
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:25,540
back to that presidential advisory.
The government actually did do a whole

862
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:30,541
bunch of really big expensive randomized
controlled clinical trials on saturated

863
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:34,900
fat and cholesterol.
They did this on tens of thousands of

864
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,900
people and they they tested to see if
giving the people who ate saturated fat

865
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:45,130
and cholesterol more of that would die
faster or get a heart attack faster and

866
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:49,290
none of those clinical trials could
actually show that the people who ate

867
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:53,800
more saturated fat and cholesterol at
any higher rates of heart disease.

868
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,023
Music.

869
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,240
Is your phone ringing,
your phone going off with music?

870
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,080
I'm sorry.
I was trying to figure out what I

871
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:04,910
thought.
Maybe the Sonos was kicking off in the

872
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:08,310
background.
That's your phone musical ringer.

873
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,790
It's okay.
It was just slightly distracting.

874
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,410
So keep going,
please.

875
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,360
Do you want me to resay that?
Okay,

876
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:15,190
go ahead.
Sure.

877
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,010
Um,
so the government actually did a bunch

878
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:22,150
of randomized controlled clinical trials
on tens of thousands of people testing

879
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,150
to see if saturated fat and cholesterol
caused heart disease.

880
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:28,480
They actually took groups of people and
they did this in mental hospitals where

881
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:32,260
they totally control the people.
Eight and half the people that gave you

882
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:32,831
know,
meat,

883
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:34,150
butter,
cheese,

884
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,540
regular high saturated fat and
cholesterol diet and half the people,

885
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:41,440
they gave them soy filled cheese.
And margarine instead of butter,

886
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,380
and you know,
in soy filled meat and in those

887
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:49,270
randomized there's rigorous experiments
on tens of thousands of people they

888
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,410
could not show that the people eating
the meat and the butter and cheese died

889
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:55,410
faster of,
of,

890
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,710
of from heart disease,
died,

891
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,320
died at higher rates from heart disease.
In fact,

892
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:02,050
they showed in one of the most famous
experiments called the Minnesota

893
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:07,000
coronary survey.
This survey on on 9,000 men and women

894
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,690
over four and a half years,
they found the more the men lowered

895
00:41:12,691 --> 00:41:15,010
their cholesterol,
the more likely they were to die of a

896
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:17,920
heart attack.
So what happened to all those

897
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:21,280
experiments?
They were not.

898
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,460
That particular experiment wasn't
published for 16 years.

899
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,260
Other experiments I've found sat in Nih,
National Institute of Health Basement,

900
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:31,750
never published,
ignored,

901
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,310
not included in,
in literature,

902
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:37,670
reviews of that included,
just ignored or suppressed.

903
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,720
It's like out of a crime novel.
It's crazy.

904
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,870
It's.
And so what was the American Heart

905
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,570
Association doing?
Ignoring all those clinical trials.

906
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,900
So the American heart association is
basically just a,

907
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:56,080
almost protecting their incorrect
statements of the past.

908
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,930
That's what they're doing.
So,

909
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:02,470
right.
And so this latest presidential advisory

910
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:07,471
was their attempt because my book a
listed all these clinical trials and

911
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:13,630
Gary's book did earlier too,
but people have now been talking about

912
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,150
them a lot more in saying like,
how can you ignore that,

913
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:18,880
that we did all that.
We spent the government spent a billion

914
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,820
dollars more than a billion dollars
testing this hypothesis and could not,

915
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,580
could not show it to be true.
And why did you ignore these experiments

916
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:27,340
for all these years?
So,

917
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,120
um,
so the American presidential advisory

918
00:42:31,121 --> 00:42:36,121
was in an effort to reckon with those
long ignored clinical trials that had

919
00:42:36,401 --> 00:42:40,210
been funded by the government and they
did it in a way that I think was just

920
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:44,110
totally disingenuous.
And I wrote a response to it where I

921
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:46,290
kind of regretted it in,
um,

922
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,360
in medscape and asked,
wrote a piece in the La Times about it.

923
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:54,420
And um,
he knew we're at this point where the,

924
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,320
these,
these,

925
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,590
these esteemed public health
institutions are defending their long

926
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:04,990
standing yet erroneous positions about
healthy diet.

927
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,490
And then there's like,
people like me on the outside saying,

928
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,250
you know,
and,

929
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,340
and not just me,
you know,

930
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:15,280
there's now a whole course of scientists
around the world who are saying the same

931
00:43:15,281 --> 00:43:15,790
thing,
you know,

932
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,820
saying these recommendations are based
on flawed evidence.

933
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,650
Our guidelines are not evidenced based.
We need to,

934
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:23,590
you know,
our national guidelines are not based on

935
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:26,470
good evidence.
So there's this growing chorus around

936
00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:28,420
the world and,
and,

937
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,680
you know,
I'm one of the voices,

938
00:43:29,681 --> 00:43:32,020
I'm probably one of the more prominent
voices now,

939
00:43:32,021 --> 00:43:33,820
but um,
you know,

940
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:34,300
we,
we just,

941
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,870
we just have national guidance that's
just not based on good evidence.

942
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:41,090
There's that.
And then there's a lot of people that

943
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,120
get really confused by audiologically
based documentaries and things that are

944
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:48,780
trying to push people like what the
health and things along those lines.

945
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,260
They're trying to make some really
unsubstantiated correlations between

946
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,960
meat consumption in diabetes and a bunch
of other like really weird ones that

947
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,100
I've never heard before that I hear
repeated by people.

948
00:44:02,101 --> 00:44:02,431
I'm like,
wait,

949
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,610
where the fuck did you hear that?
And they'll tell me without doubt,

950
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,530
this one documentary,
what?

951
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:08,364
The health.
Yeah.

952
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,790
Yeah.
I wrote a rebuttal to that too,

953
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,830
which I'm happy to post if you want on
there.

954
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,381
And so,
okay.

955
00:44:14,381 --> 00:44:17,810
So that's a perfect example.
Like what was one of them was,

956
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:19,310
you know,
eating a,

957
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,220
eating an egg or two a day,
days like smoking five cigarettes,

958
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,020
like crazy stuff.
Right?

959
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:29,050
So all of that is based on that really
weak epidemiological evidence.

960
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,770
None of it has been either it's not been
tested in clinical trials or the

961
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:38,100
clinical trials that do not support
those statements.

962
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,610
I went through every single scientific
claim in that movie I did.

963
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,440
I was in Greece on a holiday.
And everybody's like,

964
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,700
why aren't you at the beach?
I'm like,

965
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,330
because I have to go through every
single scientific claim of what the

966
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:54,810
health and show that it's based on this
really weak,

967
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,570
unsubstantiated evidence.
And,

968
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:58,404
but you know,
these,

969
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:03,650
I think that one of the reasons that,
that they made that film was that,

970
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,190
um,
you know,

971
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:08,280
we live,
we live in very confusing times for

972
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:09,240
science,
right?

973
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,560
You,
you make a film,

974
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:13,040
you pull it somebody's heart
heartstrings,

975
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:13,831
you know,
it's very,

976
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:16,140
that's film is like,
it's very scary.

977
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:18,030
You feel like,
oh my God,

978
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:21,480
there's poison in the milk and now
there's poison in my pregnant belly and

979
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:22,650
it's going to be in my child.
I mean,

980
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:25,310
it's really effective as a piece of,
uh,

981
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:25,990
of,
uh,

982
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,600
as a movie.
But isn't it

983
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,510
not just irresponsible but dangerous?

984
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,110
Well,
I think so.

985
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,360
I mean,
but I think that what you have is people

986
00:45:34,361 --> 00:45:38,650
pushing this diet for ideological
reasons as you said,

987
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,410
you know,
they're,

988
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:41,770
they're the people behind that film or
you know,

989
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:45,100
two very,
very well known and a animal welfare

990
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,340
activists who just don't want animals
killed.

991
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,240
Um,
and you know,

992
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,890
those are their motivations and there
are other people who are,

993
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,520
um,
have faith.

994
00:45:55,610 --> 00:46:00,070
They have practices or kind of empires.
Like Dean ornish has a whole empire

995
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:02,440
based on his plant based Diet,
right?

996
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:05,290
There's just,
there's whole business commercial

997
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:09,040
empires that are based on this diet.
So the unit as a whole combination of

998
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:11,440
reasons.
Now there's a part of the,

999
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,330
you know,
in the environmental movement really

1000
00:46:13,331 --> 00:46:17,050
believes that cows cause global warming,
so there's like this whole confluence of

1001
00:46:17,051 --> 00:46:21,460
interests,
but if you just look at the health

1002
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:25,750
claims,
there are no randomized controlled

1003
00:46:25,751 --> 00:46:26,440
clinical trials.

1004
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,440
There's no rigorous evidence to show
that that diet is safe or,

1005
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,820
or you know,
or can fight disease.

1006
00:46:33,821 --> 00:46:35,350
And they've actually,
you know,

1007
00:46:35,351 --> 00:46:39,670
a few of these Vegan diet doctors have
actually done clinical trials and there

1008
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,560
was where they put people on a Vegan
Diet.

1009
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,071
Okay.
So,

1010
00:46:42,071 --> 00:46:44,230
and they were overseen by the Vegan
Diet,

1011
00:46:44,231 --> 00:46:46,600
Dr himself.
So as John Mcdougal did one of these,

1012
00:46:46,601 --> 00:46:48,490
he's,
he is here in California.

1013
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,680
So I mean the most biased possible
person overseeing this experiment,

1014
00:46:53,681 --> 00:46:55,750
right?
He wants his diet to look good.

1015
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,720
Um,
but even then he could,

1016
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:58,460
they,
those,

1017
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:03,460
those studies could not show that,
that the vegans were healthier at the

1018
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:07,390
end of a year of eating that diet.
So maybe it's a healthy diet,

1019
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:12,100
but it cannot be shown to be true.
And so it's fine to eat it for whatever

1020
00:47:12,101 --> 00:47:13,600
reason that you want to.
But,

1021
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,200
but health,
there's no evidence to show that that

1022
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,380
diet will be a good option for health.

1023
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:24,120
Yeah.
That is a very hard pill for a lot of

1024
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:29,070
people to swallow that for good reasons
don't want animals to suffer.

1025
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,140
Right?
So they want to live a life where they

1026
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:35,320
have a small footprint as possible and
don't harm things.

1027
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:38,860
One of the things that disturbs people
to no end is when I described the

1028
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:43,861
process of collecting green in a combine
and how vultures will circle over fields

1029
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:49,450
right after the combine rolls over
because those indiscriminate gigantic

1030
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:53,410
machines that might be a football field
wide or just chewing up everything in

1031
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:55,900
front of them,
including ground nesting birds and

1032
00:47:55,901 --> 00:48:00,901
squirrels and rodents and occasionally,
dear fons and anything else that gets

1033
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:01,930
caught up in the middle of it.

1034
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:03,711
Yeah.
I mean,

1035
00:48:03,711 --> 00:48:08,711
the reality is there is no life for any
creature without the death of another

1036
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:10,580
creature.
I mean,

1037
00:48:10,581 --> 00:48:11,810
there's,
there's,

1038
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,690
um,
life involves death of some kind or

1039
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:18,470
another.
I mean know monocropping agriculture is

1040
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,830
devastating to the,
to,

1041
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,550
to all kinds of life.

1042
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:27,450
It's also incredibly unnatural.
It's unnatural to see thousands of acres

1043
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,620
that are just soybeans.
Right?

1044
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:30,930
That is,
does very,

1045
00:48:30,931 --> 00:48:32,240
very weird.
It's not,

1046
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:35,940
it doesn't exist anywhere in the world
other than places where people have

1047
00:48:35,941 --> 00:48:37,560
forced that into the environment.

1048
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,990
Yeah.
And I think that there's also,

1049
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:43,360
you know,
a deep discomfort with the fact that,

1050
00:48:43,361 --> 00:48:44,710
you know,
for many people,

1051
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:49,690
um,
any sentience person that being human

1052
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:50,360
has,
you know,

1053
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,690
we were,
we evolved eating meat,

1054
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:53,590
right?
We're,

1055
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,350
we're,
we're not herbivores.

1056
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,850
Um,
and so,

1057
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,380
and,
and we can't really survive that way.

1058
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:02,020
In fact,
in the early experiments that they did

1059
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:04,240
on omnivore animals,
um,

1060
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,700
they did that,
them on all kinds of,

1061
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:08,470
um,
number animals in the 19 twenties and

1062
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:10,750
thirties.
And they tried to see if they could get

1063
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:14,080
an omnivore animal to survive purely on
plants,

1064
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,790
green seeds,
um,

1065
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,900
and they,
they found it incredibly difficult to

1066
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:21,000
keep those,
you know,

1067
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:25,030
whether a rats are pigs alive and even
when they could keep them alive,

1068
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,970
they live shorter lives and their
offspring live shorter lives.

1069
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,070
So,
you know,

1070
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,230
we,
we have,

1071
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:32,951
I think,
you know,

1072
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:35,260
we're,
we're ethical beings and so we have a

1073
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:39,340
discomfort with killing other animals as
well as we should.

1074
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,170
But um,
you know,

1075
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:46,120
that is why I think humans evolved all
kinds of ways of dealing with,

1076
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,440
with the need to kill animals basically
just to survive,

1077
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:51,303
right?
The,

1078
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:54,280
all the rituals,
the asking of forgiveness,

1079
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:57,100
the um,
and of course when it was your own

1080
00:49:57,101 --> 00:49:58,930
animals,
we all raised our own people,

1081
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:00,700
raised,
lived on farms and raised their own

1082
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:02,080
animals.
There were ways I,

1083
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:03,610
you know,
that it was a much more,

1084
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,060
sort of a part of the holistic
experience of being a farmer and living

1085
00:50:07,061 --> 00:50:09,070
on the land.
And now we're all so devoid live in

1086
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:12,280
cities.
We're thousands of miles away from,

1087
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,890
from where animals are raised.
We don't really understand anything

1088
00:50:14,891 --> 00:50:17,650
about it.
It seems inhumane and cruel.

1089
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:19,630
Getting a

1090
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:24,030
solution for this is probably going to
be this sort of laboratory created meet

1091
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:27,380
that seems to be a flourishing industry
right now.

1092
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,040
They're trying to get off the ground
with this stuff and it's very expensive

1093
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,660
at the moment,
but they foresee that in the next

1094
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:40,460
several years it'll be economically
feasible for people to buy meat from an

1095
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:43,160
animal that never really existed as a
living thing.

1096
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,740
You know,
if they can do that and it has all the

1097
00:50:46,741 --> 00:50:50,640
same nutrients that you,
that real animals do,

1098
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:52,110
that would be a miracle,
right?

1099
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,400
Yeah,
it would be.

1100
00:50:53,401 --> 00:50:57,300
It's gonna be very interesting,
but then there's also the issue of what

1101
00:50:57,301 --> 00:51:02,301
happens if we completely stopped eating
cows and chickens and pigs and what

1102
00:51:04,171 --> 00:51:07,800
happens to all those animals?
W W who manages that,

1103
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,540
who stops them from overbreeding,
who,

1104
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,320
who controls their population.
How do we do that?

1105
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:17,280
We've put ourselves into a corner here.
We've put ourselves into a corner.

1106
00:51:17,281 --> 00:51:19,890
If we choose to never eat these animals
again,

1107
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:24,360
how do we sustain their populations and
what financial,

1108
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:29,990
what financial reward do people get for
sustaining them?

1109
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:35,070
If they're not going to profit from them
whatsoever,

1110
00:51:35,071 --> 00:51:37,620
they're going to have to spend an
exorbitant amount of money or let them

1111
00:51:37,621 --> 00:51:39,330
roam free,
which people,

1112
00:51:39,331 --> 00:51:41,850
if people don't realize that's happening
in parts of the world,

1113
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:47,330
bowls revert to a very strange form,
a wild cows do in Australia.

1114
00:51:48,361 --> 00:51:49,830
They call them scrub bowls.

1115
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:50,791
I mean,
you know,

1116
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:55,791
they live in the scrubs and that these
scrub bowls are incredibly aggressive,

1117
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:59,090
enormous,
weird looking cow things that they now

1118
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,430
hunt and uh,
they have a problem with them in certain

1119
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:06,150
parts of Australia because they'll break
into these confined areas where they

1120
00:52:06,151 --> 00:52:10,740
have domestic cattle and screw up the
genes of these cattle with these wild

1121
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:13,860
cattle strains.
These bowls are incredibly aggressive

1122
00:52:13,861 --> 00:52:16,670
and they just roaming loose and you
know,

1123
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,740
is that what we're going to do,
can have wild cows everywhere.

1124
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:20,491
Like,
okay,

1125
00:52:20,491 --> 00:52:23,130
so what happens at the wild cow
populations get out of control.

1126
00:52:23,131 --> 00:52:24,870
We're going to bring in lions,
like,

1127
00:52:24,871 --> 00:52:25,704
what are we doing?

1128
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,431
I didn't know.
You know,

1129
00:52:26,431 --> 00:52:27,031
and there's,
you know,

1130
00:52:27,031 --> 00:52:28,530
this is something that I'm not an expert
in,

1131
00:52:28,531 --> 00:52:29,520
but I know people,
you know,

1132
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:33,420
there's a whole school of thought.
You really need large animals.

1133
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,081
Um,
you know,

1134
00:52:34,081 --> 00:52:37,650
they're part of a,
part of an ecosystem to have a healthy

1135
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,240
ecosystem on earth,
you know,

1136
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:44,241
you need animals as part of their,
they return manure to the earth and

1137
00:52:44,941 --> 00:52:47,010
that's part of the cycle of life and
that,

1138
00:52:47,011 --> 00:52:47,581
you know,
can't,

1139
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:51,150
plants can't survive without him and you
need animals actually to,

1140
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:51,840
uh,
as,

1141
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,540
as part of a healthy,
healthy environment.

1142
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:55,374
So,
you know,

1143
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:56,910
that's not something that I'm an expert
in it.

1144
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,080
Uh,
but I think it is,

1145
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:58,970
you know,
I,

1146
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:02,340
I guess I would say like the kind of
really simplistic,

1147
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,440
it's just simplistic thinking to say
that we should get rid of all animals

1148
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:07,861
or,
you know,

1149
00:53:07,861 --> 00:53:09,630
get rid of all domesticated animals.
Yes.

1150
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,830
I mean,
I just think that's,

1151
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:14,060
that's a kind of simplistic vision.
That's the

1152
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,250
dealing with simplistic versions,
right?

1153
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:19,700
We're dealing with an incredibly
complicated situation we find ourselves

1154
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:21,530
in,
in the 21st century that you didn't ask

1155
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,580
for it.
I didn't ask for it,

1156
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:24,680
this is just the place where we were
born and raised,

1157
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,390
so then we look around the landscape and
we go,

1158
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,510
okay,
what,

1159
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:32,700
what do I have to do for this meet
vehicle?

1160
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,880
What do I have to do to keep this thing
optimized and then what do I have to do

1161
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:40,881
for my mind that I don't feel terrible?
How about eating some horrifying factory

1162
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:45,830
farmed food or I have to watch some
video on how this thing was created and,

1163
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:47,940
and realize I'm a monster,
you know,

1164
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:51,240
and I think that is the motivation for a
lot of people to go towards veganism and

1165
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:53,580
I think it's a good motivation.
I think their,

1166
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:54,414
their,
their,

1167
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,950
their motivations are noble injust if
that's what they are,

1168
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:04,430
but somewhere along the way you get
roped into an ideology and you get boxed

1169
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:09,861
into these very rigid ways of thinking
and out of those rigid ways of thinking.

1170
00:54:10,111 --> 00:54:11,370
You get a documentary.
Like what?

1171
00:54:11,371 --> 00:54:12,204
The health.

1172
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,720
Yeah.
Well,

1173
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,290
you know,
I would also,

1174
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:21,340
I also think if we're in the same way
that we're a divided nation politically,

1175
00:54:21,621 --> 00:54:26,621
we are a divided nation in terms of the
way we think in urban city centers and

1176
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,060
you know,
where I've always lived my whole life,

1177
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:32,510
but um,
and out in the areas of the country,

1178
00:54:32,511 --> 00:54:35,030
you know,
the red states where they,

1179
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,150
they take,
they,

1180
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,360
they have cattle and they,
you know,

1181
00:54:38,361 --> 00:54:40,640
the dairy farms are and you know,
this is like,

1182
00:54:40,641 --> 00:54:43,100
we,
we actually have no idea for the most

1183
00:54:43,101 --> 00:54:44,480
part.
What goes on there.

1184
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:45,680
Um,
and you know,

1185
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:50,260
we just see like the horrifying videos
shot by some undercover person or I mean

1186
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,163
it's,
you know,

1187
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:55,290
one of the things that was sort of
surprising and,

1188
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:58,070
and,
and like a really beautiful experience

1189
00:54:58,071 --> 00:55:01,700
for me after my book came out was that I
was invited to speak all over the

1190
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:02,270
country.

1191
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:05,090
And you know,
I'm your classic flyover person.

1192
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,310
I grew up in Berkeley,
California.

1193
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,870
And then,
I mean,

1194
00:55:08,871 --> 00:55:10,400
then I lived various places in the
world.

1195
00:55:10,401 --> 00:55:12,530
But then I settled in New York City.
So,

1196
00:55:12,531 --> 00:55:15,260
you know,
I'm like as urban progressive liberal as

1197
00:55:15,261 --> 00:55:20,261
they come and all of a sudden I'm giving
speeches in Oklahoma and Texas and,

1198
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,400
you know,
Illinois,

1199
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:23,390
I mean really,
it was,

1200
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:29,870
it was really a shock to me,
but it was truly eye opening.

1201
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:32,120
Like I met all the people who,
you know,

1202
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:34,220
all these people in the cowboy hats were
like,

1203
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,353
oh,
I would've,

1204
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,940
I would've been one of the ones
protesting,

1205
00:55:37,941 --> 00:55:40,930
throwing Kale at these guys know in my
previous life.

1206
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:42,740
And No,
I'm,

1207
00:55:42,741 --> 00:55:44,810
you know,
standing in front of 800 of them talking

1208
00:55:44,811 --> 00:55:46,340
about saturated fat,
you know,

1209
00:55:46,341 --> 00:55:47,820
the findings in my book.
That's what I,

1210
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:50,680
you know,
here's what I've found and you know,

1211
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:53,840
I can't say that I did any kind of in
depth reporting but,

1212
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,890
but really the kinds of conversations
that they're having about how to best

1213
00:55:57,891 --> 00:56:01,100
take care of their animals,
how to treat them humanely,

1214
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,420
how to,
you know,

1215
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,340
how to,
um,

1216
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:08,210
how to raise fewer cattles and then
produce more.

1217
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:09,380
And I mean,
they're like,

1218
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,160
they were really just not the demons
that I thought they were.

1219
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:17,240
And I don't pretend to really know what
goes on in animal agriculture across the

1220
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:18,500
country,
but I just want to say like,

1221
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:23,501
it made me realize how in the same way
that we have this conversation going on

1222
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:27,010
now in the country,
um,

1223
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,630
politically the same,
you know,

1224
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,960
this is one issue where that plays out.
We have such a,

1225
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,510
we have such a lack of understanding and
comfort,

1226
00:56:34,511 --> 00:56:37,060
real conversation and understanding
between,

1227
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:39,070
um,
those have on the coasts and the people

1228
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:41,500
who are actually raising the food in the
middle of the country.

1229
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,173
So

1230
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,910
convenient.
And I do it too.

1231
00:56:44,911 --> 00:56:48,720
A lot of people demonize people that
live in places that they don't frequent.

1232
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,990
And it's really fun to poke fun at the
middle of the country and call them a

1233
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,120
bunch of dummies.
And Yeah,

1234
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,390
the reason why trump got elected,

1235
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,100
I think it's okay to do that.
You know,

1236
00:56:57,101 --> 00:56:58,770
I've noticed in like,
you know,

1237
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,790
my,
my colleagues,

1238
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:01,660
my,
you know,

1239
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:03,310
liberal journalists.
I mean,

1240
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:08,320
there's like the way the kind of digs
that they will take at rural white

1241
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:10,500
people is like,
you know,

1242
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,320
we,
if that was something about a person of

1243
00:57:14,321 --> 00:57:17,110
color or a woman,
I mean sure,

1244
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,020
that that person would be kicked out of
their job.

1245
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:21,820
I mean,
it's just amazing the level of a sort of

1246
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:26,080
the accepted kind of stereotyping that
goes on in the media towards these

1247
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:27,880
people who,
you know.

1248
00:57:27,881 --> 00:57:28,540
Again,
I,

1249
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,550
I,
that would have been me except that I

1250
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:31,750
just had this experience.

1251
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:37,470
Love to like pick your side and then do
you use any means necessary to attack

1252
00:57:38,491 --> 00:57:39,500
the other side?
I mean,

1253
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:42,750
you see this in an unreal,
not an unrelated way with the way they

1254
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:45,030
make fun of trump's hands.
Like you're,

1255
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,060
you're mocking this man's body.
Like he didn't do anything to have

1256
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,190
smaller or bigger hands.
Talk about his hair,

1257
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:52,740
talk about his ego,
talk about the preposterous way he

1258
00:57:52,741 --> 00:57:55,350
behaves,
but you're talking about his hands like

1259
00:57:55,351 --> 00:57:57,660
that.
You're just saying the gloves are off

1260
00:57:57,661 --> 00:58:01,110
and you could do anything you want and
you can just be a cruel person in body

1261
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:02,970
shame.
This guy for something he has absolutely

1262
00:58:02,971 --> 00:58:05,430
no control over.
There's plenty of things he's done wrong

1263
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:08,910
that you can make fun of,
but what about all the other people that

1264
00:58:08,911 --> 00:58:12,150
are reading about his tiny little hands
and they look down at their own tiny

1265
00:58:12,151 --> 00:58:13,830
little hands and they have to feel like
shit.

1266
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,940
You know?
I mean that's A.

1267
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,650
There's a a weird thing that people do.
It's very.

1268
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,600
And use that to tie it all together.
You really see that in the Vegan

1269
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:27,090
community.
There are a lot of vegans who are really

1270
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:29,370
kind people and then there's a lot of
vegans.

1271
00:58:29,371 --> 00:58:32,430
I always say that they're only reason
why they're vegans because scientology

1272
00:58:32,431 --> 00:58:35,460
didn't find them first.
These motherfuckers would have joined

1273
00:58:35,461 --> 00:58:37,380
the Taliban if they took the wrong
flight.

1274
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,590
They just.
They found a group and they went with it

1275
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:45,620
and now they are all in and you see that
with a lot of different ideologies,

1276
00:58:46,621 --> 00:58:51,621
but with vegans especially online,
they're so vicious and they,

1277
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,930
the.
The attacks are so ruthless and they

1278
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:57,840
gang up.
They get together and it's like part of

1279
00:58:57,841 --> 00:59:02,580
the fun of being on this gang is
attacking people that disagree and I

1280
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:04,350
know you've been the victim of this.

1281
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,460
Yeah,
I mean I think that um,

1282
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:10,560
you know,
I have,

1283
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,440
I,
I am sympathetic in the sense that

1284
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:18,900
people are so worried about their health
and there's so much conflicting

1285
00:59:18,901 --> 00:59:21,620
information out there and they don't
know how to make of it.

1286
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:24,320
And then there's a kind of.
And we eat,

1287
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,030
you know,
you have to eat two or three times a

1288
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:27,960
day.
So this thing is staring you in the

1289
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:32,030
face.
You cannot avoid it and then you find

1290
00:59:32,031 --> 00:59:37,031
something that you think is healthy and
good and pure and right and you want and

1291
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,220
it becomes an.
And to be a Vegan requires a lot of

1292
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:41,240
work.
Right?

1293
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,850
You have to.
I know because when I was a vegetarian I

1294
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:46,830
was like constantly chopping and dicing
and roasting and you know,

1295
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,370
it's like a lot of work.
It's a lot harder.

1296
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:53,420
I realized when I started eating meat
you could just put a piece of meat on

1297
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:54,710
the stove and that was it.

1298
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,860
I've become a very lazy cook,
um,

1299
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,820
but in any case it's,
it is.

1300
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,900
People would come very passionate about
their choices and especially a choice

1301
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:10,370
that involves consuming food which is so
personal and intimate.

1302
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,020
And then,
um,

1303
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,940
it's very hard to,
you know,

1304
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,570
to,
to acknowledge that that may not have

1305
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:20,120
been a good choice for you or for your
kids.

1306
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,160
Um,
and so,

1307
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:24,620
you know,
I think it's,

1308
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:26,601
but it's,
yeah,

1309
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:27,920
it's become a kind of idea.
I mean,

1310
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:29,420
one of the things that I think has
happened is that,

1311
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:31,610
you know,
we live in post ideological times,

1312
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:32,181
right?
I mean,

1313
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:35,120
you joke about scientology,
but we live in times where people are no

1314
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:40,121
longer members of when we're not as many
people are members of our religious

1315
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:44,690
right in any kind of traditional way.
And food is one thing that people become

1316
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:47,130
religious about.
They just do it.

1317
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,930
It's like a food type of thing.
It's a food movement and the food

1318
01:00:50,931 --> 01:00:54,080
movement,
I mean if you follow like Michael Pollan

1319
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:58,250
and Mark Bittman and they encourage you
to think about it as a movement,

1320
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:02,230
as something you can join,
be a part of being a community and

1321
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,480
it provides everything that,
you know,

1322
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,570
really didn't.
Religions did provide for people

1323
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,240
full,
but for the vegans,

1324
01:01:10,241 --> 01:01:15,241
what they do have on their side is that
they feel that their lifestyle is not

1325
01:01:15,401 --> 01:01:20,230
promoting animal cruelty and that gives
them the justification for attacking

1326
01:01:20,231 --> 01:01:21,064
someone like you.

1327
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:22,390
Right?
Because.

1328
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:23,771
Right.
Well,

1329
01:01:23,771 --> 01:01:25,540
you know,
I try to just stick to.

1330
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:30,660
I mean
I try to really stick to the science on

1331
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:35,410
what makes people healthy so you know,
if,

1332
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,570
if,
if you want to be a Vegan,

1333
01:01:37,571 --> 01:01:41,080
but if that diet comes with,
um,

1334
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:42,490
you know,
for most people,

1335
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:48,270
if it comes with diabetes and obesity or
ill health or the,

1336
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:51,010
or the failure to thrive if their
children or whatever.

1337
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:52,680
I mean that's their choice.
But you know,

1338
01:01:52,681 --> 01:01:55,240
you can't.
Well you can't say is that that diet has

1339
01:01:55,241 --> 01:01:58,600
any evidence to show that it provides
good health.

1340
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,390
Boy,
I think one thing that a Vegan diet does

1341
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:06,690
is it gets people off of the standard
American diet and the standard American

1342
01:02:06,941 --> 01:02:11,941
diet of just a bunch of bullshit French
fries and French fries can be Vegan,

1343
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:14,570
right?
But the,

1344
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:15,171
the,
you know,

1345
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:18,400
the processed food and things with a ton
of preservatives.

1346
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,430
You start eating a bunch of vegetables.
I mean,

1347
01:02:20,431 --> 01:02:22,190
you're going to probably feel a lot
better.

1348
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,150
We start eating actual real foods.

1349
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:27,060
Yeah.
Anybody who gets off of refined

1350
01:02:27,061 --> 01:02:29,010
carbohydrates and sugar,
it feels better.

1351
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,980
So that is definitely a step in the
right direction.

1352
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,090
I mean,
we can all agree on that and that's

1353
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:35,010
processed food,

1354
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:38,580
preservatives,
just eating nonsense and garbage and

1355
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:43,610
candy and just that kind of stuff.
If you can be conscious and proactive

1356
01:02:44,701 --> 01:02:49,230
about the healthy foods you choose and
just try to get as much healthy

1357
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:51,060
nutrients as you can,
you're going to feel better.

1358
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:55,410
But the question is what's the best way
to optimize your health?

1359
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,080
Yeah,
and just going back to this animal

1360
01:02:57,081 --> 01:02:59,600
experiments that I was telling me about
the 19 twenties and thirties,

1361
01:02:59,601 --> 01:03:02,240
you know,
what leads to long your long life in the

1362
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:04,790
long life and health of your children,
right?

1363
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:09,080
That's the way we used to think about
survival of health,

1364
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:12,230
fitness of an animal was how long did
you survive and how long do your,

1365
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,700
your offspring survive.
Right?

1366
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:14,910
And,
and that,

1367
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,810
that was the ultimate measure of,
that's always been the ultimate measure,

1368
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,480
evolutionarily.
So you know,

1369
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,473
if,
if,

1370
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:24,890
if a Vegan Diet were to support that,
that would,

1371
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:26,570
um,
that would be the optimal diet,

1372
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,760
but that,
that was just not what the science

1373
01:03:28,761 --> 01:03:31,310
showed.
So,

1374
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:31,821
you know,
I mean,

1375
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:34,550
there's also a whole kind of
evolutionary issue here,

1376
01:03:34,551 --> 01:03:37,310
which is you have to,
you have to bring in evolutionary

1377
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:38,780
science to understand and,
you know,

1378
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:40,190
how did humans evolve?

1379
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,260
I mean,
we're in a kind of ironic position where

1380
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:47,710
there's so many enlightened progressive
thinkers who are almost like,

1381
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:49,790
um,
you know,

1382
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:54,530
just deny her,
like denying our evolutionary history.

1383
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:56,070
Right?
Um,

1384
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:00,830
they're almost like creationists,
I mean our evolutionary history,

1385
01:04:00,831 --> 01:04:03,500
if you read,
if you read the science is about

1386
01:04:03,501 --> 01:04:06,260
evolving with meat,
that's just our reality.

1387
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:07,870
So we can't,
you know,

1388
01:04:07,871 --> 01:04:09,800
you can't really deny that and say,
you know,

1389
01:04:09,801 --> 01:04:13,070
we did not spring out of,
you know,

1390
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,400
out of the side of Athena or,
you know,

1391
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,243
whatever.
We,

1392
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:17,540
we,
we evolved.

1393
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:21,770
We evolved because we ate meat there.
Many evolutionary theorists who believe

1394
01:04:21,771 --> 01:04:24,080
we evolved only because we ate meat.

1395
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:26,160
Yeah,
the doubling of the human brain size,

1396
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:29,300
which one of the biggest mysteries in
the fossil record over a period of 2

1397
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:33,690
million years of human brain doubled.
And one of the primary ideas is that

1398
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:38,460
cooking meat and then figuring out a way
to hunt these animals made us stimulate

1399
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:41,130
our brains.
And there's a couple of other more

1400
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:43,750
outlandish theories.
One of them involving siliciden

1401
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:45,180
mushrooms,
it's pretty interesting.

1402
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,290
But,
um,

1403
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:48,450
it's called the stoned ape theory if you
want to look it up.

1404
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,480
But the,
the idea that we are herbivores and you

1405
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:59,250
hear this tossed around a lot and you'll
literally see like Vegan memes that show

1406
01:04:59,251 --> 01:05:03,030
our teeth versus a primates teeth or a
rather a,

1407
01:05:03,031 --> 01:05:05,610
uh,
a carnivores teeth and showing that we

1408
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:08,190
have teeth to grind up stuff.
But don't.

1409
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:11,460
These are teeth that have evolved for
people that eat cooked food,

1410
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,450
right?
I mean,

1411
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:14,280
this is where it's disingenuous.
Like,

1412
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:15,390
no,
first of all,

1413
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:16,800
we do have the teeth,
have an.

1414
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:19,450
And second of all,
we have the teeth,

1415
01:05:19,451 --> 01:05:21,640
have an omnivore that has been cooking
food.

1416
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:26,770
We don't need the same kind of teeth we
used to need to tear apart raw meat like

1417
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:29,830
we did 200,000 years ago whenever it
was,

1418
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,660
you know,
it's interesting.

1419
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,480
One of the things that I explore in my
book is the,

1420
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,390
um,
the way that meat has been valued

1421
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:42,391
through human history and it was valued
a bit as the food of warriors.

1422
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,800
Um,
and that,

1423
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,540
you know,
like the Maasai warriors who were

1424
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:50,590
studied by a biochemist data out of the
University of Vanderbilt in the late 19

1425
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,050
seventies called the Messiah Warriors in
Kenya.

1426
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:57,010
And they,
he found that they ate nothing but meat

1427
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,760
and blood and milk,
um,

1428
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:02,950
and that was the warrior class and that
was what was considered that made men

1429
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:06,520
strong.
The women were allowed a more diverse

1430
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:08,560
diet,
but the men who had to be strong and had

1431
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:13,561
to hunt,
they had this just purely meat in my

1432
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:15,550
diet.
Um,

1433
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:18,580
and,
and there's another interesting story

1434
01:06:18,581 --> 01:06:21,350
about how that same,
um,

1435
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:25,360
tribe was compared to they,
they actually had a kind of vegetarian

1436
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:26,440
tribe nearby.

1437
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,720
Um,
and that when they were both called,

1438
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:33,750
when both these tribes were called up
for the Boer war and the English tested

1439
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:37,300
their strength to see whom they could
hire to fight for them.

1440
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:38,770
Um,
and the,

1441
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:42,520
and the vegetarian men from this one
tribe that was,

1442
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:45,520
that this neighboring tried,
they had no strength.

1443
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:45,911
They,
you know,

1444
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:50,080
they tested them to see how that,
that device you use your hand to clench,

1445
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:53,020
see how strong they were.
They found them completely unfit and

1446
01:06:53,021 --> 01:06:55,030
unable to do work.
And they weren't strong.

1447
01:06:55,031 --> 01:06:57,790
They didn't have the same kind of muscle
mass literally.

1448
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:00,700
So they couldn't use the men from that
tribe.

1449
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,230
Um,
and then there's,

1450
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:04,720
you know,
there's just a rich history in

1451
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:09,340
literature about how meat was really the
food that made you strong and meet with

1452
01:07:09,341 --> 01:07:12,050
a food that was craved,
always craved that,

1453
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:15,010
that humans craved above all else

1454
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:17,880
would there have been vegan power
lifters and a bunch of different people

1455
01:07:17,881 --> 01:07:20,040
that have figured out how to do it
correctly today though,

1456
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:20,510
right?

1457
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:22,180
I think they may have,
but I didn't,

1458
01:07:22,181 --> 01:07:23,600
you know,
they must have taken a lot of

1459
01:07:23,601 --> 01:07:26,600
supplements and other kinds of soy
proteins or other,

1460
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:29,090
you know,
other things are you have to be.

1461
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:29,900
I mean,
there,

1462
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:33,260
there are,
there are replacements I guess in the

1463
01:07:33,261 --> 01:07:35,430
modern food supply,
but um,

1464
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,820
you know,
historically based on real foods

1465
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:42,410
available to humans for Millennia,
it was meat that was what was used to be

1466
01:07:42,411 --> 01:07:43,244
strong.

1467
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:46,160
Yeah.
And the dirty secret in the Vegan

1468
01:07:46,161 --> 01:07:50,420
bodybuilder community is steroids and
steroids were allow you to get away with

1469
01:07:50,421 --> 01:07:53,090
a lot of stuff.
And obviously that's the dirty secret

1470
01:07:53,091 --> 01:07:56,390
and all the body building communities,
but the Vegan ones,

1471
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:58,040
they want to just pretend everything.
Oh,

1472
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:00,590
look on a plant based Diet.
Look at my amazing body,

1473
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:02,030
sorta.
Yeah,

1474
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,310
you definitely.
Yeah,

1475
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,071
I mean,
yeah,

1476
01:08:04,071 --> 01:08:06,420
but that other stuff,
you know,

1477
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,020
I mean,
this is something that gets extremely

1478
01:08:09,021 --> 01:08:12,610
ignored where it's way more open and out
in the,

1479
01:08:12,611 --> 01:08:15,170
uh,
non Vegan bodybuilding community.

1480
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,230
Yeah.
Because I'm deep into the body,

1481
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:20,970
but I know you brought it up.
I know what you're saying.

1482
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,440
W,
w what have you,

1483
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:26,820
out of all this research and all this,
uh,

1484
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:28,570
analyzing this and the,
you know,

1485
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:30,500
the publishing of your book and the way
it's been received.

1486
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,710
How,
how has this changed the way you think

1487
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:38,740
about the way people approach,
not just diet but all sort of conflicts

1488
01:08:40,611 --> 01:08:41,444
in life?

1489
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:45,040
Oh,
that's a big question.

1490
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:47,740
I mean,
I'm,

1491
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:52,450
there are a couple of
major ways this profoundly,

1492
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,260
this whole research changed my thinking.
One.

1493
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:01,330
Um,
so one was really that I,

1494
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,930
it changed my thinking about,
uh,

1495
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:06,310
it changed my political views quite a
bit.

1496
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:07,380
Um,
I think you are,

1497
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,850
you're a libertarian or at least that's
what I was reading about you.

1498
01:09:09,851 --> 01:09:11,020
I was always,
I mean,

1499
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:14,100
I grew up in Berkeley and was a real,
um,

1500
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:18,460
like Liberal Democrat and still am on
most issues,

1501
01:09:18,461 --> 01:09:22,870
but you know,
here I found an issue where the

1502
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:27,871
government had started this program of
telling Americans how to eat and just

1503
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:33,120
made this huge giant mistake and this,
you know,

1504
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:37,840
spent hundreds and hundreds of billions
of dollars on this program that,

1505
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:41,500
you know,
we have quite a bit of evidence now I

1506
01:09:41,501 --> 01:09:45,670
think to make a pretty good case that
the government made America started the

1507
01:09:45,671 --> 01:09:49,600
obesity and diabetes epidemics and
continue and don't back down from their

1508
01:09:49,601 --> 01:09:51,880
recommendations even though they
continue to do this.

1509
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,650
And so,
you know,

1510
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,870
this is the one government program that
I have researched in great depth.

1511
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:02,440
I haven't really looked into too many
else in anything else in the kind of

1512
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,900
incredible level of detail that I have.
This one.

1513
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:09,901
And it made me,
I'm much more cautious about supporting

1514
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:15,250
big government programs.
I'm not because I don't believe in

1515
01:10:15,251 --> 01:10:16,240
government.
I do.

1516
01:10:16,241 --> 01:10:16,780
I mean,
I,

1517
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:19,390
I,
I believe that humans need to govern

1518
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,430
themselves wisely and it shouldn't just
be,

1519
01:10:21,431 --> 01:10:22,930
you know,
we shouldn't have government,

1520
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:27,931
but the potential to make mistakes,
the power of government to that once it,

1521
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:33,160
once it adopts a hypothesis or an idea
of some kind,

1522
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:38,250
and then the incredible institutional
entrenchment that happens when you adopt

1523
01:10:38,891 --> 01:10:40,120
a certain view,
right?

1524
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:45,210
And then it's so hard to reverse out of
that particular chosen line of thinking,

1525
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:48,050
it becomes almost impossible.
You know,

1526
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:50,020
this institutions are not built for
that.

1527
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:52,580
They're not really built for science.
You know,

1528
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:54,970
science is supposed to be,
as I said earlier,

1529
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:57,950
self-doubting self questioning of new
observations.

1530
01:10:57,951 --> 01:11:00,340
So you change your course.
That's what science is supposed to be

1531
01:11:00,341 --> 01:11:02,350
like you,
you test things and they don't work out

1532
01:11:02,351 --> 01:11:07,180
and then you move on to another idea.
But an institution is,

1533
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:09,810
is it's,
it's almost like institutional sciences

1534
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:14,100
click an oxymoron because an institution
is meant to not flip on their publics,

1535
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,380
not to change their views,
not to lose,

1536
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:18,810
not to allow people to lose faith in
them.

1537
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:21,540
So it's,
it's there,

1538
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:24,810
that's,
it's the wrong kind of body to do

1539
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:26,370
science.
Um,

1540
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:32,150
so it's made me much more,
a much more cautious about how much I

1541
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:34,760
want our government to do,
um,

1542
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:38,700
because if I have just turned over this
one little leaf and found this huge

1543
01:11:38,701 --> 01:11:40,590
disastrous program,
uh,

1544
01:11:40,591 --> 01:11:42,630
you know,
I just wonder if I'd turned over any

1545
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:43,464
other leaf.

1546
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:43,890
What,
uh,

1547
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:44,180
what,
uh,

1548
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:47,220
what else would I find?
I think you'd find similar in competence

1549
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:48,510
probably.
Yeah.

1550
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:50,010
So,
um,

1551
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,980
so it's changed my political thinking
quite a bit.

1552
01:11:53,090 --> 01:11:56,100
Um,
and then I think it's also,

1553
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:58,440
you know,
when I see the way that the scientific

1554
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:00,690
debate is played out and I,
and you know,

1555
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:03,600
I know the science so intimately now,
um,

1556
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:08,670
you know,
I know I've read every single nutrition

1557
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:12,180
experiment that has really been done
since the mid fifties.

1558
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:12,681
And,
you know,

1559
01:12:12,681 --> 01:12:14,910
when I see the way the debate plays out
in public,

1560
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:17,550
you know,
I see that a American heart association,

1561
01:12:17,551 --> 01:12:19,960
Presidential Advisory,
which I just see as a,

1562
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:20,510
you know,
it's,

1563
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:24,390
it's not honest science or our last
dietary guidelines,

1564
01:12:24,391 --> 01:12:26,950
expert committee in their report saying,
you know,

1565
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:28,700
we should,
um,

1566
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,630
we should all eat a plant based diet.
And I,

1567
01:12:30,631 --> 01:12:33,240
you know,
I can see how bad that science is.

1568
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,850
And so,
you know,

1569
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,920
I see that,
that I can see now so much better the,

1570
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,940
the,
the way that I'm PR firms,

1571
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:45,180
spin messages and the way those messages
are echoed all over and the way,

1572
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:46,500
you know,
it's just the way it's what's happening

1573
01:12:46,501 --> 01:12:47,450
in our politics.
It's,

1574
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:49,500
it's happening in our science.
Um,

1575
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:54,540
and,
and so I think it makes me somewhat

1576
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:59,460
despair about our ability to have good
science rise to the top.

1577
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,100
Because,
you know,

1578
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:03,000
when you have institutions like Harvard
and tufts and you know,

1579
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:06,420
all of our top institutions are so
deeply invested in this wrong

1580
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:07,690
hypothesis.
Yet I don't even know.

1581
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:10,530
I don't know where people should turn
to,

1582
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:11,371
to,
you know,

1583
01:13:11,371 --> 01:13:13,200
how,
how do we sort ourselves out of this

1584
01:13:13,201 --> 01:13:15,360
mess?
Um,

1585
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,450
so yeah,
nutrition science is in bad shape and I,

1586
01:13:18,451 --> 01:13:19,860
and it,
it changed my,

1587
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:24,360
it's changed my faith in expert advice.
Maybe that's the bottom line.

1588
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:28,500
I really don't trust expert advice
because I see the way it is manipulated,

1589
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:32,940
um,
by financial interests and professional

1590
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:36,180
interests and intellectual conflicts of
interest.

1591
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,100
And so,
you know,

1592
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:41,460
even little tiny things like anything,
a warning label on a bottle,

1593
01:13:41,461 --> 01:13:42,294
like,
you know,

1594
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:45,060
careful of this plastic or this or that.
I'm like,

1595
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,240
I don't believe anything unless I go
back to their original science and read

1596
01:13:48,241 --> 01:13:50,250
it all myself,
which I can never do.

1597
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:51,990
I just don't trust anything anymore.

1598
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,220
That's not a good place to be.
It isn't.

1599
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,190
I need to spend time in your isolation
tank

1600
01:13:58,780 --> 01:13:59,980
boy.
And with that,

1601
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:02,050
um,
if people want to find out more,

1602
01:14:02,051 --> 01:14:04,300
your book,
a big fat surprise.

1603
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,373
What else?

1604
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:08,200
So my book is called the big fat
surprise.

1605
01:14:08,201 --> 01:14:13,201
It's available on Amazon.
I have my website is [inaudible] dot

1606
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:15,130
com,
which is,

1607
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,950
you'll never be able to spell,
but if you look up the big fat surprise,

1608
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:22,970
you'll get to Nina titles and um,
and I also started a group called the

1609
01:14:23,021 --> 01:14:27,910
nutrition coalition,
which is nutrition coalition dot u s

1610
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:33,420
that is a group that is backed by
scientists,

1611
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,140
phds,
mds.

1612
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,780
The odd journalists like me.
Um,

1613
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:42,220
we are basically the work of that group
is to try to ensure that our nutrition

1614
01:14:42,221 --> 01:14:44,260
policy is evidenced based,
right?

1615
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:47,480
Trying to unearth that,
suppress the science,

1616
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:49,960
get those studies out of the nih
basement,

1617
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:51,990
that kind of thing.
Just to ensure that whatever the,

1618
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,950
if the government is going to tell
Americans what to eat,

1619
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,950
it needs to be evidenced based.
Um,

1620
01:14:56,951 --> 01:15:00,580
so we're doing work in Washington and
um,

1621
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:03,340
and you can read about,
I mean it's not just on fat and

1622
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:05,770
carbohydrates that I've got.
They've got it wrong on Salt,

1623
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:09,370
you know,
the advice to get aerobic exercise for

1624
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:13,030
45 to minutes to an hour every day.
None of that is based on good science.

1625
01:15:13,031 --> 01:15:17,830
So we just want the,
the goal of this group is to work

1626
01:15:17,831 --> 01:15:21,520
towards evidence based policy in
nutrition

1627
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:24,570
two.
So please talk a little bit more about

1628
01:15:24,571 --> 01:15:26,700
salt because that's one that comes up
all the time with people.

1629
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:28,230
They want to tell me that salt's bad for
you.

1630
01:15:28,231 --> 01:15:29,270
I'm like,
goddammit,

1631
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:31,530
salt is an essential nutrient.
You'll die without it.

1632
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:32,250
So

1633
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:36,240
the short story and salt is that they
did a bunch of clinical trials only on

1634
01:15:36,241 --> 01:15:40,770
hypertensive subjects.
So anybody that were already sick,

1635
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,300
okay.
So if you're a normal person,

1636
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:45,150
if you're child,
if you're a you,

1637
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:48,270
none of this applies to you should never
have been generalized to a larger

1638
01:15:48,271 --> 01:15:50,580
population.
They were called the Dash Studies.

1639
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,490
None of these studies were longer than
two months,

1640
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:58,500
which is super short for clinical trial.
And what they showed was that for people

1641
01:15:58,501 --> 01:16:02,760
who already had hypertension and eight,
a lot of salt,

1642
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,610
the,
for those people reducing their salt

1643
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:07,890
improved their,
um,

1644
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,940
their cardiovascular risk factors.
They didn't follow any of these people

1645
01:16:11,941 --> 01:16:15,300
long enough to figure out who actually
had heart attack or died.

1646
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:17,070
They're very,
very short term,

1647
01:16:17,071 --> 01:16:19,920
small experiments.
They never tested more than 2000 people

1648
01:16:19,921 --> 01:16:20,940
on them.
This,

1649
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:23,190
this whole dash died,
this reduced sodium diet.

1650
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:26,250
None of that advice should be
generalized to anybody else.

1651
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:32,060
And there have now been for large
studies where they,

1652
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:35,130
um,
their epidemiological studies so that

1653
01:16:35,131 --> 01:16:36,510
they're not,
that's only associations,

1654
01:16:36,511 --> 01:16:38,370
but the important thing about it is that
there's,

1655
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:43,430
they contradict this salt advice.
They show that really if you go too low,

1656
01:16:43,950 --> 01:16:47,490
people who consumed too little salt,
those people,

1657
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,410
uh,
have higher rates,

1658
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:54,560
higher rates of cardiovascular death,
so that there seems to be a sweet spot

1659
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,310
for consuming salt starts the,
it's sort of aj shaped curve.

1660
01:16:59,311 --> 01:17:04,311
So if you have moderate consumption of
salt for the general population is a,

1661
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:07,530
is,
is sort of the sweet spot for,

1662
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:12,710
for a good and cardiovascular health.
So and so,

1663
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:14,870
you know,
the government's advice is lower is

1664
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:18,340
better for all Americans and that's just
not based on any good,

1665
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:21,320
any rigorous science at all.
Boom,

1666
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:24,200
boom.
So our group is working to try to change

1667
01:17:24,201 --> 01:17:24,831
that,
you know,

1668
01:17:24,831 --> 01:17:26,120
it just has to change

1669
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:29,820
without people like you.
People like me would be completely lost.

1670
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:31,950
So thank you so much for all your
research.

1671
01:17:31,951 --> 01:17:33,960
Thank you for your book.
Thank you for your time here on the

1672
01:17:33,961 --> 01:17:35,220
podcast.
I appreciate it.

1673
01:17:35,221 --> 01:17:38,160
And people please go out buy her book.
Is there anything else you could

1674
01:17:38,161 --> 01:17:40,050
recommend people check into?

1675
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:41,940
They can.
They can donate to the nutrition

1676
01:17:41,941 --> 01:17:46,260
coalition if they want the dietary
guidelines to change and I'll just put a

1677
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,600
little plug for that because the reason
they have to change,

1678
01:17:48,601 --> 01:17:51,060
they control school lunches,
military rations,

1679
01:17:51,061 --> 01:17:53,280
food in hospitals,
food and elderly homes.

1680
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:56,100
Everything your doctor tells you,
your intuition is telling you.

1681
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,410
They're like,
that's where it all comes from.

1682
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,580
So that's it.
Thanks for letting me.

1683
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,980
Thank you.
Thanks for having me.

1684
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:03,520
Bye everybody.
