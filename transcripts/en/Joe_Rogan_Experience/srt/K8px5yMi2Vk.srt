00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,461
I mean this,

3
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:08,080
this process of biofeedback was discovered
in the late sixties on cat cats in a

4
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:08,681
tourist Lee,

5
00:00:08,681 --> 00:00:10,030
bad instruction followers,

6
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:10,864
right fuckers,

7
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,200
right?

8
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,070
So you're never going to,

9
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,540
this is not a cognitive process.

10
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,350
Cats didn't try to make it.

11
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,031
In this case,

12
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:19,690
cat's got a dropper of milk whenever
their brainwaves it up in one direction.

13
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,830
Milk came out a dropper and they learned
over time to produce more of this

14
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:25,450
brainwave that gave them the milk dropper.

15
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,353
Oh,

16
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:26,900
fascinate.

17
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,090
And then six months of this,

18
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:29,230
this one experiment that a,

19
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:31,090
a Dr. Barry Sterman did
in the late sixties,

20
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,200
six months later,

21
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:35,110
he pulled a bunch of cats out
of his subject pool to do a,

22
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:37,390
a rocket fuel exposure experiment.

23
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:38,021
NASA had said,

24
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:38,171
hey,

25
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:38,381
look,

26
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:40,000
our astronauts are getting really sick.

27
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,070
They're getting nauseous.

28
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,090
How dangerous is this?

29
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:43,271
You know,

30
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:45,550
hydrazine stuff we're
using as rocket fuel.

31
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,350
Could you please expose a
bunch of animals to it and see,

32
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:48,490
you know,

33
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,630
how much it takes to kill them,

34
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,740
um,

35
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:50,911
or,

36
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:51,041
or,

37
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,870
or what the dose response curve is.

38
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:55,840
And so doctor Sterman at
Ucla in the late sixties,

39
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:56,780
um,

40
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,820
it was exposing cats to increasing levels
of rocket fuel vapors and found that

41
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,421
little bit,

42
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:01,631
you know,

43
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:02,830
they planted a little more,

44
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:04,600
they stumbled a little more,

45
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:05,530
they cried.

46
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,820
And then like seizure,

47
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:07,241
coma,

48
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:07,810
death,

49
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,680
this nice linear,

50
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:08,891
you know,

51
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:11,260
with increasing dose except of the cats,

52
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:13,060
he was using a certain subset,

53
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:14,740
like six of 30 or something,

54
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,540
refuse to have seizures.

55
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,050
And the whole curve of unstable
brain was pushed to the right.

56
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,630
Couldn't figure out why until he realized,

57
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:22,721
oh,

58
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:23,200
wait a minute.

59
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,400
I use these same six cats in a previous
experiment to increase their brainwaves

60
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,590
in this one brainwave that,

61
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,480
that I thought was a
nice target to go after.

62
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,790
It turns out that brainwave
is the anti seizure brainwave.

63
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,441
When you train it up,

64
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:38,620
you have decreased dramatically
decreased seizure activity in the brain.

65
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,900
And so he found this,

66
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,141
you know,

67
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:43,420
this brainwave was sort of Metta stable,

68
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:43,701
eh,

69
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:44,071
in,

70
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,610
in encouraging brain activity.

71
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,030
And His lab manager at
the time was a medication,

72
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:49,930
uncontrolled,

73
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:50,764
epileptic,

74
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,260
having like tens of seizures a month,

75
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:55,240
which is basically a death sentence.

76
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:55,750
Your brain will,

77
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:55,901
you know,

78
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:57,270
Swiss cheese over time and you'll,

79
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,510
you'll have major,

80
00:01:58,511 --> 00:01:59,830
major longterm problems.

81
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:00,620
Um,

82
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,690
and she demanded,

83
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:04,330
he built her a biofeedback machine
to train up this brainwave.

84
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,450
And over the next year or two they did
some training and after a couple of years

85
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:08,410
she went off all meds.

86
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:09,244
I'm a seizure free.

87
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,270
Wow,

88
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,530
that's crazy.

89
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,740
And about that time Barry Sterman
is funding was all pulled.

90
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,450
Really.

91
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:16,991
He probably,

92
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:21,220
he submitted a paper to Epilepsia
the journal and suddenly his uh,

93
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,780
government funding all vanished.

94
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,470
So the conspiracy theorist,

95
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:26,760
uh,

96
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,041
you know,

97
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,390
ideas start to mount.

98
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:29,224
When you think about,

99
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,621
you know,

100
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:33,940
the late sixties and big drug companies
not wanting a non drug intervention for

101
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:34,810
epilepsy out there,

102
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,220
there are pockets are loaded with so
much fucking doe and they have been so

103
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:44,221
conditioned by a game that dehumanizes
people to the point where they no longer

104
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:50,290
see giant swaths of humans
and other countries as people.

105
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:50,801
The,

106
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:53,590
it is important to realize that these
wolves that you're talking about,

107
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,930
we're talking about a
different species here,

108
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:56,530
friend.

109
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,530
If you look at like what's going on in
the UK with these organized pedophile

110
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:01,901
rings,

111
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:06,340
it seemed to consist of people in
the highest level of government.

112
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,840
I can't remember who it was.

113
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,250
One of the investigators said,

114
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:12,520
it seems to be built into
the system in some way.

115
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:13,691
Yeah,

116
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:14,410
look it up.

117
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,150
It's scary fucking shit man.

118
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,500
That's insane.

119
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,460
So when you look ahead,

120
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,250
avoided that stuff cause it
bumped me out when I saw those,

121
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,901
those stores.

122
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:22,960
But that's what they're saying.

123
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,823
That's what they're saying.

124
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,910
But here's the difference.

125
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,451
Here's the difference.

126
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,550
And that's horrifying to
imagine cause you know this,

127
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,180
we hear it.

128
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,420
It's so funny to hear with the UK
government and people are like,

129
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,530
what?

130
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,560
But now you hear about a priest
doing it and people are like,

131
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:35,831
yeah,

132
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:36,820
that just happens.

133
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,630
It's like you're looking at an,

134
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,310
you know,

135
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,230
an organized system that has
as part of the destructive,

136
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,620
a result that it reaps on the planet.

137
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,210
Also psychically wounding children
in the worst way possible.

138
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,740
So this is a,

139
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,813
uh,

140
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,340
I think that that the,

141
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,020
the reason that that isn't as grim
and horrible as it sounds is cause the

142
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:07,021
difference today as opposed to 30 years
ago is that we get to say it in front of

143
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,800
however many zillions of people
listen to your podcast and it,

144
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,580
that info instantly travels
around the world 30 years ago.

145
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,680
If you think that if there truly is an
organized group of pedophiles that have

146
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:21,760
as their membership,

147
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,430
high ranking government officials,

148
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,460
not just probably in the UK
but in the United States too,

149
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,250
if that really does exist,

150
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,630
it didn't just start today or
last week or two years ago.

151
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,520
That's been around for a long,

152
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,140
long time.

153
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,350
So the difference between back then and
now is that shit is getting everywhere.

154
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:47,350
It's everyone on planet earth
is aware of this investigation.

155
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,660
You can't get that genie
back in the bottle.

156
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:51,430
Even though I think a
lot of people are trying,

157
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,610
they're saying that the
whistle blowers for for this,

158
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,241
uh,

159
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:56,560
are not going to have immunity.

160
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,080
That's one thing that the government,

161
00:04:58,081 --> 00:04:58,330
instead,

162
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,930
if you're a whistle blower for
this weird ring of pedophiles,

163
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,130
no immunity,

164
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,570
you're going to jail too.

165
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,160
So they're like squelching.

166
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,970
There seems to be an element that is
trying to push this shit down of course,

167
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:13,600
because if it's true that there that
some speculate that even members of the

168
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:16,030
royal family could be
involved in this shit.

169
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,590
So yeah,

170
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:18,040
look it up.

171
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,431
I usually,

172
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:23,020
it's a deep dark David Lynch
level twin peaks shit coaster.

173
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,670
But the,

174
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,503
the,

175
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,813
the,

176
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,120
that might be one of the
best descriptions ever.

177
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,393
Say that again.

178
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,540
A deep dark David Lynch level shit goes to

179
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,340
twin peaks style worms deep in the ground.

180
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,210
This is,

181
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:46,511
but,

182
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,090
but the positive thing is
they're getting exposed.

183
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,760
What do you think about us tie steel
cups for grappling competition?

184
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:56,350
So they're not sure they're
getting outlawed and a lot
of grappling competitions

185
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,310
because they that extra leverage,

186
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,050
they're like a fulcrum point.

187
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,130
Like a leverage point.

188
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:01,941
Okay,

189
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:02,420
Lynn,

190
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,650
then everybody's got a free ball,

191
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,130
three ball and you just gotta use that
third hook wrap your Dyngus around there.

192
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:11,520
And I'm saying you see him,

193
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,180
we bring Brian on these podcasts
or wouldn't goes in the fucking,

194
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,431
well,

195
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:14,850
here's the,

196
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,470
here's the thing,

197
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,011
here's the no,

198
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:16,910
I mean I'm here.

199
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,500
I'm barely 11 and a half,

200
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,360
so I wouldn't have,

201
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:20,660
I don't,

202
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,340
I usually don't train with a cup.

203
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,530
You don't know because my
legs are so big that it's,

204
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,570
it rubs with bruising in the,

205
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,800
in the inside of my thighs.

206
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,751
I personally,

207
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:37,390
I have a thing I like to call it combat
cock where everything just pulls in sin.

208
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,910
Yeah.

209
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,090
Do you remember those guys knows better
than to get fucking hanging out there.

210
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:41,301
Hey,

211
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:41,931
how you doing?

212
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:44,240
What's up high five with
your blood's educated.

213
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,140
My Dick is smart.

214
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,460
Just like the Shaolin Monks.

215
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:48,320
I've known guys who have
lost a ball from that.

216
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:48,920
Yeah.

217
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,430
Not me.

218
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,681
Yeah.

219
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:50,840
Well there's Brian Foster's.

220
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:51,110
I was,

221
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,441
it was,

222
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:52,210
it was my foster.

223
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,700
UFC isn't training and he got
kicked in the balls and last one.

224
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,543
It was balls.

225
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,270
Yeah.

226
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,980
Did you ever find it just to

227
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,390
make terrible decisions?

228
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,490
What's going on?

229
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,900
His Dick is always like,

230
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:06,734
what are you doing?

231
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,910
Where is Dick as Ben?

232
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,160
Can you imagine if
Dick's lucky to be alive?

233
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,200
Yes,

234
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,033
I have it.

235
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,050
I've seen like pictures.

236
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:15,320
Oh,

237
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,190
you've been in the room,

238
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,061
you know,

239
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:20,360
like you after it's over,

240
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,160
you just want to take like a whole,

241
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:23,660
like a bottle of paint
than her and be like,

242
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:25,690
you need to just dip in this real quick.

243
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,150
Okay.
