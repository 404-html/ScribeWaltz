1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,030
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,090
[inaudible]

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,020
that was a beautiful day.

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,650
Beautiful Day to be back in California.

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,430
How about this weather we'll
live in like doctors out here.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,220
It doesn't get on nicer than this.

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,220
We got leopards behind.

8
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:33,400
This is getting nicer.

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,370
It's perfect weather.

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,480
Really appreciate California
when he goes somewhere else.

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,340
I just wish there weren't
so many fucking people,

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,020
but I guess that's just part of the

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,590
most important thing.

14
00:00:45,591 --> 00:00:47,120
Why we love all you.

15
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:47,990
People will always say,

16
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:49,640
well we got good stuff by us.

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,200
Still bid on that dog.

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,641
That's number one.

19
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:57,080
Oh g dirty 3.94% tested a February.

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:57,920
That means what?

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,780
That next doc comes up as September.

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,310
People's heads will be blown up like gene
Simmons in that weren't fucking movie

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,240
is that it just blew the fuck up man.

24
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,660
That was with Tom Selleck?

25
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,200
No,

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,690
that was with the guy that's German.

27
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:12,260
That was it.

28
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,771
Oh Rutger.

29
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:13,420
Hauer okay.

30
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,110
How I want it dead or alive.

31
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,460
Well he goes up to him and he goes give
200,000 to whatever it separately the

32
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:21,210
bonus and he goes to Tony.

33
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:23,950
It looks back at Gene Simmons
and he touches his face.

34
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:24,460
Oh,

35
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,030
sleep polls the clip out of his
mouth and he looks at the other guys.

36
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:27,480
He goes,

37
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,820
fuck the boldest and it blows.

38
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,500
It just blows his fucking head off.

39
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,120
That's just going to be
happening in September.

40
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,140
So Gene Simmons just got arrested or
charged with some sort of sexual assault.

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,630
Really?

42
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:39,841
Yeah.

43
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:40,621
Some they complain.

44
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:43,260
He says he grabbed her on her shit.

45
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,400
He slept with 9,000 would you
think it needs to fucking some fat?

46
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,340
Make up the thank you know you
want to keep the party rolling man.

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:50,911
You know,

48
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,940
sometimes everybody wants to go home
and they want the party to be over.

49
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,660
You want to it love Jean said Miss,

50
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,140
I love Gene Simmons to put that fucker.

51
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:00,130
We've has got to go.

52
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,440
God,

53
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,770
it's got to go get really bad.

54
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,670
Yeah.

55
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,400
It could see us like old spiderweb,

56
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,640
the spy,

57
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,120
the worst the most is they just painted
it black and put it on his fucking head.

58
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,031
All rockers,

59
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:15,361
man.

60
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:16,560
Nobody ever did that before.

61
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,330
Nobody ever got old in front of us.

62
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:18,910
You know,

63
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,040
nobody was ever young.

64
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,280
And then we made it all the
way to being like an old dude,

65
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,750
still doing the same act.

66
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,141
You know,

67
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,340
that never really happened before.

68
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:26,940
Right.

69
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,211
I mean,

70
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:30,630
I guess it sort of happened in
the forties and fifties and shit,

71
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,490
but a lot of those dudes just died.

72
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,821
You know,

73
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:36,120
like Elvis died and buddy
Holly died and you know,

74
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:36,570
I mean,

75
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,790
not that many dudes just really,

76
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,140
I started went a jail.

77
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:40,770
Yeah,

78
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,581
that's my boy.

79
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:41,821
Right.

80
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:43,320
John Lennon got shot at the Beatles,

81
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:43,891
broke up.

82
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:44,970
George Harrison's dead.

83
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,110
You know,

84
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,740
it is not,

85
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,910
not a whole lot of dudes that went all
the way from the 70s all the way to

86
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:51,720
today,

87
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,440
rocking out,

88
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,400
doing the same thing.

89
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,353
You know,

90
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,620
who had the rolling stones?

91
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:55,980
Man,

92
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,240
they're still fucking pulling it off.

93
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,630
Right.

94
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,463
Books

95
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,491
still pulling it up,

96
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:03,040
still going to Brazil
and banging tens is it,

97
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,750
didn't he just like have
a baby or something?

98
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,710
Didn't Mick Jagger?

99
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,100
So he's got dark team or
babies and all little sports.

100
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,223
Vega.

101
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
That motherfucker Bro.

102
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:14,470
When he tricked this old wife.

103
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,863
Yeah.

104
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,990
Later in another country.

105
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,711
And she's like,

106
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:18,081
what?

107
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:18,450
I go,

108
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:18,821
he's like,

109
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:19,420
bitch,

110
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,530
check the fine print

111
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:22,760
though.

112
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,940
Can I paid that guy $8
you know what I'm saying?

113
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,170
That shit don't work.

114
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:26,990
Exactly.

115
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,430
Legit.

116
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,150
Can you do that?

117
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,601
I don't know.

118
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,280
I don't think that holds up.

119
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,113
Jacket did it?

120
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,060
He still asked to pray.

121
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,720
Listen Bro.

122
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,940
Mick Jagger's with her best
book and spending my time.

123
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,710
I was living in boulder.

124
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:37,660
They played Bolga at the stadium.

125
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,200
It was like a three hour delay
and like a bunch of weight.

126
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,830
I was talking to some
people don't like dog.

127
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:45,790
Mick Jagger showed up and seen that the
tickets were still having to be behind

128
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,624
the stage.

129
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,510
He didn't give a fuck if
they couldn't see him.

130
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,280
I ain't going on stage.

131
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,970
You saw those tickets really?

132
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,490
He made them sell apples.

133
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,360
Talking tickets with,

134
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,230
couldn't even see this to give
it to them for half price.

135
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,093
You got to get some.

136
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,091
Wow.

137
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,290
He's a fucking businessman.

138
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,671
Fuck yeah.

139
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:01,740
Three hours late for you,

140
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,420
so I don't care.

141
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,160
I have nothing to do.

142
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,090
How do you know that it was him?

143
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:05,410
It was his decision then the buckets.

144
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,610
He was the businessman.

145
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,860
He was the last and a
real boy he could spend.

146
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,080
You have a mechanic hat on?

147
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,630
Is it from the new movie?

148
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,081
Yeah,

149
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:15,850
but I'm supporting the
old one out of respect,

150
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,713
the old movies,

151
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,573
you know what I'm saying?

152
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,910
The bumpers or even I wouldn't fucking
watch them with my eyeballs of his

153
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,040
planning lawyer was watching his plane.

154
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,103
He was,

155
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,710
it was okay.

156
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,340
It wasn't bad.

157
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,173
I liked that dude.

158
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,081
I like him too,

159
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,140
but he ain't going to Charles Bronson.

160
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,521
You can't.

161
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:34,450
Oh yeah,

162
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:35,171
that's a problem,

163
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:35,351
man.

164
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,320
When you can't do a movie,

165
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,560
I mean you play a great assassin,

166
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,790
but when you called the mechanic and then
you have sort of the same sort of plot

167
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:43,570
twist,

168
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,240
and then he takes out a protege and it
didn't make sense that he took out a

169
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:48,400
protege in this movie in
Charles Bronson's movie.

170
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,740
Charles Bronson seems like
legitimately troubled.

171
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,190
This guy seemed like all of a sudden
he's breaking his own rules and he's

172
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:57,740
hanging out with this dude just
cause he killed his dad without fuck.

173
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,541
And it didn't.

174
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:58,931
It didn't,

175
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,150
I didn't buy it in a
Charles Bronson movie.

176
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:02,850
I bought troubled.

177
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,280
It was a bad mother fucker dude.

178
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,870
When he was doing hard times,

179
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,250
he was like 50,

180
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,070
you know that when he did that
fucking cage fighting movie,

181
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,093
you remember that Shit.

182
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,043
Fuck yeah.

183
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,200
He was like 50 years old and we did that
movie and we get the fuck out of here.

184
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,081
Thanks.

185
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:20,914
You do the podcast.

186
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,193
Hello

187
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,580
Bam.

188
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,400
Podcasts over ours fear you.

189
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:29,090
How you and Brian had a little hissy fit.

190
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,440
How do you think you
guys recovered from that?

191
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:31,240
It's not a his foot.

192
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,400
No.

193
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,350
Was it mostly it was just
the point was that um,

194
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,660
you need to trust the people.

195
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,071
They do stuff around.

196
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:37,970
So no matter what,

197
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,400
even if people don't know
what we're talking about,

198
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,610
they had a psychedelic
adventure to psychedelics.

199
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:42,951
You're doing.

200
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:46,820
Psychedelics could be in a place where
you feel comfortable like podcast six

201
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:49,410
comedian comedy took me a while.

202
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:53,370
The being smoking at the UFC and
then doing edibles at Eoc to them.

203
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,990
Then move up to feeling comfortable
enough in this environment.

204
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,913
I can do acid.

205
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,401
I wouldn't do that.

206
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,234
My first trips.

207
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,880
Do you think you were
trying to get new ones?

208
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,050
You got to do it July 1st.

209
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,250
July 2nd.

210
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,083
Here's my plan.

211
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,133
Announced right here.

212
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,590
Okay.

213
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,510
I'm having a scavenger hunt for edibles.

214
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,803
Um,

215
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,810
I don't know how to do it yet.

216
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,260
Yes,

217
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,610
I guess I know how I'm gonna do it,

218
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:16,130
but there's gotta be some way that if you
find a phrase and come find me and say

219
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:18,800
whatever the phrase that is
like president of the amazing,

220
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:19,610
whatever it is,

221
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,001
I'll be like,

222
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:20,360
boom.

223
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,781
There you go.

224
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,410
Have a good trip.

225
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,640
I think you are at early on.

226
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:25,250
Grossly underestimating
the power of the podcast.

227
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,360
You're fucked right now.

228
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,680
You're fucked man.

229
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,070
Alright.

230
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,880
Scavenge Hunt and officers of the
law would be able to easily do that.

231
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,091
Yeah,

232
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:32,450
you're ready?

233
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:32,841
Hey,

234
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:33,130
I am.

235
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,060
The secret word is I'm a
cop and you're under arrest.

236
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,343
Okay,

237
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,423
this guy's crazy.

238
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,031
He's a rebel.

239
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:42,590
He's a practical,

240
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:43,191
regular hunter.

241
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:43,940
S Thompson.

242
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,210
Nope.

243
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:44,540
There's no,

244
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,260
if you're a captain,

245
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,370
[inaudible] was just fucking,

246
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,881
it's fine.

247
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:47,970
Nobody's getting hurt on this one.

248
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,220
They might get hurt,

249
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,270
but if you're one of those guys,

250
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,980
we're going to figure out a
way to do a scavenger hunt.

251
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,390
And if I leave clues tape,

252
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:56,000
don't be a Douche or fucking rips them
off because I have to think that though

253
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:56,530
too.

254
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:56,890
Right,

255
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,380
right.

256
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,213
They'll be like,

257
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,481
no one else has got it.

258
00:06:59,481 --> 00:06:59,731
Yeah.

259
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:00,531
Do you can't do that.

260
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:03,470
You can't cheat because maybe you
should have some kind of a rule.

261
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:03,801
Yeah.

262
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:05,600
You've got to have a way to
get it there on the couch.

263
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,110
Stop.

264
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,943
Yeah.

265
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,830
Well we'll make like go
to this concession stand.

266
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:13,190
The third line where say the safest way
to do it is to hide the stuff somewhere

267
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,200
to say that you're gonna put it like go
to some like shirt and put it like under

268
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:22,130
the skull tee shirt and then Twitter at
Twitter where you put it and then leave.

269
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,123
Oh,

270
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:23,930
oh.

271
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,450
I thought it was like I didn't have it
that way where they could actually just

272
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,580
find the thing I had like
one is caption for clue.

273
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,660
This will take you there.

274
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,560
That clue takes you there and then that
gives you the price and then price is

275
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:34,880
kind of complicated for stoners,

276
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:35,840
so just where it is,

277
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:39,410
you just decide to take brownies
and insert them in place.

278
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:42,920
It's like there's the gas cowboy boots
on the face of the earth during this

279
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:43,490
store.

280
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:43,711
Yes.

281
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:44,270
Something like that.

282
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,860
Reach inside if you find those.

283
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,311
Yeah,

284
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:48,200
and then come my,

285
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,600
I had my mind that they would come up
to me and I can see what they were and

286
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:51,440
just watch him do it.

287
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:52,011
But you know what?

288
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:52,341
Fuck it.

289
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,061
Just tell me who you are.

290
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:53,894
You can always say,

291
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,273
uh Huh.

292
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,121
I've heard it.

293
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:57,470
If you go over to that store,

294
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,890
do you find the gaze boots in the world
and inside that boot is a Brownie.

295
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,120
Could just be a rumor.

296
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:02,721
Can you say that?

297
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:04,490
That way you absolve
yourself with any criminal?

298
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,440
Not just,

299
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:07,011
that's the word.

300
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:07,801
The word on the street is,

301
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,680
is a Brownie in those gay cowboy boots.

302
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,311
It's like a quick,

303
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:10,551
you know,

304
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:10,880
whatever.

305
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,713
Something like that.

306
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,240
I see a purple fucking plan.

307
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,010
All right.

308
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,680
It's all right.

309
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
We've got a plan folks.

310
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,330
July 2nd shit's going down.

311
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,670
Talking monkey is not involved
with the actual purchase or

312
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,673
very good.

313
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,130
Yeah.

314
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,963
Okay.

315
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,280
Another beautiful day in southern
California and I'm with my pal Duncan

316
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,400
Trussell.

317
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,000
Hi.

318
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,540
We just got done doing
the podcast and you,

319
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,620
he introduced me to the whitest teeth.

320
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:43,880
Do you know the pledge of allegiance?

321
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:44,840
I pledge allegiance.

322
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:45,261
Where as kids,

323
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:45,860
you know,

324
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,520
check it out.

325
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,250
Fucking genius versus
shove this into that,

326
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,660
into the podcast where we get sued.

327
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,150
That probably get in trouble for it.

328
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,070
It's so good that I think the widest kids,

329
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,381
you know,

330
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,570
we'll probably be dead
within a week daily.

331
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,200
I think their,

332
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,280
their plane's going down.

333
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,133
I

334
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,853
don't think he was.

335
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,120
You're on a plane with the widest kids,

336
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:03,421
you know,

337
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:03,900
get off.

338
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,160
Yeah,

339
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,850
get off.

340
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,450
Freak out.

341
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,230
Have a freak out.

342
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,160
It's going to jail.

343
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,301
It's worth going to jail.

344
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:09,080
Stay alive.

345
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,010
It's brilliant though.

346
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,650
The pledge of allegiance
things fucking amazing.

347
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,783
It's perfect.

348
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,220
It's like talking about how creepy it is.

349
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,240
How many kids recite?

350
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:18,140
I don't want to tell you anymore.

351
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,450
It's just,

352
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,120
it's all,

353
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,650
it's good to check it out too.

354
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:26,360
We always go to some crazy deep ass
fucking weird place when we do the task.

355
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,760
But you don't do that that
much on your lavender hour,

356
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,550
right?

357
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,190
Well,

358
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:30,620
it,

359
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:30,981
yeah,

360
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:31,360
it did.

361
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,540
Not as much as we get on this.

362
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,570
I don't do this that much anywhere I these
kinds of conversations like I'll have

363
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,360
them with Natasha.

364
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,700
We're not recording stuff,

365
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:43,220
but I don't have them all the time.

366
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:44,270
I'd probably be in a hospital.

367
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,890
These are the kind of car I'd be pushing
a cart down Laci in it goes screaming.

368
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,510
Yes.

369
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,343
Screening.

370
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,190
What is it about this podcast that brings
it out in you and makes you have these

371
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,540
crazy conversations with us?

372
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,081
Oh,

373
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:59,390
it's probably a combination of the super
strong marijuana and you put a black

374
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,420
gets in the coconut water.

375
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,770
It's nature coming together.

376
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,790
Some sort of a weird concocted
combination of chemicals.

377
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:11,980
Events.

378
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,670
Yeah.

379
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,840
Maybe it's your tattoo.

380
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,101
Maybe like a,

381
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:18,310
you get sucked in the summer too,

382
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,840
but it's great if it was good.

383
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:24,750
Good.

384
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,540
All sleeved up.

385
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,373
If you can take the pain,

386
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,080
take the pain.

387
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:29,321
Man,

388
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:29,980
I just stopped.

389
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,813
I don't know what the fuck.

390
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,181
I don't know.

391
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:32,020
What to put on my arm.

392
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,370
I can't make the decision.

393
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:34,600
I changed my mind so much.

394
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,840
Nikola Tesla with a a bottle in his hand.

395
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,820
That's a great Tequila drinking.

396
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,870
That's a great idea,

397
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:40,320
man.

398
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,800
But the PR,

399
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,990
this is why I don't want to tattoo.

400
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,230
Here's why I don't want to tattoo.

401
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,050
Why LIGO?

402
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,980
Tesla fucking that pigeon that he loved
so much because you got to explain it to

403
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:47,790
everybody.

404
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,160
It'd be creates a talking
point for strangers.

405
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,311
Well,

406
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:51,480
if you ever break up with your check,

407
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:51,950
you've got them.

408
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,950
You got something sort of slapped that
thing down at the bar and the girls would

409
00:10:57,051 --> 00:10:57,241
go,

410
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,110
what is that?

411
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,940
Fucking a pigeon.

412
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:00,450
Yeah.

413
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,310
Well you don't know
the Nikola Tesla story,

414
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,144
honey.

415
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,961
Yeah,

416
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:05,730
that's exactly how I operated.

417
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,070
I happened to have a DVD in my fanny pack.

418
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,971
It's amazing.

419
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,040
I did a thing called
drunk history and HPL.

420
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,480
You might've seen it here.

421
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:15,730
Check.

422
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,060
Can we,

423
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,250
can we put that on a podcast?

424
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:17,941
That drunk history.

425
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:18,810
Can we show people that?

426
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,201
Well,

427
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:19,981
it's on youtube.

428
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:20,611
I don't know if you can.

429
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:21,444
It's not mine,

430
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,440
so it's probably not.

431
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:23,660
It's HBO.

432
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,350
We just stick it in here
and put it on Youtube.

433
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,341
It's on youtube.

434
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:27,810
If you embed a youtube link,

435
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:29,220
just youtube drunk history,

436
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:29,671
Tesla,

437
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:30,504
but it's not

438
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,733
the beginning.

439
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,490
They got their fingers
in your now it's true.

440
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,630
It's true.

441
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,690
Once we started getting on serious,

442
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,010
bringing in lawyers,

443
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,640
but I think lawyers will
scare them with our plans to,

444
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:47,160
to move this into some sort
of a cable television format.

445
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,460
I don't think we're going to lose much
as long as we continue to do it exactly

446
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:51,294
the same way.

447
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,100
I think it will be a little bit more
complicated cause it'll be on a set

448
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,000
instead of in my house.

449
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:56,040
But look,

450
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:56,540
if it sucks,

451
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,970
we'll just start doing
them in my house too.

452
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,421
Well yeah,

453
00:11:58,421 --> 00:11:59,230
do both.

454
00:11:59,230 --> 00:11:59,411
Yeah.

455
00:11:59,411 --> 00:11:59,981
They can't stop me.

456
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:00,940
If you get out of your one,

457
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:02,920
the time TV and one that's uncensored,

458
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,813
we could do that.

459
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,030
We can do it one day a week on television
and the other days a week do it here.

460
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,531
If it is,

461
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:08,364
we do that.

462
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,520
The key is to just keep doing
it the key or now seems to be,

463
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:12,970
uh,

464
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,450
when you,

465
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:13,931
your approach,

466
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:17,140
all the social networking stuff and you
look at like how it's helped people in

467
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:17,531
the past,

468
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:19,300
like Dane Cook and he's the master of it.

469
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:21,550
Obviously when you look how it helped him,

470
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,880
said it was a slow build and slowly
built to the point where it sort of,

471
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,163
you know,

472
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,430
took on a life of its own.

473
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,910
I think the model you should follow
for you though is not Dane Cook.

474
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:32,440
I think it's David Koresh.

475
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,570
It was a slow bells for him too,

476
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,350
but you're going to have
a terrible ATF agents,

477
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:38,801
Mormon.

478
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,000
You're fucking studio.

479
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,180
Once they know where it is.

480
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,980
Why,

481
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,813
what are we doing wrong?

482
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,920
I don't know yet.

483
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:45,821
What are we doing wrong?

484
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:47,230
He starts off with some ideas,

485
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,670
man.

486
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,890
Good.

487
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,150
I'm not looking to
overthrow the government.

488
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,680
I'm looking at to get high
and we'd go to movies.

489
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,260
I want to get high,

490
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,770
go to movies and overthrow the government.

491
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,540
I don't think work man.

492
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,040
I don't measure of running the government.

493
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,691
I loved it.

494
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:05,411
I love this country.

495
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:05,980
I left the government,

496
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,850
the United States of America.

497
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:10,420
I left police officers that will cover
it and I don't want to do anything mean

498
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:11,254
to you guys.

499
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:12,671
I love you.

500
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:13,504
Please don't kill me.

501
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,613
That said,

502
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,080
that's the end of this video blog,

503
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,450
which is three in one week.

504
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,343
I hope you liked it.

505
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:20,600
Oh,

506
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:20,970
sure.

507
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,803
We'll mix it up.

508
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,510
Al Magical.

509
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,440
It's just on the podcast.

510
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:24,130
Ladies and gentlemen.

511
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:24,800
That was great.

512
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,520
I have known Al for at least 10 years,

513
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:27,910
right?

514
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,091
Yeah.

515
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:29,440
I'd be more 10 years.

516
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,500
Years.

517
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,290
Yeah.

518
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,120
Did we smoke pot in
your friend's apartment?

519
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,800
It was my apartment was your apartment?

520
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:35,911
No,

521
00:13:35,911 --> 00:13:36,744
we watch old.

522
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,661
That's right.

523
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:38,021
We did.

524
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:38,980
We watch over from [inaudible].

525
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,170
Are you sure?

526
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,003
Yeah.

527
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,663
Thanks.

528
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,090
I'm fascinated by Oprah,

529
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,650
which I am certain extent,

530
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,870
but it's been going on for that log

531
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,061
by Oprah.

532
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:51,630
Fascinating.

533
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:51,751
No,

534
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:52,710
we sat there going like this.

535
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:54,000
I remember just eating salad,

536
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:54,140
right?

537
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,160
Just looking at it like,

538
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:55,510
yeah,

539
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,343
look,

540
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:56,810
yeah.

541
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,950
This was the non assertive.

542
00:13:57,951 --> 00:13:59,750
Oprah didn't have control
of her own destiny.

543
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,680
This was the Oprah that really was just
like interviewing like KKK members and

544
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:05,600
stuff and people would
sit and folding chairs.

545
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:09,480
It was like old school Oprah where
you're a huge color purple fan or no,

546
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,700
and everyone wants that movie.

547
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,160
That dude,

548
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,370
that Gif of her taking the
piss and colored Provo.

549
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,740
We just did it over and over again.

550
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:20,200
So just to take it over a p,

551
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,091
I would,

552
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:21,590
um,

553
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,920
I would love to meet that
Steadman character and hang
out with him and find out

554
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:25,631
what's going on with that.

555
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:25,770
Right.

556
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,480
Insane.

557
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,160
What does she do for companionship?

558
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,600
She's got a beard.

559
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:31,950
Okay.

560
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,000
Nick's got a girlfriend.

561
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,780
Her name,

562
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,330
that girlfriend that Gail chick has
her boyfriend or her girlfriends.

563
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,790
Yeah.

564
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,030
Thanks.

565
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,900
So a lot of people do.

566
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,500
I pick it.

567
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,140
And then that other dude that
Steadman guys like hanging around,

568
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:44,160
who knows who gives a fuck?

569
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,090
It would be sad.

570
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:45,181
Oh,

571
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:45,991
well maybe that would be cool,

572
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:46,201
man.

573
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:47,070
What is she came out?

574
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,380
What if she retired or
shout and then came out?

575
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,603
That would be kind of funny.

576
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,563
I think she's,

577
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,513
I think she's gay.

578
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,740
It doesn't matter.

579
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,800
It's not gonna ruin your career.

580
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,221
No,

581
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:55,400
no,

582
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:55,610
no.

583
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,540
I think she's fantastic.

584
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:56,961
I do too.

585
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:57,530
I love Oprah.

586
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,700
But there was always this notion for it.

587
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,740
I do love Oprah.

588
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,800
I think Oprah is a very positive man.

589
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,950
I listened to her,

590
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:04,250
uh,

591
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:04,640
her,

592
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,473
her show,

593
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,440
she's positive.

594
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,100
Look man,

595
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,641
like I said,

596
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:08,810
not everyone's out magical.

597
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,650
Not everyone's view,

598
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,490
not everyone's made.

599
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,960
It's different people that
have different tastes.

600
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,790
I like watching professional pool.

601
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:14,600
You know,

602
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,480
most people think is probably one of the
most boring fucking things in the world

603
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:18,020
to watch.

604
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,890
I'll never say what's,

605
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,221
you know,

606
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:20,690
when anybody shouldn't,

607
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:21,524
shouldn't like,

608
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,110
but I recognize that
for people like Oprah,

609
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:25,610
for women that are like,

610
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:26,570
have like a huge,

611
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:27,180
and you know,

612
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,760
and like interest and like,

613
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,800
she's fucking fantastic guru.

614
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:31,340
Yeah.

615
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:31,740
She's a,

616
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,080
she's majestic man.

617
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:33,620
She,

618
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:33,950
those,

619
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,521
those women,

620
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:35,720
they found a voice.

621
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:38,300
They found someone who just really,

622
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,650
not just relates to them,

623
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:42,680
but elevates them and gives them something
where they feel like they belong to.

624
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,090
There's gotta be a big void.

625
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,163
Who's gonna fill it?

626
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:45,850
Magical.

627
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,120
Why don't you put on a dress and maybe
you can get an actual grout there.

628
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,213
Let's do it together.

629
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,000
You don't have to put on a dress that's
do it will wear dresses and we'll

630
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,590
pretend we're women and
we won't even address it.

631
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,593
Give her breastfeed.

632
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,950
Cut that out because it's not funny.

633

He can't,

638
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,190
he can't miss it.

639
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,761
Get that shit.

640
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:11,761
If right now it's on just minivan men.com
eventually it'll go on iTunes and you

641
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:13,630
could fall out on Twitter.

642
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,730

oh God.

662
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,840
It really write things down.

00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,661
What's that guy's name?

679
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:14,650
Leaner that got busted.

680
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,593
Tony Wiener.

681
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:17,621
Yeah.

682
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:18,131
What does he do?

683
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:18,901
Is he a senator?

684
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:19,734
What does the center,

685
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,053
something like that.

686
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:22,960
Yeah,

687
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,580
he has like 8,000 followers on Twitter.

688
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,670
And at what points does anybody ever
actually landed a girl by sitting in the

689
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,050
corner of,

690
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,380
that's for sure.

691
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,620
That's why they're doing so I met her,

692
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,930
I think it's about,

693
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,170
you got same question in the room,

694
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:35,621
but everyone goes,

695
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:35,830
no,

696
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,931
no,

697
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:36,040
no.

698
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,790
And he goes,

699
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,200
I did.

700
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,033
And then

701
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,580
it's all about swinging
at a lot of pitches.

702
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:43,414
I think

703
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,350
it doesn't matter if you
strike out you a swing.

704
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,560
I got a buddy of mine,

705
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,160
he would fuck anything.

706
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,310
And for every disgusting
girl he would land.

707
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,690
He would land a super hockey.

708
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:55,020
Yeah.

709
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,020
Cause he just didn't give a shit.

710
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:56,761
He's like,

711
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:56,911
look,

712
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:57,744
there's a whole,

713
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:58,710
yeah,

714
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,990
I have a buddy who is
not an attractive guy,

715
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:02,400
but he will hit on anything.

716
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,061
And he goes,

717
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:03,181
hey,

718
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:03,760
you never know.

719
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,593
You never know.

720
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,083
There's no answers.

721
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,020
That confidence that they're like,

722
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:07,580
all right.

723
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,171
And then there's the guy,

724
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,004
he just runs his mouth,

725
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,640
but something happens to
them as they get older,

726
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:12,850
they start getting crazy

727
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:15,270
sorrow,

728
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,930
like trying to lock off objection that
they're getting constant objecting to go

729
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,850
like 90% ejection temperature,

730
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,990
10% acceptance.

731
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,900
So 90% you get the fuck away.

732
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,890
The guys who just keep the fucking fine.

733
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:29,724
All right.

734
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,433
Shut up.

735
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,453
Shut up.

736
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,230
You very much enjoy Vancouver
nugget when he'd be ladies.

737
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,953
Nice meeting you.

738
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,490
If I did it today,

739
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,990
if I did it today,

740
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,000
it'd be different too because
I'm a different person.

741
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,080
I'm a different person.

742
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,370
I was just four or five years ago,

743
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,180
you know,

744
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,470
I think I'd be better at it today.

745
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,141
I got him,

746
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:52,760
uh,

747
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,750
I have more patients,

748
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,943
you know,

749
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,350
especially um,

750
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,973
fear factor.

751
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,341
Yeah.

752
00:18:58,341 --> 00:18:59,660
If I started doing fear factor again,

753
00:18:59,680 --> 00:18:59,940
I have,

754
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,780
I have more patience with people
I think than I ever had back then,

755
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,910
which is ridiculous
when you think about it.

756
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,570
Yeah.

757
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,261
But I'm excited.

758
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:07,094
I think it would be fun.

759
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,820
I don't know.

760
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,690
I don't know if it's going to happen.

761
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,973
I think it'd be interesting,

762
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,440
but I'm so fucking busy right now between
the UFC on the road comedy and writing

763
00:19:15,441 --> 00:19:18,830
and doing this podcast and all
these different things that I love.

764
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,570
I love doing all of them.

765
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:20,990
So it's,

766
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,550
it's hard to think about
doing something else.

767
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,321
I do think though,

768
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:24,400
if you do do it,

769
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,140
it would help all your other things
and make all your other things better.

770
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,100
It feels like it,

771
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,930
you know,

772
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,090
it was all of our babies,

773
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:37,811
you know,

774
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:39,400
that show was all of our babies,

775
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,600
but

776
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,140
the,

777
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,650
you know,

778
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,880
but to me it was like I was there
for every fucking one of them.

779
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,540
Yeah.

780
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,373
I mean there was,

781
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,390
there's 148 episodes.

782
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,051
I was there,

783
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:50,740
the whole thing.

784
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,110
So I feel like for me
it almost feels like,

785
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:53,390
man,

786
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,820
if someone else is doing it,

787
00:19:54,821 --> 00:19:56,290
it's like someone is wearing my condom.

788
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,560
Yeah.

789
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,393
Yeah.

790
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,630
It's not like someone's fucking my wife,

791
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,060
but it's like someone is wearing right.

792
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,893
And My condo,

793
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,540
like you're doing it your way I guess.

794
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,750
But Hey man,

795
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:05,584
what are you doing with that?

796
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,040
I would feel real weird.

797
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,970
But now it makes me feel like a super
douche bag for doing the man show.

798
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,170
You know?

799
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,430
Because like for Jimmy and Adam,

800
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:16,980
it's really so great to
have someone else do it.

801
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,610
I would have never heard that knows if
that came up again and someone said,

802
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:21,600
would you do the match on now?

803
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:23,070
And I've never in a million years,

804
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:23,904
but I do it.

805
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,250
I was delusional.

806
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,570
You were stepping into a
machine with that show.

807
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:27,991
Why don't you,

808
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:30,360
and you didn't really
have room to take it over.

809
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:30,530
No,

810
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:30,990
they wouldn't.

811
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,200
They want it to fit like in
their model of what it was.

812
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:36,030
And so whenever you compromise,

813
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:36,540
you know,

814
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,590
two ideas together,

815
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:38,920
smash up and it's just,

816
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,931
it's going to suck.

817
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:40,860
It's going to be mediocre.

818
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,760
And that's what it was.

819
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,350
But we shouldn't have done
it in the first place.

820
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,860
But I should've done is contacted them
and see if they really had a problem with

821
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,060
it the way we were led to believe.

822
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:49,511
It's like that.

823
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:49,991
They don't care.

824
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:50,824
They're done with it.

825
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,850
Did you ever ask them?

826
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,600
Yeah,

827
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:52,930
yeah,

828
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,290
yeah.

829
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,220
Jimmy Kimmel had some,

830
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,690
some strong words about the producers
and how it all went down and he was very

831
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:03,691
upset with how it went down and he sent
me a little letter and left me an email.

832
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:06,130
So we had a nice little back and forth.

833
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,850
Yeah.

834
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,350
That's the nature of things in general,

835
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:08,621
man.

836
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:09,251
They crumble.

837
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:09,480
They,

838
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,720
the systems fall apart.

839
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,040
The way they had it organized,

840
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:16,360
it was destined to change and you can't
have the two different hosts doing a

841
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,130
comedy show and have it be the same show.

842
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,360
That's not going to be the same shot.

843
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,520
I wonder if they're ever going to
release it on DVD or happening.

844
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,383
I hope they don't.

845
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,740
Just one of those things.

846
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,573
I didn't let it go.

847
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,041
Let it out.

848
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:25,874
Fire.

849
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,260
I apologize.

850
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,290
The Jimmy Kimmel show.

851
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,160
That's cool.

852
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,070
So I was sorry when I did and it was okay.

853
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,973
I just got greedy.

854
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,670
Like the idea of being able to
do two TV shows at the same time.

855
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:36,700
It's like that's ridiculous.

856
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:37,690
Can I actually do that?

857
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:38,261
You know?

858
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:41,020
And then the idea of also being
able to do something comedy wise.

859
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:44,080
Cause then it was a little weird doing
for your factor cause it was like God,

860
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,591
you know,

861
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:47,080
a huge percent of the people
don't even know I'm a comedian.

862
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,500
Yeah.

863
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,000
When I'd say it'd be appearing somewhere,

864
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:49,421
they'd be like,

865
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:49,871
what's he doing?

866
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:50,680
Or your factor guy?

867
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:50,920
Yeah.

868
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,261
What's he doing?

869
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:52,094
And get a feed somebody.

870
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,070
Yeah.

871
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,431
Well boy,

872
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:55,420
where's the wombs?

873
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,263
Yeah,

874
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,163
we won't

875
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,590
hear that way,

876
00:22:00,591 --> 00:22:00,921
man.

877
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:01,250
Man,

878
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,170
you got to get my boy on worse.

879
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,300
The Joe Rogan experience.

880
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,300
That's a whole in there.

881
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,413
Hold that,

882
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,540
hold that.

883
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,390
Got Something and then,

884
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,300
okay.

885
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,133
Bye.

886
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,880
All right.

887
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,713
You're all right.

888
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,673
Don't worry.

889
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,690
Oh my God.

890
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,030
Yeah.

891
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,410
I say stop.

892
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:29,651

893
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:29,921

894
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:30,131

895
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:30,341

896
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:30,730

897
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,390
