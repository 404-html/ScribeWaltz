1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,210
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,740
two,
one.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,970
We're just talking about moving the
woods together.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,430
It just feels so good.
He'll tiny house with three pairs of

5
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:17,920
shoes.
Three pairs of pants.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,360
Maybe two shirts.
Yeah,

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,440
that's it.
The last clothing you'll ever buy.

8
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:24,910
One coat.
Yeah.

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,750
Everybody's just out here chasing bigger
and better.

10
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:29,560
Tom,
Papa,

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,590
just why?
Why I'm starting to wonder.

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,420
I was telling you guys that I was
looking at.

13
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:37,090
This house is for sale in northern
California.

14
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:39,570
In the redwoods.
It's 32 now.

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,040
Three hundred and 20 feet square.
Tiny ass.

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,160
The whole house has got a loft.
The loft is where you sleep in a tiny,

17
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,010
tiny thing.
Below it is like little tiny kitchen.

18
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,020
Yeah,
a little tiny couch area.

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,010
That's it.
Like a houseboat,

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,980
like with like built in thing.
It's Kinda like A.

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,163
Yeah,
yeah,

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,310
yeah.
They make those.

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,660
Now think about how simple your life
would be.

24
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,300
It would be,
but would you be content

25
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,590
that's very small?
You'd be great for a little while.

26
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,500
That's very small.
Three hundred 60.

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,753
Yeah.
That's.

28
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,720
I want to shower like that.
That,

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,770
that little tiny house.
No,

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,390
come on.
That's not the one that's bigger than

31
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:21,050
that.
That's a 320 foot.

32
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,890
It says three and a 20 foot tiny cabin
in big bear.

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,070
Oh my God.
That's attainable.

34
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,080
That's bigger than we need.
It's still for sale.

35
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,760
This video chip in today,
go put up last year,

36
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:38,510
320 foot tiny cabin in big bear.
Amazing Small House.

37
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,350
So I'm like,
aw,

38
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,310
you know,
we should do Jamie.

39
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,350
So simple.
We should buy that place and turn it

40
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:47,860
into our big bear studio.
That's what we should do to fucking

41
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:49,510
show.
I bet the shows up there.

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,300
I bet if we did a show in big bear in
the woods like that,

43
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:53,950
it would have a totally different feel
to it.

44
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,140
Yeah,
because you'd be hearing your guests

45
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:59,020
screaming in the background,
being mauled by mountain lions,

46
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,350
but if he did do a show up there,
how the fuck would you convince people

47
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:08,770
to drive two hours?
Could we get there?

48
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,780
People that are training up there or
something like that.

49
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:12,820
Maybe they could pop over here like four
guys.

50
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,280
Granada love getting Tito Ortiz occur
every day and then you'd be like,

51
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:18,971
okay,
I get it.

52
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:20,410
Hey Chuck Liddell.
I get it.

53
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,090
I get it.
Canelo's a pussy.

54
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:27,091
I get it.
I don't know.

55
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:29,800
I mean the fantasy is that that becomes
a simple life.

56
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,200
You pare down everything,
all the aggravation you get.

57
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,320
Maybe two bills come to the house will
go crazy.

58
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,020
If I didn't have a family,
it wouldn't be a problem.

59
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,050
If it was just single Joe,
no family,

60
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:43,510
no kids,
it wouldn't be a problem.

61
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,360
I would just go.
I mean I really probably think already I

62
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:50,020
would already have a place like that up
there where I could just go and chill.

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,960
Yeah,
I just that I was thinking of just the

64
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:56,500
little place like that,
like a little hideout next to the house

65
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,320
like Mark Twain had.
Did he have a place that

66
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,360
little octagon kind of a room and he
would leave his house with his daughters

67
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:10,690
and his wife and he would go up the
steps and go into his little thing on

68
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:15,670
this table was just his pipe,
a box of cigars,

69
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,520
his writing pads,
his pens,

70
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,320
and he just would hang out there and
smoke all day and work and then he would

71
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,950
go back home and maybe that's enough.
Maybe that cuts the edge off.

72
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,370
It gives you your isolation and your
simplicity and then you return back to

73
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:36,160
the people you have to feed.
It's a little something that'll work.

74
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:37,780
If you've got the people you have to
feed.

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,080
If you don't have to feed straight
Woodsboro oh yeah.

76
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,970
Caught up path.
Well,

77
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:45,160
that's going to be the real trick.
When the kids leave,

78
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:48,250
when they get big enough and they take
off and it's just Bam to you and your

79
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,470
wife,
and then the wife ones get like five

80
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:53,710
dogs.
She's probably like encouraging you to

81
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:58,570
go get a cab and get another dog.
Rescue a dog.

82
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,590
Let's adopt a kid.

83
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,170
They want to keep you tethered.
Well tethered to little things.

84
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,310
They're the nestor.
Yep.

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,660
They were the nest.
They if they,

86
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,150
if the nest is empty,
that's their job.

87
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,810
They build that nest once everyone
wanted everyone in that nest safe and

88
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,230
that's what they're built to do you see?
Have you ever seen women that have like

89
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,760
a bunch of dogs when you go like,
you know,

90
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:20,110
you want a kid,
right?

91
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,280
Like the towel.
I just don't have the time for a kid.

92
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,630
Like how much time are you spending on
these fucking dogs?

93
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,450
Like it's probably pretty close now.
It's just me and my fluffy babies made

94
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,460
my mom and just fluffy babies.
But it.

95
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:38,920
But what is it about people that want to
further complicate their lives?

96
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,070
Like what is it?
Why?

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,670
Why does everybody always want bigger?
Is that just a part of the,

98
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,190
the genes?

99
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,990
Is that what it is?
Like what is it?

100
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,891
Well,
we have,

101
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:50,860
I think a drive in us to always do more,
explore more,

102
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:51,730
push more,
right.

103
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:54,730
There's something built into human
beings that have that and then we have a

104
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:59,340
system that rewards that in capitalism.
So that's the,

105
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,110
that's the,
that's the board game that we're all

106
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:05,230
playing,
so it keeps you racing to get more stuff

107
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:07,780
in bigger house and more things.
You know what I mean?

108
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,550
Like if there was,
if that didn't exist,

109
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:11,110
if you weren't able to accumulate that
stuff,

110
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:15,010
what would we be doing?
We'd still be striving but for other

111
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,750
stuff.
But this is our reality.

112
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:20,230
So the,
it manifests itself in more cars.

113
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,240
A bigger house,
you know,

114
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,030
they were optics.
You're always trying to survive.

115
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,300
But surviving is not that hard today.
Right.

116
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,370
Good point.
So you try to instead,

117
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,550
because it's not too complicated to go
find your food,

118
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,570
right.
There's not a lot of puzzles and

119
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,030
challenges.
Shelters taken care of.

120
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:44,560
So you start thinking,
you know what,

121
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,270
I just need a new car.
Cars two years old,

122
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,960
28 miles on it,
driving a car with 20

123
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,380
miles.
Smells like farts.

124
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,050
Yeah,
no,

125
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,130
it makes you.
Yeah,

126
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,190
you just keep going.
But then I think you do that long

127
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:10,190
enough.
You start to realize hopefully that that

128
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:12,520
stuff doesn't really make you happier.
It,

129
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,740
it does to an extent.
Like when you get out of your poor days

130
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,820
and you kinda like get above water and
you help your family out and you get

131
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:24,821
some stuff you're proud of,
but then you just are adding more stress

132
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,070
because you're bigger bills and bigger
taxes and all this stuff.

133
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:31,010
You've got to fill up it.
It actually does the opposite.

134
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:33,410
It makes you more stressed.
You're not as happy.

135
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,840
And then you got to kind of strike that
balance.

136
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,950
It seems like it's A.
Jim Carrey has been on this kick

137
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,100
explaining that to people because,
you know,

138
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:46,050
Jim Carey said,
I'm paraphrasing,

139
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,070
but basically his quote was,
I wish everybody would get rich and

140
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:55,730
famous and they would see that that's
not what makes you happy.

141
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,340
Right.
You know,

142
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,190
people think that,
hey,

143
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,790
if I was rich and famous,
yeah,

144
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,800
would be happy.
Yeah.

145
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,930
He said,
I wish that everyone would get rich and

146
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:04,910
famous so they'd realize that that's not
the answer.

147
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,120
Yeah.
What does he say is the answer he makes

148
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:11,900
to make paintings shitting on people,
mocking them.

149
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,490
That seems to make you.
Is that as art?

150
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:14,650
Yeah.
I know he paints.

151
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,750
I know.
Where's the peace and love,

152
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,850
Bro?
It's aggressive.

153
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,270
Paintings are all like shitting on
people mocking people.

154
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,780
Clearly assholes,
but I mean it's not like he's like

155
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,310
trying to accentuate the love in the
world.

156
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,670
He's just shitting all over these bad
people.

157
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,660
That makes them happy.
Yeah.

158
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,090
I mean,
I don't know.

159
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,650
Is that good?
Yeah.

160
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Is it good to focus on the bad people?
Like has anybody changed their opinion

161
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,280
based on Jim Carey's art?
Does anybody know?

162
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I was like a big jeff sessions fan right
till I saw these paintings and then with

163
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:57,341
Jim Carey's got him with a giant fucking
wart covered dick holding it out in

164
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:00,950
front of them.
Jizzing all over the constitution.

165
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,300
This little Yoda head.
Yeah.

166
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

167
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,240
I don't know.
That's always a question.

168
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,530
It's like how much,
how much of art that rails against

169
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:19,460
something is effective in changing that
thing you're railing against?

170
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,410
Like does it actually have an impact?
Is it a slow impact?

171
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,780
Does it change over time and pens in the
art?

172
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,250
Here's a.
here's an example.

173
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,460
I think Tina fey legitimately changed
the way people feel about Sarah Pailin.

174
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,630
I think she legitimately may have
affected the way people were willing to

175
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:45,941
accept Sarah Pailin or vote for because
her impression of her was so brilliant.

176
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,800
I don't know if people remember it.
Oh yeah.

177
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,430
It was so god damn good.
She looked exactly like it looked like

178
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,280
her attitude and she said things people
eventually

179
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,390
attributed to Sarah Pailin because they
thought that Sarah Pailin actually said

180
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:04,530
it because Tina face at it.
She fucking nailed it.

181
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,030
Did.
She's so funny.

182
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,660
Her show a timmy Kimmy Schmidt.
Have you seen that show?

183
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,860
Breakable.
Kimmy Schmidt.

184
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,470
It's one of my favorite show.
It's so good.

185
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,600
It's Tina fey show.
She's in it.

186
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:18,910
Sometimes she plays the lead is great.
Stick.

187
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,000
I mean,
get the fuck out of here.

188
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:24,360
That is so crazy.
We're right now the audio folks.

189
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:29,010
We're looking at an image of Tina Fey as
Sarah Pailin right next to Sarah Pailin

190
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,850
and it's fucking indistinguishable
almost.

191
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,720
It's so good,
but did she.

192
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,510
Do you think she affected people who
already liked Sarah Pailin?

193
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,700
They don't.
If you like Sarah Palin,

194
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,280
you don't know what you like.
You're out of your fucking mind.

195
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,020
Those people like Sarah Palin,
they were out of their fucking minds.

196
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,860
I mean,
they're basically working with a less

197
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:54,120
than functional brain.

198
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,900
You thought that that was a good idea
that that lady could be running things

199
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,290
like that close to being president.
She was a construct to,

200
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,610
you know,
she was an entertainer,

201
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,240
but not.
No,

202
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,170
but I mean Sarah Palin was a construct.
She wasn't what everybody thought.

203
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,960
She was like.
There was like,

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,250
there was one,
there's a story.

205
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:14,700
I am not hundred percent sure this is
true,

206
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:19,650
but it makes sense that someone shot a
Caribou and then they drove her to the

207
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:23,580
Caribou that gave her the rifle and she
stood over the Caribou and took photos

208
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,470
so that they could show,
hey,

209
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:30,090
she's a hunter like us,
US regular folk out here hunting

210
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:31,800
Caribou.
Find out if that's true.

211
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,180
Just a public relations kind of thing.
You need to,

212
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,170
we need a google plus.
Believe it,

213
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,340
you know.
Yeah,

214
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:39,270
of course,
you know,

215
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,340
that's all.
That's the way all that stuff is due,

216
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,690
I believe because I want to believe it.
My announceable.

217
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,750
Um,
maybe she just,

218
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,550
I wouldn't say you're an asshole,
but a good woman.

219
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,873
Yeah.
Hey look,

220
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,200
she was the governor of Alaska.
That's easy.

221
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:55,460
I can be the government lab for two.
She had showbiz.

222
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,800
Okay.
Sarah Caribou after missing five times

223
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,760
showing shooting Caribou on the latest
episode of a Reality Television show.

224
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,643
Okay.
Yeah.

225
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,420
What's amazing is how that she really
fell off.

226
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,290
Like,
wait a minute,

227
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,640
she's just shooting it freehand.
She doesn't have a rest.

228
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,953
Okay.

229
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,320
Why?
Why would you do that?

230
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,103
Okay,
let me see.

231
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,260
Show this.
Let me see how she does it.

232
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,310
Okay.
This is fucking stupid.

233
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,210
Listen folks,
the only reason to do this,

234
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,810
does she have a rest shut?
She's free handing this.

235
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,090
How?
Okay.

236
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,500
Look at the.
Got The packs on it and now she's going

237
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:36,780
to rest it.
Hm?

238
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,560
They said a tiny little Caribou to that
care.

239
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,850
That's why the Caribou is still around.
He's just firing.

240
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,880
That's,
that's a juvenile Caribou and she hasn't

241
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:46,380
shot yet.
Let's see what we got.

242
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,640
And she has.
Yeah,

243
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,100
went down.
She took some shots.

244
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,730
Oh,
she took.

245
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,290
Took some shots and missed.
Yeah,

246
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,300
that's why.
So she freehanded at first and then she

247
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:57,580
needed a rest.
She should have used arrest immediately

248
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:02,830
and I've have shot animals freehanding,
but not never far away.

249
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:07,030
I shot a moose at 60 yards free trial,
a free hand in it because you're not as

250
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:07,864
accurate.

251
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,070
W with a bow?
Well,

252
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,890
a bose more accurate.
Honestly,

253
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,890
a bow,
a more accurate with a bow at like 60,

254
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:19,390
70 yards.
Freehand.

255
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,320
Not more accurate,
but in the range that I am with a rifle

256
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,630
with a rifle.
When you get out you could shoot

257
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,570
accurately on arrest,
like way out longer distances.

258
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,670
But when you're just holding it up like
that,

259
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,100
it's based on.
I mean you've got to kind of lock it

260
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:36,090
into your body,
but it's hard to but isn't a bucket

261
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,190
steady now bought.
The thing is about the tension of the

262
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,380
bow.
Your arm is kind of locked out in the

263
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:44,140
tension of the bow.
You could keep your arm pretty fucking

264
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:48,140
steady and I practice it everyday like
that.

265
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:51,180
So practicing keeping my arm very steady
everyday.

266
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,100
So all these stabilizer muscles in my
shoulder are very strong.

267
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,190
And having a gun out there,
it's just like let's just a little so

268
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,210
and also the recoil if you're not used
to shooting and it doesn't look like

269
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:02,100
she's used to shooting the.

270
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,970
She didn't immediately go for the rest,
like a seasoned hunter would have either

271
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:11,971
lane prone or throw their pack down
immediately put that rifle over it and

272
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:14,770
settle in.
So rifles resting on something.

273
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,850
Gotcha.
You know.

274
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,010
But a lot of times they'll bring like
sticks but they pod fail somewhere

275
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,710
making a reality show for Tlc.
See.

276
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
But what I've read though,
that there was a photo shoot,

277
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:28,660
they did see it,
see if you can find this fake.

278
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:31,930
Do you think that the thing is fake?
Well they just put a circle around them,

279
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,170
but that's just for the,
for the filming.

280
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,660
The caribou definitely went down.
Yeah.

281
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:41,140
But I mean I don't think she shot it and
it went down.

282
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,520
I think it's most likely she shot it and
it went down because you see the way

283
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:47,260
she's reacting and everybody else's
reacting.

284
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,430
That seems pretty real to me.

285
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,690
Like,
it's not impossible.

286
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:52,570
Shoot an animal,
especially that's a juvenile Caribou,

287
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,850
that she how old their antlers are.
He's like,

288
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,960
hey guys,
what are you doing?

289
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,330
This is what you would call it.
Like if that was an elk,

290
00:13:58,331 --> 00:13:59,920
you'd call that a spike.
Hey look,

291
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,860
it's people.
I'm just thinking about the production

292
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,960
here.
Like there's one camera on her and then

293
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,990
there's one behind them,
but that means that,

294
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,930
that then have a third that's focused
just on the animal and that means

295
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:12,520
there's three camera guys out there with
them.

296
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:14,480
That's just sounds like a lot.
Yeah.

297
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,760
And the camera is like,
Hey,

298
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:18,010
I'm going to be on TV.
That's a good point.

299
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:21,220
They might have recreated the shot.
It's bomb.

300
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,660
It's possible.
Yeah.

301
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,370
It's,
you know what man?

302
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,540
The reality is whenever you're dealing
with air quote reality shows,

303
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,310
there's massive fuckery involved and
editing and please,

304
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,390
but uh,
back to whether you could affect it,

305
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,480
whether or not the art can affect what
you think.

306
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,580
Yeah.
I mean,

307
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:46,150
what trump did during the election,
he like calling people out and mocking

308
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,540
them.
He really thinks that art it,

309
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,560
that's not her,
but he was kind of like a,

310
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,980
like a long island

311
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,050
comedian,
like a insult comic,

312
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,390
you know,
it was just like going after these guys.

313
00:14:56,391 --> 00:15:00,230
Crazy Ted and little water guy and I
mean he was doing.

314
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,410
It was very much entertainment lion,
ted,

315
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,880
crazy.
Hillary,

316
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,080
crazy.
Bernie,

317
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,900
crooked hillary and Hillary and crazy.
Bernie's going to defend.

318
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:11,380
Teddy said at a big rally defendant.
Yeah,

319
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:13,850
he stays for what?
For the Texas?

320
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,360
Uh,
things in what you're talking about,

321
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,650
pat.
I'll pull it up right now.

322
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,610
This isn't a race right now with the.
I forget the guy's name.

323
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:24,800
Is Betty overwork or patio.
Now pull it up.

324
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,960
Okay.
So He's defending him.

325
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:28,430
In what way?
He's going to have a big route.

326
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:31,660
He's gonna hold a big rally for
Pocahontas.

327
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,740
Is that after they talked so much shit
about each other,

328
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:36,990
then they go cruise.
So he said yeah,

329
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:39,870
after he says his father was killed
Kennedy or something.

330
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,570
Zodiac killer.
We're doing a major rally for Senator

331
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:47,090
Ted Cruz in October.
I'm picking the biggest stadium in

332
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,140
texts.
Fine.

333
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:49,370
As you know,
ted,

334
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:53,030
as my complete and total endorsement,
I like how he was endorsing with a

335
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:56,930
capital e.
his opponent is a disaster for Texas

336
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:58,820
week on Second Amendment Crime,
borders,

337
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:00,410
military and vets.
He's,

338
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,930
you know,
there was an article yesterday showing

339
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,040
all the Times that trump has been lying.
It's stunning.

340
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,710
But one of the more recent ones was,
uh,

341
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,050
he was,
he did,

342
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:16,310
uh,
an interview where he was talking about

343
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,670
God dammit,
Lester Holt,

344
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,600
Lester Holt.
That's right.

345
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,510
It was Lester Holt and you know,
he was saying that they fudged that

346
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:27,380
interview and it costs them badly.
And so then they played the transcript.

347
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,390
They wrote,
they showed the transcript of the

348
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:31,190
interview.
They released the full interview.

349
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,900
Like there's no fudging.
No.

350
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:34,070
It just played it as is.

351
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,720
You're like,
what are you talking about?

352
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:36,951
Yeah,
he,

353
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:39,810
but he,
he said that he's.

354
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,710
He says,
what you saw is not real.

355
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,840
The truth is not the truth.
Well,

356
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,320
that was what Giuliani said.
Yeah.

357
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,840
But that's.
But that's what.

358
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,210
They're just.
Nothing's real.

359
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,210
Except what I tell you his real well,
I just think that they've realized that

360
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:57,500
there's a certain percentage of the
people that are with them that just need

361
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:01,460
some wiggle room.
They just need somewhere or argue they

362
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:04,250
just need some consideracy threat.
They're not thinkers.

363
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,730
They just need a little bit of something
that they could run with and use to

364
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:11,420
argue.
So if comedians come out and attack

365
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,850
trump and you know,
there's comics that are,

366
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,260
you know,
Bill Maher and all these people that

367
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:18,230
come out and really go against them.
Does it have any effect?

368
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,240
It has an effect.
It does for sure.

369
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,140
I think Alec Baldwin has the most effect
that,

370
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,070
that impressed.
He doesn't impression of him.

371
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,750
That oppression is brilliant.
He

372
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,220
makes trump angry to trump,
keeps shitting on him.

373
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,860
He keeps watching it.
He can't stop watching it.

374
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,110
That alone has an effect.
Yeah,

375
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,140
but it's not.
It's like I've never seen a time where

376
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:45,410
people are more angry at the press and
like,

377
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:49,680
uh,
going along with the conspiracy thread

378
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:54,030
of the deep state,
the deep state trying to take out the

379
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,470
potus.
I love what they call them.

380
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:57,630
Potus too.
It's fucking Donald Trump.

381
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,410
Stop.
No,

382
00:17:59,440 --> 00:17:59,671
no,
no,

383
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:01,410
no.
Potus is this and that.

384
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:02,940
He's going to do this.
Including the swamp.

385
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:05,370
Like what?
Donald trump.

386
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,590
Why?
Why are you saying Potus?

387
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,630
Just say if you want to say trump,
that's fine.

388
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,850
You want to say president trump?
That's fine too.

389
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,220
You want to call them potus.
You're doing some sneaky shit.

390
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,210
I'm not sure what you're doing.
Like anytime you use codewords,

391
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,060
I'm out.
Likely you're doing agent 99 minus.

392
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,670
Get outta here with potus.
Potus.

393
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:31,620
How he wears a hat that says 45 on
45th.

394
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:34,650
President had his own hats made.
Who the fuck?

395
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,360
One of the presidents had hats made.
He has merged excelon merge.

396
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:43,090
After the show,
I'm going to be signing in the lobby in

397
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:45,330
the lobby.
I got painted caps.

398
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:48,750
Bumper stickers like looking for a gift.
Is this the trump?

399
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,260
This is a good way to get assaulted.
Positional merchant.

400
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,340
If you just wear one of these and a
Vegan restaurant,

401
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,690
you're sure to get punched
this scene.

402
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,010
Oh my God.
Guys going to get indicted.

403
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,630
The guy that pulled the hat off of some
kids and threw a drink on them in a

404
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,260
water water burgers.
I would.

405
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:07,380
It was the guy in Texas.
Yeah.

406
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:10,430
Some um,
some dude saw some there.

407
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,010
He's got the 45 hats.
Whole areas official.

408
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:19,290
It's only $185 to $50,000 by a stupid
time.

409
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,280
It's unsafe to be 28.
Now it's 1680.

410
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,180
You can get my DVD.
You can get a bike,

411
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,090
you can get a digital download of my
speech tonight and you go from $28 to

412
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:35,550
1680.
Like I want to be in the room with that

413
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:40,551
conversation.
Do you want to charge 1738 and no less?

414
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,470
I'll tell you.
16 92 close to 17.

415
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,300
$40.
Oh,

416
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,850
it just says USA.
It must be a good seller.

417
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,090
USA.
Does it get that trademark back?

418
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,080
That is fucking hilarious.
40th five in the side.

419
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,090
Tromping back $40 for a hat date.
If they find that you bought that,

420
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:10,521
they put you on a very special list of
morons that they count on whenever

421
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:13,220
there's a rally.
Like if they're going to like have a,

422
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,560
like a fake hillary in a jail cell and
they're gonna throw her,

423
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:20,370
threw a parade.
Like have her on a cart and carrier

424
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:22,170
threw a parade.
Oh Man.

425
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,260
You don't want president pence.
Listen,

426
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,700
you know,
I mean,

427
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,240
people that are not happy with trump got
understand.

428
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,460
You get him out.
It's not like you get Hillary in.

429
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,470
This doesn't work that way.
It doesn't come out of the hallway.

430
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,830
Yeah.
I don't know.

431
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,400
Wouldn't you rather have pens?
Um,

432
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,960
I know people say that,
but I just want,

433
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,180
that's somewhat normal.
I want someone that whole pants is not

434
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,540
normal.
You see what Ben Ben Shapiro wrote,

435
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,880
he put a tweet up with a picture of the
lady from the handmaid's tale when deep

436
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,070
trouble and he wrote,
prepare for pence.

437
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,770
Fucking religious nut over the top won't
be alone in a room with a woman.

438
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,140
Yeah.
How about Romney?

439
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,020
I just saw him on Jay Leno's show.
He seems like a reasonable car.

440
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,970
It looks very presidential.
Cool.

441
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,800
President hair.
I gotta be honest.

442
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:26,290
He seems.
Romney seems like a reasonable man.

443
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,210
Seems kind.
He seems like he respects.

444
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,660
He's a natural.
He's a nutty Mormon for sure.

445
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,720
You know why?
Because all Mormons are nutty.

446
00:21:33,721 --> 00:21:35,560
More than just being a mormons.
Nutty.

447
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,750
They changed the name.
You don't call them Mormons anymore.

448
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,790
Talking about that yesterday they
rebranded.

449
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,570
Calling them a mormon.
It's like calling a small person.

450
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:44,320
Image.
Midget.

451
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,890
Oh,
is it?

452
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,910
Yes.
So a compliment.

453
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,710
No,
I keep forgetting what to call him.

454
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,920
Adorable or so.
Not Pc.

455
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,020
Are you on twitter?
Good luck.

456
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,520
You need to get on PC.
Twitter.

457
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,770
Hey,
can I announce my new show?

458
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,240
No,
come on.

459
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,280
No,
it's not worth it.

460
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:06,450
It's big.
No,

461
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,870
it's too dangerous.
You spawned it.

462
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,450
You're taking a chance.
Why are you doing this?

463
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:12,970
I know,
right,

464
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:15,610
exactly.
I'll be fired before it starts.

465
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,150
He announced the show on Rogan and then
it was canceled by the time he got off.

466
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,760
They were talking about midgets.
They're assholes and Mormons are

467
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:29,080
wonderful people.
It's true.

468
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,550
Once you have a boss.
Yeah.

469
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,230
No,
my show starts Monday night.

470
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,550
The bread show?
Yeah.

471
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,750
What's it called?
Baked.

472
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,130
Ooh,
I like it.

473
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,900
It's baked.
Look at that.

474
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,423
Handsome.
You look,

475
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,750
it started here,
Joe.

476
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,850
The whole thing started here.
Smile.

477
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,710
It's like I'm happy,
but you know,

478
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,760
pretty serious about bread.
The real reason I do that.

479
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,530
I look awful.
What I just showed my teeth.

480
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,290
Hey,
you look great.

481
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,330
I got this weird joker smile.

482
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,860
Now you've don't do it if you just
embrace it.

483
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,750
I called that bread behind you.
I know.

484
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,110
Isn't that amazing?
I'm in Ketosis right now.

485
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,480
Well,
I knew that the show,

486
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,230
the show starts this Monday night at
10:00 east and we were doing New York

487
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:14,050
and Detroit.
Jim Gaffigan joins me in the New York

488
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:15,940
one.
It's all very cool.

489
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,460
So every Monday through September,
all because of this show.

490
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,580
And you're bad ass fans.
Honestly.

491
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:25,150
That is why this is happening because I
talked about bread on this show.

492
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,480
That's fucking great man.
But I knew you were in a,

493
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,830
probably in Quito and.
But you know,

494
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:32,600
I always like to bring a tree.
What's this?

495
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,100
I didn't want to uh,
come empty handed.

496
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,710
So sticks of butter.
It's for Murphy.

497
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,180
Oh,
it's bone marrow.

498
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,190
It's elk.
Oh my goodness.

499
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:44,770
So elk antlers for.
Can I eat this?

500
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,160
You can't know it

501
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,180
all gets for Murphy.
Marshall.

502
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,240
Marshall.
I thought it was.

503
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,840
He'll go crazy with these.
Yeah,

504
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,660
they're a.
that's like one of those.

505
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,540
My dog went crazy over those.
Did you ever give.

506
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,860
Give you dog?
Yeah,

507
00:23:57,861 --> 00:23:59,240
he's got one at home right now.
Yeah.

508
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,550
He's got some sort of an antler but
loves it.

509
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,100
They go crazy,
but just chew all the marrow out

510
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,030
overtime.
You look so happy when you're with your

511
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:08,751
dog.
Oh,

512
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:10,850
I love that.
Don't you look so happy.

513
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:13,670
He's just a pure joy and the dog looks
happy.

514
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,930
He loves running and you know,
you can get a dog out in nature.

515
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,580
He's so and he's like the best dog I've
ever had in terms of like listening and

516
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:25,700
coming to you and always checking to
make sure that because he's a retriever

517
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,370
know,
so he's like super in tune with you.

518
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,890
He's,
he's so fun to like.

519
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,030
When I come home the first thing he
does,

520
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:33,360
he sees me,
wags his tail.

521
00:24:33,361 --> 00:24:36,350
It comes up to me and then he runs,
grabs a toy,

522
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,390
puts in his mouth and then comes back to
me like he's retrieving something.

523
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,950
He has these instincts to bring
something to me.

524
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,530
My black lab has the same thing,
same thing.

525
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,890
I always feel bad that if I don't have
time to like play and start tugging with

526
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:51,620
her because she's just like,
you're here,

527
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:52,454
let's go,
let's play,

528
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,950
let's do when you don't have to work and
you get on the phone or whatever.

529
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,330
And they just like lay on the ground.
Like

530
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,890
I came home or an adult the other night
at like 1:00 in the morning from the

531
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:05,220
comedy store.
And uh,

532
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,440
I sat on the couch to start writing and
a marshall just comes over and goes to

533
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,600
what's going on,
what do we do?

534
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,810
And it's like,
like a roommate,

535
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,420
like what's happening in Europe.
It's crazy.

536
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:16,460
Everybody else is asleep.
They've been asleep.

537
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,160
He's just gonna fuck around the laptop.
All right.

538
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:21,620
I'm gonna lie down right here.
I just slide down.

539
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,690
It's the best.
There is a great feeling when you're

540
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:25,960
writing and the dog is right next door,
right?

541
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,170
So fucking far tit.
You like,

542
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,630
Whoa,
dude.

543
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,680
You eat a rat outside or something would
happen.

544
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,960
I hope he enjoys the elk.
Thank you,

545
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:36,800
man.
That's awesome.

546
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:37,760
You're welcome.
Yeah,

547
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:40,510
he's the best best talking about Rod.
Well,

548
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,970
Johnny cash was an awesome dog to.
Let's look at that face.

549
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,650
He's just lying on his.
Yeah.

550
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,840
So happy.
He's such a happy dog.

551
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,480
Yeah,
my dog would be happy like that.

552
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:53,060
If I could find some good trails.
I don't have good trails.

553
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,310
I just take them to a runyon or
something.

554
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,030
You know,
he.

555
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,650
Can he just run up runyon?
Yeah.

556
00:25:57,651 --> 00:25:59,540
You just got to be careful of other
people's dogs.

557
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:02,350
Like Marshall got bit by one.
Someone's dog wants.

558
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,030
Some people just have dogs that just are
not that well.

559
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:05,990
Uh,
you know,

560
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,870
socialize.
Yeah.

561
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,221
Yeah.
But if you,

562
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:09,911
uh,
you know,

563
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:14,210
you have a model leash for the most part
or you find a good spot where you don't

564
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:15,950
have to have them on leash and that's
great.

565
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,690
It's just,
that's what I want to do.

566
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,720
Other dogs or the issue and snakes who
rattlesnakes rouse thinks you have to be

567
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:24,830
very careful around,
around us.

568
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,780
Out here.
You guys go up,

569
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:29,300
you're running dog gets bit by a
rattlesnake.

570
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,890
Take A.
you're a quarter mile from base camp.

571
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:34,970
It'll be okay.
Dogs be way better off than people can

572
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,030
run back with him.
Yeah.

573
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:38,460
Yeah.
You take them back home.

574
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,390
I mean,
I might have to carry them because it's

575
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,770
really steep.
The stuff that we run on is like

576
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,420
literally like super fucking Steve.
Oh yeah,

577
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,970
yeah.
It's uh,

578
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,850
it's basically the last three quarters
of a mile.

579
00:26:51,851 --> 00:26:53,670
It's all uphill who?
Yeah.

580
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,190
And it's fucking brutal,
but it's great on the legs,

581
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:57,550
in the ass.
Fill my ass,

582
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,630
my ass.
Happy Labor Day.

583
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,630
But I thought when you got hit by a
Rambler,

584
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:06,090
you're supposed to like not move.
Now you got to get out of there.

585
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,070
You've got to get to medical attention.
You got to go.

586
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,960
What it does is,
here's the thing,

587
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,900
you can't suck the venom out.
This is what people think.

588
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:13,831
People Think,
oh,

589
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:17,760
you just cut it and suck the venom out.
This is what rattlesnake venom does.

590
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,740
What it does is it digests your skin,
it digest your flesh.

591
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,650
The venom does.
Yes,

592
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:24,960
it causes necrosis.

593
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:30,260
So would it would essentially is doing
is digesting you with venom and this is

594
00:27:31,111 --> 00:27:35,580
the way they kill rabbits and things
with the eat and swallow.

595
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,230
They bite them and then they kill them.
Does Venom and it starts to digest the

596
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:45,231
flesh and then they swallow it whole and
it aids in their processing of this

597
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:46,500
animal who.
Wait a minute.

598
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,040
So the snake hits a rat.
Yep.

599
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,990
If he were to take his mouth off after
five minutes,

600
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,570
would it have been partially digested?
Is that what you're saying?

601
00:27:57,571 --> 00:28:00,780
That literally starts,
starts digesting.

602
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,520
Yeah.
It starts,

603
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,960
it starts decomposing and digesting.
So when you get bit by a Rattlesnake,

604
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,590
a lot of times you need massive skin
grafts and um,

605
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,540
you have massive tissue loss.
And necrosis is one guy documented.

606
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,970
He got bit on the arm and they had a med
vac amount and the helicopter.

607
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,970
And then he had to go through a long
series of operations to repair his arm.

608
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:30,580
She's like Mesh and skin grafts.
And all these different things and it

609
00:28:30,581 --> 00:28:34,500
still was fucked up.
Like years later his arm is fucked up so

610
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:36,540
he didn't get medical attention.
Why would you die?

611
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,280
Well,
like what?

612
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:42,350
It would just spread through organs.
Don't exactly know you.

613
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:47,370
You might survive a rattlesnake bite if
you're going to get medical attention if

614
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:51,240
it wasn't the most amount of venom.
The real scary thing as young ones.

615
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,390
Young young rattle snakes just empty out
on you.

616
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,420
Just like young boys,
you know first like,

617
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,640
Whoa,
where's all this coming from?

618
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,830
Even storing it up.
You don't know how to control it.

619
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,220
The that's how it is with the older one
trap.

620
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,860
Like 80 year old man.

621
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,260
Have you ever know the difference
between like an 18 year old fella

622
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,830
shooting arc as Bill Hicks would say?
Arking ropes of Judaism versus a

623
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,870
rattlesnake that's like thick.
Like a fucking.

624
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,380
Like a tree trunk.
Yeah.

625
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,840
Those.
I ran over one month.

626
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,880
This was crazy.
I was running with my,

627
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:38,100
not the last dogs that are deceased,
but my dogs before that,

628
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,580
when I used to have pit bulls and we ran
over what I thought was a a large stick

629
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,500
in the road and the trail,
and as I'm running over it in the air,

630
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,850
I realize it is a giant rattlesnake.
Oh,

631
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,100
thick.
As my former.

632
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,870
Oh my God,
it was huge.

633
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,900
Seven feet long.
He's just in the middle of the trail,

634
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,480
just completely stretched out like a
stick.

635
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,690
Oh my God.
Just sunning itself and the dogs ran

636
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:07,480
right over it and it didn't strike you
to just know.

637
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,310
The dog's luckily listened to me and
they weren't aware that it was,

638
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:16,390
but those dogs were crazy.
Those dogs had been bitten three times.

639
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,820
Oh my God.
My dogs have been bitten three times by

640
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:20,710
snakes,
so they knew they just killed the

641
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:21,850
snakes.
They didn't give a fuck.

642
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,720
Pitfalls are so crazy.
They're the craziest dogs.

643
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,080
They're so hard wired for combat.
Like the rattle snake was in the paper.

644
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:32,350
It was like,
fuck

645
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:39,670
that killed him.
They didn't even worry for a second that

646
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,350
he got bit in the face at one time.
He got hit,

647
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,390
bitten the face.
He got bitten.

648
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,830
The face of.
This is Frank Sinatra.

649
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,920
Is there a name that time he named the
dogs.

650
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,940
The craziest dog I've ever had.
A dog killed everything he could.

651
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,020
His main game was I leave him in the
yard and he tried to kill lizards,

652
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,033
his main games.

653
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,500
It was like a video game who just walk
around the yard,

654
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,440
stomping on the grass,
looking for lizards,

655
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,190
dive on.
It was like,

656
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,400
it was like a game to him.
Just trying to find lizards to kill.

657
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,710
How was he with people?
He was wonderful with people.

658
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,580
Was a sweet,
sweet.

659
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,290
Never strike out.
Go after a person.

660
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,101
No,
no.

661
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:13,570
He never been a person.
He was.

662
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:18,580
He was a little aggressive with his like
he wanted to play and it will freak

663
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:21,610
people out because he would like to play
and pull ropes with you.

664
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:24,520
Like he'd want to grab a rope and bring
it to you and have you pull on it and he

665
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:26,670
would make these horrific noises.
So you'd.

666
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:31,740
You'd be pulling it
and people were like,

667
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,220
what the fuck man?
I'm like,

668
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:35,230
he's just playing.
He's a sweet dog.

669
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,830
Let go.
Give him a cruise with quantum,

670
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,090
blah,
blah,

671
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:38,330
blah.

672
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,070
Right,
right.

673
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,530
Crazy kisses.
But he was so.

674
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,960
They get a bad rap though.
They deserve it.

675
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,880
They deserve it.
They deserve it.

676
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,190
They deserve because you don't know if
you're just walking down the street and

677
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:51,640
you see a pit bull off leash.
People should be cautious.

678
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,390
People don't want to hear that because
they love their dog.

679
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,850
My dog is different.
Don't say that they are bred to fight.

680
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,190
That's what they're bred for.
That's where they came from.

681
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:01,190
That's where the breed.
Yup.

682
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,720
No bullshit.
The reason why there's such great dogs

683
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,770
is because they're bred the good ones,
at least to have no aggression

684
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:11,710
whatsoever towards people so that when
the dogs are fighting,

685
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,520
they could go in and separate them with
no fear of the dogs turning on the.

686
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:19,660
On the owner.
Interesting where they do this.

687
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,260
Ireland,
America,

688
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,560
but America.
That's.

689
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,170
What do you think?

690
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,450
American pit bull.
That's what it's called.

691
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,270
American pit bull terrier.
What do you think the Michael Vick thing

692
00:32:28,271 --> 00:32:29,490
was all about?
Right.

693
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,540
There's a been around for a long time
though.

694
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,240
I haven't been over 100 years or a
couple hundred years,

695
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,230
but the,
you know,

696
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,680
that was originally going to be our
national animal before they went with

697
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:43,790
the Eagle.
Ben Franklin sell the Eagle.

698
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,640
I don't know.
I didn't even notice the idea.

699
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,320
It was who wanted the pitbull.
I Dunno.

700
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,630
I mean they use it as war dogs when they
use them in,

701
00:32:51,631 --> 00:32:53,690
in the army.
How would have been a cool symbol?

702
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,660
Sort of.
But you know the,

703
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:59,840
the,
the problem with those dogs is multifold

704
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,840
one,
they have a very high prey drive.

705
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,910
Like they're their drive to attack
things is very high and the more they're

706
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:09,980
bred for that,
the better.

707
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,520
The more intelligent they are,
the more intense they are and people

708
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:17,300
love them because of their intensity and
their intelligence and their loyalty

709
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:20,420
towards their owners is outrageous so
that love is deep.

710
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,990
That's why.
That's why the pimple people,

711
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,720
because they really do.
If you say anything,

712
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:27,520
do they get really up in arms about it?
They just,

713
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,610
they don't want them to have a bad rap,
but I love those dogs.

714
00:33:31,611 --> 00:33:34,550
Don't get me wrong,
but one of my dogs killed one of my

715
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:35,870
other dogs.
Oh really?

716
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,310
Yes.
Oh my God.

717
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:39,510
Yeah.
You can't have two female pit bulls.

718
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,880
You can't have that two females.
They'll just go and just.

719
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,970
They never sorted out.
They never decide who the bosses.

720
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,730
They decided that they start off like
they'll,

721
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:54,230
they'll figure they'll have a fight and
then one will win and then you say,

722
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:56,810
okay,
well in normal situation this one

723
00:33:56,811 --> 00:34:01,260
realizes that it's the Alpha and then
the other one will back off and no

724
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,470
fucking way that with girls they won't
quit.

725
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,750
Girls never quit to go back to it.

726
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,730
What if one of them was hanging out with
Marshall?

727
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,200
Other?
You'd be fine.

728
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,780
That'd be fine.
She was fine with my male dogs.

729
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,460
It was.
It was a female dog.

730
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:16,610
She wanted other females around.
She was not fine with my mails.

731
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:19,070
If the mail was getting attention and
she wasn't,

732
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:22,670
she would get angry like,
you're stealing my attention as well.

733
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:25,250
She was a prison dog.
She was.

734
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,440
She was in the lab animal shelter for
many months.

735
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,880
When I got to Brian Collins wanted to
talk to me and again,

736
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:31,371
he goes,
dude,

737
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:32,540
you got to get this dog.
He goes,

738
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:34,070
I can't get her.
My yards too small.

739
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,510
He goes,
dog is so amazing.

740
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:36,950
So sweet.
And I went to see her and she was the

741
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:41,951
sweetest dog to people.
Was it a puppy still or still got her?

742
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,690
Yeah,
she's still a puppy,

743
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,900
but she was amazing,
but they're just fucking dangerous

744
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:48,800
around dogs.

745
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,020
Yeah.
My sister had a uh,

746
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,520
a bull mastiff.
Oh,

747
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:54,170
those are great.
Great Dogs.

748
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,430
That's so kind to people's like loving,
like you put them with children.

749
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,460
I mean it's a big dog.
It's head as like our heads combined,

750
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,690
but other dogs,
other small dogs really it was bred for

751
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:10,610
that and it would go and just any dog on
a leash with an old lady attached did

752
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:13,010
not care and just pin it to the ground.
Oh,

753
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,020
that's awesome.
And you just couldn't get it out.

754
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:18,950
I mean that just in the breed.
I had a dog that was a massive that just

755
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:22,820
died and I just had him.
His name is Johnny Cash.

756
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,890
We just had to put them down when walk
anymore.

757
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,870
He was 13 and I'm like,
this is the saddest moment.

758
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:34,040
Like the last week of his life,
Marshall was in the pool and he was

759
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,780
jumping around and playing with my
daughters.

760
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,020
Nobody's having a good time and Johnny
wanted to come to the pool but he

761
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:42,780
couldn't walk over there and so he
would.

762
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,930
It would take a couple steps and you'll
be panting and his legs would be shaken

763
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,930
and cable take a couple steps and he's
panting and his legs shake and he was

764
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:53,530
just in agony.
So I picked him up all 140 pounds of

765
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,990
tons of big dog.
Every time I run man,

766
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,690
I start coughing.
I ran this morning and then for the rest

767
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,820
of the day I'm like,
when I try to talk,

768
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,340
I got like your throat.
It's the,

769
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:09,210
it's the dirt.
I'm breathing in dust and pollen and I'm

770
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:11,700
in the bottom of these canyons,
running through all this shit and the

771
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:16,701
dogs in front of me kicking up dirt.
I'm Iran on the concrete today and I'm

772
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,850
making.
My point is I carried them so I had to

773
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:25,320
carry them over to the pool and I,
I sat down there and he just laid down

774
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:27,050
there and he was smiling and pants.

775
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,960
He was totally deaf by the time he died,
like completely deaf.

776
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,550
Acute would be lying there.
You'd be like,

777
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:33,690
Johnny,
you hungry?

778
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,250
Johnny?
And then he touched me like,

779
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:36,780
well where'd you come from?
Oh really?

780
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,580
Bummer about big dogs.
They die so well.

781
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,960
13 is not that bad.
It was amazing.

782
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,030
They actually died at like nine,
eight,

783
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:46,200
nine.
They're ready to go.

784
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:47,790
And what?
So I can't.

785
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,190
My dog's about 80 pounds.
And uh,

786
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,560
you know,
it's a big presence.

787
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,710
One hundred and 40,
that's a big thing in your house.

788
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:58,080
And to know that it's,
you fall deeply in love with it and then

789
00:36:58,081 --> 00:37:00,390
it's gonna be gone in six,
seven years.

790
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:01,470
It's hard.
It's hard.

791
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,280
It's hard.
If he was the sweetest dog tag,

792
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,310
everybody,
dogs,

793
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:09,420
people,
everybody just does the giant lovable

794
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,210
recently had to put him down.
Oh yeah,

795
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,990
a couple of weeks ago.

796
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,350
I'm sorry.
That's.

797
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,363
That's.
Yeah,

798
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,630
it was rough,
but it is rough,

799
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,840
but it was really hard seeing him
suffer.

800
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,190
Like when I try to bring them in.
Well,

801
00:37:21,191 --> 00:37:25,680
the last year was rough in the last
couple of months it was,

802
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:27,190
when do we do this?
It was like,

803
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,800
when do we,
when do we put them down because I don't

804
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:33,390
want to come home and find him dead,
but for a year we knew he was kind of a

805
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,390
slow deterioration,
like couldn't walk him anymore.

806
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,270
That was about two years ago.
Two years ago.

807
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:41,640
I just couldn't walk them because where
I live is a lot of hills.

808
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,180
You just couldn't do the hills.
He would just take a few steps and have

809
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:47,850
to breathe heavy and they take a few
steps and have to breathe heavy.

810
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,081
I was like,
God,

811
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:50,670
Jesus.
I didn't think he was going to last as

812
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:52,230
long as he did.
That's good.

813
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,680
That's a good life.
He was the best and that was a super

814
00:37:55,681 --> 00:38:00,000
sweet dog,
like always sweet and kind of like he

815
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:03,000
could be eating a steak and you can come
over to them and you could take the

816
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:06,820
steak from Louisville who would never
growl at you.

817
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,210
Right?
You let your dog in the pool.

818
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,560
Oh yeah,
yeah.

819
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,850
Why not?
I don't know.

820
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:13,980
I think it's going to be all wet and the
house.

821
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,630
Fuck out of here.
Dry them off,

822
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:17,940
bro.
Dogs love to get dried off.

823
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,840
When I.
When I.

824
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,270
When Marshall comes out of the pool,
I pulled a towel.

825
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:22,590
He was like,
Oh yes.

826
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,700
He comes over and I robbed them and he's
like,

827
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,690
Oh yeah,
chlorine or salt water,

828
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,040
salt
jobs it because I get one of them big

829
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:36,190
beach towels

830
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,960
and throw it over and I just start
rubbing them down.

831
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,000
Loves it.
He sees that towel.

832
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:43,240
He comes running in.
He's like massage time.

833
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,870
What about all the hair and the pool?
Yeah,

834
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:48,880
there's a lot of hair in the pool.
You have a scoop that up?

835
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

836
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:54,220
It comes in clumps.
Retrievers find it at the bottom and it

837
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:58,150
looks like algae growing on the bottom.
It's nasty hair.

838
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,560
I've been keeping my dog.
I've been keeping my dog of the man.

839
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:04,540
Why would you do that?
It's La.

840
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,550
It's hot as fuck.
Let the dog swim.

841
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:07,720
Jesus,
man.

842
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:10,110
Yeah.
Oh,

843
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,600
here in the pool because I take a
shower.

844
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,330
What are you worried about?
Water?

845
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,970
I don't know.
It seems like a pain in the ass here.

846
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:23,050
Dirty water.
The here's what about coloring?

847
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:24,580
Can I get that?
I'm a dog.

848
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:25,500
Skin.
Is that all right?

849
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:29,380
It's on your skin.
Just wash them off afterwards on down.

850
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,240
Why would you worry about the dog and
not yourself?

851
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,460
Jesus.
I only worry about myself and not the

852
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:36,360
dog.
Why don't you get a salt water thing for

853
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,760
your pool?
So yeah,

854
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,960
it's a whole rigmarole room.
Yeah,

855
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,150
but it's not that hard.
Now I know.

856
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,260
I got him.
I'm working on other projects.

857
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,810
Him.
He's just one of those guys that

858
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:49,730
dismisses important things in your life.
It's not true.

859
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:52,480
It's just that in the back.
So when I get high,

860
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:55,390
I think about it incessantly had fucks
with my head.

861
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,810
Is that what happens to me?
Yeah.

862
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,280
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

863
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:02,680
That's the number one thing.
We get high and then you realize,

864
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,900
oh,
I haven't been thinking about this at

865
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:06,190
all.
And then when you're high it's the only

866
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:07,060
thing you're thinking about.
Oh,

867
00:40:07,061 --> 00:40:07,894
for sure.

868
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,913
Things that I,
I,

869
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,440
you know,
should have been thinking about like a

870
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,080
year ago,
that sprinkler.

871
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,330
How much is that leaking water?
How much water is at league and what

872
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:21,010
have we run out of water?
Then I have to think about all the

873
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,890
sprinklers.
Brokenness.

874
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,900
I should just do it.
What's wrong with me?

875
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,950
Why can't I just make that goal to make
that call me out lately?

876
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,890
Emails.
There's no way I can keep up.

877
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:34,330
It's impossible.
Now at this point,

878
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,110
do you have a number that you try and
stay below in your inbox?

879
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,730
No.
That's how I do it.

880
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,680
If I can stay,
if I,

881
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:44,290
if I'm under 75,
I know I'm a,

882
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,480
I'm on top of it.
Seventy five.

883
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:48,290
I'm gonna.
Show you something that's fucking hair.

884
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,700
Spin
that number.

885
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,400
Where are we?
Upper left,

886
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,580
4,000,
655 in one account.

887
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,100
Good luck with those.
Is that also your garbage account?

888
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,230
That's just.
You're.

889
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,750
No,
you're good man.

890
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,820
No 1000 emails.
What?

891
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,050
Yeah,
exactly.

892
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,330
What are you doing that to yourself?
How are you going to do that?

893
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:11,590
It doesn't weigh on you.
Nope.

894
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,730
Come on.
Nope.

895
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,370
Doesn't feel like a cluttered desk.
Well,

896
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,990
I have more than one email account.
Uh,

897
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,320
you know,
business from managers and close

898
00:41:20,321 --> 00:41:21,520
friends.
So that's.

899
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,190
And then this one for people that have
known me forever,

900
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,940
you know,
and then there's business one for people

901
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:29,380
that I don't know that well,
you know,

902
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:33,100
that I'm like in my inner circle,
but that's,

903
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,093
that's like,

904
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,740
that's a lot of emails.
It's a lot,

905
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,070
but you're important.
One is your inner circle and your

906
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:42,650
business and that's not 4,000.
That's a lot.

907
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,300
Hundreds,
hundreds,

908
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:47,810
hundreds.
In a lot of it's nonsense.

909
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,420
It's all nonsense.
But then you feel like you can throw it

910
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:51,254
out.
Yeah,

911
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,140
if I could just keep it.
I have a garbage account.

912
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,170
I have,
I mean my one account that is.

913
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,050
Yeah,
you go down there.

914
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,670
Oh,
that's not bad.

915
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,960
Ninety
9,978,

916
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,020
but that's because I have an aol account
that I just.

917
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,940
Anytime you're in a store,
anytime,

918
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:12,740
whatever the game.
Can you sign up for something?

919
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:14,120
Can I have your email?
Can I have your email?

920
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,420
It all gets that and that's why it blows
up.

921
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,000
But my private account,
my inner circle,

922
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:23,030
one under 100.
That's where I'm staying.

923
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,950
You got basically about 4,000 big Dick
pill.

924
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,180
Yeah,
exactly.

925
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,360
Try this cough drops.
You know,

926
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:33,360
will keep me from coughing.
His cough drops work.

927
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,081
I can't.
Yeah,

928
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:35,490
they do work.
It doesn't.

929
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:38,280
I'm not coughing unless I'm talking when
I'm talking.

930
00:42:38,281 --> 00:42:40,470
I just feel that in the back of my
throat.

931
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,910
It's right at it's,
it's like two hours after running.

932
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,410
Always.
Yeah.

933
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,590
Up Up to two hours.
Maybe you that it sort of goes away.

934
00:42:49,591 --> 00:42:52,470
It's like my body to run with one of
those masks that they wear at the

935
00:42:52,471 --> 00:42:53,570
airport.
One was,

936
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,540
it's here anyway.
No,

937
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,553
no,
I'll be all right.

938
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,270
Let me try this coffee.
Some coffee.

939
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,070
Yeah,
I don't think that helps.

940
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,200
Coffee generates phlegm.
Hey,

941
00:43:04,201 --> 00:43:07,650
I saw an article this morning.
I wanted to get your thoughts on it.

942
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,810
Okay.
Uh,

943
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:13,850
I was reading about a that they're
thinking about putting a video gaming in

944
00:43:14,521 --> 00:43:17,640
the Olympics.
Yeah.

945
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,570
And the way they were talking about it,
they're like,

946
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,020
this is inevitable.
This is going to be in the Olympics.

947
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,260
And these,
uh,

948
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,390
kids consider themselves athletes.
The only hangup that they had on it was

949
00:43:27,391 --> 00:43:31,020
it the video games are violent and they
don't want to promote that.

950
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,200
But to me it was like,
well,

951
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,460
wait,
is this really a sport?

952
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:39,060
This is the Olympics trying to cash in.
That's all that is.

953
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,770
I think

954
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,360
it Olympics are dirty.
I think it's a dirty business.

955
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:47,570
And this was highlighted by the movie
Ikaros saw that movie and you realize

956
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,550
how uh,
the IOC is in bed with the world

957
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:57,030
antidoping agency and how,
you know,

958
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,220
how they sort of functioned together.
And what it really is all about is

959
00:44:02,221 --> 00:44:05,670
making money and anything that
compromises that making money,

960
00:44:05,671 --> 00:44:07,890
they're going to vote against it.
It's just,

961
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,860
it's not,
it's a dirty business.

962
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,360
And if they did have it in the Olympics,
what they would basically do is take

963
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,480
these guys who were making millions and
millions of dollars playing video games

964
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:19,890
at a professional level.
Yeah.

965
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,340
And millions.
They would make them work for free and

966
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:25,170
then they would make all the millions of
millions of dollars.

967
00:44:25,171 --> 00:44:26,030
But it's say,
Yay.

968
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,190
You get to be in the Olympics.
Dirty business.

969
00:44:29,191 --> 00:44:30,630
I think the Olympics are dirty.

970
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,440
That's terrible.
Yeah.

971
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,430
Well his chest in the Olympics.
No.

972
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,130
Why been took wrestling out.
But chassis.

973
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:40,450
We're actually moving pieces around
video games.

974
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,050
Just icons on a screen.
Like why?

975
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:43,651
What?
What do you mean?

976
00:44:43,651 --> 00:44:45,550
They took wrestling out.
It took wrestling.

977
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:47,520
Aba.
They took really took wrestling out of

978
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:48,470
the Olympics.
No,

979
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:49,751
no they did.
Yes.

980
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:51,330
They did know.
Yes.

981
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,430
I love wrestling.
And they took it out.

982
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:55,110
They might have brought it back,
but it was gone,

983
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,243
right?
Jamie?

984
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,680
No know wrestling's not out of the 11.
Yes.

985
00:44:58,681 --> 00:45:01,860
They took it out.
There was no wrestling in the summer

986
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:02,970
Olympics.
Come on.

987
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,560
I'm not kidding.
For Real.

988
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,870
For Real.
That doesn't make any sense.

989
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,340
I know.
That's crazy.

990
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:11,310
Why wouldn't I never heard of that?
I know there were.

991
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,970
There was at one point in time they were
talking about it,

992
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:16,950
but I thought that thought it was put
back in.

993
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:22,820
It was the same.
It was out for at least one and 2013 ioc

994
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:25,500
voted to drop wrestling from the summer
Olympic program.

995
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:26,520
Effective 20.
20.

996
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,830
Is that real?
Yeah.

997
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:31,370
I don't know if it's happened yet
because it's supposed to be for 20,

998
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:32,340
20.
I don't know if it's.

999
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,470
I'm pretty sure it was in the Olympics
in the summer.

1000
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,850
It was not 21 yet,
so.

1001
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,310
No,
but I mean the last Olympics that he's

1002
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,240
saying it wasn't in.
I don't think it was.

1003
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,070
Yeah,
I think it was.

1004
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:45,570
I don't think it was called Bob Costa
column.

1005
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:47,580
Now.
Bob.

1006
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,940
Bob Is your icu ward.
Bob was on an episode.

1007
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:54,180
Newsradio kicked my ass.
That was the episode.

1008
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,980
Oh really?
I thought he was hitting on this girl

1009
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:58,050
that I was dating.
He beat me up.

1010
00:45:58,051 --> 00:45:58,581
Yeah,
there it is.

1011
00:45:58,581 --> 00:46:00,720
In the Olympics.
I guess Tom Papa's wrong again.

1012
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,740
Oh,
that's from the seventies.

1013
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:06,160
Look to see that guy.
See that referees can

1014
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,260
go look at that guy,
Jesus Christ,

1015
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:14,820
96.
Go back to that and they took it out.

1016
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:17,190
All right,
so maybe it was in last time,

1017
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,970
but it's not.
What the fuck you're looking at.

1018
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:21,390
They voted against it.
Now he's trying to look jacked.

1019
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,110
He isn't Jack Weightlifting back then.
Let me tell you something,

1020
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:26,490
bro.
That guy's not jacked.

1021
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,320
He's jacked.
Pure.

1022
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,000
Let me see it.
A little of this.

1023
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,910
If the Greco Roman introduced in Athens
in 18,

1024
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:35,400
96 going on here,
the grabbing each other by the underwear

1025
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:39,130
is a different kind of wrestling.
That's ladies

1026
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,880
Buhler is a rough fucking sport.
Oh my God.

1027
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,810
I would have found this though it
they're adding um,

1028
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,500
video games to the Asian Games in 20,
22 and then it's gonna be a

1029
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:54,090
demonstration sport in Paris.
Twenty,

1030
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:55,670
24.
What's coming?

1031
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,420
Well,
wrestling,

1032
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,100
those guys don't need it.

1033
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,310
You know,
and this is my message to anybody who's

1034
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,660
a pro video gamer.
You don't need those people.

1035
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,730
What do they offer?
They offer shit.

1036
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:08,220
They want you to work for free.
They're going to make all the money.

1037
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:12,150
You were already huge and by the way,
the people run that.

1038
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,310
They missed the boat.
They didn't see it coming.

1039
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,980
They don't deserve it.
What about the athlete part of it?

1040
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,830
What about it?
Do you consider it a sport?

1041
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,810
Well,
no,

1042
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,020
it's a game,
but it's a very highly skilled game.

1043
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,850
I mean it's definitely something
valuable like the.

1044
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,100
He used to be thought as a frivolous
waste

1045
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,860
of time,
but now you can make legitimate money

1046
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:34,080
with it,
but you don't.

1047
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,550
I don't think you classify it as a
sport.

1048
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:39,520
I mean they call it east sports.
Are they an athlete?

1049
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:42,280
Is it,
is it is the top Gamer and athlete?

1050
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:47,020
The only caveat is that it's hand eye
coordination right there.

1051
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:51,160
His hand eye coordination and what do
you consider a sport?

1052
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:53,860
Do you consider something?
You move your entire body or it's just

1053
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:58,240
moving your fingers enough because his
pool of sport.

1054
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,460
Billiards.
Is that sport?

1055
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,210
I don't think it is.
I think it's A.

1056
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,330
Yeah.
It's a game that requires hand,

1057
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:08,860
eye coordination and control and touch.
Tennis is a sport,

1058
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:10,503
right?
Yeah.

1059
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,040
Tennis requires full ankle being full
mental being.

1060
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:15,511
Yeah,
you're.

1061
00:48:15,511 --> 00:48:18,160
You're running around,
you're jumping back and forth,

1062
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,390
you're swatting that ball.
They're shooting at you.

1063
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,080
Trying to get out of the way.
I mean the the amount of endurance you

1064
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:26,500
have and stamina and explosiveness all
contributes to your game.

1065
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,410
Would you make an exception for someone
that's really good at Cubert?

1066
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,640
Yes.
That was my favorite subway surfers in

1067
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,210
subway surfers and my daughter plays
that shit.

1068
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:38,044
She's a little wizard.

1069
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:42,850
It's a.
it's not a sport.

1070
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,000
The only one in the Olympics because
they realize there's massive amounts of

1071
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:48,640
people that are watching it and playing
them now and they could make a lot of

1072
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:50,190
money in arenas.
I mean they're,

1073
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,080
they're gonna.
They're filling arenas in Olympics.

1074
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:55,900
The live part of it is a billion dollar
business.

1075
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,500
Yeah.
I mean there's a lot of sports that are

1076
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:01,810
in the Olympics had no one gives a fuck
about if they're not in the Olympics.

1077
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:02,651
Right,
right.

1078
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:03,970
Like,
like that curling,

1079
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,650
curling the ski shoot one.
The skeet shooting one with a call that

1080
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:10,920
full on or pentathlon or.
Yeah,

1081
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,840
there's the one that Bruce Jenner one.
Which one was that?

1082
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,310
That's the decathlon.
Did he have to shoot shit now?

1083
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,360
Throw a spear or something now?
He did the Javelin javelins part.

1084
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:24,910
Technically a spear,
but okay.

1085
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:27,060
Is archery archery's in the Olympics?
Yeah.

1086
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,530
Is that a sport?
Um,

1087
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,350
that's more of a sport,
right?

1088
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,140
You're using your full body.
Well not really.

1089
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,430
I mean you are for stability,
you're stabilizing with your legs and

1090
00:49:39,431 --> 00:49:44,410
you have a certain stance and if your
bows heavy to pull back then it requires

1091
00:49:44,411 --> 00:49:46,810
strength,
but that's a,

1092
00:49:46,811 --> 00:49:48,880
that's blurring the lines.
It's just the scent.

1093
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:51,760
I think archery is essentially a martial
art with a tool,

1094
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,310
you know,
and then you're demonstrating but you

1095
00:49:54,311 --> 00:49:56,530
could do it on paper.
So it's target archery,

1096
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,160
target shooting in the Olympics.
Well,

1097
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,710
as part of skiing.
Right.

1098
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,220
And I think they do both.
They do it in summary reaction girl that

1099
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:08,160
was just targeted.
Yup.

1100
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,670
Just shooting,
right?

1101
00:50:09,671 --> 00:50:11,170
That girl you were telling me about.
Yeah.

1102
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:14,680
So That's interesting.
I mean that's close to a video game.

1103
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,480
Not really.
No.

1104
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,310
No.
Video Games are.

1105
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,690
Well,
I guess maybe,

1106
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,180
but like we were showing,
showing that Sarah Palin thing,

1107
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:24,110
which she was trying to shoot offhand,
totally hot,

1108
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,700
holding the gun up.
That's um,

1109
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:31,130
if you like,
that's more of a sport if you try to

1110
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:35,450
shoot offhand or pistol shooting,
I would say like pistol shooting would

1111
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,030
definitely be a sport.
Like when they do those courses,

1112
00:50:38,031 --> 00:50:40,360
you ever seen those courses that they do
for training?

1113
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,890
Ready Go.
Light goes off and then you run through

1114
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:44,970
a door and then you turn a corner and
tight,

1115
00:50:44,971 --> 00:50:45,410
tight,
tight,

1116
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,490
and then you die.
And some are bad guys and some are good

1117
00:50:49,491 --> 00:50:52,310
guys.
And then there's a bunch of different

1118
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:55,130
ones they do and some of them are just
targets and some of them are targets

1119
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:56,960
that are dressed up like people,
right?

1120
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,670
Yeah,
that's more of a sport.

1121
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,280
Well that's a very physically demanding.
Like you ever seen the candle reeves

1122
00:51:01,281 --> 00:51:03,820
footage.
Now he's training for John Wick two.

1123
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,880
Now please God make John Wick three
stuff with them running through times

1124
00:51:08,981 --> 00:51:12,260
square on a horse,
shooting people in the head in John Wick

1125
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:13,610
three.
They're already doing it,

1126
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:16,460
you know,
we'll just show the footage.

1127
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,530
First of all,
the training footage for John Wick.

1128
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,390
John Wick two.
Man,

1129
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:21,790
that mother Fucker,
Keanu Reeves,

1130
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,840
he gets into it.
He was training with my friend.

1131
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:28,841
He can Machado in Jujitsu.
So they do rubato no,

1132
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,920
here he is.
Look at him.

1133
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:32,763
Give me some volume.

1134
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,410
So like when you watch him shoot in the
movie,

1135
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,010
he looks very comfortable shooting and
even his martial arts,

1136
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,020
like the stuff that he's doing in the
movie,

1137
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:46,510
it's legitimate.
Like it's,

1138
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:48,320
it's doable.
It's real.

1139
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,780
He's really training.
Oh yeah.

1140
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,140
I mean he's not doing anything where
you'd go get the,

1141
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,990
like there's no road house moves like
house last night.

1142
00:51:56,991 --> 00:52:01,280
I love roadhouse.
I got home from the comedy store last

1143
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,110
night and it was going to go to sleep,
but roadhouse was on like,

1144
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,220
fuck,
I'm standing up.

1145
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,490
I stayed up.
It's the best gun in the bar.

1146
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,820
I watched it an hour and a half in until
he killed the guy by grabbing his neck.

1147
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,880
That's when I had to go sleep.
Um,

1148
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,160
you missed the big end scene in the
house.

1149
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,240
It's good enough.
Song I saw enough,

1150
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:20,930
but um,
so he's on a horse in John Wick three.

1151
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,370
He's the real deal.

1152
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,860
He's like Tom Cruise.
Just get back on the Chevelle.

1153
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,840
Why are you giving them a horse?
He's Tom Cruise.

1154
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,840
The 1970 Chevelle is the way to go.
Not a fucking horse.

1155
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,990
So he trains like legit shooting trains.
Legit shooting,

1156
00:52:35,991 --> 00:52:38,690
legit martial arts center.
Jackson is in it.

1157
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,920
Yep.
Oh my God.

1158
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:43,580
Samuel Jackson not in.
Is there a list of like 10 films?

1159
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,810
Start being an actor until he was late
in his career and his age.

1160
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,020
Oh yeah.
Just read the summary.

1161
00:52:49,021 --> 00:52:51,650
So how old was he?
I want to say 40,

1162
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:55,610
but I feel like I might be mixing them
up with something that might be Rodney

1163
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:56,690
dangerfield.
Um,

1164
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,150
yeah.
The original.

1165
00:52:59,151 --> 00:53:02,360
John Wick is a fucking great movie in
John Wick Two was a great movie.

1166
00:53:02,361 --> 00:53:05,930
They're both great.
I watched two of them back to back on a

1167
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:07,910
plane recently.
Is that the one where everything's on

1168
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:12,290
fire in that one scene where he's like
coming out of an apartment twos one when

1169
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:15,260
he's fighting that Ruby rose chick is a
fight with ruby rose.

1170
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:20,420
Will Laureus
Girl Power?

1171
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,130
Save it?
Save.

1172
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,100
It.
Takes such a good punch.

1173
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,990
Yeah.
KIANNA's pulling.

1174
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,400
Pulling punches.
Yeah.

1175
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,010
He's legit.
Tom Cruise.

1176
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:34,620
He trains and does all his real stuff.
Yeah.

1177
00:53:34,621 --> 00:53:36,740
Tom Cruise does a lot of crazy stuff.
Yeah.

1178
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,510
He fucked up his ankle.
Jumping off of a building to another

1179
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:40,320
building.
Yeah.

1180
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,350
Climate on the outside of planes hanging
on and does all that stupid shit.

1181
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,010
Car Chases.
He does that and does it himself in

1182
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:49,020
Dubai.
Hanging off the end of that building.

1183
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:51,300
Guys.
He's a maniac.

1184
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:54,810
He is a maniac.
I wouldn't just fighting off them.

1185
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:59,811
Scientology demons were using angels.
Angels are just Eton's.

1186
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,380
Dayton's are the bad things.
Those are things that stick to you.

1187
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,080
Right?
I thought that was where like your soul,

1188
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,620
like that's who you are.
You are eaten like in the shell of A.

1189
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,740
I thought the themes were like the bad
ones that came in.

1190
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,110
You had to fend off everything.
I know about scientology,

1191
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:21,111
I learned from South Park
from that a long movie I learned to

1192
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:25,440
Code.

1193
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,620
I learned a couple of useful things from
learning about it.

1194
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,540
Going clear.
Did you see going clear with

1195
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:31,510
documentary?
Yeah.

1196
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,440
Do you read the book?
No books crazy too.

1197
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,720
I read some of dianetics though.
I did too.

1198
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:37,993
Yeah.
Yeah,

1199
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,010
I read it when I first moved to La.
I bought it or ordered it on late night

1200
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,000
TV.
Yeah.

1201
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,700
I wanted to.
I wanted my nephews to get to join up.

1202
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:49,110
Just see what would happen.
What do you hate your sister or your

1203
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:51,450
brother?
Who was one of us has got a Brit kinda

1204
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,670
being a pioneer here.
Let's go see what this.

1205
00:54:53,671 --> 00:54:55,500
Does one of us going to join the cult?
Yeah.

1206
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,110
It's too late for me to get in there.
See what happened.

1207
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,630
Have you seen wild wild country?
Yeah.

1208
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:05,070
In reading his book,
the Art Osho his book,

1209
00:55:05,071 --> 00:55:06,780
the art of living and dying.
Oh yeah.

1210
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,160
It's very interesting.

1211
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:13,370
He knows what's unique about him.
Is that the things that he's saying or,

1212
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,500
or like legitimately profound and very
interesting and like legitimately deeply

1213
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:22,500
philosophical,
like you're reading it and you go,

1214
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:23,280
okay,
this is a,

1215
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,260
this guy was a real thinking person and
he was like deeply considering these

1216
00:55:28,261 --> 00:55:33,261
things from all sorts of different
angles and yet he allowed that crazy

1217
00:55:34,171 --> 00:55:39,171
Sheila lady to run his call and poisoned
people and nations.

1218
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,580
But even before that he was collecting
rolls royces and he was like,

1219
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:47,100
he was,
he loved the love luxury.

1220
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,710
The problem.
Look,

1221
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,390
a lot of people have good ideas.
They try and motivate people.

1222
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:53,310
It starts out like these nice
intentions,

1223
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:55,410
whatever.
Once they taste money,

1224
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:57,450
that's it.
It's over greed.

1225
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,360
It just takes you over and you can't
shake it.

1226
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:01,800
It's like,
why would I be in a,

1227
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,350
in a,
uh,

1228
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,820
for tourists when I've had a Rolls
Royce?

1229
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:08,010
Well,
how about just one rolls Royce,

1230
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:08,940
Bro.
I know,

1231
00:56:08,941 --> 00:56:12,450
but these people need to power power and
greed.

1232
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:15,030
It's,
it's and celebrity and then you can't

1233
00:56:15,031 --> 00:56:16,780
shake it.
All these televangelists,

1234
00:56:16,781 --> 00:56:20,190
when all those televangelists wind down,
like they start off like preaching

1235
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,770
around the south dirty,
like in little churches.

1236
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,020
Then they started making millions of
dollars and it goes off the rails.

1237
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:28,630
Greed,
demon.

1238
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,340
I'm telling you,
there's.

1239
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,370
I guess they're similar.
I mean because like that guy from what

1240
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:35,380
you're saying,
he has some good points is some good

1241
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:38,230
stuff.
There's some stuff in dianetics that's

1242
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,150
makes very good sense that.
Hold on.

1243
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:45,340
Don't you think that all that good stuff
is negated by a love of objects?

1244
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,990
I think that it ends up corrupting them
and they start making other choices that

1245
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:52,610
don't align with what they're preaching,
right?

1246
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,630
Yeah.
I think it's where they're human beings.

1247
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:59,620
We're all human beings and you start
getting that power and then all of this

1248
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:04,720
money comes in and it was rough sex.
There was also a lot of sex.

1249
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:08,380
A lot of sex.
Cult was a lot about just free sex.

1250
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,550
Everybody banging everybody.
It's funny how it all comes down to

1251
00:57:12,551 --> 00:57:17,410
those things is always becomes sex,
money,

1252
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,740
power and celebrity.
That's a potent comp.

1253
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,450
Like they all fall from those things.
Desires these great benefits to all

1254
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:26,230
those things,
right?

1255
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,080
Sex feels great if you have a lot of
money,

1256
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:31,960
you can buy awesome things and you enjoy
them and you feel like you've

1257
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:35,410
accomplished something if you have a lot
of celebrity than everybody kisses your

1258
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:39,160
ass and he would walk in the room and
his hands class together and everybody

1259
00:57:39,161 --> 00:57:41,650
would go crazy.
But it's a different kind of celebrity,

1260
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:42,484
right?
It's not.

1261
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:44,800
His celebrity was not just like,
oh,

1262
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:46,390
there's Tom Papa,
dude.

1263
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:49,060
I love your bread show.
It wasn't that.

1264
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,420
It was.
You have.

1265
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,780
The answer is oh,
well that's.

1266
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:56,620
Yeah,
but that's the,

1267
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,750
that's the ultimate power is celebrity
mixed with God mixed with the answer to

1268
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:04,020
that guru,
that power.

1269
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,460
Now you're off the charts.
Well,

1270
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:08,290
you get a little bit of that in yoga
classes.

1271
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,350
There was a yoga class that I used to go
to where the guy who was the instructor

1272
00:58:11,351 --> 00:58:15,670
was banging some of the students and uh,
he was slimy.

1273
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:16,631
Yeah.
He was like,

1274
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:21,631
you could tell he would sing in class,
like sing songs and be like,

1275
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:24,430
Bro,
you are killing my buddy.

1276
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,550
Yeah,
I'm out of there.

1277
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:28,780
And you're so white,
like everything about it.

1278
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:30,600
He was just like,
he was a,

1279
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,170
uh,
a slippery guy.

1280
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:37,450
Like in his thing was being this,
this really spiritual yoga guy,

1281
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,740
his 40 year old women whose husbands
retired a fucking them.

1282
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,630
They would really,
you know him.

1283
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:46,330
Next thing you know,
he'd be given them privates,

1284
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:50,260
air
bowel checkup.

1285
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:54,340
I,
he would probably talk to them about

1286
00:58:54,341 --> 00:58:59,341
sensuality and of course in their aura.
And then probably lay some shit down

1287
00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:00,350
about,
you know,

1288
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,810
one of the main problems in
relationships is there.

1289
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:07,480
The Passion sometimes ebbs when there's
a loss of respect and appreciation for

1290
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,960
each other as individuals as unique
soul's.

1291
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,080
Yes.
I'm experiencing that in my

1292
00:59:14,081 --> 00:59:15,370
relationship.
I'm so sorry.

1293
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,060
So sorry to hear that.
The boundaries of intimacy should not be

1294
00:59:19,061 --> 00:59:20,050
related,
is it me?

1295
00:59:20,051 --> 00:59:24,430
But I feel like I'm seeing the real you,
that no one else sees boundaries in

1296
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,410
intimacy should not be confined by a
piece of paper.

1297
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:28,641
You know,
I mean,

1298
00:59:28,641 --> 00:59:31,940
it's obviously that the vows of your
marriage have already been broken by

1299
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:33,740
your husband who's not nice to you
anymore.

1300
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:36,650
Let me write down the apartment.
My apartment in Encino,

1301
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,610
sweet yoga,
Dick Brown,

1302
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:45,820
Brown walk around barefoot everywhere.
The hot yoga guy touch with nature.

1303
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,440
The hot yoga guy.
He got busted for sleeping with all

1304
00:59:48,441 --> 00:59:49,910
these women and was the hot yoga.

1305
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:57,980
He fucked everybody more than that.
He was accused of sexual assault.

1306
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:01,910
He wasn't.
My guy wasn't sexually assaulting

1307
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:05,660
anybody who's just slipping the Deq in.
They were allowing it.

1308
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:07,850
They wanted the deck like there's a
difference,

1309
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,340
you know,
but then there's some people that it's a

1310
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:12,660
power move,
but some people say that that's abuse,

1311
01:00:12,661 --> 01:00:13,310
that the,
the,

1312
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:18,310
the Yoga Guru who manipulates the woman
and then foxer that he is in a way

1313
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:27,580
definitely being guilty of sexual
misconduct and perhaps even something

1314
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,960
more egregious because there's a
relationship that they have between the

1315
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:37,610
guru and the student and he's violating
that trust in that power dynamic.

1316
01:00:37,611 --> 01:00:39,980
Yes,
that's Catholic church,

1317
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:40,660
but.
Right.

1318
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:41,790
I mean it's the same.

1319
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,310
What do you mean?
Forty year old married woman in a

1320
01:00:46,311 --> 01:00:49,220
fucking yoga teacher is not the same as
a little kid in a priest,

1321
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:51,830
but it's using power for them to get the
same thing.

1322
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,150
Oh No,
it's not.

1323
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:56,150
One of them is rape and abuse.
The other one is a lady wants Dick.

1324
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:57,440
Well,
you didn't say she wanted to

1325
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:03,310
touch her.
Just twisted this around and apologize.

1326
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,870
All those yoga teachers out there
fucking their students.

1327
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,450
Now that's a violation.
If you're a guru,

1328
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,590
anything that's a teacher and below
you're using that,

1329
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,410
you're manipulating that person.
Okay.

1330
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:20,330
But wasn't that like a big part of like
a undergraduate students and professors

1331
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:22,580
back in the day?
They can't do that anymore.

1332
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:23,860
Yeah,
that was a big thing.

1333
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,760
No,
in my high school,

1334
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:30,090
the basketball teacher ended up marrying
like his best girl basketball player.

1335
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:33,590
Hey,
happy ending yet worked out.

1336
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:35,240
Oh,
well how old was she beating him?

1337
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,230
He was probably 30 something and she was
17.

1338
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,480
Whoa.
When did they get my basketball?

1339
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,020
I don't know.
After school.

1340
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,070
During school now.
Apparently it was Doris and then they

1341
01:01:49,071 --> 01:01:50,990
ended up.
Was illegal then?

1342
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,970
No,
no,

1343
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:53,241
no,
no,

1344
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:57,080
no.
In many states it probably was legal in

1345
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:58,220
Jersey.
Yes.

1346
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,460
I guarantee you it was what year?
Nineteen 85.

1347
01:02:01,461 --> 01:02:02,690
80 seven.
Guarantee it was.

1348
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:05,260
17 was legal.
I bet it was legal really.

1349
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:06,950
I bet.
I bet 16 was legal,

1350
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,080
right?
Yeah.

1351
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,590
And that's not to say that there can't
be a happy ending when somebody is the

1352
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:16,190
teacher or for the quarter on your side.
I mean it's definitely a violation,

1353
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:19,140
but it is manipulation.
What's the age of consent in 19 eight?

1354
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,460
Note New Jersey.

1355
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,470
Age Sixteen years old.
16.

1356
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:24,000
Yup.
Wow.

1357
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,070
I could have hit on this crew.
Okay.

1358
01:02:26,071 --> 01:02:28,440
But hold on a second.
Consent for sexual conduct.

1359
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,750
16.
This applies to both heterosexual and

1360
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:33,030
homosexual conduct.
As a general matter,

1361
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:37,920
this means that a person who is 16 years
old can generally consent to have sex

1362
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:40,680
with any adult.
And this is in 2018.

1363
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,450
That's today.
That's today.

1364
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:44,760
So here's the thing,
here's the thing,

1365
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,770
like,
you know this Asia Argento thing

1366
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:53,730
going on right now.
So the 17 year old kid when he had sex

1367
01:02:53,731 --> 01:02:55,350
with her,
it was in California.

1368
01:02:55,530 --> 01:03:00,530
So he's saying it's sexual assault
because she had sex with him and then

1369
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:05,460
she got Tony Bourdain to pay this kid
off.

1370
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:09,150
Three hundred plus thousand dollars to
shut his mouth.

1371
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:13,710
And then it came out that she was a
hypocrite because she seduced this kid

1372
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:17,880
and fucked him and she had played his
mom and a movie 10 years prior when he

1373
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,510
was only seven,
which is really kind crazy.

1374
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:24,990
There's pictures of her and the kid when
the kid was a like a little kid,

1375
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:29,520
she stayed close to him and called him
like her son and he would call her mom

1376
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:32,760
and stuff like that.
And then they got together and she lied

1377
01:03:32,761 --> 01:03:35,700
about it and so she didn't fuck up.
And then pictures came out of her in bed

1378
01:03:35,701 --> 01:03:38,850
with them.
And then her friends released text

1379
01:03:38,851 --> 01:03:40,980
messages.
She,

1380
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:46,370
she's a fucking monster in a way.
Was he of legal age when they had sex?

1381
01:03:46,381 --> 01:03:48,600
This is my point.
He was 17 at the time,

1382
01:03:48,601 --> 01:03:51,060
so it have been totally legal if this
happened in New Jersey,

1383
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:54,330
but it happened in California,
but this is all going on while she was

1384
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,390
making a big deal of Harvey Weinstein
having sex with her when she was 22,

1385
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,090
like Jesus fucking Christ.
I was crippled.

1386
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,340
Chris,
you know,

1387
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:02,730
the whole thing is crazy.

1388
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:05,790
But my point is,
first of all,

1389
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:10,670
let's be honest about that situation.
I mean seventeens,

1390
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,160
he's going to be okay that I'm just
saying,

1391
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:18,630
even if it's illegal,
it's just not the same for boys.

1392
01:04:18,631 --> 01:04:20,940
It is not the same.
Should she have done it?

1393
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,780
Probably not.
Yeah,

1394
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,933
definitely.
Probably not.

1395
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,880
Should she be locked up in a cage for 10
years for doing that?

1396
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:28,590
Now?
She's a freak,

1397
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,450
right?
That lady is a freak.

1398
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,750
She was.
He was 17,

1399
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,360
but she's more guilty of being a
hypocrite than anything.

1400
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,720
Did she stay in touch with them all
those years?

1401
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,620
She was playing the mom,
yes.

1402
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:44,400
The real creepy pictures her in the
movie with him when he was like a little

1403
01:04:44,401 --> 01:04:47,730
kid,
but it's not as creepy as woody Allen

1404
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,110
when he had his daughter sitting on his
lap and then 10 years later that same

1405
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:54,570
daughter is holding his hand as his
girlfriend in a brand,

1406
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,030
in the front row of a basketball game.
It's kind of weird.

1407
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:02,640
Think that's a little creepier.
That's why that is so weird.

1408
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:07,140
I don't know if you even a reason to
make that comparison,

1409
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:12,380
but the point is that kid would have no
case at all if this was in New Jersey,

1410
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:14,530
right?
It was in New Jersey,

1411
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:16,230
which I don't think he should have a
case.

1412
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,090
Does he?
Is he prosecuting like

1413
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,460
or he.
He apparently threatened to go public

1414
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,680
within.
He wanted money and they gave him money.

1415
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:26,200
Anthony Bourdain did and gave them a
lot.

1416
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:29,980
300,
$380,000 and even after he got paid,

1417
01:05:29,981 --> 01:05:32,650
he comes out.
That is the most expensive dick that

1418
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:36,420
lady will ever get.
Then he comes out,

1419
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,630
comes out.
It came out anyway.

1420
01:05:37,631 --> 01:05:39,910
I don't know why it came out.
I don't know who released it.

1421
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:41,410
Harvey Weinstein,
somebody.

1422
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:43,360
Somebody released it.
I don't know what happened,

1423
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:48,600
but what they're basically showing is
that this whole thing,

1424
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:52,720
you know,
of her attacking being attacked by

1425
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:54,520
Harvey Weinstein.
It's complicated.

1426
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:57,250
Maybe he did exactly what she said he
did.

1427
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:01,060
It's possible,
but she clearly is deceptive.

1428
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:06,300
She definitely lied about this kid.
The problem is the age of consent being

1429
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:09,370
17,
if it was 18 or if it was.

1430
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:12,380
If he was 18 rather,
or if it was like in New Jersey where at

1431
01:06:12,381 --> 01:06:17,381
16 there's no case and she just fucked a
young kid and I'm just going to be

1432
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:18,274
honest.

1433
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:23,820
The only thing that's creepy is that
they had this sort of mom's son thing

1434
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:25,600
going on with.
They talked about each other as mom and

1435
01:06:25,601 --> 01:06:26,290
said,
that's weird.

1436
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:31,290
If she was just a hot 35 year old who
had sex with a handsome 17 year old boy

1437
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:35,890
seventeens as a man.
It's not the same thing.

1438
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,830
It's not the same thing.
If it was a 35 year old man and a 17

1439
01:06:38,831 --> 01:06:41,140
year old girl,
she directed the movie too.

1440
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:42,200
Does that change?
Yes.

1441
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:45,380
She directed the movie,
the new one,

1442
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:50,200
the movie 10 years ago when he was a 17
year old or a seven year old rather.

1443
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,910
Yeah.
I don't know man.

1444
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:52,840
You know my,
my.

1445
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:58,290
She was 37 when she was seven.
She was seven when he was 17.

1446
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,480
She.
She didn't make a move when,

1447
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:03,640
when he was seven though dose.
She was waited until he was 17.

1448
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:05,760
She's a good person.
Yeah.

1449
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,190
She,
when she got close to the wire,

1450
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,260
she's like,
I can't hold on anymore.

1451
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:14,440
And then for ready,
it's will you move to New Jersey?

1452
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:16,690
I won't over here.
Here's the issue.

1453
01:07:16,691 --> 01:07:19,570
I don't.
I just don't think it's the same thing

1454
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,880
now.
I think the only thing she's really

1455
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:24,580
guilty of here is hypocrisy and
deception.

1456
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:28,990
I don't think she's guilty of a sex
crime even though she technically is in

1457
01:07:28,991 --> 01:07:30,160
my mind.
I mean,

1458
01:07:30,161 --> 01:07:31,720
maybe I'm.
Am I a sexist?

1459
01:07:31,721 --> 01:07:35,380
I don't know if I am.
I'm sexist against men.

1460
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:36,623
Well,
I just think.

1461
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,190
I think the guy's going to be okay.
I just don't.

1462
01:07:39,191 --> 01:07:41,050
I don't buy that.
He was so damaged,

1463
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,390
but I knew that he was,
that damage from her.

1464
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,490
He would have been dead.
He would have been damaged from a girl

1465
01:07:45,491 --> 01:07:47,570
who was his age too.
Who fucked him and then didn't call

1466
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:47,730
them.

1467
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,730
Right.
That's the thing.

1468
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:50,590
Emotions.
That's not a crime.

1469
01:07:50,591 --> 01:07:51,191
You know,
you hear it,

1470
01:07:51,191 --> 01:07:52,210
you hear this argument.
It's like,

1471
01:07:52,211 --> 01:07:56,230
well a boy can be effective for sure.
Everyone can be affected.

1472
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,570
And when you're 40,
you know,

1473
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:00,940
in some of these instances where the
teacher sleeps with the kid and it's a

1474
01:08:00,941 --> 01:08:03,910
boy and he's 14 and people are like,
oh,

1475
01:08:03,911 --> 01:08:05,110
come on.
He would love it.

1476
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,480
He's,
he's a boy now at 14,

1477
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:10,510
you're still don't know who you are.
You're still mixed up.

1478
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:13,180
And again,
we're a teacher student dynamic.

1479
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:15,740
It's a different situation.
She's stipulating you.

1480
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:16,070
Right?
So

1481
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,910
the question is,
is this dynamic equal to the teacher

1482
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:22,040
student?
Because she was the director and she

1483
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:27,041
played his mother and she clearly had
some sort of a maternal love like sort

1484
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:32,720
of relationship with him early on.
And then it became sexual later.

1485
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:36,590
But then she says he jumped her.
She says the Horny kid jumped me.

1486
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:39,320
That's what she said to her friend when
she's being honest.

1487
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,030
Yeah.
So maybe he did.

1488
01:08:41,031 --> 01:08:43,610
Maybe he was in love and pining for the
whole time.

1489
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:47,660
Maybe that's one of the reasons why he
came out and wanted money in the first

1490
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:49,820
place to trying to get back at her
because she didn't want to have anything

1491
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:52,970
to do with him anymore.
And maybe they had a couple of drinks

1492
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:55,610
together and she,
you know,

1493
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:59,210
she just didn't know what to do when he
started making moves on her and so she

1494
01:08:59,211 --> 01:09:02,830
fucked him because she's crazy.
That's possible to know.

1495
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,670
What is it?
Is it a crime?

1496
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:06,140
I mean,
what you're telling,

1497
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:09,170
you're talking about a crime where if it
was 200 days later,

1498
01:09:09,171 --> 01:09:12,560
it's not a crime.
Like really is he going to learn a lot

1499
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:13,460
in 200 days?

1500
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:15,280
Laws the law.
Joe,

1501
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,070
the law's the law.
Mr. Dragnet over there.

1502
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:21,690
You gotta pay you gotta you know the
laws are on the books for reason.

1503
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:25,270
Joe.
And then launch says 17 doesn't say 16

1504
01:09:25,271 --> 01:09:28,840
and a half.
[inaudible] 17 for region johnny lawyer

1505
01:09:28,841 --> 01:09:30,970
over here.
Well it really does.

1506
01:09:30,971 --> 01:09:33,250
That's what it comes down to it.
It's like we,

1507
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,580
because it's so gray and because there's
so many things that can happen,

1508
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:39,450
you really have to be come down to what
was their last.

1509
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,800
Have to pull your pants down.
How much premiums you got.

1510
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,290
Let me see what you got.
How big your deck,

1511
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,690
your full ground.
The fuck out here.

1512
01:09:46,691 --> 01:09:48,520
Pussy.
That's not fair.

1513
01:09:48,521 --> 01:09:53,521
I remember 80 bang,
I had a friend of mine who grew hair

1514
01:09:53,531 --> 01:09:56,920
when he was 12.
He was a little Italian kid.

1515
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:01,810
He had a mustache full team.
I'm sure his pupils were gigantic.

1516
01:10:01,811 --> 01:10:06,811
Good
Asia Argento go fuck that guy.

1517
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,270
He couldn't help it.
He would get a haircut and would grow

1518
01:10:10,271 --> 01:10:14,410
back by the time he got in the car,
he was just Italian.

1519
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,230
Yeah,
it's complicated.

1520
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,350
You know.
The thing is

1521
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,080
she had a consensual sexual relationship
with Harvey Weinstein after the alleged

1522
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:27,320
incident where he ate her pussy and she
didn't want him to.

1523
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,540
Well that's like the cosby thing.
They keep coming back.

1524
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:32,310
There was a couple that came back and

1525
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:35,220
don't wait a minute.
Were they aware that he drugged them the

1526
01:10:35,221 --> 01:10:36,054
first time?

1527
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,300
Uh,
I don't know the details.

1528
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:41,180
It sounded like it sounded like they
knew something was weird,

1529
01:10:41,181 --> 01:10:43,170
but then they came back anyway.
But you didn't like

1530
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,150
exonerate someone from a rape just
because after the rape you're friendly

1531
01:10:47,151 --> 01:10:47,840
with them.

1532
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,230
Right.
Because you know,

1533
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:52,130
it's a big mental impact.
You don't know what's going on with

1534
01:10:52,131 --> 01:10:52,700
these.

1535
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:57,700
Just that it's some people they want to
mitigate the effects of being raped by

1536
01:10:57,891 --> 01:11:01,880
turning into something different.
So they made me would establish a

1537
01:11:01,881 --> 01:11:04,130
consensual relationship with the person
after they rape

1538
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:05,960
them to try and take their power back a
little.

1539
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:07,170
Well,
not just that,

1540
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:10,880
to try to relieve themselves of the
feeling of being a victim.

1541
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:14,310
They almost make it consensual.
There's like a weird psychological

1542
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:18,540
dynamic that you and I will never
understand as men will never understand.

1543
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,070
And now because it's not the same,
it's just.

1544
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:21,210
No,
it's not.

1545
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,620
So if she went back,
you know,

1546
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:24,563
with Harvey

1547
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:27,470
woman can't comes over your house.
Right.

1548
01:11:27,471 --> 01:11:28,910
Okay.
If you're a single guy,

1549
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,830
am I in a cabinet?
A little cabin,

1550
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,210
a little tiny,
$320.

1551
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,980
It's,
you're in big bear.

1552
01:11:33,981 --> 01:11:36,290
You weren't there,
you weren't flannels and you're cutting

1553
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:37,124
wood.
Okay.

1554
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,790
And a girl comes over and she sucks your
Dick against your will.

1555
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:42,920
Don't stop.
I can't believe you're doing this.

1556
01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:46,310
God Damn it.
And then once it's over,

1557
01:11:46,311 --> 01:11:47,180
you're like,
well,

1558
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,340
I don't want to feel like I got raped.
I'm just going to establish a

1559
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,640
relationship with this lady.
Would be like,

1560
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:55,130
shut the fuck up Tom,
Papa Kid Outta here.

1561
01:11:55,131 --> 01:11:58,880
It was that Michael differences because
you're a guy.

1562
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:01,760
You're not worried about your physical
safety.

1563
01:12:01,761 --> 01:12:03,590
This is the real issue.
Physical Safety.

1564
01:12:03,591 --> 01:12:06,320
I can't get pregnant.
I used to work out with his gay.

1565
01:12:06,321 --> 01:12:09,950
Jim used to work out at Gold's gym on
coal and I say gay gym because it was

1566
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:14,810
just like a lot of gay guys,
like really obvious overtanned,

1567
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:18,290
you know gay guys were like super thin
tank,

1568
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:22,100
top muscles,
fucking combat boots and real

1569
01:12:22,101 --> 01:12:22,934
aggressive.

1570
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:25,850
Yeah.
Leather fucking paper Boi.

1571
01:12:25,851 --> 01:12:28,760
Hats on and mother working out.
I had a friend can gay,

1572
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:31,040
but my point is while I was in there
working out,

1573
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:34,670
these guys would hit on you right now
and you'd feel like,

1574
01:12:34,671 --> 01:12:36,590
guys,
we're looking at you and hitting on you

1575
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:41,330
and it made you uncomfortable.
Well welcome to being a woman and not

1576
01:12:41,331 --> 01:12:43,940
even really because I could fuck those
guys up.

1577
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,970
So I wasn't worried.
Like if a guy tries to go to the parking

1578
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:47,960
lot,
I'd be like,

1579
01:12:47,961 --> 01:12:49,250
hey dude,
we're good.

1580
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,460
This is going to get violent.
Stopped trying to fuck me right now.

1581
01:12:52,461 --> 01:12:56,180
Like I can actually fuck you up,
whereas if I'm a girl I have to worry

1582
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:59,930
that I'm fumbling for my keys and these
guys behind me in the parking lot and

1583
01:12:59,931 --> 01:13:02,120
they want to push me into the car and
take my pants off.

1584
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:04,940
This is a real concern for women that
men don't have.

1585
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,170
So our ideas of what it would be like to
be in a non consensual relationship with

1586
01:13:09,171 --> 01:13:10,970
a woman where she sucks your Dick
against your will.

1587
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:11,810
It's just not comparable.

1588
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:16,970
That's a great point.
Michael Douglas movie came out and it

1589
01:13:16,971 --> 01:13:18,530
was the same thing.
It was the reverse.

1590
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:23,030
I forget which movie was he?
She goes down on him and he's like,

1591
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:24,050
no,
stop it.

1592
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,660
It's a work relationship.
And he's like,

1593
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:29,240
stop down little attraction now.
It wasn't fatal attraction.

1594
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:33,230
It wasn't behind the candelabra it was,
uh,

1595
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,750
it was another movie and it became like
a thing.

1596
01:13:35,751 --> 01:13:39,710
It became like a,
like a joke because as a disclosure,

1597
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:42,170
because as,
and who was the star?

1598
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:44,450
Demi Moore.
That's hilarious.

1599
01:13:44,451 --> 01:13:46,770
Yeah.
So she goes down on him and everyone

1600
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:50,840
they were trying to make the case that
it could happen to a man to the culture

1601
01:13:50,841 --> 01:13:53,330
was like,
now god,

1602
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:54,410
here it is.
Yeah,

1603
01:13:54,411 --> 01:13:55,850
she's a predator.
Yeah,

1604
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:56,750
Predator,
I'll leave

1605
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,400
this.
Shut up.

1606
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,390
Get off.
Wrote that a fantastic sex thriller.

1607
01:14:02,391 --> 01:14:04,850
Masterfully done.
That's fake news.

1608
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,210
Wrote that.
Well,

1609
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:07,820
good for them.
Putting it out there and giving it a

1610
01:14:07,821 --> 01:14:11,350
try.
Kelly always have that like fucking wcn

1611
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,320
TV.
Some Shit you've never heard of wwe.

1612
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:16,720
Oh RTV.
Fuck out of here.

1613
01:14:16,721 --> 01:14:21,220
What is that like
for any quote whatsoever?

1614
01:14:21,221 --> 01:14:25,900
So they just take some wonky quote from
the Boise News station.

1615
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,230
Some guy's drunk when he writes out,
he's barely paying attention now it's

1616
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:32,190
just someone with a blog.
It's like dawn's movie hut.

1617
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:39,060
He loved it in the middle of the forest
when they were.

1618
01:14:40,361 --> 01:14:41,710
When I was watching road house last
night,

1619
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:44,920
he put a cassette and this is Mercedes
car is playing music,

1620
01:14:44,921 --> 01:14:46,720
shoved in the in there and play.
And I was like,

1621
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:49,180
yes,
fucking kiss.

1622
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:51,280
My daughter got a cassette from one of
her friends,

1623
01:14:51,281 --> 01:14:53,890
a cassette player looking for cassettes.

1624
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:56,130
Yeah,
get them day or something.

1625
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:57,160
Yeah.
Yeah,

1626
01:14:57,161 --> 01:15:00,190
like she has a punch,
but they're really pretty obscure.

1627
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:03,100
This is a real concern that everything
that we have is digital,

1628
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,650
you know,
and that we're moving to kindles and

1629
01:15:05,651 --> 01:15:09,580
ebooks and all these different things,
and then he downloadable music and less

1630
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:14,620
physical music that anything that
happens that wipes that stuff out,

1631
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:18,140
that wipes out their ability to play it
a deserve.

1632
01:15:18,141 --> 01:15:20,740
The recording we lose every.
There'll be gone forever.

1633
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,500
All information,
all of our information is becoming

1634
01:15:23,501 --> 01:15:26,110
digital.
I becoming more and more vulnerable.

1635
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:31,050
We're becoming more and more aware and
more and more educated that were risk.

1636
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:33,820
Like we're.
We're more aware that we're being

1637
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,980
attacked,
like people are trying to steal this

1638
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:38,280
stuff and we're putting more of our
faith in it.

1639
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,120
Yeah,
but what I'm saying is as we become more

1640
01:15:40,121 --> 01:15:41,680
educated,
not even with that,

1641
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:43,480
just the more information we
accumulated,

1642
01:15:43,481 --> 01:15:45,970
the more vulnerable that information
ends.

1643
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:50,530
It's not like books that are like locked
solid and they're always going to be

1644
01:15:50,531 --> 01:15:52,630
there as long as you keep it in a
fireproof container.

1645
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,380
No,
this is our.

1646
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:58,900
Our knowledge itself is way more
vulnerable than it's ever been before.

1647
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:00,950
Yet way more advanced.
It's interesting.

1648
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,770
We've been before.
That's really interesting.

1649
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,920
Fucking weird,
but isn't it all backed up on the cloud?

1650
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:10,630
What does that mean?
I had Dr Robert Schoch on the podcast,

1651
01:16:10,631 --> 01:16:15,160
who's a geologist from Boston University
freaked me the fuck out talking about

1652
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:20,020
coronal mass ejections from the sun and
that what what they believe happened

1653
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:24,700
somewhere around 12,000 years ago.
There was some sort of a gigantic solar

1654
01:16:24,701 --> 01:16:27,830
event that caused lightening storms.
You know,

1655
01:16:27,831 --> 01:16:30,640
like when it's a storm and rain is
coming down from the sky,

1656
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:34,270
like fucking buckets of rain everywhere.
He said it was like that with lightning

1657
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:38,740
and the lightning literally turning the
ground and the glass and certain places.

1658
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,240
How long?
Who knows?

1659
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:45,090
Mass extinction of animals.
Really mass extinction of people like

1660
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,200
just lightening raining down on the
whole planet.

1661
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,210
It wasn't my gun off.
He's right.

1662
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:53,470
Obviously it's a controversial theory
that he was proposing,

1663
01:16:53,471 --> 01:16:58,471
but it's based on what they believe
possibly happened with a coronal mass

1664
01:16:59,051 --> 01:17:02,960
ejection from the sun,
which can and does happen and has had

1665
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,200
passed.
I always think about that,

1666
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,660
like,
what's going to stop like a giant

1667
01:17:07,661 --> 01:17:08,560
asteroid?
All of a sudden

1668
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:12,260
they're happening all the time.
Yeah.

1669
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:14,930
It's just not big intensity,
but why not?

1670
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:19,990
Why not have one buildup and last I seen
a comparison of the earth next to the

1671
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,940
sun.
Yeah.

1672
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:26,030
When they show the solar flares are
hundreds of times larger than the earth

1673
01:17:26,031 --> 01:17:29,800
itself.
It's so crazy like,

1674
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,250
but it's far away,
right guys?

1675
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:33,800
It'll be okay.
We're still gonna have a barbecue this

1676
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,820
weekend.
Couple million miles.

1677
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,450
How many miles is the sun away?
How many million?

1678
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:41,270
There's the.
Yeah,

1679
01:17:41,271 --> 01:17:43,940
the moon is $200.
It varies.

1680
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:46,490
It goes a little closer.
A little further away,

1681
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:48,720
but somewhere around 200.
Sixty thousand.

1682
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:50,290
Two hundred.
Sixty thousand.

1683
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,060
Ninety 3 million miles.
The Sun.

1684
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,760
Yeah.
Let me pull up a comparison.

1685
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:00,460
The Sun in comparison to the size of the
earth in you,

1686
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,060
you realize like,
Oh,

1687
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,740
a million times bigger.
A million times.

1688
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,760
Million Times bigger than the earth.
Yeah.

1689
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,340
Boy,
that's a big question.

1690
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:12,470
Say a solar flare pops off.

1691
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:14,510
If it's that far away,
you're fucked.

1692
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,320
Depends on how many know about it.
Know it's coming for awhile.

1693
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,770
You have a couple minutes just.
Oh,

1694
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:22,900
that's going to look at that.
Look at the one point $3.

1695
01:18:22,901 --> 01:18:24,860
Billion earths.
Oh Geez.

1696
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:26,720
Look at the earth though with a little
dot

1697
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:29,373
right there.
Oh there.

1698
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:34,250
Oh my God.
Now look at those ejections.

1699
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:36,110
Look at those flares.
Oh no big.

1700
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,450
Those flares are.
And then look at the size of the earth.

1701
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:39,500
Like those.
That's common.

1702
01:18:39,501 --> 01:18:41,240
That's every day that's happening all
the time.

1703
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,390
Have you ever seen video of it?
It's fucking amazing.

1704
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:45,950
It's crazy.
It's amazing.

1705
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:48,980
Like what's happening on the sun right
now?

1706
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:52,730
Should freak everybody the fuck out.
And it varies.

1707
01:18:52,731 --> 01:18:53,570
You know?
It's like,

1708
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:55,840
it's a giant nuclear fireball.
Yeah.

1709
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:59,450
It's just a constant nuclear explosion.
Oh my God.

1710
01:18:59,451 --> 01:19:01,310
Look at that shit.
It looks so hot.

1711
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:06,350
What a shit design,
right?

1712
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:11,400
How are you going to heat everything up?
We'll just put a big fucking fireball

1713
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:14,580
and the sky.
I mean it's basically like a,

1714
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:16,220
like a fireplace.
How crazy.

1715
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,040
How crazy that it works.
So good.

1716
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:20,900
It's crazy work.
So good.

1717
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:22,220
Yeah.
Well,

1718
01:19:22,221 --> 01:19:25,280
it's one of the arguments that really
dumb people use for religion.

1719
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:29,520
Like what are the odds that all this
worked out perfectly?

1720
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,400
That we're this close to the sun.
I mean,

1721
01:19:31,401 --> 01:19:32,450
come on,
man.

1722
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:35,330
Scientists are trying to keep the
creator from EU.

1723
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:40,460
Japan is trying to land in unmanned
robot on an asteroid twice the distance

1724
01:19:40,461 --> 01:19:42,980
of the sun.
It's a 186 million miles away.

1725
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:45,080
Whoa.
It next month,

1726
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:46,100
next year,
next month.

1727
01:19:46,101 --> 01:19:48,180
They're going to be.
We're going to try and land on it.

1728
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:52,180
Raced the Japanese.
I didn't even know they were in this

1729
01:19:52,181 --> 01:19:54,420
space game.
It's orbiting it right now apparently.

1730
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:56,040
Well,
the Japanese have the hymn of worry.

1731
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:59,480
Eight satellite.
That takes gigantic high resolution.

1732
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:04,590
A full photos of the earth from 22,000
miles out every 10 minutes.

1733
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,060
Somewhere around then.
Oh

1734
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:08,700
yeah,
yeah.

1735
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,660
Well,
pull that up to him of worry.

1736
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:11,640
Eight.
What are the.

1737
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,250
What's the details of the memoir?
A,

1738
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:16,320
it's one of the best things to use
against these flat earth dorks.

1739
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:20,520
Like for the longest time,
one of the things they were saying is

1740
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:24,060
that there was no full photos of the
earth from space that everything was

1741
01:20:24,061 --> 01:20:27,240
just stitched together.
They don't know.

1742
01:20:27,241 --> 01:20:31,260
Jack Shit is so fucking stupid.
It's such a scary stupid theory.

1743
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,510
Real time is real time.
I look.

1744
01:20:33,511 --> 01:20:35,550
It's nighttime.
How far away is the distance?

1745
01:20:35,551 --> 01:20:39,270
The hamawand say I think it's 22,000
miles.

1746
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,000
Him a worry.
Eight.

1747
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:42,990
That's a satellite.

1748
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:50,390
The satellite is 22,000 miles above the
earth and it takes real time.

1749
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:53,310
Photos every 10 minutes and high
resolution.

1750
01:20:53,311 --> 01:20:55,650
They're like massive,
massive photographs,

1751
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:58,470
but they use it to predict weather and
you can like.

1752
01:20:58,471 --> 01:21:02,500
You could literally see storms coming in
and share so bad ass at it.

1753
01:21:02,501 --> 01:21:06,540
Look how he zoom in and zoom out.
Know I had no idea the Japanese were

1754
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:07,231
doing all this.
Oh,

1755
01:21:07,231 --> 01:21:08,180
they're on the ball,
son.

1756
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:12,060
They make the best cars.
The cars don't break your fucking around

1757
01:21:12,061 --> 01:21:13,690
with these teslas.
That shit's going to run out of

1758
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:15,900
batteries in the desert.
Gonna be stuck.

1759
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:19,200
You're going to be with chapped lips
like a Mad Max movie.

1760
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:22,020
Just shuffling,
trying to get to Nevada.

1761
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,020
Trinity's trying to charge my car with a
phone.

1762
01:21:25,021 --> 01:21:26,580
I have credit cards.
You could have.

1763
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:31,581
My credit cards is giving me water
from California,

1764
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:33,370
so I'm kind of queer here.

1765
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:38,640
It worked for queer this up.
I'm just listing my footprint.

1766
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:42,030
Electric car guys.
How'd that work out?

1767
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:45,510
Where your conflict minerals.
Electric car.

1768
01:21:45,511 --> 01:21:49,140
You paid shit.
I just tried to be nice to have a planet

1769
01:21:49,141 --> 01:21:51,540
guys.
How could those cars not run on solar

1770
01:21:51,541 --> 01:21:52,800
power?
That's what I don't get.

1771
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,060
Especially in California.
Like everything.

1772
01:21:55,061 --> 01:21:57,270
Solar.
Why don't you have a solar roof panel

1773
01:21:57,271 --> 01:21:59,070
and so on.
The car itself,

1774
01:21:59,071 --> 01:22:01,450
you regenerate the battery hood should
be solar.

1775
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,460
Oh yeah,
you're right.

1776
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,790
Oh my God.
Look at all the known asteroids from

1777
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:08,100
1999 to 2018.
What?

1778
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,690
Whoa.
Fuck.

1779
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:13,230
We live in a shooting gallery.
Look at NASA is identified more than

1780
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:17,710
18,000 near Earth objects.
They're just floating around all three

1781
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,170
rate.
Hold on back that up again.

1782
01:22:19,171 --> 01:22:21,300
The discovery rate averages.
What did it say?

1783
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:25,680
Forty per week.
It's asteroids.

1784
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:28,080
Oh my God.
Hold on.

1785
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,040
Back Up.
Back Up.

1786
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:32,430
Chance of a large earth asteroid hitting
earth is slim.

1787
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,850
What?
But scientists will continue to monitor

1788
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:38,260
all known near Earth objects for any
potential collusion with us.

1789
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,170
They say with slim,
you know what?

1790
01:22:40,171 --> 01:22:42,230
Until you know,
I was talking to this one sign,

1791
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:42,990
look at that,
right?

1792
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:44,550
I was talking to this one scientist and
he was like,

1793
01:22:44,551 --> 01:22:45,490
well,
you know,

1794
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:50,400
they already have plans in effect if
they find asteroids.

1795
01:22:50,401 --> 01:22:52,050
It's not something that I'm concerned
with.

1796
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,720
They're already thinking about that and
I think we'll be fine.

1797
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:57,060
So then I talked to Neil degrasse Tyson
and I said,

1798
01:22:57,061 --> 01:23:00,570
how much time would we need to plan for
a satellite or an asteroid hitting us?

1799
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:01,710
He goes,
at least 10 years.

1800
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:02,610
Like,
what?

1801
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,230
Ten years ago?
Ten years.

1802
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:04,951
And he goes,
yeah,

1803
01:23:04,951 --> 01:23:05,711
I go,
so we're fucked.

1804
01:23:05,711 --> 01:23:06,070
He goes,
we'd

1805
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,210
be fucked.
I'm like,

1806
01:23:07,211 --> 01:23:10,290
no,
this other guy lied to me.

1807
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:14,140
What do you mean 10 years from when?
From when you find it to when we could

1808
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:15,430
figure out a way to stop it.
Oh,

1809
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:19,800
that it would take us to 10 years.
You're not so figure out towards earth.

1810
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:24,850
You need 10 years gap time between
recognizing it's definitely gonna hit

1811
01:23:24,851 --> 01:23:29,260
earth and having the ability and the
technology to shift its direction.

1812
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,060
Couldn't you just go and shoot a rocket
at it?

1813
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:31,781
No,
Bro.

1814
01:23:31,781 --> 01:23:34,390
When that doesn't work,
that's what had happened in that movie.

1815
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:37,000
Which one?
Deep impact or arm again?

1816
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:38,260
The Will Smith one,
right?

1817
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,140
Oh,
so armageddon was a wilson though.

1818
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:41,450
So Samuel Jackson.
I know.

1819
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,000
Which one was Samuel Jackson the
president.

1820
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,380
Was it Morgan Freeman?
Morgan.

1821
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,600
Morgan Freeman.
Did they give up on the me too against

1822
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:51,580
him.
It seems like they let it go and I think

1823
01:23:51,581 --> 01:23:52,414
so.
Yeah.

1824
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,870
They tested the waters.
Leave me alone.

1825
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,160
Don't do any.
What do you think about this Louis ck

1826
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:01,920
thing?
Seek has returned and came back arms.

1827
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:03,790
Everybody's going crazy.
Crowds on again.

1828
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:06,790
Did a go to Carleton against page.
Pull out his,

1829
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:09,220
uh,
his instagram that again,

1830
01:24:09,221 --> 01:24:12,460
who has the best instagram page?
The best.

1831
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:14,740
It's the best.
If you're not going there it sound

1832
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:18,730
trucks and graduating Louis,
C K for his volume.

1833
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:20,790
Hey,
lily trumped level.

1834
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:21,830
What you did.
The comedy club.

1835
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:25,190
Terrific.
Nobody doing what was happening until

1836
01:24:25,191 --> 01:24:26,690
you were standing right in front of
them.

1837
01:24:26,691 --> 01:24:29,820
Spewing out your bit.
Dariel Joe.

1838
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:31,670
Well,
thank you sir.

1839
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,070
I didn't ask at what if they wanted to
see it.

1840
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:37,070
You gave them no choice but to watch you
work at.

1841
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:41,230
I just went there to do some jokes are
good job.

1842
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:42,790
You know.
People are like,

1843
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:44,110
oh,
too soon.

1844
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:45,230
I'm on stage for

1845
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,040
you.
Shouldn't doctor about the elephant in

1846
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:47,874
the room though?
Okay.

1847
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:52,980
Stood up the stuff they like that just
flew in from California at Boyer byobs.

1848
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:58,150
Tired but jack it up in the air.
Everybody was drafted there for is to

1849
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,220
watch.
Be Dope.

1850
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:03,910
No Way.
You're crazy.

1851
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:05,650
Show

1852
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:06,710
cookie.
I had a gun.

1853
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:07,770
Okay.
Yeah,

1854
01:25:07,771 --> 01:25:09,860
me too.
Me Too.

1855
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:11,483
A

1856
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,220
so damn to kyle.
Done it on my old roommate.

1857
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,420
Is He your real job?
And I for sure.

1858
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:28,020
Did you guys live together?
New York City,

1859
01:25:28,021 --> 01:25:28,830
you know,
Shit.

1860
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:33,060
Horrible.
One bedroom apartment had no doors.

1861
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:34,500
Okay.
I was on a food time.

1862
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:36,340
He was in the back.
We had no windows.

1863
01:25:36,341 --> 01:25:38,130
It was covered with roaches.
Wow.

1864
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,230
No sink in the bathroom.
Look at you now,

1865
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:43,830
making bread on TV.
It gets mocking the president and then

1866
01:25:43,831 --> 01:25:46,220
one of the best comedians.
So.

1867
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,160
Great.
Oh,

1868
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:51,180
what a mess.
What a mess.

1869
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,760
What do you think about this?
Some people don't want him to come back.

1870
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:58,630
Some people think they should be allowed
to come back and he served time off and,

1871
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,050
and then the argument by a lot of women
is.

1872
01:26:01,051 --> 01:26:02,940
Yeah,
but he hasn't said anything like he had

1873
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:03,980
one on anything.

1874
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:04,940
Yeah.
What is,

1875
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,860
what,
you know,

1876
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:08,630
what shows that he's learned?
Anything.

1877
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:10,760
Like what?
What should you have to do?

1878
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:12,843
I don't know.
I mean,

1879
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:14,560
Louise Very smart.
I'm sure he'll,

1880
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:17,350
if he wants to keep doing it after this
reception,

1881
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:20,350
he'll probably come out with some
statement or do something.

1882
01:26:20,351 --> 01:26:22,900
I don't know.
But the reality is,

1883
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:26,200
uh,
what did he lose?

1884
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:29,590
They took away networks,
took away his stuff.

1885
01:26:29,591 --> 01:26:32,770
Just film distributors weren't going to
put out as film.

1886
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:33,371
Well,
the film,

1887
01:26:33,371 --> 01:26:34,510
but as a comedian

1888
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:35,590
from,
by all accounts,

1889
01:26:35,591 --> 01:26:37,990
the film was shit.
Anybody has seen the film?

1890
01:26:37,991 --> 01:26:40,720
I haven't seen it.
I have a few friends that saw.

1891
01:26:40,721 --> 01:26:42,550
They're like,
it's just so creepy and weird,

1892
01:26:42,551 --> 01:26:43,480
especially in light of

1893
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,890
what he was doing.
Yeah.

1894
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,200
It's just like,
no,

1895
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:47,980
but regardless whether it was good or
not,

1896
01:26:47,981 --> 01:26:51,310
I'm just saying like the industry said,
Fx said,

1897
01:26:51,311 --> 01:26:54,630
I'm taking this show from you ago,
said we're taking this stuff on Netflix.

1898
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:57,280
We're taking this off,
but it's definitely definitely lost

1899
01:26:57,310 --> 01:26:58,780
money financially.
But.

1900
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:02,100
And those are entities that were
companies

1901
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:06,730
that punishment or is that them
exercising their desire to not work with

1902
01:27:06,731 --> 01:27:09,280
someone who has been accused of
something that they don't want to be

1903
01:27:09,281 --> 01:27:11,200
associated with?
Is that a punishment?

1904
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:13,030
I don't know.
It seems to me that they're,

1905
01:27:13,031 --> 01:27:16,750
they're making a decision of who they
work with and who they're not work with.

1906
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:18,420
It affects him negative.

1907
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:20,610
Sure.
But it's not necessarily a punishment.

1908
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:21,563
Well,
there's,

1909
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:24,570
I don't know.
I think it would feel like a punishment.

1910
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:27,330
Sure.
But my point is there's these entities

1911
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:31,920
that can prevent him from making a
living as a comedian though he can walk

1912
01:27:31,921 --> 01:27:36,900
into a garage and if he has fans,
they're going to come see him.

1913
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:39,450
He has.
He has that under his control.

1914
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:42,150
Right.
Nobody can stop that,

1915
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,880
nobody,
so he can do it.

1916
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:47,130
It's up to him whether he wants to or
not.

1917
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:50,340
It's up to his fans whether they show up
or not and it's up to the people that

1918
01:27:50,341 --> 01:27:53,410
hate what he did and I'm really against
them to not go,

1919
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:55,410
well,
that's why this thing was weird,

1920
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:59,250
but he just showed up with a seller
which is like his favorite place to go

1921
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,220
and he just worked out material in the
audience.

1922
01:28:02,221 --> 01:28:06,090
Like Kyle was saying is just they're
trapped in there and they can't get out.

1923
01:28:06,091 --> 01:28:08,010
They,
they didn't have an option to say.

1924
01:28:08,011 --> 01:28:08,844
I don't want to see

1925
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:10,970
really interesting.
All the different spins though.

1926
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:16,060
All the different women spins and w one
one really bizarre spin that I saw was

1927
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:21,440
this woman was saying that this is
indicative of the problem of all comedy

1928
01:28:21,441 --> 01:28:26,441
clubs and aggressive male audience and
women sitting there feeling threatened,

1929
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:30,120
not being able to use their voice and
like use user voice.

1930
01:28:30,121 --> 01:28:32,840
Like what are you gonna heckle?
They were saying like you like you would

1931
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,490
be more empowered if there were more
women,

1932
01:28:34,491 --> 01:28:37,580
so you could heckle is.
That's not cool,

1933
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:39,380
like you're not supposed to do that at a
comedy club,

1934
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:42,560
have you.
Don't like someone just don't laugh,

1935
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:45,620
but
here's the thing.

1936
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:50,770
It's not your job or it's not your place
to say that you don't like someone when

1937
01:28:51,141 --> 01:28:53,890
the other people do like it.
You know if you're right,

1938
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:56,270
if you're going to get up and walk out.
Yeah,

1939
01:28:56,271 --> 01:28:58,700
just like you're going to see a movie
like you're an audience member,

1940
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,040
right?
The deal is you're not there to perform.

1941
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:05,100
The audience is there to just sit there
and laugh or not laugh,

1942
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:07,800
but don't be rude to the other people
that are enjoying it.

1943
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:10,800
So as soon as you break your
sensibilities above,

1944
01:29:10,801 --> 01:29:14,070
the rest of the audience will your
problem you've made.

1945
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,420
If you decide like,
hey,

1946
01:29:15,421 --> 01:29:17,100
I didn't like this,
I'm going to go home and write about it,

1947
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:18,150
that's totally your prerogative.

1948
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:19,840
That's fine.
Get up and walk out.

1949
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:20,610
That's fine.

1950
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:23,040
Go somewhere else and talk about it on
stage yourself.

1951
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:27,750
Nothing wrong with any of those things,
but this one woman's take was like women

1952
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:29,600
don't feel like they have.
They can.

1953
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:32,850
They have the ability to speak out about
it.

1954
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,770
I'm like,
speak out like so you're saying like to

1955
01:29:34,771 --> 01:29:35,401
heckle,
Hey,

1956
01:29:35,401 --> 01:29:39,480
I don't want you on stage.
I know everything about you and your

1957
01:29:39,481 --> 01:29:43,110
story and I want you to perform in front
of me.

1958
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:44,490
Even those other people that are
laughing,

1959
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,490
right,
and that these aggressive men were

1960
01:29:47,491 --> 01:29:49,050
yelling,
good to see you back.

1961
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:51,640
Louis aggressive men like,
well,

1962
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:55,350
okay.
That's like there's a framing of this

1963
01:29:55,440 --> 01:30:00,300
and this is one of its becomes this male
versus female framing that sort of

1964
01:30:00,301 --> 01:30:04,170
represents aggressive men,
sexual men doing things to women they

1965
01:30:04,171 --> 01:30:06,780
don't want.
The women are sitting there in silence.

1966
01:30:06,781 --> 01:30:09,960
They don't want to be there and they
don't have a voice because they feel

1967
01:30:09,961 --> 01:30:13,950
overwhelmed and overpopulated or a
outnumbered

1968
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:18,230
flurry.
Problem is those guys that Harvey and

1969
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:23,320
him and Matt Lauer and people like that.
They are the poster boys for that,

1970
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:29,340
so they're going to be watched very
closely and how does many of our fitting

1971
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:30,174
into that

1972
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:32,880
confused by this one?
By all accounts,

1973
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:37,910
Matt Lauer had affairs right in the
office with girls who worked with them.

1974
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:41,910
So what was inappropriate that as he was
having sex with his staff.

1975
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:42,680
Right?

1976
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,270
Right.
But he was also hitting on people that

1977
01:30:44,271 --> 01:30:46,010
didn't want to be hit on was in his
office.

1978
01:30:46,011 --> 01:30:47,870
Yeah.
That was the accusations.

1979
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,580
Yeah.
It wasn't just,

1980
01:30:49,581 --> 01:30:51,590
he was dating them.
He was also,

1981
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,060
you know,
making,

1982
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:56,400
making weird advancements in the office.
Yeah.

1983
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,800
That all these guys,
all these guys,

1984
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:03,110
you know,
they're all very complicated.

1985
01:31:03,111 --> 01:31:06,750
They're all very fuzzy kind of things.
But uh,

1986
01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:08,720
you know,
those guys are going to be watched very

1987
01:31:08,721 --> 01:31:11,480
closely as you see.
Louie just goes to this little club and

1988
01:31:11,481 --> 01:31:14,270
does a set and it's national news and
national debate.

1989
01:31:14,271 --> 01:31:15,590
It's like,
it's,

1990
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:19,370
it's a,
it's heady stuff.

1991
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:20,580
Teddy stuff.
Yeah.

1992
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:25,760
What's fascinating is that as a culture,
we're going through this great time of

1993
01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:30,790
change in this great time of a
introspective thinking and of observing

1994
01:31:34,941 --> 01:31:39,830
our behavior and discussing our behavior
and watching this,

1995
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:42,770
like you have the worst case examples of
which my,

1996
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:43,970
in my opinion,
is cosby.

1997
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:46,460
Worst case example,
drugging people.

1998
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:48,050
I mean,
there's,

1999
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:50,390
there's a woman who was on television on
CNN.

2000
01:31:50,391 --> 01:31:53,990
She said something that freaked me out
when she said that is entirely possible

2001
01:31:53,991 --> 01:31:58,070
that bill cosby is the,
the most prolific serial rapist in

2002
01:31:58,071 --> 01:32:01,210
history.
And that's a big statement I heard that

2003
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,530
I want.
Maybe she's right.

2004
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:04,780
She's right.
Like how many,

2005
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:07,630
how many people does a regular rapist
raped before they get caught?

2006
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:08,573
Yeah,

2007
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:11,010
just,
I mean that's the number that came out

2008
01:32:11,011 --> 01:32:13,320
against him.
I'm sure there's other people that you

2009
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:14,220
had.

2010
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:15,270
Yeah.
That's crazy.

2011
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:18,140
That's like the far end of the spectrum.
Right?

2012
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:19,890
And then on the other end of the
spectrum,

2013
01:32:19,891 --> 01:32:22,660
you've got like Louis [inaudible] who's,
um,

2014
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:27,230
did something definitely you wouldn't
want to happen to your wife know where

2015
01:32:27,231 --> 01:32:28,560
your kids,
your kids,

2016
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:31,910
but your friends.
I don't know the whole story.

2017
01:32:31,911 --> 01:32:34,830
You know,
Kurt Kurt Metzger was telling me that

2018
01:32:34,831 --> 01:32:37,410
one of the girls who came out against
him,

2019
01:32:37,411 --> 01:32:42,110
like they had been flirting like the
whole weekend and talking about sex like

2020
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:44,700
the whole weekend.
And then he did that and then he had

2021
01:32:44,701 --> 01:32:47,910
sent the girl a text saying,
I'm really sorry that I did that.

2022
01:32:47,911 --> 01:32:49,230
And she said,
don't worry about it.

2023
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:51,120
Look,
we were talking about sex all weekend

2024
01:32:51,570 --> 01:32:56,460
and then when the accusations came out,
obviously there was more accusations

2025
01:32:56,461 --> 01:32:59,910
that seemed to be more egregious.
She threw her hat into the mix as well.

2026
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,650
Right.
I don't know if that's true or not

2027
01:33:01,651 --> 01:33:03,270
though.
The problem with a lot of these stories

2028
01:33:03,271 --> 01:33:05,010
is you're hearing them third,
fourth,

2029
01:33:05,011 --> 01:33:06,780
fifth hand,
you don't,

2030
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:10,020
you know,
all you know is he said those stories

2031
01:33:10,021 --> 01:33:14,460
are true and that he recognized that he
did something wrong and he was going to

2032
01:33:14,461 --> 01:33:16,890
take time off.
So that to me is not a guy defending

2033
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:18,420
himself.
That's a guy saying,

2034
01:33:18,450 --> 01:33:19,950
yeah,
I definitely fucked up.

2035
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:23,670
I'm going to step back.
So he steps back for nine months or

2036
01:33:23,671 --> 01:33:26,280
whatever it was.
And people saying that's not long

2037
01:33:26,281 --> 01:33:28,650
enough.
You didn't do anything like you gotta.

2038
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:31,920
So what,
what should someone do?

2039
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:36,120
Like in one of the things that Michael,
Ian Black said on twitter before they

2040
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:39,510
told his Dick off,
stuffed it in his nose,

2041
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:45,870
that was a crazy thing to watch because
he's like super progressive,

2042
01:33:45,871 --> 01:33:48,030
very liberal.
And he was saying that,

2043
01:33:48,031 --> 01:33:50,780
you know,
like that me too has to offer men of

2044
01:33:50,781 --> 01:33:54,990
road to redemption and you know,
and a lot of these women were saying

2045
01:33:54,991 --> 01:33:57,360
though,
like every road to redemption begins

2046
01:33:57,361 --> 01:33:58,410
with.
I'm sorry,

2047
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:01,320
which is a very valid point,
very valid point.

2048
01:34:01,321 --> 01:34:02,580
Like you should,
you should have to say,

2049
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,260
I'm sorry,
you know,

2050
01:34:04,261 --> 01:34:06,060
and I think he's said,
I'm sorry,

2051
01:34:06,061 --> 01:34:08,250
but I don't know what he said to the
women.

2052
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:11,250
I don't know what he said.
I don't mean you had to one public

2053
01:34:11,251 --> 01:34:12,570
statement,
did he say I'm sorry.

2054
01:34:12,571 --> 01:34:13,710
And that what public statement,

2055
01:34:14,030 --> 01:34:16,830
that times article is kind of like a
availed.

2056
01:34:16,831 --> 01:34:17,820
I'm sorry,
I think,

2057
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:20,040
I don't know that it's,
I don't know,

2058
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:23,160
you know,
I hesitate to comment on any of it

2059
01:34:23,161 --> 01:34:28,161
because it's like his mess and like if
anyone that comments on it or it comes

2060
01:34:28,231 --> 01:34:30,510
near it or like the,
the owner of the comedy cellar,

2061
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:33,030
everyone's got to deal with the
aftermath,

2062
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,880
the aftermath of what this guy did.
It's like,

2063
01:34:35,881 --> 01:34:38,970
why am I as the owner of the seller,
it's like,

2064
01:34:39,150 --> 01:34:42,450
why is he have to get brought into
Louise Behavior?

2065
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:47,210
I saw at least a half a dozen articles
written about what a piece of Shit

2066
01:34:47,210 --> 01:34:51,680
Michael Che was for saying that he,
Louis deserves the opportunity to make a

2067
01:34:51,681 --> 01:34:52,710
living.
Right.

2068
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:56,200
Right.
Going after Michael Che and his is

2069
01:34:56,210 --> 01:34:57,500
useless,
like,

2070
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:01,611
you know,
but look,

2071
01:35:01,611 --> 01:35:04,190
it's there.
They're allowed their opinion that

2072
01:35:04,191 --> 01:35:05,810
Michael Che's opinions useless.
I mean,

2073
01:35:05,811 --> 01:35:07,700
this is one of the beautiful things
about free expression

2074
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:08,870
now complete.
That's what,

2075
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:11,660
that's what I'm,
that's where it's kind of the most

2076
01:35:11,661 --> 01:35:14,570
interesting for me.
And I don't mean that I take pleasure in

2077
01:35:14,571 --> 01:35:16,970
any of this because it's horrible for
everyone involved.

2078
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:19,490
But uh,
it's interesting.

2079
01:35:19,491 --> 01:35:22,700
Like I said,
there's companies that probably won't go

2080
01:35:22,701 --> 01:35:25,310
back into business with him,
but as a comedian,

2081
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:27,500
you know,
he could put a show up in the park,

2082
01:35:27,501 --> 01:35:29,210
he could put a show up anywhere he
wants.

2083
01:35:29,211 --> 01:35:32,600
It's really up to him and people can
protest it.

2084
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:35,480
They can not show up.
They can buy tickets by the thousands.

2085
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:40,750
It's going to be interesting to see when
he takes that part of his earning and

2086
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:45,890
that part of his life in his own hands,
you really can't stop him.

2087
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:48,170
Yeah,
I'm in that way.

2088
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:52,190
It's like it's how you frame it,
so I don't think,

2089
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:57,380
I don't think louise a bad guy at all.
I think what Louis is a pervert and I

2090
01:35:57,381 --> 01:35:58,730
think he's,
you know,

2091
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:03,230
he's into,
I think part of it is like being naughty

2092
01:36:03,231 --> 01:36:05,720
and doing something that's forbidden and
you know,

2093
01:36:05,721 --> 01:36:10,721
in getting away with it and having these
girls like him for being a comedian and

2094
01:36:11,241 --> 01:36:14,690
then doing that to them.
I mean this is just my speculation.

2095
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:18,650
There's a lot of weirdness to it,
but I don't think that he's like,

2096
01:36:19,410 --> 01:36:23,090
I'm an angry person and I don't think
he's trying to be hurtful.

2097
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:27,410
I don't think any of that was.
I think it was just terrible judgment.

2098
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:31,700
Everything.
I mean you could say a lot about it.

2099
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:34,520
That's fucked up,
but it's like what it is,

2100
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:37,420
is not.
He's not like,

2101
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,080
he's not trying to hurt people.

2102
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:44,180
I think he's just fucking weird.
You mean let's think about what it is

2103
01:36:44,181 --> 01:36:46,280
he's asking.
Can I jerk off in front of you?

2104
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:47,690
Like it's the whole.
I mean,

2105
01:36:47,691 --> 01:36:49,090
it's like,
yeah,

2106
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:54,250
when it comes to that kind of creepy
shit is like the most considerate way to

2107
01:36:54,981 --> 01:36:57,440
approach it.
[inaudible] can I jerk off in front of

2108
01:36:57,441 --> 01:37:00,680
you?
And he's like literally asking adorable,

2109
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:03,760
so fucked up.
I mean,

2110
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:06,260
it is a mess.
I'm not diminishing the effect that it

2111
01:37:06,261 --> 01:37:08,220
would have on a woman who respects them
and wants,

2112
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:10,220
you know,
she just thinks that he's our friend and

2113
01:37:10,221 --> 01:37:11,570
next thing you know,
he's got his dick out.

2114
01:37:11,571 --> 01:37:13,610
Like I get it.
I'm not saying that's not what I'm

2115
01:37:13,611 --> 01:37:14,160
saying.

2116
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,900
It's a weird thing because you don't
want.

2117
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:20,520
Those women were obviously very hurt and
there's degrees of like,

2118
01:37:20,521 --> 01:37:22,530
oh,
they see texted this or they said that

2119
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:27,450
to go out and do that to somebody in a
powerful position and come out and say

2120
01:37:27,451 --> 01:37:30,540
it and know that you're going to get
hate from the world.

2121
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:34,230
They were,
they were in a place that they were hurt

2122
01:37:34,231 --> 01:37:37,080
enough that they felt that they had to
say something and do something.

2123
01:37:37,110 --> 01:37:40,230
Sure.
And you just want like on this personal

2124
01:37:40,231 --> 01:37:42,060
level,
you want them to be okay.

2125
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:43,320
Right?
You want everybody to be okay.

2126
01:37:43,321 --> 01:37:48,270
You want them to be okay and feel like
they had justice and for coming out,

2127
01:37:48,271 --> 01:37:49,980
being brave enough to come out and say
something.

2128
01:37:49,981 --> 01:37:52,560
But you also want to protect people from
that happening again,

2129
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:53,483
but.
Right,

2130
01:37:53,670 --> 01:37:54,610
right.
The

2131
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,190
only way,
one of the only ways,

2132
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:00,840
just like you got to kind of,
you know this and there was,

2133
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:02,700
there was a,
there's definitely a feeling,

2134
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:04,410
you know,
the,

2135
01:38:04,450 --> 01:38:07,740
the comedy world is separate and we're
kind of like,

2136
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:10,120
you know,
it's a crazy environment and nightclub

2137
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:13,200
kind of a thing.
And what you heard when these ones,

2138
01:38:13,201 --> 01:38:18,201
these women came out was now this is
kind of inappropriate that girls,

2139
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:22,110
women can,
can't come into a club and just feel

2140
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:24,060
okay.
Like they have to field all this stuff

2141
01:38:24,061 --> 01:38:27,030
and guys hitting on them all the time.
Like it kind of made you look at the

2142
01:38:27,031 --> 01:38:31,260
scene and be like alright maybe this
scene could be cleaned up a little bit

2143
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:32,183
as well.

2144
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:37,220
It's like what I was saying about really
a worse version of working out at a gay

2145
01:38:37,221 --> 01:38:40,520
gym.
So if you go to a gay gym and you see

2146
01:38:40,521 --> 01:38:44,540
men Leer at you get that feeling that
these guys want to have sex with you and

2147
01:38:44,541 --> 01:38:46,070
you definitely don't want to have sex
with them.

2148
01:38:46,490 --> 01:38:49,190
That is how women feel all the time.

2149
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:51,730
Yeah.
And you're coming to the comedy store or

2150
01:38:51,731 --> 01:38:55,480
wherever and you're trying to just start
out as a comic and that's such a big

2151
01:38:55,481 --> 01:38:58,330
thing already.
And then you throw a whole nother level

2152
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:01,960
layer on it that everyone's hitting on
you from the doorman to the headliner.

2153
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:05,980
That's gotta be a big thing and it's
like.

2154
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:09,190
So I think that those women should feel
good,

2155
01:39:09,191 --> 01:39:12,550
that it.
It definitely made an impact.

2156
01:39:12,551 --> 01:39:14,980
They should know that they've been heard
and that they,

2157
01:39:15,070 --> 01:39:17,770
they,
they shined a light on something that

2158
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:22,480
even people that were in it,
men that were in it were unaware of.

2159
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,010
Yeah,
they were definitely heard.

2160
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:28,710
It's very difficult for people to
consider really objectively consider

2161
01:39:28,711 --> 01:39:31,170
other people's perspectives.
Like really,

2162
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,460
people consider it in a convenient way.
Like,

2163
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:36,390
you know,
like they know what they can get away

2164
01:39:36,391 --> 01:39:38,850
with what they do.
They really consider how the other

2165
01:39:38,851 --> 01:39:42,510
person feels and thinks and you know,
and that's on both sides.

2166
01:39:42,511 --> 01:39:44,670
It's hard.
There's inconsiderate women is

2167
01:39:44,671 --> 01:39:46,580
inconsiderate men and you know,
we,

2168
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:51,180
we both do it to each other and then
people develop bad traits and bad

2169
01:39:51,181 --> 01:39:55,200
associations with the opposite sex and
it's a very common thing that people do.

2170
01:39:55,680 --> 01:40:00,680
But I think situations where the
discussion is so emotionally charged

2171
01:40:03,031 --> 01:40:05,070
like this,
it's good for us.

2172
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:07,530
It's good for us.
It allows the,

2173
01:40:07,531 --> 01:40:09,810
this,
this public discourse.

2174
01:40:09,811 --> 01:40:12,090
It allows this public discussion of it.
Yeah.

2175
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:12,760
And,

2176
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:14,530
and there hasn't been like,
you know,

2177
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:19,960
people that have gotten hurt by that
have come out and said it,

2178
01:40:19,961 --> 01:40:23,650
like in our scene where they're like
nice people and they've been attacked.

2179
01:40:23,651 --> 01:40:25,570
It was very few,
but it was like,

2180
01:40:25,571 --> 01:40:27,370
hey,
there's some big important people in

2181
01:40:27,371 --> 01:40:30,290
this scene and they're acting in
appropriately and then,

2182
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:31,840
you know,
you're right.

2183
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:34,480
I think it's good.
It's definitely woken up and moved it

2184
01:40:34,481 --> 01:40:35,410
further.
Right.

2185
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:38,530
I have a funny daughter.
I know you have a funny daughter who

2186
01:40:38,531 --> 01:40:41,020
knows if they see our life and want to
go pursue it.

2187
01:40:41,021 --> 01:40:44,710
You want them to be able to go to a club
and not have to deal with a whole

2188
01:40:44,711 --> 01:40:47,290
nother.
It's enough when you're starting out to

2189
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:51,160
get five minutes of good material and to
get the audience to like you and get the

2190
01:40:51,161 --> 01:40:54,250
respect of your peers.
Then you got to have about someone

2191
01:40:54,251 --> 01:40:56,140
following you in the,
in the parking lot.

2192
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:59,380
I have a friend of mine who's a comic
and she got hit on by.

2193
01:40:59,381 --> 01:41:02,800
This other guy was a comic who shall
remain nameless.

2194
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:05,740
And uh,
she showed me some of the texts that he

2195
01:41:05,741 --> 01:41:07,810
sent her and I was like,
Holy Shit.

2196
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,310
All right.
And one of them was like,

2197
01:41:09,311 --> 01:41:12,090
I'm the only one that can make you calm
or something fucking crazy.

2198
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:13,570
I'm Jeez.

2199
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:16,670
Yeah.
It's,

2200
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:18,410
hey bro.
Yeah.

2201
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:22,240
But those.
So then it comes down to,

2202
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:25,120
okay,
so these women were heard.

2203
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:27,700
Obviously it's created a movement,
you know,

2204
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:31,210
but then it becomes on the other side it
becomes about.

2205
01:41:31,211 --> 01:41:35,740
But did this man's,
was he punished enough and do we have

2206
01:41:35,741 --> 01:41:39,250
control over whether or not he's allowed
to come back to the audience?

2207
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:41,580
Like for a woman,
like the,

2208
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:43,720
the thing about a guy being angry with
you,

2209
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,810
it carries that threat of physical
danger.

2210
01:41:48,190 --> 01:41:49,450
You know,
that's a different thing.

2211
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,930
I know.
I was thinking I was on a hike the other

2212
01:41:52,931 --> 01:41:56,680
day and I was thinking about that fine
line at the end of the night in a bar.

2213
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,820
Those meat head guys were trying to like
hit on girls and when it doesn't work

2214
01:42:00,821 --> 01:42:02,590
they decide they're just going to fight
instead.

2215
01:42:02,591 --> 01:42:04,210
Couldn't lesbian know that they're going
to fight.

2216
01:42:04,211 --> 01:42:07,570
Guys,
that's a fine line between,

2217
01:42:07,571 --> 01:42:08,110
you know what I mean?

2218
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:12,040
They're both almost violent acts.
It's like aggressively hitting on women

2219
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:13,420
and being like,
it's not going to happen.

2220
01:42:13,421 --> 01:42:15,520
Well screw it.
I don't like the way that has been

2221
01:42:15,521 --> 01:42:17,350
looking at.
I think it's just frustration,

2222
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:22,710
but you know it's traded but it.
But for looking at a male doing that,

2223
01:42:24,251 --> 01:42:28,810
like it isn't aggressive.
This is an aggressive animal here and a

2224
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:31,510
one minute he could've been.
I could've said yes and brought him home

2225
01:42:31,511 --> 01:42:34,210
with me when I said no.
And now he's punching that guy in the

2226
01:42:34,211 --> 01:42:39,211
parking lot though I don't want really a
common narrative whenever don't get

2227
01:42:39,341 --> 01:42:40,870
laid.
They try to hit on girls and they just

2228
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:42,040
beat the shit out of each other.
Yeah.

2229
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:43,390
It seems like it happens.
Oh,

2230
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:46,420
this fucking sucks.
It seems like it happens all the time.

2231
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:49,020
Oh,
there's such in my body and you know,

2232
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,340
when you're walking down the in the.

2233
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,600
Even in the village you're walking down
the street and there's just like an

2234
01:42:52,630 --> 01:42:56,800
angry frat group of guys just like
raging drunk,

2235
01:42:56,910 --> 01:42:59,590
you know,
they were trying to get laid at minutes

2236
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:00,251
earlier.
Yeah.

2237
01:43:00,251 --> 01:43:04,210
Male anchors my point.
My point being that there's men are

2238
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:09,300
formidable creatures and they're big and
they're hairy and there's why the 7

2239
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:11,800
billion people,
because men are gross and they shoot

2240
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:14,830
each other.
Everybody's shooting loads into people.

2241
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,770
Especially at your weightlifting gym.
I had a friend,

2242
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:21,710
a gay friend in,
in New York and that,

2243
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:24,640
what was the name of that gym there?
David Barton or something like that.

2244
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:26,080
What?
David Barton.

2245
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:28,510
It's some kind of health club in New
York.

2246
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:30,040
And it was,
it was,

2247
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:32,200
uh,
it was mostly gay men.

2248
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:34,300
And my friend said,
he said,

2249
01:43:34,301 --> 01:43:35,140
no,
you don't understand.

2250
01:43:35,141 --> 01:43:38,020
It's really,
I mean it's to the point where when

2251
01:43:38,021 --> 01:43:41,950
you're working out on the machine,
there are pin lights that come right

2252
01:43:41,951 --> 01:43:43,930
down on your bicep.
Like there,

2253
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:48,250
the lighting is made to make you look
sexy or while you're working out,

2254
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:52,280
it was the greatest team of all time.
They have like specific

2255
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:55,190
kind of lighting to Ross to a true.
Yeah,

2256
01:43:55,191 --> 01:43:56,840
we can back.
It was on a curling machine right now.

2257
01:43:56,841 --> 01:43:59,870
There'd be a light that came from the
ceiling like that hits where your biceps

2258
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:03,740
to make the shadows,
make the exit peaks look bigger.

2259
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:06,440
Yeah.
So it's about sex.

2260
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:09,290
Yeah.
You're working out.

2261
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:11,330
Well,
if you go to a regular gym,

2262
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:13,310
you see people hitting on each other all
the time.

2263
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,410
Yeah.
Yeah,

2264
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:16,010
of course.
Is that it?

2265
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:20,480
Even Barton Gym
one in Chelsea

2266
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:26,750
doesn't look sexy.
Bold was dumbbells.

2267
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:29,570
What is that?
It looks like a bar.

2268
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,480
What is that?
Oh,

2269
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:33,320
those are machines,
those cardio machines.

2270
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:35,840
Oh,
weird.

2271
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,840
Sex is a weird thing.
It is for sure.

2272
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:40,880
Well,
it's even weirder when it's packaged

2273
01:44:40,881 --> 01:44:44,290
with advertising and sleekness and music
and,

2274
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:47,810
and then you see it in real life and
people are tech sells baby and then on

2275
01:44:47,830 --> 01:44:50,870
their social media and everyone's
sticking their ass out and you know,

2276
01:44:50,871 --> 01:44:52,310
it's like there's so much going on.

2277
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:53,720
Yeah,
there's so much.

2278
01:44:53,721 --> 01:44:57,260
We're so overstimulated with sexual
imagery.

2279
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:01,820
Do you feel like you'll be grateful and
you're old and your sex drive is gone?

2280
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:03,980
No,
it'd be almost dead.

2281
01:45:03,981 --> 01:45:05,130
Then I'll be like,
sad.

2282
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:07,550
What do you hate?
Sex?

2283
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:11,000
No,
it's not about sex being bad.

2284
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:15,530
It's about being an asshole and it's
also about the shit roll.

2285
01:45:15,531 --> 01:45:18,470
The dice that you get.
If you're physically unattractive,

2286
01:45:18,471 --> 01:45:21,680
what's difficult to get someone who's
attracted to you that's hard to.

2287
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:25,670
That is hard.
That is inescapable reality of some

2288
01:45:25,671 --> 01:45:28,250
people's bodies.
Some people were just,

2289
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:33,690
they have bad genetics and then it must
be insanely frustrating.

2290
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:37,010
It's got to be frustrated,
but then you got to just find someone

2291
01:45:37,011 --> 01:45:37,940
else.
It's funny looking.

2292
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:42,890
Then you don't want them
to hit on you the way she hit on a

2293
01:45:42,891 --> 01:45:44,900
Michael Douglas movie.
Oh,

2294
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:45,960
come on,
champion.

2295
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:51,060
This disclosure movies,
do you know that people are mad that

2296
01:45:51,411 --> 01:45:54,650
someone's playing the elephant man,
but that they're enabled bodied person?

2297
01:45:55,130 --> 01:46:00,130
This is the most recent pc uproar that
they hired and able bodied actor to play

2298
01:46:00,531 --> 01:46:01,820
the elephant man.
Well,

2299
01:46:01,821 --> 01:46:04,880
how many elephant men are in the actor's
guild?

2300
01:46:05,790 --> 01:46:08,900
It's just exhausting.
It's exhausting keeping up with

2301
01:46:08,901 --> 01:46:11,090
everything.
Every.

2302
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:13,370
Everything is outrageous.
Everything.

2303
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:14,510
Yeah.
Well,

2304
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:16,280
this is the time.
Like you said,

2305
01:46:16,281 --> 01:46:20,600
like we're getting outraged and
discussions and then it'll kind of come

2306
01:46:20,601 --> 01:46:24,980
back to a normal stranger things and
elephant man remake criticized by

2307
01:46:24,981 --> 01:46:28,040
disability charity,
but you know what this is?

2308
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:30,260
Do you know you need a good actor?
Yeah,

2309
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:32,130
there's.
You just can't be happy.

2310
01:46:32,150 --> 01:46:34,010
And by the way,
here's the thing.

2311
01:46:34,011 --> 01:46:37,520
No disrespect to the disability charity,
but a lot of these disability charities

2312
01:46:37,521 --> 01:46:41,390
criticized this just so that they can
highlight their charity and it's very

2313
01:46:41,391 --> 01:46:44,630
good for the charity if they criticize
things because it makes people aware of

2314
01:46:44,631 --> 01:46:46,250
it,
it becomes a big public story and then

2315
01:46:46,251 --> 01:46:49,440
they get donations.
It's not bad for them to consider the

2316
01:46:49,441 --> 01:46:50,010
source.
I mean,

2317
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:54,030
they're probably just artists trying to
make the film and who knows if they're

2318
01:46:54,031 --> 01:46:55,800
good people,
then you know that they're going to

2319
01:46:55,801 --> 01:46:56,634
respect it.

2320
01:46:57,540 --> 01:47:01,500
No need disability person in their
person with disability to play a person

2321
01:47:01,501 --> 01:47:04,140
with disability period.
You piece of shit.

2322
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:07,500
But isn't that what?
Shut the fuck up and let people have

2323
01:47:07,501 --> 01:47:10,080
disability speak.
But I thought acting was pretending.

2324
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:15,110
How about something that you're not
first people of color speak then women

2325
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:17,550
of color,
then women,

2326
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:20,130
then gay,
lesbian,

2327
01:47:20,131 --> 01:47:22,680
straight trans,
bisexual,

2328
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:26,330
asexual,
intersexual venue.

2329
01:47:26,331 --> 01:47:29,300
You fucking white male bread making
piece of shit.

2330
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:32,560
I just make bread.
Leave me out of all of your crazy sex.

2331
01:47:32,561 --> 01:47:34,510
Condoms.
I don't know what's going on with all

2332
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:37,990
you guys.
Do you want to be an ally or not?

2333
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,030
You son of a bitch.
A look.

2334
01:47:40,330 --> 01:47:42,730
I'm just trying to show you the best
cupcakes in New York.

2335
01:47:42,970 --> 01:47:44,890
Oh,
what are you doing in la?

2336
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:46,880
You going to film in La?
Yeah,

2337
01:47:46,990 --> 01:47:49,060
we did vetoes.
Did vetoes pizza.

2338
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,340
Where did you go?
Was Vetoes Pizza Pizza,

2339
01:47:51,341 --> 01:47:53,560
right by Largo.
Between Largo and um,

2340
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:55,750
a good comedy store.
So good.

2341
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:58,200
Really?
This guy is a good pizza place in the

2342
01:47:58,210 --> 01:48:01,030
best pizza in La.
I'm telling you how good is.

2343
01:48:01,090 --> 01:48:03,250
He came from New Jersey.
His name is Vito.

2344
01:48:03,251 --> 01:48:06,100
He's sourdough startups in the water.
No,

2345
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:08,170
he says it's not about the water.
That's a farce.

2346
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:09,670
He goes,
you just have to know what you're doing.

2347
01:48:09,671 --> 01:48:14,671
He does have good ingredients.
His crest is impeccable because he knows

2348
01:48:14,831 --> 01:48:16,030
how to make the dough.
Wally.

2349
01:48:16,150 --> 01:48:17,410
Yeah,
this guy's legit.

2350
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:19,870
He's lying about it.
Now.

2351
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:23,620
Vetoes the real deal.
Females got trucks of water in his

2352
01:48:23,621 --> 01:48:25,300
backyard.
He's not telling nobody

2353
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:34,240
can veto the fucking meet Bob.
Oh,

2354
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:35,990
that looks so good.
So good.

2355
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:38,170
If I was going to go off my diet,
I would be not.

2356
01:48:38,171 --> 01:48:40,150
Meet saw.
So good.

2357
01:48:40,190 --> 01:48:42,880
Getting it looks very good as well.
Everything.

2358
01:48:42,881 --> 01:48:46,270
This guy makes this amazing.
Literally smelled like my grandmother's

2359
01:48:46,271 --> 01:48:46,680
house.

2360
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:50,030
Holy Veto.
You motherfucker in Quito.

2361
01:48:50,031 --> 01:48:53,580
Say solvay.
Fucking donuts.

2362
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:54,503
A veto.

2363
01:48:54,580 --> 01:48:56,350
Come on Joe,
and you're off it and we're at the

2364
01:48:56,351 --> 01:48:57,460
store.
We'll go to vetoes.

2365
01:48:57,461 --> 01:48:58,570
It's literally down the street.

2366
01:48:58,630 --> 01:49:00,150
I'm on it right now.
For how long?

2367
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:03,130
Strip?
Like I go on and off Iguana for a few

2368
01:49:03,130 --> 01:49:03,963
months,
I'll go off.

2369
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:06,280
Yeah.
I mean,

2370
01:49:06,340 --> 01:49:08,500
I mean occasionally I'll have a cheat
day and so I'll,

2371
01:49:08,530 --> 01:49:11,020
I'll,
it'll knock me out of Ketosis for a few

2372
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:12,790
hours and knocked me back just a few
hours.

2373
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:14,820
Yeah.
But right now I'm in a,

2374
01:49:14,890 --> 01:49:17,620
you would call it mild ketosis.
If you look at my pis strip,

2375
01:49:17,650 --> 01:49:22,150
I put it up on my instagram is a chart.
It shows you like the darkest to the

2376
01:49:22,151 --> 01:49:23,410
lightest.
Oh yeah.

2377
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:26,140
Yeah.
I'm in like a mid.

2378
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:29,530
Several been on it for five days,
six days.

2379
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:31,360
How do you feel?
I've always feel good.

2380
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:34,270
I get used to doing it.
I'm used to,

2381
01:49:34,271 --> 01:49:36,820
it seems to weird.
Seems like I'm not on that spectrum at

2382
01:49:36,821 --> 01:49:40,690
all because it dried out a little bit
before I put it up to what happens if

2383
01:49:40,691 --> 01:49:45,691
you eat a slice of vetoes,
it'll knock me down to that negative was

2384
01:49:46,511 --> 01:49:47,540
nothing back.

2385
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,930
I would call that one slice.
Yeah,

2386
01:49:50,030 --> 01:49:52,450
I would call it.
I'm somewhere in the range of moderate,

2387
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,030
moderate Ketosis,
moderate,

2388
01:49:55,031 --> 01:49:56,500
but again,
I pissed on him.

2389
01:49:56,501 --> 01:49:59,530
Then I let this trip sit for a little
bit and it dried and it looks a little

2390
01:49:59,531 --> 01:50:01,090
weird.
Disgusting.

2391
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:04,120
Anyway,
what it does for me though,

2392
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:09,220
it's very good for my appetite and
cognitive benefits like my mind feels

2393
01:50:09,221 --> 01:50:10,750
clear when you put them on it.
Yeah,

2394
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:13,150
that's interesting.
I think there's a certain amount of fog

2395
01:50:13,151 --> 01:50:15,640
that comes with carbohydrate consumption
too much.

2396
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:16,721
Yeah.
Well,

2397
01:50:16,721 --> 01:50:19,810
carbohydrate consumption in general and
when you,

2398
01:50:19,811 --> 01:50:24,070
when you eat carbohydrates post
carbohydrate consumption is a lack of

2399
01:50:24,071 --> 01:50:27,790
mental clarity,
like a down turn of the way your brain

2400
01:50:27,791 --> 01:50:30,050
functions,
what I call that sleep nap.

2401
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:32,710
Time nap,
eat sweet,

2402
01:50:32,711 --> 01:50:33,820
sweet nap time,
nap time.

2403
01:50:34,230 --> 01:50:36,220
When you and I contrast in many ways my
friend,

2404
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:38,460
I try and dial it in.
Yeah.

2405
01:50:38,470 --> 01:50:40,900
I don't eat this stuff all the time,
but you know.

2406
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:41,431
Yeah.
But he.

2407
01:50:41,431 --> 01:50:42,264
Look,
you love it.

2408
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:45,640
I do love nothing wrong with it.
I love the celebration of life and one

2409
01:50:45,641 --> 01:50:49,060
of my favorite dishes on planet earth is
linguine with clams.

2410
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:53,290
When I want to go off,
like when I was in Italy,

2411
01:50:53,291 --> 01:50:55,000
I was in Italy a couple of weeks ago.
Oh yeah.

2412
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:59,320
Where'd you go to everyday?
Ravello Ravello where's the Amalfi

2413
01:50:59,321 --> 01:51:01,900
coast?
Went to copper and we took a boat to

2414
01:51:01,901 --> 01:51:06,190
copper and we ate there and fucking
phenomenal food.

2415
01:51:06,191 --> 01:51:09,880
The food was outrageous.
So fresh clams with the sardines man

2416
01:51:09,881 --> 01:51:14,760
filets starting filets in olive oil.
So the best.

2417
01:51:14,761 --> 01:51:16,390
So.
Oh my God.

2418
01:51:16,391 --> 01:51:17,560
Oh,
good clams.

2419
01:51:17,561 --> 01:51:19,280
The clamp.
Everything was so fresh.

2420
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:21,720
But it was interesting.
They were um,

2421
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:25,420
a Valentine Thomas who is a professional
pr spear.

2422
01:51:25,421 --> 01:51:27,760
Fisher person.
She was on the other day and she was

2423
01:51:27,761 --> 01:51:31,720
saying that the oceans in that area are
completely overfished.

2424
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:33,181
Really?
Yeah.

2425
01:51:33,181 --> 01:51:35,560
That's like,
it's almost impossible for a regular

2426
01:51:35,561 --> 01:51:39,310
person to go there and catch a fish
that's Texas overfished everything.

2427
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:43,470
It's a bummer being alive now.
It's such a bummer that every,

2428
01:51:43,650 --> 01:51:45,820
everywhere you go,
it's always the end of whatever.

2429
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:49,690
It's the end of the coral reef.
It's the end of these animals running

2430
01:51:49,691 --> 01:51:52,750
through the woods at the end of such a
bummer.

2431
01:51:53,730 --> 01:51:56,140
You know,
like even like I tried to show my kids

2432
01:51:56,141 --> 01:51:59,800
like nice nature videos,
like I used to watch with my dad and

2433
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:02,560
everyone at the end is like,
but this is going away,

2434
01:52:02,561 --> 01:52:03,780
and I was just like,
ugh.

2435
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:06,220
It sucks.
Some of it is going away.

2436
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:07,950
Yeah,
most of it.

2437
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:14,140
I mean it's how you look at it.
It's like we're definitely in an

2438
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:16,930
unsustainable path,
right?

2439
01:52:16,931 --> 01:52:19,420
In terms of just what we're doing
agriculturally.

2440
01:52:19,421 --> 01:52:21,640
If you,
if you talk to farmers and you

2441
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,370
appreciate this,
what they do with large scale

2442
01:52:24,371 --> 01:52:27,460
agriculture,
you're not supposed to grow food in the

2443
01:52:27,461 --> 01:52:32,461
same plot of land for fucking 50 years.
Corn and just constantly soy,

2444
01:52:32,550 --> 01:52:36,670
throwing minerals on the ground and
constantly growing and then you get

2445
01:52:36,671 --> 01:52:39,370
these minerally deficient plants,
you know,

2446
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:41,310
they're just not the same and it's just
not.

2447
01:52:41,490 --> 01:52:44,720
It's not good for you.
That's the only thing is good for is

2448
01:52:44,730 --> 01:52:46,040
like deer because deer

2449
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,650
can combine,
eat all your corn when they want.

2450
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:50,780
You get a high population of deer in the
area,

2451
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:54,830
but you're not supposed to feed cattle
corn either.

2452
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:57,560
No.
It depends also like wildlife is

2453
01:52:57,561 --> 01:53:01,310
supposed to exist in like wildlife
habitat,

2454
01:53:01,311 --> 01:53:06,311
which is like forests and grasslands and
meadows and sun fed.

2455
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:08,960
Fed plants.
Yeah.

2456
01:53:08,961 --> 01:53:11,480
They're supposed to be wandering around
eating all these things.

2457
01:53:11,481 --> 01:53:16,290
They're not supposed to be existing in
these massive thousand Acre Cornfield,

2458
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:17,690
so great.
It's just weird.

2459
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:21,460
It's like white tailed deer.
To a certain extent.

2460
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:24,770
This country have become like farm
animals there go weird farm animal

2461
01:53:24,771 --> 01:53:26,090
that's not in a fence,
right?

2462
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:29,180
They're just always around farms.
Just eating farm food.

2463
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:29,941
Yeah.
Yeah.

2464
01:53:29,941 --> 01:53:33,800
Like my friend Doug had this interesting
thought about that.

2465
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:35,750
He was like,
these are.

2466
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:41,110
He goes to my cows are eating grass
because he has a farm barn.

2467
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:44,510
The cows are eating.
Those cows are natural,

2468
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:46,040
right?
They're organic.

2469
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:50,930
They're eating grass.
My dear are eating gmo corn who also the

2470
01:53:50,931 --> 01:53:53,180
deer that are on my property.
That desert wild.

2471
01:53:53,210 --> 01:53:56,780
The wild animals are not organic.
That's weird.

2472
01:53:56,781 --> 01:54:00,080
It's so crazy because you're eating
something that's totally unnatural for

2473
01:54:00,081 --> 01:54:01,850
them to eat,
which is gmo corn.

2474
01:54:01,851 --> 01:54:05,600
Corn is everywhere and it's gmo corn
because he's growing this corn.

2475
01:54:05,601 --> 01:54:06,530
That side.
Yeah.

2476
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:10,010
It's like Monsanto corn,
so he's growing this roundup fucking

2477
01:54:10,011 --> 01:54:12,650
sprayed corn.
She had these deer eating

2478
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:19,040
deer,
but yet the cows that are in captivity

2479
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:23,690
are grazing naturally grass and they're
a hundred percent organic.

2480
01:54:23,691 --> 01:54:24,740
She's.
It's weird,

2481
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:26,150
weird,
weird.

2482
01:54:26,570 --> 01:54:30,860
I was reading that,
that the whole fertilizer thing that we

2483
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:34,800
weren't able to get nitrogen out of the
air until this one scientist did it.

2484
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:36,500
Fritz Haber,
Fritz Haber.

2485
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:37,250
Yeah.
Those.

2486
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:40,220
The same guy who created Zyklon Nazi,
right?

2487
01:54:40,730 --> 01:54:41,301
No,
no.

2488
01:54:41,301 --> 01:54:43,970
He was a Jew.
It was a Jew is a Jew in Germany and he

2489
01:54:43,971 --> 01:54:45,390
was there in Germany.
Well,

2490
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:49,550
in World War One,
he was the guy who created the gas that

2491
01:54:49,551 --> 01:54:53,180
they use to spray on the allies and he
actually,

2492
01:54:53,181 --> 01:54:55,790
at the same time,
he created the hopper method for

2493
01:54:55,791 --> 01:54:58,520
extracting nitrogen from the atmosphere,
which led to,

2494
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:00,080
they think that the nitrogen and
people's.

2495
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:03,240
There's a great radio lab podcast on it.
Um,

2496
01:55:03,290 --> 01:55:08,290
I think it's called the bad show and it
shows how sometimes good people also do

2497
01:55:09,231 --> 01:55:12,170
horrible things.
And Fritz harbor was one of the ones

2498
01:55:12,171 --> 01:55:13,610
that they,
they highlighted.

2499
01:55:14,060 --> 01:55:18,830
But when he was,
when they were going to give him the

2500
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:22,400
Nobel prize for creating the harbor
method for extracting nitrogen from the

2501
01:55:22,401 --> 01:55:24,860
atmosphere,
and the air around us is 80 percent

2502
01:55:24,861 --> 01:55:26,630
nitrogen,
but you couldn't get it out right.

2503
01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:27,320
You couldn't get it out.

2504
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:29,060
He figured out how to get.
Like when we breed,

2505
01:55:29,061 --> 01:55:31,270
we think we breathing in oxygen mostly.
No,

2506
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:36,280
it's mostly nitrogen and then some
oxygen and he figured out how to get it

2507
01:55:36,531 --> 01:55:41,531
out and turn it into fertilizer and use
it in on soil and really increased

2508
01:55:41,901 --> 01:55:44,580
radically the amount of food that people
are able to grow.

2509
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:50,000
He also at the same time figured out how
to spray gas on on the troops,

2510
01:55:50,401 --> 01:55:52,470
so they wanted him for crimes against
humanity.

2511
01:55:52,471 --> 01:55:55,140
They wanted him for war crime at the
same time.

2512
01:55:55,141 --> 01:55:56,550
They were going to give him the Nobel
prize.

2513
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:59,550
Oh my God,
fucking car.

2514
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:04,580
And then they used his gas for the
concentration on his family.

2515
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:09,210
Check this out and his extended family
because he created [inaudible] on gas.

2516
01:56:09,390 --> 01:56:13,710
But he puts in Zyklon A.
There's a smell that they attached to it

2517
01:56:13,711 --> 01:56:16,530
so that you were aware of when the gas
was present,

2518
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:18,990
so like if you were working with it,
if there was a leak,

2519
01:56:18,991 --> 01:56:20,160
it was a very obvious smell.

2520
01:56:20,370 --> 01:56:25,370
The Nazis took cycle on a and remove
that smell and turned to design clumpy,

2521
01:56:25,801 --> 01:56:29,490
which they used to spray the.
The people in the concentration camp.

2522
01:56:30,410 --> 01:56:34,590
Jews and his family got caught.
Some of his extended family was killed

2523
01:56:34,591 --> 01:56:37,740
with the very gas that he created.
Oh my God.

2524
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:38,970
Yeah.
And then he died.

2525
01:56:38,971 --> 01:56:41,910
He was exiled from Germany.
The whole thing was horrible.

2526
01:56:42,030 --> 01:56:45,090
His.
He was a Jew and so he tried to stand up

2527
01:56:45,091 --> 01:56:48,630
for Jews as scientists and as people.
And it was like slowly getting pushed

2528
01:56:48,631 --> 01:56:51,000
out of the Nazis were taking control.
Oh my God.

2529
01:56:51,001 --> 01:56:53,360
And then he wanted to believe in the
country and he attack.

2530
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:54,473
He had,
he had,

2531
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:56,930
he had terrible health.
Right.

2532
01:56:56,970 --> 01:56:59,700
And he died like,
I think he was going to Switzerland for

2533
01:56:59,701 --> 01:57:02,070
treatment and he wound up dying.
She's little,

2534
01:57:02,150 --> 01:57:04,470
his wife killed herself.
Wife shot himself,

2535
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:07,590
shot herself in the chest in a,
in,

2536
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:08,473
in front of.

2537
01:57:08,590 --> 01:57:11,490
Well,
it was him and his son and he left his

2538
01:57:11,491 --> 01:57:15,480
13 year old son with his dead wife and
then went back to war.

2539
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:17,010
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2540
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,890
She did it because.
Because he was killing people with gas.

2541
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:22,010
Is Gas was used.
She was.

2542
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:25,020
She was apparently gravely.
She was a scientist as well.

2543
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:27,690
Oh my.
She was gravely upset at the direction

2544
01:57:27,691 --> 01:57:31,530
that his science had taken that he was.
He was involved in this new thing.

2545
01:57:31,531 --> 01:57:34,230
I mean,
imagine you're the architect of this new

2546
01:57:34,231 --> 01:57:37,400
method of killing mass.
Extermination.

2547
01:57:37,410 --> 01:57:39,540
But then here's the.
Here's the other problem with that.

2548
01:57:39,550 --> 01:57:41,760
That's a crazy story.
It's crazy,

2549
01:57:41,780 --> 01:57:43,680
but what does.
What does that mean?

2550
01:57:43,681 --> 01:57:46,140
Like he's too good at killing people.
Oh,

2551
01:57:46,141 --> 01:57:50,370
we don't believe in killing people by
having them choked to death on the fluid

2552
01:57:50,371 --> 01:57:52,290
in their lungs is built up because of
poison.

2553
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,450
We would rather you take a bullet to the
Dick,

2554
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:59,750
like
what the fuck you were in war cannons

2555
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:00,570
and people.

2556
01:58:00,570 --> 01:58:05,570
They have these gigantic 50 millimeter
guns blowing people to smithereens and

2557
01:58:06,211 --> 01:58:08,280
that's okay,
but the gas is not okay.

2558
01:58:08,281 --> 01:58:11,010
Like we have rules where we're supposed
to kill,

2559
01:58:11,011 --> 01:58:13,470
kill the right way.
What the fuck?

2560
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:18,030
We're dropping nuclear bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

2561
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:20,730
Nuclear bombs that are completely
indiscriminate.

2562
01:58:20,731 --> 01:58:23,700
Wipe out entire cities.
Killed hundreds of thousands of people

2563
01:58:23,701 --> 01:58:25,710
in one blast.
That's okay,

2564
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:27,120
but that's clean.
That gas,

2565
01:58:27,610 --> 01:58:31,410
that gas is dirty.
You're an asshole to use the gas bro.

2566
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,260
Terrible stories.
We're.

2567
01:58:34,261 --> 01:58:36,430
It's a very terrible store.
It's weird store.

2568
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:40,020
So then he created,
so they took that and that's where

2569
01:58:40,021 --> 01:58:42,250
fertilizer came from.
You know where he went wrong.

2570
01:58:42,610 --> 01:58:47,440
He was trying to fund the war effort by
extracting gold from the ocean who is

2571
01:58:47,441 --> 01:58:51,430
convinced that just like his hobby or
method of extracting nitrogen from the

2572
01:58:51,431 --> 01:58:53,230
air,
he was going to be able to because the

2573
01:58:53,231 --> 01:58:56,140
ocean has gold in.
It was very small amounts of gold,

2574
01:58:56,141 --> 01:58:58,540
but he felt like if you could get it all
together,

2575
01:58:58,690 --> 01:59:02,710
it would be a large amount and he could
extract that gold from the ocean and

2576
01:59:02,711 --> 01:59:07,420
then use it to fund the war effort.
Sounds like you and I have a treasure

2577
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:12,780
to do once the bread shows,
but gold show,

2578
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:16,880
tom and joe,
scuba gear on bags.

2579
01:59:18,490 --> 01:59:21,550
Harbor Gold process is unique for
several reasons.

2580
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:25,660
It effectively is capable of yielding
extraction efficiencies with complex

2581
01:59:25,730 --> 01:59:30,520
oars in the high 90 percent range with
gold purity in the 99 percent range.

2582
01:59:30,790 --> 01:59:34,780
Preprocessing prior to process.
We carefully analyze the or for the

2583
01:59:34,781 --> 01:59:38,140
content of other minerals and or
constituents.

2584
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:41,170
So is this,
is this something that they actually

2585
01:59:41,171 --> 01:59:42,070
use?
See,

2586
01:59:42,370 --> 01:59:45,280
maybe they use it now.
They use it for other things that didn't

2587
01:59:45,281 --> 01:59:47,950
go to the society and I eliminated
Sinai.

2588
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:50,500
He was a genius,
but I don't.

2589
01:59:50,830 --> 01:59:53,320
The gold thing didn't pan out.
Wink,

2590
01:59:53,321 --> 01:59:54,041
wink,
nudge,

2591
01:59:54,041 --> 01:59:56,260
nudge,
no pun intended.

2592
01:59:56,810 --> 01:59:58,200
Get it.
Pan for gold.

2593
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:04,270
It didn't work,
but he apparently worked on that for

2594
02:00:04,271 --> 02:00:06,850
years and years and it just never came
to fruition.

2595
02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:10,000
Well that was his failure,
but as big success,

2596
02:00:10,170 --> 02:00:13,180
he felt like he was going to recreate
the nitrogen method with the gold

2597
02:00:13,181 --> 02:00:15,670
method.
Like figure it out another way to just

2598
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:18,190
be a hero for Germany.
Amazing.

2599
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:20,110
An amazing story.
Crazy.

2600
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:23,740
What's so now we're left with corn being
fed to cows,

2601
02:00:25,790 --> 02:00:29,440
has corn in
it is awful.

2602
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:33,160
But here's the thing is I read about
that stuff and uh,

2603
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:35,150
you know,
you read about this,

2604
02:00:35,230 --> 02:00:38,740
it's such an unnatural thing that we're
doing to the cattle to feed them this

2605
02:00:38,741 --> 02:00:41,710
corn and dualism.
But are we at a point where there's just

2606
02:00:41,711 --> 02:00:45,970
so many people on the planet that this
is the only way you can do it?

2607
02:00:45,971 --> 02:00:48,640
Or is there other ways to do it?
Maybe like a,

2608
02:00:48,641 --> 02:00:49,474
I'm gonna read you.

2609
02:00:49,490 --> 02:00:53,950
Some people are always complaining about
the methane gas that's produced by cows

2610
02:00:53,951 --> 02:00:56,690
and that was one of the big arguments
that people would say,

2611
02:00:56,691 --> 02:01:01,510
well one of the reasons why people
should not eat cows is because if you do

2612
02:01:01,511 --> 02:01:03,100
eat cows,
like say if you're on like that

2613
02:01:03,101 --> 02:01:06,100
carnivore diet and you're.
All you eat is cows.

2614
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:09,610
It has a massive negative contribution
to the environment.

2615
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:14,470
But Sean Baker sent me this scientific
overview and it says in the

2616
02:01:14,471 --> 02:01:18,700
environmental side of the United States,
the entirety of all plants and animal

2617
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:22,320
agriculture contributes to nine percent
of the total unit.

2618
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:26,350
US greenhouse gas emissions,
animal agriculture makes up about four

2619
02:01:26,351 --> 02:01:28,530
percent and cattle,
uh,

2620
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:33,540
specifically about one point nine
percent based on the latest EPA data.

2621
02:01:35,890 --> 02:01:39,710
If every single person in the United
States gives up eating meat and went

2622
02:01:39,711 --> 02:01:40,220
vegan

2623
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:42,980
end,
every single animal were to magically

2624
02:01:42,981 --> 02:01:45,950
disappear.
The overall worldwide effect on

2625
02:01:45,951 --> 02:01:50,951
greenhouse gas emissions would be about
less than one percent difference.

2626
02:01:51,650 --> 02:01:55,220
But as I spoke with a professor,
frank,

2627
02:01:55,640 --> 02:02:00,640
I say this guy's name mid low her from a
UC Davis,

2628
02:02:02,020 --> 02:02:04,370
uh,
one of the world's leading authorities

2629
02:02:04,371 --> 02:02:06,770
on greenhouse gases and animal
agriculture.

2630
02:02:06,830 --> 02:02:08,990
And said,
putting the blame on meat is a

2631
02:02:08,991 --> 02:02:12,230
disservice.
And it distracts from the real issue of

2632
02:02:12,231 --> 02:02:15,980
our tremendous fossil fuel utilization.
Interesting.

2633
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:18,750
Interesting.
But there's a lot that goes.

2634
02:02:18,751 --> 02:02:20,820
It's not just the gas that's coming off
of,

2635
02:02:20,910 --> 02:02:22,710
right?
It's where this is the methane,

2636
02:02:22,850 --> 02:02:24,030
the question,
right?

2637
02:02:24,090 --> 02:02:24,661
You know,
the,

2638
02:02:24,661 --> 02:02:25,121
the,
the,

2639
02:02:25,121 --> 02:02:30,121
the real concern that keeps coming up.
Like I had this lady and she's on this

2640
02:02:31,921 --> 02:02:34,530
carnivore diet,
which it seems to me that she's got.

2641
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:38,340
She had some matches,
massive autoimmune issues like had her

2642
02:02:38,670 --> 02:02:43,170
hip replaced and she was 17 and her
ankle replaced like massive arthritis

2643
02:02:43,171 --> 02:02:46,710
issues and she's on this diet of all
meat and several other people on this

2644
02:02:46,711 --> 02:02:48,450
diet as well.
They're calling it the carnivore diet

2645
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:50,640
and experiencing,
at least for the short term,

2646
02:02:50,641 --> 02:02:52,260
they're experiencing these tremendous
benefits.

2647
02:02:52,770 --> 02:02:56,520
So the critics are saying you are
contributing to greenhouse gases and

2648
02:02:56,521 --> 02:02:58,620
methane.
You're ruining the environment by eating

2649
02:02:58,621 --> 02:02:59,970
beef.
And he's saying,

2650
02:02:59,971 --> 02:03:01,200
well,
not really.

2651
02:03:01,690 --> 02:03:02,490
The the,
the,

2652
02:03:02,490 --> 02:03:06,300
the amount is very small in comparison
to all the other issues.

2653
02:03:06,301 --> 02:03:08,940
It's less than one percent of the
greenhouse gases,

2654
02:03:09,030 --> 02:03:12,930
but then they also hear that on that
argument that it's really oil that is

2655
02:03:12,931 --> 02:03:14,640
being used,
right?

2656
02:03:14,641 --> 02:03:15,690
It's,
it's still a,

2657
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:20,280
a carbon based thing to try to transport
it,

2658
02:03:20,330 --> 02:03:23,880
to support the food from the farming all
the way through the transporting to

2659
02:03:24,490 --> 02:03:27,390
getting rid of the waste to doing all of
it that there's for now,

2660
02:03:27,391 --> 02:03:29,850
but Tesla's making semis,
Tesla's,

2661
02:03:30,380 --> 02:03:32,630
they're constructing these gigantic.
Super Cool.

2662
02:03:32,631 --> 02:03:34,310
Look and fucking Tron,
semis,

2663
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:39,960
they're going to operate entirely on
batteries and once that happens you have

2664
02:03:40,041 --> 02:03:44,930
automated battery controlled trucks.
Then I think the real problem is going

2665
02:03:44,931 --> 02:03:48,140
to be people out of jobs.
That's going to be a giant crisis.

2666
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:49,700
Even robots.
Yeah.

2667
02:03:49,790 --> 02:03:53,480
Once,
especially for drivers apparently for

2668
02:03:53,481 --> 02:03:57,110
men in particular,
some massive number in the millions of

2669
02:03:57,330 --> 02:04:00,590
people in this country rely on driving
for a living.

2670
02:04:00,610 --> 02:04:03,060
Like that's a big part of their job,
their drivers.

2671
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:04,360
Um,
it's a,

2672
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:06,320
it's a giant industry.
Well,

2673
02:04:06,321 --> 02:04:10,130
they say that's happening now across all
industries that are trying to figure

2674
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:10,510
out.
Yeah,

2675
02:04:10,510 --> 02:04:13,280
the automation is putting so many people
out of work.

2676
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:14,930
Yeah.
I'm going to talk to Bernie Sanders

2677
02:04:14,931 --> 02:04:16,080
about that.
You who?

2678
02:04:16,090 --> 02:04:17,320
Yeah,
no way.

2679
02:04:17,321 --> 02:04:18,840
Yeah.
Me and Bernie been emailing each other.

2680
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:21,080
Really burning.
That'd be a great one.

2681
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:22,370
John.
Joe,

2682
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,470
Joe.
I'd like to talk to that guy.

2683
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:30,240
I also want to talk to other people that
are proponents of universal basic income

2684
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:35,100
and Ilan has said that he thinks that
this is gonna be a real factor in the

2685
02:04:35,101 --> 02:04:36,660
future.
Universal basic income.

2686
02:04:36,661 --> 02:04:38,130
So this is a truck that we're looking

2687
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:40,080
at right now in a video and what it
looks like.

2688
02:04:40,081 --> 02:04:42,750
A rolling.
Is anyone in that apple store from

2689
02:04:42,820 --> 02:04:45,090
yesterday in Iowa?
They showed it off.

2690
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:47,520
That's crazy.
Twenty six cameras on board.

2691
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,560
That's so dope.
Where's the batteries?

2692
02:04:50,810 --> 02:04:52,920
Is that on the bottom?
Is the bottom of the batteries?

2693
02:04:52,950 --> 02:04:54,670
Is that driving itself?
I don't know.

2694
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:57,090
It was there.
Someone driving that know the trailer is

2695
02:04:57,091 --> 02:05:01,120
all batteries
strapped packages.

2696
02:05:01,950 --> 02:05:04,320
Thing is the price.
The price is supposed to be around

2697
02:05:04,321 --> 02:05:06,750
$200,000 for one of those.
Dude,

2698
02:05:06,810 --> 02:05:09,340
this is what we do.
We buy one of those bitches and we turn

2699
02:05:09,341 --> 02:05:13,560
it into a roving podcast studio.
Drive us across the country.

2700
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:16,230
That would be the coolest.
We talk shit in the back.

2701
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,150
Wait,
it's driving on its own or there is a

2702
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:20,640
human driving it.
That one had a human driving it.

2703
02:05:20,641 --> 02:05:22,440
I.
I don't believe these are in production

2704
02:05:22,441 --> 02:05:24,690
yet.
So it's chasing a prototype.

2705
02:05:24,730 --> 02:05:29,730
That dork chasing,
trying to get himself

2706
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:35,790
and he's running.
He's like,

2707
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:37,410
oh,
I can run to.

2708
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:42,240
That is the coolest.
I had a gig up in.

2709
02:05:42,241 --> 02:05:46,110
I'm a last minute gig in Yosemite.
It was a casino up there,

2710
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:48,510
uh,
to open for smokey Robinson.

2711
02:05:48,570 --> 02:05:50,230
Well,
what was that like?

2712
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:52,270
It was the coolest you meet him.
Uh,

2713
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:53,760
I did meet him.
I met him once before.

2714
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:56,270
It was actually a cool story about,
about meeting him.

2715
02:05:56,271 --> 02:06:00,660
But uh,
I was going to take the tesla up and ran

2716
02:06:00,670 --> 02:06:01,590
out.
I was like,

2717
02:06:01,591 --> 02:06:03,210
yeah.
Like I was trying to plot,

2718
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:03,630
like,
do,

2719
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:06,810
will I be able to do it?
Get rid of that piece of no problem,

2720
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:08,200
no problem.
Fuck,

2721
02:06:08,450 --> 02:06:11,240
they're everywhere now.
Supercharger near Fresno.

2722
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:14,340
Just playing out eight hours in advance.
You could pull off for eight hours and

2723
02:06:14,341 --> 02:06:18,750
let you shit charge up factors in that.
You're only going to be 20 minutes of

2724
02:06:18,751 --> 02:06:21,140
charge or,
or 30 minutes of chart here.

2725
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:23,010
I'm telling you,
I'm out of here.

2726
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:26,270
You do stop in for 20 minutes at a time.
Yeah.

2727
02:06:26,271 --> 02:06:29,160
Well if you stop and pee and get a
coffee and read a book,

2728
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:33,810
take a shit,
go over your twitter feed cars out there

2729
02:06:33,811 --> 02:06:36,120
charging.
It was great.

2730
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:38,130
The goddamn car,
like a man who was so great.

2731
02:06:38,131 --> 02:06:42,090
Mustang something with some rumble too.
It was such a nice drive.

2732
02:06:42,450 --> 02:06:43,980
Don't you have a midlife crisis or
something?

2733
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:48,930
Going through the.
The prairie of Yosemite.

2734
02:06:48,931 --> 02:06:51,510
What if your bread sunrise bread showed
takes off?

2735
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:55,950
Get yourself a corvette.
I laugh and you never drive a corvette

2736
02:06:56,220 --> 02:06:58,130
if you had to drive.
It's so funny.

2737
02:06:58,650 --> 02:07:03,650
That's such a
life dream Dude.

2738
02:07:03,900 --> 02:07:05,850
Tony got a corvette.
Did he really?

2739
02:07:05,851 --> 02:07:06,810
Yeah.
He calls himself.

2740
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:09,720
He says he has corvette confidence.
When I texted him,

2741
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:12,150
I texted him.
Hashtag corvette confidence.

2742
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:16,830
When you drive a car,
fun like,

2743
02:07:17,020 --> 02:07:18,240
dude,
I drive it to work.

2744
02:07:18,241 --> 02:07:21,360
It's a game changer.
I'm driving to the comedy store.

2745
02:07:21,361 --> 02:07:23,370
I get fired up.
Fast.

2746
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:25,740
Rumbled healed.
Especially to the ice house because it's

2747
02:07:25,741 --> 02:07:27,330
further away.
I get that.

2748
02:07:29,650 --> 02:07:32,940
There is some.
I have a vw bug that's just shut your

2749
02:07:32,941 --> 02:07:36,700
mouth.
Don't ever new telling you.

2750
02:07:36,701 --> 02:07:40,840
Just having a fucking corvette.
You sort of just having the engine and

2751
02:07:40,841 --> 02:07:43,870
you're shifting and the smell of gas.
It does something to you for sure.

2752
02:07:43,871 --> 02:07:45,310
I love new bugs.
I'm just kidding.

2753
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:47,950
They're very mechanical,
but do you have an old one?

2754
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:49,620
60 seven.
Oh,

2755
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:51,280
those are the real ones.
That's beautiful.

2756
02:07:51,310 --> 02:07:52,580
Little sewing machine.
The bag.

2757
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:56,380
It's fun.
They're so light too.

2758
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:58,750
Yeah.
You know what they've done with those?

2759
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:02,850
They've taken those old vw bug and put
an old porsche engine in the back.

2760
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:05,470
Now there's a lot of people doing that
with the buses too.

2761
02:08:05,530 --> 02:08:08,320
Yeah,
so they'd put like 170 horsepower old

2762
02:08:08,321 --> 02:08:10,210
porsche engine,
which doesn't seem like a lot.

2763
02:08:10,510 --> 02:08:11,830
One hundred 70 horsepower.
It's not a lot,

2764
02:08:11,831 --> 02:08:13,440
but the car weighs nothing.
Yeah,

2765
02:08:13,550 --> 02:08:14,620
more than that.
Yeah.

2766
02:08:14,640 --> 02:08:17,650
With the gas tank in the front of your
car and you get those little tiny skinny

2767
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:18,840
tires on it.
Tuesday,

2768
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:21,430
stand out all over the place.
I think the beauty of it is that you

2769
02:08:21,431 --> 02:08:23,950
have the original engine and you just
kind of puttering along,

2770
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:26,340
but everyone gets annoyed.
It's like a,

2771
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:29,950
like a slow clown car.
People cut you off just to get around.

2772
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:32,770
You just don't even want to look at you
and not in this day and age.

2773
02:08:32,771 --> 02:08:34,810
I mean you think about how fast teslas
are.

2774
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:37,880
Oh my God.
Those things are unbelievably fast.

2775
02:08:37,900 --> 02:08:38,650
It's another

2776
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:39,483
station.
It's.

2777
02:08:39,570 --> 02:08:42,330
It's definitely satisfying.
It's not that gas law,

2778
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:45,390
but there's a.
This is telling you the sunrise was

2779
02:08:45,391 --> 02:08:48,840
coming up and I'm just silent.
No other cars around.

2780
02:08:48,841 --> 02:08:50,130
Just going through this prairie

2781
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:51,450
going to beach,
smokey Robinson.

2782
02:08:51,451 --> 02:08:54,240
Let me stop for an hour and a half to
get some electricity.

2783
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:55,830
Oh,
I can drive for two hours now.

2784
02:08:55,860 --> 02:08:59,040
Pull over.
How much time do you have to plan out

2785
02:08:59,041 --> 02:09:02,850
just for charging extra five hours.
I spent a good day at trying to figure

2786
02:09:02,851 --> 02:09:03,684
out my ribs.

2787
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:06,740
No,
but here's the rock star move.

2788
02:09:07,270 --> 02:09:10,220
Uh,
I had met smokey once before in New

2789
02:09:10,220 --> 02:09:12,500
York.
We did a charity for kids in the arts,

2790
02:09:14,090 --> 02:09:15,770
kid rock,
kids rock or something,

2791
02:09:16,170 --> 02:09:17,810
a kids who?
Rutgers School of rock,

2792
02:09:17,811 --> 02:09:19,280
something like that.
Anyway,

2793
02:09:19,281 --> 02:09:21,500
I'd met him before,
so I was excited to take the GIG and I

2794
02:09:21,501 --> 02:09:24,560
figured I'll meet smokey Robinson.
It's an outdoor arena,

2795
02:09:24,590 --> 02:09:25,910
you know,
it's an outdoor event.

2796
02:09:26,270 --> 02:09:29,030
And uh,
they just used me to burn time while the

2797
02:09:29,031 --> 02:09:31,430
sun went down and then he could come out
at nighttime.

2798
02:09:32,050 --> 02:09:35,390
And uh,
so I'm sitting there with a guy that I'm

2799
02:09:35,391 --> 02:09:38,780
just talking to and smoky comes out of
our dressing rooms or trailers because

2800
02:09:38,781 --> 02:09:42,460
it's outside and this gravel driveway
and stuff and smoke.

2801
02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:45,140
He comes out,
he's like 78 now.

2802
02:09:45,141 --> 02:09:47,570
He's in all red,
red jumpsuit,

2803
02:09:47,810 --> 02:09:49,190
red,
cool jacket,

2804
02:09:49,250 --> 02:09:52,280
red leather boots.
And he comes out and I'm like,

2805
02:09:52,290 --> 02:09:56,120
all right,
I'll get to say hi to smokey suv door

2806
02:09:56,121 --> 02:09:59,510
opens.
He goes right into the SUV and he drives

2807
02:09:59,511 --> 02:10:03,920
literally 20 feet so.
And drops them off at the stage so he

2808
02:10:03,921 --> 02:10:06,760
could go right up onto the stage.
He didn't even want to get his.

2809
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:10,010
He didn't want to get his boots dirty on
the gravel walkway.

2810
02:10:10,011 --> 02:10:10,970
Yeah.
So they.

2811
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:13,310
Yeah.
So they literally put them in this suv.

2812
02:10:13,311 --> 02:10:15,890
I'm telling you from here to the end of
your studio.

2813
02:10:16,130 --> 02:10:18,170
They just dropped him off and he went
right up on stage.

2814
02:10:18,171 --> 02:10:20,770
And like that,
that smokey that is okay.

2815
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:23,520
That is a kick ass rockstar move.
That's,

2816
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:25,030
that's.
If you don't want to keep your,

2817
02:10:25,090 --> 02:10:27,100
you know,
you won't want to get your boots dirty.

2818
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:28,630
It's good move.
Yeah.

2819
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:30,080
Comedians don't think that way.
No.

2820
02:10:30,130 --> 02:10:31,900
I'm walking to my dress shoes across the
thing.

2821
02:10:32,790 --> 02:10:36,140
Just get them all dirty and fucked up.
I feel like one of the people that way.

2822
02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:36,831
Yeah.
Right.

2823
02:10:36,831 --> 02:10:39,150
Exactly.
We're not rockstars rockstars.

2824
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:40,100
A different thing,
man.

2825
02:10:40,101 --> 02:10:41,780
Totally.
Totally.

2826
02:10:41,781 --> 02:10:44,570
Especially that.
That kind of smooth skin has been a rock

2827
02:10:44,571 --> 02:10:48,500
star for a long time forever.
My parents were listening to them when

2828
02:10:48,501 --> 02:10:49,970
they were teenagers,
you know?

2829
02:10:50,410 --> 02:10:53,240
I mean,
that's a long time that he's been still

2830
02:10:53,241 --> 02:10:55,370
as the voice still.
Is this cool moves?

2831
02:10:55,650 --> 02:10:57,980
Is he healthy?
You can move.

2832
02:10:57,981 --> 02:10:58,820
Well,
totally.

2833
02:10:58,910 --> 02:11:00,860
Wow.
She's got this really cool.

2834
02:11:00,861 --> 02:11:03,020
Like does he exercise?
Did you talk to him?

2835
02:11:03,021 --> 02:11:06,080
I didn't know.
How would I talk to someone that's that

2836
02:11:06,081 --> 02:11:07,640
old that's been around for that long.

2837
02:11:07,740 --> 02:11:10,400
See what the Jagger.
Apparently it's just an exercise

2838
02:11:10,401 --> 02:11:11,260
fanatic.
Yeah,

2839
02:11:11,270 --> 02:11:13,430
he's.
That's what I heard you exercise twice a

2840
02:11:13,431 --> 02:11:14,290
day.
Yeah.

2841
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:15,890
And realize was like this.
The only way,

2842
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:17,990
the only way you can keep this up,
amazing.

2843
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:19,400
Just,
I mean he's in his seventies.

2844
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:22,290
The only way his body's going to
maintain health because he's got to

2845
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:25,960
consistently exercise so funny that he's
next to Keith.

2846
02:11:27,710 --> 02:11:29,990
The total opposite way to go.
The miracles.

2847
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:32,310
Look at them smoking.
Wow.

2848
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:34,670
Nineteen 65.
Sixty five.

2849
02:11:34,671 --> 02:11:38,420
That picture's already a star.
That's amazing.

2850
02:11:38,700 --> 02:11:39,980
God,
what does he look like today,

2851
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:43,430
but very similar.
Smokey Robinson in 2018.

2852
02:11:43,670 --> 02:11:44,810
Is that him?
Well,

2853
02:11:44,811 --> 02:11:47,330
that's Tony Bennett and lady Gaga,
so that's probably serious.

2854
02:11:47,331 --> 02:11:48,770
Yeah.
Let's go to that picture.

2855
02:11:48,980 --> 02:11:51,200
Make that picture bigger.
It looks pretty.

2856
02:11:51,201 --> 02:11:52,210
God damn good.
What's happening?

2857
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:53,280
Good.
Lady Gaga.

2858
02:11:53,281 --> 02:11:54,830
Look Smoking.
Yeah.

2859
02:11:56,150 --> 02:11:59,000
She looks like she looks like she's
going to forget how hot she is.

2860
02:11:59,780 --> 02:12:02,840
She's in a star is born.
Somebody tell me she me.

2861
02:12:02,841 --> 02:12:04,940
She wasn't hot and like picture out of
your mind.

2862
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:08,930
You tell them you wouldn't smash.
You ever see those videos of her when

2863
02:12:08,931 --> 02:12:11,120
she was like an Nyu or something like
doing?

2864
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:13,910
Just starting out.
She's super talented.

2865
02:12:14,050 --> 02:12:15,950
Totally.
In a weird way,

2866
02:12:15,980 --> 02:12:16,791
right?
Yeah.

2867
02:12:16,791 --> 02:12:18,170
Well,
very her own way,

2868
02:12:18,350 --> 02:12:19,880
you know?
Yeah.

2869
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,280
She's amazing.
A harmful.

2870
02:12:22,281 --> 02:12:23,680
Smokey,
smokey.

2871
02:12:24,260 --> 02:12:26,420
Yeah.
We don't have any comics that are that

2872
02:12:26,421 --> 02:12:29,960
old right now that are like,
like once.

2873
02:12:30,110 --> 02:12:31,640
Yeah,
once George Carlin died.

2874
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:35,810
Carla was like our last great touring
stand up.

2875
02:12:36,110 --> 02:12:39,380
That was of that age from the sixties.
Yeah.

2876
02:12:39,620 --> 02:12:41,450
No one else is like that.
That's still around.

2877
02:12:41,510 --> 02:12:44,240
No.
Joan rivers gone.

2878
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:45,800
Rickles gun though.
Oh,

2879
02:12:45,830 --> 02:12:49,130
you know who is so um,
Bob Newhart.

2880
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:54,200
Bob newhart still doing gigs.
Did you take a long time off and start

2881
02:12:54,201 --> 02:12:55,260
doing them again or something now?

2882
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:57,440
We just would always kinda quietly do
it.

2883
02:12:57,530 --> 02:12:59,000
Really?
No kidding.

2884
02:12:59,070 --> 02:13:00,590
You've seen him?
I've never seen him.

2885
02:13:00,620 --> 02:13:03,320
Now you actually,
he was on Conan the other night and I

2886
02:13:03,321 --> 02:13:05,690
was going to try and get tickets to see
him in the palm desert.

2887
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:10,040
Burl and I were planning on going to see
cosby before the scandal broke.

2888
02:13:10,070 --> 02:13:10,881
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2889
02:13:10,881 --> 02:13:11,511
We,
you know,

2890
02:13:11,511 --> 02:13:13,190
because we had,
we were talking to him one night at the

2891
02:13:13,191 --> 02:13:16,340
store and we'd always heard like how
good he is.

2892
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:17,940
Got to go see him.
You got to go see.

2893
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:19,490
I'm like,
Chris Rock had said,

2894
02:13:19,491 --> 02:13:20,780
dude,
he fucking killed.

2895
02:13:20,781 --> 02:13:23,930
He killed for two hours.
He went on stage with no opening act.

2896
02:13:24,250 --> 02:13:27,920
He just walks out there and he starts
talking and she starts crushing and he

2897
02:13:27,921 --> 02:13:30,860
goes,
I was blown away and Chris Rock was

2898
02:13:30,861 --> 02:13:31,630
saying this.
He goes,

2899
02:13:31,630 --> 02:13:32,040
well,
I went

2900
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:32,611
to see him.
I was like,

2901
02:13:32,611 --> 02:13:33,990
God damn man,
I'm an amateur.

2902
02:13:34,220 --> 02:13:36,210
And I was like,
wow.

2903
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:36,850
And it was like,
oh,

2904
02:13:36,850 --> 02:13:39,390
we should go.
So burt and I were planning and

2905
02:13:39,391 --> 02:13:43,050
something came out we had to cancel.
And then right after that,

2906
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:45,470
something fucking,
something big came up

2907
02:13:47,190 --> 02:13:47,910
down there.
We're like,

2908
02:13:47,910 --> 02:13:49,920
Oh God,
that's terrible.

2909
02:13:49,921 --> 02:13:51,740
I saw som though.
Bill went and song.

2910
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:53,460
I saw him.
I saw him.

2911
02:13:53,461 --> 02:13:57,180
Uh,
my wife was pregnant with our first baby

2912
02:13:57,570 --> 02:14:00,390
and we had,
I was doing Conan and then I was going

2913
02:14:00,391 --> 02:14:02,850
to have two weeks off before the baby
was born.

2914
02:14:02,851 --> 02:14:06,630
That was gonna be the last Gig I did.
We're going to take two weeks off and

2915
02:14:06,631 --> 02:14:09,690
just hang out.
Before this new baby came,

2916
02:14:09,691 --> 02:14:13,140
we were living in New York and we went
to see cosby.

2917
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:15,990
Seinfeld took us to see cosby at
Carnegie Hall.

2918
02:14:16,120 --> 02:14:17,320
Wow.

2919
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:22,400
And we laughed for two hours.
It was a masterclass that he was so

2920
02:14:23,071 --> 02:14:24,600
good,
so easy,

2921
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:28,830
and we just laughed forever and uh,
went home and her water broke.

2922
02:14:29,670 --> 02:14:30,451
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

2923
02:14:30,451 --> 02:14:33,540
We always felt like that.
All that laughing kind of made her water

2924
02:14:33,541 --> 02:14:35,280
break,
but it was a,

2925
02:14:35,310 --> 02:14:38,310
it was definitely impressive.
Impressive.

2926
02:14:38,311 --> 02:14:39,600
You know,
it was impressive about it.

2927
02:14:40,860 --> 02:14:43,710
He would tell these stories and build
the,

2928
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:48,600
build it without laughs.
There would be like very few labs for

2929
02:14:48,601 --> 02:14:51,510
like 10 minutes as he's telling the
story.

2930
02:14:51,810 --> 02:14:55,530
And you didn't realize even as a comic
that he was building this tension.

2931
02:14:55,531 --> 02:15:00,531
So when the laugh did come,
it was bigger than any laugh you've ever

2932
02:15:01,591 --> 02:15:03,510
heard.
I mean he would just,

2933
02:15:03,570 --> 02:15:07,770
it was the building of it.
He's the confidence to not feel like he

2934
02:15:07,771 --> 02:15:10,080
had to go from laugh to laugh,
to laugh every 30 seconds.

2935
02:15:10,230 --> 02:15:11,160
He would just let it build

2936
02:15:11,410 --> 02:15:15,130
bill and then it would ba boom.
It would explode.

2937
02:15:15,140 --> 02:15:17,720
I wonder if there's recordings of him
later in life,

2938
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:21,140
like before the scandal broke,
like when he was in his seventies

2939
02:15:21,410 --> 02:15:24,590
before.
Because I think now it would be

2940
02:15:24,591 --> 02:15:26,110
impossible.
Like if you go to see him,

2941
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,560
don't.
I know he's not performing now,

2942
02:15:27,561 --> 02:15:29,390
but if you was,
it would be impossible.

2943
02:15:29,450 --> 02:15:34,280
I wouldn't want to go.
It's like so gross and so tainted and so

2944
02:15:34,700 --> 02:15:36,920
it's a shame.
It's like you would have crazy.

2945
02:15:37,130 --> 02:15:41,810
You'd have to watch him almost like a
scientist and observe him before.

2946
02:15:42,410 --> 02:15:45,020
I wonder if it would think about it too.
Like now if you watch,

2947
02:15:45,050 --> 02:15:49,040
even if you want you to recording,
you'd be watching it thinking I wonder

2948
02:15:49,041 --> 02:15:51,440
if he right now in the back of his mind,
he's like,

2949
02:15:51,470 --> 02:15:53,810
Holy Shit,
I'm a rapist and they don't know.

2950
02:15:54,140 --> 02:15:54,973
I know.

2951
02:15:55,150 --> 02:15:57,280
I haven't looked at anything that he's
done since then.

2952
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,610
I mean that was such a.

2953
02:16:02,020 --> 02:16:05,920
He was trying to make a public relations
come back.

2954
02:16:06,010 --> 02:16:11,010
Last year he did a,
if you find a find a video of bill cosby

2955
02:16:11,351 --> 02:16:16,351
holding court in a barbershop in Philly.
He was at a barbershop and Philly and

2956
02:16:16,601 --> 02:16:20,560
they were talking about jazz musicians
and like he was like giving them,

2957
02:16:21,250 --> 02:16:23,930
giving them trivia questions.
He's barbershop,

2958
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:27,310
jazz musicians,
and I was reading the comments and the

2959
02:16:27,311 --> 02:16:28,690
comments are like,
we love you,

2960
02:16:28,691 --> 02:16:30,460
bill,
believe you bill.

2961
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:34,030
You know those accusers are assholes,
like,

2962
02:16:34,470 --> 02:16:35,920
look at this.
Give me some volume

2963
02:16:36,030 --> 02:16:41,030
raises on base,
on base making and I'm making up these

2964
02:16:43,490 --> 02:16:48,490
because you don't have your glass.
He told me that I'll take a two hour

2965
02:16:48,841 --> 02:16:49,674
shot.
He

2966
02:16:50,980 --> 02:16:53,270
told me,
he said,

2967
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:54,810
this doctor got me.
I said,

2968
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:59,520
Dr. I take my shower.
I'm one of those people that wipe the

2969
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:01,590
shower now.
I don't want the water running on the

2970
02:17:01,591 --> 02:17:03,030
towel.
I don't want them to be able to do.

2971
02:17:03,031 --> 02:17:07,100
I want to be clean and dry when I get
out of that.

2972
02:17:07,490 --> 02:17:12,490
Obviously maybe with me properly,
but obviously you live alone

2973
02:17:15,270 --> 02:17:19,170
so you have to clean up as my father
would say,

2974
02:17:19,470 --> 02:17:23,160
behind your own mess.
Even when I was married,

2975
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:25,510
I did the same thing.
Everybody in the house after a certain

2976
02:17:25,511 --> 02:17:27,210
age,
he looks really old independently.

2977
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:32,240
Take care of
unanimous when they left,

2978
02:17:32,401 --> 02:17:34,080
but they was independently.
They can stand on.

2979
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:36,450
It's weird to watch him because this
life as well.

2980
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:39,480
He's wearing that hello friend.
He kept,

2981
02:17:39,810 --> 02:17:43,830
he would wear that on stage,
he would wear sweaters that say hello

2982
02:17:43,831 --> 02:17:46,710
friend.
He started saying that clothes dressing

2983
02:17:46,711 --> 02:17:50,270
up on stage was a crutch,
so sometimes he would come out with just

2984
02:17:50,271 --> 02:17:52,410
like his birkenstocks and just take them
off.

2985
02:17:52,411 --> 02:17:55,820
He just be in his socks.
He thought that being dressed up was

2986
02:17:55,870 --> 02:18:00,450
like putting on too much of a show that
you should rely purely on the spoken

2987
02:18:00,451 --> 02:18:01,920
word of it.
Well,

2988
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:06,290
I mean I don't buy that.
I certainly,

2989
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:09,990
I certainly don't.
I don't buy you telling other people how

2990
02:18:09,991 --> 02:18:11,040
they should do it.
Anything.

2991
02:18:11,130 --> 02:18:13,360
I mean there's,
there's a bunch of ways to do it.

2992
02:18:13,370 --> 02:18:15,540
Well,
of course he wants to be comfortable on

2993
02:18:15,541 --> 02:18:17,030
stage.
Where a hello friends?

2994
02:18:17,031 --> 02:18:18,300
Sweatshirt.
Well he's fine,

2995
02:18:18,330 --> 02:18:20,550
but he was big at telling people how
they're supposed to live.

2996
02:18:20,551 --> 02:18:21,240
Right?
I mean,

2997
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:22,190
well that was going up there.

2998
02:18:23,130 --> 02:18:24,930
That's so ironic about it because Eddie
Murphy,

2999
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:29,960
first of all would go on stage with
fucking leather jumpsuits on like bright

3000
02:18:30,241 --> 02:18:33,200
red jumpsuits unzipped down to the
naval.

3001
02:18:33,260 --> 02:18:35,400
Yeah.
And then cosby would attack him because

3002
02:18:35,401 --> 02:18:40,401
he dropped that bombs split me.
But meanwhile it's so gross.

3003
02:18:40,771 --> 02:18:42,300
So Gross,
so gross.

3004
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:43,740
Well hypocrites,
man,

3005
02:18:44,010 --> 02:18:46,740
I know.
Strange like that kind of a hypocrite,

3006
02:18:46,741 --> 02:18:50,190
like telling you how to live your life
while the rape and people and how crazy,

3007
02:18:50,191 --> 02:18:53,660
how many women had to come out before it
started to fall.

3008
02:18:54,630 --> 02:18:57,850
Started it all off.
Our Buddy Hannibal,

3009
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:00,870
Hannibal,
just did a show somewhere and talked

3010
02:19:00,871 --> 02:19:02,700
about it on stage and somebody recorded
it.

3011
02:19:03,090 --> 02:19:04,140
And then people like,
wait,

3012
02:19:04,350 --> 02:19:07,110
Bill cosby raped people,
right?

3013
02:19:07,140 --> 02:19:10,380
And like wildfire.
And it spreads through the culture.

3014
02:19:10,560 --> 02:19:13,410
But how crazy they like it didn't take
just one woman saying he raped,

3015
02:19:13,411 --> 02:19:15,540
right?
It had to be like 16.

3016
02:19:15,570 --> 02:19:16,980
Well,
he had settled a bunch of,

3017
02:19:17,010 --> 02:19:19,610
a bunch of cases settled.
Um,

3018
02:19:19,740 --> 02:19:22,320
close the.
Close the story.

3019
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:26,500
No sealed the records.
Nondisclosure 3 million.

3020
02:19:26,690 --> 02:19:27,231
Yeah,
yeah,

3021
02:19:27,231 --> 02:19:28,160
yeah.
And

3022
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:32,120
now he's suing one of the women who's
testify against them because she's

3023
02:19:32,121 --> 02:19:34,460
violating the hush payment.
Oh,

3024
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:36,800
really?
Dark.

3025
02:19:36,801 --> 02:19:41,801
So sick of everybody else's sex.
The hello friend is a nod to his son

3026
02:19:42,381 --> 02:19:45,890
that was murdered.
It's a memorial to him.

3027
02:19:46,090 --> 02:19:49,220
Oh yeah.
There was an article I just found from a

3028
02:19:49,221 --> 02:19:52,010
long time ago,
like 1993 that he made a jazz album

3029
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:54,890
dedicated to them called hello friend.
Okay.

3030
02:19:55,420 --> 02:19:57,500
Did they ever find who killed us on and
why?

3031
02:19:57,800 --> 02:20:00,050
Yeah,
I think they did it like he.

3032
02:20:00,051 --> 02:20:01,310
His car broke down,
right?

3033
02:20:01,370 --> 02:20:03,290
Yeah.
Like by the four or five or something

3034
02:20:03,710 --> 02:20:06,590
and he was like getting out to fix it
and someone killed them.

3035
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:10,460
Was it a.
was it just a random crime or was it a

3036
02:20:10,670 --> 02:20:11,990
robbery?
I think it was.

3037
02:20:11,991 --> 02:20:15,280
I think it was robbery,
attempted robbery attempt because did he

3038
02:20:15,290 --> 02:20:16,400
have a nice car or something?

3039
02:20:17,260 --> 02:20:20,090
He had a Mercedes.
So terrible.

3040
02:20:20,690 --> 02:20:25,190
What a tragedy in American tragedy.
He's an American tragedy it up across

3041
02:20:25,191 --> 02:20:29,630
the board to bottom.
He was so beloved and that's fat Albert

3042
02:20:29,631 --> 02:20:33,140
and the cosby show in this standup and
the strangest thing.

3043
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:35,360
Hearing that guy call him.
Dr Cosby.

3044
02:20:35,790 --> 02:20:37,520
Do you a doctor anymore?
Yeah,

3045
02:20:37,521 --> 02:20:40,190
they think they all took him.
They took that shit back everyone.

3046
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:42,650
Yeah.
Was an honorary doctorate,

3047
02:20:42,680 --> 02:20:43,760
right?
Yeah,

3048
02:20:43,790 --> 02:20:46,980
right from different schools.
A temple and

3049
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:51,830
nasty and honorary doctorate.
Would you call yourself Dr Papa?

3050
02:20:52,130 --> 02:20:56,000
Yeah.
Would you know I'm a minister.

3051
02:20:56,190 --> 02:20:58,790
Are you going to.
I'm doing Rachel Feinstein's wedding

3052
02:20:58,791 --> 02:21:01,670
show.
Weinstein's wedding next Saturday.

3053
02:21:01,671 --> 02:21:04,520
And shut the fuck up my fourth one.
Really?

3054
02:21:04,521 --> 02:21:05,540
You've done for.
Yeah.

3055
02:21:05,630 --> 02:21:07,910
That's beautiful.
He married people graduations.

3056
02:21:07,970 --> 02:21:08,870
Yeah,
that's a good thing.

3057
02:21:09,260 --> 02:21:10,810
Yeah.
It's uh,

3058
02:21:11,090 --> 02:21:13,160
it's really great.
I actually do really love it.

3059
02:21:13,430 --> 02:21:15,380
It becomes very real,
very fast.

3060
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:17,290
You know,
I spend a lot of time writing it in,

3061
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:21,770
but once you're up there and two people
are coming and you're doing it,

3062
02:21:21,771 --> 02:21:23,020
it's like,
no,

3063
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:26,360
this is a big deal.
This is special.

3064
02:21:26,361 --> 02:21:29,960
This is going to be unique and divorced.
It's pretty great.

3065
02:21:30,210 --> 02:21:33,530
And then it becomes a disaster.
I had no one that I married is divorced.

3066
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:34,880
Oh,
maybe got the magic touch,

3067
02:21:34,881 --> 02:21:35,331
bro.
Yeah.

3068
02:21:35,331 --> 02:21:40,010
Maybe you're the secret stuff.
The divorce rate of 50 percent in

3069
02:21:40,011 --> 02:21:41,360
America.
That's right.

3070
02:21:41,590 --> 02:21:42,261
But uh,
Chris Rock,

3071
02:21:42,261 --> 02:21:43,094
I have a joke about it.
He goes,

3072
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:45,020
he goes,
and that's just the people who have the

3073
02:21:45,021 --> 02:21:49,550
balls to leave
cowards who stay and suffer.

3074
02:21:50,350 --> 02:21:53,870
This is Chris.
This is Chris before he was divorced,

3075
02:21:53,871 --> 02:21:58,871
which is kinda really because once he
got divorced he got tay again.

3076
02:21:59,330 --> 02:21:59,960
Oh,
really?

3077
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:01,890
Tell.
Hey can.

3078
02:22:01,910 --> 02:22:04,700
I don't think he had a prenup.
So he went down hard.

3079
02:22:04,701 --> 02:22:05,780
He was onstage.
He goes,

3080
02:22:05,781 --> 02:22:08,120
he goes,
my wife made more money last year doing

3081
02:22:08,121 --> 02:22:09,530
comedy than Dave Chappelle.

3082
02:22:12,140 --> 02:22:15,910
Great Line.
Rough.

3083
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:19,250
It's rough.
It's really rough.

3084
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:22,930
For more money from comedy.
Said.

3085
02:22:23,830 --> 02:22:26,850
Geez Louise.
Tough Times out there for people.

3086
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:29,670
GotTa be funny.
Just to enjoy your life.

3087
02:22:30,660 --> 02:22:32,370
Make some bread,
make some bread.

3088
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:36,700
Celebrate with your family.
Get a little cabin in the woods.

3089
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:41,720
Salted butter,
little sticky buns.

3090
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:46,020
Why not your show?
We did eight.

3091
02:22:46,530 --> 02:22:47,670
Oh,
eight.

3092
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:50,790
And did you have any say over what
cities you chose?

3093
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:52,080
Where'd you go?
Yeah,

3094
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:55,590
we went to New York.
We went to Detroit,

3095
02:22:56,120 --> 02:22:58,260
a Los Angeles,
New Orleans,

3096
02:22:58,730 --> 02:22:59,910
uh,
cleveland.

3097
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:03,180
Um,
philly.

3098
02:23:04,850 --> 02:23:06,150
All good places.
Nice.

3099
02:23:06,151 --> 02:23:08,400
All good.
We go in and you just meet these bakers,

3100
02:23:08,410 --> 02:23:11,520
these people that are baking stuff and
making amazing stuff.

3101
02:23:11,521 --> 02:23:16,020
We do like four or five stops in each
city and they're all just great people.

3102
02:23:16,021 --> 02:23:17,940
They're just fun families.
Just,

3103
02:23:17,941 --> 02:23:21,270
you know,
making cakes and repeating the community

3104
02:23:21,271 --> 02:23:24,720
and it's great.
And do you do with your friends in these

3105
02:23:24,721 --> 02:23:25,200
towns?

3106
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:27,030
Like if you new comedians that were in
the town,

3107
02:23:27,031 --> 02:23:28,470
did you have them come with,
you know,

3108
02:23:28,500 --> 02:23:33,360
just you and Gaffigan came in New York,
so this donut shop and he was the only

3109
02:23:33,540 --> 02:23:35,790
friend that came the season,
but uh,

3110
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:37,350
I'd like to do more of that.
That would be fun.

3111
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:42,450
Now you're friends with Seinfeld and
he's a crazy porsche fanatic.

3112
02:23:42,590 --> 02:23:44,280
Yeah.
Try to get you to buy a porsche big time

3113
02:23:44,290 --> 02:23:45,123
port.
No,

3114
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:47,100
no.
He kind of knows.

3115
02:23:47,101 --> 02:23:50,220
I'm not really that big of a car guy.
Have you ever driven one?

3116
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:53,040
I did.
He let me drive one because I'd never

3117
02:23:53,041 --> 02:23:55,410
driven it.
It was like a million dollar car,

3118
02:23:57,110 --> 02:24:02,110
blue nine something
and it was just in traffic around Santa

3119
02:24:02,490 --> 02:24:03,780
Monica.
It was really a bummer.

3120
02:24:03,781 --> 02:24:06,420
It was annoying.
It was a million dollar car.

3121
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:07,530
Yeah.
Jesus.

3122
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:10,500
Yeah.
What does a million dollar car the same

3123
02:24:10,501 --> 02:24:12,180
as another car,
but they only made one of it.

3124
02:24:12,750 --> 02:24:13,830
Oh,
it's an older car.

3125
02:24:13,890 --> 02:24:15,750
Yeah,
it was from the seventies I think,

3126
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:19,080
or eighties and it would just,
they'd only made like this was like the

3127
02:24:19,081 --> 02:24:21,500
second one or something,
but uh,

3128
02:24:21,650 --> 02:24:24,600
no.
It's like if I was into it he would get

3129
02:24:24,601 --> 02:24:25,560
on me and stuff.
But,

3130
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:28,650
but you will only need around Santa
Monica.

3131
02:24:28,651 --> 02:24:32,160
Like if you get it on open road it would
be amazing.

3132
02:24:33,030 --> 02:24:34,170
Do you have a porsche?
Yeah,

3133
02:24:34,171 --> 02:24:38,300
I got one out there right now.
If you want to show you do I got a race

3134
02:24:38,301 --> 02:24:40,670
car?
A white one up there going.

3135
02:24:41,460 --> 02:24:42,540
Oh yeah,
I've seen that.

3136
02:24:42,541 --> 02:24:43,750
It does.
Jerry Seinfeld.

3137
02:24:43,830 --> 02:24:45,640
I've seen that at the store.
Oops,

3138
02:24:46,110 --> 02:24:47,520
that's not what you drove that three,
five,

3139
02:24:47,530 --> 02:24:50,760
six.
It's not a million dollar car speedsters

3140
02:24:50,770 --> 02:24:54,530
on a million dollar car.
I was probably slash 11 ass.

3141
02:24:54,570 --> 02:24:59,340
It was blue.
It's probably a nine slash 11 s from the

3142
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:01,440
seventies.
It was worth a lot of money right now.

3143
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:03,360
An Rs.
Oh yeah.

3144
02:25:03,660 --> 02:25:04,381
Yeah.
I like that one.

3145
02:25:04,381 --> 02:25:06,300
That he's got above scroll.
Scroll down.

3146
02:25:06,570 --> 02:25:08,190
That white one.
The white one.

3147
02:25:08,940 --> 02:25:10,200
Oh,
that they couldn't get in the country

3148
02:25:10,201 --> 02:25:11,034
for awhile,
right?

3149
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:12,600
One,
the white one right there.

3150
02:25:12,630 --> 02:25:13,490
There you go.
Yeah.

3151
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:14,573
That one.
Wow.

3152
02:25:14,610 --> 02:25:16,530
That's a very valuable car.
Yeah.

3153
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:20,190
That's uh,
I asked for an rs from.

3154
02:25:20,610 --> 02:25:22,950
That's funny.
Woman backs into Jerry Seinfeld.

3155
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:23,913
She

3156
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:27,370
backed into the car at three point
three.

3157
02:25:27,371 --> 02:25:29,260
Five.
Three point three.

3158
02:25:29,261 --> 02:25:30,090
Five.
What?

3159
02:25:30,090 --> 02:25:30,960
Lilian?
Yeah.

3160
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:32,680
She's.
Oh my God.

3161
02:25:32,681 --> 02:25:33,041
Yeah.
Well,

3162
02:25:33,041 --> 02:25:37,180
you know when mustangs are going for
500,000.

3163
02:25:38,650 --> 02:25:39,850
Well it says no.
No.

3164
02:25:39,851 --> 02:25:44,851
Jamie says worth between $14,000 in
three point three.

3165
02:25:45,911 --> 02:25:47,590
$5 million for right?
Yeah.

3166
02:25:47,591 --> 02:25:51,960
So some lady just backing up
a car.

3167
02:25:52,030 --> 02:25:54,820
What's the big deal?
That one of the right hand corner is a

3168
02:25:54,820 --> 02:25:57,850
million dollar car below that spider.
Upper right hand.

3169
02:25:57,880 --> 02:25:58,990
That one right there.
That's a nine.

3170
02:25:58,991 --> 02:26:00,760
18.
Is that the one you drove?

3171
02:26:00,820 --> 02:26:01,810
Yeah,
it looks like that.

3172
02:26:01,811 --> 02:26:02,591
Okay.
Yeah.

3173
02:26:02,591 --> 02:26:03,560
That's a nine.
18.

3174
02:26:03,580 --> 02:26:05,380
That's the electric.
Is that Utah pumping?

3175
02:26:05,960 --> 02:26:07,180
I'll look.
It looks like me.

3176
02:26:07,210 --> 02:26:10,030
It's the blue car that has an amazing
car.

3177
02:26:10,031 --> 02:26:14,260
That's a nice hybrid.
That wasn't it ridiculously fast car.

3178
02:26:14,860 --> 02:26:16,750
But you just sound interesting to you.
Amazing.

3179
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:18,700
That's just a boxster.
No,

3180
02:26:18,701 --> 02:26:19,720
I get into it.

3181
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:21,230
I just don't know all this.
You know,

3182
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:24,790
you gotta spend time like digesting that
are growing up with it and I didn't have

3183
02:26:24,791 --> 02:26:26,190
that,
you know,

3184
02:26:26,380 --> 02:26:27,700
I like it.
I appreciate it.

3185
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:29,080
I had a nine,
nine,

3186
02:26:29,081 --> 02:26:31,090
44 poster in my,
in my,

3187
02:26:31,091 --> 02:26:32,770
uh,
in my room.

3188
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:34,500
I remember those.
An engine.

3189
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:35,310
Yeah.
And those were,

3190
02:26:35,310 --> 02:26:38,170
you know,
it was more like the best porsches,

3191
02:26:38,171 --> 02:26:40,960
but that's what I kind of like a cool
card excited about.

3192
02:26:41,950 --> 02:26:45,220
They're very well balanced friend of
mine who drove those on a racetrack.

3193
02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:46,690
Oh yeah.
I used to race those.

3194
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:47,673
Nice.
Yeah,

3195
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,630
because it's like,
it's a very balanced car.

3196
02:26:49,750 --> 02:26:52,630
Right.
He's so deep into it,

3197
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:54,670
like his thing,
it kind of keeps him saying,

3198
02:26:54,671 --> 02:26:56,450
I think it's just,
that's where he puts his,

3199
02:26:56,460 --> 02:26:57,430
a human.
Jay Leno,

3200
02:26:57,431 --> 02:26:58,600
the extra time stuff.
Yeah.

3201
02:26:58,601 --> 02:27:00,700
It's kind of funny that they both are
doing car things.

3202
02:27:00,730 --> 02:27:02,430
Let us shows good if you've seen it.
It was,

3203
02:27:02,530 --> 02:27:03,221
I was on it.
Oh,

3204
02:27:03,221 --> 02:27:04,160
you were on it.
Yeah.

3205
02:27:04,170 --> 02:27:07,790
What were you doing in 1965?
Corvette Corvette's.

3206
02:27:08,570 --> 02:27:12,790
I've 65 corvette.
That's what you call a resto mod.

3207
02:27:13,150 --> 02:27:15,460
So the what they do is they take an old
car,

3208
02:27:15,461 --> 02:27:18,430
but they put modern suspension and
brakes and a modern engine in it.

3209
02:27:18,490 --> 02:27:20,320
Oh Nice.
So it's reliable.

3210
02:27:20,321 --> 02:27:24,400
It starts up every time.
It breaks really well in the car.

3211
02:27:24,401 --> 02:27:28,420
Guys think that that's not pure so it's
not as good and that kind of thing.

3212
02:27:31,060 --> 02:27:34,840
I just like what I like to drive.
It's like to drive an old car and to

3213
02:27:34,841 --> 02:27:36,520
keep it old.
It's to me like,

3214
02:27:37,210 --> 02:27:38,260
okay,
good luck with that.

3215
02:27:38,930 --> 02:27:41,500
You have a good time.
They can till they make it.

3216
02:27:41,501 --> 02:27:43,390
So it breaks better yet.
Definitely do that.

3217
02:27:43,950 --> 02:27:46,000
Can they make it so it handles better
either they can.

3218
02:27:46,110 --> 02:27:47,950
Where would I want to do that?
That's not how they do.

3219
02:27:48,100 --> 02:27:50,590
What am I in the Flintstone days?
No breaks.

3220
02:27:50,591 --> 02:27:52,780
Just give me a whole.
So I just stick my feet out the bottom.

3221
02:27:53,240 --> 02:27:55,900
But they get snobby about that stuff.
They can fuck off.

3222
02:27:56,880 --> 02:27:58,280
They do get snobby.
There's a guy,

3223
02:27:58,281 --> 02:27:59,620
right?
He lives up the street from me.

3224
02:27:59,630 --> 02:28:01,780
Yeah.
I had my car and I was washing it and he

3225
02:28:01,781 --> 02:28:06,781
pulled by with the same exact car,
but his was totally stock and he looked

3226
02:28:06,791 --> 02:28:09,920
at mine and immediately he could tell
like you looked at the wheels,

3227
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:14,710
a giant fat steam roller tires on it and
I mean it's just modern.

3228
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:16,380
Everything is.
And he lifted the wheels.

3229
02:28:16,400 --> 02:28:17,580
He's like,
that's not stock.

3230
02:28:17,620 --> 02:28:18,840
And I go,
no,

3231
02:28:19,060 --> 02:28:20,050
no,
it's not stock.

3232
02:28:20,530 --> 02:28:22,220
And you could see.
He's like shaking his head.

3233
02:28:22,221 --> 02:28:23,240
He's like,
when he got in the hood,

3234
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:26,630
I go,
what's a supercharged ls one with 500

3235
02:28:26,631 --> 02:28:31,631
horsepower son?
Like when you got that rickety ass

3236
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:35,540
carburetor driven fucking dinosaur
immobile,

3237
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:37,550
PPP.
Fuck out of here with your stock.

3238
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:39,470
Bullshit.
I'll give me the stink eye.

3239
02:28:39,471 --> 02:28:40,650
Sorry.
It's funny,

3240
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:43,460
but he really did.
He was looking down at me like weird.

3241
02:28:43,480 --> 02:28:48,480
Like you're not a man.
You're fast and handles good.

3242
02:28:49,470 --> 02:28:51,880
Yeah.
I want it to be pleasurable to drive.

3243
02:28:52,070 --> 02:28:53,540
Of course,
not just stare at you.

3244
02:28:53,541 --> 02:28:55,470
Fuck,
goddammit.

3245
02:28:55,550 --> 02:28:57,910
It doesn't even have the old frame.
So is everything.

3246
02:28:57,970 --> 02:29:00,170
Everything's different.
Even the frame is different.

3247
02:29:00,410 --> 02:29:02,180
Yeah,
it's going to modern frame because it's

3248
02:29:02,181 --> 02:29:05,320
like it's rigid.
Those old frames through were pulled

3249
02:29:05,330 --> 02:29:08,070
together with bubblegum fucking coat
hangers and shit

3250
02:29:11,130 --> 02:29:13,600
for real 1965 car on the highway.
You like.

3251
02:29:16,460 --> 02:29:20,300
Even my Volkswagen just has a lap belt.
Oh my corvette is a lap belt.

3252
02:29:21,050 --> 02:29:22,700
If you ever think about putting the
regular belting.

3253
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:23,613
Nope.
Nope.

3254
02:29:24,140 --> 02:29:29,140
But that you'll keep leaving a laptop.
It's also confused with carnival ride

3255
02:29:30,300 --> 02:29:32,630
route if you're lucky.
You get thrown from the car.

3256
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:39,060
How amazing is Leno's garage as though
it's insane garage yet?

3257
02:29:39,350 --> 02:29:44,350
He has 11 warehouse building,
airplane hangars filled with huge.

3258
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:46,980
It's like a museum.
It's the craziest Shit I've ever seen.

3259
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:50,240
I didn't know.
Like I knew we had a bunch of cars,

3260
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:52,310
but I didn't know and so I went.
I went down,

3261
02:29:52,311 --> 02:29:53,390
I was wandering around.
I was like,

3262
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:58,420
Holy Shit.
Maybe he took to my father and I threw

3263
02:29:59,141 --> 02:30:02,570
it like let my father come after did
this tonight show and he said,

3264
02:30:02,571 --> 02:30:03,710
come on up.
I'll give you a chart.

3265
02:30:03,711 --> 02:30:06,380
He was so nice.
I brought my father around and when he

3266
02:30:06,381 --> 02:30:07,970
was just blown away.

3267
02:30:08,030 --> 02:30:08,770
I mean,
it was,

3268
02:30:08,770 --> 02:30:11,200
you go through like miles and miles of
cars and he's like,

3269
02:30:11,390 --> 02:30:13,580
you want to see the motorcycles?
What?

3270
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:16,910
Then you go into a whole nother place
and there's just filled with bikes.

3271
02:30:16,960 --> 02:30:19,520
He drives everything in there.
It takes everything in there on the

3272
02:30:19,521 --> 02:30:20,690
road.
Everything is street legal.

3273
02:30:20,820 --> 02:30:23,720
I'm going to take the steam roller and
it takes a fucking steam roller with

3274
02:30:23,721 --> 02:30:25,910
like rubber on the tires.
There it is right there.

3275
02:30:26,350 --> 02:30:28,910
Knows fucking garage.
It's a crazy place.

3276
02:30:28,911 --> 02:30:31,160
It's so crazy.
It's gorgeous.

3277
02:30:31,220 --> 02:30:34,010
All the stuff on the walls.
All the memorabilia is insane.

3278
02:30:34,130 --> 02:30:35,450
Yeah,
it is gorgeous.

3279
02:30:35,451 --> 02:30:37,460
And he has a shop,
like full people.

3280
02:30:37,461 --> 02:30:39,730
Their mechanics working on the stuff.
Yeah.

3281
02:30:40,040 --> 02:30:44,150
With Three d printers,
making the tools and pieces and yeah,

3282
02:30:44,151 --> 02:30:47,600
he can literally make spare parts.
You can machine things.

3283
02:30:47,630 --> 02:30:51,350
Look at that.
All from Carmen Jean Shirt on.

3284
02:30:52,220 --> 02:30:55,400
Austin Tuxedo.
You add them on,

3285
02:30:55,401 --> 02:30:55,880
right?

3286
02:30:55,880 --> 02:30:56,960
Yeah.
He's great.

3287
02:30:57,020 --> 02:31:00,410
He was great.
It's so interesting hearing him swear.

3288
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:02,720
Right?
Like the people that have you never

3289
02:31:02,721 --> 02:31:05,120
heard the Jay Leno episode.
Go listen to it because he tells some

3290
02:31:05,121 --> 02:31:09,050
fucking insane stories about doing gigs
for the mob.

3291
02:31:09,230 --> 02:31:09,831
Oh,
really?

3292
02:31:09,831 --> 02:31:12,240
Yeah.
About the mob guys.

3293
02:31:12,241 --> 02:31:15,560
Like yelling at priests and like how
intense it was.

3294
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:16,533
Really?
Yeah.

3295
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:19,250
He's been around.
He's done a lot of gigs.

3296
02:31:19,390 --> 02:31:22,440
I done a lot of gigs.
He makes all of his.

3297
02:31:22,441 --> 02:31:26,630
All of his money for all the cars all
comes from comedy tonight.

3298
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:28,050
Show money.
All went to the bank.

3299
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:29,820
Is that insane?
It's crazy.

3300
02:31:29,821 --> 02:31:31,020
Like,
what are you doing with all that money,

3301
02:31:31,021 --> 02:31:33,030
Bro?
It's insane.

3302
02:31:33,860 --> 02:31:36,420
Guys on tonight show for how many years?
Yeah.

3303
02:31:36,510 --> 02:31:39,360
He refused to spend a dime of it.
Throw it all in the bank.

3304
02:31:39,570 --> 02:31:41,220
No kids,
no kids.

3305
02:31:41,670 --> 02:31:44,580
Just keep all that money.
Just shoot loads.

3306
02:31:44,581 --> 02:31:45,750
And whose car is that?
Amazing.

3307
02:31:45,751 --> 02:31:47,370
Often comedy.
Look at that.

3308
02:31:47,670 --> 02:31:50,940
Yet that front of that car is filled up
with all this backed up.

3309
02:31:50,941 --> 02:31:55,941
Come
shooting up slowly into that engine.

3310
02:31:56,550 --> 02:31:57,790
I'm sorry,
did you say what runs on?

3311
02:31:57,800 --> 02:31:59,560
Just what that card.
That card does.

3312
02:31:59,610 --> 02:32:01,290
No,
I'm not a car guy,

3313
02:32:01,291 --> 02:32:02,160
but that's weird.
Right?

3314
02:32:02,220 --> 02:32:05,610
He takes that around with them.
Imagine that lady was backing up.

3315
02:32:05,810 --> 02:32:09,630
He was always on my twitter.
I'm arguing with people that trap,

3316
02:32:12,510 --> 02:32:13,770
but million dollar cap.

3317
02:32:15,730 --> 02:32:18,550
I saw Jay once when I was in traffic.
I'm a cold water.

3318
02:32:18,760 --> 02:32:19,900
I just see this man,
you know,

3319
02:32:19,901 --> 02:32:22,600
and it's all backed up in both ways.
It's just tons of traffic.

3320
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:26,230
I see this man like running down the
center of the traffic,

3321
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:29,140
like who's this nut?
And it was jay going,

3322
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:33,370
he goes past the car,
picks up his hubcap that came off and

3323
02:32:33,371 --> 02:32:34,510
goes running back the other way.

3324
02:32:39,090 --> 02:32:42,430
He probably has to get that hubcaps
probably no other hubcap like it.

3325
02:32:42,450 --> 02:32:43,310
Right,
exactly.

3326
02:32:43,311 --> 02:32:45,630
Yeah.
Look at that thing.

3327
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:47,960
Oh my God.
That guy with them.

3328
02:32:48,570 --> 02:32:49,381
Some dude.
Oh,

3329
02:32:49,381 --> 02:32:51,630
that's richie mic rich.
Rich Richie.

3330
02:32:53,460 --> 02:32:56,460
Skinny tires and the fucking thing.
Oh my God.

3331
02:32:56,461 --> 02:32:58,140
It's so weird.
It's a good show.

3332
02:32:58,250 --> 02:33:03,250
It's so much better for him than the
tonight show in that he gets to be who

3333
02:33:04,441 --> 02:33:06,150
he is.
Completely.

3334
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:08,880
One hundred percent passionate about
cars.

3335
02:33:08,881 --> 02:33:12,210
He fucking loves cars and he knows
everything about them.

3336
02:33:12,300 --> 02:33:13,620
Yeah,
he loves it.

3337
02:33:14,310 --> 02:33:16,020
Oh,
that's that 73 Mazda.

3338
02:33:16,021 --> 02:33:19,350
That guy was actually there while I was
there.

3339
02:33:19,470 --> 02:33:22,590
He was the next one after we filmed my
episode,

3340
02:33:22,591 --> 02:33:27,060
he was waiting and he's got this crazy
73 mazda that's like fucking super

3341
02:33:27,061 --> 02:33:30,940
souped up.
Really light to see when he rolled are

3342
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:33,090
rolled a card to that video and what did
he roll?

3343
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:34,830
He rolled,
I think it was like a truck.

3344
02:33:35,400 --> 02:33:39,930
Seinfeld rolled one of his cars to kind
of like a baby roll.

3345
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:42,060
Seinfeld had a baby role.
Yeah,

3346
02:33:42,061 --> 02:33:44,100
I think it was the hospital off the off
ramp.

3347
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:45,840
No,
I don't think it was a big deal.

3348
02:33:46,380 --> 02:33:47,213
Really?
Yeah,

3349
02:33:47,370 --> 02:33:50,790
I think he went to the hospital.
You almost died.

3350
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:51,690
No.
Oh,

3351
02:33:51,691 --> 02:33:52,770
there it goes.
Yeah.

3352
02:33:52,771 --> 02:33:53,581
Look at that.
Oh,

3353
02:33:53,581 --> 02:33:54,750
it's just a car.
Oh,

3354
02:33:54,751 --> 02:33:58,010
that's a Chevelle.
Is that what is that Super Vee?

3355
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:01,260
It's hard to tell what that is.
You got to know Jesus.

3356
02:34:01,290 --> 02:34:04,230
Can you hear it?
His reaction was funny at the end.

3357
02:34:08,270 --> 02:34:11,510
No,
it wasn't an accident occurred while the

3358
02:34:11,630 --> 02:34:13,040
whole show

3359
02:34:13,410 --> 02:34:15,300
that old dude shouldn't be driving.
Yeah.

3360
02:34:15,301 --> 02:34:17,560
That's kind of the vibe that you got.
Jay was like,

3361
02:34:17,610 --> 02:34:18,443
all right.

3362
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:21,670
I mean it literally one,
two.

3363
02:34:25,070 --> 02:34:27,770
What does that got killed?
Jay Leno is too old to drive

3364
02:34:30,050 --> 02:34:32,800
the avid current.
Geez.

3365
02:34:32,810 --> 02:34:35,750
That seemed like it was a while ago.
It was several years ago,

3366
02:34:35,751 --> 02:34:37,440
I think.
Wow.

3367
02:34:37,870 --> 02:34:41,270
It's crazy.
That's when this video was put up.

3368
02:34:41,271 --> 02:34:42,110
Yeah.
Oh Wow.

3369
02:34:42,200 --> 02:34:43,033
Oh,
he gets out.

3370
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:47,720
Can you hear him
until he gets home?

3371
02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:50,630
My wife says this,
your wife,

3372
02:34:50,730 --> 02:34:53,420
Alicia and old Barracuda.
It's tough to tell what that car is.

3373
02:34:56,170 --> 02:34:57,220
Plymouth,
what is that?

3374
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,140
It isn't old Barracuda.
Oh Wow.

3375
02:35:00,590 --> 02:35:02,630
That's the first model.
Barracuda,

3376
02:35:02,631 --> 02:35:04,490
which is a totally different looking
car.

3377
02:35:04,491 --> 02:35:08,570
Then the second generation.
Wow.

3378
02:35:09,470 --> 02:35:11,630
Body styles differ.
It was a weird looking car.

3379
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:13,490
They're cool though.
Yeah.

3380
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:16,630
It's good to have an obsessive hobby.
It's good in life,

3381
02:35:16,970 --> 02:35:18,570
right?
Even if you work hard and do all this

3382
02:35:18,571 --> 02:35:21,090
stuff,
that's still extra time to put your

3383
02:35:21,091 --> 02:35:23,670
energy into something.
For me,

3384
02:35:23,671 --> 02:35:25,080
it's imperative.
Yeah.

3385
02:35:25,170 --> 02:35:27,510
I figured that out over the years of my
life.

3386
02:35:27,540 --> 02:35:30,090
Like for me,
I need mine,

3387
02:35:33,350 --> 02:35:35,720
Carla and flipped once in the comments
that they just edit it.

3388
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:38,330
Tomato look worse.
I'm trying to.

3389
02:35:38,640 --> 02:35:39,480
I was replaying.
That's.

3390
02:35:40,190 --> 02:35:41,001
Wait a minute.
Play that,

3391
02:35:41,001 --> 02:35:43,010
but no more than one.
Play it back for us.

3392
02:35:43,250 --> 02:35:46,310
I'm sorry,
some people said they saw the unedited

3393
02:35:46,311 --> 02:35:47,900
footage.
Hold on.

3394
02:35:47,990 --> 02:35:49,610
Do it again.
Do it from the beginning.

3395
02:35:51,830 --> 02:35:54,980
It looks
guys shifting.

3396
02:35:55,550 --> 02:35:56,900
Here's the flip.
Oh,

3397
02:35:56,901 --> 02:36:00,350
he hit a wheel horsepower.
No way more than 100 horsepower.

3398
02:36:01,070 --> 02:36:01,903
Let me see this guy

3399
02:36:04,370 --> 02:36:05,410
multiple times.

3400
02:36:05,740 --> 02:36:10,740
One to know that they just added the
same clip back in Atlanta that way

3401
02:36:12,420 --> 02:36:13,880
after.
Yeah,

3402
02:36:13,881 --> 02:36:16,670
I think that's true.
I think they're probably telling the

3403
02:36:16,671 --> 02:36:18,320
truth.
I think that thing probably flipped

3404
02:36:18,321 --> 02:36:20,360
once.
Whatever,

3405
02:36:20,420 --> 02:36:22,070
whatever he wants is rough.

3406
02:36:22,290 --> 02:36:24,120
It's hard to get something to flip a
bunch of times,

3407
02:36:24,121 --> 02:36:26,970
like you gotta be really flying to flip
a bunch of times,

3408
02:36:28,020 --> 02:36:30,150
flip once.
By the time all the energy would be

3409
02:36:30,151 --> 02:36:33,600
dissipated by the time he hit bang,
bang pain,

3410
02:36:33,601 --> 02:36:34,800
you know,
be careful out there.

3411
02:36:34,801 --> 02:36:37,620
Kids don't.
Especially with those old ass cars,

3412
02:36:37,650 --> 02:36:40,350
especially old ass cars with old
suspensions.

3413
02:36:40,410 --> 02:36:43,740
That's why I juice my shit up with
modern stuff.

3414
02:36:43,790 --> 02:36:45,080
Yeah,
take that neighbor,

3415
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:46,530
neighbor,
asshole.

3416
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:51,560
You fucking old drive fucking tires.
Those old crack tiredness goes out.

3417
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:56,070
Old Tires.
No tread.

3418
02:36:56,460 --> 02:36:58,200
You need a hobby.
You need stuff.

3419
02:36:58,490 --> 02:37:00,630
It's amazing.
Like you could do all this work and like

3420
02:37:00,690 --> 02:37:03,750
really hardcore at your career and
there's still extra time.

3421
02:37:03,990 --> 02:37:04,801
Well,
not just that.

3422
02:37:04,801 --> 02:37:09,060
I think doing one thing only all the
time is not good for the brain.

3423
02:37:09,780 --> 02:37:13,380
I think it's good for the brain to be
excited by a bunch of different things.

3424
02:37:13,470 --> 02:37:15,740
Interesting.
I think it makes you more person and

3425
02:37:15,741 --> 02:37:19,490
makes it more interesting with as a
comic is I think is very important.

3426
02:37:20,090 --> 02:37:24,860
It's very important to have a more
nuanced perspective to also have more

3427
02:37:24,861 --> 02:37:27,450
information to draw from that.
Like you're,

3428
02:37:27,460 --> 02:37:30,950
you're experiencing more different parts
of La and also different types of

3429
02:37:30,951 --> 02:37:33,380
failure.
I think different types of failure is

3430
02:37:33,381 --> 02:37:34,630
good for you.
Absolutely.

3431
02:37:34,840 --> 02:37:37,220
It go failure.
Mental failure,

3432
02:37:37,400 --> 02:37:39,830
complication failed.
I think all that stuff's good for

3433
02:37:39,940 --> 02:37:41,700
something that you're not good at.
Yes.

3434
02:37:41,701 --> 02:37:43,040
It's amazing.
Yes.

3435
02:37:43,110 --> 02:37:47,100
It's amazing how many times you will
feel like a beginner back at the same

3436
02:37:47,101 --> 02:37:49,320
thing you've been practicing.
Like if you start making changes,

3437
02:37:49,470 --> 02:37:50,250
like,
oh,

3438
02:37:50,250 --> 02:37:51,840
I'm kind of back to the beginning of
this again.

3439
02:37:51,930 --> 02:37:56,040
What do you do other than the baking?
The baking is the biggest thing.

3440
02:37:56,250 --> 02:37:58,800
The baking is like,
it's really like my first hobby.

3441
02:37:58,801 --> 02:38:00,870
I never really had something like that.
Yeah.

3442
02:38:00,990 --> 02:38:05,430
I put all my time into.
It was always just stand up and then.

3443
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:06,300
And then,
uh,

3444
02:38:06,300 --> 02:38:09,210
the baking and now I'm writing more than
ever before.

3445
02:38:09,390 --> 02:38:11,610
So I'm like writing,
sitting down,

3446
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:14,410
writing,
concentrated for long periods of writing

3447
02:38:14,590 --> 02:38:16,330
comedy or just writing,
writing.

3448
02:38:16,390 --> 02:38:17,710
It depends.
You know,

3449
02:38:17,800 --> 02:38:21,130
I have that.
I'm the head writer for live from here,

3450
02:38:21,131 --> 02:38:22,510
the prairie home companion thing.

3451
02:38:23,220 --> 02:38:26,700
And is that garrison keillor?
They kicks him out.

3452
02:38:26,730 --> 02:38:27,660
That's the new thing.
Well,

3453
02:38:27,661 --> 02:38:30,600
he quits.
He retired before he got in trouble.

3454
02:38:30,601 --> 02:38:32,180
He retired a couple of years before.
Oh,

3455
02:38:32,190 --> 02:38:33,023
he did?
Yeah.

3456
02:38:33,180 --> 02:38:35,040
And that's why the.
But once he got in trouble,

3457
02:38:35,041 --> 02:38:38,640
that's when the name of getting in
trouble thing was before he even

3458
02:38:38,641 --> 02:38:40,930
retired.
Like it was an incident from both.

3459
02:38:41,220 --> 02:38:42,060
Yes,
yes.

3460
02:38:42,150 --> 02:38:43,350
Yeah,
it was an old thing.

3461
02:38:43,440 --> 02:38:45,970
It was kind of a muddled thing.
Very weird one.

3462
02:38:46,900 --> 02:38:50,220
But when I had said that on the podcast
that it was weird and then he just kind

3463
02:38:50,221 --> 02:38:51,960
of hugged a chick and his hand went down
her back.

3464
02:38:52,230 --> 02:38:55,950
Then someone sent me an article that
there was more than one incident,

3465
02:38:56,370 --> 02:39:00,630
several of them and that he had been and
they didn't make them public and I don't

3466
02:39:00,631 --> 02:39:01,620
even know what they were,

3467
02:39:01,790 --> 02:39:04,310
but I know they had to.
They did investigate it,

3468
02:39:04,970 --> 02:39:07,550
but they had to end up changing the name
of it.

3469
02:39:07,551 --> 02:39:10,160
So anyway,
I spent a lot of time writing for that.

3470
02:39:10,730 --> 02:39:15,230
Then it went really from writing my book
and then I got that Gig.

3471
02:39:15,231 --> 02:39:18,240
So I continued writing at that pace and
uh,

3472
02:39:18,980 --> 02:39:21,050
and now I'm continuing to write like
that.

3473
02:39:21,051 --> 02:39:24,330
So I,
if the writing is the,

3474
02:39:24,350 --> 02:39:27,530
is kind of a,
it's weird because it's from doing

3475
02:39:27,531 --> 02:39:30,020
standup writing this,
it almost seems like something new.

3476
02:39:30,021 --> 02:39:34,160
It almost seems like another hobby.
Another different way to exercise your

3477
02:39:34,161 --> 02:39:35,090
mind.
Yeah,

3478
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:37,210
it's different.
It's different sitting there like

3479
02:39:37,250 --> 02:39:38,830
writing stuff out,
like really parsing out.

3480
02:39:39,140 --> 02:39:43,320
But it does make me think like,
and I haven't been able to crack it of

3481
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:48,360
like why not put that effort of that
intense writing style into the standup?

3482
02:39:49,580 --> 02:39:51,260
You don't do that?
No,

3483
02:39:51,290 --> 02:39:53,150
I'll,
I'm looser with it.

3484
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:57,290
I'll write it and they'll go perform it
and then I'll come back and edit it,

3485
02:39:57,620 --> 02:40:02,620
but that Carlin did that at the end.
He would just write the whole thing and

3486
02:40:03,321 --> 02:40:04,520
memorize it,
you know,

3487
02:40:04,521 --> 02:40:07,340
he would like,
like a book and then go present it.

3488
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:08,810
I haven't gotten,
I haven't done that.

3489
02:40:08,850 --> 02:40:09,670
I do do that.
That's

3490
02:40:09,670 --> 02:40:10,503
the.
No,

3491
02:40:10,610 --> 02:40:12,080
no.
What I do is,

3492
02:40:12,081 --> 02:40:14,130
um,
I do two things.

3493
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:17,220
One,
I write a premises in word and then I

3494
02:40:17,221 --> 02:40:22,221
have a program called scrivener.
Scrivener does is it lets me take things

3495
02:40:22,471 --> 02:40:25,890
into prem,
into categories or into subjects.

3496
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:27,870
So I have like,
I'm like,

3497
02:40:27,871 --> 02:40:30,130
I have a title of a set,
right?

3498
02:40:30,330 --> 02:40:33,360
I'll call it,
like my last special's called the one

3499
02:40:33,361 --> 02:40:35,190
that's coming out.
It's called strange times.

3500
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:39,150
So I wrote strange times at the top of
it and then I have all these different

3501
02:40:39,151 --> 02:40:42,840
subjects in strange times and then I can
move them around,

3502
02:40:42,870 --> 02:40:45,180
I can shift them and each time I click
on one,

3503
02:40:45,210 --> 02:40:48,990
it takes me to all the stuff that I've
written about that subject.

3504
02:40:49,240 --> 02:40:53,420
And then I also can click on another
little part of it and it shows me a cork

3505
02:40:53,421 --> 02:40:56,070
board and on the corkboard is like
these,

3506
02:40:56,860 --> 02:41:00,120
um,
which called virtual index cards,

3507
02:41:01,170 --> 02:41:04,530
the index cards that I can move around
each index card as like notes on

3508
02:41:04,531 --> 02:41:05,110
different parts.

3509
02:41:05,110 --> 02:41:06,780
Like this is a very important part of
the bit.

3510
02:41:06,810 --> 02:41:09,000
This is a,
this is a note about a study that was

3511
02:41:09,001 --> 02:41:12,690
done that shows that this is real,
all these different things and so I can

3512
02:41:12,691 --> 02:41:15,570
move those around.
But this way I can look at it in the

3513
02:41:15,571 --> 02:41:18,180
little tiny side.
We're all,

3514
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:22,980
each individually individual subject is
all in this one long column and I could

3515
02:41:22,981 --> 02:41:27,120
see like the set,
like this is a whole set but then,

3516
02:41:27,250 --> 02:41:32,220
but no matter what,
it has to be really ironed out in front

3517
02:41:32,221 --> 02:41:35,580
of an audience because I can write as
much as I want.

3518
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:39,240
And a lot of it is effective writing
alone.

3519
02:41:39,510 --> 02:41:42,000
But it comes to life in front of an
audience and changes.

3520
02:41:42,001 --> 02:41:42,834
Yeah.
Yeah.

3521
02:41:42,990 --> 02:41:45,870
But how much will you write before you
bring it out?

3522
02:41:45,871 --> 02:41:48,980
Like will you write a couple pages into
it or just

3523
02:41:49,030 --> 02:41:50,760
little depends,
you know,

3524
02:41:50,960 --> 02:41:55,020
sometimes it's thousands of words for a
couple minute bit.

3525
02:41:55,340 --> 02:41:57,170
And you'll take that up before you've
tried it.

3526
02:41:57,171 --> 02:41:58,300
You write a thousand?
Yes,

3527
02:41:59,420 --> 02:42:02,120
sometimes.
And sometimes it's just a few lines and

3528
02:42:02,121 --> 02:42:06,200
then I just run with a premise.
Sometimes I'll just try to try to air a

3529
02:42:06,201 --> 02:42:09,770
premise out and see where it goes.
There's one that I'm working on right

3530
02:42:09,771 --> 02:42:12,770
now that I have,
so the,

3531
02:42:12,990 --> 02:42:17,120
the setup of the premise gets a really
big laugh and that I don't know where to

3532
02:42:17,121 --> 02:42:20,000
go with it over here and I'm fucking
around with it and I'm trying to figure

3533
02:42:20,001 --> 02:42:22,430
out where,
where to go with Dell or something there

3534
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:25,070
and I'm not going to let it go.
But every day I throw a little bit of

3535
02:42:25,071 --> 02:42:27,350
water on it and I hope to see the
sprouts.

3536
02:42:27,540 --> 02:42:28,300
Yeah.
And it's,

3537
02:42:28,300 --> 02:42:30,390
you know,
if you've got a great premise,

3538
02:42:30,400 --> 02:42:31,530
there's,
there is a great job,

3539
02:42:31,630 --> 02:42:34,440
there's something there definitely.
But it's one of those ones where I know,

3540
02:42:34,441 --> 02:42:35,970
okay,
I can't let this go.

3541
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,350
I know there's something there,
but right now

3542
02:42:37,550 --> 02:42:41,750
shit Finna take awhile.
It can be the only one that believes in

3543
02:42:41,751 --> 02:42:43,520
this.
I know.

3544
02:42:43,521 --> 02:42:44,960
It's amazing.
It's so funny.

3545
02:42:44,961 --> 02:42:47,180
I was reading something about a raccoon
the other day.

3546
02:42:47,450 --> 02:42:50,020
I saw a raccoon with her hands and I
was.

3547
02:42:50,030 --> 02:42:52,310
As I was writing about it,
I was like,

3548
02:42:52,340 --> 02:42:54,290
wait a minute,
and I looked through my notes.

3549
02:42:54,370 --> 02:42:58,430
It's like I thought I had a really good
raccoon bit a year ago

3550
02:43:01,270 --> 02:43:05,060
in the audience told me this wasn't very
good and I ended up quitting on it and

3551
02:43:05,061 --> 02:43:07,130
now I'm,
I'm back with my new rec,

3552
02:43:09,750 --> 02:43:11,980
let it go and then walk around it,
look at it

3553
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:15,580
from the back and then walk around it,
look at it from the side and then maybe

3554
02:43:15,581 --> 02:43:18,460
sometimes something happens and you go,
oh my fucking raccoon bit.

3555
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:21,900
You go through your notes.
Oh

3556
02:43:29,140 --> 02:43:30,730
Tom Pop.
It's already 4:00.

3557
02:43:31,240 --> 02:43:32,680
Time flies.
Oh my God,

3558
02:43:32,690 --> 02:43:34,810
you're crazy the fuck bro.
I know.

3559
02:43:34,811 --> 02:43:37,360
When I was coming here I was like,
I don't know if I got three hours in me

3560
02:43:37,361 --> 02:43:39,220
today.
That's the last thing you said last time

3561
02:43:39,221 --> 02:43:40,560
we were here.
Isn't really,

3562
02:43:41,190 --> 02:43:43,440
is it really one of them?
She said,

3563
02:43:43,450 --> 02:43:46,330
what are we going to talk about?
We'll just start talking.

3564
02:43:46,450 --> 02:43:51,450
It always flies tom population.
