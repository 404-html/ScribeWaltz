1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,280
The joe rogan experience,
we're also paying for the sins of a lot

2
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:05,260
of other people.
Like for centuries,

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,040
let's,
you know,

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,220
white American men dominated everything
in this country.

5
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:09,760
And,
and like,

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,400
you know,
there's also a reality of a lot of

7
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:16,420
people were treated like garbage for a
long time and a lot of promises were

8
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:18,400
broken.
And there's a reality to that.

9
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:20,240
That's not excuse making,
it's not right.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,920
It's a real thing.
And,

11
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,040
and then they say,
well,

12
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:27,250
you know why people have benefited from
that system even to,

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,670
so what's happening is in an effort to
balance the fucking playing field a

14
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:33,370
little bit,
a lot of us today are being treated

15
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:36,900
unfairly because the balancing act is
making things go so far.

16
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,200
Like I do understand that.
Like,

17
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:41,650
that's why I had a conversation after a
Tashas.

18
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,970
Uh,
uh,

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,930
and who did they get?
Oh,

20
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,280
Tracy's gay jokes.

21
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,590
And I had a couple of days from folks
who don't know,

22
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:50,650
Tracy Morgan did a joke about if his son
was gay,

23
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:51,650
he would stab them.
Yeah.

24
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,730
And everybody went crazy.
And I had a couple of gay comics on Rick

25
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,340
Chrome and Jim David and we talked about
this on this comedy special I did.

26
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,140
And uh,
the as Comedians,

27
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,690
I asked them how do they feel about the
imbalance in the language?

28
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:03,490
Like the fact that you get in trouble
for that now.

29
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,380
And Jim David said,
I'm okay with it.

30
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,880
And uh,
I'm like,

31
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:08,260
well how are you okay with there's a
comic?

32
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:09,940
And he goes,
cause it's not a level playing field.

33
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,490
Meaning what he thought was like in
life,

34
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:15,400
gay people had not treated as well.
So he didn't give a shit if,

35
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,640
if that guy got in a little bit more
trouble and I kind of,

36
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:19,930
I heard what he said,
they're like,

37
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,580
even though I don't want to get in
trouble for it,

38
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,530
in that sense he was right.

39
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,970
It's like,
you know,

40
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,780
we still have a big segment of our
country that can't get married and

41
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:30,700
they're treated like second class
citizens,

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,580
but yet we go around and tell other
countries had to live their lives were

43
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:35,560
so fully shit.
It makes me nuts.

44
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,870
Well,
I think there's a real legitimate

45
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:39,910
argument in the,
uh,

46
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:44,911
idea that until it balances out,
until everyone completely relaxes on

47
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,310
discrimination towards gays.
Like,

48
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,160
like there's no discrimination on
bachelors anymore.

49
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,740
You know,
like if a man is a 50 year old man,

50
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:55,150
he says,
I'm just not getting married again.

51
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:58,120
There's no discrimination or social pro.
He's not a social pariah.

52
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,630
But if he decides to marry a man than it
is like,

53
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:02,201
well what?
Well,

54
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:05,340
what is that and why is that not
eradicated from our culture yet?

55
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,880
Well,
once that is eradicated from our

56
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:10,360
culture,
then I shank people are going to be much

57
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:13,210
more likely to accept gay jokes much
more like,

58
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,360
because I keep hearing that gay jokes or
homophobic and I'm like,

59
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:16,810
guess what?

60
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,590
No,
they're not.

61
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,020
It's not homophobic at all.
It's a gay joke.

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
Just like jokes about straight sex
aren't Hetero volvic alright,

63
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,050
they're jokes about sex and there's,
there's,

64
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:29,890
there's jokes about everything and it's
really about context.

65
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:33,640
It's not about the subject matter and
you can't eliminate certain subject

66
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:35,980
matters.
You just can't because the human

67
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:39,490
language is very nuance.
There's a lot of shit going on in every

68
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:43,510
single interaction that you have.
We're humor could potentially be crafted

69
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,880
from,
it can be taken into a whole wide

70
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:49,510
variety of different ways,
and I like all of those ways.

71
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,180
I like people saying fucked up shit.
They don't really mean.

72
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:55,000
Sure.
I think this something funny and Tracy

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,870
Morgan saying if a photo,
most of them was good,

74
00:02:56,871 --> 00:03:00,010
I still be a little new glue and it's
ridiculous.

75
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,660
It's ludicrous,
right?

76
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,120
It's not real.
Of course he wouldn't do that.

77
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,010
Of course it would be,
you know,

78
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,420
it's,
it's ridiculous.

79
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,540
The idea that it's like,
I do a joke in my act like guess what,

80
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,840
Johnny Cash didn't really shoot a man in
Reno just to watch him die either.

81
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,370
Maybe it's,
I don't think he did.

82
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,150
He might more likely that he did it then
Tracy Morgan would stab his son.

83
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,840
Yeah.
So bid johnny,

84
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,480
johnny,
Johnny Cash probably should have said I

85
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:24,520
took some pills and fell asleep on the
tour bus.

86
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,150
I'd be more accurate.
Longest boxing match ever.

87
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:28,984
Let's find out.

88
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,130
Match ever boiled typing

89
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,050
was the longest boxing match in history.
Oh my God,

90
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,930
a boxing match land.
It lasted seven hours.

91
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,870
How many,
if I can do the math man,

92
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,880
what the fuck is that?
Is that real?

93
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:48,900
Okay.

94
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,150
Oh my God.
Listen to this.

95
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,460
The longest boxing match ever took place
in New Orleans on April six of 1893 the

96
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:58,770
matches between Andy Bowen and Jack
Burke,

97
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,140
both of whom claimed the lightweight
title after the reigning Champ,

98
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,010
Jack McCall,
full all of fee,

99
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,700
all a fee check my call if he retired,
the winner of this take all purse was

100
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:13,680
set at $2,500 and in order to decide who
is really the new champion,

101
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,970
the match was set to fought to a finish.
They fought to a finish.

102
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,890
I like that.
All through the contest,

103
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:23,070
fighters went at each other aggressively
pounding each other with their gloves,

104
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,500
inflicting and sustaining tremendous
punishment.

105
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,170
That red,
like someone wrote it with their pants

106
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:30,260
off.
That red light is a vigorous.

107
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,810
They masturbating oiled up and shaved
and ah,

108
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,080
yet three minute rounds wore off.
Oh my God.

109
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:42,081
They went to 111 rounds.
Both fighters,

110
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,000
dazed and weary gave up.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,180
And did not come out of their corner
pools.

112
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,090
Well,
you can't fight on hundred and 12th

113
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:56,091
around how to be one guy telling him
just get up rocky and your win.

114
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,810
Guinness Guinness says it's 276 rounds
in 1825 that's the English people.

115
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,860
Why might we heard it much longer than
that?

116
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,180
Our endurance is superior.
We've proper boxing training.

117
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,630
That sounded more South African,
so maybe they're right,

118
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:16,530
man.
I Dunno.

119
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
Whoever fought over a hundred rounds is
the craziest fucking human being that's

120
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:21,240
ever lived.
That fight was only four and a half

121
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:22,260
hours.
Oh,

122
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:24,060
that's weird.
What do they have a 32nd rounds?

123
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,560
Hmm.
It doesn't even make sense.

124
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:27,010
I can't even do the math.
All right.

125
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,600
I'm not going to try 2,500 bucks.
That's crazy.

126
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,720
Yeah.

127
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,820
For the welter,
the welterweight championship of the

128
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:37,360
world are lightweight rather these days.
That's a good question.

129
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,670
It's a very good question.
I've been to be like 1 million bucks.

130
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,170
Yeah.
Is that weird?

131
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,770
Like when when you hear about like
economies imploding and then all of a

132
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:46,870
sudden like a loaf of bread is worth $1
million,

133
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:49,030
like how the fuck,
what does that even mean?

134
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,800
Yeah.
I don't even understand that people have

135
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,710
billions of dollars.
How does that number even a real number

136
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,100
and can I,
how do you pull out $1 billion in cash?

137
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,740
Me?
See?

138
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,750
Yeah.
At a certain point in time you have to

139
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:02,300
admit the hack the game.
Okay.

140
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,650
You acting game somehow,
dude,

141
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,380
how'd you get $10 billion?
I don't understand.

142
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,730
When you know you gotta like Bill Gates,
you have submarine and inside your giant

143
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,510
bear,
you know like,

144
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,560
Hey,
what happened here?

145
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,080
What exactly did you do?
Where are you getting all that money?

146
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,360
This is,
this isn't fair.

147
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,050
We have escape pause in your house to
jettison you to the middle of the

148
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:23,390
fucking ocean whenever it fucking danger
shows up.

149
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah.
You have a constant team of security

150
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,890
detail around you that's like having a
bank,

151
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,370
you know around you all the time.
Bill Gates is worth what?

152
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:33,440
100 billion or something crazy like
that.

153
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,550
It would have.
It was the whole Jv,

154
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:37,220
him dropping $40,000 he shouldn't pick
it up kind of thing.

155
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,180
Yeah,
that's what they say.

156
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,770
It's like if he drops $40,000 it's worth
more of his time to keep moving forward

157
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,270
than it is to turn around and pick it
up.

158
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,460
He just,
what?

159
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:48,200
What happened was he just didn't turn
around and pickup the bonus.

160
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:52,640
I just got almost for,
for bludgeoning and other man for 15

161
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:53,630
minutes.
He,

162
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:55,490
if he dropped that,
he wouldn't pick it up,

163
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,000
son.
Oh Shit.

164
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,540
Itunes or recording to server the fuck
outta here.

165
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,110
Server.
