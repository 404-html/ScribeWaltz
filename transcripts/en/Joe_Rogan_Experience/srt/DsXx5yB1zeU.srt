1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,280
The Joe Rogan experience,
we're also paying for the sins of a lot

2
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:05,410
of other people,
like for centuries let's,

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,710
you know,
white American men dominated everything

4
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:10,000
in this country and like,
you know,

5
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:14,590
there's also a reality of a lot of
people were treated like garbage for a

6
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:18,400
long time and a lot of promises were
broken and there's a reality to that.

7
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:20,080
That's not excuse making,
it's not,

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,620
it's a real thing.
And then they say,

9
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:26,410
well,
you know why people have benefited from

10
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:28,900
that system leading to.
So what's happening is in an effort to

11
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:33,370
balance the playing field a little bit,
a lot of us today are being treated

12
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:37,390
unfairly because the balancing act is
making things go so far and like I do

13
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:40,960
understand that.
That's why I had a conversation after a

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,790
tosh has a 10.
Who did they get?

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,310
Oh,
Tracy's gay jokes.

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,590
And I had to get from folks who don't
know,

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,350
Tracy Morgan did a joke about if someone
was gay who had stabbed them.

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,960
Yeah.
And everybody went crazy and I had a

19
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:55,300
couple of gay comics on Rick Chrome,
Jim David,

20
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:57,340
and we talked about this on this comedy
special I did.

21
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,140
And uh,
the as Comedians,

22
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,690
I asked them how do they feel about the
imbalance in the language,

23
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:04,640
like the fact that you get in trouble
for that now and Jim Davidson,

24
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,430
I'm okay with it.
And uh,

25
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,001
I'm like,
well,

26
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,560
how are you okay with it as a comic?
And he goes,

27
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:12,250
because it's not a level playing field,
meaning what he thought was like in

28
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:14,020
life,
gay people had not treated as well,

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,260
so he didn't give a shit if,
if that guy got into a little bit more

30
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:18,640
trouble.
And I kind of,

31
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:19,910
I heard what he said.
They're like,

32
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,580
even though I don't want to get in
trouble for it,

33
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,530
in that sense,
he was right.

34
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:24,970
It's like,
you know,

35
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,780
we still have a big segment of our
country that can't get married and

36
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:30,700
they're treated like second class
citizens.

37
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,610
But yet we go around and tell other
countries how to live their lives were

38
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:35,560
so full of shit.
It makes me nuts.

39
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,850
Well,
I think there's a real legitimate

40
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:42,851
argument in the idea that until it
balances out,

41
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,050
until everyone completely relaxes on
discrimination towards gays,

42
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:50,210
like,
like there's no discrimination on

43
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,090
bachelors anymore,
you know,

44
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,020
like if a man has a 50 year old man,
he says,

45
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:56,780
I'm just not getting married again,
there's no discrimination or social,

46
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,650
not a social pariah,
but if he decides to marry a man than it

47
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:02,060
is like,
well what?

48
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:03,920
Well,
what is that and why is that not

49
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:05,510
eradicated from our culture that?
Well,

50
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:07,370
once that is eradicated from our
culture,

51
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,760
then I think people are going to be much
more likely to accept gay jokes much

52
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,110
more like.
Because I keep hearing that gay jokes or

53
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:16,820
homophobic and I'm like,
guess what?

54
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,560
No,
they're not.

55
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,030
It's not homophobic at all.
It's a gay joke.

56
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,630
Just like ha jokes about straight sex
aren't header of Bobek.

57
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,920
Alright.
There are jokes about sex and there's,

58
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,900
there's jokes about everything and it's
really about context.

59
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:33,620
It's not about the subject matter and
you can't eliminate certain subject

60
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,990
matters.
You just can't because the human

61
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:39,500
language is very nuanced.
There's a lot of shit going on and every

62
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:43,520
single interaction that you have,
we're humor could potentially be crafted

63
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:46,580
from.
It can be taken in a whole wide variety

64
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:49,490
of different ways and I like all of
those ways.

65
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,190
I like people saying fucked up shit.
They don't really mean.

66
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:54,290
Sure.
I think there's something funny and

67
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,810
Tracy Morgan saying if a photo most
good.

68
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,480
I mean it's ridiculous.
It's ludicrous,

69
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,650
right?
It's not real.

70
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:05,440
Of course he wouldn't do that.
Of course it would be.

71
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,570
You know,
it's,

72
00:03:06,571 --> 00:03:08,560
it's ridiculous.
The idea that it's like,

73
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,930
I do a joke.
I'm like,

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,010
guess what?
Johnny cash didn't really shoot a man in

75
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,120
Reno just to watch him die either.
Maybe.

76
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,470
I don't think he did.
He might have more likely that he did

77
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:19,150
it.
Then Tracy Morgan would establish son,

78
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,100
stupid johnny.
Johnny.

79
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,040
Johnny cash probably should have said I
took some pills and fell asleep on the

80
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,690
tour bus.
They might be more accurate.

81
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,810
Longest boxing match ever.
Let's find out.

82
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,090
March ever typing

83
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,050
was the longest boxing match in history.
Oh my God.

84
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,550
A boxing match landed.
Lasted seven hours already.

85
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,560
If I can do the man fuck is that.
Is that real?

86
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,180
Oh my God.
Listen to this.

87
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,710
The longest boxing match ever took place
in New Orleans on April sixth of 18,

88
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:58,770
93.
The matches between Andy Bowen and Jack

89
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,720
Burke,
both of whom claimed the lightweight

90
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,140
title.
After the reigning champ,

91
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:06,390
Jack Mccall full all of fee all fluffy
Jack Mccall.

92
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:08,730
If he retired,
the winner of this take all purse was

93
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:13,650
set at $2,500 and in order to decide who
is really the new champion,

94
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,050
that match was set to fought to a
finish.

95
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,890
They fought to a finish like that all
through the contest.

96
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:23,070
Fighters went at each other aggressively
pounding each other with their gloves,

97
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:27,630
inflicting and sustaining tremendous
punishment that read like someone wrote

98
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:31,750
it with their pants off.
That Red Light is vigorously oiled,

99
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,270
up and shaved and are yet three minute
rounds wore off.

100
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,860
Oh my God.
They went to a hundred and 11 rounds.

101
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,170
Both fighters,
dazed and weary gave up and did not come

102
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,010
out of their corner.

103
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,570
Pull zoos or you can't fight one hundred
and twelfth round.

104
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,880
We'll move.
It'd be one guy telling them,

105
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:58,140
just get up rocky here and you'll win
Guinness.

106
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,340
Guinness says it's 276 rounds in 18,
25 English people might.

107
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,240
We heard it much longer than that.
We are.

108
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:12,150
Endurance is superior with proper boxing
training.

109
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,960
That sounded more South African,
so maybe they're right man.

110
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,420
I don't know.
Whoever fought over 100 rounds is the

111
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:20,100
craziest fucking human being that's ever
lived.

112
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,720
That fight was only four and a half
hours.

113
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,823
Oh,
that's weird.

114
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,560
One of the 32nd rounds.
It doesn't even make sense.

115
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:29,400
I can't even do the math.
I'm not going to try 2,500 bucks.

116
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,743
That's crazy.

117
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,180
For the welter with a welterweight
championship of the world,

118
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,360
what are lightweight rather these days?
It's a good question.

119
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,670
It's a very good question.
I've been at building a million bucks.

120
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,200
Yeah.
Is that weird?

121
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,310
Like when you hear about like economies
imploding and then all of a sudden like

122
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,870
a loaf of bread is worth a million
dollars.

123
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,000
How the fuck,
what does that even mean?

124
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,800
Yeah.
I don't even understand that people have

125
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,710
billions of dollars.
How does that number even a real number

126
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,100
and can I have you?
I'll pull out a billion dollars in cash.

127
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,100
Let me see.
Yeah.

128
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,280
At a certain point in time,
you have to admit the hack the game.

129
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,410
Okay.
You hacked the game somehow.

130
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:04,880
Dude,
how'd you get $10,000,000,000?

131
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,360
Don't understand.
When you know you're a guy like Bill

132
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,730
Gates,
you have submarine inside your giant

133
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:11,520
bear.
You know like,

134
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,590
Hey,
what happened here?

135
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,760
What did exactly that you do?

136
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,320
Where are you getting all that money is
this.

137
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,340
This isn't fair.
You have escape pause in your house to

138
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,770
jettison you to the middle of the
fucking ocean.

139
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:24,340
Whenever it fucking dangerous shows up.
Yeah.

140
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,720
You have a constant team of security
detail run you.

141
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,480
That's like having a bank.
You know around you all the time.

142
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,050
Bill Gates is worth what?
A hundred billion or something crazy

143
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:34,550
like that.
It would have fit with that whole jv.

144
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:37,190
Him dropping $40,000.
He shouldn't pick it up kind of thing.

145
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,180
Yeah,
that's what they say.

146
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,900
It's like if he drops $40,000,
it's worth more of his time to keep

147
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,240
moving forward than it is to turn around
and pick it up.

148
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,060
He just was.
What happened was he just didn't turn

149
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:49,870
around to pick up the bonus.
I just got almost for,

150
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:53,000
for bludgeoning another man for 15
minutes.

151
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,560
He,
if he dropped that,

152
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,740
he wouldn't pick it up.
Oh Shit.

153
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,570
Itunes or recording to server,
get the fuck outta here.

154
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:28,140
Server.
