1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,850
Five,
four,

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:04,710
three,
two.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,900
Hello,
nick and Joe,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,340
sorry for the delay.
We had a a failure.

5
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:15,150
Ladies and gentlemen,
catastrophic failure of windows updating

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,373
it,
sort of a updated and hung on the 

7
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,510
tricaster,
but we're back and it seems to be fine.

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,460
Everything's working.
Allegedly,

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,370
allegedly.
There's a,

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,850
there's that fear when you're like,
fuck,

11
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:28,680
I'm turning off the update.
I'm going to start again.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,140
The unit is everything.
That is the one annoying thing.

13
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:32,670
We were talking about this before the 
podcast.

14
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:35,430
I have been using windows to write on 
and I like,

15
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:37,220
uh,
the thinkpad I really like.

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,000
I love the keyboard.
It's great to write on,

17
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:42,900
but windows updates like two or three 
times a day sometimes.

18
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,213
Not just windows,
but like Lenovo will update and there's 

19
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:47,664
some sort of firmware update and the 
bios update and Adobe Acrobat checking 

20
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:56,010
in and want to know if we can be 
defender updates.

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,130
Yeah,
the uh,

22
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:57,963
I haven't used the thinkpad.
They got this little clip right in the 

23
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,970
middle.
I don't use it.

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,270
I guess it's for people that have been 
using it for ever.

25
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,210
It's very accurate if you do use it 
right.

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,180
It's like one of those things where you 
just sort of used to muscle memory.

27
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:13,014
You're used to doing it and then they 
touch the other buttons with their 

28
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:15,660
thumb.
Right.

29
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:16,494
Good.
They can still do shit and it has the 

30
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,460
mouse at the keypad.
It has both.

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,760
It's so weird how quickly you become 
accustomed to some new version of things

32
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,594
like I,
I've been using my ipad and I it and 

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,513
then I've gone back to my computer and 
my little Mac book and I find even that 

34
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:34,100
weird like I find myself just wanting to
touch the screen.

35
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,590
I have my muscle memory is immediately 
shot.

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,470
That's one thing that's very odd about 
Mac computers.

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,010
They still have it embraced the 
touchscreen laptop,

38
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,293
whereas the thinkpad acts has a touch 
screen or you can straight up use this 

39
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:49,680
screen on it.
Yeah.

40
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,860
It's an option.
Have one that has a touch screen and one

41
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:55,380
that does not,
but that's a lot of windows.

42
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,214
Computers have touchscreens and they 
even have it so you can turn it into a 

43
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:01,620
tablet.
You flipped it over and it.

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,990
I think they call it the yoga,
the thinkpad,

45
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:04,824
Yoga,
and then Microsoft has one the surface 

46
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:08,040
or something like that.
Yeah.

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,180
Apple's like,
no,

48
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,680
we want to sell you two different 
things.

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,060
That's exactly what it is.
We're not combining their dirty people.

50
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,090
They really are.
That fucking battery thing really pissed

51
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:19,550
me off.
Did it come out?

52
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:21,900
Did it finally get officially admitted 
it?

53
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:23,210
Oh yeah.
They said they,

54
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:26,100
they admitted it and they said they did 
it because the old phones,

55
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:27,360
they were trying to preserve the 
battery.

56
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,350
The fuck you were.
You were trying to piss people off.

57
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,600
So they got a new phone.
Yeah,

58
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,703
we,
we all know exactly what it works on me 

59
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,081
every year and a half for.
I'm like,

60
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,120
why does my phone fucking dying every 10
minutes?

61
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:40,590
And I'm like,
I gotta get a new phone,

62
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,900
dirty people,
dirty people.

63
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,640
I got the new one,
I got the new.

64
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:46,710
Uh,
the new is the,

65
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,540
uh,
the uh,

66
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,080
whatever the iphone asked Max.
It's too big.

67
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,460
I fucked up.
Is it too big?

68
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,010
I've never gone to the bigger one.
I've always gotten this,

69
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:56,970
this size.
Walmart.

70
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,520
It was perfect.
Yeah.

71
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,310
Yeah,
but I got greedy.

72
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,260
I want to go back.
They have some of those now.

73
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:05,160
The smaller like the four of the five,
that little size.

74
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:05,994
Why anyone was aware.
Someone had one the other day and I had 

75
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:08,860
it in my hand.
I was like,

76
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,600
Ooh,
this is nice.

77
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,490
Yeah,
you can text with one hand.

78
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,450
Yeah,
exactly.

79
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:17,500
And I think they now make that one with 
a higher power.

80
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,570
It's that size,
but it's.

81
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,860
And it fits in your hand square and that
the edges are hard.

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,010
Fits in there.
Perfect.

83
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:28,240
Yeah.
It's not like a slip.

84
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,074
This one feels like it's going to slip 
out and you can't quite get around it 

85
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,810
the whole time.
For one.

86
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,670
That one.
It also has a headphone Jack.

87
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,820
It's like the last of the Mohicans.
They got rid of all of it.

88
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,661
Oh No.
Yeah,

89
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,210
I guess it's still know the.
There's the converter.

90
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,030
I Dunno the Dongle.
Is that what it is?

91
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,490
They fucking,
they got me though.

92
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm in,
I'm in.

93
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,440
I haven't used a non apple product and a
long time.

94
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,010
Well,
I gotta think like I was sad and I,

95
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,853
like I said,
and I also got the Samsung Galaxy note 

96
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,590
nine,
the new one and it's very good.

97
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,750
Fucking phone's better.
Damn it.

98
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,200
I wish it wasn't.
Yeah,

99
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,400
I wish it wasn't.
Yeah,

100
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:10,930
man,
they figured it out.

101
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:11,764
They figured some shit out.
It's also just like if they figured out 

102
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:15,490
the lifestyle of something where you're 
like,

103
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,350
I'll take this branding.
I'm a creative,

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,990
I think.
Different.

105
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,300
Yeah.
Fuckers fucking work,

106
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:23,290
man.
I was like,

107
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,153
oh,
because I remember used to getting like 

108
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:26,380
that apple,
the Mac book pro and be like,

109
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,150
I'm going to edit fucking.
I'm going to start editing mode.

110
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,111
Shit.
Well,

111
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:32,944
I remember hearing that Louis was 
editing his show with a 13 inch Mac 

112
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:37,720
book.

113
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,850
He edited his whole show.
Yeah,

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,833
and he liked doing it on the little Mac 
book for some stranger on a plane or 

115
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:44,980
doing whatever.
I get A.

116
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,700
I never edited anything I could never 
fucking.

117
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,870
Do you ever do it?
Does your brain work that way?

118
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:51,700
There you good luck with a manual and 
shit.

119
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:53,260
I feel like your brain works that way a 
little bit.

120
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:54,580
No,
I mean I could,

121
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,683
I just don't have any desire.
It's like your brain has this at some 

122
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:00,034
point decided like my,
I have a certain amount of capacity in 

123
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:05,650
my brain and I don't want to use any of 
that for anything that I don't,

124
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:06,484
I'm not interested in.
It's a good point and sometimes some 

125
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,170
people like that stuff.
It's just like,

126
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:11,004
it's,
I've never been drawn to anything like 

127
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:12,604
that and I'm just not interested.
Like as soon as I could have someone 

128
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:17,320
else like do my taxes,
I was like,

129
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,880
Yup,
I don't want to think about that.

130
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,290
Yeah,
I don't want to do it.

131
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,850
It's all about bandwidth,
right?

132
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,840
Yeah.
Like what,

133
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,560
what are you spending your thinking on?
You could do all those other things,

134
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,840
but how much would that be?
Annoying.

135
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,880
Yeah.
And how much would it fuck up the things

136
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,550
that you liked to do and some people 
love that stuff.

137
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:34,384
Like I have a buddy,
I have a buddy who's a successful actor 

138
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,460
who still does his own taxes,
pays his right side,

139
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:41,230
his own residual checks.
He,

140
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,170
he fucking,
he likes it get.

141
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,290
You know what I mean?
I'm like,

142
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,550
all right,
well good for you.

143
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:48,370
Like in Judah.
That's joyful.

144
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,590
That brings you joy.
This doesn't have to worry about getting

145
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:51,430
ripped off.
That's.

146
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:53,650
I think that's part of it.
Chuck Palahniuk was here.

147
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,370
His agents stole all of his money.
No.

148
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,420
Yeah,
millions real that he's broke.

149
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,690
It's crazy.
How and what happened to the.

150
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,830
Is he going after the fuck it ain't 
going to jail.

151
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,710
Yeah.
Fuck guys stole millions.

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,750
Stole millions from him and a bunch of 
other people.

153
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,750
They don't know where the money is.
He's hoping to get some of it back.

154
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:12,584
They might be able to find some of it,
but the agents stole from several 

155
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:15,854
different clients.
Although I just saw some madman and 

156
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,080
chuck writes books about like,
watch out.

157
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,990
Yeah.
He writes books about creepy people.

158
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,300
Creepy Shit.
Someone did it to him.

159
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,010
Fuck yeah.
Dean's brother and his brother stole his

160
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:31,611
money,
right?

161
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:35,240
I think it's his half brother.
Half brother stole $7,000,000

162
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,580
and wouldn't tell anybody where it is 
still.

163
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:38,900
Fuck you.
I'm going to jail.

164
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,450
Yeah.
And I think he might be out.

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,440
I think he might be out of jail.
Is He looking for new clients?

166
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,363
I think uh,
I think you like put it in coffee cans 

167
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:51,650
and shit and drove across the country 
and worried it holes.

168
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,750
Yeah.
I mean if you have a,

169
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,020
they will be able to find it if they got
a hold of your gps unit.

170
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,640
But if you got like a Garmin gps unit 
that people use,

171
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:00,474
usually they go hiking.
You can need a mark where your campus 

172
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:03,524
but you could,
you could do some low like Geo tagging 

173
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,320
you shit.
You could totally do that.

174
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:07,154
You could go to the fucking woods and go
to a tree and dig a hole next to that 

175
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:14,270
tree deep into the ground,
drop a coffee can with a million dollars

176
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:15,104
in it,
got a tag on it and come back to I keep 

177
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,350
going to coffee.
Can,

178
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,850
I dunno.
Well there's something about.

179
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,713
Yeah,
there's something about a coffee can 

180
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:24,440
that's very pleasing and the idea of 
like rolls of money and like,

181
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,200
yeah.
And like chock full of nuts or whatever.

182
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:29,120
That coffee is like a folgers crystals.

183
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,410
Yeah.
He was probably garbage bags.

184
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,590
You know,
Fargo was just on the other day and it's

185
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:35,080
like,
Buscemi Haydn,

186
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,320
that money,
and then he like,

187
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,790
he's like,
he,

188
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,683
he,
he takes it like he's got his window 

189
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:40,484
scraper and he's in the far,
it's just like desolate snow for miles 

190
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,080
and he just,
he sticks the,

191
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,943
like the window scraper into the snow to
mark where he's hitting the money and 

192
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:52,311
it's like,
oh,

193
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:53,930
this guy's fucked.
He's never getting that money.

194
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,790
Like there's no horizon line.
It's just snow and fucking sky's groups.

195
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,740
You ever watched the new version of it 
with billy?

196
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,450
Bob Thornton is good.
I heard it's great.

197
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:06,190
Season One's good.
Season two is I think for my money,

198
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,183
the best television,
like season two of that show is 

199
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,100
unbelievable.
And season three is very good.

200
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:18,101
But season two is unfucking believable.
It's like in the seventies who's in it?

201
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,760
A Kirson Dunson it.

202
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,260
But like Jesse Plemons,
Kiersten,

203
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:24,540
dawn's,
uh,

204
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,110
who's the fucking,
uh,

205
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,340
I don't even remember,
but it's great.

206
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,760
It's great.
I like that.

207
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:30,594
I like all three seasons of that show,
but season two to me is like 

208
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,973
unstoppable.
Are they still making it or are they 

209
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:38,300
done?
They might go make some more in a few in

210
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,860
a year or two.
I think they might.

211
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:40,694
They were talking about making one.
I think Chris Rock might be attached to 

212
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:44,781
do.
Oh,

213
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:46,010
that's right.
Yeah,

214
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:48,740
I saw something like that.
I saw something like that,

215
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:50,960
but I don't know.
I don't know what the deal is with it,

216
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:54,950
but in season three is great,
but season two is fucking home cooks.

217
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,190
Half brother and sister

218
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,023
in law must repay $12 million.
Is this new list from 2010 when it 

219
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:01,140
happened?
I got.

220
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,630
He got six years in jail in 16 years 
probation.

221
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:08,631
So He'd be out by now.
So He's six years in the pokey in 2010.

222
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:10,194
Yeah.
He's.

223
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,153
I think he just got out dude,
because I remember seeing something 

224
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:15,960
about $10,000,000
was stolen from him.

225
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,540
Fuck.
Must Repay.

226
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,560
Okay.
I don't have it.

227
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,090
Yeah.
What do you do?

228
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,450
How does that work for them in jail?
I mean the guy just stayed in jail,

229
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,930
like he could have a parent that's just.
I might be getting this wrong,

230
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,973
but I do remember some of the story was 
that they were offering leniency if it 

231
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:33,680
gave some of the money back.
It's like,

232
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,130
man,
fuck it,

233
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,110
man.
I'm not going to give it back.

234
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,790
Case like that,
much older cold.

235
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,780
What's that?
Some guy that found a bunch of gold,

236
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,763
he's in jail because he won't tell them 
where it is and he knows people like 

237
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,393
arguably hundreds of millions of dollars
or something like that because of how 

238
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:48,090
much it's worth,
but he found the goal.

239
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,430
He like,
he found the golden.

240
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,620
Then he got investors to give him the 
money to help them go to go retrieve it.

241
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,940
Oh,
he got it.

242
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:54,611
He was like,
ah,

243
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:55,740
I don't know where it is.
Oh,

244
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:57,250
is it like a shipwreck deal?
Yeah.

245
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,330
Yeah.
There's a lot of money in shipwrecks.

246
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,313
I was watching a documentary on these 
billionaires are rich folks rather who 

247
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:09,270
finance these guys to go hunting for 
treasure.

248
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,793
There's.
They know where some Roman ships have 

249
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,034
sunk and so they go looking for these 
Spanish galleons and Roman ship filled 

250
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:22,830
with gold coins that are worth hundreds 
of millions of dollars and you know,

251
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,810
it's like this crazy gamble because the 
ocean's fucking gigantic.

252
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,120
Yeah.
And also like,

253
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:32,860
I guess gold is gold maintain its 
substance after it really does.

254
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,753
Yeah.
I guess why go earlier this grill of 

255
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:37,590
shipwrecks?
17 billion.

256
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,750
$17.
Billion in gold.

257
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:40,470
They found it.
Yeah.

258
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,890
Some of the Massachusetts finds a 
shipwreck with a treasure of up to,

259
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,660
oh my God.
Seventeen billion and so.

260
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:51,150
And someone financed it.
Icon.

261
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,570
No,
that's fucking wild man.

262
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,471
So,
um,

263
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:58,640
where is this fucking in Cape Cod?
God Damn.

264
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:00,300
300.
Ten year old ship Spanish ship.

265
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,910
Wow.
That's amazing.

266
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,410
Yeah.
There was a bunch of those.

267
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,483
I mean,
you imagine taking a fucking boat that 

268
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:10,440
you made out of trees,
filling it up with them.

269
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,713
I try to float it across the fucking 
ocean with like a map that some fucking 

270
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,910
drunk dude had no knowledge at all about
storms come and like I hope we don't get

271
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:22,594
hit by one will fuck knows you've got a 
farmer's Almanac that all the time I 

272
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:26,614
just think about a letter.
I just think about like families like 

273
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,180
immigrants coming over to this country 
and like,

274
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,160
you know,
wherever fucking Ireland,

275
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:34,180
Poland,
Russia,

276
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:36,720
whatever you want to say like turn of 
the 19th,

277
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,530
20th century,
whatever.

278
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,380
Hundreds of years ago.
People get over here and they're like,

279
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,520
I made it.
Okay.

280
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:44,770
I went to New York and now I'm in 
Rochester.

281
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,723
Wherever the fuck I ended up and then 
they have to send a letter that 

282
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:53,191
hopefully goes back across the ocean and
then to like some fucking

283
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,090
mailman who's drunk and dies of a heart 
attack in the mud in Poland.

284
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,060
And you're like,
you hope it gets to you to be like,

285
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:01,721
yeah,
okay.

286
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,340
I'll go meet you in Rochester.
Like I'm,

287
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,303
I'm blown away that anybody cotton in 
touch with anybody and found their 

288
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,530
family or what you would think you would
make a duplicate letters I guess,

289
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:16,120
so that,
that has to be a right.

290
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:17,800
They just were like,
I don't know if you've got the last one,

291
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,270
but heads up.
Um,

292
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,470
um,
you know,

293
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,483
maybe I'm a fucking slave in Rochester,
but I mean imagine the patience that 

294
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:25,924
people have back then because like,
I'll get an email from someone and then 

295
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:31,740
I'll get an email like an hour later.
Did you get that email?

296
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,400
Like Jesus Christ,
Bro,

297
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,280
relax.
That was just like I was,

298
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,070
I was recounting,
I saw a buddy of mine who I'd been,

299
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,200
I'd met and we were in Europe and we and
we met these kids in October fest.

300
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,250
They lived in Germany and we were like 
meeting up with them in October fest and

301
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:50,740
this was before email and cell phones 
and you just were like,

302
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,410
I'm going to be at the fucking to 10 
train in Munich.

303
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,170
Like I hope you're there.
And that was it.

304
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,033
That was like,
you hoped that you connected and that 

305
00:12:58,691 --> 00:12:59,860
was that.
There was no like,

306
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,970
Hey,
I'm texting,

307
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:01,804
I'm five minutes late,
or like I'm emailing you to let you 

308
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:03,874
know,
we'll meet at that Mcdonald's or 

309
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:06,490
whatever the fuck it was.
It was crazy.

310
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,270
Yeah.
So it's amazing that anything got done.

311
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,910
Yeah.
That people met and got married,

312
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,773
had kids and yeah.
And then they traveled across the world 

313
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:19,240
and then came back a month later and 
found their family.

314
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,810
People were waiting for them.
Yeah.

315
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,210
And they did it.
It happened at time.

316
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,870
I mean,
and maybe it's shit didn't have,

317
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,210
I don't know.

318
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,430
I guess like you ever watch the show 
vikings?

319
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,280
No,
it's a good show who,

320
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,123
one of the things that's crazy as these 
motherfuckers would get on boats and 

321
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:37,381
they'd go just row across the ocean,
kill a bunch of people and come back six

322
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:38,734
months later with some goals and 
everybody be waiting for him at the 

323
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:41,800
docks.
That's like,

324
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:43,010
what kind of life is this?
Yeah,

325
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,530
just waiting in the doctor's just like,
there's no version of like,

326
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,990
Fyi,
we'll be there.

327
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,840
Like,
it's not even like you're going to sit.

328
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,430
We'll just send the motorboat ahead to 
like let everybody know that we're going

329
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,260
to be there in like a month.
That's it.

330
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,423
We're gonna.
People are gonna one day laugh at how 

331
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:59,830
ridiculous it is to send a text message.
Like these guys weren't even telepathic.

332
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,210
Could you imagine they had a text each 
other,

333
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:03,044
right?
They to send pictures because they 

334
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:05,860
couldn't see what the other person was 
actually seeing.

335
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,863
It's at all.
It's just going to be all in a fucking 

336
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,560
contact lens.
Is that what's going to happen?

337
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,423
You just can't have a chip.
It's going to be a chip like Black 

338
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,610
Mirror for sure.
Yeah.

339
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:18,640
How far off do you think?
Twenty Years Max?

340
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,680
Yeah.
I think it's going to happen so quick.

341
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,480
Just like cell phones happened so quick 
that the iphone was only 11 years ago.

342
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:27,490
Yeah,
that's crazy.

343
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,900
And I pick the first iphone had a camp.
Did it have a camera on the first side,

344
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:32,734
but maybe it had something.
If you go back and look at your iphone 

345
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:38,350
pictures from like five years ago,
how dare you.

346
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,190
How dare you accept this as a fucking 
photo?

347
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,420
I bought an apple digital camera and it 
was a giant hunk of shit.

348
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,450
It was like this big and it was one 
megapixel.

349
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,040
It was fucking gigantic.
It was

350
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,800
so big.

351
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,090
Yeah,
it was just a brick.

352
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,013
I remember going and buying that first,
like a video camera early two thousands 

353
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:01,960
to like put myself on tape in New York.
Oh,

354
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:03,680
you can hear the,
you can hear the.

355
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,770
And I would try to shoot myself to try 
to get a,

356
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,510
you know,
there it is.

357
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,420
That's what I had was things.
And that's.

358
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,280
And is one second pixel and it was 
probably like $2,000

359
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,690
probably.
Yeah.

360
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:23,170
And before that,
when I first came out here in 1994,

361
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,253
uh,
I had a meeting with this guy who was 

362
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:30,511
like one of the big wigs at Disney and 
he had a newton.

363
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,713
Do you remember?
It was like a tablet and he was all so 

364
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,050
happy about this.
He had,

365
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,720
although very organized on is Newton.
He's like this fucking.

366
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,110
It was like a,
he had a thesaurus with a screen.

367
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,480
That's what it looked like,
this big stupid fucking thing.

368
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,820
And it had,
you know,

369
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,840
a little stylists and things on,
it was

370
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,170
in the years like between when jobs had 
gotten fired and they were like,

371
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,920
or was he still there?
That was,

372
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,230
I think that was when the last years.
I just saw A.

373
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,680
Alan Alda just posted a thing on his old
Atari commercials.

374
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,840
I guess he was the spokesman for Atari 
and uh,

375
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:13,130
tim talking about our,
you could also use for word processing.

376
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,430
And then also that they had like a very 
early tablet.

377
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:17,990
He's like,
you can draw and paint on it.

378
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:18,591
And I was like,
shit,

379
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:21,050
that's bad man.
This is like 84.

380
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,123
Wow.

381
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,100
Which I'm like,
I don't know what that was,

382
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:24,934
but it was Atari,
early Atari Shit you could paint and 

383
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:27,364
draw and.

384
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,120
Well they're the things that they can do
now.

385
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,490
There's these new.
Oh there's Alamogordo,

386
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,950
but loving it,
it was no big deal to use.

387
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,940
I love that voice computer.
Yet people new things.

388
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,550
Terry's going to a lot of trouble to 
make it easier for you.

389
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,730
It comes with the phone.
Yeah.

390
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,561
No.
Well,

391
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:53,780
it's also funny because like back then 
in the eighties,

392
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,623
like he looks young,
but he also sort of looks like how like 

393
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,520
it was like he's 40.
Yeah.

394
00:16:58,521 --> 00:16:59,354
Is that what it is?

395
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,970
Yeah,
but he's probably not forties,

396
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,490
probably 30,
but he looks 40.

397
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,530
People used to a little bit older.
Yeah.

398
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:05,364
That's shit.
Nutrition and bad vitamins and the 

399
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,250
doctors didn't know anything.

400
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:12,160
Yeah.
And like any sort of gray,

401
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,600
you don't know what it,
you know,

402
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,550
exercise well he's.
Although,

403
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:17,260
yeah,
those guys,

404
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,340
it is crazy.
It's also,

405
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:20,610
you look at old movies and you're like,
they're like,

406
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,850
it's an old old movies where you're like
cary grant or something.

407
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,820
You're like,
he's playing like the young bachelor and

408
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:26,654
he's like,
he looks like fucking 60 and maybe it's 

409
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,563
60 or maybe it's just like he was just 
fucking smoking and drinking and looked 

410
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,160
like.
But he did not look good.

411
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,710
And you're like,
I'm still a bachelor.

412
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,390
Yeah,
there was no health back then.

413
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,130
No one was healthy.
No Man,

414
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,830
no one took yoga classes or wait.
No,

415
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,500
nobody's crossfit.
There was like,

416
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,220
I'm smoking

417
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,440
light cigarettes today.
We played,

418
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:55,140
uh,
some clips from I'm spartacus.

419
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,880
Oh yeah.
Douglas,

420
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,013
like,
like you think of him as like a Roman 

421
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:04,371
soldier is like a guy who like probably 
never worked out a day in his life.

422
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:08,454
No.
Yeah.

423
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,610
And he's holding,
this looks like plastic sore,

424
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,100
sore.
It looks so that you can tell he's still

425
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,630
just sort of like wanting to bring it 
down.

426
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,340
Yeah.
Those old school bodies,

427
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,620
old school body weight lifters are like,
yeah,

428
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:20,454
he's not is just everything about them.
But I think he was 40 when they made 

429
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:26,430
this movie.
I think we looked it up.

430
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,160
Yeah.
Did you think he was,

431
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,240
is he spoke again?
You never know how old?

432
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,570
How old is he supposed to be here?
Yeah.

433
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,380
You never know.
But he looks old.

434
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,640
Yeah.
He's got that dips below 60.

435
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,843
Look at his arm,
left hand corner that you look at that 

436
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:44,580
now and you're like,
if the rockery made spark is right now,

437
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,680
it would look a little different.

438
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:47,770
Yeah.
Like look at this.

439
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,500
Well he's like thin from cigarettes.
Like that's the extent of a workout.

440
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,190
Slow everything.
I know,

441
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,911
I know.
Shit.

442
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:57,840
He used to be so,
but it gets.

443
00:18:57,841 --> 00:19:00,060
People didn't care.
He's.

444
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,620
He's Tan though.
10 legs.

445
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,593
Yeah.
Because never done a squat and his 

446
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:05,754
fucking life.
I don't know if they knew what squats 

447
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:09,610
word didn't.
It isn't crazy.

448
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,120
Have you gone back and looked at like 
what fitness?

449
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,090
Like the guys who were into fitness,
like what they were doing?

450
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,800
Yeah.
I mean I don't.

451
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,960
I'm,
I'm genuinely asking.

452
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,710
I'm like,
I don't know what they were doing for.

453
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,440
They were just like fucking eating eggs,
I'm assuming.

454
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,450
Well,
it was just very few of them.

455
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,343
There's bodybuilders back then,
but the numbers were so minuscule in 

456
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:32,040
comparison to people today.
Like you can go to any gym today,

457
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,093
like you'd go to equinox and it's filled
with Jack people and women with giant 

458
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,340
butts guys.

459
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,780
A big chest.
See that's all real shit.

460
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:43,770
That's a great workout right there.
Hanging from those bars and doing push.

461
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,830
They're still doing like they're doing 
some circuit training shit right there.

462
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:47,664
Right.
But they're.

463
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,983
Yeah,
but they're.

464
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,690
These are like high school kids though.
Yeah.

465
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,650
This looks like.
Yeah.

466
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:56,100
They look very young.
That's all legit.

467
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,260
Yeah.
But how old were they?

468
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,410
There were 18.
There was no one who is 40.

469
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:02,580
Who is doing that?
No,

470
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,443
you go to the gym today.
You'll see guys who were in their 

471
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,750
fifties were jacked.
Yeah,

472
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:08,420
man.
Yeah.

473
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,810
It's a different world.
And look at that.

474
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,400
That looks fun.
Hey Man,

475
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:14,580
I fucking love your show.
This show is hilarious.

476
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,740
Thanks man.
And that the character,

477
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,290
the animation looks like you.
It has your lips and your nose.

478
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,130
It's really weird.
It's like,

479
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,130
it looks like you without looking like 
you.

480
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,080
You know what I'm saying?
They captured it.

481
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,460
Yeah,
it's weird.

482
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,770
It's a.
someone posted.

483
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,660
It was right before the show came out 
this year.

484
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:34,494
Someone was like,
someone posted like Japanese make we 

485
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:38,214
make our cartoons a cuter Americans.
Let's make our characters ugly as 

486
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:45,900
fucking possible.
And it's.

487
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,860
And it's mine.
It's me as it's me as a little kid.

488
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,880
And I was like,
I was like,

489
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,240
that's exactly what I look like because 
it looks like you without looking like,

490
00:20:58,241 --> 00:20:59,490
you know.
Yes.

491
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,540
There is a real gift to that.
When people,

492
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,120
they figured out how to capture the 
perfect caricature.

493
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,640
It's weird that we and we give them,
even when we,

494
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,440
even if it's like we,
we try to,

495
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:09,274
like when we have new characters,
we'll just give them pictures of the 

496
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,590
people that are playing them and just 
let them find that version of them.

497
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,840
Uh,
and even when we don't,

498
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:20,950
we'll give people references because 
there's something about capturing a real

499
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:25,360
person that makes it specific in a way 
that you're like,

500
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,110
wow,
dude,

501
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,240
everybody can draw just like draw 
whoever,

502
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:29,074
which does work,
but still there's something about like 

503
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:33,190
being like now we want to guy,
it looks like Rogan.

504
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,023
Like they'll,
they'll get that essence that create 

505
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:38,590
something that feels more real.
It's so weird,

506
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,933
but they're great.
We have a killer team of people 

507
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,070
designing all those characters.
What I love about your show is,

508
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,080
well,
I like a lot of things about it,

509
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:47,914
but one of the things that I love about 
is that you really can only do that on 

510
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:52,360
Netflix.
It's just like there's,

511
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:55,250
it's so unharnessed yes.
It's just,

512
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,770
it's just wild and hilarious and there's
no boundaries to it.

513
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,003
That's one of the more amazing things 
about something like Netflix is that 

514
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,040
there's just,
you could do whatever,

515
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,710
you can do whatever.
You can do whatever length you want,

516
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,010
you can do,
you can say whatever you want,

517
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,283
uh,
you have no advertisers who you're 

518
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,220
either supporting or in competition 
with.

519
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,060
So we can mention brands.
They don't really care about that.

520
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,990
They don't care if there's no,
you know,

521
00:22:23,991 --> 00:22:26,440
when you're a network tv,
it's like you got to get an act break,

522
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:28,390
you got the first act has to be eight 
minutes,

523
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:29,500
second act has to be blah,
blah,

524
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:29,801
blah,
blah,

525
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:30,460
blah.

526
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,280
And even when there's,
there's more flexibility now,

527
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:35,830
but they,
but also most importantly,

528
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,740
they just basically let us do whatever 
the fuck we want.

529
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,970
That's amazing.
Yeah.

530
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,193
They,
they've been very good partners 

531
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:45,280
creatively,
if you just stand up special with them.

532
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,653
No.
I did one special years ago for comedy 

533
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:50,000
central.
You just did.

534
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,270
You're just came out.
How was,

535
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,920
how was,
how was the experience?

536
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,450
It was,
what does the second one?

537
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,440
Well,
I've done three with them.

538
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,260
I did one with them in 2005 a long time 
ago.

539
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,290
Way Back in the day and then I did one 
two years ago in this.

540
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,160
They're fucking amazing.
You don't bother you at all?

541
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,450
No.
They just leave you on.

542
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:08,290
They go.
You're funny.

543
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,880
You want to do a special.
Yeah.

544
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:10,714
Okay,
go ahead.

545
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,643
Yeah.
That's kind of the thing and they're 

546
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:12,904
just like,
you've proven that you can do your 

547
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:14,680
thing.

548
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,510
We're not going to get in the way.
And I think they realize like,

549
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,560
oh,
we don't get in the way.

550
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:21,670
We just have less work to do and if they
find someone like you,

551
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,330
that is a funny guy,
they just,

552
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,770
they know you're going to try your best.
Yeah.

553
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,880
Yeah.
Like you're funny.

554
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,970
You're going to want to.
Generally it's not a money grab.

555
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,680
Yeah.
I mean it's like you want to go,

556
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,840
you want to go fucking do it and do it 
well and you know that everybody's gonna

557
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,703
see it.
That's the thing with them right now is 

558
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:41,230
you're like,
I don't know about you,

559
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:42,064
but it's like I just want,
if I'm going to spend a lot of time 

560
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:45,664
making something,
I want the most amount of possible 

561
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,070
eyeballs that I can get and that's what 
they do.

562
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,960
Well,
especially for a comedy special,

563
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,760
there's really no other game in town.

564
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,803
I mean,
I've had friends that did something on 

565
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:00,140
Hbo and I'm like,
Oh yeah,

566
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,610
yeah,
yeah.

567
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,930
And if it doesn't,
if you don't see it that night,

568
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,820
right.
There's some streaming services.

569
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,730
I'm known as hbo go,
but I would love to see the numbers.

570
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,743
I'd be cured.
Many people are actually using those 

571
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:13,874
things.
I would love to see the numbers across 

572
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:15,740
the board,
but it is now.

573
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:17,750
It just feels like we were.
Because we went out,

574
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,643
we went out wide with the show.
We had a couple of different offers and 

575
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,580
Netflix just seemed like the place where
it's like they work at a creatively fuck

576
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:26,414
with us and they were and everyone was 
going to have a chance to see it and we 

577
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,570
were going to get like kids,
like we're going to get anyone,

578
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,340
like we have like 13 year old,
12,

579
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:36,690
13 year old kids watching the show.
Whoa.

580
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,350
Which,
which is,

581
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,920
which is crazy.
Yeah.

582
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,320
Cause this fucking dirty.
Yeah.

583
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,620
It gets pretty dirty.
Yeah.

584
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,960
I'd love that.
The masturbation demon,

585
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,210
the hormone monster.

586
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,770
Is that your voice?
Oh yeah,

587
00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:51,200
yeah,
yeah,

588
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,600
that's fine.
My Andrew was like,

589
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,920
my partners on an Andrew Goldberg,
Mark Levin and Jen up were like,

590
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,010
they were talking about it because mark 
and Jen have a kid who's was around that

591
00:25:01,011 --> 00:25:01,844
age when we started doing it,
they were just talking about hormones 

592
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,740
and all that shit and they're like,
we should have a hormone monster.

593
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:07,574
And then they were like,
yeah,

594
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,060
it should just be a hormone monster.
And then Andrew called me.

595
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:11,894
It was like we're thinking about doing 
like a hormone monster and I just 

596
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:15,510
immediately was just like you,
Sylvia,

597
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,630
Andrea,
and it just became.

598
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,201
It was like,
okay,

599
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:19,170
got it.
Alright,

600
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,023
we got him.
We got him fucking locked down and it 

601
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:24,440
is.
I mean we have those.

602
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,810
We all have those things.
You know,

603
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,330
sometimes they get integrated,
sometimes they don't.

604
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,283
Well it's,
I just love that you just like what you 

605
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:37,310
see in south park and what you see in a 
bill burroughs show F is for family,

606
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,420
does things.

607
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:43,420
You can do an animated show that are 
physically impossible in any other form.

608
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,600
And it's amazing.
Yeah.

609
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,630
It's an amazing format especially for.
I think for us,

610
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:53,720
like for if you're a.
especially if you're like a comedy brain

611
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,080
that doesn't necessarily come straight 
out of like classic Sitcom writing,

612
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,733
that what you have other weird ways of 
getting into something and you want to 

613
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:07,400
be able to personify it and like 
animation just allows you to do it.

614
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:08,234
It also allows you to fucking have a.
like you couldn't do live action stuff 

615
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:14,390
with the kids,
with kids the way we have where you just

616
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:16,760
like,
it's just too uncomfortable but.

617
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,000
But you see it an animation and you can 
get away,

618
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,401
be like,
all right,

619
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:20,234
let's have the statue of Liberty,
talk to that girl and let's have this 

620
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:26,681
hormone monster and this season it would
be unethical if you had children,

621
00:26:26,691 --> 00:26:28,460
actors.
I've ever worked with kid actors.

622
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,570
You a little bit.
Yeah.

623
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,423
I only did it once.
I did a show called hardball and there 

624
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:33,734
was a little kid.
It was like a bat boy and the girl was 

625
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:38,540
on the show and they were both like 
early teens,

626
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,790
like 13,
14 and it was weird.

627
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,070
I felt weird because everyone else's 
adults

628
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,080
and they would swear and say fucked up 
thing.

629
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:48,270
You have to look over your shoulder so 
you have the kids around.

630
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,770
Can you say something crazy?

631
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,823
I had to deal with a kid.
I was on the show called the league and 

632
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:53,914
we had A.
I had a son on the show who was aged up 

633
00:26:57,011 --> 00:26:59,100
every year,
but by the last seasons,

634
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:00,540
four or five,
he was like,

635
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,713
from like seven to like nine and it was 
crazy because we were doing some crazy 

636
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:11,140
shit and there's a scene where he's like
eating ice chips out of a urinal,

637
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,310
urinal cookies or something like that.
It was like.

638
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,100
And it was fun.
It was a clean,

639
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,020
you know,
we made sure it was all good,

640
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:24,220
but still unlike we had him doing some 
fucked up shit.

641
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,630
And you're like,
all right.

642
00:27:25,631 --> 00:27:27,730
And the mom was there.
The mom was cool with all of it,

643
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:28,564
but it was like,
it wasn't just like even a sitcom or 

644
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:30,401
it's like,
oh,

645
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:31,234
we're going to have a little,
maybe someone on set saying something 

646
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:33,844
weird,
like we're adding this kid doing some 

647
00:27:34,481 --> 00:27:35,740
weird shit.
And it was like,

648
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,450
okay,
I hope this is all right.

649
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,430
What year did you get into show 
business?

650
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,260
Uh,
how old was I?

651
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:44,020
Or like I was like 20.
I graduated,

652
00:27:44,021 --> 00:27:46,300
started doing open mics,
like Oh,

653
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,920
two.
I was 23.

654
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:48,520
Twenty four.

655
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,600
Yeah,
that's good year.

656
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,170
That's a perfect year.
You're,

657
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,850
you're a young adult or young adult.
What about you?

658
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,090
I was 21.
Yeah.

659
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,050
Young adults.

660
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,480
Yeah.
Which I was like,

661
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,950
and it took a while to like get it all 
rolling.

662
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,900
But it was,
it was.

663
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:04,480
I do think the early.
I mean I,

664
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,740
there are a few people who seem to start
young who were.

665
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:06,880
Okay.

666
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,150
Okay.
Um,

667
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,840
but it's tough man.
I've never met one.

668
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,430
Yeah,
they're all crazy.

669
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,060
Have you met Seth Rogen at all?
Have you dealt with seth rogen with seth

670
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:16,894
when he.
He was on freaks and Geeks when he was 

671
00:28:18,521 --> 00:28:21,130
like 16.
Maybe.

672
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:21,964
That was the cutoff age.
That's the age where you could pull it 

673
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,150
off.
Yeah,

674
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,140
because you have enough awkward,
uncomfortable.

675
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,260
Actual years.
Yeah.

676
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,143
Adult.
He also had like a few years on that 

677
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:35,190
show and then that show got canceled and
he liked,

678
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:38,650
didn't have much of a,
like there were a few lean years.

679
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,623
They're good for you?
I think it made him a regular human 

680
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:43,114
being because I'm trying to think.
There were no kids on newsradio right 

681
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:48,340
there right now.
Were there any lifetime there?

682
00:28:48,341 --> 00:28:50,620
Were there like a act?
They're.

683
00:28:50,621 --> 00:28:51,431
No,
they're all,

684
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:52,264
they're all,
all

685
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,030
adults.
All adults.

686
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:57,360
Except Andy Dick and just whatever he 
is.

687
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,680
Yeah.
Have you had him on recent years?

688
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,450
Yeah,
I had,

689
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,283
um,
one once.

690
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,420
That's enough.
Yeah.

691
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,690
Yeah.
Random him at the comedy store the other

692
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:07,320
day.
He will not the other day.

693
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:08,410
He's not,
he's banned now.

694
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,080
Is he abandoned yet?
He uh,

695
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,840
he licked earl skakel his face and he 
just,

696
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,733
he would,
there's drunk andy and when drunk 

697
00:29:16,111 --> 00:29:18,520
candies around you just gotta get the 
fuck out of there,

698
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,060
you know,
you can tell the difference.

699
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:21,900
It's two different guys.
Very aggressive.

700
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,900
Gets like bags in the car window and 
you're like,

701
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,380
oh no,
it's drunk candy.

702
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,560
Yeah.
And sober.

703
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:30,510
And he's a fucking sweetheart.
Wonderful Guy.

704
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,240
And so funny man,
he's a hilarious guy.

705
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:34,074
We,
we did scenes together where we had to 

706
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:36,204
do the take five,
six times because I couldn't stay 

707
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:40,680
straight.
I kept cracking you while your kids stay

708
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:41,514
straight with Andy.

709
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,980
But he is,
he is,

710
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,480
he's so funny.
But I had,

711
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,900
I did a,
I did a early.

712
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:53,530
One of my first things I did have like a
voice on American dad and I did.

713
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,700
They had me do Andy Dick and I was so 
psyched to get a Gig.

714
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,750
You know what I mean?
I was like,

715
00:29:58,751 --> 00:29:59,584
I'm not.
My favorite thing is not doing other 

716
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:01,354
comedians.
Like there's some weird kind of code 

717
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:04,660
that I don't know what.
Yeah.

718
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,850
And you know what I mean.
Did you feel like a Dick?

719
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:08,950
I try not to talk shit about comedian.
It just,

720
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:11,620
it's like,
I don't know why it's like I did it.

721
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,180
It was one of my first gigs.
It was like,

722
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,830
oh cool.
I got to be on American Dad.

723
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,010
I did Andy Dick.
It was looking back.

724
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:21,220
I would not probably do it now where you
know,

725
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,360
you just do it over the top.

726
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,080
I don't know,
I just didn't know what I mean.

727
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,340
Isn't andy kind of over the top as easy?
You know what I mean?

728
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:28,000
Like,
yeah,

729
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,480
I did not mean it was not been like I'm 
going to go fucking get Andy Dick.

730
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,790
But anyway,
when I saw him,

731
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,743
when I.
Since then I've seen him over the years 

732
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,290
and,
and I liked him and I think he,

733
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,960
when he's sober,
he's like,

734
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,333
you know,
I saw your impression of me and he's 

735
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:46,180
like,
and he's kind of like,

736
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:47,250
it's funny,
you know,

737
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,400
and then I've seen him drunk and he's 
like sow,

738
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,800
you know,
it's like a very different.

739
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,970
It's a very different version of it and 
I'm like,

740
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,070
but you know,
but I get it,

741
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:00,904
man.
If someone did a fucking impression to 

742
00:31:02,631 --> 00:31:04,400
me on some animated show,
I dunno,

743
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,231
I probably,
I'm like,

744
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:06,670
no,
I'll do the impression of me.

745
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,580
I'll let me,
let me control my narrative here.

746
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:10,743
I think you gotta take your lumps,
I guess edition about you gotTa take 

747
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:16,370
your lumps.
Yeah.

748
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,590
Well,
because then he's done it,

749
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:19,300
you know,
but he'd go back and watch stiller.

750
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:21,040
The stiller show.
He's funny as shit man.

751
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,740
Oh that was a great show.
People forgot about the stiller show.

752
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:27,130
That was a fucking great job.
Him Odin.

753
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:30,260
Kirk Janeane.
Garofalo Stiller Bunch.

754
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,790
I think appetite road out.
There was a crazy group.

755
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,440
What year was that?
That's midnight.

756
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:38,050
And or maybe earlier.
Ninety to 90,

757
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,240
it had to be pre news radio.
I think it was pre.

758
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,850
When does,
when does news radio?

759
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,080
Ninety four.
Did you come out here and get news?

760
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:47,914
Radio?
How old were you going to get news 

761
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:48,770
radio?

762
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,603
20 seven something else.
I was on a show called hardball when I 

763
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:56,720
was 26 and it was canceled.
It was a,

764
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,210
a baseball sitcoms.
Terrible baseball said,

765
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,570
come on Fox.
It's the one where I did with the little

766
00:32:02,571 --> 00:32:02,930
kid.
Yeah,

767
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,530
yeah,
yeah.

768
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,310
But uh,
that,

769
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,910
that did like six episodes and they got 
canceled and I was ready to move back to

770
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:09,500
New York.
I hated it out here.

771
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,320
But uh,
I got a lease on an apartment.

772
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,590
I had to stay here for a year.
Like I have this place.

773
00:32:15,591 --> 00:32:17,900
I bought a couch,
I bought a TV.

774
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,540
Well I got a stereo goes,
man,

775
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,600
I remember how I got a stereo.
You like,

776
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:27,840
this is a six CD changer.
I'm not about to fucking move across the

777
00:32:27,841 --> 00:32:30,480
country anywhere.
You remember that there was like,

778
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,343
oh,
you could put so many cds as fucking 

779
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,400
thing.
You have people over and we'd go random.

780
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:40,070
Anya do random felt like a boss.
Then there were people

781
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,180
that had like hundred CD changers.
Tower.

782
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:46,270
Yeah.
Stack the tower with OCD.

783
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,863
I just opened up my eyes,
just opened up my cabinet with all my 

784
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:51,164
dvds and like all that shit,
which I haven't looked at and I haven't 

785
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:58,910
looked at it and like five,
six years I still have a stack of them.

786
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,020
Vhs tapes that I won't throw A.
Yeah,

787
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,900
there's some of them that I dislike.
I don't think I can get this anywhere.

788
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,920
Do you still have a vhs player?
Yes.

789
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,200
Really?
Yeah.

790
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,510
Yeah.
Whoa.

791
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,730
I haven't even touched it.
I'm curious.

792
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:13,560
Five years.
I haven't even touched it.

793
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,820
Have you gone back and did you have your
camera?

794
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:20,080
I just went back and digitize a bunch of
like stuff that I shot on like a,

795
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,550
you know,
my little dv

796
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,370
stuff.
You know what?

797
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:25,650
I haven't done that and I don't even 
know Gunna.

798
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,810
I just feel like,
like let it all go,

799
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:34,260
let it go.
I feel that way with your inclined to do

800
00:33:34,261 --> 00:33:35,094
that today because everything is.
Everyone's taking photos of everything 

801
00:33:39,181 --> 00:33:40,014
and video of everything and I just feel 
I don't have time to look at them like 

802
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,740
if I went and looked into my iphone from
like seven,

803
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:47,574
eight years ago,
just started going through all the 

804
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:52,350
pictures of the only thing I keep his 
photos of my kids keep those.

805
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,050
I keep photos of your kids to.
Thank you.

806
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,430
That's very kind of you.
I'll go to you if I need backup.

807
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,090
Yeah,
you got it.

808
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,230
Other than that,
that's it.

809
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,340
Yeah.
Just like,

810
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,203
what am I going to do?

811
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,380
Well,
it's like we're,

812
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,830
I feel like we're in A.
I feel like I have a gold fish brain.

813
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:10,330
Like I feel like I just like swim and 
five minutes later it's gone.

814
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,383
You know what I mean?
And I feel like I am constantly in that 

815
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:18,850
space and I feel like we record all this
shit and then we don't really look back.

816
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:20,980
Maybe some people look back,
but I'm the same way.

817
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
I think we're inundated.
We're over

818
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,053
run by information.
I don't think our brains are even 

819
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,160
remotely capable of processing the 
amount of raw data that comes to you and

820
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,293
have you checked your google news feed,
then you check your twitter feed and 

821
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:39,570
then people send me things in email and 
I check those out.

822
00:34:39,571 --> 00:34:40,470
I don't,
I don't have,

823
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,590
I don't have the time or the storage.
It's just,

824
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,850
it goes in and it goes out.

825
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,123
I have.
Well I have,

826
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:49,360
I just was like,
I use the Google App on my phone to like

827
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,050
search it.
Yeah,

828
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,350
me too.
And I'll go on there,

829
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:52,184
but now Google's got like stories they,
it thinks I'm going to be interested in 

830
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,840
and then I'll be like,
oh fuck,

831
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:58,910
I guess I gotta look up whatever's going
on.

832
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,630
And then like 30 minutes later I'm like,
why did I go to Google?

833
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,300
What was,
what was I going in there for?

834
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,750
That's my toilet time.
Yes.

835
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:06,584
I'm taking a dump.
Open that APP up and next thing you 

836
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:09,170
know,
my legs are numb.

837
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,453
Totally.
You're like limping out of the bathroom 

838
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,910
with a weird red emperor in impressions 
on like right above your knee.

839
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:17,803
And it doesn't make any sense.
It's like I didn't get anything out of 

840
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:23,060
that thing.
I feel like if you have discipline,

841
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:25,820
if you could avoid that,
the good stories will come to you.

842
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,920
The ones that you need to hear about,
like,

843
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:29,900
dude,
if you fucking heard about what happened

844
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:30,621
to him,
like,

845
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:31,454
okay,
then you hear it.

846
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,810
Yes it is.
Or because I also,

847
00:35:33,811 --> 00:35:35,120
there was a period of time where I was 
like,

848
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,880
not reading the news.
I was parsing,

849
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,450
I was piecing together the news based 
off of people's twitter jokes,

850
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,760
you know what I mean?
Where I was like,

851
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,920
okay,
I'm going to put the math together.

852
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:48,270
I think like,
you know,

853
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
I think there's been a hurricane 
somewhere.

854
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,390
Um,
but I feel like my downtime,

855
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,560
my pro,
I'm,

856
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,393
I think I'm scared of having actual 
downtime because when I have actual 

857
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:04,500
downtime I spent so much time in some of
my phone that.

858
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,340
And that stresses me out.
So like if I'm working,

859
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:11,610
I don't have time to be looking at my 
phone and then I'm like,

860
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,260
just work,
you know what I mean?

861
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:16,680
But it's,
I'm scared of like downtime.

862
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,300
Yeah.
Downtime,

863
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,560
fallen time,
they are very bad for you.

864
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,830
It's just not healthy.
It's not normal,

865
00:36:23,831 --> 00:36:24,664
it's not a normal interaction.
And if you're like looking at shit that 

866
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,010
you're freaking out about that as I was 
freaking out today about um,

867
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,920
the,
what's going on in Portland,

868
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:33,963
there's all these antifa riots that are 
happening and they're blocking traffic 

869
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,043
and people are trying to drive to their 
job and the Antifa people are telling 

870
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:44,080
them go right,
we're closed the street off and they got

871
00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:44,914
like masks on Shit.
And the Portland mayor apparently not 

872
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:48,424
doing anything about it.
And their stress smash some banging on 

873
00:36:52,301 --> 00:36:54,850
some dude's car because you refused to 
fucking go,

874
00:36:54,851 --> 00:36:55,684
right?
You wanted to go straight through the 

875
00:36:56,621 --> 00:36:57,454
street.
Like they were literally directing 

876
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:00,004
traffic and there's all these videos of 
where people are freaking out because 

877
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:05,710
Portland is just,
it's a great city.

878
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,780
So fun.
So overly progressive that you have this

879
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,210
section of super far left.
Maniacs that are,

880
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,810
that have gathered and I've found a 
cause and now they're,

881
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,673
they've decided that they're going to.
And these are white people screaming 

882
00:37:22,901 --> 00:37:24,120
out,
fuck white people.

883
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,330
The whole thing is so crazy.
It's like totally misguided.

884
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,610
I just want to eat delicious food in 
Portland.

885
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,600
I just want to eat a place to eat like 
fresh food.

886
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,880
It's a good place for comedy too.
It is fun.

887
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,520
It's a great comedy town there.
So yeah,

888
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,583
so the best.

889
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,530
It's just,
you know,

890
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,630
when you get a town of millions of 
people,

891
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,840
you're going to have a fucking few 
thousand assholes.

892
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,250
There's just no way around that.

893
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,133
Yeah,
everywhere I've gone that I find that 

894
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,043
the Pacific northwest is interesting.
Just like I found the homeless vibes in 

895
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:57,710
Portland,
Seattle and San Francisco.

896
00:37:57,711 --> 00:37:58,850
It's intense right now.

897
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,793
You know,
seattle or rather San Francisco has a 

898
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:06,421
new APP that you can locate human shit 
on to alert the health department.

899
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,073
It's like a crap.

900
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,720
I love it.
Only in San Francisco there's like,

901
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,850
it's a startup.
We have a giant problem over there.

902
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,751
Dude.
It's intense,

903
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,930
man.
It's intense.

904
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,720
They got too liberal.
They let two.

905
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,660
They were just too open minded with the 
homeless folks.

906
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,533
Fuck.
These people are just shitting openly 

907
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:26,830
shitting in the gutter.
Look at that.

908
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,843
Here's the poop.

909
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,881
Oh,
I liked that.

910
00:38:28,881 --> 00:38:30,630
The coloring.
I wonder when they discovered,

911
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:33,480
they're like,
we can do varying levels of what is that

912
00:38:33,481 --> 00:38:36,190
area that seems to be covered.
Is it like that downtown

913
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,800
embarcadero or like right off the 
mission and shit.

914
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,860
Fuck,
look how much shit there is.

915
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:46,240
That's the area that is crazy.
Like on all those corners as human shit.

916
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,940
Oh man,
that is correct.

917
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,080
And that's not an exaggeration.
I was there.

918
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,660
My friend Jake put it up on his 
instagram,

919
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:57,690
a guy with his pants down just spraying 
shit out of his ass into the street.

920
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,430
He was standing on the sidewalk after 
this treat.

921
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,503
Just spraying dude.
I mean I do that but that's like I go 

922
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,090
but I do it for art.
It's art,

923
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:08,500
it's my art,
you know what I mean?

924
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:13,330
And it's for leisure kind to do 
something to take public.

925
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:16,120
Have you ever had a public shooting?
I'm not on purpose.

926
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,223
Yeah,
I shit my pants a couple of times 

927
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,293
public,
but I mean I kept it in like inside my 

928
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,260
clothes.
I Shit my pants.

929
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,360
I was thinking about,
I was coming in here being like,

930
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,680
to have any,
like I'm like,

931
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:27,780
I don't do mma,
everything.

932
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,330
I was like,
well,

933
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,250
what did I ever do?
Credit.

934
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:29,701
I was like,
oh,

935
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:33,160
right.
I did karate until I was seven and I did

936
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:34,990
it and I like,
I remember being,

937
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,910
I was in a class with a bunch of,
um,

938
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,200
cops in my town.
They had like a self defense class and I

939
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:43,010
was friends with like a cop and so he 
said,

940
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,520
come take the karate class.
Like,

941
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,270
sure,
we'd go in and take it.

942
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,070
And it was,
and I'm wearing the,

943
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,030
like the gooey and it's fucking,
you know,

944
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:54,280
I was sick so I just kept nodding it,
you know what I mean?

945
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:55,000
You're just like,
oh,

946
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,833
I'm fucking on.
And I kept nodding it and then I go to 

947
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:00,580
class and I'd like I'd eaten fettuccine 
Alfredo.

948
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,990
I was fucking sitting there and I'm 
taking the class,

949
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:08,140
doing my little kicks and then I'm like,
I got to go to the bathroom and I get to

950
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:12,400
the bathroom and I can't untie the too 
many fucking nuts.

951
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,810
And I just,
I'm six.

952
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:18,150
I just fucking spray diarrhea down my 
down,

953
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,993
my geeky and then like go back to class.
Like all these cops are like dirty 

954
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,200
little fuck.
And I was like,

955
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:30,790
I think that's the last time I took 
karate.

956
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,370
That was the end of my mixed martial 
arts career.

957
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,020
Yeah,
that can be a problem.

958
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,080
Have you ever fought so hard that you 
like lose like mayor?

959
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,950
Does that happen?
Like with Michelle?

960
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,080
Yeah,
like marathon.

961
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:43,060
I've done that inside the octagon for 
sure.

962
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,103
Yeah.
There's actually a new rule in some 

963
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:46,414
athletic commissions.
They stop a fight just for hygiene 

964
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,940
concerns.
Someone shits themselves.

965
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,740
Sure.
But it's happened many times.

966
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,873
Yeah,
because you think if you've got an open 

967
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:58,630
wound and you got shit,
there's some real issues.

968
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,870
There's some real duty duty issues 
there.

969
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,723
Real problem and there was,
there was that marathon runner who lost 

970
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,590
her.
Like that's happened a bunch of times.

971
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,410
Apparently marathon runners shit 
themselves all the time.

972
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:14,500
Just keep running.
I see I'm not that.

973
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,520
Are you that way?
Isn't it like you'll push your leg?

974
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,393
I'm like,
I would never push myself to that point 

975
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:19,421
where I'm like,
yeah,

976
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:20,254
I'll push myself to the phone.
Really depends on what it meant to me 

977
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,533
and I mean if I,
if I had some deep emotional reason to 

978
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:29,030
finish this marathon.
Yeah.

979
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,050
Like my dad died or you know what I 
mean?

980
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:34,240
That

981
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,170
Burton are run marathons,
right?

982
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,420
I don't think he's ever run a marathon.
His Dad did.

983
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,753
His Dad ran a marathon.
His Dad is a holocaust survivor in his 

984
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:45,170
eighties and he ran a six hour marathon 
and the.

985
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,283
We were telling Bert,
there's no fucking way you got to beat 

986
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:50,450
or his dad or his dad said,
it's 80.

987
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:51,651
Bert,
you're a fat.

988
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:54,010
Fuck.
Did he beat him by like a half hour?

989
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,920
Burt did it in like five hours on birth 
or his dad was like seventies,

990
00:41:57,921 --> 00:41:59,330
eighties running a marathon,
ladies.

991
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,230
Yeah,
man,

992
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,840
he's 82.
You can survive the Holocaust man.

993
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,810
What's a fucking marathon?
You know what I mean?

994
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,850
Well,
he was also in the Israeli army.

995
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,220
He's an old dude.
Well,

996
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:10,760
yeah,
and,

997
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,050
but you look at our,
you're like,

998
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:13,550
I could see.
It's like there's that.

999
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,450
There's that version of Jus like that 
skinny Jew that can run a marathon,

1000
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,350
like I buy that.

1001
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,230
Yeah,
I could see that.

1002
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,570
Well,
when we started doing this fitness thing

1003
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:24,570
already had,
you know,

1004
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,423
we have the sober October thing and then
there's this fitness challenge attached 

1005
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:28,454
to it and our.
He literally hadn't worked out at all 

1006
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,530
in,
I think he said 10 years.

1007
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,860
I think 10 years ago he was taking 
Jujitsu with me.

1008
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:40,220
That's the last time he did any exercise
at all.

1009
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,600
How did he,
how is he doing?

1010
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,580
He's doing great.
He's in second place right now.

1011
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,730
He's right behind me.
It is a game of genetics on some level.

1012
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,420
It's just a game of will.
Yeah.

1013
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,520
Yeah.
Because this thing,

1014
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:52,460
this thing that we're using,
all it does is measure your heart rate,

1015
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,780
so if you're just willing to keep your 
heart rate elevated and push yourself,

1016
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,920
it just depends on.
Yeah.

1017
00:42:57,921 --> 00:42:58,754
Like what is your level of competition?
And you're like that you want to 

1018
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:01,580
fucking.

1019
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,170
Yeah.
And what is your.

1020
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,870
How strong is your will?
That's really what it is.

1021
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:06,763
Is there anything to it?
If it's like if you have an exercise in 

1022
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:10,610
10 years and you all of a sudden start 
to exercise,

1023
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:12,770
your heart rate goes up naturally 
because it's like,

1024
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:15,680
what the fuck's going on?
We're trying to think that maybe he's so

1025
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:19,220
fucking out of shape that he's just like
walking and his heart rate's been,

1026
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:24,590
but I don't think so.
But see this thing is very flawed.

1027
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,453
This fucking this thing that we have 
because it gives you the same amount of 

1028
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:32,300
points for 80 percent of your heart rate
as it does for 90.

1029
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:33,623
So the first day I was like,
I'm gonna burry these motherfuckers and 

1030
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:39,290
I pegged my heart rate at 90 for like 35
minutes.

1031
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,940
I was like,
I'm just going to leave them in the dust

1032
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,260
like they can't keep up.

1033
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,110
And then I found out that all you have 
to just keep it at 80,

1034
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:47,990
which was like 143 beats per minute,
which is easy.

1035
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,100
You walk and talk,
you'll get the 43 if you.

1036
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,160
If you're on an elliptical machine,
you could have a full on conversation.

1037
00:43:55,161 --> 00:43:57,530
No problem at 143 beats,
right?

1038
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,350
So it's flawed.
It's flawed because the end,

1039
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:02,690
there's that difference between 80 and 
90 percent where you're like,

1040
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:03,524
you're getting that extra burden.
It's the matter of the sheer time you 

1041
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,190
put in.
That's,

1042
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,500
that's what's separating everybody in 
this little challenge at Ari.

1043
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:17,120
We'll put in two and a half hours,
like he will watch a movie and just keep

1044
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:21,830
his heart rate pegged at 100 4,346
beats a minute for two and a half hours.

1045
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:22,664
He wants to fucking beat.
You guys just wants a win and he wants 

1046
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:27,290
and he's been talking mad shit about it.

1047
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,313
I was,
I was,

1048
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,570
I was.
At first I was like,

1049
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:33,060
you know what the context is so fucking.
There's no real.

1050
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,373
Like,
like there's nothing we haven't 

1051
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,680
established.
What happens to the loser,

1052
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:38,993
you know,
we haven't established what the winner 

1053
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:41,530
gets other than a belt.
We have a belt,

1054
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:46,740
her belt,
like a wwe bill getting one made.

1055
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,930
That's so funny,
but it's just,

1056
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:49,764
it doesn't,
that's all just wanting to beat your 

1057
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:51,294
friends.
Yes.

1058
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,980
But,
and for awhile I was like,

1059
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:53,814
fuck,
I'm just going to do my normal workout 

1060
00:44:54,521 --> 00:44:56,890
and if they beat me they beat me.
And then I thought about,

1061
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,260
I was like,
I can't let that happen.

1062
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,873
So I started ramping it up.
I decided over the last couple of days 

1063
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:03,363
that it took three days off too because 
I had to go to vegas and I had to work 

1064
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,250
and then I decided,
uh,

1065
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,210
yesterday I'm going to fuck these guys 
up.

1066
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:11,520
So yesterday and today I've been hitting
it hard.

1067
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,670
I did three and a half hours today.
Yeah.

1068
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:17,010
That's crazy.
Do you feel good?

1069
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,143
Great.
Yeah,

1070
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:18,691
I mean,
I,

1071
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:20,640
yeah.
And physically do you feel different?

1072
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:22,560
Yeah.
Do you do or do not feel different?

1073
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:23,310
Like,
uh,

1074
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,780
being completely sober?
Um,

1075
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,770
well I'm definitely high as fuck from 
all this running.

1076
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,480
Yeah.
There's no doubt about that.

1077
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,000
That's real.
Like runner's high is legit.

1078
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,650
Like if you run for two hours and then a
rock falls in your car from the sky.

1079
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,270
But I guess I lost my car.

1080
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,160
So silly.
It's a.

1081
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:46,050
and I get the same way from Yoga.
Yes.

1082
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,420
Silly.
There's a silliness to you.

1083
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,820
Yeah.
I don't.

1084
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,260
I hate running so much.
I fucking hate it.

1085
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,520
I'd rather go like,
uh,

1086
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:57,030
I started playing soccer again.
Soccer's great.

1087
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:58,680
Yeah.
Which serious?

1088
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:00,540
Aerobics workout.
That's intense.

1089
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:01,374
Like I finished that.
My problem is I turned bright red as 

1090
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:06,300
soon as I do anything with any.
And I'm like the color,

1091
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:08,940
like a deep maroon.
And I'm like,

1092
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,770
but it's great,
but I need,

1093
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,530
I need a game attached to it.
I can't just run.

1094
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,590
That's why Jujitsu is so good for me.
That's what I love about you.

1095
00:46:16,591 --> 00:46:18,930
Just so you're doing something,
you're trying to,

1096
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,793
you know,
you're doing a martial art and it's 

1097
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:25,740
exhausting and you get a great workout 
in while you're having fun.

1098
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,200
Beating the shit out of somebody.
Choking people.

1099
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,250
Yeah.

1100
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,083
Yeah.
Never mind.

1101
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,473
I'm like,
I'll go play soccer and then slightly 

1102
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:34,320
injured myself.
Now I'm like,

1103
00:46:34,321 --> 00:46:36,420
as I'm getting older,
it's like every time I do it,

1104
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,760
I do something.
Fuck up my body.

1105
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:39,990
He definitely can do that.
You know,

1106
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,370
we have here.
That's amazing.

1107
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:42,204
We have this htc vive.
It's a virtual reality headset and 

1108
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:50,121
there's a boxing game.
Put this headset on and you're standing,

1109
00:46:50,131 --> 00:46:52,640
you see boxing gloves in front of you 
and there's a dude in front of you,

1110
00:46:52,641 --> 00:46:53,790
right?
It looks really good.

1111
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:57,540
Throw punches,
and you get that aerobic workout without

1112
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:01,230
pounding her fucking and he hits you.
You see sparks.

1113
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:02,310
Really.
Boom.

1114
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,630
Lucky hit you.
Yeah.

1115
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:06,420
You don't feel anything,
but it makes you nervous.

1116
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:06,841
Like,
damn,

1117
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:07,930
he got me.
Yeah,

1118
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,670
like I've done rounds where you,
you've,

1119
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,600
you fight these people and you get 
exhausted.

1120
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,190
Boxing seems to be crazy.

1121
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,480
Aerobic workout.
It's great.

1122
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:17,640
Yeah.
It's getting hit in the head thing.

1123
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,700
It's fucking terrible for you though.
It's so bad for you.

1124
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,773
Yeah,
man,

1125
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,340
I can't.
I've never been.

1126
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:24,174
I've been so averse to that shit.
I was talking to Louis about that 

1127
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:28,170
because he was boxing for a while and he
was like,

1128
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:30,010
I love sparring.
You're sparring.

1129
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,090
He goes,
yeah.

1130
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,290
I go,
how often do you sparring?

1131
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,000
And he's like,
you sparring quite a bit.

1132
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:35,410
I could do.
I go,

1133
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,393
I know you're having a good time,
but you have to understand like there 

1134
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,153
there's real consequences to this.
You're getting in car accidents 

1135
00:47:42,341 --> 00:47:43,750
constantly.
You're getting hit.

1136
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,733
You're getting hit in the head like that
counts and you're doing it when you're 

1137
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:48,904
48 years old like this and you're fat 
like so you're not moving a lot and 

1138
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,973
don't got great headbutts and like your,
your muscles aren't there to like take 

1139
00:47:57,221 --> 00:47:59,740
whatever that there's real consequences 
to getting here.

1140
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:01,660
How often do you do that?
I don't do that at all.

1141
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:02,860
You'll never get hit in the head.
No,

1142
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:03,970
I don't do it at all.
No,

1143
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,560
no.
I stopped doing it a long time ago.

1144
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,720
It's,
I hit the bag.

1145
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:08,554
I'll hit pads and I would spar with 
someone who I know well where I won't 

1146
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:14,350
hit them and they won't touch each 
other.

1147
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:15,940
It'd be like,
what about you?

1148
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:17,560
Yeah.
What about all these different?

1149
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,980
Because it's just choking on bars and 
stuff like that.

1150
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,150
There's no like there's no hitting each 
other.

1151
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:26,500
Know that hitting in the head is fun.
It's fun.

1152
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:28,690
It's fun to hit people.
It's fun to not get hit.

1153
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,120
It feels good to take a shot and give 
one back,

1154
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:35,290
but the consequences are real and I see 
too much of it.

1155
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,124
I see.
I see this slow degrading of your 

1156
00:48:40,301 --> 00:48:41,550
cognitive ability.

1157
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,810
I've seen it in too many people.
What do you think?

1158
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:47,130
What do you think anything's going to 
happen with football like you think it's

1159
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,243
are they going to like.
I think people are going to wise up and 

1160
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,833
I.
I think fighting is way better for you 

1161
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,510
than football and I think fighting is 
terrible for you.

1162
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:56,763
I think football is the worst because 
they're running at each other full clip 

1163
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:04,480
and slamming into each other all day.
It's like driving off a cliff constantly

1164
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:07,360
over and over and over again.
Fucking nuts.

1165
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,223
We have a friend and they have a kid 
who's in high school who has severe 

1166
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:13,294
depression from getting football.
He's all fucked up from football and 

1167
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:19,630
they can't believe that it happened so 
fast.

1168
00:49:19,631 --> 00:49:21,480
I would go.
How long has he been playing?

1169
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:22,643
Playing for a couple years.
He's been getting smashed in the head 

1170
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:28,600
for years because it's just like you and
you watch like a football practice.

1171
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,110
Those students are just like listening 
and less and less,

1172
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:33,850
and now I think they're finally 
realizing,

1173
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:36,340
but like when we were growing up,
all my buddies played football.

1174
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:37,174
Like every drill was like,
stand in a circle and let's have these 

1175
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:43,270
dudes fucking run into each other.
Speed over and over.

1176
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,104
Finding out.
Now they're getting hit in the body is 

1177
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,970
as bad as getting hit in the head.
Really?

1178
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,833
Yeah.
Because when you get slammed in the 

1179
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:54,040
body,
your head snaps back and your brain goes

1180
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:54,791
whoosh,
whoosh.

1181
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,190
Inside your skull.
And it,

1182
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,300
you think that concussions only come 
from getting a head injury.

1183
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,213
It's not the case.
They're finding the people get 

1184
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,010
concussions from getting hit in the 
body.

1185
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,890
So this is pure ignorance in boxing or 
whatever.

1186
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:10,930
When a guy gets knocked out,
he's getting,

1187
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,980
that's a concussion,
right?

1188
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,120
Oh yeah.
Most of the time,

1189
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,000
right?
Yeah.

1190
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,133
And so those guys are just getting.
They're getting concussions all the 

1191
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:17,690
time.
Yeah.

1192
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,740
And they get concussions even when they 
win sometimes.

1193
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:21,783
Like,
um,

1194
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:24,580
there's a guy named Joe Valtellina who's
been on the show before.

1195
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:28,250
He's a world championship kickboxer.
He had to retire after he won

1196
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:32,390
the title.
He won the fight and then afterwards his

1197
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:37,490
head injury was so severe he couldn't 
look at the light from a charger,

1198
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:38,480
from a phone,
you know,

1199
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:39,323
like a phone charger.
He had to be in total darkness for 

1200
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:43,400
months at a time or for weeks at a time 
rather.

1201
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:47,180
And what saved him was actually CBD oil.
Really?

1202
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:48,014
Yeah.
Cbd Oil is pretty good at reducing 

1203
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:50,954
inflammation.
It's pretty radical and its effect and 

1204
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:55,310
that that brought it all down for them.
I haven't.

1205
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,010
I haven't tried cbd oil very much.
Yeah,

1206
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,170
it's really good for pain and stuff like
that.

1207
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:00,670
It's great

1208
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:01,503
pain.
It's great for anxiety and one of the 

1209
00:51:02,951 --> 00:51:05,560
more important things.
It doesn't fuck with you.

1210
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,920
Like cognitively.
Yeah.

1211
00:51:07,921 --> 00:51:09,500
It doesn't make you high.
It's not right.

1212
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,080
So you can do it and just go do stuff,
but it alleviates anxiety.

1213
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:14,943
Calms you down.
Where do they think that maybe some 

1214
00:51:17,231 --> 00:51:21,100
anxiety may coincide with inflammation?
Oh,

1215
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:23,290
that makes sense.
Like physical inflammation,

1216
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:25,420
that it.
It makes sense.

1217
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:26,430
Oil,
you know,

1218
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,030
drops,
oil drops.

1219
00:51:28,031 --> 00:51:31,900
It's also good for just your,
just your overall,

1220
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:34,930
your whole system,
your gut biome.

1221
00:51:34,931 --> 00:51:35,690
It's good for everything.

1222
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,450
Yeah.
I've just been smoking weed forever.

1223
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,190
That's good too.
That helps.

1224
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,870
I went to a,
I went to burning man this year and uh,

1225
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,920
did,
had just a fucking wild time of,

1226
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,250
because I know you've talked about it.
I'd never done acid before.

1227
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,130
I did ask him for the first time.
How was it?

1228
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:57,560
It was fascinating.
I've done,

1229
00:51:57,561 --> 00:52:02,090
I've done mushrooms like somewhat 
regularly for most of my adult life,

1230
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,890
like not,
not crazy amounts but like,

1231
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,810
you know,
once a year depending on,

1232
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,760
you know,
um,

1233
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,220
and always loved it.
I'm like,

1234
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:09,103
I was like,
if I were left with one thing might be 

1235
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:14,570
that one because I liked the warmth,
like the organic,

1236
00:52:14,571 --> 00:52:15,404
the giggles,
the warmth and like everything love 

1237
00:52:16,911 --> 00:52:19,280
everybody.
I love everybody and it is what I,

1238
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,020
you know,
when people used to talk about like what

1239
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:22,160
ecstasy was,
I was like,

1240
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,180
oh,
that's mushrooms.

1241
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,720
Like you just feel giggly and warm and 
connected.

1242
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,030
Um,
but I was like,

1243
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:32,000
you know what we're going to have.
I'm going to burning man.

1244
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,800
Couple buddies were like,
I've,

1245
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:38,270
I've done this acid before and I haven't
read the Michael Pollan book,

1246
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,530
but I was like,
enough,

1247
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,210
there's enough gut to know you've been 
talking about it.

1248
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:42,590
There's enough around there that I'm 
like,

1249
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:43,371
I'm ready.
Like,

1250
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:44,204
because I remember in my late twenties 
someone being like trying to buy 

1251
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:47,810
mushrooms in there.
Like I got asked and I was like,

1252
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,580
I'm not going to do it.
Like I had,

1253
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:51,320
you know,
at least when we were kids,

1254
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:53,570
there was that fear that like you do 
acid,

1255
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,550
you could fry your brain forever and you
never come back.

1256
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,110
Right.
And I don't know if that was the kind of

1257
00:52:57,111 --> 00:53:00,590
asset people were doing or if it just.
People were doing a ton of it.

1258
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,570
They,
they think now that what that is,

1259
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,360
it's,
it's people that are schizophrenic,

1260
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,223
right.
And there's a certain percentage of the 

1261
00:53:08,091 --> 00:53:08,924
population,
like they were trying to make a 

1262
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:10,334
correlation between marijuana use in 
schizophrenia that it causes 

1263
00:53:14,151 --> 00:53:14,984
schizophrenia,
but they found out that the numbers are 

1264
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:16,994
the same as the general population.
The numbers of people who use marijuana 

1265
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:23,270
becomes schizophrenia because the same 
numbers is just you take 100 people,

1266
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,313
there's going to be one of them is going
to be schizophrenic or whatever the 

1267
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:27,054
number is,
whether it's one percent or higher and 

1268
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:29,483
they,
there's,

1269
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,443
they think though that it can exacerbate
the situation and it can actually bring 

1270
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:36,690
it on.
Like say maybe if someone has maybe sort

1271
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:37,524
of a manageable cause.
Schizophrenia exists like many diseases 

1272
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:42,930
do on a spectrum.
Sure.

1273
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,040
You know,
this is really bad.

1274
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:45,780
Cancer and his people have a mild 
cancer.

1275
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:50,810
They get over well with schizophrenia if
they do acid or if they do,

1276
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:53,450
I'm even edible.
Marijuana apparently can bring it

1277
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,360
shit,
man.

1278
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,010
I don't think I'm frantic,
but anytime I feel like I am,

1279
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,440
I can't eat it.
I can't.

1280
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:01,850
I'm just like,
immediately

1281
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,750
the thing is a little.
You got to do baby doses.

1282
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,613
That's the king.
The key with edible marijuana is great 

1283
00:54:08,021 --> 00:54:08,854
at about 10 to 20 milligrams.
Then you get to that Joey Diaz level 

1284
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:15,070
where he's doing 500,000
big boy.

1285
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,090
He's,
he's,

1286
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:18,010
he's not,
but even he quit.

1287
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,480
He quit edibles.
Really?

1288
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:20,130
Yeah,
he quit.

1289
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,320
I can't,
I just like early on I was like,

1290
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:24,630
I tried edibles and I just remember,
I remember,

1291
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:26,143
I remember being in Austin,
I don't know if it was south by or 

1292
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:30,390
whatever,
and I had like a cookie,

1293
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:31,980
like a little bit of a,
it was earlier,

1294
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:32,814
much earlier than now,
how regulated things are and I ate a 

1295
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:38,730
little bit and like went back to my 
hotel room and I was like,

1296
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,350
I can't even look.
I was like,

1297
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:43,350
I can't look at the screen.
And I just walked the streets,

1298
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,363
went to the city,
the capital of the state capital and 

1299
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,823
just looked at the pit,
like portraits of the former governors 

1300
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,910
of Texas and then was like,
got like sober ish.

1301
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,640
And then my buddies were like,
we're going to a gun range.

1302
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,520
And I was like,
I went to a gun range and it was like,

1303
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,910
I was like,
I'm not firing a gun,

1304
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,610
but I'll just like.

1305
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,990
And I was like,
Ooh,

1306
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,680
it was like eight hours later and I'm 
still like a mess.

1307
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,573
But,
uh,

1308
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,690
but,
but I was like,

1309
00:55:09,691 --> 00:55:11,670
you know what,
I'm going to burning man.

1310
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,593
I'm going to try acid,
I want with my buddy was my college 

1311
00:55:15,301 --> 00:55:17,930
roommate.
Neither of us had done it before a guide

1312
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,760
given it to us who I was like,
I've done this asset.

1313
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:21,660
I know how to do it.
He's like,

1314
00:55:21,661 --> 00:55:22,494
I recommend taking the assassin and 
listening to classical music and eating 

1315
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:27,990
fruit.
That was his.

1316
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,460
And I was like,
all right.

1317
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,503
I was like,
I like listening to classical music and 

1318
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:33,300
eat fruit.
And I was like,

1319
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,570
I like classical music and I like fruit.
So I was looking.

1320
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:37,680
I was like,
this sounds great.

1321
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:38,943
I was like,
so we're out in the fucking desert and 

1322
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:44,250
we eat it on our last day.
And have you been to burning man?

1323
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,480
No,
I,

1324
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,940
I thought it was,
I was kind of blown away.

1325
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:50,310
I've found it.
I've enjoyed it very,

1326
00:55:50,311 --> 00:55:52,560
very much fucking weird.
I mean,

1327
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:53,800
sure,
but it's,

1328
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:54,923
I dunno,
it was like people executing whatever 

1329
00:55:57,031 --> 00:55:57,864
they're doing incredibly well and 
there's a lot of different versions of 

1330
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:01,710
it and stuff,
but it's kind of,

1331
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:03,780
um,
there's a lot of pranksters.

1332
00:56:03,781 --> 00:56:04,410
They're like,
there's,

1333
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:05,243
it's actually not.
It's like there's a hippy dippy quality 

1334
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:07,584
to it,
but then there's some real people kind 

1335
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:11,730
of fucking with people in a fun way that
I got a kick out of,

1336
00:56:11,731 --> 00:56:14,490
but we took the,
took acid and like,

1337
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:17,010
I don't know,
four and we start,

1338
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,870
we're driving around the desert.
You know,

1339
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:19,920
you're,
everyone's on bikes.

1340
00:56:19,921 --> 00:56:22,830
You're just on a bike driving around.
Did you have to wear a mask?

1341
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,210
No,
the dust was fine.

1342
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,073
It was cool and like we start kind of 
feeling it and I have had visuals on 

1343
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:32,050
mushrooms before,
but this,

1344
00:56:32,051 --> 00:56:36,760
all of a sudden like the meltedness of 
everything started to set in and the.

1345
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,220
Have you done acid in the desert before?
No,

1346
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:40,940
never in the desert.
It's a,

1347
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:42,760
it's a good,
good place.

1348
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:45,200
A good place for it.
Just because like,

1349
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,200
visually what's happening is like,
um,

1350
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,410
is pretty interesting.
Like we went,

1351
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:54,310
we were driving around on bikes and we 
see these immediately.

1352
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:58,300
Then like some couples,
like can you take a picture of us as we,

1353
00:56:58,301 --> 00:56:59,134
um,
like try to do a duo yoga pose with the 

1354
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:02,770
sunset.
I'm like,

1355
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:06,160
okay,
I'm trying to deal with my camera.

1356
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:06,994
You know what I mean?
And you're like,

1357
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:10,600
okay,
I think I think this is what you want,

1358
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:11,434
you know,
and then we drive away from there and 

1359
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:13,174
there are these like porn stars who 
wanted pictures of the are taking 

1360
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,240
pictures of themselves and I was like,
we're like,

1361
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,083
you know,
we're in the burning man spirit of like 

1362
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:23,470
we'll give him the gift of our music and
like they don't want,

1363
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:24,670
they don't want.

1364
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:25,503
I'm not even hitting nothing.
I'm just like literally like driving 

1365
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:28,390
around.
We've got our little like,

1366
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,253
you know,
our little bluetooth speaker playing 

1367
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:32,920
classical music and they aren't,
they don't give a fuck.

1368
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:36,250
They don't want any of it.
And then we go and sit and,

1369
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:41,430
and we're just now starting to peak 
right at sunset in the desert.

1370
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:44,980
And it's like,
it was,

1371
00:57:44,981 --> 00:57:45,581
it was like,
oh,

1372
00:57:45,581 --> 00:57:49,360
this feels like a,
some version of what heaven feels like,

1373
00:57:49,361 --> 00:57:51,430
you know,
like where the sky,

1374
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:56,490
the colors in the sky are unbelievable.
And all of a sudden all the desert,

1375
00:57:56,861 --> 00:57:58,080
all the sand,
you know this,

1376
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,770
it's like this real fine alkaline dust.
And it's like,

1377
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:04,450
you feel like you're seeing some real 
like grid work,

1378
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:05,284
you know,
I don't know if you have that feeling 

1379
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:07,631
where you're like,
oh,

1380
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:08,464
I can feel like I'm seeing some 
underlying dynamics of the structural 

1381
00:58:12,911 --> 00:58:13,450
stuff.

1382
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,870
I've seen that on mushrooms.
He,

1383
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,753
yeah.
It feels like you're witness to the 

1384
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:23,100
pattern of things.
Like there's some sort of.

1385
00:58:23,101 --> 00:58:24,430
Yeah,
the structure of things.

1386
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,960
Yeah.
And that's what it felt like.

1387
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:29,440
You were like,
you're looking at this like this crazy,

1388
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:30,543
you know,
and you've got.

1389
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:31,501
Yeah.
So you're,

1390
00:58:31,501 --> 00:58:32,334
you're seeing the sand,
this very fine light sand with the 

1391
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:36,603
really red mountains.
And then the blue really crisp blue sky 

1392
00:58:40,811 --> 00:58:42,220
with,
with uh,

1393
00:58:42,221 --> 00:58:44,740
the white clouds.
And it felt like you were like,

1394
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:45,574
oh,
I'm seeing some structural shit that's 

1395
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:47,974
going on.
It's,

1396
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:48,933
it was quite.
And we're listening to this Guy Eric 

1397
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:51,814
said,
steve's like a classical musician and 

1398
00:58:53,651 --> 00:58:57,190
eating cherries and this is pretty 
fucking sweet.

1399
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,470
And I was like,
it's cool that you followed it to a t.

1400
00:58:59,471 --> 00:59:02,050
You went with the fruit and know why 
not?

1401
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:03,040
Let's just have it,
you know,

1402
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:05,350
why not.
And I think classical music is,

1403
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,720
but it was interesting because I,
I didn't.

1404
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,960
So then,
so then the sun sets and it's like,

1405
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,423
even at the height of it,
it didn't feel warm like mushrooms have 

1406
00:59:16,571 --> 00:59:21,440
felt.
It felt like co clinical.

1407
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,460
Clinical.
Exactly.

1408
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,250
That's exactly the worry about that.
Uh,

1409
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:27,410
it's very interesting that you said he 
took it riding bikes too,

1410
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:30,050
because that's in a lot of ways in Omaj 
to Albert Hoffman.

1411
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:33,410
That's how he found out about it.
You know,

1412
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:34,244
he synthesize lsd and you know,
got it in his skin when he was working 

1413
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:43,871
with it and then rode his bike home and 
on the bike ride home realized,

1414
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:45,680
oh my God,
whoa.

1415
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:49,470
Fucking tripping balls here without even
knowing what tripping.

1416
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:50,403
I mean he,
he knew something was going on and eat 

1417
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,451
it.
I mean,

1418
00:59:53,451 --> 00:59:55,160
he may,
I believe,

1419
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,413
correct me if I'm wrong,
but I believe the initial reason for 

1420
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:04,400
creating Lsd,
I think they were,

1421
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:08,030
they were trying to come up with a drug 
to induce labor.

1422
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,343
I'm pretty sure that was the original.
I think that's what they were working 

1423
01:00:12,921 --> 01:00:13,754
on.
And in the process synthesized LSD and 

1424
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,373
Lsd as a compound and it's one of those 
unbelievably potent compounds where 

1425
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:27,890
someone,
I think it was terrence,

1426
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:28,724
we kind of described it as the power to 
weight ratio is so huge that it's like 

1427
01:00:34,761 --> 01:00:39,740
if you had one aunt that dismantled the 
statue of Liberty in 30 minutes,

1428
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:44,420
like that's how,
that's how potent LSD is.

1429
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,150
Yeah.
Well,

1430
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:45,983
I mean I took,
it actually said the empire state 

1431
01:00:47,931 --> 01:00:48,764
building.
She's,

1432
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,970
I mean I took,
I took a,

1433
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,200
a responsible amount.
Like I was like,

1434
01:00:53,201 --> 01:00:54,034
I don't need to like

1435
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,990
losing my mind here.
I've only microdosed at ovenly.

1436
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,050
Well one,
one time I doubled the mic,

1437
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:00,893
but still it was a small dose.
If it was enough to just like I had 

1438
01:01:05,591 --> 01:01:06,424
planned the synthesis of the compound 
with the intention of obtaining a 

1439
01:01:08,391 --> 01:01:12,390
circulatory and respiratory stimulant.
Hoffman wrote the new substance,

1440
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:13,323
however arose no special interests in 
our pharmacologics pharmacologists and 

1441
01:01:16,751 --> 01:01:19,510
physicians.
Testing was therefore discontinued.

1442
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:20,853
Huh?
Why did I think I said 25th attempt 

1443
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:28,240
aptly named Lsd?
Twenty five.

1444
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,880
Not knowing he was not after like a 
psychedelic drug.

1445
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,430
No,
I don't believe so.

1446
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,750
Dose to four,
20:00

1447
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,520
PM.
Y'All look at it and go down and look at

1448
01:01:36,521 --> 01:01:39,280
that.
Go Down Clarius.

1449
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,173
Yeah.
He dosed himself for 20 most intense 

1450
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:47,704
from six to 8:00
PM during that time he rode home on his 

1451
01:01:49,481 --> 01:01:50,314
bicycle.

1452
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:51,810
It's the best.
It feels great.

1453
01:01:51,811 --> 01:01:53,220
So the,
so we,

1454
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,480
we,
we sort of are peeking around sunset and

1455
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:58,314
it's like,
it feels like I'm with my buddy of 20 

1456
01:02:00,601 --> 01:02:01,434
years I've known him since college.
We've gone through our lives together 

1457
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:06,870
and there's a thing when you eat,
when you trip,

1458
01:02:06,871 --> 01:02:09,460
where you're like that space time 
continuum thing.

1459
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:10,303
There's like,
it feels less linear time where you're 

1460
01:02:11,731 --> 01:02:12,564
like I'm having thoughts that I had 20 
years ago and I'm having them today and 

1461
01:02:15,661 --> 01:02:18,520
I'm going to have them in 20 years in 
like where this,

1462
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,180
the nature of all of this feels a little
less,

1463
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,073
you know?
And I'm with my buddies had been a 

1464
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:24,570
witness to my life,
you know?

1465
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:25,853
So we're having this great large 
conversation about our lives and all 

1466
01:02:28,471 --> 01:02:30,690
that shit and the sun setting.
It's beautiful.

1467
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:34,050
And then it gets dark and it's like,
all right,

1468
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,780
let's go watch the man burn now.

1469
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:40,320
Like you know that at burning man,
everybody gathers 70,000

1470
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:41,154
people gather.
You go to this big central area where 

1471
01:02:44,371 --> 01:02:45,204
the man who has been sitting there for 
seven days is then there's like a crazy 

1472
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:49,224
fire starter show,
fireworks go off and then you burn this 

1473
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,030
30 foot man and it's dark and it's 
night.

1474
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:01,340
And,
and it's like it was the other side.

1475
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,890
It felt like heaven and hell,
you know,

1476
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,793
where you're all of a sudden.
And that's where I felt like it was 

1477
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:09,690
weird because like that's where I felt 
the clinical thing where I'm like,

1478
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:14,100
I feel sort of high,
but I now feel actually quite in a weird

1479
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:16,290
way quite sober.
And I'm,

1480
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:17,213
I felt like I'm witnessing these things 
and I feel removed from them in a way 

1481
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:21,714
that when you're.
I feel like when you're on mushrooms in 

1482
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:27,900
some way you're like,
you feel kind of inside of the,

1483
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:30,150
the flow of,
of,

1484
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,620
of,
of nature.

1485
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,810
And.
But I was also like,

1486
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,330
it's the end by the time of the end of 
burning man,

1487
01:03:36,331 --> 01:03:37,164
like there are people there all week and
building it and putting all this stuff 

1488
01:03:39,241 --> 01:03:40,530
together and artists.
It's interesting.

1489
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:41,573
And then like there is definitely have a
section of burning man which is just 

1490
01:03:44,341 --> 01:03:48,920
like super wealthy people showing up for
like debauchery and,

1491
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:53,280
and like to be around models who were 
nearly naked and it's like.

1492
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:55,700
And that's when you look around and,
and,

1493
01:03:55,740 --> 01:04:00,740
and the aesthetic of burning man is like
somewhere between like I'm Mad Max,

1494
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:02,663
game of thrones and Tron.
It's somewhere in that space which is 

1495
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:08,844
fucking Rad.
But then when you were kind of on acid 

1496
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:11,724
and you're kind of looking around and I 
had this feeling of like the rich are 

1497
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:19,470
here to collect their spoils.
You know what I mean?

1498
01:04:19,471 --> 01:04:20,400
Like these.

1499
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,773
Do you think that having the great 
experience of seeing the sky in the 

1500
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:29,940
desert and all the beauty and when 
you're like wow this is amazing.

1501
01:04:29,941 --> 01:04:30,774
And then when you have something like a 
fire and then on top of that you have a 

1502
01:04:33,811 --> 01:04:34,644
giant group of people.
It seemed and then you realize there's 

1503
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:37,974
not really a lot of law enforcement here
and like just seems like it could be 

1504
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:40,920
completely chaotic.

1505
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:41,860
Yeah,
it's.

1506
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:42,793
And it is like the fire itself is 
protected because I think someone ran 

1507
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:47,310
into the fire last year.
Died,

1508
01:04:47,311 --> 01:04:47,850
right?
Yeah.

1509
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:48,683
Fucking killed himself.
Joe Ran right into that fire this year 

1510
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:54,100
was like,
this year was pretty well regulated like

1511
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:58,270
because we had seen a couple nights 
before at sunrise there was like,

1512
01:04:58,290 --> 01:04:59,130
you know,
they have all this.

1513
01:04:59,150 --> 01:04:59,983
It's what I found too,
it was like the kind of the duality of 

1514
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:03,603
adult,
like burning man feels very much like 

1515
01:05:04,561 --> 01:05:05,394
there's this like sacred and profane 
shit all happening together and it's 

1516
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,473
oftentimes pretty cool.
And like sunrise a couple mornings 

1517
01:05:13,231 --> 01:05:14,064
earlier,
there's this like 20 foot wooden dragon 

1518
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:20,800
statue that someone had built and they 
are,

1519
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:21,970
they light it on fire,
you know,

1520
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,380
they're just like,
now we're going to burn it.

1521
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:24,303
Like some dude had spent a year making 
this statue is like now we're going to 

1522
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:27,874
fucking burn it.

1523
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:28,773
And so there,
there were park rangers all around it 

1524
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,553
and so there's no getting inside.
They light it on fire and then the sun 

1525
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:38,890
rises over to the left and then you 
looked at.

1526
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:39,724
I looked up and there were like 30 
people parachuting out of the sky at 

1527
01:05:43,331 --> 01:05:45,670
sunrise and you're just like,
what the fuck is going on?

1528
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:47,860
But it was,
it was really cool.

1529
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,840
I really,
I enjoyed that.

1530
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,620
But by the time Saturday rolled around,
you know,

1531
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:54,454
there is something about fire that's 
very primal and you can feel like 

1532
01:05:57,791 --> 01:06:01,900
there's like there's some pagan quality 
to it all and it's cool,

1533
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:02,734
but it's like you could feel like 
everybody's like energy kind of getting 

1534
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:11,440
a little darker and more primal and,
and I hit a point where I was like,

1535
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:14,990
all right guys,
I gotta I gotta get out of this like 75.

1536
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,250
And I also had a fear of like,
I wasn't scared of the fire.

1537
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:21,520
I was scared of like I was seated 
watching and I was like,

1538
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:22,780
I'm scared of a trampling.

1539
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:23,823
Yeah,
that's what I mean by like the giant 

1540
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:26,194
group of people.
And then also with a fire and then a 

1541
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:30,064
gathering when,
when you're dealing with a big 

1542
01:06:31,931 --> 01:06:33,820
gathering,
there's always the potential for someone

1543
01:06:33,821 --> 01:06:38,821
acting out whether they just need a lot 
of attention or they go crazy or mean.

1544
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:42,970
Think about adverse reactions to 
psychedelics.

1545
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:44,530
Yes.
And 70,000

1546
01:06:44,531 --> 01:06:45,364
people,
the potential for something going 

1547
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:47,860
haywire is pretty high.

1548
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:49,070
Yeah.
Well,

1549
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:52,550
what I found interesting over the whole 
week was because I was pretty skeptical.

1550
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:54,530
I didn't go in.
I went in being like,

1551
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,070
I want to experience this thing that a 
lot of people have experienced.

1552
01:06:58,071 --> 01:07:00,320
I just want to know what that experience
is.

1553
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,513
Um,
but what I've found fascinating is 

1554
01:07:03,351 --> 01:07:05,780
there's,
there's some law enforcement around,

1555
01:07:05,781 --> 01:07:08,870
there's some ranges around,
but there's really no,

1556
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:09,763
it's pretty anarchical,
like there's really very little but in 

1557
01:07:13,711 --> 01:07:14,544
is in so much.
There's actually like some unspoken 

1558
01:07:18,651 --> 01:07:20,630
rules that basically everybody's Kinda 
following,

1559
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:23,330
which I found kind of fascinating where 
you're like,

1560
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,950
there's no.
Everybody's on bikes.

1561
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:29,960
They're crazy art cars running around 
with like fucking shooting fire into the

1562
01:07:29,961 --> 01:07:30,890
air.
But there's no,

1563
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,250
there seems to be no like regulatory 
board being like,

1564
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,383
let me make sure that the,
you're crazy 30 foot three tiered iron 

1565
01:07:40,731 --> 01:07:43,560
car is up to standard.

1566
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:45,613
There seems to be very little of that.
And yet it all seems to function pretty 

1567
01:07:50,061 --> 01:07:53,900
smoothly.
Like there's some unspoken acceptance of

1568
01:07:53,901 --> 01:07:56,120
certain rules.
I'm sure there are people freaking out.

1569
01:07:56,121 --> 01:07:59,330
I know there are people like it,
but it's mostly people like being like I

1570
01:07:59,331 --> 01:08:03,000
took too much drugs and I didn't hydrate
and like they go to the medic and there.

1571
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:07,280
But like weirdly I've found it all 
operating pretty smoothly.

1572
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,460
Uh,
but that's when the,

1573
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,031
the,
uh,

1574
01:08:11,031 --> 01:08:14,420
the acid then sort of turned a bit where
I was,

1575
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,130
there's some darkness here that I want 
to get away from.

1576
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:21,083
It seems like whenever you have a 
situation where you've got a bunch of 

1577
01:08:23,941 --> 01:08:27,210
people that want to do something outside
the norm,

1578
01:08:27,211 --> 01:08:28,044
they want to get together and they want 
to experience something that's just 

1579
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:33,870
their board society.
And this is their big break.

1580
01:08:33,871 --> 01:08:38,580
And it seems like there's,
there's so much expectations and there's

1581
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:42,930
kind of a code that these people want to
follow and that code is that,

1582
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:43,783
you know,
it's almost like a utopian vision of a 

1583
01:08:46,051 --> 01:08:48,570
better society,
even if it's for only a week or so.

1584
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,110
Yeah.

1585
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:50,790
And I think it works for a week.
Like,

1586
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:51,624
I don't know if society.
I don't know how a society would 

1587
01:08:54,121 --> 01:08:54,954
function and like largely lawless.
I mean the biggest rules are like don't 

1588
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:01,650
put your trash anywhere.
Like there's no garbage cans anywhere.

1589
01:09:01,651 --> 01:09:04,530
Don't pee outside like p and a Porta 
Potty,

1590
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:08,250
pee in a jug ticket back,
dump it out because there's no mark,

1591
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,113
no leave,
no,

1592
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,000
no mark.
And it works.

1593
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:14,310
But I guess it works for a week where 
you're like,

1594
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:18,150
everybody's agreed for that week and 
then you go back to your life.

1595
01:09:18,151 --> 01:09:20,400
But like,
I dunno,

1596
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,050
it was,
I got a fucking kick out of it.

1597
01:09:22,051 --> 01:09:22,950
Like there's.
And there's,

1598
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,660
you know,
there's like we,

1599
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,010
there's one night,
you know,

1600
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:28,380
there are all these crazy light shows at
night.

1601
01:09:28,381 --> 01:09:30,950
It,
it becomes like this crazy tron,

1602
01:09:30,951 --> 01:09:31,784
like light show everywhere you look,
you see the horizon for as far as you 

1603
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:38,730
can see is just like people on bikes 
that are all lit up,

1604
01:09:38,731 --> 01:09:41,700
crazy art cars,
crazy pieces of art that are lit up.

1605
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,820
Um,
and it's really wild.

1606
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:46,440
But like you go,
you know,

1607
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:47,283
you ride around bikes and there were all
of a sudden we roll up to this area 

1608
01:09:49,201 --> 01:09:50,034
where there's a,
like a mechanical arm holding these 

1609
01:09:51,901 --> 01:09:53,710
lights that are,
um,

1610
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,600
led lights that are in this,
you know,

1611
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:59,820
in a circle and you lie below it and 
it's like a light show,

1612
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:02,550
you know,
it's this like vortex light show.

1613
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:06,030
So everybody's kind of looking up at it 
and it's really trippy and fun.

1614
01:10:06,031 --> 01:10:06,870
And impairment was like,
Whoa,

1615
01:10:06,871 --> 01:10:09,690
that's a trippy.
And I laid down and I was like,

1616
01:10:09,691 --> 01:10:12,300
this is red.
And then this dude rolls up.

1617
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,060
My friend sees us,
uh,

1618
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,480
you know,
those costumes of like,

1619
01:10:15,481 --> 01:10:16,700
um,
uh,

1620
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:17,534
those like tyrannosaurus rex like that 
they're inflated and the kind of or 

1621
01:10:20,491 --> 01:10:21,400
like,
you know,

1622
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:25,470
you see like dude's like one individual 
sides things,

1623
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,210
but they're like,
it's super weird.

1624
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,373
So I look at this guy and I start 
cracking up and my buddy just took that 

1625
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:33,573
turn a source rex and walked him through
the middle of everybody having their 

1626
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:39,030
quiet trippy moment,
you know,

1627
01:10:39,031 --> 01:10:42,720
so like this just kind of rolls through 
it and he's just like,

1628
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,190
hey,
you know,

1629
01:10:44,191 --> 01:10:46,640
and he's just like,
he was here before you,

1630
01:10:46,641 --> 01:10:47,474
you know,
and it's like,

1631
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:48,583
so it's kind of fun.
It's just like everybody's like having 

1632
01:10:52,321 --> 01:10:53,154
their trippy moment and then it gets 
fucked up and then a minute later 

1633
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:56,970
they're back to the trippy moment.
You know,

1634
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,200
I,
I got a real,

1635
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,060
I got to fucking kick out of.
It was weird.

1636
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:01,943
I don't know if that would work longterm
either because you'd have to have 

1637
01:11:04,171 --> 01:11:05,100
resources,
right?

1638
01:11:05,101 --> 01:11:07,770
You have to have food and water and 
land.

1639
01:11:07,771 --> 01:11:10,140
And then who controls the food?
Water and land.

1640
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,273
I think one of the things,
the reason why it works so well is 

1641
01:11:13,261 --> 01:11:14,130
because it's

1642
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:18,660
outside of culture,
like south side of civilization.

1643
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:20,430
You go to a place and everybody meets 
their.

1644
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,540
Yes,
yes.

1645
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:25,230
Nobody has an established like dominance
or domain over it at all.

1646
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:29,100
You just are entering on the same page 
and talking about this a lot lately.

1647
01:11:29,101 --> 01:11:32,640
Like cults never work like there's not a
single,

1648
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:36,990
like one of these wild wild country 
things or you know,

1649
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:41,990
a waco or the guys in the.
What was the one in San Diego?

1650
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:43,500
They cut their balls out of.
Yeah.

1651
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,240
Gave.
They never work.

1652
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,890
They never work.
No one has nailed it.

1653
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:49,920
Like how come no one can,
but burning man's kind of nailed it.

1654
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:50,963
They've been.
The way they nailed it is they just do 

1655
01:11:52,471 --> 01:11:54,940
it for a little bit and then they go 
back to life and it's,

1656
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:59,520
I guess the guy who founded it or is one
of them passed away this past year,

1657
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:02,790
so they think he was in the middle of 
the burn this year and.

1658
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,570
But even he is.
It's not a cult of personality.

1659
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,040
Like I think that's the thing,
you know,

1660
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:11,790
if you decentralize that and at the 
center of it is like,

1661
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:15,120
is this fucking man burning?
Is like,

1662
01:12:15,121 --> 01:12:15,954
I think if you take that element away,
I think the problem with culture is 

1663
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:19,740
they're all there.
I mean,

1664
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:24,720
is there any code that isn't like driven
by one central force?

1665
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:25,583
It's always a person.
It's always a person that always gets 

1666
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:28,464
fucked up because that person uses it or
an and it's all run through them and 

1667
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:36,060
then if he or she goes away,
then it's the next round of that person.

1668
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,213
They're always,
it's always playing off of this weird 

1669
01:12:38,641 --> 01:12:42,660
Alpha chimpanzee instinct that we have 
to have like a big daddy,

1670
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,753
the daddy that has all the messages and 
is in touch with God or the Ufo behind 

1671
01:12:47,941 --> 01:12:49,680
the asteroid or whatever the fuck it is.

1672
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:54,380
There's always this one person,
whether it's Jim Jones or you know,

1673
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,253
fill in the blank.
There's someone who has all the answers 

1674
01:12:58,141 --> 01:13:00,930
and there's a weird desire that people 
have to,

1675
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:03,900
to look to this one person that has all 
the answers.

1676
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:05,280
Yes.
It's very,

1677
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:05,710
it's.
Well,

1678
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:06,543
it's a tribal thing.
It's traveling and it's specifically if 

1679
01:13:08,431 --> 01:13:11,880
you're someone who gets into a cult,
you are searching for something,

1680
01:13:11,881 --> 01:13:12,714
you're searching for some solidity or or
something and and if you've got that 

1681
01:13:16,171 --> 01:13:18,060
person at the middle is like,
I got you,

1682
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,050
don't worry,
I'll give you.

1683
01:13:19,051 --> 01:13:20,880
I'll give you the way it often works.
People are like,

1684
01:13:20,881 --> 01:13:22,380
oh thank God.
Yeah,

1685
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,453
you know,
but I was thinking I was thinking about 

1686
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:28,440
like scientology and being like,
well shit man.

1687
01:13:28,441 --> 01:13:29,274
Tom Cruise,
like if you can learn to fly a 

1688
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:34,170
helicopter in like four months,
like maybe it's not so bad.

1689
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,060
Bill Bergen,
fly helicopter.

1690
01:13:36,061 --> 01:13:38,090
No he doesn't.
He didn't use scientology,

1691
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,113
the helicopter instructor,
but it took them probably a couple of 

1692
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:42,900
years.
I don't think it took them that long,

1693
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:47,610
but Gilbert did fucking billboard is a 
dude who likes to like figure stuff out.

1694
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,530
Yeah.
He's a really good drummer.

1695
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,780
Seen him drum.
I mean I know.

1696
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,670
I mean I think I've seen like a youtube 
of it,

1697
01:13:53,671 --> 01:13:56,730
but I'm like he could be in a band.
Yeah.

1698
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,110
But in his cars like he is,
he is building that truck.

1699
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,060
Like he is old,
68,

1700
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,290
68 Ford pickup?
I think so,

1701
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:06,240
yeah.
Yeah.

1702
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:07,910
That thing's cool.
That's got,

1703
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:08,763
um,
that's a manual transmission on the 

1704
01:14:10,621 --> 01:14:11,980
column.
It's one

1705
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,813
of those weird old school ones where we 
shift the gears like next to the 

1706
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:18,360
steering wheel.
That's how they used to do it.

1707
01:14:18,361 --> 01:14:19,194
Yeah.
But I think they called it three on the 

1708
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:20,944
tree and he fucking loves.
I mean that's a brain that likes that 

1709
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:26,283
stuff and likes,
like wants to learn to master flying a 

1710
01:14:29,771 --> 01:14:31,510
helicopter.
There's a couple,

1711
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:33,280
there's a couple of improvisors I know 
too,

1712
01:14:33,281 --> 01:14:36,910
like who were like a Thomas middleditch 
learn to fly a plane.

1713
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:38,230
My Buddy Neil Casey,
I'm like,

1714
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:42,040
that stuff is a real.
I'm like hobbyists in that way.

1715
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:43,870
My,
I'm just like,

1716
01:14:43,871 --> 01:14:45,580
I don't care.
You don't have any hobbies.

1717
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:50,970
I like hiking and I like,
uh,

1718
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:53,110
uh,
that's a good exercise.

1719
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:54,130
Yeah.
I,

1720
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:55,810
my brain wants it.
My brain wants that.

1721
01:14:55,811 --> 01:14:57,490
And,
and I do yoga now.

1722
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,720
Do the hot yoga or regular yoga,
regular yoga to do hot yoga.

1723
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:02,890
Hot Yoga.

1724
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:04,780
Just get that fucking sweat.
Yeah,

1725
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:05,351
it's,
it's,

1726
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:06,340
uh,
there's,

1727
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,360
there's a study that they just did on it
or they're,

1728
01:15:08,361 --> 01:15:09,194
they're in the process of doing it right
now at Harvard where they're trying to 

1729
01:15:11,831 --> 01:15:12,664
find out whether you can get similar 
results to sauna that you get for hot 

1730
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:20,460
yoga because they think it's a similar 
situation.

1731
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:25,090
The top with what's called sidechains 
heat shock proteins.

1732
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,470
And what would they showed in these 
saunas studies.

1733
01:15:29,471 --> 01:15:30,304
Is that 20 minutes a day,
four times a week decreased all cause 

1734
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:38,530
mortality by 40 percent.
All cause all cause mortality,

1735
01:15:38,531 --> 01:15:40,330
meaning heart attack,
stroke,

1736
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:43,210
cancer from just sweating and sweating 
it out.

1737
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:44,063
Yeah.
Well your body reacts to that extreme 

1738
01:15:45,581 --> 01:15:48,160
heat when it's,
I believe the number.

1739
01:15:48,161 --> 01:15:49,950
What did Ron say?
Was it one 80?

1740
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:55,190
I think she said 180 degrees.
One slash 71 80 or something like that.

1741
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,800
One seven year one eight.

1742
01:15:56,950 --> 01:16:01,270
And you do that for 20 minutes four 
times a week and it's,

1743
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,253
there's a radical decreasing of your,
just your overall systemic inflammation 

1744
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,550
because of that.
And that's getting it.

1745
01:16:09,551 --> 01:16:11,920
That hot makes you less inflamed because
it's like,

1746
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,450
right,
we got it out of our system there.

1747
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,950
Well,
your body reacts to it.

1748
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:15,823
Your body reacts to that.
He and it produces these heat shock 

1749
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:19,144
proteins and these heat shock proteins 
apparently had just fantastic at 

1750
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:25,150
decreasing inflammation all throughout 
your body.

1751
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:28,000
I gotta figure that out because it's all
based for me.

1752
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:31,280
Is like turning red one here.
Yeah,

1753
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,133
fucking love it.
I use it all the time almost every day 

1754
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,020
and you just sweat it out.
Go in there and crank that bitch up.

1755
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:37,863
And I found that air pods.
You can put air pods and they don't 

1756
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:43,740
overheat.
Your phone will overheat.

1757
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,160
Yes.
You can't have your phone in there.

1758
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:45,993
It'll shut off.
Yeah.

1759
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:46,893
But you could have your phone outside 
the song and have the air pods on and 

1760
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,790
you can just listen to a podcast or 
listen to a book on tape.

1761
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:54,790
What are you listening to?
A visually podcasts?

1762
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,580
Yeah.
He lives in New York.

1763
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,053
Not,
I listened to mine if it sucked or if 

1764
01:17:00,461 --> 01:17:02,350
it's something that I need to,
uh,

1765
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:06,610
like Rhonda Patrick,
she's spouting out science and I have to

1766
01:17:06,611 --> 01:17:08,830
hear it over and over again to get it 
into my stupid brain.

1767
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:09,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

1768
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:10,543
But um,
or if I have liked that podcast sucked 

1769
01:17:12,801 --> 01:17:15,680
and I need to listen to it to find out 
where it went off the rails,

1770
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:17,480
know,
because that's.

1771
01:17:17,481 --> 01:17:18,314
Yeah,
that's isn't that the bummer of being a 

1772
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:20,953
try to be a good at what you do is being
like paying more attention to the shit 

1773
01:17:23,511 --> 01:17:26,630
that doesn't work.
I have to like a bad sets,

1774
01:17:26,631 --> 01:17:29,600
bad comedy sense.
I always listen to those.

1775
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:30,523
I fucking hate him.
I don't even like listen to the good 

1776
01:17:32,391 --> 01:17:35,330
ones,
but the bad ones are ruthlessly painful.

1777
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:36,203
Fuck

1778
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:37,303
yes.
And I got to listen to the good ones 

1779
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:40,490
because I'm.
Because I'm like,

1780
01:17:40,491 --> 01:17:43,360
what did I not like?
W W,

1781
01:17:43,361 --> 01:17:45,350
w what was so special about me?
But being like,

1782
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:47,220
oh I improvise this,
this and this.

1783
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:50,290
So that's big too.
But the problem is like part of the joy.

1784
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:51,463
The reason it was fun because it felt 
fresh and then you try to recreate it 

1785
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,010
and it just doesn't have the same 
fucking juice.

1786
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:02,270
It's possible to recreate some things.
Yes.

1787
01:18:02,271 --> 01:18:05,060
Some things they just.
They were in the moment,

1788
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:05,923
the audience.
This is a thing that the audience knows 

1789
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:08,354
to like if you have a.
have you ever seen a guy who's faking 

1790
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:14,480
improvising?
It's the saddest thing ever.

1791
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,120
When you see someone work the crowd and 
then you go,

1792
01:18:17,121 --> 01:18:20,890
this guy's brilliant and they see him 
the next night he does the same shit and

1793
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,160
you go,
oh,

1794
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:23,280
it's a trek.
Yeah,

1795
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:26,180
well you,
you can.

1796
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:27,343
There's a moment that happens when 
you're improvising with an audience 

1797
01:18:30,711 --> 01:18:31,544
where someone says something and you 
just have the perfect response out of 

1798
01:18:33,741 --> 01:18:34,574
nowhere.
They know that you just came up with it 

1799
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:41,130
and nowhere and it just works,
but there's also lines that you add to a

1800
01:18:41,361 --> 01:18:44,870
bit that just came up out of nowhere and
maybe they just crushed that night,

1801
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:45,973
but they're still viable.
There's something to it you to figure 

1802
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:49,020
out how to

1803
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,160
create it.
Yes,

1804
01:18:50,161 --> 01:18:53,130
but it's that.
It's that feeling also of not wanting to

1805
01:18:53,131 --> 01:18:58,131
be a how do you build material onstage,
keep it,

1806
01:18:58,410 --> 01:19:00,750
have it feel fresh without feeling like 
a fraud.

1807
01:19:00,751 --> 01:19:02,130
Like a parliament.
Judicious.

1808
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,300
Yeah.
Which I think is,

1809
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,030
which is sort of like the tricky,
the tricky thing to do.

1810
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:10,880
You got to be less self aware and you 
got to be more involved.

1811
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:11,743
Like for me at least I have to be more 
connected to the idea that I'm saying 

1812
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:17,953
like I have to recreate my own personal 
wonderment that's involved in the idea 

1813
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:27,360
because they can smell it if you have 
to.

1814
01:19:27,361 --> 01:19:29,150
Like you have to really be in the 
moment.

1815
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:30,830
Like if you're doing a bit about bottled
water,

1816
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:33,020
you have to be thinking about bottled 
water.

1817
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:37,490
Like you have to be like what in the 
fuck it and then it has to be real.

1818
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:38,383
It has to be.
But if you're not thinking about it and 

1819
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:43,130
you're just saying the words,
they fucking smelly,

1820
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,110
smelly animals,
they fucking know it.

1821
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:47,020
Yeah.
Even when they,

1822
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:48,810
even when they're psyched to see you and
they liked you,

1823
01:19:48,811 --> 01:19:52,060
it's still there.
Still like a weird thing.

1824
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,760
You're not in it.
Yeah,

1825
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,280
I can,
but you got to be warm or you back out.

1826
01:19:56,281 --> 01:19:56,641
You're,
you're,

1827
01:19:56,641 --> 01:19:59,080
I mean I've seen you doing spots.
You're back out building the new.

1828
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:01,580
Yeah,
I'm at like 25,

1829
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,060
30 minutes.
Fuck Ish.

1830
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:06,710
Right now I just can't seem to because 
it's a grind.

1831
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:08,160
It's a grind man.

1832
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,390
And I just like,
I don't know how I'm like,

1833
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:11,660
I do my show.
We do,

1834
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:12,090
you know,
we,

1835
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:14,810
we write big mouth that takes us like 
five,

1836
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:18,660
six months to write and voice it.
And then,

1837
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:21,990
and when I'm writing all day,
it's tough to go out new spots at night.

1838
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:25,640
What was it like to break it up to do 
your Broadway Gig for awhile?

1839
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:27,120
Yeah,
it was great.

1840
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:30,360
I mean that was the most fun that was 
like me and Melanie do.

1841
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:33,420
We did it off Broadway,
uh,

1842
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:36,270
for like 25 days,
something like that.

1843
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:39,870
And then toward it a little bit,
five days in Boston,

1844
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:41,580
five days in DC,
la,

1845
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:42,423
New York,
whatever.

1846
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:43,520
And on New York.
Um,

1847
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,060
and then we went back into the Broadway 
show.

1848
01:20:45,061 --> 01:20:49,470
We did 140 shows like 138 shows every 
night,

1849
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,780
you know,
five show weekends.

1850
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,370
And that was the most fun.
That was the most fun because it's,

1851
01:20:56,371 --> 01:20:57,780
you're onstage with your buddy.

1852
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:01,230
Um,
so you got someone even on the nights is

1853
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,070
not working,
you know,

1854
01:21:02,071 --> 01:21:03,650
when you're doing a show and you're 
like,

1855
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,730
I know they liked me,
but this is not fun.

1856
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,870
They're tired,
whatever.

1857
01:21:06,871 --> 01:21:08,850
And you got it right,
but you're up there alone.

1858
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:09,923
All of a sudden you're,
you got someone else up there who you 

1859
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,420
can make eye contact with me.
Like,

1860
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:16,290
fuck these fucking,
let's fuck them a little bit.

1861
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:19,590
You know what I mean?
Without saying a word we both know we're

1862
01:21:19,591 --> 01:21:20,970
like,
let's fuck with them tonight.

1863
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,370
Um,
and we,

1864
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:25,020
because we wrote it,
we could improvise,

1865
01:21:25,021 --> 01:21:25,854
change whatever we wanted every night.
It was like having a standup set that 

1866
01:21:28,861 --> 01:21:33,450
you could improvise with your buddy in 
character that was,

1867
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:37,170
you knew every beat you had to hit,
but you had a lot of freedom within it.

1868
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:39,060
It was,
it was the most fun.

1869
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:43,160
So it's like stand up but not.
Yeah,

1870
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:44,003
like it was largely we built it to be 
presentational so we could talk to the 

1871
01:21:47,851 --> 01:21:48,684
audience at any point because there's 
something about doing like a play or 

1872
01:21:51,511 --> 01:21:55,110
even when I was early on doing sketch,
it's embarrassing,

1873
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:57,330
you know what I mean?
You're like,

1874
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:58,653
we're going to,
I guess we're going to pretend like 

1875
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:02,700
we're in a fucking Chinese restaurant 
right now,

1876
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:05,580
but you're in the audience were all in 
the same room right now.

1877
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,610
It's like,
it sucks to not be able to do a joke and

1878
01:22:08,611 --> 01:22:09,444
not have a work and not be able to like 
talk to the audience about it or be 

1879
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:13,590
angry at the audience directly or 
whatever it is.

1880
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:14,903
So we could do that.
So we are presentational like you're 

1881
01:22:16,471 --> 01:22:17,304
doing standup,
but we've written this play that has 

1882
01:22:18,361 --> 01:22:21,630
real scenes in it.
And then we built in an interview in the

1883
01:22:21,631 --> 01:22:24,930
middle where we would interview 
different people like on the,

1884
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:28,680
on the Netflix special,
Steve Martin and uh,

1885
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:31,410
and we also had Michael J.
Fox was on special as well,

1886
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:33,930
but every night it was someone different
and it was anyone from,

1887
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,870
you know,
we got letterman to do it,

1888
01:22:36,871 --> 01:22:40,310
but we also had like Robin Byrd,
remember Robin Byrd,

1889
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:45,340
she was the channel Jay cable access 
porn stripper interview show in New York

1890
01:22:45,811 --> 01:22:46,644
and like the eighties and nineties,
there is no reason you would know it 

1891
01:22:48,751 --> 01:22:53,280
except if like you were 13 and going to 
sleep at your friend's house in the city

1892
01:22:53,281 --> 01:22:56,520
and jerking off the fucking street 
troopers getting interviewed like I was.

1893
01:22:57,210 --> 01:23:00,900
I kind of remember the name.
I kind of remember that Google,

1894
01:23:00,901 --> 01:23:02,520
Robin Byrd,
you'll see some old.

1895
01:23:02,521 --> 01:23:03,940
There she is,
you know,

1896
01:23:03,941 --> 01:23:08,380
it was like you could just the quality 
of that kind of like cable access,

1897
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,130
eighties New York Shit.
Um,

1898
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:12,123
we had her on the show because we felt 
like our boys would be interacting with 

1899
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:16,570
Robin Byrd,
you know.

1900
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,840
Um,
so we'd have her and then we add like,

1901
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:21,160
you know,
crazy.

1902
01:23:21,161 --> 01:23:23,290
So every night we got to interview 
someone different.

1903
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:26,890
It's like a mini live podcasts in the 
middle of the show.

1904
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:31,000
So we just built the most fun show for 
us to do every night.

1905
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:32,470
It was great,
it was the most fun.

1906
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:36,010
And then we finished that and then came 
back and I did that.

1907
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,233
We wrote that,
we did that in between season one and 

1908
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:43,030
season two of a big mouth,
uh,

1909
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:46,900
because it takes so long to write it and
the to animate it and all that stuff.

1910
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:49,350
So that was.
So we,

1911
01:23:49,351 --> 01:23:52,540
we wrote voice most of big mouth season 
two before,

1912
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:55,570
uh,
you know,

1913
01:23:55,780 --> 01:24:00,220
last year just takes forever.
So in the time that you did it,

1914
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:01,083
you did,
you do stand up at all while you're 

1915
01:24:02,141 --> 01:24:05,260
doing or just did it while we were 
doing.

1916
01:24:05,261 --> 01:24:05,681
Oh,
hello.

1917
01:24:05,681 --> 01:24:07,750
There was no standup at all.
We're doing big mouth.

1918
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:08,584
We,
I'd go out and do like a couple spots 

1919
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:13,300
here and there,
like exhausting timewise.

1920
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:15,250
Yeah,
it's just like nine hours,

1921
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:17,770
10 hours and you're just pitching jokes 
all day long.

1922
01:24:17,771 --> 01:24:18,840
And it's like,
you know,

1923
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,640
for me I do a bunch of the voices on the
show.

1924
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,820
So I'm pitching for myself,
I'm pitching for my,

1925
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,510
you know,
all the other characters.

1926
01:24:25,511 --> 01:24:27,340
And you're just,
at any given moment,

1927
01:24:27,341 --> 01:24:28,750
you're watching,
you're writing,

1928
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:32,080
you're breaking in episode,
you're rewriting another episode,

1929
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:36,430
you're giving notes on a radio play of 
an just the audio,

1930
01:24:36,431 --> 01:24:40,760
you're giving notes on a the animatic 
screening that's coming black,

1931
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:41,793
which is like the black and white kind 
of rough draft and you're giving notes 

1932
01:24:44,411 --> 01:24:48,760
on a color screening that's come back 
from Korea from like six months ago.

1933
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,300
So you're kind of at any given moment 
your rewrite,

1934
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:53,860
especially when you're in the middle of 
the season,

1935
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:55,810
you're just,
you're just kind of,

1936
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,220
you're just,
yeah,

1937
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,320
you're just given your,
your rewrite.

1938
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:02,340
It's the beauty of animation to that.
You just keep getting fucking,

1939
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,393
you know,
figure stuff out when something's not 

1940
01:25:05,441 --> 01:25:06,820
working or just keep,
you know,

1941
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:10,420
it's the,
it's good for that kind of perfectionist

1942
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:12,190
Polisher of like what you're talking 
about,

1943
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:13,390
where you like,
you're like,

1944
01:25:13,391 --> 01:25:14,224
what's not working?
You keep getting it figured out what's 

1945
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:16,720
not working,
you know,

1946
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:18,610
versus like live action where you're 
like,

1947
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:20,350
I hope I got it.
You know,

1948
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:24,160
it's gotta be that's incredibly time 
consuming and it must be exhausting.

1949
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:25,870
It,
it Kinda is.

1950
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:27,730
It's at the end of the day,
you're like,

1951
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:29,380
am I going to go ahead and do a spot 
now?

1952
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:30,670
Yeah,
I dunno.

1953
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,200
I mean I think there's a balance,
right?

1954
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,033
Like you can't burn yourself out too 
much because then you won't have the 

1955
01:25:35,351 --> 01:25:38,440
jokes for the next day.
You'll be too fried.

1956
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:40,870
You gotta pace yourself.
I mean everybody works differently.

1957
01:25:40,871 --> 01:25:44,380
Our pacing is pretty good that like 
you're,

1958
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:46,060
you're,
you're.

1959
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:47,980
Yeah.
I mean there are certain times where I'm

1960
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:48,431
like,
Ooh,

1961
01:25:48,431 --> 01:25:50,320
I feel cooked,
but it's like anything else where you're

1962
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:53,050
like,
you train your brain in that space where

1963
01:25:53,051 --> 01:25:54,600
you're like,
the first two weeks you come home,

1964
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:55,463
your brain is exhausted at the end of 
the night and then two weeks in you're 

1965
01:25:58,661 --> 01:25:59,494
like,
oh,

1966
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,480
okay.
I got my endurance back up.

1967
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,890
Like I can do that.
I can do that nine hour day.

1968
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,130
Did

1969
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:04,963
you.
What did you do to keep your energy 

1970
01:26:07,551 --> 01:26:10,420
level during the day?
Did you take any nootropics are doing.

1971
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:12,860
It would actually be curious because I 
get,

1972
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:16,820
I get hammered at like 2:30
PM.

1973
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:20,180
I want a nap and I can't and I'm,
but I'm like,

1974
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:21,043
I'm not thinking or acting like you are.
So I'm like coffee in the morning and 

1975
01:26:25,251 --> 01:26:26,084
then um,
you know,

1976
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:28,410
and then I crashed and I eat sugar and 
then I thought,

1977
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:29,490
crap.
I'm like,

1978
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:33,680
I don't know what I'm supposed to be.
I'll take any,

1979
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,540
any advice you got.
I would say

1980
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:38,070
the sugar part is the biggest thing you 
should get rid of.

1981
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,313
Yeah.
That's the thing that makes it crashed 

1982
01:26:40,051 --> 01:26:41,950
the hardest to greet and donuts and 
shit.

1983
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:45,000
They taste delicious,
but you,

1984
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:47,830
your body has a really hard time 
processing that shit.

1985
01:26:47,831 --> 01:26:48,664
And afterwards you just bull.
Like the other day I was in Vegas and 

1986
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,210
because it was a on a Sunday,
I was like,

1987
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:55,090
ah,
fuck it man.

1988
01:26:55,091 --> 01:26:56,830
I'll just have some pancakes or 
something like that.

1989
01:26:56,831 --> 01:27:01,180
So I had crepes and I had um,
this yogurt with all this.

1990
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,480
It was like,
you know,

1991
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:06,630
now like yogurt with fruit in it and 
shed and uh,

1992
01:27:06,631 --> 01:27:09,610
had a.
oh and I had two cupcakes or to,

1993
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:10,533
to uh,
to donuts because they had homemade 

1994
01:27:12,731 --> 01:27:14,050
donuts at the hotel.
Like,

1995
01:27:14,051 --> 01:27:14,884
all right,
call,

1996
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:15,783
I'll get a couple of days.
I felt like dog shit for the next six 

1997
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:19,960
hours.
I was just like,

1998
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:23,020
oh yeah.
I felt like I had been drugged.

1999
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:24,093
Like I was exhausted.
Your body's probably truly not used to 

2000
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:30,370
like I've trained my customer to it,
so yeah.

2001
01:27:30,371 --> 01:27:31,204
But I think there's a certain amount of 
you get accustomed to that terrible 

2002
01:27:33,821 --> 01:27:36,670
feeling and it's just the normal feeling
you have after you eat.

2003
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:40,630
But even after like even let's say I 
have like a Greens and protein lunch,

2004
01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:41,483
like where I'm like fuck it,
I'm having a salad with chicken and or 

2005
01:27:42,731 --> 01:27:46,840
something like that.
Still I just hit that like my body wants

2006
01:27:46,841 --> 01:27:50,260
15 minutes to close its eyes at like 
2:30

2007
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:51,093
PM.
Whatever is happening on the couch in 

2008
01:27:52,571 --> 01:27:53,650
your office.
We'll do that.

2009
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:55,120
Yeah.
I need to schedule that.

2010
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:57,340
I need to schedule better into the day.
It'd be like,

2011
01:27:57,341 --> 01:27:58,174
Hey guys,
I'm walking away right now because 

2012
01:27:59,231 --> 01:28:02,260
that's all it needs is like 15 minutes.
But are like,

2013
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:03,220
what?
What is the,

2014
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,600
is it just a,
what is it like?

2015
01:28:04,601 --> 01:28:05,434
Is it a,

2016
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:07,390
you have different companies that make 
them.

2017
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:08,493
What they are is essentially the 
building blocks for human 

2018
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:12,350
neurotransmitter's.
There's a,

2019
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:16,480
there's a gummies like powder most of 
the time.

2020
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:19,510
Either you take them in capsule form or 
you,

2021
01:28:19,511 --> 01:28:20,690
uh,
you drink it.

2022
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:26,040
Here's a good company that uh,
that makes one called a neuro one.

2023
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,870
I really liked that one because it's got
caffeine in it too.

2024
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:31,480
Um,
and then there's another one called true

2025
01:28:31,481 --> 01:28:33,400
brain.
That's a good one.

2026
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:37,420
My company makes one called Alpha brain.
That's my favorite one,

2027
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:38,613
not just because it's my company,
but I think we did the best job of 

2028
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,990
putting ingredients in that work 
synergistically.

2029
01:28:43,991 --> 01:28:47,560
But I'd take a neuro one a lot.
I liked that one a lot.

2030
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:49,530
How do you,
how do you take it during the ticket?

2031
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:50,700
In a shake.
I just,

2032
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:53,550
I just mix it with water in the morning,
like,

2033
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:57,730
or just whenever you need it.
Whenever I'll take it before a workout.

2034
01:28:57,731 --> 01:29:00,040
I'll take it before a podcast.
It'll take.

2035
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:04,000
I take Alpha before every UFC.
Yeah.

2036
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:05,283
What it is is it helps you.
It's been clinically proven through two 

2037
01:29:07,921 --> 01:29:08,754
double blind placebo controlled studies 
at Boston Center from memory that it 

2038
01:29:11,851 --> 01:29:15,450
increases verbal memory,
like your ability to find the right word

2039
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:16,900
for a sentence,
uh,

2040
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,540
increases your reaction time.

2041
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,460
Sure.
When you're doing the UFC shit,

2042
01:29:20,461 --> 01:29:22,020
you just have to be ready to.
Yeah.

2043
01:29:22,021 --> 01:29:24,010
There's just no,
there's no live.

2044
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:27,600
Yeah.
And I'm recounting thousands of fights,

2045
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:32,160
like if you hear me talk and I don't use
notes really.

2046
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:33,263
I mean I have some notes in front of me 
that like I'll get a guy's record or 

2047
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,240
seven and now especially guys that I 
haven't seen fight too many times.

2048
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:41,650
There's a few things that I'd like to 
just arrest events,

2049
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:43,230
like almost if it's all in the back of 
my head.

2050
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:46,860
So I'm recounting a thousand plus.

2051
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:49,560
Do you have,
has your memory always been like that

2052
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:51,200
for fights?
For fights?

2053
01:29:51,201 --> 01:29:53,160
Are fights in certain things for 
certain,

2054
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:54,093
for certain things,
but like my wife will tell me something 

2055
01:29:56,001 --> 01:29:57,480
in like an hour later.
I'm like,

2056
01:29:57,510 --> 01:29:58,670
what?
You told me that?

2057
01:29:58,930 --> 01:29:59,780
And she like,
she's like,

2058
01:29:59,781 --> 01:30:00,980
I just fucking told you that.

2059
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:01,891
Well I was.
Yeah,

2060
01:30:01,891 --> 01:30:03,670
I was having a conversation with a 
friend recently.

2061
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:05,890
It was like,
it was like,

2062
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:09,430
well I remember that your friend is 
Brazilian,

2063
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:14,460
but I have no idea where I was in April.
Yeah,

2064
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:18,880
it's like I don't know what that is now.
I don't know if my memory was bad.

2065
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:19,773
Like I also with the show,
luckily my partners are great detail 

2066
01:30:23,261 --> 01:30:24,520
oriented.
Like I,

2067
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,000
I'm like improvising in the room writing
blah blah blah blah.

2068
01:30:28,001 --> 01:30:29,060
And I like,
I don't,

2069
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:32,190
I don't want to type anything.
I just want to like belittle a verbal.

2070
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:33,063
It's just all verbal and then I'll like 
watch a cut of the show and I'll have 

2071
01:30:39,490 --> 01:30:42,370
almost no memory of what I've said.
And then I'm like,

2072
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,233
oh that was funny.
I'll have no memory of where it came 

2073
01:30:45,701 --> 01:30:46,660
from,
where it came from,

2074
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:48,910
nothing.
And then I'll watch it and be like,

2075
01:30:48,911 --> 01:30:50,110
okay great,
we'll figure it out.

2076
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:54,370
But like it just seems to be the way and
I don't know if that's what I've done to

2077
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:56,260
my brain or that's just the way it is.

2078
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:57,223
I think the funny people,
a lot of times they think and sort of 

2079
01:30:59,491 --> 01:31:03,960
that abstract way and that usually 
doesn't lend itself to the best memory.

2080
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:06,180
It's sort of a wild,
loose,

2081
01:31:06,181 --> 01:31:09,890
impulsive,
abstract quality that in my opinion,

2082
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:12,990
the my friends,
the funniest friends that I have sort of

2083
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:14,580
have that thing going on.

2084
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:17,220
We write your job.
Do you write your jokes ahead of time?

2085
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:17,750
Do you need.
I do

2086
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:21,170
now.
I've been doing that over the last maybe

2087
01:31:21,171 --> 01:31:23,510
four or five years have changed what I 
do,

2088
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:24,643
but I used to do is I would have things 
that I wrote down in notebooks and I 

2089
01:31:27,621 --> 01:31:28,454
would write a little bit on a computer,
but maybe four or five years ago I got 

2090
01:31:32,150 --> 01:31:34,790
a.
became very diligent with my writing and

2091
01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:35,624
so I write out,
I'll write and rewrite and do it all 

2092
01:31:39,501 --> 01:31:41,920
over again.
Start it from scratch and then go,

2093
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:43,161
yeah,
sorry.

2094
01:31:43,161 --> 01:31:43,730
Go ahead.
Know,

2095
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:44,563
and then.
Then I put it into a thing called 

2096
01:31:45,351 --> 01:31:46,910
scrivener,
scrivener.

2097
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:49,550
You ever use that?
I mean I know it is what I'm using.

2098
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:54,460
I use that so I could switch it to the 
lefthand side or it's a.

2099
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:55,333
all the column is all the different 
subjects and then I can move them 

2100
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,940
around.
I can put this one first,

2101
01:32:00,941 --> 01:32:01,774
that one second,
and then when I click on each one that 

2102
01:32:03,281 --> 01:32:07,570
it takes me to all of the shit that I've
written on that particular subject.

2103
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:10,470
I've just found that it makes a big 
difference in my.

2104
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:14,530
My output quality material.
Like how much stuff.

2105
01:32:14,531 --> 01:32:16,180
That's good.
Taglines.

2106
01:32:16,181 --> 01:32:17,920
I never forget the taglines anymore.

2107
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:19,003
[inaudible].
Are you visually seeing when you're 

2108
01:32:19,891 --> 01:32:22,500
onstage or you're visually seeing the 
tagline in your head?

2109
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:25,440
Yeah.
What I do with onstage,

2110
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:28,090
what the thing that I do before I go on 
stage,

2111
01:32:28,091 --> 01:32:28,924
like that day,
usually within a couple of hours of 

2112
01:32:31,451 --> 01:32:34,570
performing,
I write things out in a notebook.

2113
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,880
If you look at my notebook,
it's like all work.

2114
01:32:36,881 --> 01:32:38,790
No play makes jack a dull boy.
Oh work.

2115
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:41,830
I say I write the same thing over and 
over again,

2116
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,980
like 40 pages because it's just a memory
book.

2117
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:45,843
Yes.
I should call it a memory book rather 

2118
01:32:46,631 --> 01:32:48,400
than a notebook.
It's very little of it.

2119
01:32:48,401 --> 01:32:50,760
Is actual writing.
Most of it is just like,

2120
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:54,730
I just want to make sure that I write 
down all the beats to whatever bit.

2121
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:55,683
Yes,

2122
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:56,600
yes.
I,

2123
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:57,733
I've never found an organizational 
method that I like and can stick to in 

2124
01:33:01,041 --> 01:33:02,150
that way.
Like my,

2125
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,313
my shit is like,
there's like my little notebooks that 

2126
01:33:05,601 --> 01:33:06,140
are like,
you know,

2127
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:06,973
my little that you carry up and I'm 
putting on stage with a set list and 

2128
01:33:09,771 --> 01:33:10,604
then I've got ideas in my phone and then
I've got another bigger notebook with 

2129
01:33:13,911 --> 01:33:14,744
some more writing in it.
And then I got shit on a computer but 

2130
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:19,340
none of it's centralized.
None of it's like an eye.

2131
01:33:19,341 --> 01:33:21,800
And I'm like.
But [inaudible] I also think of like,

2132
01:33:21,801 --> 01:33:24,800
if I sit down and write a joke,
I then delivered that night.

2133
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,790
It doesn't ever feel like how,
I dunno,

2134
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:27,430
I don't.

2135
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:28,263
It just takes work.
If you just try to ride it out the way 

2136
01:33:31,151 --> 01:33:31,984
you're going to say it on stage,
it will come off clunky but eventually 

2137
01:33:34,271 --> 01:33:35,740
you'll get it.
But the,

2138
01:33:35,741 --> 01:33:36,574
the difference to me is if I just write 
in my head and then go on stage and I 

2139
01:33:41,651 --> 01:33:44,950
have a good premise and I work it out 
and it turns into a bit and as long as I

2140
01:33:44,951 --> 01:33:46,210
do it a lot,
I memorize it.

2141
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:51,660
That usually does work,
but it's better if I write it out and do

2142
01:33:52,661 --> 01:33:54,760
that.
It's better if I do both things.

2143
01:33:55,570 --> 01:33:56,403
I still give myself a lot of room on 
stage to fuck around and I will just 

2144
01:34:00,851 --> 01:34:04,810
take a premise and run with it onstage.
But if I have a bit now,

2145
01:34:04,811 --> 01:34:09,811
I don't allow myself to not sit in front
of the screen and just write,

2146
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,160
write that bit.
Like if there's a bit on,

2147
01:34:12,161 --> 01:34:13,180
like I said,
bottled water.

2148
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:14,023
If there's a bit on bottled water,
I will write that bit out and I will 

2149
01:34:17,111 --> 01:34:21,520
write it again and I'll read it again 
and I'll just open up Microsoft word and

2150
01:34:21,521 --> 01:34:23,020
start from scratch.
I'll say,

2151
01:34:23,021 --> 01:34:25,570
okay,
let's just start that bit over again.

2152
01:34:25,571 --> 01:34:27,670
Let's see what it is.
Maybe if I just did it today,

2153
01:34:27,671 --> 01:34:28,720
would I do it any differently?

2154
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:31,030
Think you've got to leave that time to 
do that.

2155
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:32,430
Yeah,
you have to.

2156
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:34,740
I really feel like there's a lot of 
people that say,

2157
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:35,760
oh,
right on stage.

2158
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:37,050
Okay.
I run on stage too,

2159
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:41,520
but I feel like if I write on stage and 
I ride in a computer,

2160
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:43,200
it's better.
Yeah.

2161
01:34:43,201 --> 01:34:45,630
I feel like my writing's better.
My bits are.

2162
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:46,950
They have more depth to them.

2163
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:47,900
Yeah.
Well you're,

2164
01:34:47,901 --> 01:34:51,030
you're taking the time to actually think
about it and then leaving your self that

2165
01:34:51,031 --> 01:34:51,230
route.

2166
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:52,970
That's what it is.
It's the time.

2167
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,970
It's the time and the focus,
the amount of time thinking about it.

2168
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,920
That's what I can't.
That's what I liked.

2169
01:34:57,970 --> 01:34:59,390
Especially when I'm on the show.
I'm just like,

2170
01:34:59,391 --> 01:35:02,260
that time is not there,
but I'm like,

2171
01:35:02,350 --> 01:35:03,320
it's.
You got to decide.

2172
01:35:03,321 --> 01:35:04,750
I feel like it's just like whatever 
you're doing,

2173
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:06,300
you're going to fucking jump in and do 
it or not.

2174
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,090
Whatever it is.
Well,

2175
01:35:08,091 --> 01:35:08,924
that's one of the reasons I like 
podcasts so much because I'm fucking 

2176
01:35:11,151 --> 01:35:11,984
lazy and you don't have to do anything.
Just show up and start talking like you 

2177
01:35:15,081 --> 01:35:15,914
and I just talked.
I mean we've already been talking for 

2178
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:19,760
fucking two hours.
He just start talking.

2179
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:21,230
Yeah,
that's it.

2180
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:22,333
But it's interesting like people are 
happy to have that digests it in this 

2181
01:35:26,181 --> 01:35:27,520
format right now.
Yeah.

2182
01:35:27,710 --> 01:35:30,170
But do you think you could get away with
this onstage?

2183
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:31,230
No.
Yeah,

2184
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:32,203
I mean you could do a podcast on stage 
if they knew they were coming to see a 

2185
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:35,780
live podcast,
they would enjoy it.

2186
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:37,250
Right.
And people do enjoy it,

2187
01:35:37,251 --> 01:35:39,900
but it becomes.
Have you done live podcasts?

2188
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:40,730
Weird.
Right.

2189
01:35:40,730 --> 01:35:41,563
It's weird.
Especially if it's like kind of just to 

2190
01:35:43,581 --> 01:35:44,960
chat,
you know what I mean?

2191
01:35:44,961 --> 01:35:46,220
Like if it's like,
yeah,

2192
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:48,620
I feel like I'm ripping these people 
off.

2193
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:50,090
I agree.
I agree.

2194
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:50,924
Unless there's like a specific.
Like we're like I've done my buddy's 

2195
01:35:53,391 --> 01:35:56,040
podcasts,
like a men's Zucker's,

2196
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:57,860
Paul Scheer and June Raphael have a 
podcast.

2197
01:35:57,861 --> 01:35:58,694
Like how did this get made where they 
talk about shitty movies and then they 

2198
01:36:01,041 --> 01:36:01,874
like,
they.

2199
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:02,850
Yeah.
And then,

2200
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:06,170
and then you do that live and the 
audience has been told what the movie is

2201
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:10,130
and then we get up there and we fuck 
around and that feels like everybody.

2202
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:11,990
There's a.
But there is like a pro,

2203
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:15,260
it's not just a pure fuck around,
there's a structure,

2204
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:16,103
there's a structure to it that I feel 
like in a live audience loves and 

2205
01:36:19,011 --> 01:36:20,750
deserves,
like they're psyched about it.

2206
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:22,310
They also know what they're getting in 
that case.

2207
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:25,310
But I agree.
Just like us shooting the shit on stage.

2208
01:36:25,311 --> 01:36:26,144
It's like people paid real money.
They want to see something that feels 

2209
01:36:28,101 --> 01:36:29,380
more.
Jeff,

2210
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:32,630
you and I were having this conversation.
There's 2000 people to our right.

2211
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,780
It would be very fucking strange.
I'd be like,

2212
01:36:35,781 --> 01:36:36,870
sorry,
folks will do.

2213
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,060
Is Weird.
Like we're on.

2214
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:41,300
We're seeing this is on youtube right 
now.

2215
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:43,160
Yeah.
So yeah.

2216
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,230
Hi Guys.
Hi everybody.

2217
01:36:45,570 --> 01:36:46,403
Hey.
Hey,

2218
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:50,120
no more than 2000.
But this.

2219
01:36:50,121 --> 01:36:52,640
Um,
the thing about being in the presence of

2220
01:36:52,641 --> 01:36:54,830
those people is what makes it odd.
Yes,

2221
01:36:54,831 --> 01:36:56,150
I agree.
Well that's the same.

2222
01:36:56,151 --> 01:36:59,480
It's weirdly kind of what I'm saying 
about when we were doing.

2223
01:36:59,481 --> 01:37:00,500
Oh hello.
Which is like,

2224
01:37:00,501 --> 01:37:02,320
we're not going to acknowledge these 
fucking people out there.

2225
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:05,690
You know what I mean?
Let's let them know what we're doing it.

2226
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:09,420
That's the cool thing about that.
You guys wrote it yourself and you don't

2227
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,680
have to adhere to,
you know,

2228
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:14,900
there's not a producer that stick to 
this ancient script.

2229
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:15,800
Yeah,
yeah.

2230
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:17,040
There's not some like,
uh,

2231
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:18,530
like assistant director come in and be 
like,

2232
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:21,200
Hi Mathias.
Thinks that you guys should be,

2233
01:37:21,201 --> 01:37:23,600
um,
you noticed that you changed this word.

2234
01:37:23,601 --> 01:37:27,410
Like that was what always drove me crazy
was like on set where you're like,

2235
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,540
I know.
Especially now where I'm like,

2236
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,220
when they wouldn't let you change a 
word.

2237
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:32,750
And I'm like,
I get it.

2238
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:34,760
You wrote a great joke.
Absolutely.

2239
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:36,770
But I also know I've been in a writer's 
room.

2240
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:41,270
I know that we wrote that joke three 
months ago fucking ready for lunch.

2241
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:42,373
Like this isn't some,
this isn't Mozart didn't write some 

2242
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,470
perfect song that required.
It's like,

2243
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:51,200
you know,
like I respect your process,

2244
01:37:51,201 --> 01:37:55,410
but also respect that you wrote this 
three months ago and we were not in room

2245
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:56,070
and you were not

2246
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:56,903
with this.
Like we are now in this particular 

2247
01:37:58,261 --> 01:38:01,860
situation on this day.
So let's also realize that that.

2248
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:03,023
And I accept that when I write for other
people that like whatever I was trying 

2249
01:38:06,271 --> 01:38:08,730
to do in that room,
let's try to get that.

2250
01:38:08,731 --> 01:38:12,780
But let's also acknowledge where we are 
in this new moment.

2251
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:13,703
You know?
Yeah.

2252
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:14,663
That was one of the more amazing things 
about working with Paul Simms on news 

2253
01:38:17,781 --> 01:38:22,500
radio is that he allowed you to rewrite 
entire scenes.

2254
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:23,730
And I've really.
Yeah.

2255
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:24,683
Dave Foley was really like a secret 
producer of that show is Dave Foley is 

2256
01:38:28,801 --> 01:38:31,320
such a brilliant writer.
What would he would do is like,

2257
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:35,520
there would be a scene that wouldn't 
work and he would sit back and be like,

2258
01:38:35,521 --> 01:38:38,100
okay,
why does it,

2259
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:39,073
how about it?
Vicky comes in and she introduces this 

2260
01:38:42,121 --> 01:38:44,910
and then more comes in like here and 
then he will,

2261
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,580
he will have like a totally different 
thing and he'll say,

2262
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:48,600
depaul,
like,

2263
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:51,150
I,
we have a new thing for you.

2264
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:52,920
Tell us what you think.
Paul will go,

2265
01:38:52,921 --> 01:38:54,030
love it,
keep it.

2266
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:57,020
And that you guys.
That was in rehearsals leading up to it.

2267
01:38:57,021 --> 01:38:58,680
But I think that that's,
to me,

2268
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,770
the best creators and see are.
I mean,

2269
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:04,200
I think there are some like,
aw tour geniuses,

2270
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:09,620
but I think for the firm in general,
the best people are the ones who are ego

2271
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,550
is enough in check that they can be 
like,

2272
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:17,460
I've brought you in to collaborate with 
me.

2273
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:18,713
Let's hear what you have to say because 
it might be better and it'll make me 

2274
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:23,460
equally look good.
Nobody knows.

2275
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:27,660
Nobody knows that it's going to still 
say like Paul Simms created the show.

2276
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,820
Nobody's going to know that Foley did,
uh,

2277
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:30,600
did,
uh,

2278
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,520
interesting.
Like rewrite on a rehearsal.

2279
01:39:32,521 --> 01:39:36,420
I think Paul would even tell you.
But the thing about it was that when you

2280
01:39:36,421 --> 01:39:38,340
write something out,
just like we were talking about before,

2281
01:39:38,341 --> 01:39:39,174
if you write jokes,
they don't come to live unless there's 

2282
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:42,383
people there.

2283
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:44,310
They come to life when you're actually 
performing.

2284
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:45,144
Yeah.
Like a joke just doesn't exist in a 

2285
01:39:47,431 --> 01:39:48,450
vacuum.
They,

2286
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:50,690
they've really.
You really need an audience.

2287
01:39:50,691 --> 01:39:52,440
Yes.
The thing about Ra,

2288
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:57,500
there's a similar process involved in a 
sitcom in that as you're running through

2289
01:39:59,131 --> 01:39:59,964
it,
then it comes to life and then you 

2290
01:40:01,681 --> 01:40:06,150
realize the clunky part or you realize a
better way to get to it or you realize,

2291
01:40:06,151 --> 01:40:06,984
well this is the joke.
The joke is that he doesn't know this 

2292
01:40:08,830 --> 01:40:11,520
and that this has happened,
so why don't we have it this way?

2293
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:13,370
And you're like,
ah,

2294
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:14,521
yeah,
yeah,

2295
01:40:14,521 --> 01:40:15,331
we,
I mean,

2296
01:40:15,331 --> 01:40:17,430
that's how we,
we do the show,

2297
01:40:17,431 --> 01:40:20,070
you know,
we have a fucking killer writer's room.

2298
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:23,460
We will break stories together.
Someone goes off and writes a script,

2299
01:40:23,461 --> 01:40:26,910
comes back and then we'll rewrite the 
whole script in the room.

2300
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:27,941
And I,
and I,

2301
01:40:27,941 --> 01:40:30,360
I don't know if other rooms,
I don't know how other rooms work,

2302
01:40:30,361 --> 01:40:31,194
but like we'll read,
we'll read every scene together in the 

2303
01:40:34,291 --> 01:40:35,124
room just to hear it out loud and then 
rewrite it based on like what we all 

2304
01:40:38,911 --> 01:40:39,744
just laughed at or didn't laugh at.
And so by the time we're actually 

2305
01:40:41,701 --> 01:40:44,670
getting the table read where we're 
hearing it again,

2306
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:47,190
out loud,
even before we get there,

2307
01:40:47,191 --> 01:40:49,860
we've read,
we've read it all out loud and put it on

2308
01:40:49,861 --> 01:40:52,950
its feet five times before it's even 
getting hurt in that,

2309
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:54,130
you know,
what's the grossest

2310
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:56,590
thing of all time?
The fake laugh at the table.

2311
01:40:56,591 --> 01:41:01,591
Read the fake writers left as you're 
performing,

2312
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,050
you feel like a dirty whore and you hear
they're fake laugh.

2313
01:41:08,051 --> 01:41:08,884
I know because they're just trying to 
sell their show to the networks and the 

2314
01:41:11,561 --> 01:41:13,470
networks all skeptical.
Hippo face like,

2315
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:16,840
oh this fucking piece of shit.
You guys are selling.

2316
01:41:16,841 --> 01:41:20,050
Caught the tail end of the fucking sweet
spot.

2317
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,850
Yeah,
the tail end of the Sitcom era.

2318
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:25,310
You really got you guys.
I mean with.

2319
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:26,393
It was a great show.
It's amazing that there's really no 

2320
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:29,974
sitcoms anymore.
I mean there was the fucking science 

2321
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:36,030
one.
What does that Big Bang theory.

2322
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:38,410
So one last year.
That's amazing.

2323
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:41,110
It's crazy.
That was the first show that I was going

2324
01:41:41,111 --> 01:41:41,944
to test for.
Like that was the first like thing that 

2325
01:41:44,201 --> 01:41:46,690
they were like,
we want to fly to la to test for this.

2326
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:48,040
And I was like,
ah,

2327
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:50,350
I don't think they weren't offering much
money.

2328
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:52,360
They weren't offering a ton of money,
so I was like,

2329
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:53,560
eh.
Even then,

2330
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:54,483
and by the way,
that shows not bad and those guys will 

2331
01:41:56,531 --> 01:41:59,890
never have to work again ever.
But I just like,

2332
01:42:00,730 --> 01:42:02,950
I don't want to be locked into any.
I want to fucking do.

2333
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:05,170
I want to do new stuff.
I want to fuck around.

2334
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:05,950
Yeah.
I just,

2335
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:07,150
my.
We're stuck on that.

2336
01:42:07,151 --> 01:42:08,320
Yeah.
And again,

2337
01:42:08,321 --> 01:42:09,910
those guys,
God bless him.

2338
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:11,450
Yeah.
How long did you guys do?

2339
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:14,470
Or was it five years,
but it was never a success.

2340
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,611
It wasn't.
No,

2341
01:42:15,611 --> 01:42:17,260
no,
it bombed every year.

2342
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:20,410
My friend Lou Martin was one of the 
know.

2343
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:21,563
Yeah.
He used to wear a t shirt every Monday 

2344
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:27,820
of what our ratings were and showed up 
on the set one day and it said like 88.

2345
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:29,380
And I went no fucking ways.

2346
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:30,310
That really goes,
Yep,

2347
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:31,760
we're number 88.
I went,

2348
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:34,150
oh my God,
but by the way,

2349
01:42:34,151 --> 01:42:38,500
whatever that number was then would now 
be a fucking monster hit.

2350
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:39,393
Oh,
the numbers that we would get in in 

2351
01:42:40,781 --> 01:42:43,030
terms of viewers would be huge.
Yeah,

2352
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:44,530
a huge hit.
Yeah.

2353
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:47,860
In comparison it would be the now will 
be dead in the water and now it would be

2354
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:50,980
a huge hit and I'd be psyched,
but then there was the sweet spot then,

2355
01:42:50,981 --> 01:42:53,290
which is like between friends and 
Seinfeld.

2356
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:55,780
That was the sweet spot and if you could
get into that.

2357
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:57,670
Oh sweet baby.
Jesus,

2358
01:42:57,671 --> 01:42:59,410
you are fucking.
You've made it baby.

2359
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:03,540
There was the caroline in the city guy.
Suddenly.

2360
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:04,540
Susan.
Yeah.

2361
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:08,920
They kept trying to these shit what Paul
Simms would call these shit sandwiches.

2362
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:10,023
We have these really good shows that 
these slabs are shit and between them 

2363
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:13,953
they were fucking terrible,
terrible shows and they went on for a 

2364
01:43:16,661 --> 01:43:17,494
long time when they were big hits,
but even in syndication there dead like 

2365
01:43:20,411 --> 01:43:22,060
nobody wants to watch them.
Maybe.

2366
01:43:22,061 --> 01:43:24,340
I'm trying to think if I watch news 
radio and syndication,

2367
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:28,390
that's probably how you watched it.
It became a hit after the fact.

2368
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,220
That was the craziest thing about the 
show.

2369
01:43:30,221 --> 01:43:31,054
The show became popular after it was 
canceled because it was on reruns on 

2370
01:43:34,781 --> 01:43:35,614
whatever.
Everyone who was attached to so much 

2371
01:43:36,671 --> 01:43:39,340
controversial because Phil Hartman was 
murdered and you know,

2372
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:42,300
before the final season.
Yeah,

2373
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:45,090
it was all so much.
Was that weird?

2374
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:46,420
Crazy.
I mean,

2375
01:43:46,421 --> 01:43:49,810
that must have been the saddest,
most tense thing in the world.

2376
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:51,710
That was,
that was

2377
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:53,103
it.
Well,

2378
01:43:53,530 --> 01:43:54,363
it taught me a lot.
First of all taught me do not stay in 

2379
01:43:57,531 --> 01:44:01,310
one of those evil relationships because 
there's people that just,

2380
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:02,503
they just don't work together and they 
try to make it work together and you 

2381
01:44:05,931 --> 01:44:08,840
went to fucking hating each other and 
that was him and her.

2382
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,793
It was ugly and I tried to get him to 
divorce her several times and he was 

2383
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:17,270
terrified of losing his image.
Terrified of losing money.

2384
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:18,223
I mean,
he just didn't want to be a divorced 

2385
01:44:18,951 --> 01:44:21,740
Hollywood bachelor guy.
His image was the family guy,

2386
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:24,200
you know,
I'm a married man,

2387
01:44:24,201 --> 01:44:25,580
family guy.
Everything's great.

2388
01:44:25,581 --> 01:44:28,250
Everything about him is like,
I look like a nice man.

2389
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:29,111
Yes.
Yeah,

2390
01:44:29,111 --> 01:44:30,770
yeah,
exactly the funniest,

2391
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,290
but he was living in hell.
It was awful.

2392
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:34,353
Yeah.
She would like openly insulting him at 

2393
01:44:35,871 --> 01:44:40,070
parties and stuff and we would just 
cringe like toxic.

2394
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:41,630
She hated him,
you know,

2395
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:43,670
and she wound up shooting him in his 
sleep.

2396
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:47,030
I mean it was,
it was so intense.

2397
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:48,343
As ugly as it gets.
I mean he took like a Nyquil or 

2398
01:44:51,411 --> 01:44:52,244
something like that to go to sleep and 
she shot him in the head while he was 

2399
01:44:54,111 --> 01:44:55,180
sleeping.
She had.

2400
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:59,120
How did you guys find out on like a next
day or like how do I.

2401
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:01,400
well,
I found out,

2402
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:05,060
I think I got a phone call.
Yeah,

2403
01:45:05,061 --> 01:45:06,860
that's what it was.
I got a phone call.

2404
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:09,170
This is like pre,
pre cell phone.

2405
01:45:09,171 --> 01:45:11,210
Pre email probably.
Yeah,

2406
01:45:11,211 --> 01:45:14,360
it was 90.
I want to say 98.

2407
01:45:14,990 --> 01:45:17,960
I guess I had a phone but I mean I guess
I had a cell phone,

2408
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:21,880
had a shitty Motorola startac.
Remember those razor they are not having

2409
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,400
there.
Yeah,

2410
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:26,570
about 47 minutes of talk time out of 
battery.

2411
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:28,280
But uh,
yeah,

2412
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:32,040
actually now that I remember I found 
about it to,

2413
01:45:32,041 --> 01:45:32,690
this is crazy.

2414
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:33,523
I found out about it from a girl I'd 
gone on a date with who worked for like 

2415
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:37,183
one of those shows like hard copies that
she called me up and she was trying to 

2416
01:45:39,771 --> 01:45:43,980
send a news crew to my house.
What a nice.

2417
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:45,350
What a nice person.
It's like,

2418
01:45:45,351 --> 01:45:48,290
what the fuck are you talking about to 
interview you?

2419
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,970
We're going to send a crew to your house
or what?

2420
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:52,220
And then um,
and then,

2421
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:54,090
uh,
tuned in the news and there was hell,

2422
01:45:54,170 --> 01:45:55,580
this is what.
It was really weird.

2423
01:45:55,790 --> 01:45:59,840
There was helicopters flying over 
Steve's of Phil's house.

2424
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:00,913
And then there was that guy who was in a
cocoon who was like a really famous 

2425
01:46:04,641 --> 01:46:06,860
actor for awhile,
but he lost his fucking marbles.

2426
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:09,560
Who is that guy that was in a cocoon the
young.

2427
01:46:09,561 --> 01:46:11,150
He was a young,
handsome guy.

2428
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:16,340
Steve Gutenberg know that his name.
I mean the Gutenberg press was him.

2429
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:19,340
Yeah.
That guy lost his mind.

2430
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,210
He lost his mind and he,
um,

2431
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:23,113
his career had fallen apart.
So he had pulled up a photo of Steve 

2432
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:28,970
Gutenberg.
Let me make sure it's him for.

2433
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:35,180
Yeah,
let me see what is that,

2434
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:37,970
what it looks like now,
but back then?

2435
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,890
Yes.
Yes.

2436
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:45,250
So see if you can Google Steve 
Gutenberg.

2437
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:46,993
I'm at Phil Hartman's murder because he 
had decided that he was going to talk 

2438
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:57,810
for a,
to the,

2439
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:01,020
to the police,
talked to CNN.

2440
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,460
Yeah.
Or not to.

2441
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:03,443
He was going to talk to the press.
So he put on like a suit and he got out 

2442
01:47:07,081 --> 01:47:10,590
there and he was,
he was out there talking to,

2443
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:13,140
uh,
to the press and we were all like,

2444
01:47:13,141 --> 01:47:18,141
what the fuck is he doing?
I mean maybe he's fucking,

2445
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:21,450
you don't hear about this guy anymore.
Right?

2446
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:24,900
He kind of vanished,
but he had already vanished back then.

2447
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:26,450
It had already.
It was already like

2448
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:30,600
post all those movies most to the police
academy and all that Shit.

2449
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:31,453
And there's a weird thing that happens 
to some of these guys where they just 

2450
01:47:34,010 --> 01:47:35,240
like,
it's all gone,

2451
01:47:35,241 --> 01:47:35,770
right?

2452
01:47:35,770 --> 01:47:36,730
And then they're like,
oh,

2453
01:47:36,731 --> 01:47:38,770
this is an opportunity for me to get 
back on camera.

2454
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:40,620
And we were all,
all of us were like,

2455
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:42,630
how well did he know Steve Gutenberg?
Like,

2456
01:47:42,631 --> 01:47:45,450
what the fuck is going on?
It was the strangest thing.

2457
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:46,523
Him standing there with a suit on,
talking to all the press and talking to 

2458
01:47:50,041 --> 01:47:52,290
people.
It was so weird.

2459
01:47:52,291 --> 01:47:53,124
I mean maybe I'm wrong and maybe he did 
have this wonderful relationship that 

2460
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:58,800
Phil never talked about,
but I was pretty close to fill.

2461
01:47:58,920 --> 01:47:59,753
But I mean,
I don't know.

2462
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:01,403
I think there's a certain,
there's a certain weirdness to talking 

2463
01:48:04,141 --> 01:48:04,974
to the press about someone who's just 
been murdered and people that are 

2464
01:48:07,201 --> 01:48:12,030
willing to like go on camera and give 
interviews and stuff.

2465
01:48:12,031 --> 01:48:13,650
It's like,
are you morning?

2466
01:48:13,651 --> 01:48:15,240
Aren't you freaked out?
Like aren't you,

2467
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:18,090
I,
I,

2468
01:48:18,830 --> 01:48:21,960
I just was.
This is a slightly changed.

2469
01:48:21,961 --> 01:48:23,640
But it was so.
It was like.

2470
01:48:23,641 --> 01:48:26,610
Do you remember where you were when the 
Oj verdict was written?

2471
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:27,503
I was in high school.
I climbed a tree pledget climate trail 

2472
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:32,753
that other people be like,
where were you when the Oj verdict in a 

2473
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:37,793
tree?

2474
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:38,803
Remember I was with my girlfriend at the
time and she threw her hands on her 

2475
01:48:41,141 --> 01:48:41,950
face.
And went.

2476
01:48:41,950 --> 01:48:44,410
Oh No.
Oh No.

2477
01:48:44,411 --> 01:48:45,880
She's kept saying.
Oh really?

2478
01:48:45,970 --> 01:48:46,803
She just went.
Oh.

2479
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:48,240
Oh No.
Oh No.

2480
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:49,570
Are you in la?
Yeah,

2481
01:48:49,571 --> 01:48:54,571
we were watching it in my apartment.
We were watching the verdict and w and I

2482
01:48:55,301 --> 01:48:57,520
was dumbfounded.
I thought it was going to jail.

2483
01:48:57,521 --> 01:48:59,630
Everybody thought he was going to jail 
and she just,

2484
01:48:59,690 --> 01:49:01,420
she just kept going.
Oh No.

2485
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:03,910
Oh No.
Oh No.

2486
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:05,770
Yeah,
I just remember being in high school.

2487
01:49:06,010 --> 01:49:09,220
I knew Ron Goldman sister to really?
Yeah.

2488
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:10,960
Yeah.
That was real weird.

2489
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:12,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

2490
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:14,170
I knew his sister

2491
01:49:14,290 --> 01:49:18,190
and because also like her,
her Ron Goldman's father and I have no,

2492
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:19,660
like,
I can't imagine.

2493
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:23,710
I can't even begin to fathom what that 
whole experience would be for anyone.

2494
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:27,730
But he was like,
he felt very performative to me.

2495
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:31,930
Like he felt like he,
like he was.

2496
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:34,210
Again,
I say this with all due respect,

2497
01:49:34,211 --> 01:49:35,160
like I don't know what it's,
I have,

2498
01:49:35,161 --> 01:49:37,180
would have no sense of what that 
experience is like.

2499
01:49:37,450 --> 01:49:38,500
But there are certain people that are 
like,

2500
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:39,940
oh,
you do like being on camera.

2501
01:49:39,941 --> 01:49:41,680
I know something horrible happened to 
you,

2502
01:49:41,681 --> 01:49:44,020
but you did like being on camera.
I mean,

2503
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:44,990
I have no idea.

2504
01:49:44,990 --> 01:49:45,890
Yeah,
I don't know either.

2505
01:49:45,891 --> 01:49:46,910
I mean,
who the fuck,

2506
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:48,790
how you know,
how I would react.

2507
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:53,110
Your son was murdered by some superstar.
Like just think about how crazy that is.

2508
01:49:53,111 --> 01:49:53,944
Not just murdered but murdered by a 
famous guy who then is like on off 

2509
01:49:57,700 --> 01:49:59,680
flaunted and got off.
Yeah.

2510
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:00,843
Yeah man.
He was a part of this weird race thing 

2511
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:03,243
where it was post Rodney King.
So there was a lot of people that felt 

2512
01:50:06,041 --> 01:50:06,874
like there was some sort of a racist 
aspect to it that like there was a 

2513
01:50:10,930 --> 01:50:13,930
racist cops who got off with Rodney 
King,

2514
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:18,960
so now it's their chance to get one for 
black folks and talk to people about it,

2515
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:20,740
you know,

2516
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:22,510
it's that cray.
Did you watch the,

2517
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,150
you do watch the Oj,
the documentary.

2518
01:50:25,151 --> 01:50:25,984
And then also there was the fx show 
watch one episode of the Fx show and I 

2519
01:50:29,291 --> 01:50:29,981
was like,
Damn.

2520
01:50:29,981 --> 01:50:33,840
Cuba gooding Jr and fucking nailed it.
He really seemed like Oj in it.

2521
01:50:33,841 --> 01:50:35,170
It was really good.
Yeah.

2522
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:35,790
But that's all.
Well,

2523
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:40,640
the documentary is interesting because 
it sets up like la all like that.

2524
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:43,960
The preceding years leading up to posts,
riots,

2525
01:50:43,961 --> 01:50:46,810
all that stuff like and you're like,
oh,

2526
01:50:46,811 --> 01:50:48,400
it does.
It sort of.

2527
01:50:48,430 --> 01:50:51,100
It does like lend itself to be like,
oh,

2528
01:50:51,101 --> 01:50:51,934
this was,
this was a perfect confluence of events 

2529
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:57,190
that led to this thing of like,
you know,

2530
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:59,810
racial up,
you know,

2531
01:50:59,811 --> 01:51:01,690
all,
everything that went into the Oj trial.

2532
01:51:01,691 --> 01:51:03,370
It's fucking nuts.
It's crazy.

2533
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:04,190
It was a,

2534
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:06,240
a strange,
strange time.

2535
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:07,133
It was a strange time because it just 
seemed like the world was made of 

2536
01:51:09,991 --> 01:51:13,230
something that was way more flexible 
than I ever thought it was before.

2537
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:16,980
Like I never thought Oj Simpson could be
a murderer.

2538
01:51:16,981 --> 01:51:21,720
I thought murderers were bad people and 
that the people that you thought of,

2539
01:51:21,721 --> 01:51:22,554
that we're good people on tv,
you would never think of like Oj was 

2540
01:51:25,351 --> 01:51:26,184
always so friendly and smiley and he 
would have that big laugh and he is 

2541
01:51:31,351 --> 01:51:32,184
handsome.

2542
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:35,550
Talk about head injuries to cte.
It's like you're like,

2543
01:51:35,551 --> 01:51:36,300
oh,
I wonder what?

2544
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:37,070
Oh,
for sure.

2545
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:38,010
Or had to do with it.
Yeah.

2546
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:40,910
One hundred percent,
1000 million percent.

2547
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:41,953
In fact,
his doctor said that if the trial were 

2548
01:51:43,791 --> 01:51:47,630
to take place today,
is Dr the time they would introduce ct?

2549
01:51:47,631 --> 01:51:48,330
Yeah,
yeah,

2550
01:51:48,330 --> 01:51:50,060
yeah.
Can you see all those students?

2551
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:50,953
I mean like the,
the level of violence that there is 

2552
01:51:52,650 --> 01:51:53,483
here.
Yes,

2553
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:54,780
that's right.
Police Academy.

2554
01:51:57,330 --> 01:51:59,770
He's funny in naked gun,
but it's interesting.

2555
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:02,730
You go back and watch that documentary 
and it's like,

2556
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:04,140
you know,
his buddies,

2557
01:52:04,141 --> 01:52:06,330
his like his good buddies who stood by 
him,

2558
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:09,473
his good buddies who stood by him 
talking about him in high school and 

2559
01:52:12,691 --> 01:52:15,700
he's Kinda like he was fucking thrown 
his friends under the bus in school.

2560
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:16,743
Like the,
all three of them would be like doing 

2561
01:52:18,181 --> 01:52:20,940
some like in the bathroom,
like doing some shit.

2562
01:52:20,941 --> 01:52:25,620
They're supposed to be in class and the 
principal would come in and the three of

2563
01:52:25,621 --> 01:52:26,454
them were all together and Oj would 
saddle up next to the principal and be 

2564
01:52:29,191 --> 01:52:30,024
like,
what are we going to do with these two 

2565
01:52:30,841 --> 01:52:32,310
guys?
You know what I mean?

2566
01:52:32,311 --> 01:52:35,010
He was like throwing his buddies under 
the bus.

2567
01:52:35,070 --> 01:52:35,821
You're like,
oh,

2568
01:52:35,821 --> 01:52:36,654
he was CD fucked him up.
I don't know what kind of man he would 

2569
01:52:39,151 --> 01:52:41,580
have been like,
whether he would have been so violent or

2570
01:52:41,581 --> 01:52:42,414
whatever,
but you're like piece of shit plus it 

2571
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:46,250
kind of felt like he was a piece of shit
his whole life.

2572
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:47,480
Well,
how about the book?

2573
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:50,180
If I did it,
how crazy.

2574
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:52,820
How crazy is that?
That he wrote a book?

2575
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:54,690
If I do,
I do identify.

2576
01:52:55,210 --> 01:52:56,850
Did you see that?
Did you ever say.

2577
01:52:56,860 --> 01:52:59,930
Have you ever seen his prank show?
Juiced?

2578
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:03,020

Do you ever see his rap song?
No.

2582
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:09,830
Oh,

2583
01:53:09,831 --> 01:53:12,290
Jamie.
Find it again.

2584
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:13,131
Oh yes,

2585
01:53:13,131 --> 01:53:15,140
This was part of that juiced I think 
thing,

2586
01:53:15,141 --> 01:53:17,300
right?
It's in that same thing and it's part of

2587
01:53:17,301 --> 01:53:17,870
Jen's.
It's like,

2588
01:53:17,870 --> 01:53:21,120

like Nicole,

2590
01:53:23,421 --> 01:53:24,254

What does that picture of him with the 

2591
01:53:25,611 --> 01:53:26,444
glasses that's from one of the sketches.
Look at that crazy one in the fuck is 

2592
01:53:31,791 --> 01:53:33,410
that boy.
He can go anywhere with that.

2593
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,273
You can go to Disneyland here that 
famous and you did something awful like 

2594
01:53:38,511 --> 01:53:39,980
that.
You gotta go in disguise.

2595
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:42,660
How many chicks bang him?
Just because he's Oj now?

2596
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:44,480
A lot.
You think still people.

2597
01:53:44,481 --> 01:53:46,310
Are you still thinking we're going to 
bang him?

2598
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,170
Yes.
One hundred percent.

2599
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:51,110
I know Jay pretended he would.
What?

2600
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:54,440
What does it say it?
This guy tried to hold this guy.

2601
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:56,000
Oh God.
The poor guy.

2602
01:53:56,770 --> 01:53:59,300
Imagine mailman.
I wonder 100 percent.

2603
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:01,133
Yeah.
There's Wacky broads that want to bang 

2604
01:54:02,271 --> 01:54:03,620

Really?

2605
01:54:03,621 --> 01:54:04,454
Yes.
I buy.

2606
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,690
Yeah,
I guess so.

2607
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:07,670
There's,
there's a guy that we had in here,

2608
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:09,190
Nikki Harris,
who uh,

2609
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:10,633
went to jail.
He was on death row for 20 years for a 

2610
01:54:13,341 --> 01:54:14,174
crime that 22 years for a crime they 
didn't commit and he said since getting 

2611
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:18,560
out,
he's just in it.

2612
01:54:18,610 --> 01:54:22,460
He was asking on the podcast with these 
women to stop sending him emails.

2613
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:23,900
Um,
I'm married.

2614
01:54:23,901 --> 01:54:26,720
I have a good relationship.
Like please leave me alone.

2615
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,450
Like stop testing me.
And like,

2616
01:54:29,451 --> 01:54:30,100
really?
Yeah.

2617
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:32,810
They just throw that buzzy.
Interesting.

2618
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:34,550
Yeah.
There's a Richard Ramirez,

2619
01:54:34,551 --> 01:54:35,384
the night stalker,
that guy apparently got all these women 

2620
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:39,673
were sending him pictures and email or 
letters and he might have married some 

2621
01:54:45,381 --> 01:54:46,310
woman.
Really?

2622
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:49,910
Manson's Manson got married.
Yeah.

2623
01:54:49,970 --> 01:54:52,070
A lot of them get married.
Yeah.

2624
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:55,160
Real common.
Fuck man.

2625
01:54:55,310 --> 01:54:56,150
Crazy.
Yeah.

2626
01:54:56,151 --> 01:54:56,984
I mean,
look,

2627
01:54:57,590 --> 01:54:59,230
I'd fuck Oj.
I would too.

2628
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:01,550
I'd fucking with you.
We'd high five each other.

2629
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:05,870
Would you want the front of the back?
I wouldn't want.

2630
01:55:05,930 --> 01:55:10,930
I don't think I'd want the front.
I think I probably more dangerous.

2631
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:13,550
We had a cte like flashback and pick 
your deck off.

2632
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:14,181
Oh,
that's true.

2633
01:55:14,181 --> 01:55:17,220
You could control.
You can control the back a little bit.

2634
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:20,240
Yeah.
I wonder what his teeth did in prison.

2635
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:21,170
He's out now,
right?

2636
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:22,580
Nobody's out.
Yeah.

2637
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:25,270
Which is really weird.
That's wild.

2638
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:27,980
What is Oj doing these days?
He was,

2639
01:55:28,070 --> 01:55:30,890
I can't remember.
What he was doing recently is Jamie.

2640
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:33,000
It's got a good podcast.
I've done his podcast.

2641
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:35,020
I put on my,
um,

2642
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:35,913
my twitter.
Should I interview Oj on my podcast or 

2643
01:55:38,481 --> 01:55:40,710
not?
What was,

2644
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:41,573
what was the response?
Moshe Kasher just sent me a text versus 

2645
01:55:44,001 --> 01:55:49,001
like,
what the fuck would you.

2646
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:52,950
I guess that would legitimize or my 
guests and what an interview with that.

2647
01:55:52,951 --> 01:55:54,990
Legitimize him.
I've heard that before.

2648
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,140
Oj Simpson living life of luxury in 
Vegas.

2649
01:55:58,141 --> 01:55:59,810
Twenty three years.
What year is this?

2650
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:00,690
This was 18.
Oh,

2651
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:02,790
this is just now last week.
Wow.

2652
01:56:02,791 --> 01:56:06,990
He's living a life of luxury in Vegas.
Look at him just walking around.

2653
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:10,560
Strolling plays golf four to five times 
a week and the exclusive,

2654
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:14,940
a royal golf club.
Far from keeping a low profile.

2655
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:16,133
The form of Buffalo Bill Star has been 
spotted and hotels and even a Vegas 

2656
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,420
Golden Knights hockey game.
Wow.

2657
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:24,660
What the fuck?
Look at him.

2658
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:27,140
Look at it again.
Someone young poster.

2659
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:32,220
Look at that girl.
O Lmg people.

2660
01:56:32,221 --> 01:56:33,830
Fuck him.
I guarantee you girls.

2661
01:56:33,831 --> 01:56:35,340
Fuck him.
One hundred percent.

2662
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:36,353
I wonder probably more than us combined.
The Chelsea Hotel Breathalyzer sensor 

2663
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:44,610
reported travels around town with his 
own breathalyzer.

2664
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:47,610
If he exceeds a certain blood alcohol 
level,

2665
01:56:47,730 --> 01:56:51,060
he could be sent back to prison,
so maybe he should just stop drinking.

2666
01:56:51,890 --> 01:56:56,490
Maybe it should just stop.
She enjoys a Martini a day,

2667
01:56:57,030 --> 01:56:57,750
but what does that.

2668
01:56:57,750 --> 01:57:00,470
If he what?
What is the blood alcohol level?

2669
01:57:00,490 --> 01:57:03,060
They're sending you back to prison.
How crazy is that?

2670
01:57:03,110 --> 01:57:05,400
It's free,
but if you have three beers,

2671
01:57:05,401 --> 01:57:08,370
you're fucking shit.
He's on parole I guess.

2672
01:57:08,371 --> 01:57:09,204
Right?
He was anally or the thing that's Colin 

2673
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:13,440
did.
He is at the very end of it.

2674
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,450
He was trying to talk him into saying 
that he did it.

2675
01:57:16,810 --> 01:57:18,840
Yeah.
I think he was.

2676
01:57:19,870 --> 01:57:22,230
Oh,
J was more aware of what was going on.

2677
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,820
Then a bunch of the other people on that
show.

2678
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:27,060
Well,
I mean you'd think he's probably a hyper

2679
01:57:27,061 --> 01:57:28,860
paranoid that someone's fucking with 
him.

2680
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:29,963
Fuck everybody's fucking.
Since always look up more young pussy 

2681
01:57:37,861 --> 01:57:40,380
for Oj.
Oj wanted to meet me.

2682
01:57:40,381 --> 01:57:43,410
My name is Nicole.
He said that's his favorite name.

2683
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:46,800
Oh my God.
That is insane.

2684
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:48,983
But you know what?
I bet he gets a lot of those vacant odd 

2685
01:57:51,481 --> 01:57:56,130
young ladies to accept his penis.
I have trouble believing that.

2686
01:57:56,131 --> 01:57:57,060
Maybe.
I mean,

2687
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,901
why?
Because you think.

2688
01:57:57,901 --> 01:58:00,580
Do you ever.
Do you ever ironically fuck somebody.

2689
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,240
Some gals would do that,
right?

2690
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:05,760
Ironically,
fucking murder.

2691
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:10,560
I guess further can't imagine I maybe,
I can't imagine.

2692
01:58:10,830 --> 01:58:14,640
I don't know what the social like the 
currency of that is.

2693
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:17,370
What Scott Peterson was sent to death 
row in California,

2694
01:58:17,371 --> 01:58:20,010
San Quentin prison for murdering his 
wife and their unborn child.

2695
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:20,873
Dozens of women phoned asking for his 
address with one teenager wasting no 

2696
01:58:24,751 --> 01:58:26,850
time and offering to marry him.
Wow.

2697
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:27,863
Yeah.
There's A.

2698
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:29,003
I think this is what I think.
I think there is some sort of ancient 

2699
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:34,823
DNA that people have that attracts them 
to murderers and conquerors because 

2700
01:58:39,481 --> 01:58:40,314
those are the people that survived and 
the your some sort of a strange 

2701
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:45,693
inclination for some women,
obviously ones that are not thinking 

2702
01:58:49,151 --> 01:58:53,200
clearly,
but for some women to want the sperm and

2703
01:58:53,201 --> 01:58:56,490
the genetics of a murderer because 
that's the type of the.

2704
01:58:56,560 --> 01:59:01,000
If you add a murderous,
brave conqueror for a child,

2705
01:59:01,330 --> 01:59:04,610
that child would survive like that DNA.

2706
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:07,120
Yeah.
I mean I get some sense of survival.

2707
01:59:07,121 --> 01:59:07,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

2708
01:59:07,670 --> 01:59:10,170
I mean in at times of barbaric.
Sure,

2709
01:59:10,570 --> 01:59:12,190
sure.
You want it to be with someone.

2710
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:14,560
Yeah.
That's what I think it is like a killer.

2711
01:59:15,570 --> 01:59:17,890
So much like the caveman comedian.
Well,

2712
01:59:17,891 --> 01:59:20,320
I think that if a male feminist goes to 
jail,

2713
01:59:20,321 --> 01:59:24,490
they get zero request for marriage.
They get none.

2714
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:27,190
But uh,
yeah.

2715
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:29,950
If some male feminist like gets arrested
and goes to jail,

2716
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:31,440
it's a wrap.
Yeah,

2717
01:59:31,650 --> 01:59:33,850
that's it.
But if you're a murder murder,

2718
01:59:33,851 --> 01:59:37,480
you'd probably get a lot because women,
there's a reason why men become.

2719
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:38,373
I mean there's,
there's men who believe in equality and 

2720
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:41,793
women's rights and then there's men who 
are really weasley and what they're 

2721
01:59:45,401 --> 01:59:46,234
doing is they just,
they're young and posturing and I think 

2722
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:51,940
those guys,
if they go to jail,

2723
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,630
crickets.
Well,

2724
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:56,810
either way they're in,
they're in jail so they're not.

2725
01:59:56,860 --> 01:59:58,510
They're probably not.
I don't know how it works.

2726
01:59:58,511 --> 02:00:00,940
I don't know to get places you can get 
conjugal visits,

2727
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:05,320
but I think it's dependent upon the 
jail.

2728
02:00:05,350 --> 02:00:08,500
You didn't cosby's getting any marital,
any proposals?

2729
02:00:08,530 --> 02:00:09,363
I bet he does.
I bet girls and trying to get raped by 

2730
02:00:10,961 --> 02:00:12,820
him,
believe it or not.

2731
02:00:12,821 --> 02:00:13,654
I bet there are some girls who would 
want caused me to drug them because 

2732
02:00:17,090 --> 02:00:20,590
people are fucking crazy.
People get their faces tattooed.

2733
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:21,910
People,
you know,

2734
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:24,190
there's people that are just straight up
nuts.

2735
02:00:24,191 --> 02:00:25,024
Yeah.
And when there's a high profile thing 

2736
02:00:27,341 --> 02:00:28,320
like that.
Yeah.

2737
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:29,920
I think.
I think when I think about that,

2738
02:00:29,921 --> 02:00:30,754
I'm like,
what happened to those people that made 

2739
02:00:31,781 --> 02:00:34,540
them to the point where they would be 
interested in something like that?

2740
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:37,050
The person that goes after.
Yeah.

2741
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:41,440
I have my theories about cosby.
I think that when that happened,

2742
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:45,100
when cosby first started doing that,
I think it was common.

2743
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:47,660
I think that whole slipping manish fly 
shit.

2744
02:00:47,670 --> 02:00:48,650
Dash fly.
Yeah.

2745
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:49,563
I think in the sixties and the fifties,
I think asshole men did that to women 

2746
02:00:53,170 --> 02:00:54,003
all the fucking time and I don't think 
people thought about the consequences 

2747
02:00:57,551 --> 02:00:59,740
and don't think people thought about the
rights of women.

2748
02:01:00,110 --> 02:01:03,460
I mean if you just think about like 
chauvinism in films,

2749
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:04,421
male,
Male,

2750
02:01:04,421 --> 02:01:08,380
chauvinist behavior and sexist behavior.
Men smacking women in films.

2751
02:01:08,580 --> 02:01:12,180
I mean it was really common.
Steve Mcqueen and Allie what it was when

2752
02:01:12,181 --> 02:01:14,650
the alley sheedy,
Allie McGraw,

2753
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:17,800
Allie McGraw beat the fuck out of her in
a scene,

2754
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:20,470
like an actual scene and she didn't even
know he was going to do it.

2755
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:23,650
Just beat the shit out of her and the 
look on film.

2756
02:01:23,651 --> 02:01:27,550
Right.
That was the thing that just came out.

2757
02:01:27,551 --> 02:01:29,200
It was like Brando was like,
oh we didn't.

2758
02:01:29,230 --> 02:01:31,600
We just sprung this sexual encounter on 
this woman.

2759
02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:33,280
Yeah.
That different game.

2760
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:34,203
Yeah.
It was a different world and I think 

2761
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:36,753
there was a lot of.
I mean he was always hanging around at 

2762
02:01:38,591 --> 02:01:41,720
the playboy mansion.
I think there was a lot of men that just

2763
02:01:41,721 --> 02:01:44,120
raped women and drug them.
I think it was common.

2764
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:47,420
I'm sure you've talked to many women 
that have had something dropped in their

2765
02:01:47,421 --> 02:01:48,060
drink,
right?

2766
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:48,750
Yeah,

2767
02:01:48,750 --> 02:01:50,160
for sure.
Crazy.

2768
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:51,053
There's darkness out there.
So much darkness out there and it's a 

2769
02:01:53,131 --> 02:01:55,260
bummer.
It's such a fucking bummer man.

2770
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:56,610
It's such a bummer.
And it's.

2771
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:58,140
And it's.
And it's.

2772
02:01:58,170 --> 02:02:01,890
Yeah,
it's a and you think about but with it's

2773
02:02:01,891 --> 02:02:05,290
crazy with cosby is like,
it was an until again,

2774
02:02:05,291 --> 02:02:05,701
it's.
I mean,

2775
02:02:05,701 --> 02:02:07,560
it's crazy to think now however many 
years ago,

2776
02:02:07,561 --> 02:02:10,350
Hannibal sending onstage,
like we all knew some version,

2777
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:13,020
like we'd all heard some stories about 
cosby and it's just sort of like,

2778
02:02:13,021 --> 02:02:14,070
oh well bill's bill,

2779
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:16,360
I heard about it on the set of news 
radio.

2780
02:02:16,390 --> 02:02:17,870
That's when I heard it.
Fuck yeah.

2781
02:02:17,950 --> 02:02:19,540
And nobody's going to touch him.
Well,

2782
02:02:19,541 --> 02:02:20,374
no one knew for sure.
Nobody knew to the extent I guess or 

2783
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:27,010
heard you had heard from someone that,
you know.

2784
02:02:27,930 --> 02:02:30,490
The crazy thing is when Hannibal said 
that on stage,

2785
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:33,340
the people that aren't connected to 
Hollywood were like,

2786
02:02:33,341 --> 02:02:34,174
wait,
what?

2787
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:37,330
Yeah,
what the fuck to say he's a rapist.

2788
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:38,813
Like that video went viral.
Millions of people saw it and I like 

2789
02:02:41,051 --> 02:02:43,230
what bill cosby rapes people and then 
everyone's like,

2790
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:47,290
but like he raped me and what?
It's crazy and now he's in jail.

2791
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:49,750
It's darkness.
Good fucking good man.

2792
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:52,060
Well it's crazy.
I'm good.

2793
02:02:52,061 --> 02:02:56,500
But crazy that it took so long and 
crazy.

2794
02:02:56,501 --> 02:02:59,560
That was only for three years.
He's got a three year,

2795
02:02:59,561 --> 02:03:02,040
sent three to 10 year sentence,
which is,

2796
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:03,520
that's the last one they could get them 
for.

2797
02:03:03,521 --> 02:03:04,354
Right,
right.

2798
02:03:04,750 --> 02:03:06,040
But I mean,
do you ever see him live?

2799
02:03:06,041 --> 02:03:06,874
Did you ever burn?
And I were supposed to go for all that 

2800
02:03:10,271 --> 02:03:11,104
shit went down and um,
we wound up canceling and then burn 

2801
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:15,910
wound up seeing him and he said it was 
amazing.

2802
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:16,953
Chris Rock said he was fucking amazing 
to Chris Rock said that he felt like he 

2803
02:03:19,631 --> 02:03:22,270
was an amateur after you watched cause 
he said,

2804
02:03:22,271 --> 02:03:22,871
yeah.
He goes,

2805
02:03:22,871 --> 02:03:24,460
I felt like I don't know what the fuck 
I'm doing.

2806
02:03:24,461 --> 02:03:25,294
Yeah,

2807
02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:27,580
I saw him once in Montreal during the 
festival.

2808
02:03:27,581 --> 02:03:29,710
I was hung over and I watched and I fell
asleep.

2809
02:03:29,711 --> 02:03:32,180
It was like a Sunday afternoon.
I was like,

2810
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:34,550
I'll sit down and tell her your story.

2811
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:40,140
Weird.
If you really enjoyed it.

2812
02:03:40,141 --> 02:03:42,380
If he was your best,
your favorite comedian.

2813
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,280
I know that would suck.
Would suck.

2814
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:48,420
It would suck more.
Who is your favorite standup when you,

2815
02:03:48,450 --> 02:03:49,320
when you were first starting?

2816
02:03:49,470 --> 02:03:50,540
Uh,
well,

2817
02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:52,080
let's see.
When I first started,

2818
02:03:54,330 --> 02:03:55,163
I started in New York sort of a moment.
The alt scene like I remember seeing 

2819
02:03:57,721 --> 02:04:00,390
Galifianakis early on and being like,
Jesus Christ,

2820
02:04:00,391 --> 02:04:04,080
what the fuck is this guy know he.
He does so good.

2821
02:04:04,081 --> 02:04:05,940
Yeah.
He'll pop up and be any so funny.

2822
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:06,953
I remember seeing bur because I had been
doing sort of more alt room stuff and 

2823
02:04:09,661 --> 02:04:11,730
then I remember seeing her come to like 
a,

2824
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:14,910
like the UCB in New York and seeing him,
you stand up and be like,

2825
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:18,420
oh,
he's doing him and he's doing it in this

2826
02:04:18,421 --> 02:04:19,254
space where people are not used to 
seeing just a straight standup and he's 

2827
02:04:21,990 --> 02:04:22,823
fucking killing.
I remember seeing him earlier on being 

2828
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:25,560
like,
Jesus,

2829
02:04:25,561 --> 02:04:28,060
this guy is fucking killing.
And,

2830
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:30,870
and being like very impressed me.
Like how do I do that?

2831
02:04:31,620 --> 02:04:33,480
And however many years later I'm still 
like,

2832
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:36,420
how do I do that?
When you were a kid,

2833
02:04:36,421 --> 02:04:38,460
was there anyone really stood out to 
you?

2834
02:04:38,461 --> 02:04:40,860
Consider Standard.
I mean I remember seeing delirious,

2835
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:41,783
watching delirious and then being like 
the specials that I had around me 

2836
02:04:45,661 --> 02:04:49,830
growing up where Carlin and Carnegie 
delirious and like Robin Williams at the

2837
02:04:49,831 --> 02:04:54,831
met or something or like those specials.
Those are big for me and I just remember

2838
02:04:55,261 --> 02:04:57,390
seeing delirious and being like 
memorizing though.

2839
02:04:57,420 --> 02:04:59,340
Did you ever get to meet Robin?
No.

2840
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:01,870
No.
Did you see them at the store?

2841
02:05:01,871 --> 02:05:03,000
A bunch or like around.

2842
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:05,710
I met.
I met him in the craziest way possible.

2843
02:05:05,770 --> 02:05:09,940
I did a set at the Improv and afterwards
I was taking pictures with people.

2844
02:05:10,060 --> 02:05:10,893
There was like a line of people and I 
was taking photos and this old guy with 

2845
02:05:13,481 --> 02:05:14,314
his white beard and glasses and a 
baseball hat came up and he wanted to 

2846
02:05:17,081 --> 02:05:17,914
tell me how funny thought the show was 
and I was talking to him for a couple 

2847
02:05:21,671 --> 02:05:23,560
minutes before I realized it was Robin 
Williams.

2848
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:26,260
She's and then in the middle of it like 
we're talking.

2849
02:05:26,290 --> 02:05:26,981
Oh,
thank you.

2850
02:05:26,981 --> 02:05:27,910
That's so nice.
I really,

2851
02:05:27,911 --> 02:05:29,200
I really appreciate it man.
Thanks.

2852
02:05:29,201 --> 02:05:33,340
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Holy Shit.

2853
02:05:33,790 --> 02:05:35,260
I never told them.
I knew I was like,

2854
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:38,560
but my brain saying I didn't know what 
to say.

2855
02:05:39,250 --> 02:05:41,260
I really appreciate that.
Thank you so much.

2856
02:05:41,261 --> 02:05:42,094
You know,
and,

2857
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:44,440
and you know,
he was just talking about a specific bit

2858
02:05:44,441 --> 02:05:45,274
that I was doing and you know,
like about how crazy it was and like I 

2859
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:51,520
love the twist in the turn and this and 
then I was like,

2860
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:52,510
wow,
thanks man.

2861
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:57,160
The guy waited in line with everybody.
That's why I just waited in line,

2862
02:05:57,190 --> 02:05:58,023
came by himself.

2863
02:05:58,050 --> 02:06:00,290
Did you see him doing some version of 
your bit?

2864
02:06:00,330 --> 02:06:02,890
Couple of days.
He would.

2865
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:05,160
Recipes,
recipes.

2866
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:07,363
You know what you did.

2867
02:06:12,730 --> 02:06:14,480
Thankfully he wasn't doing standup back 
then.

2868
02:06:14,630 --> 02:06:17,920
That was a,
when he was doing that show,

2869
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:20,060
remember he was doing that show,
the crazy ones.

2870
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:24,050
Oh yeah,
back and tried to do a sitcom before he.

2871
02:06:24,170 --> 02:06:25,910
Yeah.
But he,

2872
02:06:25,911 --> 02:06:27,470
yeah,
I mean I had friends.

2873
02:06:27,471 --> 02:06:29,240
Everyone would see him in like he'd 
come,

2874
02:06:29,450 --> 02:06:33,410
he'd come to do Improv at ucb or,
and then he would go and do you know,

2875
02:06:33,411 --> 02:06:35,330
he was sort of,
I don't know if he was doing stand up at

2876
02:06:35,331 --> 02:06:36,380
any point,
but you know,

2877
02:06:36,660 --> 02:06:39,680
I never got to catch.
I never got my like,

2878
02:06:39,770 --> 02:06:40,603
you know,
I have a lot of friends who I feel like 

2879
02:06:41,751 --> 02:06:44,400
got,
got a little touch from him and,

2880
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:46,390
and that feeling of like you are,
you know,

2881
02:06:46,990 --> 02:06:49,190
I mean because he was a guy who I was 
like,

2882
02:06:49,191 --> 02:06:50,900
oh,
that's what I like.

2883
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:55,460
You're doing what I like,
you're doing standup but it's characters

2884
02:06:55,461 --> 02:06:56,294
and you're doing all this stuff and 
you're acting and you get to be in 

2885
02:06:57,801 --> 02:06:59,540
serious movies and you get to be in 
common.

2886
02:06:59,570 --> 02:07:04,020
Like I was sort of like,
he was sort of sort of a model of like,

2887
02:07:04,030 --> 02:07:04,431
well,
I was like,

2888
02:07:04,431 --> 02:07:06,980
I think I would like to do what he's 
doing.

2889
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:07,863
Yeah.
He was so flexible in what he was able 

2890
02:07:10,361 --> 02:07:11,194
to do.
Yeah.

2891
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:13,570
Yeah.
Did you ever see patch adams?

2892
02:07:14,020 --> 02:07:14,853
No.
It might be the worst movie ever made 

2893
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:18,433
worse.
It's probably right up there with the 

2894
02:07:19,251 --> 02:07:20,700
Travolta Gotti movie,
but it helps.

2895
02:07:20,950 --> 02:07:21,783
Yeah.
I don't want to see that Travolta guy 

2896
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:25,480
today on the elliptical.
You fucking city.

2897
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:26,860
Every exec.
He says,

2898
02:07:26,861 --> 02:07:28,360
fuck every three words and you're like,
oh,

2899
02:07:28,361 --> 02:07:29,290
johnny,
look at you.

2900
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:34,450
This fucking city I fucking logo.
It looks so bad.

2901
02:07:34,630 --> 02:07:36,310
I love though.
There is something

2902
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:37,143
that I like.
I just like love the John Travolta 

2903
02:07:40,030 --> 02:07:41,440
patrol to that.
There's so many.

2904
02:07:41,441 --> 02:07:45,190
I like love about a man so deeply out of
touch.

2905
02:07:45,250 --> 02:07:46,260
I mean that's the thing is like,
yeah,

2906
02:07:46,290 --> 02:07:49,300
look it up.
Fucking thumbs fucking up.

2907
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:53,980
Me and my wife's Jewish,
just Sarah Palin and I love this fucking

2908
02:07:53,981 --> 02:07:55,870
city boy.
The,

2909
02:07:56,180 --> 02:07:58,600
the sexual chemistry between them is 
palpable.

2910
02:07:58,630 --> 02:08:01,530
Probably Real,
super rude.

2911
02:08:01,870 --> 02:08:05,920
You were talking about at the beginning 
of like cults and I'm like,

2912
02:08:05,921 --> 02:08:07,570
I'm thinking about.
I'm thinking about.

2913
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:11,020
I'm thinking about Tom Cruise and 
scientology.

2914
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:11,873
There is a man using every ounce of what
scientology's offering to make himself 

2915
02:08:15,371 --> 02:08:18,340
the best available man that he's capable
of being.

2916
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:22,890
Then you've got Travolta.
You know what I mean?

2917
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:23,733
Like you've got two versions of like 
Amanda who's becoming slightly out of 

2918
02:08:27,791 --> 02:08:29,980
touch with what he,
you know,

2919
02:08:30,910 --> 02:08:35,910
hey look at my fucking wig.
It's a good way.

2920
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:38,650
How amazing our wigs these days got 
great wigs.

2921
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:42,160
I mean that's a fucking incredible wig.
Thinning.

2922
02:08:42,161 --> 02:08:45,070
Just a little bit upfront.
You would think that's his hair.

2923
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:46,960
He's living the dream.
It's incredible.

2924
02:08:47,050 --> 02:08:47,883
He's living in a goddamn dream.
Are you okay with time we can wrap this 

2925
02:08:50,501 --> 02:08:51,191
up or whatever?
Yeah.

2926
02:08:51,191 --> 02:08:52,400
I'm 30 3:30.
Yeah.

2927
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:54,840
Where?
Where does that appear?

2928
02:08:54,841 --> 02:08:56,020
On the Oj thing.
Oh yeah,

2929
02:08:56,150 --> 02:08:57,520
that was.
I saw him.

2930
02:08:57,521 --> 02:08:59,350
That's amazing.
That little.

2931
02:08:59,590 --> 02:09:01,540
That little chin.
Is that his.

2932
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:04,690
He wore a little chin.
Chin Yamaka there.

2933
02:09:04,691 --> 02:09:05,524
It's unbelievable.
I remember seeing him at an award 

2934
02:09:07,331 --> 02:09:12,170
ceremony that and then when he had that 
little Chin thing and I was like,

2935
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:13,473
did he put that on after the thing?
I met him when his wife was on fear 

2936
02:09:16,931 --> 02:09:18,610
factor.
Really?

2937
02:09:18,611 --> 02:09:19,870
Yeah.
Kelly Preston was unfair.

2938
02:09:19,871 --> 02:09:23,050
She was on fear factor.
Celebrity fear factor.

2939
02:09:23,410 --> 02:09:24,700
David Hasselhoff.
Kelly.

2940
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:26,170
Wow.
Preston.

2941
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,480
How were they?
She was really nice.

2942
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:29,493
She was super friendly,
but I felt like I felt like they 

2943
02:09:34,061 --> 02:09:36,050
recruited people.
Yes.

2944
02:09:36,051 --> 02:09:37,440
Yeah.
I mean they were there for.

2945
02:09:37,450 --> 02:09:42,340
Scientology was sort of a stigmatized.
It was.

2946
02:09:42,341 --> 02:09:44,020
There was a lot of people that were 
joining it.

2947
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:47,700
What is going on there,
let's say as a black cap.

2948
02:09:47,770 --> 02:09:50,460
I love it out here is so crazy.
Fake looking.

2949
02:09:50,490 --> 02:09:51,323
That's like that magnetic man that you 
could like move the magnets around the 

2950
02:09:53,891 --> 02:09:57,140
created hair.
[inaudible]

2951
02:09:57,170 --> 02:09:58,720
hair looks like that.
That's crazy,

2952
02:09:58,721 --> 02:10:01,030
man.
That's the color.

2953
02:10:01,031 --> 02:10:03,310
Everything is wrong.
That's madness.

2954
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:04,840
Um,
but yeah,

2955
02:10:04,841 --> 02:10:07,960
she was super friendly.
She was really down earth.

2956
02:10:07,990 --> 02:10:09,850
Super Normal and friendly.
She's like,

2957
02:10:09,851 --> 02:10:10,684
these trenches are great and you know,
if you eat enough and you want to come 

2958
02:10:13,211 --> 02:10:14,470
and hang out later,
we could eat more.

2959
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:16,870
Yes,
we could maximize eating.

2960
02:10:16,871 --> 02:10:18,520
Sure.
Angela's and you can join,

2961
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:21,020
you can jump.
We can Olympic get your phone number.

2962
02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:24,160
Come from brunch.
He meters.

2963
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:25,053
Yeah.
I remember watching that go and clear 

2964
02:10:26,891 --> 02:10:28,600
the documentary and being like,
Oh,

2965
02:10:28,601 --> 02:10:30,400
I'm not scared.
Like they're not coming for me.

2966
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:32,170
Like Ms Dot Kovich is not coming from 
me.

2967
02:10:32,171 --> 02:10:35,900
He's coming for the people under him who
he sees as a threat.

2968
02:10:36,250 --> 02:10:37,880
Like I don't think he sees us as a 
threat.

2969
02:10:37,881 --> 02:10:39,980
Like I don't think he gives a fuck.
Us being like,

2970
02:10:39,981 --> 02:10:41,420
ah,
I don't know about scientology.

2971
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:44,540
He shields himself from anything like 
this.

2972
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:46,440
Any kind of criticism and.
Yeah.

2973
02:10:46,690 --> 02:10:49,760
But I do tell you that I had miscavige 
has data on.

2974
02:10:50,310 --> 02:10:51,081
Really?
Yeah.

2975
02:10:51,081 --> 02:10:52,050
Oh right,
because he's the,

2976
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:53,360
he's,
he's,

2977
02:10:53,361 --> 02:10:54,650
he left.
Yeah,

2978
02:10:54,651 --> 02:10:56,470
he fucking escape.
But that's what I'm saying.

2979
02:10:56,471 --> 02:10:59,860
Like if dad,
I'm scared because he's like Mrs.

2980
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:00,793
which is like my dad is a threat to me.
Like you and I talking about 

2981
02:11:04,340 --> 02:11:05,530
scientology.
I don't think ms.dot.

2982
02:11:05,531 --> 02:11:07,700
She gives a fuck.
It was a weird conversation.

2983
02:11:07,701 --> 02:11:09,170
What was he like?
Well,

2984
02:11:09,430 --> 02:11:14,430
he sad is he lost his whole life to this
nonsense and the sun's gone.

2985
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:17,930
Like he can't.
His son won't contact them.

2986
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:21,760
And it was his idea to get the family 
and the.

2987
02:11:22,450 --> 02:11:24,950
He filled the guilt of that.
Yeah.

2988
02:11:24,951 --> 02:11:28,160
The Sun rises through the ranks,
winds up running the whole fucking thing

2989
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:29,540
and that was something won't talk to 
them.

2990
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:32,360
My favorite thing is miscavige and Tom 
Cruise.

2991
02:11:32,361 --> 02:11:33,950
Shaking hands.
Yes.

2992
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:35,510
It's the best.
It's like this.

2993
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:38,440
It's this.
It's this tiny alpha men.

2994
02:11:40,070 --> 02:11:42,200
Men miscavige is trumping him where you 
can,

2995
02:11:42,230 --> 02:11:45,030
you can see Tom cruise trying to pull 
his hand away and Ms Dot,

2996
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:46,730
which is like,
I will not relent.

2997
02:11:46,731 --> 02:11:48,680
I will not release.
And you can see Tom,

2998
02:11:48,681 --> 02:11:49,514
Chris being like this Tinier man than me
has an even higher level of Alphas than 

2999
02:11:55,180 --> 02:11:57,770
I on.
And I will,

3000
02:11:58,100 --> 02:11:58,933
I will relent.
Well the real threat to them as Leah 

3001
02:12:02,270 --> 02:12:03,870
Remini mean.
What Leah Remini,

3002
02:12:03,871 --> 02:12:04,704
he's done like she is looking at it.
You can see him trying to pull this 

3003
02:12:07,930 --> 02:12:09,590
fucking salute.
They salute,

3004
02:12:09,591 --> 02:12:10,424
salute.
And then hand Tom Cruise like trying to 

3005
02:12:13,251 --> 02:12:16,490
pull his hand away and miscavige won't 
let it go.

3006
02:12:16,700 --> 02:12:19,910
It's really fantastic planting.
Yeah.

3007
02:12:19,970 --> 02:12:22,460
Unrelenting.
You can see it's trying to like,

3008
02:12:22,461 --> 02:12:25,880
you can see the hands turn to like come 
loose and he won't let it happen.

3009
02:12:26,330 --> 02:12:28,340
He's like,
and it's like that trump move.

3010
02:12:28,550 --> 02:12:31,220
My favorite thing is when they salute 
the,

3011
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:32,113
the picture of Lrh,
they saluted a shitty science fiction 

3012
02:12:36,531 --> 02:12:37,364
writer looking at.
He was wearing that big dinner plate 

3013
02:12:39,531 --> 02:12:40,364
around his neck.
They know and look at it is not a tall 

3014
02:12:42,951 --> 02:12:43,784
man.
And miscavige is he towers over Tom 

3015
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:48,060
Cruise.
Tom Cruise over.

3016
02:12:48,350 --> 02:12:48,861
Sorry.
Yes.

3017
02:12:48,861 --> 02:12:51,110
Yeah.
Look at that fucking giant gold medal he

3018
02:12:51,111 --> 02:12:54,190
wants by being the most awesome person 
in the universe.

3019
02:12:54,230 --> 02:12:55,370
But again,
I'm like,

3020
02:12:55,610 --> 02:12:57,290
I don't know.
Did you see the recent mission?

3021
02:12:57,291 --> 02:12:58,910
Impossible.
He's amazing.

3022
02:12:58,911 --> 02:13:02,090
It's amazing.
He's a fucking fantastic and I'm like so

3023
02:13:02,110 --> 02:13:03,710
onboard.
I'm onboard for the whole thing.

3024
02:13:03,711 --> 02:13:04,521
I'm like,
listen man,

3025
02:13:04,521 --> 02:13:05,354
you know how hard it is to get a movie 
made now to get anybody to pay 

3026
02:13:07,251 --> 02:13:08,084
attention.
Go learn to fucking flight helicopter 

3027
02:13:09,381 --> 02:13:11,210
and jump off a building and break your 
ankle.

3028
02:13:11,211 --> 02:13:12,950
Like fucking go for it,
man.

3029
02:13:13,010 --> 02:13:14,660
Well,
you know as well as I do.

3030
02:13:14,661 --> 02:13:17,360
You've been around a lot of actors.
They're all fucking crazy,

3031
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:20,120
but his crazy.
It's just a different kind of crazy,

3032
02:13:20,240 --> 02:13:22,430
but it's also a different kind of 
success.

3033
02:13:22,431 --> 02:13:23,780
Yeah,
but I'm like,

3034
02:13:23,781 --> 02:13:27,200
he's a guy who I feel like you would get
like,

3035
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:28,930
like he's like,
yeah,

3036
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:31,710
like whatever I need to do.
Like I will.

3037
02:13:31,950 --> 02:13:35,640
I will maximize myself the gold medal.
It's fucking amazing.

3038
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:36,990
I love it.
I get some volume.

3039
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:37,913
Let me hear some of this.

3040
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:42,040
I take this as a halfback,

3041
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:49,080
some inside joke that's like a good 
insights.

3042
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:52,860
I tagged you.
I will continue on my way.

3043
02:13:55,460 --> 02:13:58,700
These are the times now people.
Okay.

3044
02:13:59,300 --> 02:14:01,400
These are the times we will all 
remember,

3045
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:03,830
isn't that the song?
Were you there?

3046
02:14:05,210 --> 02:14:06,043
What did you do?
I think you know that I am there for 

3047
02:14:09,571 --> 02:14:10,404
you.

3048
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:11,303
Hmm.

3049
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:15,080
And I do care so very,
very,

3050
02:14:15,410 --> 02:14:17,900
very much.
That's why he's the best actor ever.

3051
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:19,850
You're full of Shit right there.
And we'll leave it.

3052
02:14:19,910 --> 02:14:23,950
Or do you think he's full of Shit?
I feel like he's on the verge of tears.

3053
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:27,770
I think he but he,
he's full shift for sure.

3054
02:14:27,771 --> 02:14:28,604
With everything he does.
I don't think there's a moment in his 

3055
02:14:30,081 --> 02:14:31,460
life where he's not full of shit.
Right?

3056
02:14:31,461 --> 02:14:33,470
But he's believes it's so deep.

3057
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:35,250
Please look at this.
The solute.

3058
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:37,560
Go back up,
back up a little bit.

3059
02:14:37,561 --> 02:14:41,150
I need to see that again.
Watch this dweller age.

3060
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:48,420
Anything about

3061
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:52,110
that guy l Ron Hubbard was a fucking 
maniac.

3062
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:54,770
Did you read going clear?
Did you just see the digest size?

3063
02:14:54,790 --> 02:14:57,360
Documentary book is fucking fantastic.
The book is.

3064
02:14:57,480 --> 02:15:00,090
He was fucking shit.
House rat.

3065
02:15:00,091 --> 02:15:02,090
Crazy.
Crazy on a boat.

3066
02:15:02,280 --> 02:15:04,470
Oh Jeez.
He was out of his fucking mind himself.

3067
02:15:04,471 --> 02:15:06,210
A bunch of metals.
Have you seen that?

3068
02:15:06,211 --> 02:15:07,160
There's a,
uh,

3069
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:09,990
there's a podcast called,
you must remember this and it's like all

3070
02:15:09,991 --> 02:15:10,824
about old Hollywood.
And it somehow circumvents a little bit 

3071
02:15:12,751 --> 02:15:17,751
of like l Ron Hubbard seen in like 
Pasadena with like all these other like,

3072
02:15:18,330 --> 02:15:21,600
you know,
spiritualists futurists are like.

3073
02:15:21,601 --> 02:15:23,670
And then it's like,
it's Cuckoos Ville.

3074
02:15:23,730 --> 02:15:25,230
They are,
they are,

3075
02:15:25,290 --> 02:15:29,940
they are cruising on their own fucking 
agenda and it's kind of amazing.

3076
02:15:30,330 --> 02:15:31,170
But he's,
yeah,

3077
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:32,333
it was,
I wish I had more information and put 

3078
02:15:34,530 --> 02:15:37,440
again in my brain doesn't retain the 
stuff I need to get it into scientology.

3079
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:42,500
The books help if you just maximize your
eat or whatever you fucking.

3080
02:15:43,030 --> 02:15:45,150
Do you ever do a stress test?
Do you ever go again?

3081
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:47,400
One,
one time I was filming a television show

3082
02:15:47,401 --> 02:15:48,234
in San Diego and we had downtime when 
they were setting up a scene and we 

3083
02:15:52,141 --> 02:15:52,974
happened to be at a park where they had 
one of those scientology booths set up 

3084
02:15:55,410 --> 02:15:59,790
and I went over there and the guy put me
through the whole thing.

3085
02:15:59,791 --> 02:16:03,060
I hold onto the cans and they're 
connected to the wires,

3086
02:16:03,061 --> 02:16:08,061
but he was so unenthusiastic he wasn't 
selling it at all outside ties.

3087
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:13,410
I don't know,
something in your past,

3088
02:16:13,830 --> 02:16:15,450
the tetons or.
I don't know,

3089
02:16:15,460 --> 02:16:17,610
man.
The guy had no energy for,

3090
02:16:17,660 --> 02:16:19,650
it was hilarious.
Worst salesman,

3091
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:22,830
I think they just make them do it,
you know,

3092
02:16:22,831 --> 02:16:23,664
and some people don't want to do it and 
next thing you know they've got a 

3093
02:16:25,451 --> 02:16:26,284
fucking conference table set up in a 
park and the stack of books and they're 

3094
02:16:29,411 --> 02:16:29,980
going nowhere

3095
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,790
in clear water.
Didn't no where near clearwater.

3096
02:16:33,830 --> 02:16:36,340
They were on the other coast.
I got to get to the fucking east coast,

3097
02:16:36,380 --> 02:16:38,860
goddammit man.
God bless him though.

3098
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:40,000
I,
I am like,

3099
02:16:40,001 --> 02:16:42,720
I am weirdly like,
I mean I don't know about goblets,

3100
02:16:43,020 --> 02:16:46,480
like dislocating people disconnect 
people from their families,

3101
02:16:46,481 --> 02:16:47,314
but I am like,
I am sort of have the feeling like 

3102
02:16:48,970 --> 02:16:49,803
whatever you,
if you can find something for yourself 

3103
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:53,013
that brings you some answers and,
and like gives you some comfort and 

3104
02:16:56,501 --> 02:16:58,600
motivates you to be the best person you 
can be.

3105
02:16:58,601 --> 02:16:59,170
I'm like,
yeah,

3106
02:16:59,170 --> 02:16:59,800
good,
good.

3107
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:01,360
Do whatever the fuck you want.
I don't give a shit.

3108
02:17:01,390 --> 02:17:02,740
I agree.
I do.

3109
02:17:02,741 --> 02:17:03,574
I am like,
if you're like dislocating people from 

3110
02:17:04,871 --> 02:17:07,510
their families and stealing everybody's 
money,

3111
02:17:07,780 --> 02:17:10,090
like whatever,
but whatever your personal choices.

3112
02:17:10,091 --> 02:17:10,960
I'm like,
go for it man.

3113
02:17:10,961 --> 02:17:13,060
I don't give a shit and quite honestly 
like,

3114
02:17:13,061 --> 02:17:13,850
why is it okay,

3115
02:17:13,850 --> 02:17:14,683
okay to be a Catholic and it's not okay 
to be a scientologist because Catholic 

3116
02:17:18,710 --> 02:17:19,880
Catholicism,
which I grew up with,

3117
02:17:19,910 --> 02:17:20,743
is one of the fucking nuttiest religions
filled with kid fuckers where they 

3118
02:17:24,410 --> 02:17:26,660
literally have their own country,
the Vatican's,

3119
02:17:26,661 --> 02:17:27,494
its own country.
They move priests around all over the 

3120
02:17:29,511 --> 02:17:30,440
world.
It happened.

3121
02:17:30,470 --> 02:17:31,303
There was a new case.
It just happened a couple of weeks ago 

3122
02:17:32,991 --> 02:17:33,824
in Pennsylvania.
They just found thousands of children 

3123
02:17:35,721 --> 02:17:36,620
that had been molested.

3124
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:40,980
Yeah,
no,

3125
02:17:40,990 --> 02:17:42,790
it's systematic.
It's crazy.

3126
02:17:42,820 --> 02:17:43,653
When did you.
Was there a moment in the church where 

3127
02:17:44,681 --> 02:17:45,071
you're like,
oh,

3128
02:17:45,071 --> 02:17:45,880
I'm out.
I'm done.

3129
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:47,030
Well,
I was really lucky

3130
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:51,310
without my parents split up in.
When my parents split up.

3131
02:17:51,340 --> 02:17:52,173
I went to Catholic school for one year 
after that and then my mom met my 

3132
02:17:56,741 --> 02:17:59,130
Stepdad who was a hippie and he was 
like,

3133
02:17:59,131 --> 02:18:01,330
this is fucking stupid,
and the next thing you know,

3134
02:18:01,331 --> 02:18:04,120
we moved to San Francisco,
so we were in New Jersey.

3135
02:18:04,121 --> 02:18:05,670
I was going to Catholic school a year 
later,

3136
02:18:05,710 --> 02:18:10,030
living in San Francisco next to gay 
people and living right off of,

3137
02:18:10,090 --> 02:18:11,290
um,
what's that?

3138
02:18:11,440 --> 02:18:12,273
Lombard street cricket,
a street in the world down near 

3139
02:18:14,681 --> 02:18:16,510
Fisherman's wharf.
So that's a change.

3140
02:18:16,820 --> 02:18:17,653
This is the craziest shift.
I mean this was also during the Vietnam 

3141
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:24,220
war,
so I went from being in this really sort

3142
02:18:24,221 --> 02:18:25,054
of repressive east coast Italian 
Catholic environment to being around 

3143
02:18:29,890 --> 02:18:32,560
nothing but hippies and gay people out.
Your mom wanted out?

3144
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:34,030
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3145
02:18:34,060 --> 02:18:36,100
Everybody wanted out.
My stepdad wanted out,

3146
02:18:36,101 --> 02:18:39,070
my mom wanted out.
They realized that there was also.

3147
02:18:39,070 --> 02:18:42,190
This was 1971.
I was seven,

3148
02:18:42,191 --> 02:18:45,790
so it was 73,
74,

3149
02:18:45,791 --> 02:18:46,624
74.
So it was like the heat of the Vietnam 

3150
02:18:49,700 --> 02:18:52,060
War.
The hippie movement was in full swing.

3151
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:57,420
Nixon I think was president.
It was craziness back then and fuck,

3152
02:18:58,061 --> 02:18:59,740
everybody wanted out,
you know?

3153
02:18:59,770 --> 02:19:01,240
Yeah.
Have you listened to that?

3154
02:19:01,270 --> 02:19:02,103
There's a podcast called slow burn who 
listened to see that it's all about 

3155
02:19:04,811 --> 02:19:05,644
Watergate and it sort of from the angle 
of like how it just took awhile to 

3156
02:19:08,711 --> 02:19:11,140
unfold.
Like it just like you're like,

3157
02:19:11,141 --> 02:19:11,681
oh,
okay.

3158
02:19:11,681 --> 02:19:12,514
Took it like this didn't happen 
overnight because they were like the 

3159
02:19:14,610 --> 02:19:16,570
Russia trump investigation.
Yeah.

3160
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:17,413
It's like the slow,
just like it's just slowly unfolding 

3161
02:19:20,230 --> 02:19:21,800
piece by piece and you're like,
uh,

3162
02:19:21,810 --> 02:19:24,160
overtime you're like,
oh,

3163
02:19:24,570 --> 02:19:27,800
right,
like these dominoes slowly fall.

3164
02:19:27,801 --> 02:19:28,490
And

3165
02:19:28,490 --> 02:19:29,930
in that one you're like,
I didn't,

3166
02:19:29,970 --> 02:19:31,490
I just didn't know that much about 
Watergate,

3167
02:19:31,491 --> 02:19:32,324
but I was like,
oh,

3168
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:33,343
like the water could happen.
And the election was five months later 

3169
02:19:36,291 --> 02:19:40,070
and Nixon won in a landslide.
Like the country was like,

3170
02:19:40,220 --> 02:19:41,270
the country was like,
eh.

3171
02:19:41,271 --> 02:19:43,820
Watergate said it's not that,
it's nothing big deal.

3172
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,570
And then it was another year,
year and a half before,

3173
02:19:47,740 --> 02:19:50,320
like he finally,
before he was impeached,

3174
02:19:50,340 --> 02:19:53,030
he took a while.
I did not know that.

3175
02:19:53,031 --> 02:19:53,864
Yeah,
it's kind of,

3176
02:19:53,900 --> 02:19:55,420
it's kind of crazy,
but it gets like,

3177
02:19:55,850 --> 02:19:56,683
it gets into some of the early stuff of 
like Watergate and after Watergate and 

3178
02:19:59,991 --> 02:20:00,824
all the,
like sort of the beginning of what I 

3179
02:20:02,181 --> 02:20:03,014
think became like legit legitimizing and
different versions of like conspiracy 

3180
02:20:06,741 --> 02:20:07,430
theories.
I was like,

3181
02:20:07,430 --> 02:20:09,160
what's really going on here?
Should,

3182
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:10,190
you know?
And it's,

3183
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:12,920
it's pretty,
it's 74 and he resigned,

3184
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:14,690
but he was reelected.

3185
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:15,770
Yeah,
he was reelected.

3186
02:20:15,771 --> 02:20:19,820
Watergate had happened.
Nobody had nobody thought about it after

3187
02:20:19,821 --> 02:20:22,990
his resignation was issued.
A controversial pardon by success.

3188
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:25,250
That's exactly what Mike Pence is going 
to do.

3189
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:26,233
Fuck.
You think you'll go down and you think 

3190
02:20:26,931 --> 02:20:28,230
he'll get impeached?
I don't know.

3191
02:20:28,660 --> 02:20:30,750
I just thought that more a few months 
ago now.

3192
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:31,593
It feels like I just,
he's so preposterous that as time rolls 

3193
02:20:35,961 --> 02:20:36,794
on where we're conditioned to his 
preposterousness just all of it loses 

3194
02:20:40,701 --> 02:20:42,330
its teeth.
Look,

3195
02:20:42,650 --> 02:20:45,230
I mean the stormy Daniels thing,
nobody gives a fuck about it anymore.

3196
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:45,550
Like,
yeah,

3197
02:20:45,550 --> 02:20:46,700
I fucked her.
So what?

3198
02:20:46,850 --> 02:20:47,541
But I feel like,
yeah,

3199
02:20:47,541 --> 02:20:48,374
I feel like they,
everybody knew he was fucking people 

3200
02:20:49,491 --> 02:20:50,241
before.
It's like,

3201
02:20:50,241 --> 02:20:52,420
it's,
if you don't apply yourself to a,

3202
02:20:52,910 --> 02:20:57,480
a normal moral framework,
then it's not like he was um,

3203
02:20:57,890 --> 02:20:58,723
super ethical guy.
Like who was the guy that was running 

3204
02:21:00,621 --> 02:21:01,460
for president?

3205
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:05,410
And it turned out that he was chief John
Edwards.

3206
02:21:05,420 --> 02:21:07,280
Yes.
While she was dying of cancer,

3207
02:21:07,281 --> 02:21:07,940
right?
Yeah.

3208
02:21:07,940 --> 02:21:10,280
And he's having an affair or a baby with
someone.

3209
02:21:10,390 --> 02:21:11,910
Yeah.
And that's cook.

3210
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:12,853
Well that's the problem with like when 
you see like Al Franken go down for 

3211
02:21:15,651 --> 02:21:16,510
like,
you know,

3212
02:21:16,580 --> 02:21:17,750
nothing,
nothing.

3213
02:21:18,050 --> 02:21:21,460
And it's because on that side it's like,
it,

3214
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:24,410
it's like the moral framework is like,
you can't do that to women,

3215
02:21:24,650 --> 02:21:25,700
but if you're,
if you're,

3216
02:21:25,890 --> 02:21:27,560
if,
if you're a trump guy,

3217
02:21:28,100 --> 02:21:30,950
then you're like,
it's not if you're a trump guy.

3218
02:21:30,951 --> 02:21:32,150
But it's like,
it's like,

3219
02:21:32,151 --> 02:21:33,620
yeah,
well that's how Donald is,

3220
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:34,341
right?
Like,

3221
02:21:34,341 --> 02:21:35,480
and he's like,
that's how I am.

3222
02:21:35,550 --> 02:21:39,240
Yeah.
So if below Riley was taking pictures of

3223
02:21:39,241 --> 02:21:41,390
the chicken grab there,
but everybody would go,

3224
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:42,253
yeah,
yeah,

3225
02:21:42,440 --> 02:21:43,330
exactly.
Yeah.

3226
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:44,930
But it's like,
if it's on the other side,

3227
02:21:44,931 --> 02:21:45,764
it's like,
well there's a moral framework there 

3228
02:21:46,461 --> 02:21:47,360
that you're like,
fuck,

3229
02:21:47,361 --> 02:21:47,960
we got to.

3230
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:49,550
If we're going to say that that's the 
deal.

3231
02:21:49,551 --> 02:21:51,380
Then we have to follow through that.
That's the deal.

3232
02:21:51,610 --> 02:21:54,680
Michael event.
It was going to have a naughty naughty.

3233
02:21:54,890 --> 02:21:56,060
Yeah.
This guy was running,

3234
02:21:56,090 --> 02:21:56,960
he was the,
the,

3235
02:21:56,990 --> 02:21:57,823
this would be great for two coasts 
proposing a three round mixed martial 

3236
02:21:59,901 --> 02:22:03,080
arts fight with Donald Trump jr for 
charity.

3237
02:22:03,081 --> 02:22:04,800
No joke.
And Michael Avanav,

3238
02:22:04,860 --> 02:22:07,070
he said this will be for two great 
causes.

3239
02:22:07,071 --> 02:22:09,350
I'm in what?
This guy.

3240
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:11,480
He's just,
he likes to play tennis.

3241
02:22:11,481 --> 02:22:13,250
Yeah,
he loves it a little too much.

3242
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:14,833
He's a little.
They were trying to get some show with 

3243
02:22:16,071 --> 02:22:17,720
him in the MOOC.
Right?

3244
02:22:18,830 --> 02:22:20,720
What's his name?
Carmen SCARAMUCCI.

3245
02:22:20,930 --> 02:22:25,840
He wants to run for president of Anohni.
He'll be the big threat and 20,

3246
02:22:25,890 --> 02:22:28,150
22 the Democrats.
I can't,

3247
02:22:28,230 --> 02:22:29,063
I can't,
I can't imagine that he's supposedly 

3248
02:22:32,581 --> 02:22:36,090
getting released from jail soon.
Wiener on good behavior.

3249
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:38,970
How is he still in jail?
What did he do?

3250
02:22:39,270 --> 02:22:41,100
The sexual with a kid or something like 
that.

3251
02:22:41,101 --> 02:22:42,380
Texting with the kids.
That what it was.

3252
02:22:42,550 --> 02:22:45,360
That's what I got to know for that 
smooth chest.

3253
02:22:47,730 --> 02:22:48,900
Okay.
And on that note,

3254
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:53,220
let's wrap this up.
What do you got going on?

3255
02:22:53,221 --> 02:22:56,610
Anything people need to know about?
Fuck A.

3256
02:22:56,611 --> 02:22:57,444
Yeah,
big mouse.

3257
02:22:57,450 --> 02:23:00,930
He's in twos out now on Netflix.
Hilarious fucking show.

3258
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:02,880
Thanks man.
Thank you.

3259
02:23:02,881 --> 02:23:05,130
One of the best animated shows ever.
Thanks man.

3260
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:06,740
I appreciate it.
Uh,

3261
02:23:07,470 --> 02:23:08,760
yeah,
I guess that's really it.

3262
02:23:08,761 --> 02:23:09,290
I mean,
that's,

3263
02:23:09,290 --> 02:23:10,123
that's the one I have is my 
autobiography that I've poured my life 

3264
02:23:12,661 --> 02:23:13,530
into it.
So I guess that's the thing.

3265
02:23:13,640 --> 02:23:15,100
That would be the thing.
You should promote it.

3266
02:23:15,570 --> 02:23:16,403
And you do insets at the store.
We went together the other night to the 

3267
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:20,580
store.
I do a show at Largo,

3268
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:22,580
a monthly semi monthly.
I'll actually wanted to talk to,

3269
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:23,820
about coming and doing the show at 
Largo.

3270
02:23:24,390 --> 02:23:25,250
Yeah.
Um,

3271
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:26,940
I do that Nick Kroll and friends and 
then,

3272
02:23:26,941 --> 02:23:28,080
uh,
yeah,

3273
02:23:28,081 --> 02:23:30,900
I got other shit coming down,
but it's a big mouth.

3274
02:23:30,930 --> 02:23:31,860
Big Mouth.
Big Mouth.

3275
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:32,910
Netflix.
Go Watch it.

3276
02:23:32,970 --> 02:23:33,800
Thanks.
Bye.

3277
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:34,633
Sure.
